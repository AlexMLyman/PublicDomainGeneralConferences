(Of the Presidency of Pioneer Stake.) 

This is a new experience for me, my brethren and sisters and friends, to address an outdoor gathering. I have had the privilege of performing two missions in foreign lands, but in both cases they were in fields where outdoor preaching is not allowed. I have attended but one outdoor meeting during my missionary experiences, and I had at that time no opportunity of addressing those who were present. I rejoice in the spirit of this meeting, and I trust that I may be able to say something that will be of an edifying nature to those present.  
  
While we were singing the first hymn this afternoon, my mind was led to reflect upon the conditions under which that hymn was written, and also the conditions which prevail today as compared with that time, — the hymn "Come, Come, Ye Saints, No toil nor labor fear, But with joy wend your way." This hymn was written under circumstances, as most of you know, in which the people, of whom we form a part, were in a situation of a desperate character. They had been despoiled of their goods, they had suffered privations, they had been driven from their homes; many of their friends and relatives had passed away as a result of the persecutions they had to endure; and they were in the midst of privation, disease, and suffering, in the middle of the winter. Wm. Clayton, who belonged to the Church at that time of deep distress, wrote this hymn as an encouragement to the Saints to prepare for the emigration to this country, at that time a wilderness.  
  
Now, in considering the conditions that surround us here, and the progress that has been made, I have been led to reflect upon the power of faith in the hearts of those who were a part of this Church at that time. I was led to reflect upon the declaration of Paul, as contained in the eleventh chanter of his Epistle to the Hebrews, where he says, "Now faith is the substance of things honed for, the evidence of things not seen:" and in that chapter he goes on to illustrate the power of faith. I shall read only a few of the statements that he makes in that chanter. "For by it (faith) the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that thing's which are seen were not made of things which do appear — But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." He goes on to tell of the faith of Noah, Abraham, and all those who were faithful men in the sight of God, men who accomplished things for the progress of His work and were mighty men of old. Now, we believe that a system of faith or religion that is not able to influence and establish in the hearts of its devotees a living faith, a faith sufficient to enable people to endure all things, to sacrifice all things, for the love of that religion, for the love of God, and sacrifice, if need be, their own lives, is not sufficient to bring men and women to salvation. It is necessary that people should have a faith sufficient to enable them to do everything, to sacrifice, if it were necessary, everything they possess for the love of the truth, for the love of God, in order that they may be able to obtain His favor and blessing.  
  
We believe, in order to obtain salvation, it is necessary that men should have an idea that God actually exists, that men should have an understanding and an assurance that the course of life they are pursuing is in accordance with the will of God. If men have this understanding, these ideas, then they are on the way to salvation. Now, if men have the belief that God exists, they also must have an idea of His character, His perfection, and His attributes, they must understand that God is indeed a God of mercy, of justice, of omnipotence, that He loves His children, that He is unchanging, the same yesterday, today, and forever, that He desires that all men should come unto Him, and live in accordance with His will, that they may obtain His favor and blessings.  
  
If men understand that God has made known, at various times in history, His will, and has undertaken to send men authorized of Him to proclaim His will, to make known that which He desires of mankind, to call them to live in accordance therewith, we can then perceive that it is necessary that men should undertake to submit their own will, desires and inclinations to the will of God. If they do this, they will pursue a course of life that is in harmony with the will of the Lord, in accordance with the commandments which He has made known; and, in pursuing that course throughout their lives, they will eventually obtain salvation in the presence of God, our Eternal Father.  
  
If mankind come to the condition of mind that they feel assured that God lives, they then understand that they can worship Him, they can understand His attributes, His character, and perfections, they can approach Him, and are able to ask Him for blessings, and seek to live in accordance with that which they feel He desires. As they grow in faith, as they develop a living faith, they will be able to sacrifice all that they possess for the love of the Lord, because of the fact that they have an assurance that He is wiling to bless them; and through that faith and devotion they will obtain salvation.  
  
The Latter-day Saints have accepted a faith which is indeed this living faith. It requires of men and women the sacrifice, if necessary, of their positions for the love of God and for the advantage of His work. We have accepted it with that understanding. The Gospel of Jesus Christ at all times, in all ages when it has been upon the earth, of which we have any record in sacred history, has required of men and women that they should give themselves wholly and completely to the service of the Lord, that they should be willing to submit their desires, feelings and inclinations to the will of the Lord, and undertake to do His will as He has made it known. The greatest exemplar of this doctrine is the Savior Himself, the only Begotten Son of the Father, who came upon the earth to do the will of the Father. He was willing to submit Himself, even though He was one of the Godhead, to do that which God the Eternal Father had given Him to do. He came upon the earth and performed a wonderful mission, the mission which He was called to perform, the atonement. Although He was free to do that or not as He chose, He was willing in the hour of suffering, the very hour when the greatest sacrifice had to be made, to say, "Nut my will but thine be done." He accomplished that atonement; He drank that cup of bitterness. He passed through death, and suffering such as men have never endured upon the earth, and was resurrected from the dead without His body having seen corruption. He was resurrected to eternal life, and triumphed over death, and became the mediator between men and God, whereby men also, through following in His footsteps, endeavoring to live as He lived, and to observe the principles and doctrines He established, may also come unto God and walk in the way to salvation. Through perseverance along this course, men and women will obtain salvation in the presence of our Father.  
  
This doctrine of the Church of Latter-day Saints is indeed a living faith, founded upon the principles of which I have spoken. It is necessary that men should have an idea that God actually exists. We have abundant evidences, before we join this Church, that God does exist, from various sources. We have it from tradition, we have it from sacred history, we have it from natural evidences. We can also in our own being feel that, inasmuch as we live upon earth and have being, there is one above us who is powerful, by whom all things have been created, and under whose guiding hand all things are regulated and controlled. We can understand the existence of a Supreme Being, through investigating the principles of the Gospel, as Jesus taught them, and as they are taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We can thereby obtain an understanding of the eternal nature of God, of His attributes, perfections and being. The Gospel teaches us that we are created in very deed in His image, that we lived before we came here, in the spirit; that we will exist after we leave this earth, and will be rewarded according to the deeds done in the body.  
  
Now, the principles and doctrines of the Church of Christ, as stated by Brother Eckersley, are clear and easily understood. This is the substance of what I wish to say: Every principle, every ordinance, every doctrine, that is promulgated by the Latter-day Saints is entirely in harmony with, in fact, are exactly the same as were preached by the Lord Jesus Christ and His apostles. They are in exact harmony with every principle that is contained in this Holy Bible; every principle and every doctrine that we believe in can be shown from the book itself, to be correct and in accordance with the Bible.  
  
The Savior's disciples were told when He was leaving them, after He was resurrected, to "go into the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believed not shall be damned, and these signs shall follow them that believe, In my name they shall yeast out devils. They shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall be healed." And many other signs of which He spoke should follow them that believed; they should receive of these gifts and blessings according to their faith. The Latter-day Saints believe in these things; they believe that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. They believe that the doctrines which the Savior taught are and were the true principles of eternal life, and that, in order to be saved, mankind must accept these principles and obey them, in every period of the world's history, if they are to obtain salvation. And they must be taught these principles. These principles must be declared, and these ordinances performed, by men who are duly authorized of the Lord, in order that they may be recognized and sealed in heaven by our Eternal Father; otherwise they are of no avail. I repeat, they are not efficacious unless they are in accordance with His will, and performed by those who are duly sent and authorized to perform them. The Latter-day Saints have accepted these principles. The Prophet Joseph Smith, of whom we have heard this afternoon, and in whom we believe as having been a prophet of the Lord, received them from heaven by revelation from God, and the principles which he taught are entirely in harmony with the principles contained in the Scriptures. This harmony is evidence that the principles which he taught were revealed from heaven. Joseph Smith was not qualified of himself, any more than any uninspired man is qualified, to make up a system of religion corresponding in every particular with the doctrines, principles, and ordinances which the Savior taught and established, and which were promulgated by His apostles after His death and resurrection.  
  
Every principle and doctrine and ordinance in this Church is for the betterment, for the development of mankind, and there is in it principles, doctrines, and commandments for the improvement of every side of the human character. This of itself is a testimony to me of the divinity of this work. Among other things the people called Latter-day Saints have received what is called the Word of Wisdom. It was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith many years ago, long before the world, or even the learned men, except in a few instances, had declared the injury that would come to the human body through indulgence in tobacco, strong drinks and other articles of a narcotic and stimulating nature. The Prophet Joseph Smith declared that these things were harmful; he received this word from the Lord by revelation. He advocated moderation in all things, temperance in everything; that men should not run to extremes in any particular, but endeavor to be moderate and temperate under all circumstances. We find today that men are coming to accept and advocate the identical principles that were declared many years ago by revelation from the Lord. Recently we had in our midst a renowned authority on health, on the human body, on those principles which go to make up healthy, strong men and women. If any of us who are believers in the doctrines of the Gospel had closed our eyes, and not known who was speaking, we would have declared that he was teaching the doctrines of "Mormonism" with regard to those things which concern the body; because he proclaimed principles which have been familiar to the Latter-day Saints for many years. They are now getting to be understood by the rest of the people of the world as necessary for human welfare.  
  
The Latter-day Saints believe in virtue, morality. We understand that men and women cannot remain true, cannot have a living faith in God if they are immoral, if they are unvirtuous in thought, in word, or in act. It is necessary that we should be true and pure in order to obtain the blessings of the Lord, in order that the Spirit of God may be with us and inspire us. We believe these things; we know these things. I know, and I desire to testify to every one who is present, that men and women cannot remain in this Church unless they are pure, unless they are virtuous, unless they are upright in morals and every other thing. Men and women will apostatize from the Church if they become unvirtuous. It is one of the principles of this Gospel that we must live pure lives; unless we do it we cannot be temples of the Holy Spirit.  
  
We believe, as Latter-day Saints, in the law of tithing. The leaders of this Church have been accused of misusing the funds that are paid as tithing by the Latter-day Saints, because they teach this law, which was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith many years ago. Those critics do not understand the fact that practically all of the money thus paid by the Latter-day Saints is returned to them in a way that they will get the benefit of it. Those present at a meeting in the Tabernacle the other night heard statements read of the money expended in the work that is being done by this Church for the benefit of the people. It was shown that from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of all that is donated by the Latter-day Saints is returned to them, in their various stakes and wards, for their own benefit. It was shown also that in addition to this directly, that there was a very large amount of money expended for the benefit of those in need of charity, suffering or lacking for the necessities of life. It was shown also that a very large sum is expended year by year for purposes of education among the Latter-day Saints, for teaching our young people principles which go to develop men and women educationally, and also in the theology, the understanding of the principles of the Gospel. We believe in teaching theology in our schools, as well as other principles which pertain to life, which are a part of the proper education of mankind. The Church is assisting, by its tithing fund, in performing a wonderful work in the way of missionary labor — such a work as has never been seen upon the face of the earth before. It has been taken as an ideal by many of the ministers in the world today. I know of many prominent men, in various churches, who point to the missionary system of the Latter-day Saints as being the ideal system, because it is the system which was inculcated and established by the Savior when He was upon the earth, when He sent His disciples out and said to them, Go out into all the world and preach the Gospel without money and without price. Preach the Gospel freely to all mankind; and he that believes the Gospel and is willing to submit his will to the Lord, and will develop a faith in God and submit himself to do the will of God, shall receive a testimony of it, and will obtain salvation through perseverance therein.  
  
The work in which we are engaged is of such a nature that it is constructive. It is not merely a system of principles or theories, but it develops, as I stated, a living faith in the hearts of the people, whereby they are willing to go, if necessary, to the ends of the earth to accomplish that which is made known to them as being, the will of the Lord. Young men and young women have been called to leave their homes to go out into all parts of the world to preach the Gospel, to spend two, three, or more years in this work, at their own expense, without receiving monetary help from the Church, sacrifice their time and means, and leave families for this purpose. They have done so, and they testify to hundreds of thousands of people of the divinity of this work. The people have left their eastern homes, having been driven therefrom, through persecution, into a wilderness a thousand miles from civilization, and in the midst of that wilderness, have developed and established a system of community life that is unparalleled anywhere in the world today, a community life that is praised highly by people everywhere. If we work this out to its ideal condition, as we eventually will, it will be indeed the perfection and ideal that all people can point to with praise. The people have been constructive in their character as a result of the faith that they have espoused, and they work together in unity and harmony. The people were able to settle differences when they were all of one faith; there were few quarrels; everything was arbitrated. The courts did very little in the way of settling difficulties. They were settled peaceably,without expense, and without hard feelings toward each other, because the people were united. These things are evidences of the fact that this is more than a mere system of theories. It is a system of life. It includes principles whereby men and women may learn how to live; and that is the reason and object of our being, that we shall learn to live upon the earth as the Lord desires of us, that we may know how to live in eternity, when we leave this existence.  
  
I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the testimony of the truth. I know that this work that was established under divine direction by Joseph Smith, was and is, indeed, "the power of God unto salvation" of all that will believe and obey it. It is a system whereby men and women may come to know the Lord, and obtain a testimony in their hearts that it is true, that it is divine, that God has established this work to remain, endure, and continue, to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know also, that not only was Joseph Smith a prophet of the Lord, that not only was he authorized of God to establish this work upon the earth, but that every man who has succeeded him in the presidency of the Church, every man who has been called to labor in the ministry and Priesthood, has been endowed with power from on high, inasmuch as he has endeavored to labor according to the will of the Lord. I know that these men who have succeeded the Prophet Joseph Smith in this Church, as prophets, seers, and revelators, have been and are indeed inspired men. I rejoice in the fact that this is the case, that this work has continued, that there has been no break in the rightful succession in the presidency of this Church, and that we have at the head of the Church today a man who is indeed inspired of the Lord, endowed from on high, empowered by our Heavenly Father to direct this work; and with him are twelve apostles, also inspired of the Lord.  
  
I rejoice in the testimony I have, because I know this work is true. I was born of parents who were members of this Church, and I have been taught from my youth up to seek the Lord in prayer. I have received testimonies in praying to the Lord, evidences of the divinity of this work. I have received answer to prayer in accordance with the faith that I have exercised. I have been taught by my parents to be pure and virtuous, and I know that these same principles are inculcated in the hearts of all the Latter-day Saint boys and girls as they grow up, that they may remain true, and pure, and virtuous in the sight of God, and thereby continuing on may obtain salvation in the presence of our Father.  
  
I pray that His Spirit may attend us, that everyone who is present, if we are converted to the divinity of this work, may seek to live it from day to day, from hour to hour, from year to year, and endeavor to make our lives better from one day to another, from one year to another, that we may progress in the principles of eternal life; and if we are not yet convinced that this work is true, that we will do as has been asked of us by the Apostle Paul, "Prove all things, and hold fast to that which is good." Seek and investigate these principles; if they are true, they are worth more than life itself. This religion is a living force in the world, and will continue to be so.  
  
May the Lord bless and help us to be true to these principles, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen.

The title of the beautiful anthem that will now be sung by the B. Y. U. choir is "The Lord hath brought again Zion."  
  
Brother Arthur Shepherd's attention being called to the poetic character of this passage, he seized upon it, under a seeming spirit of inspiration, and wrote the music in which the words are set. When his composition was submitted to the music-publishing house in Boston, they asked him, by letter, where he found those beautiful passages of scripture.  
  
I may say that in this anthem there is a concentrated expression of the great and true principles and message of God in the great last and new dispensation. There are two parts, the first of which is rendered in a solo; the second part as the chorus. The first part is recitative in its nature, and comes at the close of a solemn declaration of the Lord to the effect that those who reject His servants reject Him. And now the words of the anthem: (See Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 84, verses 99 to 102). 
 
The choir then rendered, in splendid style, the anthem referred to, Prof. Charles R. Johnson singing the tenor solo parts.

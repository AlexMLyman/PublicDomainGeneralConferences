I would just like to bear my testimony to you that the testimonies of my brethern, which have been so impressively spoken here today, and at other times, with reference to the divinity of the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and of the gospel of Christ, and of the Son of God are true â€” for I know they are true.

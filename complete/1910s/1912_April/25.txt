(President of Northwestern States Mission.) 

While listening to the remarks of our beloved President in the opening of this Conference, and hearing his statement concerning the wilful purpose of certain individuals who have had it in their hearts to destroy the influence and the character of the Latter-day Saints, by manufacturing from the whole cloth lies and falsehoods, for the purpose of deceiving the minds of the honest and of those who would, if they only saw the truth, receive it, I was led to think of a story I read, many years ago, concerning a man who lived by the side of a mountain. He came out one morning and found the earth enveloped in a great fog. He could see only a short distance ahead of him, but heard crackling sounds on the mountain side, the breaking of the bushes, but could see at first no object. He drew nearer to the location of the sound, and then, in the dim mist and fog, thought he saw a monster of unusual proportions, steadily creeping toward him. He became alarmed, but still desired to see more of this supposed monster. As he drew nearer still, he discovered to his astonishment, instead of it being a monster, it was a human being, a man, and, as it came still closer, to his great surprise, he found it to be his own beloved brother. I have thought how truly this represents the blinded condition of our brethren and sisters in the world with respect to the Latter-day Saints. Through the misrepresentation and falsehoods that have been manufactured, that have created the cloud or fog that has obscured the minds of men, they have been led to believe that we were monsters of some unusual proportions. In the times that are passed and gone, men were taught to believe that we actually had horns, and were unlike other human beings; that we were seeking the lives of our fellowmen, were nothing short of cut-throats and robbers. Even now there are persons who quietly whisper as they come within the precincts of this city, to the first stranger they meet, "Will you please show me a Mormon?" The chances are they are already addressing a member of our Church. But the impression has been disseminated so generally that we are unlike everybody else, that we are possessed of such evil propensities, and are such monsters, from that which has been represented concerning us, that we are not even human beings.  
  
Thank God, the mists that have obscured men's minds do not cloud them today as much as they did formerly — notwithstanding, a great effort is being made to manufacture more mist, more cloud, more fog to obscure the minds of men. The old system won't work so well today as it did formerly. The world is drawing nearer to the Latter-day Saints. The hundreds of thousands who are passing through this city, coming in contact with the members of the Church here, and observing it in its actual working operations are changing their minds, and we are coming closer to them. When I think of the representatives of this Church, the two thousand missionaries, or near that number, who are going from door to door, making themselves known as representative members of the Church, I am led to believe that their influence is causing a change of sentiment. Many times our missionaries have been denied the privilege and opportunity of living in the homes of the people, when it became known that they were "Mormon" Elders. Persons who have rooms to rent often turn our Elders away, or sometimes, with much misgiving, receive them. In some instances the Elder does not let his religious belief be known until after he has secured his lodging and accommodations, where he is going to pay for his room; and then, when it is found out that he is a "Mormon" Elder, they are almost ready to turn him out of their door. But, I have not yet found in my experience, with hundreds of Elders, where a "Mormon" Elder stayed for thirty days in the home of a person who had the greatest prejudice, but that person has become a friend of the "Mormon" people. Some have said to me, as I have asked those with whom the Elders stay — as I go about among them from time to time — "What kind of men are these 'Mormon' boys? The answer is, they are the best, cleanest men we have ever met in our lives. When they come to say good-by, there are tears shed by some of those who first were doubtful of receiving them; and they have said to me, "Don't take them away from us! or, send some others back to us." I say again, as we are coming out among the world and letting them see what manner of men we are, and as they are coming nearer to us, the fog is disseminating, and they are recognizing us, not as the monster, but as human beings after all, like unto themselves. As they come still closer to us, and learn the intent and purpose of our hearts, they will find, too, that we are not only human beings, but that we are their beloved brothers, having the welfare of mankind at heart, and doing more for the world today, without earthly consideration, than any other community in the world.  
  
"What greater love hath any man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend?" Our Elders, when they leave their homes, have no fear whether they shall lay down their lives or not. They have the spirit that was in their fathers when they sang, "And should we die before our journey's through, happy day, all is well." The same spirit burns in the hearts of their sons and daughters, who leave their homes and take their lives in their hands. They, too, can say, "And should we die before our journey's through, happy day, all is well." It has been my sorrow to have to bring home two of our missionaries who died in our field, one since our last conference, and to have the great sorrow to bring them home to father and mother and other loved ones who had anticipated their return in life with all fondness and affection. The last one referred to had been out two years except two days, when he was stricken down and taken away from us, and we had to bring his body home. But it did not shake the courage of the brethren who remained, nor did it daunt the feeling of the parents and brothers and sisters at home. No the Elders are willing to go; and fear not the consequences. Not long ago, I stood by the side of a father, who went to San Francisco, to receive his son who was returning home because of sickness that he had contracted in the islands. He was being brought home to be nursed back to health again. The father stood on the pier, waiting for the ship to arrive, and when it steamed into the harbor the sad news was broken to him that the son, whom he had expected to receive and take home to nourish to health, had died and had been buried at sea. Oh! the great load of sorrow that was cast upon his aching heart! He was to return to the family at home to bear that message to the mother of the boy; and he said to me, with tears streaming down his cheeks, "I loved him as I loved my own life; I have seven other sons, yet if I knew every one of them would come home or end their mission like that, I would give every one of them to the service of the Lord." What greater love has any people in the world than this, that they give their sons, their own lives, their means, and their all for the welfare of mankind. These Elders as they go from door to door have burning in their hearts a warm love and affection for their fellow men. How can they travel uphill and down, in the rain, in the snow, or in the mud, sometimes sleeping out of doors, seeking the souls of men, without begetting love for the children of our Father? I want to say to you, that the world will discover, as I have already observed, that we are their best friends, their own beloved brethren.  
  
Not only will they discover this, but they will discover that they need us, and need also the message that we have to bear to the world; and that they cannot get along without it. Their great efforts to stem the tide of infidelity, to stop the ravages of that spirit of unbelief that is undermining the churches, destroying the ministry, and making vacant the pews, seem to be unavailing. Out in the city of Portland, Gypsy Smith, one of the greatest revivalists the world has today, held a series of thirty meetings, where thousands of people listened to his eloquence and came under the spell of his power. During that time, some three thousand persons came forward, and signed cards that they would affiliate with some one or other of the hundred and ten chuches that joined in that great revival. After the meetings were over, the choir of a thousand voices had been disbanded, the tabernacle was silent, and the men and women were left to themselves, a sad wail comes from the hundred and ten ministers who joined in the revival, that less than 10 per cent, of those who signed cards actually became identified with the church. What is the matter? O, there is that something lacking that took possession of the souls of men when they cried out on the day of Pentecost, "Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved ?" and the answer came from that authorized servant of God — not come here and sign cards or come here and give me your hand, but — "Repent of your sins, every one of you, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." That is what the world is lacking today; and they are trying to hold their fort, to maintain their cause, without those powers and blessings that come from the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; and they fail.  
  
A great religious movement has been inaugurated looking to interesting men in the church. Few men attend churches in the world. There is only a scattering few in the midst of a comparatively large attendance of women; and a movement, that has behind it millions of dollars, is being pushed from city to city to interest men in the church. When I have thought of this, oh, how my heart goes out in gratitude to the God of heaven who has given us the key by which this great question can be solved. If they ever solve it, they will have to copy us, and learn of us. For, behold, the Church provides something for every male member to do — the Priesthood received by them placing a portion of responsibility upon each individual member. No man will be interested unless he works. The Lord has solved that question for us; and the world is trying to solve it without His aid and assistance; if they ever solve it, it will be because they have imitated "Mormonism" again.  
  
A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of standing, with some of my brethren, in a sacred spot in the western part of New York, in the sacred grove. As we lifted up our voices in song, where Joseph knelt and poured out his soul unto God, my heart was melted and softened within me, and I felt then as I never have before in my life, that Joseph told the truth, the absolute truth, that indeed he did have the glorious vision, that the Father and the Son did stand before him, that he saw them and heard the voice of the Son of God. My heart went out in thanksgiving to have the assurance that Jesus, the Savior of the world, who died for men, who gave His life for us, who is the life and the way, still loves our Father's children, still has interest in them, and did come in the age in which you and I live, and spoke to man again.  
  
Calling your attention to the remarks of President Robinson, that a great number of educated men disregard all the evidences that have been given with respect to the existence of Christ, throw it aside and disregard it, and even among those professing to believe the Bible there is a lack of faith that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, possessed of the powers He exhibited, according to the testimony of the writers of the Scriptures; I felt to say yes, we could repudiate all that, and yet "Mormonism" would establish the fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He lives, and that He did, in our own day, appear and talk to men in the flesh. That is our witness and testimony. Although all other evidences may be destroyed, we have this knowledge of Him, that He lives, and that He is the resurrected Son of God, that He is the life and the way. We do not know the means and ways by which He shall bring about the resurrection from the dead, neither do we know the means nor ways by which nature's products, that a few months ago seemed dead, are brought back. The flowers withered, the grass decayed and lying flat upon the earth; no evidence of life in the trees; they all seemed dead; yet, behold, by the magical powers God has organized in the sunlight, and the power of other agencies, here is new life springing up; the tree puts forth its bud, its leaf, the grass springs up again, and there is a complete renewal of that which was apparently dead. I have thought, in this connection, of the fathers and mothers, husbands and wives who have laid their loved ones away stilled in death, the lip that once spoke loving words speaks no more, the hand that fondly caressed us drops with no sign of life in it, and we say they are dead. They shall as surely live again as the tree that slumbers through winter. While they shall not come forth by the light of the sun, that shines and gives life to vegetable nature, yet they shall live again just as really, truly, and certainly as these flowers shall grow again, when He who has the power of life within Him, even the Son of God, the Master of element, exercises that power to raise men from the dead. There is no doubt about that. The world needs the testimony that Jesus is in very deed the Christ, and that our Father in heaven is a reality, a tangible being and not a myth.  
  
The world also needs the knowledge concerning baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, with the multitude of doctrines and principles relating to this matter! O, what a clearing up of doubt there was on this subject when, 83 years ago, John the Baptist appeared and laid his hands upon the heads of men, conferring upon them the Aaronic Priesthood, and told them the way and manner by which they should baptize by immersion for the remission of sins, and gave them authority to commission others. I say the world needs this knowledge; the people are wandering in darkness and ignorance without it; and they will never obtain the blessings they seek except by obedience to the law of the Lord, and the authority of Jesus Christ. Neither shall they be able to organize the Church of Christ, and give it all its officers, organization and working perfection, unless they receive authority from heaven, and adopt that method, pattern and system which was given to the Prophet Joseph by the revelations of God. They are seeking to solve the question of finance, for maintenance of their churches. They are not able to do it except they shall take a lesson from "Mormonism." The great Baptist convention in the city of Portland a few months ago spent two days discussing this subject. I had a visit from two of the leading ministers who asked me to explain the system of tithing as adopted by the Latter-day Saints; after hearing my explanation, they readily conceded that it is the only thing. Again, I say, they need "Mormonism" to solve that question.  
  
Also, in connection with the observance of the fast day. (In this relation, I desire to impress upon the Latter-day Saints at home and everywhere, that we are not, according to the report that has been made by the Presiding Bishopric, doing our full duty in this respect). How can the poor be provided for, and be properly taken care of? The Lord had devised the way and the means, through each and every one of His Saints fasting one day each month, that thereby they may feel the pangs of hunger, and sympathize with the hungry; that they may also be brought to realize, in this experience, their indebtedness to God for the food they have, and for the other comforts of life As they experience these things, they gratify their feelings in giving to the poor that which they have saved by fasting, and this becomes a blessing to them both spiritual and physical, cultivating magnanimous and generous attributes, by denying themselves and ministering to those who are in need. Instead of our Church showing, in fast offerings,an average of only 17 cents per capita a year, it ought to show, at least, ten cents per member per month; thereby we would, by complying with this, have saved the Church in the neighborhood of $200,000 last year, that was taken from the tithes to help the poor. Let us set that example, brothers and sisters, in this respect to the world, that they may see how the poor may be provided for; for, if each individual in all the world fasted from two meals once a month, the money thus saved could provide ample means to care for all the poor in all the world. Let us maintain that standard the Lord has given, so that the world may see the beauty of this thing. 
  
So, in my heart, I feel confident as I live that the world needs "Mormonism," and will come to understand it better as the years pass by. I hope that you and myself, and all members of the Church living in obscure wards, or stakes, or elsewhere, that we shall live up to the standard the Lord has given; and by our example, preach a sermon that our words cannot convey. I repeat what I have said before: If we ever convert the world, it will be through our lives, and not through preaching our doctrines, for they will be attracted to our lives long before they will appreciate the truth of the principles that have made our lives what they are.  
  
God help us, my brethren and sisters, to appreciate these blessed privileges that have come to us, and let us be conscious all the day long that we are pioneers for the rest of the world. This Gospel is for all men, and God has called you and me, and our fathers and mothers, to pioneer the way, to fix the standards, to maintain the cause, come what will or what may, that eventually we may prove a blessing not only to our own posterity, but to all the world, as God intended we should, even to aid in the salvation of the souls of men.  
  
May the Lord help us in this grand and noble labor, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen.

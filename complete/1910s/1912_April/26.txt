(President of Northern States Mission.) 

Our beloved President Joseph F. Smith, said, in the beginning of this Conference, that every faithful Latter-day Saint was entitled to the spirit of revelation to guide and direct him in paths of righteousness, and to instruct him pertaining to the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in his early ministry, declared in power to the people who listened to him a similar doctrine, that every one who would repent and be baptized for the remission of his sins should know that he was a prophet, and that this work was of the Lord. This is in harmony with the Master's words recorded in the 7th chapter of John, beginning with the 16th verse: "Jesus answered and said, My doctrine is not mine but His that sent me, and if any man will do His will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of Myself." This doctrine of revelation has been true in every age of the world when the Lord has had a people upon the earth, or servants commissioned to do His will. It is true in this day when the glorious promise has been given that there will never again be a time when there will not be men and women who will have and enjoy the spirit of revelation, and know that God lives, and that His Church and Kingdom is in the earth.  
  
In the meridian of time our Savior established His Church. He delivered the principles of life and salvation to all who would listen; but the world was not ready for the consummation of all things. The Church and the officers established by the Master were changed, and the ordinances, of the Gospel also were changed. Instead of Apostles, Seventies and Elders, popes, cardinals, and other officers were created. Instead of the simple principles, much of heathen religion was grafted into the church. Following the primitive days came a time of darkness, and after the darkness a day of reformation. The Lord inspired mighty men, Luther, Calvin, Huss and others, who arose in behalf of religious liberty and gave to the world much light and much freedom all in harmony with what was predicted should come to pass. Through many great men, and much tribulation, the world was prepared for the light of the restored Gospel and the establishment of the Church in the last days. Closely following the reformation, the Pilgrim and Puritan fathers came to this glorious land of liberty, that they might worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience; but though these Puritans, Pilgrims, Baptists and others like them came to gain liberty in worshiping God, they quarreled among themselves, and separated in religious factions; but in their jarring they learned much that has been good for us in this day. After gaining liberty from England, following a long struggle, good men and wise were selected to form the Constitution of the United States. Some of those men were so illiberal in their ideas pertaining to religion that, for a time, they refused to have a prayer offered in the constitutional convention; but the motion of John Adams finally prevailed, and a good churchman was selected to offer a prayer, that their minds might be moved upon to frame a constitution that would secure liberty to all who would come to this land.  
  
As Latter-day Saints we believe that our Father in heaven looked down in tender mercy with an answer, and that the Constituion of this glorious country was inspired of God. Our Father prepared this nation and inspired its laws, that He might establish a people in the land of promise that would teach principles of truth and righteousness. He likewise sent His heavenly servants to ordain men to the Holy Priesthood to officiate in the things of God. Since the establishing of this work we have been under persecution, notwithstanding our right to worship as we please. Satan has done his utmost to thwart the purposes of our Father, and from the time he attacked the Prophet Joseph in the woods, during that first prayer, he has attacked almost every other thing that has been done under inspiration from heaven. The Prophet Joseph, in his day, had gone through so much persecution that he said, when he was in Nauvoo, that "puny man might just as well put forth his arm to stop the Mississippi river in its course as to try to stop this glorious work of our Father." Men cannot stop it. It is not man's work; it is the work of the Lord. He has established it. He is at the helm, and has ruled and overruled all things for its onward progress. I am thankful, my brethren and sisters, that I know that it is decreed that this work will be bigger tomorrow than it is today. Every Latter-day Saint who has kept the commandments of our Father, and done His will, knows of the doctrine. The young men of Zion who go into the world, with little experience, just as soon as they do the will of the Father, or strike a blow for truth, learn that this is the work of God. They stand forth boldly before the world, and proclaim it to their fellow men. They proclaim it in power and simplicity, and their testimony cannot be refuted, for it is the truth.  
  
On one occasion a gentleman said to me, "Where did you get your authority, Mr. Ellsworth?" I told him I was ordained by so-and-so, who was ordained by some one else, and he was ordained by Joseph Smith, and Joseph Smith was ordained by Peter, James and John. "I don't believe it," he said. I responded, "That does not affect the truthfulness of the ordination; and may I ask, can you trace your authority so far? I have a connecting link to heaven, while you trace your authority transmitted by a few men, and they self-ordained." These young men who go out from Zion bearing testimony that God has established this work, may not be believed by the world in general, but it is true nevertheless. The Latter-day Saints, both at home and abroad, can lift up their heads and look the world in the face and rejoice in the glorious truths that have been given, and rejoice that they are privileged to be Latter-day Saints is very deed. I think it is a privilege and a blessing above all blessings that have been given upon earth to the children of men. We have a right to sing a new song, to rejoice in the truth, and put forth our best efforts in our work.  
  
The Book of Mormon that was given to the world has been one of the greatest witnesses concerning the divinity of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. While the world at large, has not accepted it, yet they cannot disprove its divine authenticity. Every man who has distributed that book, by selling it or otherwise, has sowed good seed. It carries a strong power of testimony and conviction of the truth, and those in the world who have received that book in their homes have been softened in their feelings towards the Latter-day Saints. I am thankful beyond words for the opportunity that I have had in distributing this great testimony concerning the divinity of Christ. In the Doctrine & Covenants, we are given an admonition not to forget it, and not to forget the teachings given therein, and those who do will be under condemnation. I firmly believe that book is one of the greatest witnesses our Father has given in the last days to bring the world to believe in Christ, the Lord. Our friends in the world profess a belief in Christ as the greatest religious teacher; but it is truly a revelation to them to tell the story that Jesus Christ, who was born of Mary, was, in fact, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. The Book of Mormon is most powerful in its testimony concerning the birth of Christ and His divine origin. It will help the world to know Him, and to receive the spirit of revelation in their hearts. It will help them to know that our Father has a work in the world that will save His children if they will but listen and obey. The last few years, in the United States especially, there has been a great work done in testifying of the truth of the Book of Mormon, and I rejoice in the spirit that has been manifested, and the work that has been accomplished. There have been upwards of 175,000 copies of the Book of Mormon distributed in the United States alone, and it is pleasing to know that the spirit of the book follows it in to the homes of the people. In almost every home where one of these books has been left, our Elders find if not a friendly feeling that the spirit of animosity and hatred has been much lessened.  
  
I rejoice to know that the work in the Northern States mission is increasing and that the people are looking with much favor towards the west and towards the Latter-day Saints. They are singing our praises concerning the material work that has been done in this part of the earth; and while they do not know that religion is the foundation of this great material success, yet in a few years, I am firmly convinced, they will discover that true religion has been back of and underneath this great movement. That it is God and His power and influence that have been the cause and motive power permeating all this wonderful work.  
  
The world has not been able to destroy the work. The time is past for that, and the time is fast coming when they will be led to see that the truth is with us. The world contains many honest people, and their hearts are warm towards any good work that has gone forth in the world. They are doing much to care for the sick and afflicted, and the poor among them. They sympathize with the distressed and those who mourn, and they seem to be feeling after the truth. I believe we can look in favor upon them, and let our hearts, go out in love toward them. Though we were driven from Missouri, and banished from Illinois, we can continue to send our sons and daughters, fathers and husbands back to them, with hearts full of love, and plead with them to repent, and worship God, and believe in his Son Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world. We will continue to do that, for we can never convert them in any other way. Thousands who have reviled us have done it ignorantly, and thousands of those who have persecuted us have thought that they were doing God's service. The Latter-day Saints have no animosity in their hearts. They are sending their sons and daughters back to the very homes from which they were driven, and to the very states that banished their fathers and mothers.  
  
I rejoice to have the privilege of laboring in that part of the world from which we were driven. We have found many honest men and women there, whose hearts are true, and we are growing more and more to love our brethern and sisters in the world, and to labor among them with hearts full of compassion and sympathy. Our Elders have gone to those cities, states, and counties from which we were driven, and the honest men and women are listening to their message, and receiving, by the spirit of revelation, a knowledge that this is the work of our Father in heaven.  
  
I have had the privilege of laboring with about a thousand young men, and a few young women missionaries, and I do not believe that I can put my finger on one that has gone astray. Almost without an exception they have proven themselves true, and their testimony has gone straight to the hearts of the honest, and they can stand, rejoicing, this Easter Sunday, in the presence of a risen Redeemer. I feel in my heart thankful that we have a testimony of the truth, and have the privilege of bearing it to the children of men; that we do know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that He has spoken in these last days to His servants and given unto us a message of salvation.  
  
May we appreciate the position that we occupy in the world; and may the prophets of the Lord who stand at our head live a long time upon the earth, and be magnified in the eyes of the people. May they be given power over the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, that we may attain the full standard in the work that God requires. May the mothers in Israel impress their sons and daughters with the feeling that they are indeed the children of God, and that upon their shoulders rests the responsibility of proclaiming to the world that Jesus is the Christ, that He has started a work, a marvelous work and a wonder, the work of our Heavenly Father for the salvation of the souls of men, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

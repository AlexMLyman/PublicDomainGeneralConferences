I think it is generally understood, by the congregation, that the choir which has furnished us music today is the Brigham Young University Choir. Brother Anthon C. Lund is the leader. We feel to thank them for the most exquisite music they have furnished during the two sessions of this day; and we pray that the Lord will bless them henceforth and forever, in the good work that they are doing.

I would like, also, to say this, that Brother Hyrum G. Smith, who has been selected to fill the vacancy resulting from the death of the late Patriarch John Smith, is a literal descendant of John Smith, but he is his grandson, and not his own son. The grandson has been a clean, pure, intelligent boy; he has been faithful and exemplary throughout all his life, and has never been addicted to any habits that he had to abstain from, to be in harmony with the principles of the gospel. The question of looking over the children and grandchildren of the Patriarch was submitted to the twelve apostles, as it is the duty of the twelve apostles to look after, and select, and ordain evangelists in the church; and after due consideration, they have unanimously recommended the grandson of the late Patriarch to fill the place of his grandfather.

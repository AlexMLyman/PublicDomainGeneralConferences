In order to extend greater privileges to our young men who may be called to go on missions, to prepare themselves to some extent by the study of the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, a school of correspondence has been established, and Bishop Edwin S. Sheets has been appointed as the principal of this school, whose office is at the Bishop's Building, 40 North Main Street in this city. We would like the presidents of stakes and the bishops of wards to encourage their young men, and such of the young sisters who may be called upon hereafter to take missions abroad, to open a correspondence with Brother Sheets, that they may in that manner prepare themselves to some extent for missionary labor in the fields abroad. This, of course, applies to those who are not able to spend the time needed to go to the church schools and there take a regular course in missionary work. This correspondence course is for those who cannot spare the time, to go to school and who may use this privilege and opportunity to gain information by means of correspondence. In this way many of our brethern will find themselves much better prepared to go on missions than they would be if they were called without this preliminary investigation and preparation.

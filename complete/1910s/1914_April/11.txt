(President of Northwestern States Mission.) 

The majority of men and women in the world are perfectly willing to go to heaven, if they can go on their own terms. We discovered from the report of President Smith, yesterday, that there are some also in the Church who would like to go on their own terms, who would like to lay aside some of the requirements the Lord has made and substitute their own notions, and they believe that their ideas of what they ought to do are as good as what the Lord has given. We missionaries are constantly under the necessity of showing men and women in the world that the wisest forms of worship devised by the wisdom of men are woefully inefficient, and not to be compared with the terms given by Him who has the right to make the requirements.  
  
I have undertaken to illustrate the necessity of strict and absolute obedience to the requirements of the Lord, by appealing to the knowledge of men and women with respect to the necessity of yielding obedience to the laws of the land, or complying technically with the terms of a will. If I shall inherit a property granted or left to me by my father, grandfather, or any one who has a right to will or deed, or give to me anything that he possesses, you who are acquainted with matters of this character know that if one is possessed of property, he has a perfect right to state the terms upon which his children or descendants shall inherit the property; and you know also that if you wish to inherit such interests as are left to you in a will you must strictly and absolutely comply with the terms of that will, or you cannot inherit.  
  
I take it that if there is any hope in the human heart of a hereafter, of a life beyond this, of a heaven, of a place of progress, it has to come through the revelations of God to man, largely revealed in the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. While others have had some faith that there is a hereafter, we have been given positive and absolute assurance, by the demonstrations given in the power manifest both in the preaching and in the miracles, so called, in the life of Jesus Christ. There are better evidences to believe that what He said is true, than to believe the statements of any man. He spoke not only with authority, but acted as possessed with power such as no man has ever exhibited while upon the earth. I say that if we shall inherit salvation, a life beyond this, a glory, it shall be through the wonderful and wise provisions instituted by the Lord Himself.  
  
If we believe the Scriptures, we shall accept the statement of John, that "in the beginning was the Word," and by the Word was the world made, "and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." In other words, that Jesus Christ, under the direction of His Father, was the organizer and builder of this world; that out of the elements that existed in space, He, the great Master, compounded, produced and materialized this substantial world upon which you and I live; that we are indebted to Him, and to our Father in heaven, for this life that we are enjoying, the bodies that we have, the beautiful world that we inhabit. We sometimes wonder where our heaven will be, that is, the people of the world wonder. We Latter-day Saints have no reason to doubt where our heaven will be, for the Lord has made known to us, that this splendid world that has been provided for us will ultimately be redeemed, having obeyed the laws of its being, and become celestialized, the home of celestial beings; so that if we shall ever come into heaven, or heavenly conditions, it will be, ultimately, upon this redeemed world. Jesus Christ has been the organizer and the builder of it, possessed with power to do all that.  
  
Sometimes I am astonished at the expressions of men professing to believe in Jesus Christ, and His claim to be the Son of God, when they doubt that He had the power to turn water into wine, and create and materialize a few loaves and fishes. When I think of their objection, I think of the splendid world that has been produced by the wonderfully marvelous power, ability, and knowledge such as Jesus Christ exhibited. If Jesus had planted a vine, and waited until the little grape had developed and had absorbed from nature those particular ingredients necessary to produce the wine, it would have been considered no miracle. Or if he had sown a few bushels of grain, and waited until they had matured and materialized, it would have been considered no miracle to have gathered it and made bread to feed the multitude. But where did all that bread come from? Where do the millions of bushels of wheat that are raised in these valleys come from? Who brought it here? All the pioneers did was to bring a little seed. Where do the millions of gallons of wine that are produced come from? No man produced it. It was in the elements, and the seed possessed the power to abstract or draw from the soil, and from the atmosphere those particular elements that are everywhere in attendance, provided by the great all-wise Providence. Those instruments, those seeds, had the power to extract from nature her resources, and produce, after a season, the wine or the bread, through that life activity drawing from nature's resources to feed man and beast. Who do you suppose gave to the vine its power to work this mirable in nature? Who do you suppose organized the kernel of grain, gave it the power to draw from nature those component parts necessary to make more grain? Why, the Creator. Do you not suppose that He who organized this splendid world knew of plant life? The Scriptures tell us that even the herbs of the field before they grew were organized, prepared to live in this world; and He who organized it also organized the plant life, and animal life, and assigned to each its place and sphere. He who did it, who organized the vegetable life, the tree, and the kernel of grain, reserved to Himself the power to work this miracle independent of the vine or the kernel of grain. And when I look into the splendid world organized by His superior power, with all its beauty and all is variety of life, and then listen to the objections of some short-sighted individual who doubts His ability, after organizing such a splendid world, to produce a little wine or produce bread, to me it is almost ridiculous.  
  
When I think of this, I also think of the objections made on the part of those who doubt that there is a God in all the universe, and hold that nature happens to produce these results by some chance or other, or in a mysterious or peculiar way known only to nature, that she assumes to act in that particular way. When I think of some of those who have traveled around the world, and some who have not gone out of their own counties, trying to discover if perchance God will be seen manifest in some state or nation, or somewhere else in this world, I wonder at their ignorance of the position that they occupy when they deny that there is a great and mighty Creator. If you have traveled around the world and have not discerned Him, and have not found satisfactory evidences of His existence, or manifestations of His presence in this world, you yet are not entitled to say He is not. If you are properly informed, you will know that this is but one of the smallest of all the worlds, and that it belongs to what is known as our solar system, comprising many worlds revolving around the sun. We had better, perhaps, go out to our big brother Jupiter, that is so much larger than our world, in an effort to find evidences of God. If we failed to find Him there, we might endeavor to explore the sun, the great ruling, controlling world in our system, that our astronomers tell us is so much larger than our earth that it would take upwards of three million worlds like this to make one the size of the sun. And then, if our finite minds failed to find sufficient evidences of God in that, should we be entitled to say that He is not? No! Let us look still higher, and we will discover there are fifty millions of suns in the view of man, like unto our sun, one rising above the other in majesty and power. There are suns so great it would take ten thousand the size of ours to make one like unto those mighty suns, and then if we still had not been able to satisfy ourselves, or discover sufficient evidences of the creative power of God, are we then entitled to assume that we have not found evidences of His existence? No, for with all the power you might have to discover these, you might justifiably conclude that there are innumerable millions of worlds that man cannot see. If a man started out to reach the nearest of those worlds outside of our solar system, they are so far away that it would require over four years, traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, the rate that light travels, before he would reach any of them; and if he tried to search further in the universe, it would take unlimited millions of years, traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles per second. It would be about as easy for him to find the extent of the universe as it would for him, if he were traveling up the Mississippi Valley in an airship, far above the earth, to discover a mustard seed hidden in that valley.  
  
For a puny man, able to travel only a little way around this world, to assume to be so great, so wise and so mighty that he can declare that God is not, reduces him to such an insignificant atom, so little, so small, that he, if he could only see himself, would be utterly disgusted with his supposed wisdom. The wisest and greatest men in science have always been the humblest. It was Sir Isaac Newton, who had advanced further than most men, who humbly said, I have been but as a child playing upon the sea shore; and have succeeded in discovering a few puny pebbles and shells, but the mighty ocean lies before me unexplored. The great man is the humble man, and he knows that he don't know it all. When men begin trying to discover, as they say, the origin of life upon this world, they manifest the lack of sufficient reasoning power, they should remember that in the midst of this creation there are worlds infinitely older than ours. It is absurd to try to account for the origin of life on our earth, just as absurd as it would be to come to Salt Lake City to find evidences of the earliest existence of human life upon the American continent. We would naturally begin such research in those places where people lived before they came to this city. Likewise in the mighty universe, we would have to go to those worlds that are older than ours to discover some of those secret wonders of nature that we try to discover on this earth. In the meantime, would it not be wise for us to listen to the words of those who are better informed than we are, to obtain information upon conditions in the worlds that existed prior to the organization of this world? Surely it would be wise to listen to some of their suggestions and advice with respect to these matters.  
  
There are men who are forming all sorts of schemes for their own salvation and exaltation; but I assert that Jesus Christ had the right to designate the way by which you and I may inherit the salvation that we desire, and that we may have eternal life and being upon another world, or this world, we are indebted to His wise and wonderful provisions. He has a right to say what I shall do; and if I shall inherit I must obey absolutely that which He has required. I am not dictator in the case; I have no right to demand the estate. As before remarked, perchance my father, or my grandfather, leaving an estate, leaving a will decreeing upon what terms I may inherit, may have specified some terms that I do not like, but I cannot inherit unless I shall comply technically and strictly with the terms of the will. And so, though I may feel that there are some things in the Gospel that I do not understand, or that to me might seem unnecessary, or undesirable, I have no right to absolve them, or lay aside the terms provided by the one who has the right to specify what should be followed. Yet many assume to say we do not know whether these are the correct terms or not. There are numerous churches, each contending they have the correct plan. They arrogate the right, and they are interpreting according to their own will, and adding to the confusion. How eminently necessary it is that the true will may be made known, and all of its terms made perfectly clear and plain. After all the evidences of doubt which have gathered around this will, through the notions and interpretations of men, how important are the words of the Master, coming direct, ringing through the courts of glory, to us anew, giving the exact terms of that will, making it plain, clear of all doubt, and specifying with certainty what the requirements are. And if I discover the terms of the will (I am speaking as an illustration), can I legally inherit property without I comply with those terms on my own part? No; I must find some legally appointed judge, who has the right and authority to administer on that will, and I must go to him in a judicial court, and there comply with the terms of the will, and have the judge certify that I have done it, and by his decree that I have complied with the terms legally, he may give me title to the property. Seeking to evade those proceedings would not give me title nor claim.  
  
Just so it is with men and women in the world with respect to the words prescribed by Jesus Christ, the terms by which they may inherit eternal life and the blessings of heaven, the beautiful and splendid celestial world that He is providing for us. I must not only know what the words of the will are, but I must find the legally appointed servants of God who have the right and the authority to administer the terms of that will. I cannot do it by finding some man who claims a right without divine appointment. I must find those who are legally appointed and rightfully constituted as the delegated authorities of heaven. I assert to the world, to all churches and to all men, that here has been restored and established the authority of the holy priesthood, the only men delegated by God to administer the terms of this will to man. In the priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are the rightfully constituted and delegated authorities. These bearers of this priesthood can trace through the hands of one, two, or three men the authority that has come upon them directly from Peter, James, and John, who received their divine appointment under the administration of Jesus Christ Himself. I cannot get legal title to these blessings and ignore this priesthood established by God. I shall discover, too, that I will not be able to do anything that the Lord has required at my hands without compliance with His way, His terms. If I undertake to produce electricity, and abridge some of the essential things necessary to its production, will I get electricity? If in the realm of chemistry, I undertake to ignore some of the well known and established principles by which I shall produce certain chemical results, will I get the results? So on the farm, if I neglect to use some of the methods well known to be necessary in the cultivation of the soil, shall I get the results? or in any field of activity? No. Law rules and priciples govern everywhere; and I will discover that there are rules, laws, and principles, with respect to men, that have been divinely established, and not formulated out of caprice. Jesus Christ said, "I came not to do my own will, but the will of the father who sent me." The law that He announced and established, was under the direction of the Father, and so even the Father could not abridge it, or make it null and void. He complied with it Himself, and through compliance with it became God. Jesus is the Christ, and you and I will discover that it is necessary for us to comply strictly with His law in order that we may inherit.  
  
I suppose there are some in the Church who will excuse themselves, and say on account of some good they do, "I am a pretty good man, I go to meeting, I look after the sick; but I smoke once in a while, I drink a little, I take a glass of beer sometimes, I pay a little tithing, one hundred dollars a year, I think that is pretty good, I will come out all right." By such conduct we excuse ourselves, trying to deceive ourselves by only partly complying. There is a scripture that is not thoroughly understood, wherein Jesus said, If ye fail in the least of these, ye are guilty of breaking the whole. Now I want to say what appeals to me with respect to that matter. I do not think that if a man keeps two-thirds of the commandments of the Lord that he is as bad off as the man that is not keeping any. There are those who assert that all roads lead to heaven. But there are many roads that lead to Salt Lake City, or to New York, and no matter which road you take, it will bring you there. I am perfectly agreed with my friends that every man that does some good, that good will take him so far on the way toward the goal of salvation, part of the way. Some of us get just about one-half the way, some of us two-thirds; but until we get to the goal we do not get what we are seeking for. We discover that all men who do good are led toward God. Nevertheless, I must comply with each and every requirement made if I wish to attain eternal life. While there may be many other ways that lead into a place, I cannot enter only by the straight and narrow gate; and I must pass muster before I enter and meet all the requirements and conditions. If I have gone two-thirds of the way, there is just that much less for me to do; and there is just that much encouragement for the man or woman until they comply with all, but they do not get the desired results. Just as in the case of the electricity, I may comply with two-thirds of the requirements to produce electricity; I may comply with nine-tenths, but I do not get it until I have complied with all. I am just that much nearer the goal, but I don't get the result until I comply strictly and absolutely with the law. So I say again that it is necessary that I shall be a strict observer in this regard.  
  
Jesus did not require anything that was unnecessary, in one single thing. How can I expect to inherit the place promised by obedience to the law of tithing, except I keep that law? I am deceiving myself if I am only a tithe payer on account. The grand and glorious principle is that I am an honest tithe payer, and that I pay the full tenth. And the greatest asset is in the training of the man and the woman that are found complying with this principle, better and greater than possessing much land in these splendid valleys. While the world may build splendid cities, and railroads, and accomplish other enterprises of a wonderful character, they may be morally weak. The greatest asset of this Church today is the splendid manhood and womanhood this Church is building, the training and perfecting of men and women through obedience to the Gospel. I appeal to you, my brethren and sisters, that you shall not treat lightly a single requirement made, and that we shall be strict observers of those obligatons enjoined upon us. We deceive ourselves if we think we can get the results, the promised blessings, except we comply with the laws on which they are predicated.  
  
The Lord bless us and give us strength and courage to comply with these requirements, not minimize one of them, but so live faithfully in the observance of our part in the stewardship over which we preside, that it can truly be said of us: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many." Nevetheless, never shall we hear these words, in time or eternity, until we have been faithful, strictly and absolutely, according to the requirements. God bless us to have faith in these things, and enable us to live so that we will comply even with that which we have not yet seen, that may be required, and trust the promises that have been made by Him whose promises never fail, I ask, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

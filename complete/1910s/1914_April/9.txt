It is observed that from one end of this great auditorium to the other all heads are uncovered. The sisters have voluntarily removed their hats so we are confronted by a sea of intelligent faces, instead of feathers and ribbons. Aunt Emmeline Wells, President of the Relief Society, sets the example. The members of the Tabernacle choir, who have found it difficult to take care of their millinery, have conformed to this custom of the Church. The President desires me to make this comment, and say that the universal observance of this custom is very much appreciated by the General Authorities of the Church.

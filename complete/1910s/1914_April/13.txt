May the blessings of heaven go with you, my brethren and sisters, as you disperse from this meeting. 

Believe in the Lord. Believe that He is, and that we are His children. Believe in Him as the Creator of the universe, the heavens above us and the earth upon which we dwell. Let us put our trust in Him. Cry to Him continually. Pray to Him in your fields that the harvest may be abundant; as you attend your flocks and herds, that there may be increase; as you transact the business of your stores and counting houses, or whatever vocation the Lord has given you to labor in, let that labor be performed in His name, and with faith in Him. He does control the destinies of men and of nations. His kingdom will come and His will be done upon earth as it is in heaven. Every man and woman who have put their trust in Him, who have taken upon them the name of His only begotten Son, the Redeemer of the world, and entered into covenant that they will serve Him and keep His commandments, if they keep those covenants shall be brought back into His presence and be crowned with glory, immortality and everlasting life, and shall be redeemed from death.  
  
I pray the blessings of the Lord upon our brethren and sisters who have furnished this splendid musical program, and all others of His people who are here, and those who are away from us. May God's blessing be with His Church eveyrwhere, I pray through Jesus Christ. Amen.

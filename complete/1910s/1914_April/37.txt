CLOSING REMARKS. 

None

I feel quite certain that the spirit and feeling and earnest desires which have been made manifest during the meetings of this conference, are all pleasing and acceptable to the Lord. I am satisfied that He has approved the words that have been spoken, the counsels that have been given, and the admonitions that have been offered to the people of the Lord. In conclusion, I desire simply to say: God bless all Israel, and may the Lord especially bless those on whom rests the responsibility of presiding in the various organizations of the Church, and especially those on whom rests the very great responsibility of presiding over the stakes of Zion, the presidents and their counselors, and the members of the various high councils of the sixty-five stakes of Zion; all the bishops and their counselors, in the seven hundred and twenty-four wards organized in the Church, as well as those who are presiding over the various branches of the Church and over all the missions in the world. The Lord bless them; give them wisdom, judgment, discernment, purity of heart, and power of government and of counsel, that they may be potent in the guiding of the affairs of the Church in all the departments of the Church in which they are concerned and over which they are called to preside. The Lord bless our auxiliary organizations, and those who stand as presidents and directors in them, that they may also accomplish very much in the direction of their labors for the good of the youth of Zion and of the children of the Saints. God bless you, my brethren and sisters, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

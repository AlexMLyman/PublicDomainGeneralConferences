(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

In standing in your presence, brethren and sisters, I do so in the hope that through the blessings of the Lord I may discharge this duty acceptably to my Father in heaven, and to the good and blessing of all those who are gathered together in this meeting of the general conference. My heart has been made glad in listening to the words that have been spoken to us by President Rey L. Pratt, of the Mexican mission, and by President Melvin J. Ballard of the Northwestern States Mission. The words of one of the inspired writers have been forcibly impressed upon my mind. The doctrine that has been taught unto us this morning is not the doctrine of the men who have been teaching us. It is the doctrine of our Father in heaven; and the only way whereby men can understand and know the truth of the doctrine, is by receiving and testing the principles that have been expounded. When the Redeemer of men tarried in the flesh and undertook to teach men the way of salvation, He could only make them a promise of this character. He was looked upon as an imposter. Men did not believe that it was possible for one of so lowly an origin to be the Great Redeemer and deliverer for whom they had been looking for ages. His words have been in my mind, He could only say to them: "My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent me. If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself."  
  
My brethren and sisters, I thank the Lord that in my own experiences I have demonstrated the truth of this announcement made ages ago, and I take it that every Latter-day Saint, every missionary, every man, and every woman, who have taken upon them the name of the Redeemer of the world, in the way that has been appointed by the great law giver, have had like experiences, and they have learned the absolute truth of these things because they have lived in harmony with the principles of the Gospel. They have had evidences come to them by the divine aid of the Holy Spirit that have swept away all doubt, and that have made them know in very deed, that the doctrines that they have attempted to put into practice are necessary and constitute the saving principles of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
I have been greatly impressed, my brethren and sisters, with the manifestations of that spirit of kindness and forgiveness, that is taught in the Gospel, through meeting quite recently in Arizona, many of our people who have been expelled from their homes in Mexico. I found among them a wonderful spirit of forbearance. It has been marvelous to me to listen to their words of kindness, and the manner in which they defend the people who are responsible for their expulsion from their homes at the present time.  
  
While sitting here, listening to the words of President Pratt, in relation to the persecution and opposition that have been brought to bear against the work of God, I could not help but think of one very remarkable and unexpected testimony concerning our vitality and wonderful growth that I heard from one of our faith, many years ago, when I was laboring abroad as a missionary. Our indifference at times gives cause for fear that we ourselves, here at home, under Gospel influences, and under the guidance of those who have been authorized to teach and instruct in the way of salvation, we, ofttimes do not appreciate the marvelous manifestations of the divine favor of our Creator. The matter to which I have made reference occurred in a lecture that was delivered by a man who has been world-renowned in his time, Charles H. Bradlaugh one occupying a position among the British people similar to that that has been occupied by Robert G. Ingersol in America. I was at one time invited, with other missionaries, to attend a lecture delivered by this noted man in the city of Bristol. His theme was "Is Christianity a Persecuting Religion?" He gave abundant evidence of being familiar with the religious history of the world, particularly those portions of religious history that have been made during periods of persecution. It is a, sad thing to know that there have been dreadful deeds committed in the name of religion. Those who have professed to be ministers of the gospel have ruthlessly murdered their fellowmen in the name of the lowly Nazarine. In the name of the Being of all beings who has ever lived upon this earth who has stood for peace, who has been the embodiment of forbearance, and charity, and love. Who has taught the doctrine that we have heard announced in this conference, that when we are smitten upon one cheek we should turn the others also. In His name so-called religious teachers have been guilty of some of the most dreadful deeds that blacken the pages of history. Possibly there have been men in times past who have felt that they were doing God's service when they persecuted those who did not see and understand, and believe as they understood. This noted lecturer was familiar with all such pages of history, and he brought to the attention of the gentlemen who were gathered together to hear him, many very dreadful stories. An opportunity was given at the close of the lecture for those who were present, to propound questions, among others a young man arose and asked if it was not true that in the commencement of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ He stood practically alone, and that He was from the ranks of the lowly, and that those who gave attention to His testimony were drawn from the same ranks; that He and they were without power; that they were few in number and were without worldly influence, and also without wealth. The answer was that was the condition. Then this question was propounded. "Was there not arrayed against this lowly individual, and the people who had been drawn to Him from the ranks of the poor, who, like Himself, were without power and influence, the might of the great Roman empire, and was it not the decree and the determination of those who were in authority to crush out the religion of the Nazarine, and to destroy those who had given allegiance to Him?" The answer was frankly given, that that was the condition. Then the young man asked, "How do you account for the preservation of the early Christian Church in the face of this deadly opposition, if there be no God; if there was no hand of providence extended over them how is it that they were preserved? It is the story of the world that when great strength and might is arrayed against weakness, weakness must give way, and be destroyed, and that strength and might prevail. How is it those early Christians were not destroyed?" I was very interested in the question. I wondered how it could be answered, because a very wonderful story of remarkable preservation has been written concerning the early Christian church. When Mr. Bradlaugh arose to make answer, he said, "Young man, away out in the western part of America there can be found a people who have had similar experiences to those of the early Christians, a people who have had arrayed against them the might of one of the mightiest of nations, a people who have had arrayed against them the religious prejudices of all other peoples, and yet in spite of all opposition, in spite of this prejudice and religious hate, that people have made remarkable headway, and the history that they have written during recent years is more remarkable than anything that has been written concerning the early Christian Church. I speak, he said, of the 'Mormon' Church of Utah. Do you think that because of their preservation there is any evidence that the power of God has been extended over them, and that the great being whom you worship as Father and God, who created this earth upon which we dwell, has had His hand made manifest in their preservation?" Of course there went forth from that gathering of people, when this statement was made, a titter of laughter. Who was there in that gathering that could say that the great God was interested in the "Mormon" people? Who was there that could feel that because their wonderful history paralleled the history of the early Christians that there was a living God who had decreed that they should be preserved, just as those early Christians had been preserved, until the work that our Father had designed in the meridian of time had been by them fully accomplished? In my judgment it was not wisdom for me at the time to take any part in the discussion, as I was a guest of the chairman of that meeting, and in fact had been informed that discussion was not permitted. A question could be propounded and the answer would be given according to the view point of the lecturer. When the answer was given by the lecturer the question was closed. In my soul on the occasion named, there came a very great joy, my brethren and sisters, I was filled with happiness to know that when one of those men of the world, who was well posted in history, and who was recognized intellectually as a giant among men, when such a man sought for a religion and people to parallel the history of early Christians, he found my people. He brought the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the attention of the audience, and bore record that our history was the history that paralleled the story of the early persecution and opposition to the Church of Christ in the meridian of time.  
  
I thank God that the same forces are in operation today that operated in that day, that the same Being has revealed the everlasting Gospel that planted His Gospel in the meridian of time, and that He has established this work in this our dispensation with a great promise, a promise that has been so often sounded in our ears, the promise that never in this age shall the cause of truth be overcome, or given to another people. God has planted this glorious work. He cries to men, He cries to you and to me to test the doctrines of His Gospel. He does not demand anything of any one of us beyond our power, only that we shall, in a spirit of humility, with a feeling of proper anxiety in our souls, seek to know the truth, and give those things that He has revealed an honest, fair test. The Lord God of heaven has Himself pledged to every man, and to every woman who will thus seek to understand the truth, the promise that he or she shall discover it. This knowledge is not to come by means of scientific discovery, or by the ideas that have taken possession of men in these latter times, educationally; but in the only way that God has ever given, that is, by the revelation of the Lord God to the individual, through the manifestations of the Holy Spirit, thereby dispelling darkness through the power of the Holy Ghost, that truth may burst into the soul, and that the human mind may be lit up by the inspiration and power of God, and be made to know that God lives, that He is our Father, and that He has in very deed revealed the way of salvation.  
  
To my soul this knowledge has come; I desire to repent, and to have faith and confidence in my Father in heaven, and I bear record of the truth of this work. This work that He has commanded shall be heralded among the nations. That responsibility has come unto us, that we shall go to every nation and to every kindred and to every tongue and to every people, sounding the message of the Gospel, and calling men to repentance, and point out to all the way of everlasting life. Every soul who has tested the message has been made to know the truth, and in that manner the knowledge of this work, its truth and power, has come to me. I bear this record, in the name of Jesus Christ, my Savior. Amen.

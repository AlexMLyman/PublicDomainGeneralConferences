I am sure that we have all been edified this morning by the splendid discourse delivered by President Smith, and by the music we have listened to. It is indeed good to be here. It is remarkable to me that so many of the members of the Church are able to be present at the opening session of this conference. This house is now filled so that if those who are standing were seated, every seat would be occupied.  
  
I wonder how many of us have examined ourselves this morning, during the remarks of President Smith. How many of us have asked ourselves the question, "Are the delinquencies referred to in any way applicable to me?" For, after all, the purpose of our coming together is that we may receive the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, and that we may be taught the things that will be beneficial to us if we apply them in our lives.  
  
From all portions of the world comes the glad tidings that investigation of the truth is increasing. From every mission field, without exception, comes the request for more missionaries than we are able to supply, and in many cases they are sorely needed. Many of the wards keep their full quota of missionaries in the field, and are reaping the benefits that follow such a course.  
  
While speaking on missionary work, I desire to call your attention to the fact that, in the mission field, our representatives are doing a magnificent work, and the result of every effort is manifest in numerous conversions to the truth. I would like to direct the attention of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops of Wards, and parents in Israel to the fact that many of our elders are expending more money in the mission field than they should, and that the excess of money they are using is often harmful to them and to the cause of God. Some of our elders send home for funds with the expectation that their demand will be met, no matter what the financial condition of their family may be. I believe they do this thoughtlessly, in most cases, but the fact is the elder who expends much means in the mission field usually does it in a way that it is not fruitful of blessings to himself, or beneficial to the Church. We would like those in authority in the stakes and wards to give this matter attention, and see if we cannot impress upon the minds of our sons going into the world the importance of living as much as possible in the homes of the people. That they may teach them the truth and confer blessings on those who entertain them.  
  
It is a pleasure to mingle with the elders who have filled successful missions, who have returned from the nations of the earth in honor. They bring with them a spirit of happiness and satisfaction. They come home feeling that they have done well, and they know, if they have done their duty, that the Lord is pleased with them, and with the efforts they have put forth to bless their fellows.  
  
From time to time we are arrayed against each other in political campaigns. I don't know another people more intense than we are during such periods, and I regret that men are sometimes led to say and do things that are unworthy of a Latter-day Saint. The great political parties are necessary. It is important that our liberties be preserved, and all should be interested, and it seems to me that we can be consistent Church members and take part in politics, while we accord to others the privileges we claim for ourselves. We should be deeply concerned in the welfare of the nation, and sustain good and great men. as the Lord has commanded us, in order that we may continue to enjoy freedom. Some of our brethren have become so wrapped up in their political ambitions that they place them in advance of their faith in God. Quite recently, one man was heard to remark that he could not believe in a church which taught that the constitution of the United States was inspired of God, yet we believe it was inspired. This, of course, is an extreme case, yet is an indication of what we might be tempted to say. I would like to admonish you not to let your political ambitions lead up to make remarks that would wound your fellows, and draw you away from the Church. Whenever your politics cause you to speak unkindly of your brethren, know this, that you are upon dangerous ground. Remember that, after the great political nations of this world have crumbled and fallen to decay, the Church of Jesus Christ, with which you are identified, will be in existence, and the Master Himself will continue to be its head. Let us not become so worked up in our feelings that we shut our eyes to the greater blessings, to the most important thing, the salvation of our souls. Let us not ally ourselves with bodies of men who would tear down and break in pieces this government, that was founded under the inspiration of God the Eternal Father. We cannot belong to any political party that is opposed to this free government and be consistent Latter-day Saints.  
  
I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the unity that exists among you. I am gratified as I travel from place to place to find in the homes of our people the spirit of love and kindness. They are attending to their daily prayers. Their children are being taught to pray, and ask a blessing upon the food. Fathers and mothers are teaching their children to honor God and to keep His commandments. All these things give me joy, and I am thankful for the peace that I find in such homes.  
  
In our homes, brethren and sisters, it is our privilege, nay, it is our duty, to call our families together to be taught the truths of the Holy Scriptures. In every home, children should be encouraged to read the word of the Lord, as it has been revealed to us in all dispensations. We should read the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price; not only read it in our homes, but explain it to our children, that they may understand the hand dealings of God with the peoples of the earth. Let us see if we cannot do more of this in the future than we have done in the past. Let each one in this congregation today ask himself: "Have I done my duty in my home in reading and in teaching the Gospel, as it has been revealed through the prophets of the Lord?" If we have not let us repent of our neglect and draw our families around us and teach them the truth.  
  
I would like to suggest that some of these older men, who have raised their own families, may, with profit, go into the homes of their sons and daughters and, by right of their fatherhood, call those families together and teach them the things that are necessary for them to know. On every hand we can find opportunity for the use of the talents our Father has blessed us with. Let us do individual work with our brethren and sisters. If we find a man or a woman who has not succeeded in life, one who is weakening in his faith, let us not turn our backs upon him; let us make it a point to visit him, and go to him in kindness and love, and encourage him to turn from the error of his way. The opportunity to do individual work among us as a people is present everywhere; and there are few men and few women in this Church who could not, if they would, reach out a little farther from the circle with which they are identified, and say a kind word, or teach the truth to some of our Father's children who are not being reached by the organizations of the Church, because we are unable to gather them in. This is our Father's work. It is the most important thing that we will be identified with in this life. All that we do to build it up will be profitable to us. Every kind act that we perform for one of our Father's children is but a permanent investment made by us that will bear eternal dividends. We spend our time seeking the riches of this life, and on every hand opportunities are being nelgected that would lay up for us treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not corrupt nor thieves break in and steal. The Lord will not hold President Smith responsible for the conduct of this great Church, only so far as he is required to perform his duties in it, but you and I, each and everyone, are responsible to the Father of us all for the time we expend in this life, and for the efforts that we make in one direction or another. It is just as important that those of us, who may feel that we are down in the ranks, should be fasting and praying and working for the salvation of the souls of men, as that those who are presiding over us should. It is just as important for you and for me to let our light so shine that others, seeing our good works, may glorify our Father in heaven, as that those who have been called to preside over us in the Church should do so. I am afraid some of us expect others to spend all their lives in the interest of the Church, many times to the neglect of their own families, in order that this work may continue on to the successful fruition; but forget that we ought to do as much as they if we expect the blessing.  
  
Now let us examine ourselves. Are we doing as much as we should? And if we are not, let us turn around and do better. If we are doing as we should, if we are reaching out in all directions to do good to the children of our Father, then we will bring to ourselves the blessing of an all wise Father, and we will rejoice in the good that we accomplish here. When we go to the other side of the veil, we will receive there the thanks and gratitude of those for whom we have labored in this life. Let us be humble and prayerful, living near to our Heavenly Father, and evidence our belief in the Gospel of Jesus Christ by living up to its principles. Let us evidence our faith in God, and in the work He has given to the earth, by a correct and consistent life, for after all that is the strongest testimony that we will be able to bear of the truth of this work.  
  
I am grateful for the companionship that I have with my brethren and sisters in the Church. I am grateful that I have been considered worthy to have a name in this great organization of our Father, and thank you one and all for all the comfort that you have given me in the times that are past, when we have had the privilege of meeting in your homes in the stakes of Zion, I appreciate your consideration and kindness to me, and to the brethren who come to you, from time to time, from the headquarters of the Church.  
  
May the Lord add His blessings; may His peace be upon us; may the spirit of kindness, of love, and of charity which we possess lead us to our neighbors who are not of our faith. May the disposition that we manifest to honor all men, and accord to them their liberties inspire in the hearts of some of those who are not of us a desire to do the same. May the testimony that we bear, that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ and the Redeemer of the world, find lodgement in the breasts of those who do not understand it, and, by reason of that testimony, may they be brought to a knowledge of the truth. May this great work of our Father, in these last days, continue to roll on, not to do any man harm but to uplift every soul with which it comes in contact. May it continue to spread abroad in the earth for the lifting up and encouragement of all our Father's children, and for the alleviation of their distress of mind, and the conditions they bring upon themselves by disobedience to the laws of our God.  
  
May His peace be upon all Israel. May His peace be upon the land in which we live. May He bless those who stand at the head of this government, that they may be inspired to labor for the good and the welfare of all the people who dwell here. May the influence of this nation be for the liberty and enlightment of all the nations of the earth; may they see in this great republic, the organization which was inspired by our Father, that righteousness will lead them to better lives, and that will bring to them the opportunity to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, that thereby, they may be able to return into His presence.  
  
May His peace be upon you all, and His blessing upon all Israel, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

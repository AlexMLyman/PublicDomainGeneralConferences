My brethren and sisters: I rejoice in the blessings of this conference. I thank the Lord that now that we are about to conclude its meetings, another chapter in the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been written, gone into history. We can never live the past six months over again. Our works, individual, and collectively, as individuals and a Church have been performed, and we now begin a new era. Six months hence we shall meet together again; I pray the Lord that when that time comes it may be said, as it has been truthfully said, now, that we have continued on the road of progression in which the Church has been traveling from the day of its inception in 1830, until now. So, my brethren and sisters, may the work of the Lord grow. May it continue to spread. May the voice of the elders of Israel be heard in every land and clime, bearing witness of the divinity of the mission of the Prophet Joseph, and the restoration of the Gospel in this dispensation for the redemption of the covenant people of the Lord. May the blessing of the Lord go with you to your homes, be with you in your avocations; may it be with your families and all that pertains to you, I pray through Jesus Christ. Amen.

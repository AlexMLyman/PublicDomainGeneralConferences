(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

We are very glad to see such a manifestation of anxiety to hear the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ expounded. While the weather is not very propitious, we trust that in our souls we may be fed with the bread of life, and that we may rejoice in the things pertaining to the kingdom of God that may be brought to our attention.

VOTE ON THE PURCHASE OF LIBERTY BONDS. 

The Latter-day Saints are well aware of the fact that the Church has appropriated, on account of liberty bonds, a sum aggregating more than half a million of dollars. I feel to propose that we again appropriate the sum of $250,000 for the purchase of bonds of the Fourth Liberty Loan. The motion is seconded. I sincerely regret that the financial condition of the Church — on account of the great demands upon it for funds for the support of our educational institutions, and for the accomplishment of our building operations that are in hand — is such that we cannot offer more at this time. This is a matter that is beyond the immediate reach of the council of the Church, appointed by the authority of God, by revelation, to use the funds of the Church, and therefore I submit it to this great conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All who are in favor of this move will please signify it by raising the right hand. (Unanimous response.) Contrary minded, if there are any, by the same sign. (No response.) I see no contrary votes.

(Of the Presiding Bishopric.)  

President Smith wishes me to say that Elder George F. Richards continues in charge of the European Mission.  
  
We have now in the service of the army and navy of the United States nearly fifteen thousand of our young men. We have in France Elders B. H. Roberts, Calvin S. Smith, and Herbert Maw, acting as chaplains. According to the ruling of the government, we should be entitled to the appointment of others. Recommendations have been made, and we hope assignments will follow soon.

I am sure that I speak your feelings when I say to the LeGrand ward choir, and the excellent musicians who have accompanied them, that we have enjoyed their splendid music this day. We thank them, also those who have sung to us in the selections intervening, for the very excellent renditions with which they have favored us.  
  
I am also very sure that we have greatly enjoyed the excellent and inspired words that have been spoken by the brethren who have addressed us.

While I am on my feet, my brethren and sisters, I desire to call attention to the fact that, at the coming election, which will soon be held in this state, there will be presented to you for your vote, either for or against, an amendment to the constitution of the State of Utah providing for perpetual prohibition in this state. We already have laws prohibiting the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors in the state, which were enacted by the last legislature. There was also passed by the last legislature a resolution which is to be referred to the people amending the constitution of the State, so that prohibition will become perpetual unless the state constitution shall be again amended.  
  
I do not think it necessary to enter into any argument at all to convince you of the action that ought to be taken by Latter-day Saints on this measure. We are only just now beginning to appreciate the benefits that have come to us through the abolition of this obnoxious business, and we trust and expect, in order that we may be in harmony with this nation, with its executive who calls our attention to the fact that the use of intoxicating liquors ought to be and must be prohibited in the nation, and the fact that all civilized nations in the world which have engaged in the great struggle that is now on, so far as I am able to learn, have placed themselves on record in opposition to the use of intoxicants. And so we want you to carefully consider this question, to think of it, and if you want a dry state to vote for that amendment to the constitution.  
  
May the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and his Spirit be with you while we shall continue the service this afternoon, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

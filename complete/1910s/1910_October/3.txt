The Saints should emulate President Joseph F. Smith's example of faithfulness. — Satisfaction found in the proclamation of the Gospel. — Cheerful responses to calls for missionaries. — Folly of wandering in search of better locations. — Loyalty to the flag, land, and laws of the country enjoined. — Moral training of children an important duty. — Teachings of the Mormon Priesthood always inculcate virtue, honesty, and all righteous principles.  
  
I have very great pleasure in welcoming you, one and all, to this conference, and endorsing with all my heart the good words that have been spoken by President Smith and President Lund in their addresses before you this morning. I am grateful, indeed, for the blessings of the Almighty, which we have received as a people. I am grateful to our countrymen for the kindly consideration they have given us, and the fairness with which they have treated us in the years that are passed and gone. I recognize, fully, that there has been much misunderstanding in the breasts of many people in regard to our purpose and mission in the world.  
  
President Smith stated to us, very clearly and explicitly, this morning, his belief in the gospel of the Redeemer, in the mission of the Latter-day Prophet, in the moral principles and doctrines essential to the well-being of mankind; and told of his efforts, at all times and in all places, to fulfill his obligations in honor to his God, to his country, and to his fellow-men. The spirit of his talk to us should make its impress upon the minds of every young man and young woman in this community. His determination to serve God, to keep His commandments, to be just and fair to all men, to love the truth, to betray no trust, but to fulfill all obligations in honor, should commend itself to every right-thinking man and woman within the confines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to the hearts and good feeling of every citizen of the United States.  
  
My brothers and my sisters, I trust that each one of us, as we shall look into our own consciences, weigh our own conduct, look about us and consider the experiences of our lives, shall be enabled to say the same of ourselves. When we shall have reached the age at which he has arrived, and when we have gone through varied experiences similar to those through which he has passed, I trust that our consciences shall say to us, as we stand in the presence of our fellow-men: I have betrayed no trust, violated no obligation, nor counseled other men so to do.  
  
President Lund has presented to us the conditions that exist in some parts of the world, in connection with the Gospel, the success of the elders in their ministry, the results that are coming from their sacrifices and their labors. For it is a sacrifice to leave home and friends, to go forth a stranger in a strange land, without means, to make your way among your fellows and declare your faith. It is all the more difficult when many of your fellowmen look upon you simply in the light of a deceiver, whose mission is to mislead, and whose heart is aflame with the purpose of doing wrong to his fellows. But the approval of a man's own conscience is his richest earthly reward, and he is blest in the fulfillment of the obligation of scattering the seeds of the gospel of the Redeemer among the children of men. No man or woman can be engaged in a more pleasing and satisfactory duty, no matter what may be the character of the abuse they may receive, or the wrongs and outrages that may be perpetrated against them. This mission of ours is to all the world. When we received this gospel, going into the waters of baptism and making our covenants with God, we took upon ourselves this responsibility to preach the gospel to every creature, every nation, every kindred, every tongue, and every people. Every man. and every woman who received that gospel in a foreign land made the same covenant, and bore record that it was sent of God, that the angel had flown through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach. When we become conversant with its principles we learn to revere the name of the Supreme Being, we recognize the sacredness of the mission of the Redeemer of the world and the offering He made in our interest. When we became pricked in our hearts, and the voice of the spirit had declared to us that this is, indeed, the gospel of the Redeemer, and that He is, indeed, the Savior of the world, we entered the waters of baptism, in harmony with that call: "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." We entered into the obligation, that, to the best of our ability, we would make it possible for every human being throughout the earth to hear the same glad sound which had pricked our hearts and which had aroused us from the conditions that surrounded us. When the gospel message appeared, finding us, sometimes, in the midst of sin and evil, when the word was declared in our ears that the angel of God had come, that the truth in its fullness and purity was among men, we turned from evil practices; entered the watery grave; we received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and in receiving that gift, we said to our God: Our time, our talents shall be devoted to the accomplishment of this work, calling the children of men to repentance, and pointing out to them the way of life. It is upon this mission, in the discharge of this sacred obligation, that over two thousand of our elders — many of them boys, so to speak — are to be found among the nations of this world, upon the islands of the sea, in the far east and the far west, in the north and in the south, carrying that herald, making that proclamation. Having accomplished their great mission, they are standing free, before their Maker, from the blood and sins of the children of this world.  
  
There should never be an abatement in the hearts and souls of the Latter-day Saints, in their desire for the full accomplishment of this wonderful work; and how pleasing it is to note their response. Day after day, as we open the letters of the young elders in our mountain home, to whom has been addressed the reminder that laborers are needed in the field, to aid in the accomplishment of the work we have to do, in nine cases out of ten comes the speedy answer: "I am ready to go, at the time appointed, to any part of the world, to fulfill my part in the accomplishment of that work of spreading truth." There are, occasionally, those who cannot at the present moment respond; but where such is the case they say, "A year from now, when my business concerns are in shape, so that I can go in honor, I will meet that call, for I hold it among the most sacred of duties." What a word to come from an army of "Mormon" boys all over the land. While I say this in regard to the boys, the maidens also that are wanted to assist in this missionary labor, among the nations, make the same response, in the same heroic manner, and with the same abiding faith. My brothers and sisters, I trust that that impress will grow upon our minds, that this work is to be accomplished in every land and in every clime; for it was to be preached to every nation. Remember that. It was to be preached to every kindred; it was to be preached to every nation; and the call: "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues," was to be the cry among the children of men.  
  
There are a number of subjects upon which, probably, we ought to speak in this conference, and in which we are most earnestly and devotedly interested. Among them is the one in which we see evidence of the drifting away from the old habit in the formation of our settlements and establishing ourselves in the land. There is discovered to be uneasiness in some sections of the country. There are still quite a number of our brethren wandering around in the world, hunting something better beyond our settlements. They have been in most states of the Union. They have passed beyond the borders into Mexico. Some of them have gone down into the South American republics. Others of them have passed beyond the borders into Canada. They are seen on the move, looking for something and anticipating something which never comes. After wandering around the circle, dissipating their means, and putting themselves almost in a condition of beggary, they in many instances are compelled to return to their mountain home, that they may be enabled to secure the necessaries of life. We have sought to stop this tendency and to call the people to an understanding of their responsibility in caring, legitimately and properly, for their households, in making their homes and preserving those homes, that their children may not be wanderers in the world. But, it seems difficult to make an impression upon some minds in regard to this matter, and we feel that an effort should be made to preserve ourselves in the possession of that which we have, and to repress this spirit of wandering, wandering, and wandering, until it leads to our almost complete annihilation, so far as our happiness is concerned, and almost as far as our physical wellbeing is concerned.  
  
The United States, my friends, is good enough for me. Anywhere under that flag, within the confines of the United States, should please every American, should fill him with hope and with faith, and none of you can help but feel that hope and that faith when you stop to think and weigh the mission of that flag in the world, and the good that has come to you and yours, and the good that has come to me and mine. From a far-off land, amidst persecution and trial, my ancestry landed upon this continent. Under our flag they have endured some hardships and some privations and tribulations. Even wrongs have been heaped upon them by the intolerance of their fellow-men; but we have yet to find one of them who feels that that flag should be lowered from the place it occupies. They feel that our country's laws should be sustained and honored by the children of the Latter-day Saints in the United States. Our place among men should be a place of honor, a place of worth, that no matter where found we should be recognized as among the most obedient, tractable, and earnest observers of the laws of our country. In our perversions and the mistakes we make in life, we should not lay it to the flag; we should not lay it to the laws of our country. We should not lay it to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which under the law of God is required to obey every constitutional law of this land. When we step aside from it, we assume personally the burdens and responsibilities of our violations of the law. May you and I recognize our place in the great scheme of life to which we have been called by the still small voice, or by the ministration of the elders of the Church in the world outside. May we continue beneath the folds of the flag, in this glorious land, rejoicing in the fact that it floats and invites us to enjoy every blessing and right that mortal can enjoy beneath any flag in the world — and many more.  
  
I do not wish to drift away from the thought that is in my mind upon this question of people moving from our sections of the country into other sections of the land. To the east of us is one of the finest sections of the world, a place where good homes can be built, where ample water, by labor, can be secured, and where industrious men, in the course of a few years, can stand in the possession of opulence and wealth. There homes may be established, and joy abound in the rearing of a family among friends and neighbors who feel, as you feel, reverence and respect for everything that is noble and good.  
  
The impress of the remarks of President Lund, in regard to the question of the guardianship of our children, should ever be held in remembrance by Latter-day Saints. Their homes should be homes of love and peace, should be homes of plenty, should be homes of prayer and devotion. They should be homes where a father, loving the right, presides in honor, and where a mother loving the right, loving the home and all its interests, guards it and her children. There is quite a deal of carelessness and thoughtlessness in regard to the matter of the mingling together of all classes of people, especially of young people, that forebodes evil of no limited character. We should seek to change and limit that wrong, and the possibilities of that wrong. Your sons, in paying their addresses to my daughters should pay to them the addresses of a man that is clean, and moral, and sweet in his life. The girls who receive and enjoy his companionship should recognize his worth as a man of honor, of integrity, and of virtue. The woman to whom he pays his addresses should be above reproach, or the possibility of censure in any respect as to their moral worth. When my sons go into your homes, to pay their addresses to your daughters, you should expect them to be men who are above reproach, whose honor is clean and free, who are as virtuous as maiden could be. Their hearts should be aflame with the true nobility of manhood, a love of God, love of country, love of home, love of faith, love of right, and be possessed of the dignity that should characterize genuine and true manhood in every sense of the word.  
  
My brethren and sisters, let us remember who we are; let us remember from whence we came. Let us remember our hope in connection with this work which God has revealed, the hope in our souls, written there by the finger of God. Let us keep in mind the obligations resting upon us, that we would stand for the uplifting of the race, that we would guard manhood, and require from manhood the same that has been required by the world from womanhood! We shall continue to require from the womanhood of our Church, the womanhood of our nation, a womanhood so clean and so sweet that, wherever found, the impress of the nobility of their character will write upon the souls of men — respect, honor, and devotion.  
  
Again, I welcome you to conference. Again, I say to you, when you go to your homes, go with this impress upon your souls, that the Latter-day Saints love this government, that the Latter-day Saints love every truth that God has revealed, that the Latter-day Saints propose to continue to gather truth from every source in the world, and to utilize that truth, to the best of their ability, in the betterment of the human family, men, women, and children alike. Let us keep up the standard of our birth, as far as it is possible for us to do, and let us teach the women who are forfeiting their right of motherhood, and trampling in the dust that call of God, "Multiply and replenish the earth," that they are on the road to destruction; that it means death; it means shame; it means the blotting out of the purposes of God, so far as their acts are concerned. Let us say to our own womanhood, one and all: Motherhood is her glory, and the fulfillment of the position of motherhood places her, when her mission is done, in the arms and holding the respect of the Redeemer of the world and God our Father, the friend and guide of us all.  
  
Look carefully around, over the land; secure good homes; preserve everything of a temporal nature, and utilize it legitimately. Cease to grow in the thought of increasing extravagance and recklessness. There is a feeling of recklessness taking possession of American people — and it reaches us — that will, from time to time, write the dishonor of the men, all over the land, who are unfaithfully handling the funds of other people. Wherever a man is entrusted with the funds of a people, or of his neighbors or friends, as a banker, as a merchant, or in any of the fields of activity, where we enter to do legitimate and proper business, he should learn that those interests should be guarded more carefully and sacredly than his life. But, we hear and see, upon the right hand and upon the left: This man has gone wrong, and the other man has gone wrong. This one has made a mistake. This one is in the penitentiary, in connection with these matters, and as a result of these conditions has brought himself into disgrace and shame. He has disgraced the family from which he came; he has disgraced the wife and child with whom he was associated, if he had a wife and child, and disgraced, as far as it is possible, the honor of his state and the honor of his nation. You among the Mormon people can write it in your books, that the Mormon apostles have never counseled you to steal. They have never counseled you to lie. They have never counseled you to bear false witness against your neighbor. They have never counseled you to do a wrong to your fellow; not in any sense of the word. But their instruction, from the day you were born, as you have heard their voices in these gatherings, or in other gatherings, was that the highest elements of your manhood should be developed, that you might be lifted up and prepared for the duties of life. Pay your debts, be honest, virtuous, truthful, generous, brave, with unyielding courage and eternal hope; and God, the Father, will receive you when your mission in the world is done. They have warned you not to destroy the honor of woman. They have sought to guard you in the complete and implicit observance of every moral rule. Every woman has been warned and rewarned by the same voices, See to it that your womanhood is guarded, and that you live in harmony with the principles of righteousness and right.  
  
Now, my brethren and sisters, I welcome you, again, and ask you to observe the rules of your Church, and you will never be far in the wrong. Observe the duties and responsibilities made incumbent upon you and which come to you by right under the constitution and laws of your country, and you will never go far wrong. It is true we have our weaknesses, and we make our little mistakes; but the heavy burdens of crime and evil will not rest upon our shoulders. When the time shall come, we will stand accepted of our God, because we have been true to Him; we have been true to one another; we have been true to the obligations into which we have entered. We have been true to the requirement given of the Lord, and with which we have had much to do and say in the times past, obeying the laws of our country, which have been decided constitutional by the courts of our country, and doing that, there will be no regrets upon our part. None of our friends will feel that we have trampled upon them, if we have walked in this right and true path.  
  
May heaven bless every man, woman, and child of our land. May the Lord bless the citizenship of our state, men of every creed and of every faith, if they obey the requirements of that faith in honor and in truth. May He bless the sons of the soil of the United States, and her daughters, that this land may present a people to the world, that shall be unequalled among mankind in the future; men and women who shall be unequalled in their equipment for the duties of life, unequalled in their generosity, in their bravery, in their love of virtue, in their honor of truth, and in their sustaining of all things that mean, in manhood and womanhood, all that is noble and good. Amen.

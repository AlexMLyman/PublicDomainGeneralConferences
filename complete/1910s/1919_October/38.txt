Elder Joseph Fielding Smith informs me that I made a mistake, he thinks, in announcing that his father's favorite hymn was, "Uphold the Right." He believes his father's favorite hymn was, "I know that my Redeemer lives." As I read the other favorite, hymn, I will read this one.  
  
I know that my Redeemer lives;  
 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives!  
 
He lives, He lives, who once was dead,  
 
He lives, my ever-living head.  
  
He lives to bless me with his love,  
 
He lives to plead for me above,  
 
He lives, my hungry soul to feed,  
 
He lives to bless in time of need.  
  
He lives to grant me rich supply,  
 
He lives to guide me with His eye,  
 
He lives to comfort me when faint,  
 
He lives to hear my soul's complaint.  
  
He lives to silence all my fears,  
  
He lives to wipe away my tears,  
  
He lives to calm my troubled heart,  
  
He lives, all blessings to impart,  
  
He lives, my kind, wise, heavenly friend,  
 
He lives and loves me to the end,  
 
He lives, and while he lives I'll sing,  
 
He lives, my Prophet, Priest and King.  
  
He lives, and grants me daily breath,  
 
He lives, and I shall conquer death,  
 
He lives, my mansion to prepare,  
 
He lives to bring me safely there.  
  
He lives, all glory to His name!  
 
He lives, my Savior, still the same;  
 
O, the sweet joy this sentence gives,  
 
"I know that my Redeemer lives!"  
  
You will note that I have changed one word in the second line of the last verse. I remember that whenever we sang this hymn in the Temple, President Smith insisted on reading that line as I have given it, "He lives, my Savior, still the same." I believe that I am safe in saying that no man who has ever stood at the head of the Church, within the recollection of us who were born in this valley, ever thrilled the hearts of the people in testifying that his Redeemer lived, as did our late beloved President Joseph F. Smith.

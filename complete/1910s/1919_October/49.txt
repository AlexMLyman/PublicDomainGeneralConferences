We would have been very much pleased, indeed, to have heard from one or two more, but time will not permit. I wish to say that each and all of the general authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, without any reservations whatever, have my unbounded love and confidence. They have sustained me with their faith and their prayers, and have fulfilled every request that I have made of them. I wish to say that there is not a stake president in all the Church who does not have my love and confidence. The Latter-day Saints throughout the Church have sustained me beyond anything that I could have expected or believed possible. I pray God to sanctify all that has been said and done in this conference to the good of the Latter-day Saints. I pray for the welfare of mankind, at home and abroad. I bear to you my testimony that God has spoken again from the heavens, that we have the gospel of life and salvation; and I pray God to help us to live it, all of which I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

HAVE you ever stopped to think how much time we spend in planning what we shall put on and what we shall put in our children's bodies and how little in planning what we shall put in their minds? They go to school, to be sure, but that is for only five hours a day for approximately 185 days a year. What of the years before they begin to go to school, what of the hours and days each year in which they are not under instruction? Have we any deliberate plans to care for the mind's growth as we care for the body's?  
  
It is just as important that children shall read good books as it is that they shall learn to read at all. It would be hard to find any one who would declare that it is unnecessary for children to learn to read. Yet reading in itself is not the end we seek, but only a means to the end. The goal of all education is the enrichment of life, and a child's reading carefully guided will deepen and strengthen his future ability to make the most of himself and his opportunities.  
  
To really love books so that they may be woven into the warp and woof of his life a child should have his own individual library, which grows year by year with his growth, yet which contains friends to whom he will return time and time again, secure in the knowledge of a happy companionship, full of pleasant associations. A large number of books is not essential to have, but a few should be added each year and the standard of choice should be kept high. — Seattle Public Library Bulletin.

 Read the Church Works  
  
Every Latter-day Saint family should possess a complete set of the Church Works. They are full of inspired teachings and bring an influence in the home that is wholesome and uplifting. Familiarity with these inspired books means intelligent membership and a spiritual equipment for big, wholesome service.  
  
Let your children make the acquaintance of these sacred volumes by frequent contact with them in the home. There is no more impressive and effective way to impress them with the truths of the gospel.  
  
The Doctrine and Covenants — A wonderful book of modern revelations. The word of the Lord to the people of this dispensation. No home library is complete without it.  
  
The Book of Mormon — A history unique. A gripping story that has the distinction of being true. A compendium of divine truth.  
  
The Pearl of Great Price — A volume of pleasant and profitable reading. It's all that its title implies.  
  
The History of the Church — By any one of three or four trenchant writers. A history full of romance, heroism and achievement.  
  
You need the Church Works in your home. We can supply you with any or all of them, in a variety of bindings, and prices to meet your convenience.

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters: If I could do so, without being misunderstood, I would be very happy and more than pleased to yield my time to my brethren who are to follow. That, however, would be misconstrued; and so, responding to the wish of President Grant, who is conducting this conference I am sure, by the inspiration of the Lord that is in him, I desire to say, and am thankful for the opportunity of saying it, that I believe in God the Eternal Father, as the creating and sustaining power of the universe. I believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer of men. I believe in the Holy Ghost as the witness of the existence, and power, and majesty and might of the Father; and the witness also to the redeeming power of the Christ. I believe that these Three constitute the one Godhead of our universe, and that there proceeds forth from their presence the spirit that carries the power and attributes of God — wisdom, holiness, majesty, justice and mercy — throughout the immensity of space; and that it is possible for men to live and move and have their being in that holy Presence. I believe in the new dispensation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these our own times; that Joseph Smith was a prophet inspired of God to establish — no, re-establish — his Church upon the earth, no more to be thrown down, forever; and as the years multiply upon my head a knowledge of these great truths increase in their emphasis in my soul. "Time but the impression deeper makes, As streams their channels deeper wear." To this I bear witness in your presence, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

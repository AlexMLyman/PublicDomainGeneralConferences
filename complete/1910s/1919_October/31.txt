(President of the Boise Stake of Zion) 

The deliberations and instructions of this conference have been to me a wonderful source of inspiration, and I am very glad to say that under the spirit that has prevailed I am perfectly able, without any reservation whatever, to harmonize all my feelings, all my opinions, and all my beliefs, on all questions that have been presented and discussed, with the instructions that have been given. In the thrilling appeals made by our President, and others of the brethren who have spoken, my mind has repeatedly gone to a certain scripture found in the word of the Lord to the prophet Brigham Young, contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 136:27:  
  
Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward.  
  
To my mind, the crying need of the age is for us to do the very best we can with what we have. No one has a gift, a talent, or a possession, so humble, so insignificant, so unimportant, but what that gift, that talent, that possession, can be made serviceable to the human family, and become a blessing and a help to the one who possesses it. All that we are and all that we have, are the free gifts of God. So by the grace of God we are made his stewards, and given the direction of the affairs of our bodies, as a steward is given the management of an estate. And it is given us to say, mainly, what our eyes shall see, to control to a large extent what our ears shall hear, what our tongues shall speak, what our hands shall do, where our feet shall lead us, and what shall be stored in the brain. I sometimes wonder how we, as the stewards of God, are conducting these precious and sacred affairs that have been committed into our hands. Are we doing the very best we can with what we have, or are we burying our talents, losing sight of our gifts and our blessings, and wishing for things that we do not possess, and cannot get? When the Master calls upon us to give an accounting, can he say to us: "Well done, thou good, and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"? Or will he say: "Thou wicked and slothful servant. . . Take, therefore, the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents"? How many of us, stewards, make the Master welcome when he calls by the presence of his Spirit through the medium of the Holy Ghost, the express representative of Jesus Christ, the Son? How many of us invite him into our home? How many of us make him welcome in all the house? Or do we assign him to what we commonly call the "spare room" or the "guest chamber," where no friend or brother would like to be consigned? Why not invite him into the kitchen or into the living room, where the wife and the children are, by the hearth or the fireplace? There is where he loves to come. There is where he loves to be, and there is where we need him most. Oh, we need the divine, sweet, all-inspiring influence of the Holy Ghost in all the house of our souls, in every room, every day, and in all our affairs. Let us remember that he is a guest, he comes only when invited, and stays only so long as he is made welcome; and when we re-claim for ourselves any appetite, any passion, any desire, he will vacate and give us possession. Such is the mission of the Holy Ghost, that great Spirit emanating as a personage of the Godhead, the third personage of the Holy Trinity, to lead, to guide, to inspire into all truth, and no one can be led into all truth without him.  
  
There is something peculiarly significant in the history of the Jewish people. For something like four thousand years they had looked forward to the coming of the Savior of the world, and when he came, the first thing we read of him is, there was no room for him in the inn at Bethlehem. And I am led, sometimes, to wonder if there would be room for him if he came today. I wonder if he could find a place where he would be made welcome. What nation would receive him as its king? What church would resign to him? What pastor would step down from the pulpit and say, "Take my place; I have only been serving pending the time of your coming?" I fear that the world is not quite prepared yet for the coming of the Son of Man to rule and reign as "King of kings and Lord of lords." I would rather pray, it seems to me as I feel now, that his coming might be delayed, at least until we could purify our hearts, set our own houses in order, and carry forward unto the nations of the earth the sacred mission that has been committed unto us, that more souls may be saved and fewer souls lost before the coming of that "great and dreadful day of the Lord."  
  
We have heard at this conference that there is too much policy among men, and let me add, among churches and among nations, and also say there is too much politics among men and among churches and among nations. We need more of the real and less of the counterfeit. We need men and women — the world need's them — who will arise and stand for what they know to be right at all times and under all circumstances. We find too often that love is counterfeited by lust; prudishness is made to pass for virtue; cleverness for wisdom, apathy for peace, self-congratulation for gratitude. The world needs to be humbled with the thought that all that we have and are we owe in an unpayable debt to God who gave us life. We need among us, even ourselves as Latter-day Saints, more gratitude and larger love, more sympathy for each other and for all human kind. And I fear that other calamities, I fear that other punishments, will come upon the earth; that the Lord will have to speak through the sterner forces of nature, which seem to be his only means in many instances of arousing the feelings and the thoughts and appreciations of people to the condition in which they stand, having closed their ears to the spoken word, their eyes and hearts to the written word of God. We need to stand for honesty for honesty's sake, and forever put into the discard that most misleading aphorism, "Honesty is the best policy." Let no man be honest for policy's sake. Let him be honest for honesty's sake. Let him be virtuous for the sake and love of virtue. Let him pay his tithing not for the hope of reward, but because he loves to contribute his share, out of appreciation of all that he has received, for the onward progress and assistance of God's work in the earth. We need to be honest with ourselves, honest with each other.  
  
A minister once announced to his congregation that he would, on the following Sunday, speak on the subject of "Liars," and directed his congregation to read the seventeenth chapter of Mark. The next Sunday he reminded the congregation of his subject, and asked how many had read the text in the seventeenth chapter of Mark. About two hundred and fifty hands went up. He said, "Just hold your hands right there for a moment; you are the very people that I want to talk to today; there is no seventeenth chapter of Mark."  
  
As stewards of God we must be truly appreciative of the things we receive. One has said that, "Ingratitude is a crime more despicable than revenge which is only returning evil for evil, while ingratitude returns evil for good." You remember that of the ten lepers healed by Christ, only one returned to give thanks. A beautiful legend tells the story of two angels that were sent forth throughout the land, each given a basket, one to gather up requests and the other thanksgivings. The angel of requests came back with her basket running over full. The angel of thanksgivings came back with her basket practically .empty. So it is in life. It seems that all have requests to make, but few of us think to return and give thanks.  
  
I wonder if we sometimes stop to think of our debt of gratitude unto, for instance, our parents; what we owe them, and how we might discharge our obligation unto them. In what kind of coin would you pay father and mother for what they have done for you, brother, sister? What do you owe for the Bible? For the sermon on the mount, as only one inspirational chapter in that Bible? What is your debt of gratitude for the Book of Mormon? For the Doctrine and Covenants? For the Pearl of Great Price? What do you owe the pioneers of this western country? What do you owe the prophet Joseph Smith? What do you owe the inventors, the discoverers, the statesmen, the poets, the philosophers? What do you owe for all the modern conveniences and blessings of the commercial and the industrial world? And how are you going to begin to discharge these obligations, my brother, my sister? The only way we can discharge our obligations to our parents is to live our lives, as sons and daughters, so as to bring credit to the name we bear and make our parents feel, before they die, to thank God that that mother had the privilege of giving birth to that son, and not regret one hour of vigil spent over his cradle, not regret one tear she has ever shed for him, or one hour of labor spent for him; and then for us to go on and fulfil our missions in life and become parents ourselves. Then we can begin to pay the debt we owe father and mother. The only way we can begin to discharge our obligations to the world for all that we have received is to so live that we can make the world better for our having been in it; that every citizen of our acquaintance can point to us with pride as his neighbor; to take upon our shoulders a share of the world's work and be of actual service to our fellowmen; to be clean in body and soul, and see to it that our feet shall never lead into places where we would not want our children to follow.  
  
General Pershing, standing before the assembled houses of Congress on the 18th of last month, upon his triumphant return from France, said, among other things, in giving his report: "The burdens that fell to the lot of our soldiers have been heavy, and the way beset by many obstacles, but faith in the righteousness of our cause and trust in Almighty God have given us courage and inspiration." So I say to you, my brethren and sisters, our burdens may be heavy and our way may be beset by many obstacles, yet faith in the righteousness of our cause, which is the greatest cause under heaven, and trust in Almighty God, who is our Father and our Defender, will give us courage and inspiration, and we, like our great general, will come out victorious in the end, and God will look upon our labors well pleased.  
  
God bless us with courage and faith and love and sympathy and gratitude, that we may be wise stewards and do the very best we can with what we have, I pray in the name of him whose servants we are and in whose vineyard we labor. Amen.

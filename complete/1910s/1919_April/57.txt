In announcing the hymn President Grant said: President Charles W. Penrose wrote this hymn at the time Johnston's army was coming to Utah to destroy the "Mormons." Apparently the army did not make a very good job of it, because we are here. This hymn, by President Penrose, was sung in many places in England, creating considerable enthusiasm. In the London conference alone over $3,000 were raised to pay the return fares of elders who were in England; that they might return to Zion and be among those who were to be "destroyed."  
  
The benediction was pronounced by Elder Seymour B. Young, senior president of the Council of Seventy.  
  
Conference adjourned until October, 1919.  
  
Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing in the Tabernacle. Professor John J. McClellan played the accompaniments, interludes, etc., on the organ as by Edward P. Kimball, and Tracy Y. Cannon.  
  
The stenographic reports of the discourses were taken in the Tabernacle by Elder Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Clyde Rasmussen; and in the Assembly Hall and at the Bureau of Information, by Elder Frederick E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker.  
 
Edward H. Anderson,  
 
Clerk of Conference.

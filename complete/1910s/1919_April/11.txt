This is a splendid sight, especially to us who sit here on this platform, but the spectacle presented by our congregation this morning, if anything, was still grander because of the order of the seating and the kind of persons assembled, particularly on the lower floor of this building.  
  
THE SOLEMN ASSEMBLY.  
  
It was a unique congregation, what we call in this Church a "solemn assembly" of the holy priesthood, the several authorities of the Church being arranged to sit in their proper places, according to their relationship to each other, in this splendid organization which the Lord has established on the earth, and of the spirit and power attending the congregation, and especially the speakers. No such a scene as that we beheld this morning could be seen in any of the congregations of the various churches in the world, Christian, or heathen, or pagan.  
  
It is something peculiar to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and this order of priesthood, as exhibited here this morning in our meeting, is not of man's formation. It is divine and bears the stamp of divinity upon it in its order and in the relationship that exists between these different bodies of the priesthood, all animated by one spirit. Truly we can say, as the apostles of old said: We have one Lord, and one faith and one baptism," and one hope of our calling. "And God hath set in the Church first apostles, secondly prophets, after that helps and governments, and miracles and signs and gifts and blessings and the various authorities, all for the work of the ministry, for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Christ, until we all come in unity of the faith to the knowledge of the Son of God," that we may "grow up unto him who is our living head" in all things. I thank God with all my soul today for this glorious privilege of being present and of being associated with the body of men who by uplifted hand recognized the authorities of the Church and voted, without a dissenting sign or manifestation of any kind, to sustain them, being of one heart and one mind and led by one spirit. This is not the first occasion of the kind in which I have participated.  
  
LEADERS OF THE LATTER-DAY DISPENSATION.  
  
We had a splendid discourse from President Grant in relation to the successive presidents that we have had from the beginning of the Church, from the Prophet Joseph Smith down to the present time. I did not have the joy and pleasure of being personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith, but felt familiar with him because of my association with so many with whom he was acquainted, and who received the priesthood of God under his ordination — under his hands, and also by reading his discourses, accounts of his life and works, and receiving by the power of God a testimony of the fact that he was divinely called to usher in the last dispensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times, in the which as the Lord revealed anciently, he would "gather together in one all things that are in him, both in the heavens and in the earth," and this is that dispensation. And I received when I was a boy, when I first embraced the gospel, a testimony by the power and gift of the Holy Ghost, and by many signs and tokens and manifestations to me, personally, a knowledge of this great fact — that God has opened the heavens in the latter times and once more communicated with man, and that Jesus, who is the Christ, his beloved Son, also has been engaged in this work under his direction, and this Church, which bears his name, is indeed the Church of Christ, composed of Latter-day Saints instead of former-day Saints. This testimony was given to me, as I have stated, through my obedience to the gospel in an early day, and since that time, I thank the Lord I have had the opportunity of laboring in this great cause, the greatest thing on the earth, a divine Church, set up not only by divine authority but by divine persons and the actual participation in and direction of Jesus of Nazareth, who is the Christ, the Son of the living God and the Savior of the world.  
  
I was present when President John Taylor succeeded to the presidency of the Church, after the death of President Brigham Young. I was well acquainted with him, but I was not in Nauvoo when the mantle of the prophet Joseph fell upon him, as we have heard testified of many times; but I became acquainted with brother Brigham until we became very familiar, and I had great joy in knowing that he loved me as well as that I loved him, that we often had an opportunity of holding converse and that he understood me as well as I, measureably at least, understood him, and I know that he was the proper successor and inheritor to the authority that was placed upon the Prophet Joseph, that he was the rightful president of this Church, and that he conducted this Church under the inspiration of the Almighty. And the great works he accomplished are seen, many of them, in the building up of this State now in the American Union. But when Brother John Taylor succeeded to the presidency I was present, when that splendid assembly, the kind of which we had this morning, was established here, and took part in it, and so when his successor was appointed. I was here present when President Wilford Woodruff was called to be the President of the Church and also Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith, our beloved apostle and prophet and president who has recently passed away, and I am thankful in my soul today that I am privileged to be here and take part in the installation of President Heber J. Grant as prophet, seer and revelator, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, his authority extending through all the world. And with all my heart I joined with the brethren this morning in lifting up my right hand in token to the heavens that I accepted these men in their several callings as servants of the Most High, holding the authority of the holy priesthood, which is after the order of the Son of God.  
  
MEN CAN DO LITTLE OF THEMSELVES.  
  
I feel as if I could not attempt to add much to the eulogies pronounced upon these great men whose names have been mentioned to us. President Brigham Young, I regarded as one of the most remarkable men of his time. I was going to say, apart from his calling as the prophet of the Lord, but I do not know that he would have made any great mark in the world but for this calling. For I realize fully the truth of the revelation of God through the Prophet Joseph that the powers of this priesthood, represented here this morning, are "inseparably connected with the powers behind the veil," that alone we are not very mighty; that of ourselves we can do very little; but with those heavenly powers associated with us and we with them, great things have been accomplished and still greater are in progress and will be accomplished. For this is the work of the Lord and it is established in the earth for a direct and divine purpose, and will be accomplished although the means by which it is and will be accomplished may be of themselves not very great or mighty, but the powers behind the veil are with us, not only those great men who performed so wonderful a work before President Grant's coming into the presidency, are with the Lord behind the veil, not only they are with us and thousands of the departed ones who have worked in the ministry, but all the great and the mighty of the ages past are with us, powers of the holy priesthood, held by men of God from the beginning are with us, and in that and the oversight and direction of the Lord Jesus Christ as our living head, we can and will prevail over darkness and error and wickedness and corruption and disorder and confusion, and in the place thereof through this agency will come order and peace and concord and brotherly love and the union and power of mankind when united together by the Holy Spirit from on high. This is being poured out upon those who will obey the principles of the gospel, and the fruits thereof are already being made manifest in the earth, and the time will come when all the predictions of the prophets of old, concerning the establishment of the reign of peace will be fulfilled, but it will come through righteousness, and righteousness through the preaching of the truth, the word of God, by the power of God, in the authority of God.  
  
CONCERNING PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.  
  
I had the pleasure of laboring under the direction of those great men who were talked about this morning, President Taylor, President Woodruff, President Lorenzo Snow, and President Joseph F. Smith. When we had finished our voting we sang the song: "How firm a 'foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith in his excellent word. What more can he say than to you He hath said?" I thought, when President Grant sat down, if I was called upon to speak, as he announced that his counselors would have something to say, and after Brother Lund had finished his excellent remarks, what more could I say than to you these have said. I felt very much as a witness did, when called into court to give testimony on a certain case, and had been preceded by a man who told what he knew and who said: "Your Honor, I says as he says," and that was all he could tell. I was very much in the same condition, but I know that would not suffice, so here this afternoon I take pride and pleasure in adding my testimony to the remarks made here this morning concerning each one of the presidents of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from the time of the Prophet Joseph down to the decease of our beloved Brother Joseph F. Smith. I loved him with all my heart, and I am always glad to know that he loved me.  
  
From the first time we met, we felt as though we were kindred spirits. The first time I met him was about 59 years ago, in Liverpool, and when we struck hands and were introduced to each other our hearts went with our hands, and we have always loved each other from that time to the time that he departed; my love remains and abides in my heart, and I am proud of having been associated with him in the ministry. It was through him, that I was called to the apostleship, and ordained under his hands, and also afterwards to be one of his counselors in the First Presidency. In this, I had opportunities of knowing the kind of a man he was and is. He was one of the grand men of the age. He was great in all things he undertook. He had failings, no doubt, like others had, but they were not very manifest. He was a great man in the ministry. He was, indeed, as was pronounced upon his head this morning, a preacher of righteousness and he was a liver of righteousness. He was exemplary in all his ways, in public and in private, and he had a kind heart as well as a strong mind. In all things that came under his notice and his direction he was strong and mighty, not only spiritually, but in what we call temporal things his judgment was splendid. He was accurate. He was awake and alive to his duties. He loved to perform them faithfully and he did so. I am sure that his labors were acceptable unto God, and when "the books are opened and men are judged out of the things written in the books, according to their works," he will stand in the front rank, and he will shine in the fulness of the celestial glory, with the sons of God who minister before the Most High.  
  
God bless his family, those whom he has left to follow in his footsteps. He had a splendid family, men and women that ought to be honored, and will be in Israel all their days and throughout all their generations. They will be prospered in all things; the Lord will be with them, and the influence of the great man who stands as a patriarch at their head will be upon them.  
  
THE MANTLE OF JOSEPH RESTING UPON HEBER.  
  
I believe in the influence of those who hold the priesthood behind, the veil. The testimony given concerning the falling of the mantle of Joseph the prophet upon Brigham Young, when he became the leader of the Church, has been repeated in these times, and quite recently concerning our late president and the president who has been elected, appointed and sustained today, and I believe that the prophet Joseph will be near to Heber J. Grant when necessary — Joseph F. Smith, I mean. And so in regard to his family. I am satisfied in my own mind, and by my own experience, that the powers on high are with the powers on the earth. Men holding the Holy Priesthood, who have ministered in the flesh and have gone into the world of spirits, and are laboring there in the same great cause as that in-which we are engaged in the flesh, help the brethren in their times of need, and are with them, and stand by them in times that try men's souls. I am assured of this, I say, in my own experience; and this is the power by which we shall prevail over the things of the world. The time will come when the priesthood behind the veil will minister personally in the temples of God to men holding the priesthood in the flesh, revealing matters that are needful to be known concerning the departed that the work being performed for the dead, as well as for the living may go on and be accomplished and perfected properly, and that we may grow up together in Jesus the Christ, who is our living head.  
  
SOME THINGS THAT PRESIDENT SMITH WOULD SAY.  
  
Now, my brethren and sisters, there are two or three things that I think President Joseph F. Smith would talk about, if he were present with us today. One is that great truth concerning Jesus of Nazareth. During the later years of his life, President Smith took great pleasure and joy in bearing his testimony to his certainty of knowledge that Jesus is and was the Christ, that he died for mankind, that through him and by him the worlds were made, under the direction of the great Eternal Father, and that he came on the earth in the meridian of time, and laid down his life, voluntarily, for the sins of mankind, that through faith and repentance and baptism, and obedience to all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, men might be raised from the dead and saved and become perfected in the celestial glory, to inherit the fulness of the blessings pertaining to eternal lives; and that through him and by him all the dead, small and great, will come forth from their tombs and stand upon their feet and be judged according to their works, the good, bad or indifferent, of all races and countries and climes, for he is the Redeemer of the world; and "as in Adam all die," so in Christ shall all be raised from the dead. This was one of the themes on which he dwelt before he departed from us, and especially in later years.  
  
THE CHURCH OF CHRIST THE ONLY CHURCH.  
  
Another truth is that this Church, to which we belong, is the only Church of Christ on the earth. This is not saying anything against the views or opinions of our friends and neighbors, or people afar off, who differ from us in our views, not at all. We are quite willing that they shall go their way, particularly if they will allow us to go ours. Sometimes they have tried to prevent us, but they have not accomplished very much in their efforts, no matter what they have done, but this work has gone on in spite of opposition as it will go on until everything beneath the eternal heavens is subdued unto the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and divinity shall reign on the earth instead of mortality and wickedness and corruption.  
  
This Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a special mission in the world and that mission has come from on high, not from the minds of men, not from the reading of books, not inherited from old creeds, but it is the gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to earth in its fulness, in its purity, in its power, in its authority and its unity with the heavens; and it will prevail. All the different sects and organizations in Christendom and the others that are in heathendom suit pretty well the people who adhere to them. All right. Let them stay by them, if they think they are good enough; but they are not good enough for Latter-day Saints. We want the truth as it is on high, and as it is revealed from on high to the servants of God on the earth; and this organization to which we belong is peculiar to itself.  
  
NO NEED FOR OUTSIDE ORDERS.  
  
That introduces another point that I am sure President Joseph F. Smith, if he were here, would touch upon at this conference, and it is this: That when we are in this Church and members of it, we belong to the body of Christ, and there is no need for us to go outside of it for anything in the world, particularly of a religious character. We have no need to dabble in the things of the world; we have no need to join other organizations that are antagonistic to or out of harmony with this Church. Here is something for the Latter-day Saints to consider at this conference. There is nothing new in what I am saying, but it needs to be impressed upon the minds of our people in every part of the Church, and these men who hold the holy priesthood who have lifted up their hands today to sustain the authorities of this Church should carry with them, when they go home, this spirit and this determination as advice for our people. We will serve the Lord! Let the dying world go to its grave if it will. Let the wicked that are being bound in bundles go to the burning if they do not repent, but as for us, We, with all we are and with all we have, should be in this Church in body and in spirit, in every capacity, and there should be no need and no desire on our part to go outside of the strait and narrow way, the only way which leads to the presence of the Eternal Father and to the gift of eternal life.  
  
Now, this is not saying anything against people who desire to belong, to other societies. If a man is satisfied with any of the Christian sects, if it suits him or suits his wife, that is his concern. Generally speaking it is the wife who does the religion in the outside world. I have conversed with a great many very prominent men, some of them members of Congress, and this is what they say: Oh, I don't care about religion, my wife does all that and I go to Church with her." Well, let people who like that kind of thing keep on liking it and if they do not choose to receive what we have — which is perfection in religion, which is Godlike and comes from God, and leads to God — if they do not like that, why they have the privilege of letting it alone. We would not do anything to compel them, if we had the power, to walk in our way; but that is not the point. If men like to believe in the doctrines and principles and sermons that are preached in the world, all right, but as for us, what should we do? What is the duty of the elders of Israel and of men holding the holy priesthood, and of the members of the Church who have been baptized into the Church? Their duty is to be with Christ, baptized into Christ, having put on Christ, coming unto him, belonging to him, to be part of the body of Christ, which is his Church, and to have no entangling alliances with anything outside. Not to do any injury to anybody else who does not see as we do, not at all; not to find fault with them for taking their own way, but our way should be the way of the Lord.  
  
We have no need of anything else. In the troubles that are coming— for the world is menaced now with troubles and strife and division which will bring misery and sorrow and destruction to many souls — let our place be in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the order of the holy priesthood, and we have no need to join other orders to take away part of our time, part of our influence, and part of our means and to hinder us from devoting ourselves entirely to the work of the Lord. Let me urge this upon the attention of my dear brethren and sisters who are here this afternoon. This is the Lord's work and it is marvelous in our eyes. Brother Lund alluded to the revelation of the Lord in the beginning, before there was any organized church of the Saints: "A great and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men. Therefore, thrust in your sickle and reap." Yes, indeed, a marvelous work and a wonder, just as Isaiah predicted; and one of the signs of it was that the wisdom of the wise would perish and the understanding of the prudent would come to naught; but wisdom and inspiration and knowledge and certainty and power are in the gospel of Jesus Christ, revealed from him and by him and under his direction in the last days. Oh my brethren and sisters, why waste your time, your talents, your means, your influence in following something that will perish and pass away, when you could devote yourselves to a thing that will stand forever? For this Church and kingdom, to which you belong, will abide and continue in .time, in eternity, while endless ages roll along, and you with it will become mightier and more powerful; while the things of this world will pass away and perish, and will not abide in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord our God.  
  
JOSEPH A MIGHTY PREACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.  
  
So I say of our dear president, Brother Joseph F. Smith, to whose grandeur of character and faithfulness in the ministry and power and authority from God I add my humble testimony, if he were here I feel assured that he would touch on these questions in a far better way than I could attempt to do. He was a mighty preacher before the Lord. His words were golden. Many of them are treasured up; others have passed away and will be heard perhaps no more until many ages may come in the future. The time will come when all things will be made manifest and the veil of the covering be taken away and we shall see as we are seen, and know as we are known. Our true character will come up and we will be judged and valued for what we are, not for what men have thought about us. In that time all these great things that are hid shall be revealed, from the beginning to the end of time, down through the great dispensations of the past and brought forth in the greatest dispensation of all, the dispensation of the fullness of times.  
  
Now I add my testimony to the eulogies pronounced this morning so beautifully by our brethren upon the great men who have been with us and who have departed from us. The Lord has proved to us that great as they were, others can come forth to perform his work, when he is with them; that this work does not depend upon any single individual or any little coterie of individuals. It is the Lord's work, and is marvelous in our eyes. We will abide with it and give it our support, do what little we can while we live on the earth, and when we depart we fully expect, without any doubt in our souls, to go over to the great multitude of men and women behind the veil who are engaged in this same work, carrying it to those who sit in darkness in the spirit world, working for Christ and for the salvation of mankind under his direction, fighting under his banner the powers that are evil and preparing the great day when he shall come, and the Saints with him, arid reign over all the earth in mighty power and glory. God help us to do this. God help us to see things as they are, to withdraw our influence from those things that are not of God, center our affections, our thoughts, our means, our influence, our power, and especially the authority of the holy priesthood in this great Church that the Lord has set up, which shall win its widening way until all the generations of men that can be saved in this world and in the world behind the veil, shall be brought out of darkness into light and bow the knee to King Immanuel, and serve God our heavenly Father and acknowledge Jesus the Christ as King and Lord of all. Amen.

Although we have lost our beloved leader, we rejoice that he has left with us an illustrious posterity. We feel grateful that the children of President Smith are following in his footsteps, and I take pleasure in introducing one of his worthy sons, Bishop David A. Smith, of the Presiding Bishopric, who will now address us.

(Of the Council of Seventy, and President of the California Mission.) 
  
I have had some reminiscent thoughts passing through my mind while sitting in the congregation, my brethren and sisters, listening to the splendid words that have been spoken by the presiding authorities of the Church and by the mission presidents who have been called to address these conference meetings. It seems to me but a very brief time since I said farewell to a girl-wife and a little baby and went abroad as a boy missionary. Of course, quite a term of years has passed away since that time, but as I look back it seems a very brief period indeed. I was somewhat impressed today in thinking that, brief as the time appears to me, so far as I know, I am the oldest man with one exception of all the mission presidents in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I am impressed with the thought that time is passing very swiftly. President Joseph F. Smith ofttimes in speaking with reference to the mission presidents spoke of them as "boys." I don't know whether the present presidency of the Church looked upon me as a boy, like the other mission presidents, when they called me to the responsibility that has recently been placed upon my shoulders. I feel in some respects quite a boy, and in other ways not as boyish by any means as I was when I went upon my first mission.  
  
My heart is filled with gratitude today that my Father in heaven, in his wonderful kindness, gave me the privilege, in the days of my boyhood, to go abroad as a representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The experiences gained in the mission field during my first mission, convinced me beyond any question of doubt that I was not upon the errand of man, but that in spite of my lack of experience, and lack of worthiness, I had actually been called of God to preach the gospel of his Son, and that I had been endowed with authority, even the authority of the holy priesthood, and actually had the right to legally call men to repentance, and to administer unto them the precious ordinances of the everlasting gospel. The experiences gained, away back at that period, filled my heart with a joy and gladness that passeth all understanding, just as the Savior promised to those who would take up their cross and follow him.  
  
During the peroid from 1881 to 1896, it was my blessed privilege to be called, upon three separate occasions, to go to the European mission as an elder of the Church. I thank God today for those calls. In all of those missionary labors, I had many very happy experiences, and saw the hand of God in a marvelous manner upon many occasions. I have had a happy life, my brethren and sisters, because of the gospel of the Redeemer of the world. I have not accumulated very much of the good things of the world, but I am thankful to say I have always been quite comfortable. At times, of course, like many others, I could have wished for more of the things of the world, but in spite of this, I say again, I have had a most joyful and happy life, happy in the knowledge that I was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and that this Church is indeed the Church of the living God. This Church is not a church established by the wisdom of men, but a Church established by the revelation and commandment of God. The knowledge of this truth has been with me during these years, and has filled me with very great joy. I expect to be happy in the labors that shall come to me in the California mission.  
  
I realize, as has been intimated by President Grant, that the hearts of the people of California have been wrenched by the release of President Robinson. He has been with the people of the California mission for the long period that has been named. He has been kind and attentive to the people, laboring early and late for their advantage and blessing, and their hearts have gone out to him. I haven't any doubt but what it will be quite a difficult matter for some of the people of the California mission to accept the new president, but I sincerely hope that through the blessing of God, and by the companionship and direction of his Spirit, I also may be led to pursue such a course as shall be for the blessing of the people. I hope I may be able to keep in mind that I am sent to preach the gospel, and that I must call repentance among the people. Responsibility is upon me to bear record to those with whom I come in contact that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God; and that mankind, through his name; and through the ordinances and principles of his gospel, can regain the presence of God. My understanding is that I am under obligation to bear record to the human family, that there is but one gospel. God, himself, so declared at the opening of this great dispensation. He has so taught by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, through the mouths of his apostles in the meridian of time, and all men who have received commissions to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, from my point of understanding, are under obligation to bear record of the truth, and show to men the way of salvation, and invite and persuade men to receive the principles of the everlasting gospel.  
  
I have a very great comfort in my heart today, my brethren and sisters, in the thought that I have the confidence and the blessing of these splendid men who are the leaders of Israel, to whom reference has been made by President Callis, and many others during our conference. I hope that through their help, and through the help of the people generally, and through striving to keep my feet in the straight and narrow path, I may accomplish some good in the preaching of the gospel. I thank God for the gospel. I thank God for the companionship of good men. How my heart has swelled, again and again, in the missionary field; as I have looked into the faces of my missionary companions, I have praised the name of God most fervently that in his providence I was permitted to associate with the class of men who represent the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, abroad in the world, as preachers of righteousness. They have all been good men, clean men, sweet men, men who in their countenances, and by their conduct, have attracted the attention of their fellows who were not of our faith, and they have been able to see that there indeed was something about the "Mormon" elders that was different from the general run of men. I thank God such men have been my companions, and that I have been greatly blessed in their association.  
  
God be praised for the accomplishment of the promises that have been made by holy prophets both ancient and modern in regard to the work of the latter times. It seems to me that any man who desires to know, can know that God has introduced this work, his hand has been over the leaders of this people, and he has sustained them up to the present hour. He has magnified them and he has fulfilled all that any reasonble being could expect of the promises made by holy prophets in relation to the work of latter times. I thank God that there is in my soul a disposition to uphold the authority of God. I love to honor that authority, and am thankful that at this moment I can say in all truth, before God, and this congregation, that my heart, my confidence, and my love go out to President Heber J. Grant today in just as full and complete measure as it went out to his great predecessor, President Joseph F. Smith. For I have in my soul an absolute assurance that God has brought President Grant to the presidency, and that the spirit and power of the great calling that has come to him will be upon him in just as full and rich measure as it has been upon those who have preceded him; it could not be otherwise, because it is the work of God, and God hath wrought this thing. God's blessing, and power, and inspiration, and wisdom, will be manifested today, just as it has been in the past, and so it will continue forever and ever. So hath God said, and he, the scriptures say, shall be true, and his word true, though all men may be liars. God help us to love the truth, to magnify our callings, to keep the commandments of God, to preach the gospel, to win souls from the darkness that is in the world to the truth that has been revealed, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

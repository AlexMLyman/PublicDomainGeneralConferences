We have been listening to truth, so we will ask the congregation to arise and join in singing John Jaques's inspired hymn â€” "O, Say, What is Truth:"  
  
O, say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest gem  
  
That the riches of worlds can produce;  
  
And priceless the value of truth will be when  
  
The proud monarch's costliest diadem Is counted but dross and refuse.  
  
Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize  
 
To which mortals or Gods can aspire:  
  
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,  
 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies, 'Tis an aim for the noblest desire.  
  
The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp,  
 
When with winds of stern justice he copes,  
  
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,  
  
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast, And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.  
  
Then, say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, For the limits of time it steps o'er:  
 
Though the heavens depart, and the earth's fountains burst,  
 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, Eternal, unchanged, evermore.  
  
J. Jaques.  
  
Following the singing of the hymn, President Grant said:  
  
Usually, in our conference proceedings, the hymn is mentioned and the first line recorded, but I would request Brother Edward H. Anderson, our clerk, to see that in publishing the proceedings of this conference, this inspired hymn shall appear in full.  
  
Since our last meeting the vacancy caused by the death of our beloved President has been filled by my being taken from the Council of the Twelve, creating a vacancy in that Council, and Brother Melvin J. Ballard has been sustained by you here, yesterday, to fill the vacancy in the Council of the Twelve. We will now ask Brother Ballard to occupy the balance of the time in this meeting.

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren, sisters, friends, and strangers â€” We bid you all welcome here to our general conference. We hail this as a very auspicious day for the renewal of the gatherings of our annual conference, which was postponed on account of conditions that were very unpropitious during the regularly appointed time, 6th of April, last.  
  
This is the anniversary of the birthday of President Brigham Young, the great pioneer of this western country. Hence I consider this a very proper day for holding our deferred general annual conference. In the large Tabernacle, we have just completed the grand ceremony of sustaining by the votes of the presiding quorums of the priesthood the general authorities of the Church. They were sustained by a rising vote of the quorums of the priesthood, separated and seated in different portions of the tabernacle; then followed the sustaining vote of the entire congregation.  
  
It is suggested that we now give you the same privilege, of rising when you cast your vote sustaining the general authorities of the Church. This is the 89th annual conference of the Church.  
  
It is proposed that we sustain Heber J. Grant as Prophet, Seer and Revelator, and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  
  
All arise, and all who favor this proposition will signify it by raising the right hand. (Unanimous vote.)  
  
The other general authorities of the Church were then presented and sustained in like manner, and as presented in the assembly at the Tabernacle.

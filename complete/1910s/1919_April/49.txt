I will ask Brother Ballard to sing the song that we have heard about this morning:  
  
Brother Ballard then sang: "I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord" 
  
The choir and congregation sang: "Come, let as anew our journey pursue."  
  
Prayer for closing was offered by Elder Edward H. Anderson.

I would like to endorse what was said here by Brother Jensen about his father-in-law. One of the grandest men I have ever known in my life was Jesse N. Smith. He has left one of the largest and most splendid families that I know of in any of the stakes of Zion. It is just such a family as that of President Joseph F. Smith. I have walked more miles and conversed more with Jesse N. Smith than with any other president of a stake of Zion. He was a regular encyclopedia of knowledge. He read Bancroft's History of the Native Races as the volumes came from the press the way I used to read the New York Weekly Ledger, when a boy. Jesse N. Smith I believe was the best read man of all the men with whom I have been acquainted; yet, thank the Lord, he felt, as Brother Jensen has expressed himself, that his reading was of no value to him in comparison to the testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Really I could never quite understand, when I was a young man, and the junior apostle and used to travel hour after hour, walking through the sands of, Arizona with Jesse N. Smith, why in the world the Lord did not choose him for an apostle instead of me. He told me one thing that I endorsed and that was this: he said that from his reading and studying he believed that ''America has produced two wonderfully great and grand statesmen, far above all others, and they both came from Illinois; one was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was Daniel H. Wells. I remember having heard Brigham Young say that Heber C. Kimball was his prophet, and Daniel H. Wells was his statesman.

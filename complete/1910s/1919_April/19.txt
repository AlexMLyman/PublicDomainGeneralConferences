My brethren and sisters, it is not my purpose to detain you. Matters this afternoon come home to me with such force that I feel that I would not dare to undertake to express myself, nor could I do it, I think, if I should try. All that I desire to say is, amen to that which has been spoken by the brethren who have occupied the time.

In harmony with the announcement of President Grant this morning, and in continuation of the spirit of this morning's meeting, the meetings this afternoon will be devoted in further tribute to the memory of our late departed leader, President Joseph F. Smith.  
  
I take pleasure in introducing to you a man whom you all well know, Bishop Charles W. Nibley. Perhaps no man in the Church knew President Smith better, was more intimately acquainted with him, than was our worthy bishop, who will now address us.

After the announcement here, last conference, that we intended to build a temple upon one of the Hawaiian Islands, Sister Ruth May Fox was inspired to write a hymn which was sent over to the Islands, and one of our elders there, Brother Orson Clark, composed music to it, and on the recent visit of Bishop Nibley and myself, we found them singing this beautiful song. We brought a copy of the words and music home with us, and Brother Stephens has prepared it to be sung today. If you will indulge with me for a moment, I will read you the words:  
  
"Sound forth your strains of gladness, ye islands of the sea,  
 
And lift your hearts in praises, O Saints of Hawaii;  
 
The Lord hath heard your pleadings, your long sought day is here  
 
When to the great Jehovah a temple you shall rear.  
  
CHORUS:  
  
"A temple, a temple, in Hawaii! Foreshadowing the glories and splendors yet to be.  
  
"The spirit of Elijah shall permeate its halls,  
 
A choice beloved remnant, within its sacred walls  
 
Receive the promised blessings their father Lehi saw  
 
The Lord would shower upon them when they obey His law.  
  
"Samuel, the Lamanite, forecast this blessed day;  
 
Nephi and Moroni and the faithful passed away  
 
Who lived, believed, and perished on Joseph's glorious land  
 
Unite with you in praises for God's all guiding hand."

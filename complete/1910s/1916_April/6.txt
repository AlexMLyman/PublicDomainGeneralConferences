(President Juarez Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am very grateful this morning for the privilege that I have of attending this conference, and listening to the instructions that come to us from our Heavenly Father, through His servants who preside over us. I am thankful for the privilege of associating with my brethren and sisters, and enjoying the Spirit of the Lord which accompanies us upon our gathering together in our general conferences. I am sure it is a great strength to all of us to have this privilege of associating together, and being encouraged of the Lord in this great latter-day work, in which we are all engaged. Our only desire is to serve the Lord and to accomplish His purposes; and while we desire to do or accomplish the purposes of our Heavenly Father, we need strength from time to time, and a renewal of the Spirit of the Lord in order to enable us to continue the struggle, and the effort that is necessary.  
  
I have anticipated for some time the pleasure of attending this conference, but a few weeks ago I concluded that I would not be enabled to come here, because of the unsettled condition in our part of the Mexican country. Our condition for the last two weeks has been unusually trying. I suppose all of you are aware that the Latter-day Saints in Mexico are located in the heart of the revolutionary section of that country, where revolutions are manufactured. Our condition for a number of years has not been as satisfactory as we should like to have had it, especially since the recognition of General Carranza by this government. It has produced an unusual disturbing and unsettled condition. Our people who reside in Mexico have endeavored to maintain a neutral position, so far as we are concerned. In the beginning of this trouble in Mexico, we were counseled by the brethren who preside over us, that our position should be absolutely neutral; that we should not engage in the conflict that was going on in that country. We have endeavored to maintain this position and to maintain friendly relationship with all the different contending parties that come into our community. While we have been regarded as foreigners, as American citizens or people belonging to the United States, yet there has always been more or less distinction in the minds of the people of Mexico concerning the Latter-day Saints and other Americans who come there for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, engaging in mining and other industries that do not identify them especially with the country.  
  
After the recognition of General Carranza, General Villa returned, and in our locality he kept about twelve thousand of his followers for a period of six weeks, most of them located among our people in Colonia Dublan. They were surprised to find so many American people there, although there really were but a few, and they were surprised to find so much food and substance. They were a hungry lot; they had been whipped and chased over the hills, and when they reached our part of the country they were a famished crowd of people; it did their hearts good to see somebody that could give them something to eat. They paid for what they got in their own kind of money, but of course that was of no value to us, nor to anyone else for that matter, because it had so decreased in value that it was not worth any more than the counterfeit, nevertheless we sold them our produce. We kept that body of men, women, and children in our locality for about six weeks, and fed them corn and other products of the colony. After they had gone we reaped the greatest crops that we have ever harvested in Mexico. This surprised us, and we can not understand it yet. After feeding that great army for that length of time, we had the greatest harvest we have ever reaped, in proportion to the number of people and acreage, since we have been located in Mexico. Our granaries were full, and we had plenty to eat and to wear.  
  
After being defeated in Sonora, a portion of that army returned again to us. They were not in quite as friendly a mood on their return as they were when they went away, but still we managed to get along with them. We treated them kindly; we endeavored to impress upon their minds that we were there for the good of the Mexican people. They destroyed some of our property, but were astonished at being treated kindly after they arrived, and did comparatively little damage, and they passed us by again. A few weeks ago, after the Americans were killed down at the mining camp, General Villa and his company of soldiers passed near our colony again, on his way to Columbus. Friendly Mexicans brought word that he said he was going to destroy Colony Juarez, and kill all the "Mormons;" but he passed us by, and afterward said it entirely slipped his mind, and he had gone so far past that he guessed he would not go back. We were very thankful that he did not, and greatly appreciated the fact that he had passed by without coming to see us.  
  
After the terrible attack on Columbus, and the destruction of property and lives of Americans, and many of their own people who came in contact with them, it caused great concern to those of us in the colonies, especially the natives and Carranza's Mexican soldiers. They were very much concerned because his return brought him again in the direction of the colonies. It is a good, rich, fertile country, and is a good place in which to recruit. It has been a favorite place for the revolutionists, ever since the beginnining of this trouble. They have been able to get more good horses, and good provisions, in that locality than in any other part of Mexico where they have been; consequently, on Villa's return a few weeks ago, after the attack on Columbus, there was considerable anxiety. I want to say this for the Carranza troops at Colonia Dublan, they are not well equipped, and they are not disciplined soldiers, but they had an interest in our people. They did not have a sufficient number to provide any defense for us, but they were careful to keep us posted. No doubt we received a great many reports that were not true, but they sent us all the information they received, and there was not any of it very comforting. The indications were that Villa, with his straggling army and the wounded, were coming back again to the colonies. We were instructed, by the general in charge of the Carranza troops, to move our families into their garrison, and they would take care of us; but, bless your heart, they could not take care of themselves, let alone us. They could not have provided for us and our families; and so we expressed to them our gratitude for their kind invitation, and said that if we should get frightened, and want to leave our homes, we would come. But, we called our brethren and sisters together and appointed a general fast day. We asked all our brethren and sisters to fast, and to pray unto the Lord that we might get an impression concerning what we should do. We were entirely helpless, so far as worldly defense was concerned; guns were very scarce in the colony. I was asked this morning about how many people we had in Colonia Juarez. We had about twenty-five men, and about two hundred fifty women and children. The same questioner wanted to know if we were well armed, and I said no, we did not have any arms; and were thankful to the Lord we did not. We met on the fast day, and while the reports that came to us were not very comforting, and we realized that our brethren and sisters in this country were very much exercised as to our safety and welfare, and as to the wisdom of our remaining in Mexico, yet the unanimous expression of our brethren and sisters in that fast meeting was that the Spirit of the Lord prompted we should remain at home, and serve the Lord and keep His commandments, and put our trust in Him, and He would take care of us whatever the conditions were. We felt that, if General Villa and his army should come to us, the Lord could soften his heart and that he would pass by and leave us with a better feeding of friendship than had existed before. At the conclusion of the meeting, the brethren and sisters returned to their homes, calm and happy, and the night that General Villa passed those colonies the people slept in peace. There was no one on guard, the Carranza soldiers had withdrawn, every man was put into the pits to defend themselves against the approach of General Villa. You may not understand, my brethren and sisters, how that Villa's name strikes terror to the hearts of those people. It is not only Americans that he does not like, when he takes it into his head to destroy life he seems to have no regard to race or color. The Mexicans were very much exercised when they heard that he was only three miles away from our colony, and that it would only be a matter of an hour's time till he could enter it. There was not a person in Colonia Dublan except Latter-day Saints, but we retired to our homes, slept peacefully, and during the night Villa and his guards came into Colony Dublan, within a half a mile of our homes, looked over the town and passed on; he never even disturbed us.  
  
I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, the people of those colonies feel that the Lord has preserved us. He has heard and answered our prayers. President Joseph F. Smith, in the beginning of our return to the colonies, told us that the key to our safety was the spirit of love, the spirit of kindness, the Spirit of the Lord, and the exercise of patience towards the people by whom we were surrounded. If we would manifest this Spirit, and put our trust in the Lord, He would take care of us. It has been a wonderful testimony to the Latter-day Saints and especially to our children, that when we serve the Lord and keep His commandments, and put our trust in Him, He will take care of us. We had no other defense, there was no other possible show for us, and we know that the Lord heard and answered the prayers of the Latter-day Saints concerning His people in that dangerous position in Mexico.  
  
I feel very grateful for the privilege I have had of living in the land of Mexico. I love that people, notwithstanding their degradation. When I realize that they have lived under a curse for many hundreds of years, it is a marvel to me that there is as much good in Mexico and among her people as there is today. They are a child-like people; and if the spirit of kindness, of patience, and of love can be exercised by the American people, toward them, that will do more towards establishing peace in that country than all of the guns and ammunition that can be manufactured. It seems to me — it has always seemed to me — that the mission of the Latter-day Saints in Mexico, in fact, the mission of the Latter-day Saints in all the world, is a mission of peace. We should live peacefully, speak peacefully, and breathe the spirit of peace among all mankind. We are living in a time when the spirit of war is being poured out upon all nations, and it seems to me that the great mission of the Latter-day Saints is to endeavor to establish peace. I know that by dealing with the Mexican people in the spirit of love and kindness, and showing to them true friendliness, you can win their hearts; they are a very approachable people.  
  
The Lord has a work to do in that country. It is not a battle of men; it is not a struggle between men especially, it is a struggle between the power of our Heavenly Father and the powers of darkness that have spread over that country. Darkness has been over the minds of the people, and they are in a degraded and distressing condition. My belief has been that whenever the time shall come that the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall be planted in that land it will be by the faith of men and women who are willing to put their trust in the Lord, men and women who can exhibit a spirit of kindness, a spirit of love and charity, even to those who would do them evil. The instructions of our Lord and Savior is the key-note to the success of the Latter-day Saints, not only in Mexico, but in every other part of the country where we shall go, that is to "do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite fully use you," love our enemies and treat all mankind kindly. It is a mighty hard person who would continually fight against the spirit of kindnesss.  
  
While we have not been, perhaps, as careful as we should have been, while we have not always lived as near to the Lord as we might have clone, yet I believe we stand among the Mexican people today nearer to their hearts than we have even been before. If they were to have their choice they would like to have us continue to remain in their midst. We have gained their friendship and their respect. There has not been a single party, (unless General Felix Diaz has succeeded in starting a new revolution), that has not been into our colonies, and every one of them has left us feeling better than when they came. To be sure, they have robbed us, to some extent, they have taken horses, and saddles, and merchandise, but thank the Lord they have not taken our lives. We have been preserved; the Lord has manifested His Spirit, and the men who have robbed us, who have taken our property, and destroyed much of that which the Lord has blessed us with, have acknowledge that they would rather have their families among the Latter-day Saints than any other place in Mexico. Notwithstanding they have robbed and persecuted us, they realize that their families are safe among the Saints.  
  
My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the work of the Lord. Our living in Mexico is not so much the acquiring and maintaining homes and property, but it has always seemed to me that it was the will of the Lord. I desire to say that I know there is a mighty work to do among that people. If we can only maintain the spirit of kindness, of humanity, of charity, and of patience, the time will come when we will see the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ take hold of that people, when they will be brought into the fold of Christ, and a great and mighty work accomplished.  
  
May the Lord bless us, and help us to establish peace upon the earth, not only in that country but in all the world, including our own country, the United States. We need to live in accord with the spirit of peace, to assist in establishing it in all the world, that we may help our Father bring about the great plan of peace on earth, and prepare for the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May we live worthy, my brethren and sisters to take part in this great latter-day work, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

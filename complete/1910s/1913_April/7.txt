I do not think that President Rich will take any exception to a remark that I would like to make in connection with John's reference to the Lord, or to God being a spirit. I think the fact is that even a man and, a very ordinary man, is a spirit; and if you want any evidence of it, just remove his spirit and look at what remains.

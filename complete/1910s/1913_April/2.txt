Details of Church organization and government, given in the beginning, still unchanged. — Officers established and appointments made as need for them developed. — Magnitude of latter-day work foreseen and provided for at inception. — Importance of keeping historical records. — need for implanting in the children, faith in the Gospel.  
  
I have been much pleased and edified this morning in listening to the President's remarks to us, and I feel happy to have the privilege of meeting with the Latter-day Saints in their general conference. For some time I have not been well enough to attend to my duties in the office of the First Presidency, but I feel thankful that I am so far recovered as to be able to go on and attend to my duties.  
  
When the President was explaining to us where the authority lies in dealing with matters in the Church, I thought how perfect is the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and how perfect it came to us in the very beginning. On Sunday, next, it will be eighty-three years since a few met in the house of Mr. Whitmer in Fayette, New York, and organized the Church. The Lord had commanded them to do this, and the Church was organized in such a way that it has not been necessary to change the organization since then. When we read the revelation on government, which was given about that time, we feel that it is just as suitable today as it was then, and that the authority given to the different quorums, and the duties imposed upon the various members of the priesthood are the same today and they will ever remain the same. We will not at any time feel to discard the Church government given in the twentieth section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. As they were then instructed in regard to their duties so the members of the different quorums are instructed today. The deacons, the teachers and the priests have the same duties laid on them and the same power and authority rests upon the elders, the seventies, the high priests now as then. Though the higher quorums were not yet organized, the Lord had revealed before the organization of the Church that there should be Apostles in the Church, and had even appointed those who should call them, so that if they were not introduced at the very start the revelations were given as to how the Church should be organized. Joseph had informed the little flock that gathered there of what the Lord had commanded, and it was proposed to them that Joseph Smith be the first elder of the Church, and Oliver Cowdery the second. Then Joseph ordained Oliver and Oliver ordained Joseph to the office of an elder. This was not bestowing the Melchisedek Priesthood on either of them. They held that before. It had been conferred upon them by Peter, James and John. It was not given to them by the authority of those present. The Lord had revealed to them, through His servant, and had conferred upon them the Melchisedek Priesthood, but there was no Church organized as yet, and hence there were no officers needed in the Church, but when the Church was organized on April the 6th, 1830, then it was necessary that men should fill official positions in the Church, and do this by the consent of those over whom they were to exercise authority. As yet, the office of a high priest had not been given, but elders had been voted for, and had been ordained, and they took charge of the meeting. What a glorious time they had together that day! They partook of the sacrament for the first time in this dispensation; the emblems of the body and blood of the Savior were administered, and those few who were together rejoiced in having this privilege, and in hearing the testimonies that were borne and the prophecies that were made. Several who were present went away believeing, and were afterwards baptized. On that day when the Church was organized, a revelation was given in which the Lord told Joseph further about the responsible positions he was to fill and the glorious destiny of the church. He says:  
  
Section 21.  
  
1. Behold there shall be a record kept among you, and in it thou shalt he called a Seer, a Translator, a Prophet, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, an Elder of the Church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
2. Being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to build it up unto the most holy faith.  
  
3. Which church was organized and established in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and thirty in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month, which is called April.  
  
4. Wherefore, meaning the Church, thou shall give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;  
  
5. For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith;  
  
6. For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and His name's glory.  
  
7. For thus saith the Lord God. Him have I inspired to move the cause of Zion in mighty power for good, and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have heard.  
  
8. Yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer, for his days of rejoicing are come unto the remission of his sins, and the manifestations of my blessings upon his works."  
  
There are a few more verses belonging to the revelation which I will not take the time to read. This comfprting revelation was given on the 6th of April 1830. The Lord was refering to the Prophet. We can understand Joseph's feelings. He knew that a great and marvelous work was going to be ushered in. He felt how weak he was — a young man, little more than twenty four years old — to have placed upon him the responsibility of introducing this last dispensation and establishing again the Church of Christ upon the earth. No doubt he felt much anxiety, for the Lord said that he had seen his weeping for Zion, but promised that he should be comforted. Joseph did see the work begun, the Church organized, the members sustaining him as their leader, and the offices being filled in the Church. He knew it was the Lord's work, and he rejoiced to see its beginning. The Lord had opened unto him in visions the future of His kindgom, and hence in his talk about the Lord's purposes and the destiny of the Church he spoke the convictions of his soul in which there was not a shade of doubt. It must have seemed wonderful to the people to hear about Zion going to be established, about the gathering, about this being the little stone that should roll down from the mountain and fill the whole earth but with the eve of prophecy he saw it; he knew it would be fulfilled. The Lord in comforting the Saints told them that if they would listen to his counsel, the gates of hell should not have power over them, and this promise is the same to you and to me in as much as we listen to the counsels of inspired men. As I understand that expression "the gates of hell," it means those things which lead to hell in fact are the entrances to it. How many things there are that lead to those gates. How many things we have to be warned against and which we have to watch out for, because if we yield to them, they will lead us to the gates of hell! Let us each and every one examine ourselves and know well the path in which we are walking and avoid everything that we know is wrong and forbidden by the Lord, well knowing that if we yield to such we have not the promise that the gates of hell shall not have power over us; on the other hand if we perform our duty, live according to the testimony which God has given us, we need not fear, for He will lead us in the paths of righteousness that lead to eternal life.  
  
At the beginning of this revelation we were told that there should be a recorder in the Church, that records should be kept among the people. This important work in the Church, of keeping records, was commanded: and if we read farther on we will find that John Whitmer was appointed to be Church Recorder, to write the events of the Church. I mention this to show you how important this part of our Church government is, to keep history, to keep a record of what takes place. I am pleased to say that our activity in this direction has produced good fruits. We have in the Historian's office a great mass of useful data. Many precious things are there, and I am pleased to tell you that before long we hope to erect a new historian's office — one that shall be fire-proof and where we can feel safe in regard to the things that have been treasured up for so many years.  
  
I want to call attention here to a series of articles published in the "American" magazine, from the pen of Brother B. H. Roberts, which gives the Church history, and I believe it would be a splendid thing for the Latter-day Saints to take that magazine, read it and post themselves on Church history. It would especially be a good thing if they had it from the beginning, but I suppose it will some time come out in a history by itself. Even if you have not taken it before, I would advise you to subscribe for it now as Church history can be taken up in any part of it, and still you will find it interesting and well worth reading. I honor those men who have been brave enough to publish these articles, and I am pleased to hear that they are read with interest in the world, but they ought to be read by the Saints at home.  
  
I desire to say to the recorders in the different stakes and in the different wards that your calling is a very important one. In years to come what you write will be looked for and treasured up. We are trying to connect events of Church history in the early days, and when we find in a private day book or record something that connects missing links, why we feel like we have found a treasure. Now, if you children of our pioneers and of the early members of the Church have some of their records or day books, we would like that you would give us an opportunity to read them, and to copy from them such things as may help to corroborate data which we already have, or perhaps give us data that we are not in possession of. We do not ask you to give them to us, but to let us have the use of them till we can make copies of such parts that might be useful to us. Be sure that you keep a record of what takes place in the wards, and in the stakes; the changes in priesthood, and such events that are closely connected with the Church in order that they he not forgotten; and where papers are printed in any of the towns in Zion, we would like you to send a copy of them to the Historian's Office. We will keep them on file. By our having them we may be able to see what is taking place out in the different stakes and wards, that may not reach our larger papers published here. We are seeking to make Church history as perfect as possible, so that when it is referred to reliance can be placed upon what is recorded.  
  
There is another matter I would like to lay before the conference, and that is the necessity of teaching our young. We have splendid Sunday Schols and they are doing a good work We have auxiliary organizations that take up the improvement of the young, and we have religion classes in which we want our children taught faith in the religion of their fathers. In some of the stakes they are doing a splendid work. In others it seems like our brethren who have charge think it an extra burden upon them and do not care to have these classes organized. Let me beg of you, plead with you, to have them established for the good of the children. Let them be taught as the Lord commands us to teach them to walk uprightly before Him. Let us try to give them all the chance in the world to be built up in the faith that is so dear to our hearts. You parents, how much have you not done for the gospel's sake, left everything dear to you and suffered the mockings and scorn of the world? You knew it was God's revealed truth to you, you received it, and you bore these things without murmur and you have gathered with the Saints. Can it be possible that after you have done so much for your God-given faith that you are willing that your children shall be neglected and grow up without having the advantages that you can give them? As you know religion cannot be taught in the state schools we do not want to interfere with the children of our friends of other denominations, but we do want to do all we can for our children and give them an opportunity to learn how precious is the truth which the Lord has given unto us. Encourage the Religion Classes, encourage the children to attend them, encourage the teachers that are willing to go and teach your children, and let us see this auxiliary organization prosper as well as all the others.  
  
Well, I don't think it would be wise for me to continue talking. I am so happy to be with you. I pray the Lord to bless the Latter-day Saints, to bless them with the testimony of the truth, and I bear my testimony to you that this is the work of the Lord, and that it will triumph in the earth. God bless you all. Amen.

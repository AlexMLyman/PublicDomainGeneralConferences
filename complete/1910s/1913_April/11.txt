I have pleasure in saying that the brethren who addressed us yesterday afternoon and this morning so far, are the presidents of the various missions, the Eastern and Southern States, the Northwestern States, the Northern States, and the Central States missions. Brother Herrick, who is the president of the Western States Mission, is absent today attending the funeral of one of his brothers. Brother Rey Pratt, the president of the Spanish Mission, is not present.

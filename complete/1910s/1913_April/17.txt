My beloved brethren and sisters, whether or not I shall be able to rise to the height of this occasion. I feel that the people of my stake are honored in the opportunity that is offered me this afternoon of representing them. I have had great pleasure in the proceedings of the conference thus far. and feel that I have had distinct benefit personally; that in the remarks that have been made there has come to me strength and satisfaction that I have needed, and I would feel well repaid even if at this moment the conference were discontinued. I am looking now into the faces of several thousand people with intellects diversified, no two individuals perhaps thinking along the same lines upon ordinary themes, but assembled with the one purpose in heart, united in one desire to serve the Lord and to keep His commandments, and representing, as I believe, the strength, purpose, and power of latter-day Israel.  
  
I think that if there is any one thing needed to be remembered by the Latter-day Saints it is the injunction contained in a passage that is to be found in the revelations of the Lord, that contains, I believe, more than any other statement of its length, a key to the lives of the Latter-day Saints: "Seek diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another." In my opinion that contains an epitome of wise instruction to the Latter-day Saints. We know with full assurance that it is our duty to seek diligently; that the Lord does not give to him who does not seek; that to every man who seeks, the way shall be open; to him who knocks there will come a ready answer. The lives of Latter-day Saints, the philosophy that they have acquired, or have received, has made them feel that everything they receive is a result of efforts that they put forth. It is important that men should pray always, that hearts should be constantly uplifting to God for His guidance and direction, and that in all we do, we should seek for the inspiration of His Holy Spirit. But, of the three injunctions, I think this to be not the least, that we should be believing. Throughout all the generations of men, as far as my observation goes, I have noticed that one of the great stumbling blocks or faults in the way of mankind, is lack of ability to believe. I am daily in the midst of men who come in constant contact with the same truths that appeal to me, who have had laid before them the truths that have convinced me. I meet men who are honest, as far as I am able to judge, in all their dealings and acts with mankind, yet they do not always see as I see, or think as I think, or believe as I believe. Nevertheless, I know in my soul that the things I look upon as being the ideals of life, are things that will lead me to salvation, and that if others would believe them they also would be led unto salvation; but it seems impossible for them to understand them or to esteem them as I do.  
  
I wonder if among the Latter-day Saints there are those who, possibly, receive and accept, unthinkingly, the principles that are laid down before us, and the precepts that are given for our guidance day by day. That passive reception of these things is not evidence of full and entire belief. There should be no "doubting Thomases" among us. It is better to believe without seeing; better to believe by the evidences of the word that come to us from time to time in the pages of history. In histories that have been given of the lives of prophets and patriarchs of old there have been great events recorded that are not believed by many of the advanced minds of the present time. Robert G. Ingersoll wrote a book upon the mistakes of Moses; and the doings of Moses have been made a by-word in the mouths of scientific men. Great things that are recorded of the miracles performed during the early history of the world are looked upon as being mere figments of the imaginations of men, attempts to play upon the credulity of their fellowmen. We read of the miraculous journey of the children of Israel across the wilderness, their pathway preceded by a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day. We read of the striking of the rock, and the emerging therefrom of the hidden waters. We read of Joshua commanding the sun to stand still. All these things are accepted in the minds of some as true, and in the minds of others as being unbelievable. Today, in the history of the world, and of the Church, with which we are directly or indirectly associated, there have been miracles quite as great. There have been marvelous happenings in the lives of the Latter-day Saints that should elevate our minds to a knowledge of the fact that God is as near today as He has ever been in the history of the world. It is His purpose, day by day, to speak to us in one way or another, either by history or by the things that are now being fulfilled, of past prophecy or some other evidence that calls to us from the great Author of our being, with the endeavor to lead us into the way of righteousness. Those who believe, whose minds are open to receive the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, are the ones who are in the line of safety; while those whose minds are inclined to skepticism, who think that it is necessary to prove by actual demonstration, as one would prove the principles of geometry, are the ones who will not receive the reward of the believer.  
  
There are many problems confronting the Latter-day Saints at the present time. Never in the history of the Church, in modern times or in ancient days, have there been greater problems. The discoveries of the day, the inventions of mankind, the political problems, all unite to form complications so great, so difficult of understanding; that they operate upon the minds of individuals and turn them from a contemplation of the most important things in life. In the midst of all these things we become distracted, our thoughts are drawn from the ideals of our religion, not centered upon the promises of God to us. There is yet to be revealed things that will test the faith of the Latter-day Saints, and require that their belief be given readily and as cheerfully as if accompanied by tangible evidence. Therefore, in my opinion, the key that was given by the Prophet Joseph Smith is a very valuable one; the Latter-day Saints ought to study, with all due purpose of heart, the progress of the work, and endeavor to comprehend, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the ground upon which they stand. Our minds ought to be open to the influences derived from such meetings as these. When inspired men speak to us we should accept the truth or divinity of the word that we hear, not lay it aside as being of no further use, but make it a part of our mental and spiritual possessions. In this way these conferences become of great value to us, uniting the many individuals who come together from the far borders of the Church, with their varied problems; fusing us, as it were, into a perfect body, making of us the strong and powerful organization which it is necessary for us to be in order to fulfil the purposes of God.  
  
I bear my testimony to the truth of this work. I feel that if the spirit of my father were so he could see me now he would be proud that I have been honored with this position. I am glad to honor his name. It was said of him, by one of the Church authorities, who is present upon this stand today, that, like Nathaniel of old, he was a man without guile. His son may not reach that distinction, but I endeavor to follow in his footsteps, and heed the injunctions of those who have been the Church leaders in this day and dispensation in which God has restored His gospel to the earth. May the Lord add His blessing to us and continue with an increased portion of His Spirit during the remainder of this conference, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

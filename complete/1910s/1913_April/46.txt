Closing Remarks

None

There is only time for one thing more, and that is an expression from this vast conrgegation as to their feeling relative to our conference. I move that it be the sense of this vast assembly that this has been one of the best conferences that we have ever had in the Church. (Motion seconded.) All in favor will signify it. Contrary by the same sign. I see no contrary vote, it is unanimous.

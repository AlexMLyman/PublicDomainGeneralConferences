Declaration that the Lord is pleased with His people. â€” Prayer for continued success of the Lord's work.  
  
I declare unto this great gathering here that the Spirit of the Lord has been with us in this conference, with those who have spoken, and with those who have listened. The Lord is pleased with those whom He has called to direct His work in the earth in this day. He is pleased with their fidelity, and with their fearlessness to declare His truth that has been revealed, and restored to the earth again. The Lord is pleased with those whom He has called to teach the youth of Zion the principles of righteousness, the principles of truth and education. The Lord is pleased with those who sing His praises, not only here in our choir, that we have heard today, but in the choirs throughout the stakes of Zion. The Lord is pleased with all who are serving Him, who strive to honor His name and perform His work in the earth.  
  
May the Lord continue to be pleased with us. May we so live that He will continue to bless us, and look down upon us in love and mercy. May we take home with us the counsels, admonitions and teachings that we have received in this conference, both young and old; that we may honor the Lord and His servants in the earth. May He bless you in your homes and in your endeavors to serve Him and keep His commandments, to live clean and unspotted from the sins of the world. May we so live that He will be pleased with us in all of our endeavors to serve Him, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

(President of California Mission.) 

While I stand before you, my brethren and sisters, I sincerely desire the inspiration of the spirit of truth to direct my utterance. With me, I know your souls have been fed with the bread of life this day, and in the testimony of my brethren of the mission fields you have felt it like a call to battle for the right. If there has been dubiety in the minds of any as to the right of authority to preside over the things pertaining to righteousness, and the kingdom of our God in the earth, your minds were disabused of that in this morning's service, when President Smith made known unto us the mind and will of the Lord relative to the order of the Priesthood, and the order of the Church, and to the necessity of the Priesthood setting their houses and themselves in order.  
  
With Elder Ballard, I sincerely rejoice in the fact that I, too, have been born of "believing blood." Sometimes, in the mission field, I have been confronted with the thought, and with the statement that, "this alone accounts for your position as a member of the 'Mormon' faith, or Church, the fact that you were born a 'Mormon.' " At first blush, to some it may appear that there is no particular virtue in one's birth, yet through all time I have learned to have respect to that 'believing blood" spoken of in the scriptures, and recognized by the Master Himself when He said, "My sheep know my voice and the stranger they will not follow." I have learned too, from observing not only men of different nationalities, and their predisposition to do certain things because of prenatal influences and training, and different traits of thoughts and living, that in the animal world about us, those who were born to a certain end achieved it more readily than any can be trained to do so; that the bloodhound will follow with unerring scent the trail that is lost to the pampered and petted pet of some lady of high degree. And so I rejoice in the fact that I, too, have been born of believing parents, of the third generation, and it has been my prayer that there shall be no untoward act performed by me that shall turn back the tide of progress set by my ancestors toward the goal of truth and righteousness.  
  
I rejoice in the privileges of the gospel. I rejoice in the fact that all the principles thereof appeal both to the emotions and the reason of men; that there is no good thing, that there is nothing legitimate, praiseworthy or of good report to be found outside of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as revealed anew to us in these last days. Men say and have said unto me that "You don't know it all," and individually I am perfectly willing to confess that. They have said, "You don't have all within your church that is true." This I have not accepted, and I am not prepared to accept, on the contrary, I do know that there is in the genius of this gospel, which we live and keep, that which is for the salvation of the souls of men now. The gospel does not deal alone with what we may call an uncertain future, which however is certain to those who will keep the faith; it does not deal alone with the past, but is alive, is virile, and enters into every avenue of art, science and trade, into the social fabric, in everything that is praiseworthy and for the uplift of men. If in the writings of Israel Zangwill, in some of the statements he has made in his play. "The Melting Pot," he has felt the pulse of the future, and can see in this blessed land of America a nation not of many nations but one, with intent and purpose to render that which is just and true unto God and unto their fellows, it will be because of the gospel of the Lord Jesus and not because of the theories and ideals of men. Those dreamers who dream of a Utopian time when inequality shall cease, when the hireling shall be no longer oppressed in his wage, when men shall meet a brother and a friend in every land and clime, when righteousness shall obtain in the courts of justice, and men shall have been weaned away from selfishness and hate, should understand that it shall be realized only through the fruits of the gospel of the Lord Jesus, for that alone will strip man of innate selfishness, which is the bane of humanity today. The gospel of the Lord Jesus alone will cause men to prefer their neighbors to themselves, and wean them of selfishness and jealousy, and their hunger after pomp and power, fame and government. The gospel of the Lord Jesus alone will grant unto the hireling that which is his just due, and care for the widow and the fatherless. The gospel of the Lord Jesus alone will make of the proud man a humble man, will abase him and bring him on to the same level and footing with his brother who seeks after truth and after equality in all things.  
  
Upon our western seaboard we find a great many of those so-called dreamers. It seems a rich land for every creed, every idea and theory to fructify in. Frequently we have new faiths arise, and new churches are established; new methods of belief and unbelief put forth, with their various followers; more or less of the spirit of the Orient as well as of the Occident. It is surprising that so many fads and fancies find following among so-called stable minded men, and the liberally educated people of America. Recently, in Los Angeles, there was one set up and named the Church of the Living God, the tabernacle of David again in the wilderness." Some of their elders came to our headquarters to instruct us in the fact that there had been a falling away of the faith; that there has been innovations made in the gospel ordinances of the church founded by the Master; that men drew near to God with their mouths and with their lips did honor Him, but their hearts were far removed from Him, and they taught for fear the doctrines of men, and for hire made themselves specious teachers to tickle the ears of those who would not stand reproach or chatisement. I told them there would be no difficulty in teaching us the gospel which they had in mind, the "everlasting gospel" as they called it, if they could but prove to us the line of their authority and the right to teach. They entered into a dissertation of how one Joshua Sykes had been called of the Master, angels had visited him, and possibly he himself was one of the evangels of olden time, come again to the earth for the last dispensation. Then I asked them for a proof of it in the fact that God had said, as they had quoted, "that every word should be established in the mouth of two or more witnesses." Then they were confounded, for they had only the witness of one man in every step in the building up of their church. I cited them not only to the witness of men, so far as the building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was concerned, but that God, the Father Himself, was a witness, and had come with the Son, and introduced Himself to the boy prophet to open up this last dispensation. Also, John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Christ anciently, of whom the Christ said "He is the Esaias who is to come" who, if we may accept some of the writings of the early fathers, Nicodemus said went into hell itself and introduced himself in hades, to the spirits who were kept in prison from Adam unto that day, as John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ on the earth, who now had come down to the very depths of hell to make known unto them the fact of their emancipation; that the Christ should visit them there and come with healing in His wings and set the captives free, to open the prison doors; and lead the prisoners out of darkness into light. I stated that John came to men in the flesh, to Oliver and Joseph, and bestowed upon them the keys of his ministry; that Peter, James and John came to Joseph and Oliver and gave them the keys of the Melchisedek Priesthood; that the Lord Jesus, and Moses, and Elias and Elijah and many great and wonderous angels, Gabriel and Raphael, as well as these prophets of the Lord Jesus, came each in his turn with the keys of his ministry and dispensation, and in the presence of two or more witnessed bestowed them upon the prophet and his immediate associates. That line of authority has never been broken and given to another people, but has continued with the church, with all the characteristic gifts, signs, offices and ordinances that were ear-marks of Christ's church in the day when He lived and prayed for the time when God should set up His kingdom in the earth, nevermore to be thrown down or given to another people.  
  
If it does not make a man righteously proud to know that he belongs to this church and kingdom, that he participates in these gifts and blessings, I know not what can come unto the soul of man to make him so. Therefore today, with you, my brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the fact that we live, that we have being, through the grace of our Father; that we are redeemed from death and hell through the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the atonement which He wrought out, and that with Him and our Father, in the world which is to come, we shall have opportunity and time to realize all that our fond souls have yearned for and builded for in this life; that we shall be followed by objects of corresponding greatness to our ideals. There we shall come into our own, and shall be recognized throughout all eternity as the very children of our Father, into whose hands He committed the ministry of the last days for the setting up of His kingdom, and for the reclamation of the souls of men.  
  
Let us glorify Him and do our full part to bring men to a knowledge of the truth, that every man shall hear the gospel, that every soul shall know God for himself and have no need to ask his neighbor; this is my prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.

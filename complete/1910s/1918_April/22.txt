I am forcibly reminded of the saying of the Savior about the rich man, who concluded that he had so much in the world that he could well rest content, and take his ease. The Savior said:  
  
The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:  
  
And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?  
  
And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.  
  
And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  
  
But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?   
 
I cannot refrain from the mentioning the truth that was enunciated thousands of years ago: "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God," and therefore no hereafter. "They are corrupt, they have abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one."  
  
I trust we are beyond and above this dreadful condition, and that we do know that our Redeemer lives, and that we have put on Christ, and have adopted his glorious plan of redemption and salvation and exaltation beyond the grave.

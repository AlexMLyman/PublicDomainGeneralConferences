I want to say a word in explanation of this duet. I was requested to put this piece on, through some of the brethren hearing it in one of our wards, last Sunday night. I want to say a word about it for fear you will misunderstand the object of it. You might take it to be a secular, or what is sometimes termed a "love" duet. The idea is this: I have been asked thousands of times, probably, by different people who have good voices and musical ability: "Brother Stephens, I have a gifted son, a gifted daughter, would you advise me to send them abroad to study?" "Would you advise me to take or send them away from home for study?" This piece has been written for an answer to that question. My answer is, "No," and this song, "Stay. Thou with Me," is partly the answer. We have developed some splendid talent by sending it away, but as a rule, I think it is safe to say, if our young people have ties to cling to, in nine cases out of ten, it is better for them to "Stay thou with me: from my side may it not lure thee." The subject in this duet is in that way really a reply. Do not go from home; and so "Brother Stephens has not put on some 'love' duets in conference." This one is a sermon in itself.

Ashamed that Utah is not yet a prohibition State â€” Church authorities advocate temperance, and desire prohibition.  
  
The time is spent. It is not my purpose to detain you; but I desire to say, in conclusion of these services, that I endorse the remarks that have been made here by our brethren, and trust that they will find an abiding place in the hearts of those assembled here. And I wish to say to Brother John W. Hart, that while I am very much chagrined, humiliated and ashamed of the condition that prevails in the State of Utah, not because the people so willed it, I am proud to know that the State of Idaho and the State of Colorado and the State of Arizona, and the States of Washington and Oregon, in this Rocky Mountain region and the Pacific Coast have set an example that is worthy to be followed. And just one more word. The remark has been made that whispering is being indulged in to some extent by some of the people to the effect, that the authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints do not want prohibition, and I think I am in a position to say, that the authorities of the Church, the Presidency, and the Council of the Twelve, stand for temperance, and they do want such prohibition. Those who declare to the contrary, when they come to you, tell them that they speak that which is not true. And I think I know what I am talking about.  
  
I do not wish to make any more remarks because the time is spent.

Now, my brethren and sisters, we have had a good time. We will not prolong this meeting.  
  
I would like to emphasize the good things, if it were possible, that have been said in this conference, in our lives, that we may go from here better men and better women, more determined to be beneficial to our Father's children, wherever we meet them, and with a determination such as was manifest by the great Israelite, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." God help us to do so, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

President Taft's address heartily endorsed. 

I do not know how many of the Latter-day Saints present at this meeting were not here yesterday, when we had the the pleasure and profit of listening to the President of the United States, addressing the people from this stand on the great subject of Universal Peace. I hope the discourse that the President delivered here yesterday may be published in all the newspapers that every man and woman who reads the papers in the state may have the privilege of reading the sentiments expressed by our nation's Executive. I would like to say to you, that I sat her and listened with deep interest to his words, and I endorse without reserve every sentiment that he so ably and so eloquently expressed with reference to the great principle and glorious hope of "peace on earth and good will to man."

My brethren and sisters, I was in hopes that this task would pass by, as I have often said, preaching is not my forte.  
  
I have listened attentively to all which has been said during the conference, and I can endorse everything which we have heard. I realize that the Spirit of the Lord has been here during this conference, and has actuated those who have spoken to us. I trust that which we have heard will sink deep into the hearts of the people who have heard it, that we may all profit thereby.  
  
I ask God, the Eternal Father, to let His blessings rest upon all Israel and guide all of us in the true path, pour out His Spirit in rich abundance upon all who bear rule in His Church; that He may especially bless those who are called to preside, the First Presidency of the Church, the quorum of the Apostles and their associates.  
  
I trust that the Latter-day Saints may remember what they have heard during this conference, that they may go forward in the path of righteousness. I bear testimony of the goodness of the Father unto His people, and pray that we all may walk in the true path and be qualified for every duty, filling the mission whereunto our Father has called us, that we may be worthy of His blessings, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

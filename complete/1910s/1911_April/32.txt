(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

What we have heard from the brethren today in regard to our faith, and the introduction of the gospel in these latter times, are testimonies that have come from the hearts of these elders who have been faithful during long years of experience in proclaiming these great principles pertaining to the Gospel of our Lord, Jesus.  
  
I had designed, in arising before you, to make some remarks in relation to this building here, the Bureau of Information, which was found to be a necessity when vast numbers of tourists and visitors, from all the civilized nations of the earth, with their faces set toward Utah and the great west, began to come here by thousands and tens of thousands. At one of our general conferences in the year 1901, or just prior to that, one of the brethren said it would be a very good thing to establish a place where tourists and visitors could come and be informed concerning the history of the Latter-day Saints, and of their intentions for the future, and regarding the life of the people in their homes throughout this intermountain region. Accordingly, in 1902, the Church erected a small, frame building, near where this beautiful structure now stands, and when that was finished, the people began to flock to it, visitors from the United States, and from the old world.  
  
Two years later it was found that a larger and a better building was needed, and so the frame one was removed and the present brick structure was erected. In the year last past, 1910, the eastern portion of the building was added, for the benefit of the numerous visitors to this temple block. Brother Benjamin Goddard, the director of this institution under the Presidency of the Church, with fifty or more helpers, male and female, are daily engaged in receiving the visitors. I am proud to say to you that since the opening of this building, the establishment of this bureau of information, we have, in the ten years, had visitors to the number of about 2,000,000 generally intelligent people, averaging about 200,000 each year, among whom are found the very best classes of people that the world contains today, and including some of the nobility of Europe.  
  
When I use the word nobility, I speak of the ranks established among the crowned heads and noble families of Europe, as they are recognized there. But, I recognize this grand truth, my brethren and sisters, and friends, that there are no more noble people in the earth, nor ever will be any more noble people visit these grounds than I see before me today. I realize that, of the working men, manufacturers, and the many other classes of people who have come here as tourists and visitors, the farmers, tillers of the soil rank among the best on the earth. There are no more noble people than those who cultivate the soil God has given them, make it produce the necessaries of life, and provide comforts and blessings for themselves and their families. I refer not only to Latter-day Saints, but also to our friends that are gathered in the different states, neighbors to our people in these great western communities. I say again, they are among the noble people of the earth. We are trying to teach them the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as we have learned it. We have learned that humility was necessary, and that faith in God was also a requisite. When we have attained humility and faith, we desire further to learn how to serve the Lord and keep His commandments. Hence, our elders teach that it is necessary to be so humble, so contrite in spirit, that we will desire, that we will not rest contented, until we have done as did our Savior, our Lord Jesus, when He came to John in the wilderness, and said: I seek baptism at your hands, John. He demanded, it is worded, and that demand was no doubt made in such gentle language that this prophet, (who was that prophet who had lifted his voice against Herod's sin and iniquity), this prophet from the wilderness, John, said to him: "I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?" We know, my brethren, sisters, and friends, this fact that, if it was necessary for our Lord, our Redeemer, to receive baptism from the hands of one who was called and ordained to minister in that service, it is absolutely necessary that we follow His great and glorious example. We must go into the waters of baptism, for the remission of our sins, that we may stand spotless and clean before our Maker; then receive the laying on of hands, by one called and appointed to that authority, for the reception of the Holy Ghost, which shall lead the minds of all who accept these glorious principles to greater light, greater knowledge, and greater wisdom than could be possessed without it.  
  
My brethren and sisters, speaking of that great temple which is in our view, I remember very well the days of the dedicatorial service therein, and I remember one fact I learned there that brought to my mind great comfort and joy; I heard a prophet of the Lord testify that he had received a vision from the eternal world. In that great Rouse President Woodruff stood up and testified: "About three years ago," said he, "I recived in vision a visit from President Brigham Young. President Brigham Young came to me, and said, 'Brother Woodruff, take the keys of the temple, and unlock the doors and let the people in.' "  
  
Brother Woodruff said, "At that time I was president of the apostles, President John Taylor was then living, and was President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and I marveled that Brigham Young had come to me and given me this commission; but today," said he, "President Taylor has passed away, and I have been called to occupy this responsible position, of president of the Church; and now I no longer marvel, for I have done as I was commanded, and I have taken the keys to this holy house, and I have opened the doors and I have bid the people enter."  
  
Now, my brethren and sisters, as has been testified to you today, that building stands as a monument of the faithful labors of the Latter-day Saints. When Brigham Young came here, a pioneer, with his faithful little band of one hundred, and forty-three persons, he placed the point of his cane in the ground, nearly at the southeast corner, it is believed, of where the building now stands, and he said, "Here we will build the house of the Lord, a temple to our God." Forty years after its commencement it was finished; it was begun in 1853, and completed in 1893.  
  
Now, my brethren and sisters, it was for no ulterior or wicked purpose or plan that that magnificent structure was erected. It was reared by the faithful labor and toil of the Latter-day Saints; and, especially in the first few years of its progress, the building was continued by the help of the people while in extreme poverty, with very little means to push it forward. Hence its development was slow. But, at its completion we were satisfied, because testimonies were borne in that sacred building, during the dedicatorial services, that God had indeed accepted it, even as He accepted those temples that had been builded before. This fact was verified by the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon those brethren who testified that God had indeed accepted the labors of the Latter-day Saints, and sanctioned the placing of His name upon that sacred building.  
  
Now, my brethren and sisters, I thank you very much for your attention here this afternoon, and I thank our visitors also. I say to all those who have been here to view these temple grounds, and hear about the Latter-day Saints, you are welcomed, heartily welcomed by those who labor here in this bureau of information. I repeat, you are welcome here today, my brethren, sisters, and friends; we greet you as friends, and we are glad to see you always. May God bless you wherever you go, in all your walks of life. If there are any here who have not had faith in the gospel, as we have faith in it, I trust that your hearts may be softened to that degree by what you have heard, and what you may hear in the future, that you too will receive the spirit of repentance, and draw near unto God, and be enabled to work out your salvation and redemption; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

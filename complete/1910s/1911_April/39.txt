CLOSING REMARKS. 

None

I regret that we haven't a little more time, but we will try to make the best we can of the little remaining.  
  
I have a resolution, forwarded to me by the Ogden tabernacle choir, which I desire to read, because I think it shows a very excellent spirit:  
  
"At the regular rehearsal of the Ogden tabernacle choir, Thursday evening, last, the following motion was made and carried unanimously: 'That we extend to the director and members of the Salt Lake tabernacle choir the sincere hope that they may be truly successful in holding up high ideals while on their trip to New York. They will represent the entire state of Utah, and as such representatives we desire to uphold and sustain them in every way possible. Bon voyage to the Salt Lake tabernacle choir.' "

Out of deference to the love we bear, and always have borne, and always hope to, toward the sons and descendants of President Brigham Young, I will read this telegram which I hold in my hand:  
  
"President Joseph F. Smith, Salt Lake,  
City, Utah:  
 
"Regarding it as a sacred duty and glorious privilege, I report at conference time with humble assurance of faith and prayers for you, the brethren, and Saints. As my hope to be present is unrealized, my prayers are more fervent for the way to open for October. With warm regards,  
"Respectfully yours,  
  
"John W. Young."

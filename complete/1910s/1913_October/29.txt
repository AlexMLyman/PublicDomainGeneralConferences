I think the natural inquiry that would arise in the minds of all present this morning after listening to the remarks which we have heard would be, can we as intelligent men and women, professing to be honest before God, resist the force, the justice and the righteousness of the appeals that are being made to us? Can we do it? I say we cannot and be Latter-day Saints.

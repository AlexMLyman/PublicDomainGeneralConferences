(Late President of the Mexican Mission.) 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, that the time is far past, and I merely desire to bear testimony to the fact that I know that the gospel is true; I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.  
  
I testify to you that I know that Joseph F. Smith is inspired of the Lord for the work that he has to do.  
  
May the Lord help us follow the counsel of our leaders, these men of God, and to live according to the gospel, and have a burning testimony of it always in their hearts, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ADJOURNMENT. 

None

I desire to thank you, my brethren and sisters, one and all, for your continued presence and goodly attention which you have given to that which has been said and done. I also desire to express my appreciation and gratitude to the Choir and to those who have made music for us during the conference. I wish to extend my hearty good will and best wishes to all the Latter-day Saints, throughout the world, and to all people; for our mission is to save the world from the errors of men, from the darkness of superstition and ignorance, and to bring them to the light of Truth; that they may walk in the light as God is in the light; that they may have fellowship with him, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse them from all sin.  
  
After the benediction, this conference will be adjourned until next April.

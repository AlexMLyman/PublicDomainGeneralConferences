A MOTION TO PURCHASE LIBERTY BONDS. 

None

This does not mean a donation, but simply that we buy bonds and thereby help our Government. I think that everybody present feels that we must do everything we can to sustain the Government, as we have declared that we are willing to do. We cannot shirk the duties that devolve upon us as citizens of this State and this Nation. We want to sustain the Nation, to sustain the Government, in the pursuit of obtaining a victory for the right; and I move that we authorize the Trustee-in-Trust to negotiate for such an amount of these bonds as he shall find that the means of the Church can stand, not to exceed a quarter of a million dollars.

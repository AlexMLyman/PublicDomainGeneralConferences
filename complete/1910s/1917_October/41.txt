SECONDING THE MOTION TO PURCHASE LIBERTY BONDS. 

None

I arise to second the motion presented by President Lund. Perhaps you did not all hear it distinctly. The resolution is that this Conference, representing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, authorize the Trustee-in-Trust to negotiate for the purchase of Liberty Bonds, in aid of our great Nation and Government to defend the principles of constitutional liberty, and to wage a war of defense against oppression and tyranny in all the world, for the purpose of aiding in spreading light and truth and freedom to all nations, and that the President of the Church, the Trustee-in-Trust, be authorized to enter into this negotiation for the purchase of bonds as circumstances will permit, and not to exceed the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I second the motion with great pleasure, believing that it will be for the right, and that it will be supported by the Latter-day Saints who are true in the faith, everywhere.

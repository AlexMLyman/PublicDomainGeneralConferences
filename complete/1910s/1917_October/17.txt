PRIMARY EXHIBIT 

None

I am reminded that the Presidency and the Twelve were invited, yesterday, by the Presidency of the Primary Association, to visit the exhibit of the handiwork of the little children for the benefit of afflicted soldiers. The exhibit is placed in the upper, large room of the Bishop's building, and I am sure Sister Felt and her associates will be pleased to have any of the brethren and sisters who desire to see what is being done by the children, in the Primary work, to call and visit them.

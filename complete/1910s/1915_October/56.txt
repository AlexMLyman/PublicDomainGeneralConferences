In this tabernacle, and in the assembly hall, and in our opening meetings during this conference, 39 presidents of stakes and 10 presidents of missions have spoken and borne testimony, and I regret that we did not occupy all day yesterday, as well as the Sabbath and Monday and today, in hearing the testimonies of our brethren who stand at the head of the various stakes and missions of the Church. I think we have heard very much to convince us that the Lord has made wise choice in the selection of those men, who have spoken to us, to occupy the important positions they are called unto.  
  
It will be necessary on account of the shortness of time to change our course a little. Brother Smoot will be leaving us to attend to his duties at Washington, we would like to have him express himself and bear his testimony before he goes. The other brethren of the Twelve and of the Seventies will be with us and will visit you from time to time, and you will hear from them again. We will now give a few moments of the time to Brother Smoot.

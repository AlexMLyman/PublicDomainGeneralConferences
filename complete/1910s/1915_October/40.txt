Commending faithful services and worth of Stake Presidents.  
  
We have had the honor of listening to a few of the good and great men from among the seventy-two, who stand at the head of that many stakes of Zion. Surely the sheep in the folds over which these good shepherds preside cannot take any hurt if they will listen to the counsel and drink freely of the spirit manifested here by the men who preside over them, as we have heard and witnessed by their fervent spirit and powerful testimonies borne to us during this conference. For my own part I cannot but express the sincerest gratitude of my soul for such men; and from the depths of my heart I bless them and invoke the blessing of Almighty God upon them. We will not be able to hear, from all of these good men, but we propose to hear from as many of them as the time will permit, and we would like our brethren of the presidencies of the stakes to make up their minds to be called upon. They do not know where the call will hit, nor who will come next; but we would like them to be in possession of the spirit of their calling and ministry so that when they come up here to address the conference, they can express themselves as those have clone who have already spoken to us. God bless the people who dwell under the watch-care of these good men and help them to humble themselves before them and be submissive to the counsel and direction of their leaders.

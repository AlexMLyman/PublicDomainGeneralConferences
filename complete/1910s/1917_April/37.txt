(President of the Alberta Stake, Canada.) 

I am from Canada, "men of the North are we." We have been at war, assisting our mother country for upwards of three years. Having been born here in Salt Lake, but now being a citizen of Canada, I am pleased with the attitude of my Uncle Sam.  
  
We have nearly fifty of our finest young men right at the front in France today. Before they went, a great number of people volunteered their services. When the recruiting officers came in our section of the country, they did not go among the people as they had done among other people, but they came in our Tabernacle and asked that we suit ourselves in volunteering our services. In doing that, they received the aid and the assistance of our home militia, the finest body of young men in all western Canada, "Mormon" boys, who had spent upwards of seven years in training, about ten days each year, and who had won high honor in all the competitions open to the home guard of Canada. They were the boys, seventy-five of them, who kept the Word of Wisdom, every one of them, and they were commented upon by the highest military officers of Canada. When we spoke about those who should volunteer, the officers said, "Give us these boys; we know them."  
  
The boys came, and under the hands of those who preside, received their blessings, and not one has been lost in all the armies of Europe among the Allied portion, which we represent and of which we form a part.  
  
When the time comes for any of you to volunteer, let it be said that the very best young men go. I see the wisdom of President Wilson's suggestion that possibly conscription should be put in force: they want the good men to go, and to get them, they may need to call them.  
  
Not long ago, we had one of our missionaries from Switzerland, who was doing missionary work in Germany. He told of a circumstance which shows to me that the "Mormon" people have not any enmity in their hearts. I do not believe any of us desire to kill a German or an Austrian or any of the Teutonic nations in war, except as we may be called upon to defend ourselves. Imagine on the field of battle a German member of this Church receiving also under the hands of the missionaries a blessing that he should go in battle, and that he would not lose his life. The missionary states that this particular young man went to the front, his battalion was called to charge upon the English, and he noticed after the charge that very few were left. They were commanded a second time to charge. He remembered the blessing that he should not lose his life, and, he said, they made the charge, and all he could then remember was that he should not be called upon to shed blood nor lose his life, and he wondered how it would come to pass. After the charge was made the next he remembered was that he was in a hospital in Berlin.  
  
Our boys from Canada had the same blessing given to them. Imagine a Canadian and a German "Mormon" boy meeting on the field of battle, each with that promise that they would not be called upon to shed blood nor lose their life in battle. Can you see any better solution to universal peace than by and through the sensing of religion as we feel it as Latter-day Saints, commonly called "Mormons"? So much for the war.  
  
I am pleased to be with you today, this Easter day. We heard in the Tabernacle yesterday and this morning some very splendid discourses upon the theme of the resurrection of the body, from a Scriptural standpoint. Let me take the time to tell you something outside of the Scripture, which has come under my personal observation.  
  
We have to the north and the south of our country Indian reservations. We have recently had an Indian by the name of Brother Warner, from Parker, Idaho, come up and do missionary work among the Blood and Blackfoot Indians across the border in Montana from our country. He and a young man named Galbraith — you saw his picture in the Era a few months ago, where he was in Washington and introduced to the President of the United States. He went there in behalf of the Indians on the reservation in making their allotments. His mother was an Indian, a Blackfoot woman. His father was an honorable Scotchman living very close to our country on the Blackfoot reservation.  
  
This Brother Galbraith had a dream. He said he came to our meeting. He saw in the meeting, in his dream, four or five old Indian chiefs siting on the stand. He knew these Indians were dead and had been for a long time. One of them was his uncle. The highest point on the Rocky Mountains near us was called Old Chief. That was the name of his uncle, the highest chief among the Blackfoot nation. He said as he went into the audience that this uncle of his told him to come up on the stand with him, and he said he wondered how it was, because this man was dead; he knew this. He went up and he heard his uncle stand up and preach a sermon to the audience there and turn around and say, "This nephew of mine must be our representative among our people." Be it said to Brother Galbraith's honor that although a half-breed Indian, he honors his race and is never ashamed of his Indian blood. He said the man spoke in a language he could understand, and he marveled at it.  
  
When he got to this, Brother Galbraith said, "What have I got to do?" He said, "You see a book on the table" — and he pointed to a book on the table — "that book contains the history of our people. We are what people call all dead, and you are in the life, with the book. It will be told to you what to do." He awoke, and after two long years of investigating, he joined the Church.  
  
When Brother Warner came up, by permission of President Ballard, he went over and visited Brother Galbraith, and they went among the Indians, and they aroused a lot of interest among the Indians, and held a meeting in a half-caste's house. There sat in a corner a lady, a chief's daughter, and a man by her side, who was a half-caste. Brother Galbraith said when he looked down on those two they became almost white in his eyes. Whenever he spoke about the Book of Mormon the lady would apparently go white, and he marveled at it. When he got through the man stood up and said, "I know more about that book than you do, Brother Galbraith. I can see that. Let me tell you what I know. For three consecutive years I have taken my family and gone off into the woods, and when I got there (the first year was 1914), pitched my tepee and went off in the forest. I was told by a man who came there to meet me that I was to lie down under the trees, wrap my blankets around me, and go with him on a journey. So I did it. I went right off, and looked down on my body when I went with this visitor — saw an Indian there wrapped in his blankets, and I wondered how it was that I was living and yet it was I there wrapped in my own blankets. I wondered if anybody would come along and bury my body before I returned. We were gone a day, and the visitor had taught me, oh, so many things — many things you would not believe if I told you. because my own family do not believe them. The messenger said I was to come in 1915, and I did it. I went again on the journey. In 1916 the messenger said to me, after taking the usual, trip and seeing my body there wrapped in my blankets as before — and after the whole tribe called me a visionary man — said, 'During this year you will have a little dark man come to you with a book. That is the book that will tell you of the history of your people.' "  
  
The man stood up and said, "There is the little dark man, Brother Warner. I saw him here yesterday. He had the book in his hand. The old Indian told him to give me the book, and I have longed for it for three years. And he took it and wrapped it in what they call their sacred cloth, and said to the man, "Brother Warner, this is my book, not yours."  
  
He did not want anything to do with the Church at all — when they held a public meeting he went off among the Indians and got an interpreter to read the Book of Mormon to them.  
  
He saw his body. That is what I want to impress upon you. A great many of us Latter-day Saints have vague ideas of what the resurrection actually is. I was pleased to feel that today we could hold General conference on the day commemorated as the day of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Yet how few really look upon the resurrection as I saw it, in my experience on the islands of the Navigator Group, in 1889.  
  
A young man from Provo — a great many know him, but I will not mention his name because what happened to him did not do him much good — was told by his mother not to go in bathing. We had been accustomed to bathing every day in the ocean, and had become good swimmers before this young man arrived. I coaxed him to go in swimming with us in the ocean. Those of you who have come from the old country know what it looks like on the beach when the tide is out. Those islands are surrounded by a coral reef, and in the reef there are large holes, ten to eighteen feet deep, and when the tide is out, we wind our way, guarding ourselves from the holes, until we come to the edge of the reef. Then we dive out into deep water, where we used to anchor our boat.  
  
I coaxed this young man to go. We got our bathing suits, and he followed me out. I wound my way through the coral reef, and swam out to where three others of our elders were. When I got there, one of the other brethren said, "Did not that brother follow you out?" I said, "Yes." But I looked around and could not see him anywhere. He had told me he could not swim, and I thought he was bathing in the shallow water.  
  
We swam to the reef and hunted around and saw the young man in about twelve feet of water, in the attitude of prayer. We dove down, lifted his body up, and brought it up to the beach. Blood was coming from his ears and mouth and nose. We worked with him until we could see that he was dead.  
  
You can hardly imagine my feelings, feeling myself almost responsible for the death of that young man. The natives gathered around and said, "It is sacreligious to work with a body after it is dead." But I suggested to the mission president that we take him into a house, dress him in his garments, and administer to him. Then I should feel more satisfied. We worked for over forty minutes with that young man's body, carried him onto the beach with his head down, his feet on my shoulders. No sign of life at all.  
  
We laid his body on a table, with over five hundred natives witnessing the ceremony of the anointing with oil. We anointed him and we blessed him. I felt his eyes move under my hands, and he awoke and came to, and asked us to place him up on the table and he would tell us what he saw, "before I forget it," he said, "for I can feel it is going from me just like I might be leaving a room."  
  
He said, "I called, when I got into deep water. You paid no attention to me, and the last thing that I thought of was of my mother's admonishing me to always pray in time of danger. When you took my body out of the water I was with you. When you walked up and down the beach I walked up and down with you. I saw my body. I prayed to God with all my soul that you would not bury me nor consider me dead until you exercised the power of your priesthood. I was told by something that it was the priesthood that had the power to return my spirit to my body. I watched you all the time. I wondered why you did not do it, having this glorious ordinance in the Church. You elders apparently were going to forget all about it. And oh, how glorious, when you exercised your priesthood and anointed me with oil in the name of the Son of God and through the priesthood which you had! As soon as you said that, my spirit body entered my physical body." I am here to testify unto you what I know to be a positive fact.  
  
This, to me, my brethren and sisters, is the power of God unto salvation to those who obey and believe. By that power does the resurrection of the body come. I do not care what anybody says about this resurrection "fallacy," as our esteemed friends term it sometimes. I saw that thing happen, call it what you will.  
  
God bless you. Amen.

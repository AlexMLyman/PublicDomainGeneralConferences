(President of the Eastern States Mission.) 

It is indeed a pleasure to me to have this opportunity of meeting with you, my brethren and sisters, in this open air meeting. If the people of the world could only see the splendid audience that has gathered today to receive the word of the Lord, they could no longer charge that the Church is failing in numbers, or in interest pertaining to the doctrine that has been revealed. With the missionary who is in the world and with the Lat-day Saint at home, as well, we have learned to regard all seasons as summer, every place a tabernacle; and I know of nothing more glorious than to meet with the children of our Heavenly Father under the canopy which he has spread over our heads. I sincerely trust that you will pay close attention to the speakers and remain, although standing is tiresome. Why should not the Latter-day Saints stand for an hour or two and listen to the word of the Lord, when we expect it of those who are not of the Church?

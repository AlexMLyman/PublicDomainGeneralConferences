I hope you will pardon me for expressing a single thought. It is well understood that there are in the world two great principles or powers, and these two are opposed to each other. One is the principle or power of truth; the other is that of error and ignorance, which is evil. That is, God's truth and its adversary. It is too true often that the adversary of truth has been compelled to adopt or mix a little of God's truth with his errors and heresies, in order to better prevail over the whole truth, and more effectively to defeat it. These apparent improvements on the part of error are no great evidences of concurrence in the purposes of God; and we should not forget it!

First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
We are again blessed with the presence of President Grant at this service, and we are grateful to our Heavenly Father for this blessing. President Grant has asked me to conduct the services.  
  
The music this afternoon will be furnished by members of the Tabernacle Choir. Not all of the members can attend, owing to their being employed in places from which they cannot be excused, but those who can attend are here. While we sang very well this morning, I suppose we will have to admit that they can sing better than we did.  
  
The choir is under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall. Elder Alexander Schreiner is at the organ.

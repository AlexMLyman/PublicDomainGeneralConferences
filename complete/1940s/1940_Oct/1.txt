First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
The time has come to open the One Hundred Eleventh Semi-annual Conference. I am more grateful than I can say, and we here are more grateful than we can express, that President Grant is with us this morning and is presiding at this meeting. He has asked me to conduct these services.  
  
All official meetings of the Church are announced in the Conference Folders, which may be obtained at the entrance to the Tabernacle. Those who expect to attend any of these meetings should provide themselves with a copy. All other notices, such as reunions, etc., will be found in The Deseret News.  
  
The music this morning will be by the Singing Mothers of Bonneville, Cottonwood, Emigration, Ensign, Highland and Wells Stakes. They will sing under the direction of Sisters Josephine Brower and Olive N. Rich. The congregational singing will be under the direction of Richard P. Condie. The organist is Dr. Frank W. Asper.

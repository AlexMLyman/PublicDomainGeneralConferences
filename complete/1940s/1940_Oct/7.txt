First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
I would like to repeat my slogan of last Conference: Brethren and sisters, "Drive carefully." There is no reason why we should have a tragedy of death at almost every Conference which we hold. Brothers and sisters, if you will just take a little more time to get home or to get here, we will excuse you for being late at the meetings if you do so, and then we will not have these tragedies.

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We all acknowledge the blessings of the Lord in permitting President Grant to come and re-deliver and make his own, the messages of the Lord which have been declared in the past. We thank him for his blessing and his assurance that the Lord will prosper His work.  
  
The choir will sing in closing, "O Great is the Depth," by Mendelssohn, after which we shall ask Governor Henry H. Blood to pronounce the closing prayer.  
  
We must not let this Conference close before expressing our gratitude — not only my gratitude, but the gratitude of all of us — for the wonderful work of this Choir, for their great devotion to their service; to the conductor, the assistant conductor, the organists, and of course to Brother Richard L. Evans in connection with the broadcast.  
  
Drive carefully; pedestrians, walk sensibly.  
  
After the benediction this Conference will adjourn sine die.

First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
You brethren, returned Mission Presidents, we shall now turn to you to give us the balance of the afternoon. Again I suggest to you that we should like to hear as many as we can. We can hear more if you will speak five minutes and quit than if you speak ten minutes, and anything under five minutes is five minutes.  
  
Will Brother William T. Tew, Jr., formerly president of the East Central States Mission please come to the stand.

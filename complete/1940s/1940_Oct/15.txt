First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
We are blessed again this morning in having with us President Grant, who is presiding at this meeting, and has asked me to conduct the services.  
  
The singing today will be congregational, under the direction of Elder J. Spencer Cornwall, except for one solo. Our organist is Alexander Schreiner. The opening song will be by the congregation, "O Say, What is Truth?", by Melling, hymn book, page 17.

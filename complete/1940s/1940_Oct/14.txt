The Singing Mothers Chorus, under the direction of Sister Nellie M. Bennion, will sing: "The Lord is my light," by Allitson.  
  
I am sure that I express the gratitude of all the people here in conference, and those who have been listening in on the air to these Singing Mothers for their splendid music.  
  
Again I urge you brethren and sisters to drive carefully, and save your lives and the lives of others.

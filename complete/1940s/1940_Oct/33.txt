First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
There are literally thousands of people who cannot get in the Tabernacle at all this morning, and hundreds are standing in the entrances and aisles. Please do the best you can to give some of them seats. On the sides, too, as well as the center, and up in the gallery. Be good enough to move as close together as possible. It would be very helpful.  
  
We are again blessed with the presence of President Grant, who will preside at this meeting and who will speak to us. He has asked me to conduct the services.  
  
The music this morning will be by the Tabernacle Choir, under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall. Elder Alexander Schreiner is at the organ.

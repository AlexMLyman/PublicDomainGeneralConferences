We have a number of released Mission presidents. We hope to hear from as many of them as possible. In order, however, that we may hear as many as possible, we shall ask them to be good enough to confine themselves to five minutes time. Anything under five minutes is five minutes. Five minutes is not six or seven or ten.  
  
Our first speaker will be President Joseph Jacobs, of the Palestine-Syrian Mission.

First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
SUSTAINING THE AUTHORITIES  
  
We shall now sustain the General Authorities of the Church.  
  
For the benefit of those in the audience and those listening on the air, who may not understand this proceeding, I will make the following brief statement.  
  
CHURCH OFFICERS SUSTAINED BY ASSEMBLY  
  
In this Church all the General Authorities and other Church-wide officers are "sustained", — in a certain sense, "elected" — by the body of the Church in a General Conference, which is, speaking politically, a constituent assembly.  
  
NOMINATING POWER RESTS WITH PRESIDENT  
  
In this Church, the power of "nominating" or calling to office, is not in the body of the Church. This power is vested in the General Authorities of the Church, and in final analysis in the President of the Church who comes to his place under the guidance of inspired revelation. As a matter of fact, as our Articles of Faith — more or less the equivalent of the creeds of other Churches — declare:  
  
"We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof."  
  
When the presiding authority has so "nominated" or chosen, or called any man to office, that man is then presented to the body of the Church to be sustained, in political language "elected."  
  
Thus the body of the Church has no calling or "nominating" power, but only the sustaining, or politically speaking, the "electing" power.  
  
When the presiding authority presents any man to the body of the Church to be sustained, the only power which the assembly has is to vote, by uplifted hand, either to sustain or not to sustain.  
  
MEMBERS CANNOT PROPOSE MEN FOR OFFICE  
  
Obviously, neither the body of the Church, nor any of its members, can propose that other men be called to office, for the calling of men is the sole power and function of the presiding authority.  
  
Therefore all debate, all proposals of other names, all discussions of merit and worthiness, are wholly out of order in such an assemblage. Any person attempting so to interrupt the proceedings would be a disturber of the public peace, amenable to the ordinary peace officers of the law and would of course be so dealt with.  
 
CHANGES TO BE PREFERRED IN REGULAR WAY 
  
I ought to say that any person having any charge to make against any officer of the Church can do so before the regular Church tribunals established for that very purpose of affording means of carrying out the discipline of the Church. But this sustaining, constituent assemblage of the Church is not such a tribunal.  
  
We shall now proceed to propose the General Authorities of the Church for the sustaining vote of this great body of Priesthood and Church membership.  
  
This is a solemn ceremony. You members of the Priesthood are exercising one of your greatest privileges and highest prerogatives.

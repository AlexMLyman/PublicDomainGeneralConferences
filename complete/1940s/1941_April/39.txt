First Counselor in the First Presidency

We are honored this morning by the presence of Dr. James E. West, celebrating his thirtieth year as Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America. In his time nine and a half millions of boys have been members; now one and a half million Boy Scouts are enrolled. We have in the L. D. S. Church 25,000 Scouts. Tomorrow at the Hotel Utah there will be a conference of Utah Scout leaders.

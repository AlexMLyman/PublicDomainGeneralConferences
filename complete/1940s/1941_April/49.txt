Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I am sure no one can arise for the first time on an occasion like this without feeling a thrill of emotion. I have spent many hours in the service of our great Church and I want to testify to you this afternoon that the compensation for that service has been very great. I rejoice in the testimony which I have of the Truth. I know God's work has been established on the earth; I know that the Gospel is true; that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. I have confidence in the leadership of this Church. If we follow their advice we shall never go astray. May God bless them, and may He bless us that our eyes may be open to appreciate and understand the everlasting things which will not perish.  
  
I accept this responsibility with fear and trembling, but I have confidence in the promises of God. God bless you. Amen.

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The time has arrived to open the sixth and last session of this General Conference. President Heber J. Grant is presiding and he has asked President Clark to conduct the services.  
  
Again I repeat, through the courtesy of KSL and other stations cooperating, this service is being broadcast to four stations in Idaho, one in Price, and one in Cedar City. The Presidents of Stakes in these localities have arranged meetings in various of their Ward meeting houses. We have already heard from some of them saying they are having a good time. A direct wire from the Tabernacle here to the Los Angeles Tabernacle is also carrying the services to that area.  
  
There are present on the stand this afternoon President Grant and his two Counselors, the full quorum of the Twelve, all of the First Seven Presidents of Seventies, and all of the Presiding Bishopric.

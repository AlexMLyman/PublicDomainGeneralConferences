You will be interested in the following brief report from President Thomas E. McKay, President of the European Mission, regarding the Missions in Europe:  
  
REPORT OF CONDITIONS IN THE EUROPEAN MISSIONS  
  
It is more than a year now since the 699 American missionaries laboring in the twelve missions classified as European were released to come home or were transferred to missions in America. At the time of the evacuation, capable local brethren were placed in charge, and they are carrying on the work quite successfully. Because of mobilization and war, nearly all of our brethren of military age have been called to the front, and the work is having to be taken care of by the elderly brethren and the sisters.  
  
However, our Sacrament meetings, Sunday Schools, and Relief Societies, and Mutuals to a limited extent, are being held. Because of a shortage of fuel, and blackouts, most of these meetings must be held in the day time, and are combined, or one is held immediately following the other.  
  
In spite of these handicaps, progress is being made. The district and annual conferences are being held. Limited missionary work is being done, especially in the British Mission where the brethren holding the Melchizedek Priesthood are excused from army service. Baptisms are reported from all the missions. Tithing and Fast Offerings are being paid, collections of food and clothing are made quite regularly, and the less fortunate of the members are being well cared for.  
  
The following paragraph, taken from the Norwegian Mission Report, is typical of reports from a number of the missions:  
  
"Many of the Saints have lost all they own — home, property, work. All they have left is the clothes they wear. Many have taken part in the fights, but their lives are spared. These hardest afflicted of the Saints have not lost their faith. They have seen that even if they have lost everything else, God has saved their lives."  
  
Because of the extremely heavy bombings recently in the British Isles the First Presidency were very much relieved, and we are sure you will be, to learn in a letter received today, dated London, March 15, stating among other encouraging news the following:  
  
"The conditions of the British Mission are about the same. All the branches are functioning and we have had no casualties or damage within the last two months."  
  
A previous letter had reported damage to the leased property at 295 Edge Lane, Liverpool, where the Millennial Star was published and the bookstore located. These activities are now carried on at our headquarters at 149 Nightingale Lane, London.  
  
Except in Paris, France, the headquarters of all the missions, including the Czechoslovakian and Palestine-Syrian Missions, are being maintained as usual, and very encouraging reports are being received from all the Acting Mission Presidents. They all say: "Don't worry about us, we are all right — we have the Gospel."

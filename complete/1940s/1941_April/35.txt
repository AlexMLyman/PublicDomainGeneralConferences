First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I should like again to express our gratitude and appreciation to this wonderful chorus that has come to us from Idaho. We are grateful to them for all the work they have done in preparing to do this singing for us. They are a splendid group of young people, and we certainly pray that the Lord will bless them in their labors.  
  
Please drive carefully, brethren and sisters. I do not know how widespread this storm may be, but be careful, and if any of these young people in the choir are returning home tonight I hope they and their drivers will be particularly careful. You who are walking on the streets, please be good enough to walk carefully and observe the signals.

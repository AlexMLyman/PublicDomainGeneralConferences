Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, a little over twelve years ago I was surprised, and I might say shocked, to be called to succeed President Stephen L. Chipman as President of the Alpine Stake. I remember well a lesson that he taught me then. In being released he and his counselor, President James H. Clark, who remained in our Stake, came to the new presidency and in assuring us of their support said they wanted to work wherever we wanted them to work. And then President Chipman gave us some counsel which I have always remembered, and that was to find out what was expected of us and then to do it to the best of our ability. I have learned to appreciate that counsel, and while I do not know now what is expected, (this is entirely new as far as I am concerned, and perhaps it is a new departure) I assure my brethren and the Authorities of the Church that I will meet this responsibility to the best of my ability and will give it the best I have. My one prayer is that I may be able to make the right adjustment, that I may not be hampered in any way in doing that which shall be expected of me.  
  
I appreciate my membership in this Church. I am thankful for my parents who implanted in their children faith and confidence in this great work, and I humbly pray that I may not fail in this responsibility, that I may be able to measure up to every requirement and to every expectation that you and the Brethren who preside have a right to expect. May God help us all to sustain each other and to uphold this work of God I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

First Counselor in the First Presidency  
  
I repeat: Please drive carefully, the streets are very slippery; and pedestrians will be good enough to walk cautiously and carefully.  
  
We would like particularly to say a word of commendation to the Blackfoot Stake Choir. Some of the members of this Choir have traveled regularly to their rehearsals a distance of fifty miles, and they have never missed a rehearsal. This represents what the Church Music Committee is trying to do in ail of our Stakes. I would like to say to the Utah Valley people and the Brigham Young University that they must look to their laurels for up in the Snake River Valley there is a group that is pressing very hard on their heels.

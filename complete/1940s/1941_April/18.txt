First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We thank the Choir for the beautiful songs which they have sung to us today. We always know when we have the Brigham Young University Chorus that we will have good music.  
  
I again urge that as you leave here to drive to your homes, you drive carefully, and I ask the pedestrians to walk sensibly as they cross the roads.

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The moment has arrived for opening the third session of this Conference. We are indeed grateful again this morning, notwithstanding the inclement weather, that President Grant is with us and is presiding. He has asked President Clark to conduct the services.  
  
Through the courtesy of Radio Station KSL and of the other Radio Stations cooperating the meetings of this Conference are being broadcast over KFXD at Nampa; KSEI at Pocatello; KTFI at Twin Falls; KID at Idaho Falls; KSUB at Cedar City; and KEUB at Price.  
  
The Presidents of Stakes in these localities are arranging meetings in various of their Ward meeting houses where Ward and Stake congregations can hear the Conference. A direct wire from the Tabernacle to the Los Angeles Stake Tabernacle in Los Angeles, California, will bring the services to that area.  
  
We were advised last evening that the reception was very good in all these areas, and that people were coming together and enjoying the services.  
  
There are present on the stand this morning President Grant and his two Counselors, the eleven Apostles, all of the First Seven Presidents of Seventies, and all of the Presiding Bishopric.  
  
The music today will be furnished by the Blackfoot Stake Choir, Elder Ronald Bitton, Director, Elder Frank W. Asper, Organist.

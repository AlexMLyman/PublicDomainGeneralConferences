Elder Orval W. Adams, at the request of President Clark, read the following report:  
  
President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, Dear Brethren:  
  
We have examined the Financial report of the Church for the year 1940. The records are complete, accurate and intelligible; the accounting system is adequate and modern; the budget is in balance, and the Church is free from debt.  
  
Sincerely yours,  
  
Orval W. Adams  
 
Albert E. Bowen H. H.  
 
Bennett George S. Spencer

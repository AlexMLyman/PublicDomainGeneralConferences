First Counselor in the First Presidency 

All of the brethren who have spoken have indicated there are two terrors which we up here suffer. One is the anxiety which runs along until we are called, and the other is the fear which we have when we are called. We cannot relieve Brother Lee of the first, but we will relieve him of the second by calling him now, following Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Council of the Twelve who has just spoken.  
  
Our next speaker will be Elder Harold B. Lee whom we sustained this morning as a member of the Council of the Twelve.

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The hour has come to open the One Hundred and Eleventh Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Heber J. Grant is present and presiding; he has asked President Clark to conduct the meeting.  
  
We are grateful to greet this great audience that promises to crowd to capacity the Tabernacle. Through the courtesy of Radio Station KSL and other Radio Stations cooperating the proceedings of this Conference will be broadcast over KFXD at Nampa; KSEI at Pocatello; KTFI at Twin Falls; KID at Idaho Falls; KSUB at Cedar City; and KEUB at Price. The Presidents of Stakes in these localities are arranging meetings in various of their Ward meeting houses where Ward and Stake congregations can hear the Conference. A direct wire from the Tabernacle to the Los Angeles Stake Tabernacle in Los Angeles, California will bring the services to that area.  
  
There are present on the stand this morning President Grant and his two Counselors, the eleven Apostles, all the First Presidents of Seventies, and also the Presiding Bishopric.  
  
The music is being furnished by the Brigham Young University Chorus and members of the Provo duo Stake Choirs. The directors are Doctors Franklin Madsen and Florence Madsen; organist, Elder Alexander Schreiner.

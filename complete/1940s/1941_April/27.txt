The moment has arrived for opening this the fourth session of this Conference. Notwithstanding we have a mild blizzard outside, this house is crowded to capacity. President Grant is resting this afternoon. President Clark is conducting the meeting.  
  
There are present on the stand this afternoon the two Counselors to President Grant, the eleven Apostles, all of the First Seven Presidents of Seventies, and all the Presiding Bishopric.

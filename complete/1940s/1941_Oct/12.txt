Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a great source of joy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you today and enjoy the spirit of the Conference. I pray that the power of the Holy Spirit may attend me in what I shall say, that I may say those things that are in harmony with the principles of the Gospel which we have espoused. I rejoice greatly in this conference. It is a great pleasure to be with you today, and to hear the fine testimonies that have been borne, the wonderful instructions that have been given by those who have spoken.  
  
I have been greatly impressed, especially by the testimony of President Heber J. Grant, a very remarkable testimony, it seems to me, that he has given to us today, and the work that he has accomplished. He is indeed a servant of the Lord, and has declared unto us the principles of truth which we have had occasion to espouse, and which we are attempting to carry out to the very best of our ability. I rejoice in all the things that have been said and done.  
  
EXPRESSES DESIRE TO LIVE THE GOSPEL  
  
I am with you, my brethren and sisters, in the observance of every principle of the Gospel, to the very best of my ability, in harmony with the purposes of the Lord. I desire, as far as it is in my power, to do my part for the advancement of this work. I rejoice with you today. I have a great desire to live the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its fulness, to the very best of my ability. I realize the fact that the Lord has given instructions so that we may understand and carry out in our lives these principles. I am heartily in accord with everything that has been said, every instruction that has been given to us.  
  
I endeavor, to the very best of my understanding and power, to live up to every commandment, every principle of the Gospel. I have great faith and testimony in every revelation the Lord has given to us. I appreciate the fact that the law of tithing is indeed a principle of promise and blessing, a principle that should bp fully espoused and carried out by the Latter-day Saints. My desire is to live the Gospel in every respect, to be careful and faithful in the observance of the principle of Fast offering, and everything that the Lord has made plain to us, because I am sure that every principle of the Gospel that the Lord has given is so easy to live, if we but have a desire and willingness to conform to it. We have no occasion to be backward or careless in the observance of these principles.  
  
TESTIMONY AS TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW OF TITHING  
  
I can state that the law of tithing is a very easy principle, in my opinion. I have never had any difficulty in observing that principle, because I know it is true. I know the blessings of the Lord accompany the observance of the principle of tithing. The Lord gives great blessings to every one who observes it, and I am sure that we, as a people, can appreciate the benefits and blessings that come to us by the observance of this principle and every other principle that the Lord has given, because they are intended for our welfare.  
  
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS OF THE GOSPEL BRINGS BLESSINGS  
  
I have never had the least difficulty in observing the Word of Wisdom. I realize that there are great blessings attached to the observance of that principle. The Lord desires us so to live that we may have His blessings continually, to walk in His paths, to live His laws. To live these principles is so easy, comparatively, and yet so important and so vital to our welfare and progress. Every member of the Church should be willing to observe these things readily, promptly and faithfully, and realize the blessings that follow the observance of these things.  
  
Now I desire to say to you again that in the matter of every other principle the Lord has given, I am desirous of living each principle. I have never had difficulty in observing them. I am trying to do that which the Lord has asked of us, as fully as possible, as faithfully as possible. I realize that these blessings are to be given to every Latter-day Saint and his family, and I have endeavored, to the very best of my ability, with my family, to live in harmony with the observance of all these principles.  
  
I have experienced great joy and satisfaction through the observance of these things to the very best of my ability. To Sister Cannon it has been a very easy thing to observe the principle of tithing, to fully observe it and carry it out, and she has had great blessings in doing it, also our children, every one of the family, who tries to do these things. We have endeavored to teach all of our children so they will realize the great blessings that will come to them through these things. Inasmuch as they will do right, the blessings of the Lord will attend them. These are eternal principles. They are divine, and are intended for our welfare and progress.  
  
RESTORATION OF THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD  
  
I would like to read to you a few words from section thirteen of the Doctrine and Covenants. In the beginning of the work which the Prophet Joseph Smith did, under instructions from the Lord, he was given the opportunity to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. We read, in the introduction to Section 13, of the ordination of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood, in Harmony, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, May 15th, 1829, under the hands of an angel, who announced himself as John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament. The angelic visitant averred that he was acting under the direction of Peter, James and John, the ancient Apostles who held the keys of the Higher Priesthood, which was called the Priesthood of Melchizedek.  
  
The promise was given to Joseph and Oliver that in due time the Priesthood of Melchizedek would be conferred upon them. John the Baptist conferred the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood upon these men in the following words:  
  
Upon you, my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.  
  
That great blessing was given to them at that time, and was followed by the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood.  
  
THE CHURCH ORGANIZED BY DIVINE INSTRUCTION  
  
In the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants the following revelation was given to the brethren:  
  
"Revelation on Church Government, given through Joseph the Prophet, in April, 1830."  
  
Preceding the giving of this revelation the Prophet wrote:  
  
We obtained of Him (Jesus Christ) the following, by the spirit of prophecy and revelation, which not only gave us much information, but also pointed out to us the precise day upon which, according to His will and commandment, we should proceed to organize His Church once more here upon the earth.  
  
The Lord again attested the genuineness of the Book of Mormon. He gives commandments respecting baptism. We find descriptions of duties of the special officers of the Priesthood, the mode of baptism, the keeping of records of the Church. The revelation begins with the following words:  
  
The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April —  
  
Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Junior, who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first Elder of this Church;  
  
And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of God, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second Elder of this Church, and ordained under his hand;  
  
And this according to the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both now and forever. Amen. 
 
After it was truly manifested unto this first Elder that he had received a remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world;  
  
But after repenting, and humbling himself sincerely, through faith, God ministered unto him by an holy angel, whose countenance was as lightning, and whose garments were pure and white above all other whiteness;  
  
And gave unto him commandments which inspired him;  
  
And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate the Book of Mormon,  
  
Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also,  
  
Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is declared unto the world by them —  
  
Proving to the world that the Holy Scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old,  
  
Thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today and forever. Amen.  
  
Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them shall the world be judged, even as many as shall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work;  
  
And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal life;  
  
But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn to their own condemnation — 
 
For the Lord God has spoken it; and we, the elders of the Church, have heard and bear witness to the words of the glorious Majesty on high, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.  
  
By these things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;  
  
And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them; 
  
And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.  
  
But by the transgression of these holy laws, man became sensual and devilish, and became fallen man.  
  
Wherefore the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son, as it is written in those scriptures which have been given of him.  
  
He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them;  
  
He was crucified, died, and rose again the third day;  
  
And ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father.  
  
That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end, should be saved.  
  
That leads to a revelation given in a section, where some very important instructions are given.  
 
REVELATION GIVEN IN LIBRARY JAIL 
  
Brethren and sisters, I would like to read to you from a revelation given by the Lord in the hundred and twenty-first section. It is called "A Prayer and Prophecies, written by Joseph the Seer, while in Liberty Jail, Clay County, Missouri, March 20th, 1839," where he was suffering terrible experiences, and where he had to endure many hardships, many indignities. He was true and faithful through it all, and he received many instructions at that time, which are of great concern to the Latter-day Saints and all those who have in their hearts a love of truth, justice, freedom and righteousness. Let me read you part of that section:  
  
A Prayer and Prophecies written by Joseph Smith, the prophet, while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri, dated March 20th, 1839.  
  
The Prophet with several companions had been months in prison. Their petitions and appeals directed to the executive officers and the judiciary had failed to bring them relief. Fervent appeals to the Lord in behalf of the suffering Saiints — The curse of the Lord to fall upon those who contend against His will — Men though called may not be chosen — The rights of the Priesthood inseparably connected with the powers of heaveen — Unrighteous exercise of the powers of the Priesthood leads to apostasy — Powers of the Priesthood to be exercised in justice and mercy.  
  
O God; where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?  
  
How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people, and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?  
  
Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?  
  
O Lord God Almighty, Maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol — stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us;  
  
Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword avenge us of our wrongs. 
  
Remember thy suffering saints, O our God! and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever.  
  
My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;  
  
And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes;  
  
Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.  
  
Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job;  
  
And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun;  
  
And also that God hath set to his hand and seal to change the times and seasons, and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous workings; that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness;  
  
Also, because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon themselves, to the very uttermost;  
  
That they may be disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off;  
  
And not many years hence, that they and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall.  
  
Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I command them.  
  
But those who cry transgression, do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.  
  
And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring them into bondage, and death—  
  
Woe unto them, because they have offended my little ones, they shall be severed from the ordinances of mine house.  
  
Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them.  
  
They shall not have right to the Priesthood, nor their posterity after them, from generation to generation.  
  
It had been better for them that a millstone had been hanged about their necks, and they drowned in the depth of the sea.  
  
Woe unto all those that discomfort my people, and drive, and murder, and testify against them, saith the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall not escape the damnation of hell.  
  
Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all;  
  
For there is a time appointed for every man, according as his works shall be.  
  
God shall give unto you (the saints) knowledge, by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was, until now;  
  
Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to, by the angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory.  
  
A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many Gods, they shall be manifest.  
  
All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
   
A number of things more were said in the section.  
 
I will read a little further:  
  
How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri River in its decreed course, or to turn it up-stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.  
  
Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?  
  
Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson —  
  
That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.  
  
That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the Priesthood or the authority of that man.  
  
Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.  
  
We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.  
  
Hence many are called, but few are chosen.  
  
No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, and by love unfeigned;  
  
By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile. . . .  
  
Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.  
  
The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee for ever and ever.  
  
My brethren and sisters, I testify to you that the instructions given are of very great concern to us all. Latter-day Saints, they are as important as they were when they were first given. They are of great interest, just as much as they were when the revelation was first given.  
  
I pray the blessings of the Lord to be with you, and His choice mercy to attend us all, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

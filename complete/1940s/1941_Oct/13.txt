Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

We should like to hear from Elder Hilton A. Robertson, former President of the Japanese Mission. He was recently in the hospital. We hope he has sufficiently recovered; and if he is in the audience will he please come forward and occupy one of these seats on the platform, near the pulpit. He performed an excellent mission in reopening the Japanese Mission, and we have not heard his report since he returned home.

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

We shall now be favored with another selection from the Pasadena Stake Male Quartet. You will perhaps be interested to know that this quartet is made up of Brother George Waite, first tenor, from Eastmont Ward; Brother Monte Green, baritone, from the Montibello Ward; Brother Geert Hulshoff, basso, of Belvedere Ward; Albert Gish, second tenor, Monrovia Ward. All are High Priests in Pasadena Stake. They call the quartet Melkomen, which contains, you will recognize, the first syllable of the Melchizedek Priesthood. The brethren will now sing for us, "The Story of Old," by Parks; director, Brother A. M. Gish.

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

We are pleased to announce the presence of President Heber J. Grant at this session. The exercises will be conducted under his presidency and supervision.  
 
Yesterday, when the list of those who have passed away was read, one name was omitted because her demise took place after the list was made up. I very sorrowfully announce the passing of Sister Joseph F. Merrill, beloved wife of Elder Joseph F. Merrill of the Council of the Twelve. She passed away Monday, September 29, 1941. Our hearts beat as one in sympathy with our fellow-worker in his bereavement. 
  
So far as I can observe, all the General Authorities who are in the city are present on the stand in their places this morning.

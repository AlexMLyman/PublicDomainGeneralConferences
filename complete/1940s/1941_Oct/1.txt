Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

At the request of President Grant, who is presiding on this occasion, and also President Clark, I now announce the opening of the 112th Semi-Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I know that I express your feelings and the loving sentiments of the entire Church when I say that we are thankful and grateful that President Grant has sufficiently recovered from his recent illness to be present at this Conference.  
  
All official meetings are announced in the Conference Folder. Copies of the Folder are obtainable at the Tabernacle entrances, and all persons interested are requested to provide themselves with a copy and become acquainted with the announcements therein contained.  
  
Notice of all unofficial gatherings will be given in the Deseret News.  
  
Through the courtesy of Radio Station KSL, the proceedings of this Conference are being broadcast. It will be necessary, therefore, to make some announcements which to you who are present might seem unimportant or non-essential.  
  
There are present on the stand this morning President Grant and his two Counselors, all the members of the Council of the Twelve, all the Assistants to the Twelve, six of the First Council of the Seventy, and all the Presiding Bishopric.

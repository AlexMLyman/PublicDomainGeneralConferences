Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

Due to the inclemency of the weather President Grant has considered it advisable not to come down to the session this morning, but in all probability he will be with us this afternoon.  
  
There are on the stand the Counselors in the First Presidency, the Twelve Apostles of the Church, the Assistants to the Twelve, six of the First Council of the Seventy, and all of the Presiding Bishopric.  
  
The Tabernacle is crowded to capacity, people standing in the aisles, the galleries, and the doorways, and we are informed that the Assembly Hall is also filled with an overflow meeting.

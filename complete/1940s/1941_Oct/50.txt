Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

Several months ago I stood at President Grant's bedside when he lay in the hospital in Los Angeles. When I think how far he has come since that time on the road to recovery, I am deeply grateful at this moment to be able to announce that he is here, and will give us instructions and blessings at the conclusion of this great Conference.

My brethren and sisters: We are all thrilled with this message from President Grant. I saw him personally, as did Brother McKay. He is recovering; he is well on his way to full recovery. I know that every true Latter-day Saint in Zion is praying for his speedy and complete restoration to health and strength. We should like to send him now the greetings of this great Conference, and assure him that he has our faith and prayers for his early recovery.

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I feel that I owe an apology to the other brethren because our trouble here runs back to the beginning; I talked too much the first day. So Brother Jacobs of the Palestine-Syrian Mission, Brother A. Richard Peterson of the Norwegian Mission, and later, Brother John A. Israelson of the Norwegian Mission, we shall hear from you next time.  
  
I might say just a word myself. I wish sincerely to thank the brethren and sisters for the prayers which they have offered up in my behalf. Only the Lord Himself knows how much I needed help. This has been my first experience, I hope it is my last. I am grateful for the Spirit of the Lord that has been with us. I am grateful for the blessings that have come from the testimonies of the brethren who have spoken, and grateful that we have been able to let President Grant hear this great Conference.  
  
I also leave my testimony with you of the truth of this great work in which we are engaged. I ask God to bless us always, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

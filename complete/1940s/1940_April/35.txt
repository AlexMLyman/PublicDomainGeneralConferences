Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I do not know how well you know it, but it takes a really strong constitution to stand what some of us have stood, expecting it, but not knowing how soon it would come. I have learned this much in my experience in the Church — I learned it only a couple of hours ago — that the Spirit of the Lord does not stay in a meeting too long, especially around twelve o'clock. I would not attempt by any means to do this job all alone.  
  
A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT MCKAY  
  
I am thankful from the bottom of my heart, as are you, to hear the testimony again of President McKay. I went on a mission to the same land as did he. I know how the people in that Mission loved him and I know the people of this Church love him in the same degree as do the Scotch people. May the Lord lengthen his days that he may be an inspiration to all of us for years to come.  
  
SUSTAINING OUR LEADERS  
  
May the Lord bless all of our leaders. May we have the good sense always to pray for them and, better than pray for them, let us sustain them in the way we should; I ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

President Clark: We are pleased and I am sure we shall be enheartened by a message which has just come from President Heber J. Grant, which I shall read:  
  
Los Angeles, April 7, 1940  
  
Presidents J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and David O. McKay,  
 
Care Mormon Conference, Salt Lake Tabernacle,  
 
Salt Lake City, Utah.  
  
I cannot adequately express the joy that came from listening in on this morning's session of Conference. It came through wonderfully clear and was a spiritual feast in which many friends here joined. I was especially pleased that President McKay was able to speak with such ease. I am looking forward with great anticipation to this afternoon's session in which I shall join with you in spirit. I am feeling fine today and improving some every day. Please convey again to the Saints my love and blessings.  
  
HEBER J. GRANT.

The world has made much advance in mechanical things, during our recorded race history. It has made relatively small advance in spiritual things. Your fathers in a marvelous pioneer pilgrimage came into this valley, and with their hands builded here a perfect temple, that the souls might open in this temple towards the spiritual power, and, perhaps, in larger and larger measure, be imbued with that power from above. It is my belief and strong hope that in the years just ahead men are going to illuminate life in spiritual terms; that just as they have, within these twenty-five years, on the mechanical side, touched that marvelous thing we call radium and learned that it gives fifty million times the energy of other substances science has been handling, so there lies within us, if we will but open our souls and receive the endowment that freely has always been offered, many, many, many times the spirit power men have known. My impress from the hours I have had in your city is that this people are holding their souls open, and the great Giver of life and power will answer their prayers.

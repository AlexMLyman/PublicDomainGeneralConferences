ANNOUNCING A MEETING OF TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS 

This is certainly a very wonderful audience for such a stormy day. We feel grateful because of the desire on the part of the Latter-day Saints to attend their meetings â€” that we have this wonderful audience. If a person has a journey of two hundred miles to travel, and, at the end of that time, finds that he must go another fifty, it makes him very tired indeed, but if he starts out for two hundred fifty miles to begin with, he is not weary or worn out when he arrives at the end. Usually, we are here two hours but we are going to make it two and a-half today. I thought if I gave you fair notice, you would not be so fidgety as you otherwise would.

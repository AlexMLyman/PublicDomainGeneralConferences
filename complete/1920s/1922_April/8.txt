These gentlemen have another appointment. We will pardon them if they say goodby. We are very grateful for the very spledid complimentary things they have said of us, and we hope that we will have the pleasure of welcoming them back here at no far distant date; and certainly I hope that I may, some day, have the privilege of meeting these people in their own homes.

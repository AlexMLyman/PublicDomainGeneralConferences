A DELEGATION FROM JAPAN 

I am reminded, by a little note from Elder Junius F. Wells, that fifty years ago, February, 1872, a large delegation from Japan, headed by Prince Sionii Tomomi Iwakura, Marquis Ito, and other eminent Japanese officials, were snow-bound in our great city. We have here today a delegation from Japan, and we welcome them with another snow storm, which is rather unusual. The above embassy was detained here for about three weeks. The Territorial Legislature was in session at the time and they were extended many courtesies by the Mayor, City Council, the Territorial and military officials, and they visited this tabernacle and heard the great organ played upon by Elder Ridges, its builder. Here they had their first glimpse of the pioneer work accomplished by the people of Utah, and the great West in twenty-five years. They obtained statistics regarding the development and colonization of our beloved country, and studied its government in our city. It fell to my lot to have the honor of being called upon a mission to Japan and open the way there for the spread of the gospel, as believed in by the Latter-day Saints. I am very glad, indeed, upon this occasion, to welcome some of my friends from Japan. 

We also have with us today, as visitors, several members of the General Staff of the American Army.

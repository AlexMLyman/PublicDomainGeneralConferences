I never expected to have such an honor as this in my life. I have been in this community a number of times and I have frequently thought that here was the best place in the world to study the science and the art of nation-building in the field. My subject is Political Economy, sometimes called the science of statesmanship. Some things pertaining to this subject we can get out of books, but it seems to me that here is the one place in the world where we can see in operation, in the field itself, the processes going on under which a great nation is built. If "By their fruits ye shall know them," as your President has said, the "Mormons" must be a great people, for their fruits are good. I have not only been impressed, in several visits, by what is to be seen in this immediate neighborhood. It has also been my privilege to visit some of the smaller communities in the southern part of the state and some in central Idaho; and in the small communities, as well as in the large, I have seen in operation the science and the art of community-building, which is nation-building in miniature, and everywhere it has my unbounded admiration. 

I did not know what I was going to say when I got up. I have often had this in my mind, and I am very glad, now that it is over with, that I have had the opportunity of saying it. Though I was very much scared at first, I am very glad that I have had the privilege of saying what I have often thought.

We have a long list of the general boards of the Sunday School, the Mutual Improvement Association, the Relief Society, and other auxiliary institutions, but inasmuch as these institutions hold their regular annual conferences, we will dispense with the reading of all the names in the future at our general conferences, and only read the names of the presiding officers and sustain the general boards with them, without reading all those names.

We are honored with the presence this morning of Professor Thomas Nixon Carver, of Harvard University, President Walter Ernest Clark, of the University of Nevada, and President Charles A. Lory, of the Colorado Agricultural College. I am sure we will be delighted to hear a few words from these gentlemen.

It is certainly very gratifying to see this building filled to overflowing with people, many standing in the aisles and the doorways. We have never before had such an attendance upon a week day at any of our conferences as we had yesterday and as we are having today. Amplifiers have been installed in the Assembly Hall, so that those who do not have seats here, and would like to go over there, can be comfortably seated, and hear whatever is said in this building.

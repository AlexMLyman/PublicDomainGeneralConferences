Of the General Authorities of the Church, there are absent from our conference Elders Reed Smoot, David O. McKay, John A. Widtsoe, and George Albert Smith, of the Council of the Twelve. As you all know, Brother Smoot's duties prevent his attendance. We had hoped Brother Widtsoe might be here, but the Commission of which he is a member demands his attention, and he has written his sincere regrets for not being present at the conference. We have a cablegram from Pres. David O. McKay, that "the conference presidents of the mission in special assembly send greetings to the First Presidency and other authorities and the Church at home. God bless you." Brother George Albert Smith is absent on account of sickness. We hope he will be with us before the conference is concluded.

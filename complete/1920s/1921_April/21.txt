The congested condition existing upon this block at this time is but typical of the congested condition in the Church It seems impossible to provide meetinghouses enough, or room within the walls sufficient, to accommodate the Latter-day Saints in their assemblies. There is, without doubt, a great spiritual revival amongst the people; and in this we all rejoice. Besides this gathering at this hour, there is an open-air meeting in progress on the grounds, and also the main assembly in the great tabernacle.

When the brethren of the Twelve go out amongst the people they have, of course, very close and cordial dealings with the stake presidencies, but we have one little criticism to offer that I think may well be voiced here. It is somewhat difficult to get one of the stake presidents to say much when one of the Council of the Twelve is present. I want these brethren to understand that they are the visiting brethren on this occasion, and I want them to do just as we have to do when visiting their stakes. And I pray that they may be inspired by the Spirit of the Lord, for I know you will be edified by what they have to say.

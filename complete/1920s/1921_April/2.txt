Music

I feel grateful to the Lord for the inspiration of his Spirit to so many of our people in the writing of the beautiful music that we have for our hymns, and for selections such as this that we have just listened to. May God bless our composers and our poets who have given us such inspired words and such inspiring, sweet music.

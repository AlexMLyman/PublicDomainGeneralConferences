I feel gratified for the very splendid compliments that have been paid to our people by the previous speaker, and on behalf of the Saints here we thank him, particularly for the words of praise that he has spoken regarding us, away from Salt Lake City. I feel, as he has said, that we are coming into our own. It was like an oasis in the desert, a few years ago, to find anybody who was willing to say anything good about the "Mormons;" but some of the finest and most energetic and most faithful men in all America today, educationally and in other lines, are beginning to say good things of the Latter-day Saints. I want to say to Professor Holden that the Latter-day Saints sang "Come, come, ye Saints," as they crossed the plains, with all their hearts and with all their souls, feeling every word of the lines: 

"And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 

We then are free from toil, and sorrow too, 

With the just we shall dwell," 

The young men and the young women of the "Mormon" Church who live up to the principles of their fathers, are as loyal and as determined and as willing to sacrifice today as were their fathers, their grandfathers, and their great grandfathers, for that which we know and proclaim to all the world to be, in very deed, the plan of life and salvation, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.

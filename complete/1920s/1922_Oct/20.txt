The evidence of the "decline" (?) of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is seen in this vast audience. When I was one of the junior members of the Council of the Twelve, we never held an overflow meeting Sunday morning, because this building held all of the people. Today the Assembly Hall is crowded to overflowing; people are standing here, and we have an overflow meeting on the grounds in front of the Bureau of Information, because the assembly hall in that building will not hold the Saints. I am informed there are three thousand people on the outside.

I do not know how successful I shall be in making you hear me. I have not had very much opportunity as yet to do outdoor speaking, and particularly to such a throng of people as is assembled here today. I am grateful for this opportunity, my friends, brethren and sisters, although it makes me feel a good deal like the story that Brother George H. Brimhall tells of two fellows who were going into the battle. They were both trembling a good deal, and one of them, who was in the rear, said, "Say, you seem to be awful scared there in front," and the fellow in front said, "If you were half as scared as I am, you would be five miles in the rear and running like — well." And I want to say, brethren and sisters, that sometimes in the timidity of our souls we fail to live up to the things that we know.  

As has been announced to you, I have the honor of presiding over the Northwestern States mission; I have the honor of being temporarily a parent to your boys and girls. I wish we had more of them. I want to say to you that no sweeter, no finer specimens of boyhood and girlhood can be found in all the broad confines of the earth. They are indeed the salt of the earth. And we are endeavoring to teach them the things that are vital, and they are learning them with a rapidity that is almost startling. We have boys and girls come out into the field who unhappily have had but little teaching at home. I do not say that it is the fault of the parents or of the bishop of the ward or of any of those who have charge of the spiritual education of our boys and girls, but the fact is that at whose ever door it may be laid, they are almost unacquainted with the principles of the religion to which their parents have given their unbounded allegiance. It is marvelous how rapidly they acquire a knowledge of the gospel. It seems to be as natural to them to understand faith, repentance, baptism, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost — the first principles of the gospel — as it is to breathe. 

We are endeavoring, brethren and sisters, in the teaching of your boys and girls, to make of them good citizens, not only of the Government, but also of the Church; and, as was said yesterday here in the tabernacle by Dr. Widtsoe, the one thing lacking in the education of all people, with few exceptions, is they have not been taught spirituality. We do study the physical; we give great attention and spend almost unbounded treasure on the cultivation of the mental, but the spiritual is almost wholly neglected. We are endeavoring, during their tenure of missionary service, to give them an understanding of the spiritual. 

And what will this spiritual acquisition do for them that the physical and the mental does not accomplish? These boys and girls have been taught in the schools that they should observe certain lines of conduct, largely for the purpose that they may acquire substance. Our whole educational system has for its object the teaching of boys and girls how to acquire material things. When these boys and girls go into the mission, they are brought into a new atmosphere. There are new channels of communication between them and nature that are opened up of which hitherto they had no conception. And those channels are of the most highly developing character, because they give the boys and girls a view of life they had not previously had, and that no men or women can have without having the experience that comes to the missionary. That experience, to my mind and with the thought I have given the subject, is one of the most useful and necessary of anything of which I have conception, for the reason that it gives the boys and girls a foundation upon which to build their future, that they cannot acquire in any other way. 

We have labored, my friends, to give our boys and girls a large patrimony, when we shall have passed on into the great eternity. No matter how hard we may strive, no matter what we may leave them, we are placing in their hands, in many instances wholly inexperienced, the opportunity of ruination. But when you have sent a boy or girl into the mission field, you have sent them into a school for the acquiring of that which is more useful, more necessary, and will be to them what no material possession can possibly furnish; for you have taught the boy or girl, or they have acquired, a faith in God, the faith that Brother Jenson has been speaking of. Do you know of anything that is more desirable in its possession than faith in God? It is the thing, as has been said, that the world lacks; and if you can give your boys and your girls faith in God, you have supplied them with that which no patrimony, no matter how generous, can possibly confer upon them; because the patrimony is a thing that moths may eat, that rust may corrupt, that thieves may steal; but when you have given them faith in God, or an opportunity to obtain it, you have given them that which nothing earthly can deprive them of, and it will go with them into the eternities. 

We have had boys and girls come out there — I have seen them, although I have been there but a short time — who have been uneducated in the things of the gospel. But send them out without purse or scrip, to do what we term summer work, and they will be gone a couple or three months, and when they come back, note the difference in the appearance of the boy or the girl! Their whole being has undergone a complete change. They are no more like the boy or girl they were when they came out than if they were two different beings entirely. They come back with a faith in God. And when they stand up, you know that they have a faith in him. You can see it in their countenances; you can feel it in the clasp of their hand; you can hear it as the words roll from their lips, as the tears stream from their eyes in their gratitude to God, who has preserved them and blessed them and given them a testimony that he lives, that he hears and answers prayers, that he is indeed our Father. And if you give your boys and girls an opportunity to acquire that faith, you have given them something that you cannot possibly confer if you leave them no matter what treasure of an earthly character. 

Now, we need missionaries. This has been my preface to the statement that we need missionaries, and we need them very badly. I know of instances where there are boys and girls in the mission field who are being supported in some instances by widowed mothers and those mothers have said to me, "I do not see how I can possibly keep my daughter in the mission field, because our crops have no value; it won't pay to dig our potatoes; I have no means of supporting her except that which I borrow and which I must look to her to help me to make good when she returns." That is faith, a living faith, because of the desire to have that daughter acquire this thing to which I have referred, faith in God. My confidence in this community is of a character that if they knew that here is a girl in the mission field, or a boy, or any number of them, who need and who are being supported by widowed mothers, there are men and women who, if they knew those facts, would say, "We will support them until their mission is concluded." They are out there looking for, searching for, combing society for honest souls, and if, as the scripture says, our joy shall be great with one soul whom we shall bring to repentance, how much greater will that joy be if we shall bring many in the presence of our Father — now, if our joy is to be great with one soul or any number of souls, so also great will be our joy if we contribute to the maintaining of these boys and girls who are without means, to help them finish their missions. And I believe that some movement will be started in the communities, by which a fund may be established, so that these boys and girls can be kept in the mission field. I know that you have no accurate idea of the value of those boys and girls in your communities after they return if they keep the spirit of the mission in their hearts. 

I want to appeal to the parents in this congregation and the parents throughout all Israel: If you want to give your boys and girls something that will be vital and lasting, give them the opportunity of a mission, and you will have conferred upon them that which you cannot possibly bestow in any other way. They are beautiful in the lives they lead, and the men and women who see them going about their daily toil have remarked to me when they have known that I am a Latter-day Saint, as they have seen them standing on the streets preaching the gospel of repentance, that never have they seen finer specimens of boys and girls, who radiate more intelligence, and to whom it has been a greater delight to listen and to know than these, your boys and girls, who are doing service in the mission field. It is a beautiful, a valuable thing, and will be of eternal use to them if you will give them an opportunity of enjoying it. 

And I want to say that we are endeavoring to teach them this great fact, that wherever they are, no matter at what time nor under what circumstances, they are always missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Are you? That is what your boys and girls will ask you: Are you missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Are you willing to do the things that they are doing? Are you willing to follow in the footsteps of these beautiful boys and girls, who are teaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? Do you teach it? That is a question for you to ask yourselves. They are teaching it. Are you teaching it? You can be of vast use in this Church if you will teach the gospel. Primarily you have no other business in this world than to teach the gospel that God has revealed for the salvation of his children; and if you will analyze your lives, analyze the object of your being here, you will conclude that you are here for the purpose of furthering his interests in the earth among his children; and I commend to you the suggestion that as you have opportunity, give your boys and girls the chance of a mission. You will never regret it; it will stand eternally to your credit; because you will have saved your boys and your girls, than whom there is nothing more precious in all the earth. That God will help us to understand and appreciate our opportunities, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

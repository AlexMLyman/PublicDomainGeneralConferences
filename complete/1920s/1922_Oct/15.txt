Brother McKay has been chosen to preside over the European Mission. Elder Whitney, the only one of the twenty-six General Authorities who is absent from us today, has undergone a serious operation, and on account of his weak condition he has been released to return home as soon as his health will permit. I am very pleased to announce to this audience that our last word from him is that he has left the nurses' home, that the wound has closed up, and that he is on the high road to recovery.

Missionary work

I am glad, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity of attending this conference. My soul has been made to rejoice in listening to the splendid counsels that have been imparted, and in hearing the testimonies that have been delivered concerning the wonderful work of the Lord. It falls to my lot, at the present time, to labor in the California mission. California, as you all know, is a state of considerable renown. There are things transpiring there that perhaps do not occur anywhere else in the world, as far as I know. There are a great many people in California who are there for pleasure, who have come from other sections of the nation, and from other nations, in order to enjoy the wonderful climate of California, and to spend the money that they gathered together. It is a common thing in Southern California for Canadian people to hold a reunion, and people who are from New York, and from Iowa, and from Illinois, and practically all of the other states of the Union; they come together in large numbers. It is astonishing at times, to note the number who congregate in these various reunions from other nations and states in the United States. I do not know whether anything of this character is found elsewhere in the nation or not. 

I think there is a general feeling that the people of California are not seeking for religion. Nevertheless, I am very happy to be able to report that there are many very excellent people in the State of California, and that many of them give the missionaries opportunity to expound the principles of the gospel which they have been sent to teach; and there are a few who are convinced of the truth of that message, who yield obedience to the doctrines and become identified with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are many people of our own faith who appear to be attracted to that state, and we are receiving hundreds of men and women who come from the various wards and stakes here in Zion to identify themselves with the branches of the Church that are located in California. We have some very excellent Latter-day Saints, just as good as can be found in any other part of the Church or in any other mission, men and women who are devoted to the service of the Lord, who feel that they are under obligation to live the principles of the gospel and to convince others, by the example they set, they have indeed received the truth; men and women who are that willing to give their time for the building up of the Church and for the strengthening of the organizations that have been effected in various parts of the mission. In fact, there is a spirit, in connection with missionary work, which seems to seize hold of many people who have been indifferent to their religious duties here in the wards at home, and they become aroused to the necessity of devoting a little of their time to the service of God and the advancement of his work. We have had the joy of seeing a good many who formerly have been quite careless and neglectful, turn their attention to the work of God and render special service in advancing our Master's interests. I am very glad to be able to report that we have a corps of missionaries who are interested in preaching the gospel, and who, notwithstanding they feel weak, are bearing testimony, to the truth as it has been revealed; and even in California, the power of God is made manifest. 

Just a few weeks ago, a telephone message was received, answered by a young elder of just a few months' experience. A person desired to know if he could be administered to. He was not a member of the Church, but expressed a belief in the truths of the gospel as it has been taught by the missionaries. He was informed that if he had faith to believe that God, our Father in heaven, would hear and answer the prayers of his servants, there would be no objection to his coming to receive the healing ordinance. He came into the office on crutches, and two young boys, in the fear of God, anointed him with holy oil, and laid their hands upon him. They rebuked the trouble that had been preying upon him for a long period of time, and when the ordinance was completed and one of those elders took his crutches and offered them to the man, he looked up into his face, smiled, and said: "My brother, you don't know what has taken place. I am healed!" He walked from the building without his crutches; and, on the following day he accompanied the missionaries on a ten-block walk to show them the residence of a person they were seeking; and he has continued free from the ailment that held him down for a long time. 

So that, God is in California, notwithstanding its pleasures, and the fact that there are tens of thousands of people who think little of him, and who are not seeking for religion. There are other men who love the Lord, who are willing to listen to the testimonies borne by his servants, who hearken to the doctrines that are expounded, who are going to believe by the power of God and the Holy Ghost that they come in contact with the truth, who have the courage, even in pleasure-seeking California, to cast their lot with the people of God, and to give of their time and their substance that the purposes of God may be accomplished. 

In California, in this time of stress, we have asked the people to think of the missionaries. I would like to say to the fathers and mothers, here at home and in that mission, that Latter-day Saints have responded quite liberally and have contributed of their means, that others who were in distressed financial conditions might be aided, and possibly prevented from returning home. I am glad to say that we have missionaries today who are faithfully pursuing their labors, who have been preserved in the mission field by the faith and liberality of the Latter-day Saints who are in California; for, in every conference of the California mission, there are people who have contributed of their substance, that they might help the missionaries, that none of them should return home before their labors are completed. Of course, they have not been able to prevent some of the missionaries from returning; but they are helping, according to their substance, to provide for them. 

I suppose it is natural, when one is engaged in missionary work, that he feels that the important thing, as announced in this conference, is the message that has been delivered by President Heber J. Grant in relation to missionary work. I hope fathers and mothers will take to their hearts the message as it has fallen from the lips of the prophet of the Lord. I think there is very great necessity for such a message. I have never before come in contact with a spirit like the spirit which prevails in some sections, at the present time â€” the spirit of the missionaries and some fathers and mothers, that they know when their sons and daughters should be released from the mission field. I have had considerable experience in the mission field and I have never before come in contact, in any other missionary labor, with a spirit of this sort. I know what my own feelings were and the feelings of my companions, in my early missionary experience. Why, we would have died in the mission field before we would have suggested to the mission president that we ought to be released to return home. I myself have recommended men to be released because of ill health, when I have had fear in my heart that they would lay their bodies down in a foreign land, and they have pleaded, in tears, that they might be permitted to remain in the mission field. They had an absolute feeling of opposition to such a release, and a determination to remain and fulfil the mission to which they had been appointed. I have had men, right on this temple block, almost command me as the president of the California mission, to release their sons to return home. I have received letters from fathers, from various sections, intimating that they will no longer provide the means to sustain their sons in the mission field. I recognize the fact that we do live in strenuous times, that fathers and mothers are having great difficulty to provide the necessary means to meet the expenses of their missionary sons and daughters, but I do not believe that it is the right or the prerogative of any father to write to the mission president demanding the release of his son or daughter. I believe the proper course to pursue is to confer with the authorities at home, those who know the conditions and circumstances, and if it be necessary for them to be called from the missionary field, let them be called because of recommendations that have been made by the bishops, or stake presidents, who are familiar with all the circumstances. There is no desire to hold men in the missionary field to the injury of fathers and mothers; but there is a desire, a strong desire, that when the Lord God Almighty has touched the souls of young men, has made them know the truth, and has fired them with a desire to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall be given the opportunity, and not be called home to their sorrow and disappointment, and to the weakening of their own faith. I would that the men of Israel might sense the obligation that rests upon them in relation to the preaching of the gospel. It is not only the call of the president of the Church, but, as he quoted from the Scriptures, it is the call of God. He that is warned, let him warn his neighbor. When I think of the great hosts of men who have been specially ordained as witnesses of the Lord, Jesus Christ, men of power, men of experience, men of capacity, and not one of them in the missionary field, I do not think that a very extravagant statement. 

There are only boys in the mission field, boys in their teens. You men of thirty years of age, forty years of age, filled with physical power, and the power of God, is there not responsibility upon you in relation to the preaching of the gospel? I think there is, and I think it ought to be possible, in the midst of the hosts of men who have this experience and ability, for a few of them to be standing by the side of the boys and girls who manifest their faith and their willingness to preach the gospel of the Redeemer. I thank God that notwithstanding their feeling of weakness, wonderful development takes place among these young men and women. I thank God that the boys and girls in the mission field have been made to know the truth of the gospel just as thoroughly as their fathers and mothers know it, by the experience that has come to them as preachers of righteousness. We ask for help, I wonder if there is any mission president who could say, when one of his missionaries found financial difficulty, that a bishop has felt that responsibility was upon the community that he represented, and that the people have been called upon to contribute a little of their means, that their boy or girl might preach the gospel? There are many of that kind, I fear, but I believe this responsibility is upon every ward, and upon every stake; and that, notwithstanding financial stress, there are means in the land to provide for missionaries, if the people have the disposition. I think this disposition should be cultivated, that the gospel message might be carried to the people, that repentance may be called among the people, and men and women may be invited to the waters of baptism, to receive, by the holy ordinance, the remission of their sins, and by the laying on of hands, be brought in communication with the Holy Ghost and receive from God our Father a knowledge of the truth as it has been revealed. 

That is your business just as much as it it my business. I happen to be in the mission field today; it may be your turn tomorrow. All of us should be lending assistance, that our skirts may be free from the blood of our fellow men. I thank God for the gospel. I rejoice in preaching it. I am glad to be a missionary. I am proud of my associates. I am glad to bring to fathers and mothers the glad news that their sons and daughters love the truth, and that they comprehend, measurably, the great plan of salvation. I bear record to the work of God, to the power of God. I bear record of the truth of the promises of God, in relation to the development of his purposes and the triumph of his work. God help us all to do this, for ever and for ever, and be found at the post of duty by night and by day, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I really believe that this is the largest gathering I have ever seen in this Tabernacle of a Sunday morning. I am told that the Assembly Hall is full and running over, and that there are several hundred people still standing up. It will therefore be necessary to hold an overflow meeting.

In announcing the hymn, "When dark and drear the skies appear," President Grant remarked: The words of this very splendid hymn are by Sister Emily Hill Woodmansee, the music by our late organist, Joseph. J. Daynes. No person that I ever knew, lived more perfectly in keeping with these beautiful words than the good sister who wrote them. She came to this country, dragging a hand cart all the way from the Missouri River to the Salt Lake Valley. She lived and died one of the true and faithful Latter-day Saints. She has written some of the most inspiring of the many inspiring hymns that we have in our hymnbook.

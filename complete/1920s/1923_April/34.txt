The following note was read by President Heber J. Grant, after explaining that Brother Smith went out to ascertain how the crowd in front of the Bureau of Information was hearing while President Ivins was speaking: 

President Ivins is being heard by about four thousand people as plainly as you are hearing him. His voice carries to the Valley House corner, but you can't catch the words. â€” George Albert Smith. 

I have a note from President Edward J. Wood, announcing that he was detained on account of a storm and railroad accident. For Brother Wood's benefit I will say that we started at the head of the list of stakes and have heard from about one-third of all the stake presidents, each talking ten minutes. 

We will now hear from Brother Wood for ten minutes.

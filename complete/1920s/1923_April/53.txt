AUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS 

The Officers and General Board members of the Auxiliary Organizations — the Relief Society, the Deseret Sunday School Union, the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary Association — were unanimously sustained as at present constituted. 

We regret that the state of Brother Orson F. Whitney's health is such that he has not been able to be with us during this conference. We are delighted to announce that he has very greatly improved since his return from Great Britain, and we hope that in the near future he will be able to take up actively his labors among the people. 

We regret also the absence of Brother Reed Smoot from this conference. He came from Washington, hoping to be present with us at the conference meetings, but he was called back on important business pertaining to our country. We are all proud of the very splendid and wonderful record that he is making at the Capitol. 

Elder Andrew Jenson, one of our Assistant Church Historians, is on a vacation and has gone on a visit to South America. He is at this time on top of the Andes. He wanted to be kindly remembered to the good people at this conference.

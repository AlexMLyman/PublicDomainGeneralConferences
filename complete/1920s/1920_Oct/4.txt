I am grateful beyond expression that President Penrose has been able to speak to us. He has been at home, sick abed, most of the time during the last week. 

I will state that a general music committee has been selected, and will undoubtedly be sustained at our conference, with Elder Melvin J. Ballard as the head of that committee.

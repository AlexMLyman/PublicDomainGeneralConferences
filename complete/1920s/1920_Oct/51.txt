Before the close of this conference I desire to express to our heavenly Father, on behalf of myself and associates, the deep gratitude of our hearts for the rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit that has been with all those who have addressed the conference since the first opening remarks. I pray God to bless the Latter-day Saints, to fill their hearts full of charity and love and long-suffering, to give them a love of God and of their fellows that they may, in very deed, remember the teachings of the Savior. May the people of Christ love God with all their might, mind, and strength, and may they love their brother as themselves. May the peace of heaven attend the Latter-day Saints. May the Lord bless their flocks, their herds, all their possessions, and all that pertaineth unto them. May they grow in a love of the gospel, in a love of truth, in a love of their fellows; and I, as the mouthpiece of the Lord here upon the earth, bless all the Latter-day Saints and the honest the world over, and pray God to confound the wicked and to bring their schemes to naught, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

No more diligent, faithful, inspiring mission president have I ever been associated with than Elder Serge F. Ballif, while presiding over the Swiss and German mission. He has been called to go back again to that country. The gospel found his father there and he gave up a place as a preacher, I understand, to come here and labor for his livelihood in this land as a Latter-day Saint. We will now hear from the new president of the Swiss and German mission, Elder Serge F. Ballif.

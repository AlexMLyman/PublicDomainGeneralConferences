The Deseret News has been broadcasting all the remarks made here this morning and this afternoon. 

I desire to express my gratitude and thanks to all the Saints for the very remarkable and splendid order we have had during all our conference meetings. I believe it has been the very best of any conference I have ever attended. 

I am very grateful for the very large attendance. I am thankful for the inspiration of the Lord to all those who have spoken. 

I am grateful indeed that President Penrose, who will soon be 92 years of age, has been able to be with us and lift up his voice in testimony of the divinity of this great work. 

We will now ask you to arise and President Penrose will offer the benediction.

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, that I rejoice in having the opportunity of attending this conference, and listening to the inspiring words of our beloved President Heber J. Grant. Surely the testimony, the spirit and power of the message of the Prophet of God must have found the innermost parts of our souls. The Lord is with this people, and with his servants whom he has given charge concerning this great Latter-day work. 

Surely the people of the world must discover that we love them when we send thousands of our boys and girls to the ends of the earth to cry repentance unto mankind, and to deliver the message that the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to this people. My brethren and sisters, I thank God that I was born of goodly parents, who hearkened unto the voice of the elders in a foreign land, and that they gathered with this people. I thank the Lord for my standing in the Church, and for my association with the General Authorities, and the brethren and sisters of this Church. 

We have a splendid people in the state of Idaho. They are serving the Lord, determined to keep his commandments, and establish the truth, that men everywhere may know that our Father has set his hand to accomplish his work and to save his children, to bring about peace in the earth and good will to men. May the Lord bless us and help us to accomplish every desire of our hearts, and to this end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

There are five members of the First Council of Seventy that have not had the opportunity of speaking to us, and I had the names of some of our honored returned missionaries who have presided in some of the foreign missions, on my list. Time will not permit of our brethren speaking to us, as I am sure they would like to do, but we are going to stay here — those of us who are not so hungry that we are anxious to get away — until we hear from these brethren of the First Council of Seventy.

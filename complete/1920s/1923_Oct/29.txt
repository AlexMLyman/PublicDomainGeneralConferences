The choir sang, "An angel from on high," solos by Sister Sarah Wood and Hyrum Christensen. This hymn was sung on the Hill Cumorah recently on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the visits of the Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith. On the present occasion only three of the verses were sung. President Heber J. Grant read the remainder of the words as follows: 

The time is now fulfilled, 

The long expected day; 

Let earth obedient yield, 

And darkness flee away; 

Remove the seals, be wide unfurled 

Its light and glory to the world. 

Lo, Israel filled with joy, 

Shall now be gathered home, 

Their wealth and power employ 

To build Jerusalem; 

While Zion shall arise and shine; 

And fill the earth with truth divine. 

Words by Parley P. Pratt.

I regret to say that Brother Whitney's health is of such character that he has not been able to be with us during our conference, so far, and he feels that he cannot come this morning nor this afternoon. I am pleased to inform you, however, that his health has very greatly improved, during the past six months, and that he is again able occasionally, in fact nearly always, to meet with us once a week in the temple in the regular council meeting of the Presidency, the Apostles and the Patriarch. But considering the state of his nerves at the present time, he does not feel that it is wisdom to be here and mingle with a large crowd. He is with us in spirit and we hope and pray that he may be here in vigor of body and mind six months from today.

Hill Cumorah

PART OF THE HILL CUMORAH PURCHASED 

I forgot one item that we have here, namely that we are now the owners of a part of the Hill Cumorah. The Church, a few weeks ago, purchased a farm of ninety odd acres, which embraces the West slope of the Hill Cumorah, about one-third of the way up the hill. There is a nice farm house, and it is a very fine piece of property. Elder Willard Bean, in charge of the Memorial Home, or the Smith Farm, wrote us that he could purchase this property, and we are glad now that at least part of the hill is in the posession of the Church.

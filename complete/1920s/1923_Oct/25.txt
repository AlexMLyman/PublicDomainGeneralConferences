I wish to say that I have been very gratified indeed with our meetings here today. I feel that the Lord has abundantly blessed us in our gatherings and that we have had a rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit. 

I regret exceedingly that we have to limit our brethren to a very few minutes when they speak here. There is hardly one of the brethren who has stood upon his feet but what, I am sure, could edify this congregation for an hour or more if the opportunity were presented; but if you stop to think of the fact that there are twenty-six of the general authorities, and that we are anxious to hear from the mission presidents and from as many stake presidents as we possibly can, you will realize that we can only barely have testimonies borne by most of the brethren in these conference meetings.

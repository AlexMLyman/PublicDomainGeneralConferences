My brethren and sisters, I have enjoyed the opportunity of meeting with you in this Conference and in seeing the spirit that is manifest on the part of the Saints from all parts of the country where they are located, in striving to be represented here upon this occasion. Gatherings such as we have twice a year, bringing us from all parts of the land, enable us to renew our old acquaintanceship, and form new friendships, look into each other's faces, and drink in of the spirit that pervades each district of country from which we come. If we utilize properly the talents that our Father in heaven has given us, all on their return to their homes and neighborhoods will carry with them a spirit of improvement, and a determination, so far as practicable, to awaken in their district the determination to more fully meet the obligations and requirements of the faith that we have espoused.  
  
We can only judge fairly by comparison; and by these associations that are offered us the opportunity for that comparison is opened up unto us — gathering new thoughts and ideas, and comparing conditions as they exist with ourselves, and as they exist, and are seen and felt in the companionship and spirit of other sections of our country. We can go forth renewed in spirit, aroused in our determination to see that the sections from which we come are fully up to the standard, as presented in other sections of the country, and in the expression of sentiment given to us as we shall meet former acquaintances, and of the hopes and fears that we ourselves entertain, and that are manifest in the expressions of others whom we love and with whom we probably mingled in former days.  
  
The Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are informed by the sacred scriptures, is "the power of God unto salvation." There are none of us that can question this statement made in former times, who have received the impress of that spirit upon which some of the brethren have spoken during the former sessions of this conference. It, without doubt, meant fully the adoption of rules, the acceptance of principles, the establishment of a standard, that should guide and govern our lives, or the lives of former day Saints while they were sojourning upon the earth, and that preparation necessary to prepare us for the conditions that exist beyond the veil. Therefore, when we consider the basis of the faith that we have espoused, and that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is indeed the power of God unto salvation, each one of us can look into our own souls; we know the temptations and trials and besetments of our own lives; we have a full understanding of our own weaknesses! and under that faith which the Lord has given us in the acceptance of His holy Gospel, we start in to so fully and thoroughly educate ourselves in the understanding of the same, that whenever we comply with each condition, fulfill each and every obligation, there is registered in our own souls, by the spirit of our Father the word of approval; and whenever, perchance, in the performance of our part, and the discharge of the various duties and obligations that rest upon us, we fall below the fulfillment of the sacred duties that we have promised to obey, there is within us the feeling of dissatisfaction, of uncertainty, and of doubt.  
  
Therefore, my brothers and sisters, those that have received of the impress of the heavenly gift, who have been partakers of that Gospel which is to be the power of God unto salvation to every one that shall obey and fulfill its requirements, the opportunities presented in our gathering- together upon these occasions, in marking the way of our advancement by comparison with others, actuated by like hope, established in like determination, and pressing forward to the accomplishment of the same purposes,renew within us that determination, and increase the spirit and feeling to do and be indeed the children of the Father who sent us here. There is but little doubt that there are many people who, standing in our organization as members of the Church of Christ, are not fully converted to our principles; there are quite a number, as all of us know who are conversant with the actual conditions that exist among the people everywhere, who are in that frame of mind that they have accepted of the faith, because their parents accepted it. There are some who have been impressed with the idea that the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints conform to the doctrines of the Scripture, and conforming to them, they acepted of them upon this basis, without the particular effort, or necessary effort to secure for themselves the witness of the spirit of that Gospel. They rejoice in the evidences that are manifest upon some occasions in discussions or debates wherein the Scriptures are utilized as an argument in connection with our fellow men to the destruction and overthrow of views that they may have entertained; but there are those who receive from the divine source the witness of that spirit which brings conviction to every fibre of the human being; that writes upon the heart; that fixes itself upon the brain; that establishes itself in such a form that no matter what the circumstances or conditions are in life it is written there not to be effaced; and no matter where the individuals might be, or what the circumstances were, their witness for the truth would be given in humility relying upon the mercies and goodness of their Heavenly Father.  
  
We are acquitting ourselves as a people very nobly in the efforts that we are making in scattering the seeds of the Gospel among the nations of the earth. Our brothers, our fathers, our sons, are performing their duties in this respect with heroic courage and fortitude; but when we look into the internal concerns of our country and state and see the needs and necessities of hosts of our young men especially (when I use the word hosts, I use it in the sense that there are many) who are moral, upright, earnest, and devoted, so far as that is concerned to the regular duties and responsibilities of life, but whose minds have net been touched with the sacred fire, whose hearts have gone out in the various directions in the accomplishment of their walks in life, so far as the temporal duties of life are concerned, and who have been led to think perchance father and mother, carried away in their enthusiasm for the faith that they have espoused, are not altogether in that condition or frame of mind that would impress them with that which seems so dear to father and mother, we realize that every effort made in the direction of the improvement and establishment in their minds of a proper understanding of the Gospel is a duty we owe to them. I realize that in our anxiety sometimes as parents in these matters, the constant following of our sons, the constant effort to impress them with the same religious fire that has been aroused in our breasts, may in some instances be overdone, as remarked to me upon one occasion by an eminent man in our nation who classes himself as an infidel. "I became infidel," he remarked, "to the faith of my fathers for the reason of the strict anxiety upon the part gf father and mother to impress me with their faith." While this should not be an excuse on the part of men for disregarding the wishes of moral fathers and mothers, who sought to impress upon the minds of their children the sacred obligation they owed to their Father in heaven, there may be in some few instances cause for complaint on the part of thoughtless boys and thoughtless girls in connection with this matter. It seems to me that the proper application of our home government, the seeking to secure the aid and assistance of the boys and the girls in the discharge of the duties of that home, in their taking part in family prayer, in their assisting in the saying of grace at the table, in their being kindly and gently pled with, in striving to awaken in their minds that sacred reverence or love for the Supreme Being, would bridge most of the chasms that are found in the way of the development of legitimate and proper faith in the minds of some of the thoughtless ones.  
  
I am a believer in the thought that the sons and daughters of the Latter-day Saints are not recreant to their faith, or to the faith of their fathers. I recognize the fact in my own experience, as I note the conditions that arise in many lives, that while there is a thoughtless period that attends every boy and every girl, when they pass a certain stage in their history, their hearts turn to their home and to the influences of that home, and to the efforts that were made to impress them in that home with a sacred regard for the name of their Heavenly Father, and for the sacred laws that He has given. And inasmuch as we fulfill the requirements placed upon us to teach our sons and daughters the principles of that Gospel, that power of God unto salvation; have sought to establish within them honesty; have sought to fix upon their minds that justice and mercy and propriety and wisdom should govern them as the seeds are sown; as their minds are guarded; as their hearts are cultivated; as they are uplifted in their being by the uprightness and consistency and prudence of the examples of their fathers and mothers, one by one they will find themselves taking their place in the ranks of that religion that God has called to aid in carrying forth the truths of the Gospel which He has given to us in our day.  
  
I desire, my brethren and sisters that you will consider these matters; that there shall be adopted in the regulations of every home that wisdom and prudence that should characterize the Bishop of a ward, the Teachers of blocks, the High Priests, Seventies and Elders, and all that class of men who have been made partakers of the heavenly gift, that the spirit of truth, striking our own souls and vibrating therein, shall make its way among the children of men; that all who may enter our home circle or our neighborhood circle, shall feel and see that our hearts are in attune to the principles of right, mercy, and justice and the principles of propriety in everything that tends to turn and make man and woman more noble and true.  
  
In connection with my brethren, I desire to bear my testimony to the truth Of the Gospel, and the sacredness of that mission given of God in the introduction of this work, and to the uprightness and honesty and determination that exist on the part of those you have sustained as guides in connection with this work, and to the spirit of love engendered in their breasts for the work of God and the extension of the principles of the Gospel on the lines of justice and right so far as it is possible for man with his weaknesses to walk in harmony with the wishes of our Father in heaven. I bear you my witness that this is indeed the Gospel of Christ; that it will be indeed a power of God unto salvation to every man and every woman that shall adopt its rules and walk in the way marked out by the revealed will of our Father in the day and age in which we live. That God may bless you all, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

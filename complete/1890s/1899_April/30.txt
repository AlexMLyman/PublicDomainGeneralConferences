In answer to the question of Brother Bickley, from Beaver, whether children should be allowed to partake of the Sacrament after they are eight years of age and are not baptized: Of course, the law should be observed, and, in order that this question need not be asked in regard to the children of the Latter-day Saints, we would advise that the Bishops, who have the baptisms under their care, see to it that arrangements are made in every ward that the children may be baptized when they are eight years of age. We have been lenient in this regard— that is, the rule of the Church has been— and the children have been allowed to partake of the Sacrament after they were eight years of age in order that they might not feel injured and their hearts hurt. But, the Bishops should make the arrangements in their respective wards that on any day in the year, cold or warm, the children may be baptized when eight years of age. It is a splendid thing to do; it is a nice arrangement and ought to be observed in all the Church. But until this is done — when children are anxious and want to be baptized and it is not their fault that they have not been — we ought not to be too stringent in refusing the Sacrament to the children of the Latter-day Saints. They would like to be baptized and they ought to be. If they are not baptized at the proper time, the sin be upon the head of the Bishop.

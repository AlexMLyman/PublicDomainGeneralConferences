I am very much pleased to meet with the brethren and sisters and our friends this morning. We have another beautiful day, like yesterday, and I hope that the Latter-day Saints feel happy. We had an excellent meeting yesterday. The spirit of the Lord was with us greatly; the most excellent ideas and suggestions were made to us by the different speakers; the beauties and glories of what the Lord has accomplished already, and those we anticipate and are sure He will accomplish in the future, were clearly portrayed before us.  
  
If we will be as quiet as we were yesterday and exercise faith we will have just as good a meeting today and the Spirit of the Lord will inspire the speakers.  
  
We have invited the Salt Lake Temple choir to be with us during the remaining part of our conference and it will be called upon occasionally to interest the Latter-day Saints. We think they will be pleased with this opportunity of hearing this choir, which has been employed in the Temple here for about six years.  
  
Brethren and sisters, God bless you and pour out His spirit upon us this day, that we may greatly rejoice, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

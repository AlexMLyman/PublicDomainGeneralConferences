I am sorry to tell you that Brother George Albert Smith is suffering from quite a severe attack of lumbago, which is the reason that he has not been at this Conference. He sends his greetings. I had a little visit with him this morning, he is improving, but I did not feel that it would be wise for him to come to the meeting this afternoon. 

We of course regret the absence of Brother Joseph Fielding Smith. He is in Europe and has done a fine work there. We are grateful that he was in Europe when the war broke out. 

Elder Levi Edgar Young of the General Authorities is absent from us presiding over the New England Mission. 

Elder John H. Taylor was assigned to be in New York to assist Brother Frank Evans in taking care of our missionaries who are returning from Europe and to assign to their new fields of labor those who have not completed their missions. We regret his absence. 

Yesterday I forgot to express our deep appreciation for the beautiful singing of the chorus of the Branch Agricultural College at Cedar City. We thoroughly appreciated their singing and are grateful to them for making such a long trip to come here and help make this Conference of interest. 

We are always grateful to our Singing Mothers for the fine contribution which they give to us.

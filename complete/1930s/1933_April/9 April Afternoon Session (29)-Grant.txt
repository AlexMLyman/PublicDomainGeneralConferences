Since our last Conference one of the most beloved, most energetic and most estimable members of the General Authorities of the Church has passed away, a man whose voice has been heard here many many times and one who has filled several missions in Great Britain. Until shortly before his decease he had been presiding over the California Mission of the Church. During his administration several hundred thousands of dollars were expended in the erection of chapels in that mission, and three stakes were organized in what was the California Mission at the time that Brother Joseph W. McMurrin was made its president. He was one of the great preachers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these last days, a man with a perfect and abiding testimony of the divinity of the work in which we as Latter-day Saints are engaged; a man who won the love and respect not only of members of the Church but of all with whom he came in contact, for his sincerity, his honesty and his fearless defense of the work of the Lord.

I consider it one of the greatest compliments that could possibly be paid to our organ and choir recitals that the Columbia Broadcasting System — nation-wide — should request us to lengthen our Sunday programs from a half hour to an hour. It is said that the testing of a thing is what counts. The doubling of the program is a splendid testimony of its value, and we all feel grateful to the choir and organists. It is no small task for them to prepare and rehearse their numbers and then come here and spend a full hour every Sunday morning playing and singing to the people of the world. 

I endorse all the good things that have been said about the leader of the choir, our organists and the members of the choir themselves. 

All those who wish to hear the choir and organ broadcast Sunday morning should be quietly seated in this building by half past nine.

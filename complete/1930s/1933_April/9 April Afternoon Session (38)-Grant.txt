 I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints at the close of this Conference that I am very happy, as I said at the beginning, to be here, and I have enjoyed it from start to finish, as I am sure all of you have. 

I am grateful to the Lord for the words of congratulation that have come to me from every person that has spoken to me regarding the choice of Brother J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and Brother Samuel O. Bennion. They have my unbounded love and confidence, and have earned the distinction that has come to them. 

May God bless us one and all. May his blessings attend every person holding a place of responsibility. May he bless our Choir members, and all who have taken part in preaching, praying, and singing the songs of Zion, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I feel that we owe a very deep debt of gratitude to Evan Stephens, George Careless, Joseph J. Daynes, Ebenezer Beesley and others who have written beautiful music for us. I am free to confess that when I go out into the country districts and hear sung certain anthems, I wonder why the people do not show preference for the home-made article. I think that Evan Stephens and these other men were inspired of the Lord to write music for us. I do not want to reflect on any of the magnificent things that have been written by others, but I have gone to many a conference where I have listened to anthems when I would rather have heard a good Latter-day Saint hymn sung.

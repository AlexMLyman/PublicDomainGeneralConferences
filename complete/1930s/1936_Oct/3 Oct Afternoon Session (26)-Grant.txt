As you all are aware, Brother Joseph F. Merrill and Brother Richard R. Lyman are absent from this Conference, also Brother Alonzo A. Hinckley. Brother Lyman is presiding over the European Mission, having succeeded Brother Merrill who is on his way home. Elder Hinckley has returned from California and is at the home of one of his daughters in this city. He is greatly improved in health and is gaining in flesh. He is on the high road to recovery.

Oh, how I wish every father and mother, every lover of children in this great country of ours, could be here with us this morning, to sit, as I have been sitting, and receive the inspiration given you in your great Church, from your leaders; to hear this wonderful music swelling out from this great Tabernacle! I am sure they would all realize, as I realize, that our children are in good hands, and that the citizens of tomorrow will be finer citizens even than the citizens of today. 

I speak to you as a messenger from Washington, representing the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. How fortunate it is that this conference, called by the Governor of Utah, will be held in this city immediately following this great conference of your Church. Certainly there has never been a time more opportune to hope for the children of the future everything which is guaranteed to them by the Children's Charter, adopted at the close of the White House Conference in Washington last November. 

May I read to you the first paragraph of that great Charter, because I know every member of your Church, and every citizen of the country, wishes for every child spiritual and moral training to help him to stand firm under the pressure of life: 

"For every child understanding, and the guarding of his personality as his most precious right; and for every child a home, and that love and security which a home provides." 

May I, speaking for the twelve hundred members of the White House Conference, who have labored for a long time to bring together facts on which we can build a finer world for our children, bring you my grateful thanks for the opportunity you have given me to stand before you this morning.

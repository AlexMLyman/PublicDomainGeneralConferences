I rejoice in the work in which we are engaged. For some reason I am impelled to say — though it is manifestly unnecessary, as President Grant needs no defense from me, but I think it is proper — that I am not only in hearty accord with his declarations relative to the enforcement of, and obedience to law; but that I have known him for nearly half a century, lived in the same Ward, associated with him in business, socially, religiously and even politically, and there has been nothing more characteristic of him than his frankness and above-board expressions. Any man who knows him will not say to the contrary. May God bless him, and may he live long to continue the splendid work which he is doing, and those also who are upholding his hands. 

The Eastern States Mission is in a very healthy condition, especially the missionaries. Our winter was as open and mild as it was severe here. Branches of the Church are in a very healthy condition. I know of no better evidence of that fact, than that last year there was paid something over thirty per cent more tithing than was ever paid before in the mission, and the amount paid the preceding year was largely in excess of that of any former year. If there is anything that tests honesty and sincerity, it is the payment of tithing. Well may the old prophets have said: "Will ye rob God in tithes and offerings?" We can account for the maintenance of the payment of tithing to some extent, if not largely, because our people are generally employed by large institutions with many employes; and although hundreds of thousands, even millions, have been thrown out of employment, the honest tithepayers, I testify, as a very general rule, have not. Their sincerity, their honesty, have been so reflected, I am sure, in the stability and value of their characters that their employers have recognized the same. 

The Mission has been exceptionally blessed during the past year. Indeed, I think a marvelous work has been done through the providence of God, which was commenced in this building, by broadcasting sermons and organ recitals. The hearts of the people of the East have softened marvelously in the last two years. The press has materially changed its attitude. A different atmosphere very largely prevails. We were deeply impressed with the importance of utilizing modern agencies in the dissemination of the truth. 

We organized three new departments of our activities. The first and most important, broadcasting of sermons over the radio; second, exhibiting Mormonism in a practical way in exhibitions and fairs. The largest of these exhibits was at the Eastern States Exhibition where all of the states in our mission meet annually. They have permanent buildings at Springfield, Massachusetts. Our exhibition was in a booth in the main building over which was displayed in large letters the name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in still larger letters, "See what God hath wrought." In the rear of our exhibit we had a small replica of the Salt Lake Temple. The booth was appropriately decorated. Streamers were used leading to the Temple, on which pertinent data were displayed concerning the Word of Wisdom, our system of educating the young, and our unequalled charity system. On a table at the entrance was an ample supply of tracts. There we distributed in eight days over 25,000 tracts. A half dozen missionaries distributed thousands of tracts daily, making friends, having conversations, and reaching people who would not permit them to come into their homes. They could not get past the butler, or the servant, ordinarily. 

Then we went to the country fairs. The young artist, for such Elder Carl E. Olson (whom we made Director of Exhibitions) proved himself to be, skilfully designed, out on the green, an old oaken bucket well, over which he had written in large letters, "The well of living water," with the name of the Church above it. It attracted a great deal of attention and thousands of tracts were again distributed. 

Time will not permit more on that line. I should like to tell you more about other things. We are desperately in need of missionaries and especially singers. If we are not supplied with some singers soon to take the places of those who are leaving, we shall have to give up some of the stations over which we are broadcasting the Gospel every Sabbath day. The prediction of Isaiah is fulfilled, wherein it says that "A little child shall lead them," and that the Lord would take "the weak things of the world to confound the mighty," and accomplish his marvelous works. Also the prediction in the Book of Mormon that the Gospel will be preached from the housetops is being literally fulfilled. 

The first missionary who broadcast for us over the radio was Elder Carrol D. Parkinson of Preston, Idaho, a nineteen year old missionary We had to pay for the privilege so gave it up temporarily. That was on the 11th of April last, and immediately following the great Centennial celebration in this city. We sent President Grant over a thousand clippings from newspapers; some of the largest, like the New York Times, had lengthy articles. 

This great organ has been making us friends. The intelligent realize that such music can come only from a people of intelligence and elevated ideals, and not from ignorance and bigotry. And thus interest has been aroused in our people. It is certainly marvelous that where we found an opening we had without previous thought the best talent available. 

The first real opening was at Wilkesbarre, Pa., a city of nearly one hundred thousand population, where two of our young elders were laboring — Elder D. Glen Brown of Provo, twenty years of age, who has been with us only seven months, and his companion John M. Anderson of Logan. They did the real pioneering, persisting in their efforts to obtain the privilege of speaking over the radio without cost. Finally the station, the oldest in the city, and the largest, was in need of something to fill in with, and the privilege was given to these young men. Notwithstanding the short notice, they met the occasion splendidly. A quartet of our missionaries sang some of our hymns which with the address was so pleasing, that they were invited to continue, and every Sabbath evening since the 18th day of May last, we have had a half hour, during which we sing the hymns of Zion and preach a sermon. 

On September 10th, Elder Brown, with only two years education at the Brigham Young University, was made editor and director of radio work for the mission. 

The next opening was at Wilmington, the largest city in Delaware. Sister Mary Woozley, from Malad, had won the friendship of the members of a Scottish society, partly by her piano playing; and ever since the 31st of August we have likewise broadcast there, Elder George F. Williams, of Ogden, another nineteen year old missionary, being the principal address writer and speaker. That station is the largest in the State of Delaware. It has a population of over two million within a radius of one hundred miles. 

They say that there are more than thirty million people in our mission. It is the great center of wealth and of the leading educational institutions of the nation. It is singularly appropriate that in the very section where the Gospel was introduced, the most modern and effective methods should be utilized in proclaiming the Gospel. We have only about three missionaries to a million of people to preach the Gospel in this mission, but they can and are doing a marvelous work over the radio. 

The next opportunity came in a still larger city, Syracuse, which has a population of more than two hundred thousand. There, another young man, Elder Earl H. Martin, was located, the only solo singer in the Mission. He won the hearts of the radio listeners by singing for several months without doing any preaching. Finally, we decided to use him elsewhere unless they permitted us to also preach. Then they gave us an hour on Sunday evening and called it a vesper service. Sometimes we deliver two sermons during the evening, with music intervening. This so aroused the other churches that they demanded the same privilege, and now we have to take turns with them. 

There is no place in the Mission, where an opportunity has been given us to preach over the radio, that the privilege has been taken from us. If you will give us the missionaries, especially those who can sing, we can accomplish a great work. We have thus, in ten months, delivered 212 Gospel messages over the radio in the Mission in important and prominent cities of the East, without cost to the Church; and the work has been splendidly done by youths generally under twenty-two years. To me it is nothing short of marvelous. For some time, as we contemplated and discussed this matter, I thought that unless we could have Dr. Talmage, President Roberts or some such speaker and writer, it would be useless for us to try. They could not come to our aid. The desirability of attempting this work was pressed upon us so strongly that we concluded to utilize the material that we had at hand. If the Lord ever blessed missionaries he has those in the Eastern States Mission who have participated in this work, for they were all young and inexperienced. Some of our indifferent missionaries who could sing or write have been aroused to greater activity. Forty-one of our missionaries, some of them quite uneducated, have written addresses. Twenty-eight of them have spoken over the radio. Young ladies have written splendid addresses. Two of them have spoken over the radio. I say it is marvelous. But more marvelous and important — and more do I value it above all else — is the knowledge that I have of the divinity of this work, that God lives, that his servants, when in the performance of their duty under the call of the priesthood of God, have the inspiration of the Lord with them. He is with us, and there is a joy, a happiness and a consolation in the performance of duty, in the service of the Lord, that is inexplicable. 

May we appreciate our opportunities and blessings, and may you send us missionaries who can sing, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

The national broadcast of the tabernacle choir begins at 4:15 this afternoon. It is important, therefore, that this meeting close promptly ' at four o'clock, in order to permit those who desire to leave the building to do so before that time, so that the doors can be closed and absolute quiet prevail during the broadcast. 

The national broadcasts of the tabernacle choir number to date approximately ninety. These have covered practically this entire nation as well as Canada. They have been transmitted to some extent at least, by short waves, to Europe. Many thousands of letters have been received expressing appreciation for these broadcasts. Some such letters have come from England.

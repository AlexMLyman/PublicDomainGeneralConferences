We have received the following greeting from President Castle Murphy of the Hawaiian Mission: 

"Aloha to the leading brethren and sisters and the Church in general, from the missionaries and the good people of the Hawaiian Mission. May you have a wonderful outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord in every session of the One Hundred and First Annual Conference of the Church, is the fervent prayer of each of us who labors in this choice land of love, music and flowers â€” Hawaii."

I wish to read for the benefit of our distinguished guest, Dr. Barnard, the following: 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ, the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. 

"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized. 

"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And. they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord. 

"Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them." 

We very much appreciate having our eminent visitor here, and would have been happy had he seen fit to make further remarks.

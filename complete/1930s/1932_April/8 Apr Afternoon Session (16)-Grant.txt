The auditor's report was not included in the statistics given by me this morning. It is as follows: 

Salt Lake City, Utah, April 4th, 1932. President Heber J. Grant and Counselors, Dear Brethren: â€” 

It gives us pleasure to state that our examination of the reports of the First Presidency's office, which cover the Presiding Bishop's department, discloses the fact that the Church is entirely out of debt. The accounting system of the Church is modern and complete. 

Respectfully submitted, Henry H. Rolapp, O. W. Adams, John W. Hart, 

Auditing Committee.

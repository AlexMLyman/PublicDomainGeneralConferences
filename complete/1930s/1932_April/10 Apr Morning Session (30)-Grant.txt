Mr. H. A. Smith of Arizona, who has been addressing the Commercial Club, is here in the interest of a tariff on copper. We wish him God-speed in getting it. I do not think I could get one vote against a tariff on copper. 

I wish to say, incidentally, do not go wild over a lot of books that claim the world is coming to an end in a few days. The scriptures tell us that no one knoweth. I am sure that some of the people who are wasting days, weeks and months of study trying to frighten themselves to death will not be successful.

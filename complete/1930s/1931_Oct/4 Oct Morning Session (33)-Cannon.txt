I am happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to associate with you at this time in this splendid conference and to partake of the spirit of this gathering. But I tremble in the occupancy of this position. 

We have met together in this conference to consider matters pertaining to the welfare and progress not only of the Latter-day Saints, but of all mankind. The principles of this Gospel which we accept, and the practices which we endeavor to carry forward are, we consider, not only beneficial to us but to all the people of the earth. We realize that this Gospel has come to us as a free gift. That is, we have not organized it, but the Lord has established it, and we have been offered the opportunity to accept it and enjoy the benefits which come from obedience to it. I am sure that all that has been said in this conference is profitable to all men everywhere. 

LEADERSHIP OF MOSES 

I am reminded of the time when Moses had endeavored to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt into the promised land. After they had rejected his counsels and instruction, and the Lord had declared that they, as a people, should not enter into the promised land, they were kept in the wilderness until that generation had passed away, with one or two exceptions, and a new generation had grown up. But under the leadership of Joshua they were permitted to go into the land of Canaan. After they had been in the land of Canaan and had subdued that country and had become established therein, many of them neglected the observance of the commandments of the Lord and fell away and were led into strange ways and to the worship of strange gods. 

CHOOSE WHOM YOU WILL SERVE 

We are told that shortly before his death Joshua called the people together and presented these matters to them. I should like to read to you briefly what he said: 

"Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. 

"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." 

FAITH IN GOD NEEDED 

It seems to me that if there ever was a time in the history of the world when faith in the living God was necessary it is the present time — faith which will produce works of righteousness; faith which will enable men to live in accordance with the will of God and be able to walk in his paths; faith which will cause them to desire to consecrate themselves to the advancement of the purposes of the Lord. This will enable them also to cultivate the spirit of repentance, to realize from time to time, their shortcomings, their mistakes, and the things which they are doing contrary to the will of God, and to endeavor to overcome those things and thereby to develop in power, righteousness and truth. 

PURPOSE OF GOSPEL 

The Latter-day Saints believe that the Gospel comprehends the worship of the living God — the Father and the Son — as has been testified to by Brother Richards who has just spoken. We believe that this Gospel is intended for the welfare of all mankind. It will enable all who accept and live it to learn how to live together in unity in this life, and to prepare for eternity. It comprehends within itself those things which will help to promote not only the spiritual welfare of mankind, which is the most vital thing, but also their temporal progress. 

CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS 

If this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, what does it do for us? It helps us first to improve ourselves, to put our own lives in harmony with the principles which the Savior declared at the time when he was upon the earth, and which have been revealed anew in these days; to live lives of fairness, of justice, of mercy, of sympathy and of righteousness. It enables us also to cultivate greater consideration for our fellow men and desire for their progress and welfare. Likewise, it helps men to cultivate that spirit of repentance which is necessary in order to be able to overcome past mistakes, and to resist highmindedness, pride and selfishness. 

PRIESTHOOD FOR GUIDANCE 

So also is it important that all who have accepted this Gospel should be able to keep ourselves free from the worship of strange gods, that will interfere with our progress, whether it be that of wealth, the desire for excessive luxury, incorrect principles, or what not. The Church has within itself the power to aid greatly in the solution of temporal as well as spiritual problems that trouble mankind, because it has that inspired leadership which leads to truth — the basis of all real progress. In this connection you will realize that when Joshua spoke to the people of Israel he spoke as one who had been ordained to lead the people by the authority of the priesthood, which Moses had conferred upon him. So, in these days, we have those who are called to lead this people by the authority of the holy priesthood and hold the keys of the authority thereof. They labor in all humility and faith, and with a desire to serve the people as their servants, as was expressed to us last night by President Nibley. 

DEMAND FOR A MODERN MOSES 

Recently, in a number of magazines and newspapers, articles have appeared calling for a modern Moses to lead the people out of the temporal depression which prevails throughout the world. When such a desire is expressed the question naturally arises whether the counsels of such a leader would be given any more attention than were those of that prophet by the people among whom he lived. Mankind is always much the same, except as it may be imbued with faith and the Spirit of God. You will remember that Moses himself could not lead the people over whom he presided out of the wilderness, because they refused to accept his counsel, even though he spoke to them in the name of the Lord. They rejected him and, because of the rejection of the Lord through his servant, they failed to enter the promised land. But, in the thousands of years that have elapsed since the death of Moses, people have come to honor him as a prophet. As the Savior said, they honor the dead, but they stone the living prophets. It is probably natural for people to fail to accept the counsel of those who are in their midst — wise men, great men — who may be inspired to declare what is helpful and good for them. 

INSPIRED LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH 

The Latter-day Saints have been blessed in the leadership of men who have had wisdom and judgment. We believe not only in the teaching of spiritual things, but also of things that affect the temporal welfare of the Latter-day Saints and of mankind at large. The Lord has inspired his servants who lead this people, to declare the things that are good for them in the midst of this prevailing depression. I would like to recite to you some of the things that have been said by the leaders of this Church today, yesterday, the day before, and for a long time past, which affect the welfare not only of this people but of all mankind for good; and would have helped them to relieve themselves of much of the trouble that prevails today, if they had accepted and lived in accordance with these things. When I say these things I speak to myself as well as to you. 

Here are some of the things which I desire to call briefly to your attention because I think they are important. They are counsels that have been given us that would save us from trouble, distress and tribulation: 

Live within your Income: It is the only way to progress, peace and prosperity. President Brigham Young declared: 

"Learn to do without that which you cannot purchase and pay for; and bring your minds into subjection that you must and will live within your means." 

Cultivate Thrift: It is just as important for us to realize that we should save out of that which we earn for times of trouble and distress as it was for Egypt in the time of Joseph to save during the seven years of prosperity and of growing crops, for the seven years of famine and distress that would come after them, it has been said that capital represents the savings of civilization. We should put aside our savings in the form of cash and place those savings where they will be taken care of and where they will be secure. That requires wisdom and judgment. 

Get out of Debt: We were told that last evening by President Ivins, and we have been counseled to this effect repeatedly in the past. How many of us have accepted that advice? All of us would be far better off if we had accepted it and observed it. 

Avoid Speculation: One of the important causes of the present depression and of every other panic is excessive speculation during prosperous times. In 1929 the fever of speculation spread everywhere. It has been said that periods of prosperity and of hard times will recur as long as the agencies of production and exchange are strained to the limit to meet demands stimulated to extravagance by a universal passion of speculation. 

Pay as You Go: We have been counseled again and again not to mortgage our futures. We should not be misled by those high pressure salesmen who will sell us continually on the promise of our being able to pay during our lifetime. Shall we profit by such counsel in the future? 

Patronise Home Industry: We heard the counsel from President Grant last evening to support local industries, and we have heard it repeatedly from many other leaders of the Church. As stated by him, thousands, in fact I have been told by the Manufacturers' Association that in this State alone twenty thousand men and women, could be employed in addition to those already employed, if the people of this State were to buy the products that are manufactured here. In these intermountain states particularly greater encouragement and patronage of home manufactures on the part of people who live here are necessary for our mutual welfare, because we are not so favorably situated as the coast cities and others advantageously located for transportation rates and markets. But we have the raw materials, and it seems to me there should be nothing go out of this intermountain country as far as it is possible to avoid that is not in manufactured form. There should be no good reason why the price and quality of all our products should not favorably compete with others. 

Watch your Markets — Avoid Over-production: The people have been advised by Church leaders to study market conditions and to avoid excessive production, whether in farm products or in prepared commodities. Agriculturists have been urged to diversify, and to produce for their own requirements as far as possible. President Brigham Young told the people: "Learn to sustain yourselves. Produce everything you need to eat, drink or wear." Industries have been encouraged to cater particularly to nearby markets. One of the most powerful causes of the trouble that exists today is because of the difference between production and consumption. It has been declared that prosperity is a state of equilibrium between production and consumption. 

Overcome Selfishness — Avoid Greed: This counsel applies less to the Latter-day Saints probably than to any other group. But the prevalence of selfishness and greed among mankind has contributed greatly to the present situation. The free operation of economic laws is interfered with by selfish human interests. It has been said that the fundamental cause of unrighteousness is the desire for power and for wealth, coupled with the character and purpose of that desire. 

OVERCOME PAST MISTAKES 

My brethren and sisters, if we as a people had in past years observed these instructions, referred to here very briefly, we should hardly have noticed the depression. It would scarcely affect us, certainly not nearly to the extent that it has done up to the present time. If we will learn from our mistakes and repent of our shortsightedness and our failure to observe the counsel and advice of these men who stand here to lead and guide us, we shall profit in the future. And if the people of this nation and the world would generally observe these instructions which have been given from time to time by the inspired leaders of the Church, all would be far better off and there would not be suffering nearly to the same extent as that which has occurred. Neglect to follow such rules has contributed very largely to produce the present unfavorable conditions. 

CRITICAL ATTITUDE CAUSED BY ADVERSITY 

A critical attitude is prevalent at present throughout the earth with relation to existing conditions. Such an attitude is probably to be expected because of the adverse circumstances and the suffering that many people are going through for lack even of the necessities of life. They are almost desperate. It is, of course, very important that everything possible should be done through cooperation, by donations and every other available means to prevent suffering and assure at least the necessities of life for people everywhere. It is vital, also, that everyone, as far as possible, shall be given opportunity to work. 

PANACEAS SUGGESTED 

Many panaceas have been suggested to avoid the recurrence of such conditions as prevail at present. Some are constructive; others are destructive. Some proposals are altruistic in nature; others are utterly selfish. There are those who would forcibly and unlawfully take the property of others in violation of the rights guaranteed to all citizens under the Constitution. Naturally, the representatives of the people in Congress can, with the approval of the President, proceed to change the laws wherever necessary to protect the citizens as a whole from improper aggrandizement of property by a few, and to promote the general welfare. You cannot legislate righteousness into people, but you can and should bring about, through the law-enforcing agencies general respect for and observance of law. 

ALL THINGS IN COMMON 

There are others who advocate the principle of having all things in common. That is a very fine doctrine. Any group that can subscribe to it wholeheartedly, labor unitedly, wisely and diligently for the welfare of the whole, and maintain loyalty, altruism and kindliness constantly, can doubtless succeed in developing a splendid community. But it requires all of these qualities. There needs to be entire banishment of envy and greed from the hearts of those who would undertake it. How many are able to maintain the unselfishness necessary to bring about such a desirable condition? 

Then, there is the doctrine of communism, which is more extreme. Under such a system the properties of others might be forcibly taken for its adherents, and control exercised in all matters pertaining to labor, religion, and social relations. Some English writer, in a satirical mood, has given the following definition of communism in the extreme: 

"What is a communist? One who has yearnings 
For an equal division of unequal earnings; 
Sluggard or scoundrel, or both, he is willing 
To fork out his penny and pocket your shilling." 

Such a description may not apply to many people, but it does apply to some who are selfish and covetous in their desires, and are not willing to do their part in helping to earn and to promote the welfare of the entire community. 

CHURCH STANDS FOR GREATER EQUALITY 

It is desirable, as stated by President Nibley this morning, that, there should be greater equality of wealth, and greater consideration on the part of those who have means in giving for the benefit of those who are not so favorably situated. Consideration by men for their fellows must be ingrained in them by some power other than politics, and that must, apparently, be through religion. The Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught and practiced by this people is, in my judgment, the most effective means for the promotion of greater mutual interest. The Church stands for greater equality and cooperation among mankind, without in any way interfering with individual initiative. Any legislation that will help to promote the mutual welfare of all, and control the aggrandizement of wealth is, in my judgment, fully justified. Faithful Church members show continually their consideration for others by the spirit of brotherly kindness, and by material contributions for the temporal and spiritual welfare of their fellows. 

GOSPEL PROMOTES SPIRIT OF CONSECRATION 

The teachings of "Mormonism" are and always have been of such character as to stimulate in those who accept them the spirit of consecration of their time, means and efforts to the welfare of others as well as themselves. The observance of the principle of tithing, of fasting and fast offerings, relief of those in need, the missionary work, community building, all help to promote, through service to the Lord, the interests of our fellow members. 

OBEY THE LAW OF TITHING 

We have been continually encouraged to obey the law of tithing. It is a most effective test of our faith in God and his work. It helps to raise us to higher standards. It is a means for our temporal as well as our spiritual progress. Obedience to this law will aid us to conserve our property and to develop prudence and foresight in our affairs. The prophet Malachi declared anciently that if the Hebrews would observe this principle faithfully they should be materially blessed and the Lord would rebuke the devourer for their sakes. 

If we accept the principle of tithing in a half-hearted way, fearing that we are going to give too much or are making too great a sacrifice, we shall not enjoy the blessings which the Lord has promised. But if we give liberally in the spirit of that principle we shall be blessed. President Brigham Young declared on one occasion: "I would not give the ashes of a rye straw for the man who feels that he is making sacrifice for God. We are doing this for our own happiness, welfare and exaltation, and nobody's else." Every principle of the Gospel is a privilege for us. It is a means for our growth and development, and if we shall observe it we shall enjoy the blessings that follow.  

CULTIVATE CONTRITENESS OF SPIRIT 

My brethren and sisters, I think we should accept and observe the counsels that are given to us by the Presidency of the Church and the other leaders who are inspired of God. In the spirit of humility we should cultivate the faith and repentance which is necessary in order that we may walk uprightly and in accordance with the will of the Lord. I am reminded of a statement in the Book of Mormon where the voice of the Lord declared unto the people: "Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit." And Kipling in that wonderful poem, "The Recessional," after the great celebration in England at the time of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, reminded the people: 

"Still stands thine ancient sacrifice, 
An humble and a contrite heart . . . 
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 
Lest we forget, — lest we forget." 

May the Lord help each of us firmly to resolve in our hearts and minds that "as for me and my house we will serve the Lord," I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

The words of the first hymn that we sang this morning are by Sister Eliza R. Snow, who at one time was President of the Relief Societies of the Church. The music was composed by Brother George Careless. The words of the hymn we have just sung are by Sister Emmeline B. Wells, one of the successors to Sister Snow in the presidency of the Relief Societies. The music to this hymn was composed by the late Evan Stephens. 

Personally, I am very grateful for the wonderful inspiration of our brethren and sisters who have written the words and composed the music for so many of our inspired hymns.

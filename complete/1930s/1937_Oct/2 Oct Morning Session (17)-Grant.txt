I feel profoundly impressed to endorse the remarks by Brother Widtsoe. I have often remarked that but for the splendid characters that come from the farms to the cities, the cities would die of their own immoral weight. The larger the city, as a rule, the greater the amount of crime. The more a man loves the farm and lives on it, the healthier in spirit and body he is. I longed as a young man to live on a farm, but I have never cultivated an acre of land, so of course I cannot talk from experience; but I can say that the majority of our missionaries come from the farms, notwithstanding the farmers do not produce a majority of the money. This shows where the real, genuine faith is. 

I am going to bring something from a great statesman to read to you this afternoon.

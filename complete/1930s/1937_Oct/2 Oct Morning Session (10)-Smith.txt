PERILOUS TIMES 

We are living in perilous times. The conditions in many parts of the world are as uncertain and disturbed as they could be without armed conflict. Spain is involved in civil war at the present time. That is not far from where the Savior of the world lived in mortality, where the Gospel of peace was preached by him and his disciples, and where thousands of people undoubtedly heard the truth from the lips of the Master himself or from those whom he sent when he told them to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, and they that believed and were baptized would be saved and they that believed not would be damned. Nearly two thousand years have passed since that warning was delivered and the great majority of the inhabitants of the earth are not yet converted to the message of love, but the destructive power of the adversary intensifies as the years roll by. 

I stand before you exceedingly nervous, realizing what a responsibility is mine, and pray for the inspiration of the Lord that we may all be edified by what we hear and feel. 

REPENTANCE AND HUMILITY NEEDED 

As we analyze the situation we must come to the conclusion that there never was a time in the world's history when there was greater necessity everywhere for men to repent of their sins and seek the guidance of our Heavenly Father. There has never been a time since the Church was organized when there was greater need for us to humble ourselves before the Lord and seek his guidance. 

There are many people who think themselves competent to lead us out of our difficulties and without hesitation they come forward with suggestions to try this or that as an experiment. And yet our Heavenly Father has advised us that the only plan that will produce satisfactory results and take us back into his presence is the plan of eternal life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as advocated by his beloved Son. 

The wisdom of the world is not sufficient. What we need in the midst of our distresses is the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. And how shall we obtain it? Will it be by selfishness? I think not. Will we obtain it by arrogance, unmindful of the rights of others? Certainly not. Will we obtain it by fault finding and criticizing those who are seeking unselfishly to bless mankind? No, never. The Lord has told us that we may obtain the inspiration that we always need by living righteous lives and by prayer and thanksgiving. He has said that when even two or three shall meet together in his name he will be there to bless them. This great audience of thousands of people has met in the name of the Lord and I have no doubt that he will bless us. 

This is a glorious autumn day. Outside the sun is shining, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, and inside this great Tabernacle there is peace and quiet and the spirit of worship. With all my heart I feel to thank my Heavenly Father that I am here. 

THE PATHWAY TO THE CELESTIAL KINGDOM 

The Lord, when he placed our first parents on the earth, gave them instructions and from time to time he has sent his prophets to counsel their descendants. We have in the Old and the New Testament the teachings of the Lord, not of man, but the advice of our Heavenly Father intended to direct us along the pathway that will eventually terminate in the celestial kingdom. How wonderful it is to know that there is a pathway leading to a glorious kingdom. 

The Ten Commandments given to ancient Israel are a guide to safety and eternal happiness. Whenever we violate any of them we are not in the narrow way. We are told that strait is the gate and narrow the way which leadeth unto life, and if we would be in that narrow way we must keep his commandments. 

When Jesus of Nazareth was upon the earth he pleaded with men to live righteous lives in preparation for immortality, and he gave his life, demonstrating that he was not afraid to die and that the resurrection was a reality, and after he was raised from the dead he continued to advise the people how to live and when they have followed that advice they have rejoiced in the blessings of mortal life and in the assurance of eternal life. 

THE PRICE OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS 

The Book of Mormon tells us that there was one long period of time when the people were righteous and that was the two hundred years after the appearance of our Savior on this western hemisphere. They repented of their sins, turned to the Lord and were prosperous and happy. 

When the Gospel of Jesus Christ was established in this dispensation the Lord repeated what he has said so many times in the Old and New Testaments, that the price of peace and happiness is righteousness. Notwithstanding that knowledge there are many who appear to think that we can obtain happiness in some other way but we should all know by this time that there is no other way and only sorrow and disappointment will result from disobeying the Father of our spirits. We live in a day when there are many temptations to evil and each one who submits himself to any of them loses a blessing. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation from our Heavenly Father called the Word of Wisdom in which we are advised not to use stimulants and narcotics. There are some among us who ignore the advice given in that revelation and drink liquor and use tobacco, knowing that the penalty must be paid and the blessing forfeited that would follow obedience. Why is it that it is so difficult for some people to comprehend that there is no happiness or benefit in violating the wise counsel of our Heavenly Father? 

He has taught us that we must observe the Sabbath Day to keep it holy. One day of the seven he has set apart as his day, and in consideration of all his blessings bestowed upon us on the other days it would appear to me that we ought to find joy in doing the things that he asks us to do on his holy day, and I believe that unless we do we will find no happiness that is worthy of the name. He wants us to be happy and has told us how we may earn that happiness. 

FLYING IN A FOG 

One day I boarded an airplane at Los Angeles. It was foggy and they held us on the ground for some time, but finally word came that we might start. The plane taxied down the field, left the ground, soared up into the air and ascended above the fog into glorious sunshine. We could see the top of a mountain that gave the pilot our direction toward Salt Lake City. 

We were soon crossing Nevada. The view from the plane was delightful. Near Milford, Utah, we suddenly flew into one of the worst fogs I have ever seen. I tried to look out of the window of the plane but could not see anything through the fog. Not a thing could be seen in any direction outside the plane. 

I knew that we were approaching the mountains at the approximate rate of three miles a minute, that we were compelled to pass over them to get into the Salt Lake Valley. I was worried and asked myself, "How can the pilot find the way when he cannot see a thing?" He had his compass but the plane might drift off its course. He had instruments indicating our distance above sea level but he had no way of knowing how far we were from the ground. I thought he might fly high enough to clear the mountains between us and the Salt Lake Valley and try to find the landing field by the flash of the beacons if we got close enough, but I chilled when I thought of the danger of losing our way and missing the beacons and the airport. 

AN ELECTRIC HIGHWAY 

In my anxiety I went up into the space that was occupied by the pilot and the co-pilot to see how they knew where we were going. I could not tell whether we were a hundred feet, a thousand feet or ten thousand feet above the ground and I did not know how they could tell, except approximately. I noticed that the pilot had a little device over his ear like operators in telephone offices use to receive with. I inquired of the co-pilot how they could tell whether we were flying in the right direction or know if we were off course. He replied, "When we cannot see we are guided by the radio beam." "What is that?" I asked. He explained that the beam might be likened to an electric highway between two points and in our case the points were Milford and Salt Lake City. He said that the device over the pilot's ear operated so that when the plane was in the beam a low, purring sound continued to be heard, but if the plane goes to the right or left the sound changes and the pilot is warned by a clicking as of a telegraph key. If he hears two dots and a dash he knows he is leaving the beam to the right; if two dashes and a dot he is leaving the beam to the left and he immediately pulls back to the beam or highway, on to the path of safety, the clicking ceases and the purring resumes. If we continue on the beam we will arrive at our destination in safety. 

I returned to my seat greatly comforted to know that notwithstanding we were enveloped in fog and darkness and could neither see nor feel where we were the pilot was receiving information constantly that we were on the highway and he knew that we would soon arrive at our destination. A few minutes later I felt the plane descending. We had passed over the mountain tops and were nearing the airport. When we were nearly down we could see the powerful lights of the field indicating where to land and the plane with its precious cargo touched the ground gently as a seagull lights on water, slowly came to a stop and we stepped from our conveyance to the ground, happy to be at home again. 

Not long after the trip I have described to you another passenger plane flying from Los Angeles to Salt Lake over the same course became lost in the darkness. For some unknown reason the pilot failed to follow the radio beam. They crashed on a granite peak about twenty-five miles south of here and it was months before any of the bodies were recovered. 

FOLLOWING THE CHARTED COURSE 

I have thought many times of the lesson I learned on the plane and have applied it to experience in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are passengers on the good ship Zion. Jesus Christ, our Lord, is the real pilot. He charted the course; he knows every island and rock on the way and has placed beacons to guide us safely to our destination. 

Notwithstanding the fact that we are members of his Church we will not obtain an inheritance in the celestial kingdom except on condition that we follow the course that he has charted. Each of the Ten Commandments is a beacon warning us of danger. The Word of Wisdom is a beacon for our guidance and protection, as are all the counsels of the Lord to us. If we are living as we know that we should we are entitled to the whispering of a still small voice calling attention to danger saying this is the pathway of safety, walk ye in it. We are not in that pathway when we profane, when we disobey the Lord's command to keep the Sabbath Day holy or when we are unjust to one another. If we have erred in our conduct the voice will whisper to us "turn back, you have made a mistake; you have disregarded the advice of your Heavenly Father." Turn from the error of your way while there is yet time, for if you go too far from the right path you will not hear the voice and you may be hopelessly lost and be wrecked, even as the pilot and his precious cargo were when they lost their way. 

Because of his love for us our Savior has done everything to protect us from the effects of evil, even to the giving of his life, but he will not take from us our agency. 

As members of this Church we may not excuse ourselves as the people of the world may who have not been properly taught and do not understand. Millions of God's children have not charts and compass as we have, but he organized his Church and offers membership and invites all to come into it and to be with him on the good ship Zion, with the promise that in obedience to his commandments there will flow peace, happiness and eternal life in his celestial kingdom. 

Shall we be careless? Shall we use things which God has forbidden? Shall we dishonor his holy day? Shall we neglect our prayers? Shall we take advantage of our neighbors? Shall we do the things that the Lord has told us not to do, when we know that by so conducting ourselves we may lose his spirit and we ourselves be lost? 

THE PILOT OF THE CHURCH 

Not only has the Lord given us the advice already recorded in the scriptures to guide us but he has placed as a leader in this Church, one of his sons who has been chosen and ordained and set apart to be the President. He is our pilot and he will be directed by a voice that will enable him to lead us where we should go. If we are wise we will not set up our judgment against him but will be happy to honor him in his place as long as the Lord sustains him. We have had misguided souls in the Church who have, in their ignorance, opposed the advice of the pilot, not sensing the fact that they were opposing the Lord and they have fallen into darkness and sorrow, and unless they repent they will not find a place in the celestial kingdom. 

Let us remember that the President of this Church has been officially designated as the pilot of the Church here in mortality to represent the Master of heaven and earth. 

THE PATHWAY TO PEACE 

My advice to you is to get the Spirit of God and keep it and the only way we will retain it is by living near him, by keeping his commandments and in these days of uncertainty when men are running to and fro seeking for some new plan by which peace may be brought into the world know this that the only way to peace for this world is the pathway of the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. There is no other. We have the instruments to operate the ship. We have the information including a map with every danger charted and if we will go forward day by day rejoicing in the companionship of one another, winning by our upright lives the love and confidence of our families and neighbors until the time comes when we have completed the period assigned to us here we will arrive at our heavenly home and be made welcome by our Heavenly Father. To possess a knowledge of the truth is worth all the wealth of the world, to know that we are on the safe highway when we are in the pathway of duty as defined by our Heavenly Father, and to know that we can continue there if we will, regardless of the influences and inducements that may be offered by those who have not been appointed to be our leaders, is a blessing that is priceless. 

AVOIDING THE PITFALLS 

God bless you, my brethren, who are presidents of stakes and bishops of wards, you who preside over quorums, you who are called to take charge in the auxiliary organizations, both men and women. Be humble and prayerful, that you may avoid the pitfalls that the adversary prepares for your feet. Listen to the still small voice that will always direct you if you are worthy of it in a path that means eternal happiness. My soul is filled with gratitude this day to know that as we continue our membership in the Church we do have a pilot who knows the way, and if we will follow his direction we will not land on the side of the mountain to be crushed nor descend to the depths to be drowned; we will not meet the spiritual disasters that the world is meeting but we will go about doing good, blessing mankind, and rejoicing in the companionship of those we love. 

That the Lord will continue to bless the man who stands at the head of this Church together with his counselors and those that associate with them, that they may be inspired to see eye to eye in righteousness, and that we who are members may be wise enough not to jump overboard but that we may stay with the good ship Zion as it follows its course and help keep that course where the Lord would have it to be to the end that we may all find our place in the celestial kingdom when our labors in mortality are completed, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

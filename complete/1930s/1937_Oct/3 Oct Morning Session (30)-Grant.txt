I have been invited to attend conferences of the foreign-speaking peoples. I want the Dutch people to know that I am Dutch when I go far enough back on my mother's side, so I am interested in the Dutch people. There are some Scandinavians in my family through marriage, so I am interested in the Scandinavians. The German people have given to us some of our most stalwart and outstanding people, and I am deeply interested in them; but I beg these dear friends of mine to please remember that in a little more than a month I will be 81 years of age, and that when a man my age attends each of these General Conference sessions he is doing all that he should. You are all praying for the Lord to prolong my life. Please do not ask me to do things that will shorten it.

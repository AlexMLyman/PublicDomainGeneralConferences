EXPENSIVE AND INJURIOUS HABITS 

We are all looking for a solution of our great financial troubles. Here is one of the troubles that cost us approximately $7,150,000,000 during the year 1936. The values given are approximate retail values. 

Alcohol: Between $4,000,000,000 and 5,000,000,000. 

Tobacco: Cigarets, 139,968,648,406 consumed in 1936. That means 139.9 cigarets a minute for every minute from the birth of the Savior until now. 

Cigars: 4,863,191,852, or 4.8 cigars every minute from the birth of the Savior until now. 

18,030 tons of snuff. 

(The fire losses in the United States for the year 1936, as estimated by the insurance companies, were only $30,000,000.) 

Approximate retail value of tobacco consumed in the United States in 1936, $1,500,000,000. Worse than burning up that much property, because every person that used tobacco injured himself. 

Coffee and tea: Coffee, 1,739,184,000 pounds. This is equivalent to 3 grams of caffein for every adult. 

Tea: 82,000,000 pounds. 

Retail value of coffee and tea together, approximately $650,000,000. 

Total for alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, approximately $7,150,000,000 or seven and a fraction dollars a minute for every minute from the birth of the Savior until now. 

Do you not think the Lord knew what he was talking about when he gave the Word of Wisdom for our temporal salvation? If you do not, study more, read more, pray more. 

REGARDING TILLERS OF THE SOIL 

I was delighted with what Brother Widtsoe said this morning, and by the way, I thank the Lord that Brother Widtsoe gave me these figures. I did not know that there was that much used. 

The United States of America was cradled by the plowed field — a capable cradle. In the days of Washington and Jefferson it is likely that at least four-fifths of all Americans were farm folk. From this fact our first statesmen took effective cues. Thomas Jefferson, preeminent among our bards of prose, said: 

"Cultivators of earth make the best citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most virtuous, and the most independent. They are tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests with the most lasting bonds. 

"They are not soap-box orators, not one of them. A farm is what makes a man loyal to his country. A soap-box orator is a man that stirs up trouble. 

"As long, therefore, as they can find employment in that line, I would not counsel them to be mariners, artizans, or anything else." 

This saying lived long as the gospel of American leadership, as well as of politics. 

God grant that it may return. 

A FAVORABLE MAGAZINE ARTICLE 

I have been reading from "Roots of America," by Charles Morrow Wilson. I hope that the majority of you have read Mr. Wilson's article in the September 4th issue of the Saturday Evening Post. It is one of the most enlightening and splendid things ever written by a non-member of the Church in any of our magazines. The young man came to Utah and was in my office a number of times, and went down to Hurricane and looked into the marvelous work done by the people at Hurricane. Then he wrote this very favorable article — one of the best I have ever read.

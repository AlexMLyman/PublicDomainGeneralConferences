THE PASSING OF JOHN W. HART 

Word has come to me that this morning at about 5 o'clock President John W. Hart of the Rigby Stake of Zion, and for many years a member of the Auditing Committee of the Church, passed away due to a heart attack. 

Brother Hart was true, faithful and diligent from his youth to the time of his death. He was a pioneer in Idaho in early days when there was little but sagebrush to be seen as far as the eye could reach. He lived to erect one of our largest and finest stake houses, and was faithful to every duty and responsibility that rested upon him. 

When the fearful hardships of the depression came and the bank of which he was the president failed, he gave practically everything he had that the depositors should lose nothing. He was a God-fearing, faithful, true man. 

I want to endorse all the good things that have been said about the singing during this conference.

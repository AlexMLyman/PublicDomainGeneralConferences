It may be of interest to those who do not already know it that this song of fourteen verses, by Montgomery, was sung in Carthage Jail by John Taylor; after he had finished singing it he was asked to sing it again. He replied that he did not feel like singing, he was oppressed with a sense of coming disaster; but at Hyrum's request he sang the hymn again. 

Soon after he was through singing it the second time, the shooting started that ended in the death of the Prophet and the Patriarch, and the wounding of President Taylor.

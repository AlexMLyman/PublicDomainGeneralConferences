I was playing golf with the son of the late Governor of the State of Missouri, Mr. Crittendon, and he gave me a pamphlet in which he marked the record of a certain battlefield near Kansas City, and he said to me: "Mr. Grant, it might interest you to know that you are playing on your own property; the title to this golf links is in the Presiding Bishop of the Mormon Church." 

TITLE BY ADVERSE POSSESSION 

I was in Kansas City at the time for the purpose of delivering a lecture before the Chamber of Commerce, and in my remarks I quoted the Articles of Faith of the Church, and I announced that I held the title — or at least the Presiding Bishop of the Mormon Church did — to a little more than one-half the entire city of Kansas City, but lo and behold, I could not get any of that property because there is a law to the effect that adverse possession gives title to the person having such possession. But they cannot get a good abstract, as the title traces back to the name of Edward Partridge, Presiding Bishop of the Mormon Church. 

Some day, perhaps, Uncle Sam, seeing that we paid our money for that land, may give us our money back, but I doubt it.

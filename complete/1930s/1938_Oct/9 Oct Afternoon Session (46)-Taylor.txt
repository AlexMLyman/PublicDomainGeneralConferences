May I relate these two instances: 

Last week I had the opportunity of going into the Missionary Home for a day or two and meeting the splendid missionaries who were about to leave for the mission field. Yesterday, one of the missionaries looked for me all day and when I went over to my missionary reunion he was waiting with his father at the door. Because of something I had said or done, he desired that I be the one to ordain him to the office of Seventy. 

When I was twenty years of age and went on my first mission, as I came out of the meeting that had been held for my farewell, an old lady who was earning her living by washing stood by the door with a shawl over her head. She put a dollar into my hand and said to me, "John, it is not very much but I would like you to have it. I hope I shall live to welcome you back again, for when I go I would like you to say something about me at my funeral, because I love you." 

The good things we say and the good things we do bring us happiness and joy. When we say evil things or do evil things in life, we are ashamed and uncomfortable. 

May the Lord help us to be faithful and true to the fine things in life, so that we might be helpful to our fellow men, I humbly pray, in Jesus' name, Amen.

I know I speak for the First Council of Seventy when I welcome Brother Richard L. Evans as one of our members. I have known him for many years. His noble character and fine intellect have been an influence for good wherever he has gone. His father died when Richard was a little boy, and was one of the truest men that ever lived. Richard's mother has reared a large family. She has faced sorrows with fortitude, but always with deep faith in the ways of Providence. 

May I say to President Grant and all the brethren under whose direction the First Council works, that the Seventies throughout the Church are doing nobly in their quorum activities, and have risen to the call to carry the Gospel into the homes of all people. 

To my brethren of the respective quorums, I should like to remind you of the words of Paul the Apostle to Timothy, when he said:

When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 

Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 

For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 

That we may go forward in carrying out the wishes of the First Presidency and the quorum of the Twelve to the end that thousands, yea millions, of the children of men may be brought to the knowledge of the truth, I ask in His name. Amen.

Again I express my gratitude for the singing that we have had, for the wonderful "Elijah" oratorio, for the fine speeches that we have heard, for the marvelous attendance at this Conference, and for the blessings of the Lord that have been with us. 

INVOKES BLESSINGS OPON THE PEOPLE 

I rejoice beyond all else in the growth of faith among the Latter-day Saints, and with all the power and authority that God has bestowed upon me — and I know as I know that I live that he has directed me from boyhood, that he has heard and answered my prayers, that I have had revelations, so to speak, from the Lord, and have endeavored to carry them out — I pray God to bless every honest-hearted soul at home or abroad. I pray that what has been said here may sink deep into the hearts of the people, that we will judge not that we be not judged, and that we will not condemn people in any of the countries today that are doing things that we think they ought not to do, because many of them are doing what they are doing because they dare not do otherwise, and are just as much opposed to it as we are. 

May the spirit of peace and brotherly love grow among the Latter-day Saints. 

Again may I plead with the people to get down on their knees and ask God to direct them in every act of life, and then if they get the Spirit of God they will feel happy and content in what they do. Do not do something that you can not ask God to help you to do. Grow in the light and knowledge of the Gospel, and as a servant of God I promise you peace and joy and happiness, in the name of our Redeemer, Amen.

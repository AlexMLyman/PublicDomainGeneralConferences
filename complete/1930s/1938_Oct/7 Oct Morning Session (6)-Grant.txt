We were very grateful for the splendid attendance at the Elijah oratorio last night. I was greatly disappointed at the attendance the night before. When I thought of the thousands and tens of thousands of hours that our good brethren and sisters of the choir have devoted without financial reward, I was humiliated with the first night's attendance. These tabernacle choir and organ broadcasts are the greatest advertisement for Utah that could possibly be given, and the Choir gives its services free. Every time the Choir gives a concert here we should come and support it, and if we would buy some additional tickets and give them away it would be a good thing. 

URGES CARE BE EXERCISED ON STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 

I would like to warn each and all of you to be careful. To the utter disgrace of Utah we lead the whole nation in automobile accidents. It is a shame, we should be the most careful and the most considerate people. I hope that we will be very careful in crossing the streets. I have been traveling time and time again at twenty-five miles an hour, when that was the speed limit, and have had people pass me like I was hitched to a post.

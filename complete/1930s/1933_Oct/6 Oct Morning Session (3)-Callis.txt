Brethren and sisters, I stand before you in the depths of humility. I did not receive an inkling that my name would be presented this morning, and I feel one of the weakest of God's creatures. 

The first miraculous manifestation I received when I was a youth was through President Heber J. Grant when he delivered a sermon in Coalville in the Summit Stake of Zion. The President, whom I dearly love, has always made a profound impression upon me in my life. I love all of the General Authorities of the Church. I know that they are men of God. I know, too, as sure as I stand here that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I know by the same power that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. I am in absolute harmony with all that the General Authorities of the Church have done. 

Brethren and sisters, I desire to spend my time in your service. 

God help me to always be faithful and humble, and to always love his people and his work, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

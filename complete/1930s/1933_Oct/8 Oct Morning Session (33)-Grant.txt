For the very first time during my administration I have not had to tell anyone how long he should talk. I am very happy indeed that we have got this far along without limiting any of our brethren, but they have had the opportunity of saying as much as they wanted to say. 

However, I am thoroughly converted in my own mind that the reason we have done so well is that two of the Apostles are in Europe and one other is sick. I think that accounts for it. 

According to the count that was made, there were 10,784 people in the building at this morning's session. 

Many of the good people whose sons and daughters are in the mission field are anxious to meet the Mission Presidents. I shall ask Brother Joseph S. Peery to open a room in the Bureau of Information where the Mission Presidents can meet any of the Saints who want to inquire regarding their missionary sons and daughters. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

After announcing that the choir would sing the anthem, "Song of the Redeemed," by Evan Stephens, President Grant made this comment: 

Three years ago, at the Sunday morning session of the Conference, this song was sung by the choir under the direction of the author, Professor Evan Stephens, who shortly after returning to his home, following the meeting, became ill and later passed away. We owe a very deep debt of gratitude to Brother Evan Stephens, Brother George Careless, Brother Ebenezer Beesley, Brother Joseph J. Daynes, and many others for the marvelous music they have composed.

The Columbia Broadcasting Company has been very good to us. They have given us, free of charge, a national broadcast for our choir. If we had to pay for it this broadcast would cost us tens of thousands of dollars every month, if not every week. Not only have they given us free for this purpose a half hour each week, but some months ago they requested that we increase our broadcast from a half hour to an hour. 

They have now asked permission to shut us off the air, so far as this meeting is concerned, fifteen minutes from now. Therefore, the last five or ten minutes of Brother Ballard's remarks will be heard by this audience only. We dislike to deprive those who are listening to the radio broadcast of the privilege of hearing the last part of Brother Ballard's remarks, but if they wish to read his remarks they can do so in the newspaper or in the Conference Pamphlet, as they will be published. 

We feel that we owe the Columbia Broadcasting Company this courtesy, otherwise a great many people as far distant as the Hawaiian Islands would be deprived of the opportunity of listening to the report of the baseball game.

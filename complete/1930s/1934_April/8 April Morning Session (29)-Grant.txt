Elders George F. Richards and Stephen L. Richards are absent on account of illness. Brother Joseph F. Merrill as you all know is absent in Europe, presiding over the European Mission. 

As near as we are able to judge, hundreds of thousands of people have listened to the broadcast this morning, and we appreciate very much their doing so. I wish to re-echo the fine compliments that have been paid to our choir. We appreciate very very much the good work that they are doing. 

As a closing number the Choir sang the anthem "Grant us Peace, O Lord," â€” soprano solo by Laurinda Brewerton. 

The music to which we have just listened was composed by Evan Stephens. I wish that as far as possible we would get into the habit of singing our own music, that is, music composed by our own people. There are an inspiration and spirit which accompany the music of George Careless, Evan Stephens, Joseph J. Daynes and others of our own composers that I sometimes think we do not get from those not of our faith.

I have withheld the statistics that I am now about to read to you until the Presiding Bishop made his report. 

TO RELIEVE DISTRESS 

These figures show what has been done by the Church during the nine months from September 30th, 1931 to June 30th, 1932, in order that the distress to which he has referred might be relieved. 

Ten Stakes of Salt Lake County, all within this valley, have contributed as follows: 

From Fast offerings, $34,026.86. 

From Relief Society donations, $28,470.56. 

From the tithes which you, my brethren and sisters, have paid into the storehouse of the Lord, $105,114.27. 

There has been disbursed by the ten stakes in Salt Lake valley for the relief of those in distress $177,437.70. 

There has been contributed by the people of the other stakes of the Church: 

In fast offerings, $76,071.76. 

Through the Relief Society, $58,000.59. 

From the tithes, $32,018.89. 

Total amount paid by the Church during this period from fast offerings alone, $110,098.62. 

If we all paid our fast offerings as we should there would be sufficient, I believe, to take care of those who are in actual need. 

There was received from the Relief Society $86,471.15. 

There was received from the tithes paid in the various stakes. $137,133.16. 

The total amount contributed during the past ten months from the tithes and offerings of the people to those who are in need is $361,242.79. It does not need comment to satisfy you, I am certain, that the members of the Church are doing their duty as far as attention to those who are in their communities who are in need is concerned.

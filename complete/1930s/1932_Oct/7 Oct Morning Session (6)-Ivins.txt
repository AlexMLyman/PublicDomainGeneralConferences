Before concluding the services I desire to call your attention to a slight deviation that will be made in the ordinary proceeding on Sunday morning. Arrangements have been made that on each Sunday morning there will be a national broadcast of musical numbers from the Tabernacle. On next Sunday we therefore request that you be present a few minutes before ten o'clock, when this broadcast will begin, and you will be entertained by it during the first thirty minutes, which will include the regular proceedings of the conference in part, after which the regular conference program will be continued. 

I make this announcement at this time because it is possible that some of you may not be here tomorrow and we would like if possible to have you all present before ten o'clock, or not later than ten o'clock, on Sunday morning, for the reason that during this broadcast which goes over the world it is necessary that the strictest attention be observed and that there be as little confusion and noise as possible.

I asked for a list to be furnished me of people prominent in the Church who had passed away since our last Conference. I am surprised to find that the name of P. Rulon Christensen, president of the French Mission, was omitted. He filled a very splendid mission and we are grateful for his fine labors. We extend our sympathy to his family. 

I am also surprised that I myself did not think of one of the general officers of the Church, one of the assistant historians, Brother Junius F. Wells, the instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, by direction of President Brigham Young, of traveling all over the Church and establishing the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. It fell to my lot to be one of the officers of the first Mutual Improvement Association of the young men, organized by Brother Wells. Three of the four officers are living today, Counselor B. Morris Young, Hyrum H. Goddard, the Secretary, and myself. Henry A. Woolley, the President, has passed away. 

I was intimately associated as a partner in business and in a church capacity with Junius F. Wells, nearly all of my life. I never heard him speak an unkind word of anyone. If he could not speak good of people he said nothing. He did us honor and credit wherever he traveled at home or abroad. He was a worthy son of a worthy father. His heart and soul were wrapped up in Mutual Improvement work. He gave to that work the very best that was in him. It is a source of regret to me that I could not be present at his funeral. May the blessings of the Lord attend his family.

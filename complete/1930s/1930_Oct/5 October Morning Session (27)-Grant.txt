There are four brethren who have returned from missions who have not yet reported â€” Brother Andrew Johnson from the Swedish Mission, Brother J. A. Cahoon from the Tongan Mission, Brother Hyrum W. Valentine from the German-Austrian Mission, and Brother Edward P. Kimball from the German-Austrian Mission. We will ask these brethren if they are here to come to the stand and address us, occupying not more that ten minutes each in their remarks. Brother Valentine will be the next speaker after the Choir sings the first hymn in our hymn book, entitled, "The Morning Breaks, the Shadows Flee." 

This hymn occupies a place of honor in our hymn book, and I think, justly. Brother George Careless, a former leader of the Choir, composed the music. As there are only twenty lines to the hymn, I am going to take the time to read it all. 

"The morning breaks, the shadows flee; Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. The dawning of a brighter day, Majestic rises on the world. 

"The clouds of error disappear Before the rays of truth divine; The glory bursting from afar, Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 

"The Gentile fulness now conies in. And Israel's blessings are at hand; Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin, Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

"Jehovah speaks! let earth give ear, And Gentile nations turn and live; His mighty arm is making bare, His covenant people to receive. 

"Angels from heaven and truth from earth Have met and both have record borne; Thus Zion's light is bursting forth, To bring her ransomed children home."

I failed to read one brief statement of statistics in my opening remarks. There have been two changes in Stake Presidents: Elder David I Stoddard has been chosen to succeed Brother William D. Hanks as President of the Union Stake; and Brother William O. Bentley has been chosen to succeed Brother Joseph K. Nicholes as President of St. George Stake. Brother Stoddard opened this meeting with prayer, and Brother Bentley will offer the benediction. 

Elder William M. Waddoups has been released as President of the Hawaiian Mission, and also as President of the Hawaiian temple, and Brother Castle H. Murphy has been appointed to succeed him. 

Elder Edward P. Kimball has been released as President of the German-Austrian Mission, and Elder Oliver H. Budge has been appointed to succeed him. 

There have been two new wards organized â€” the Fourth Ward of Richfield, Sevier Stake, and Helper Ward, Carbon Stake. Bishops who have passed away during the past six months: 

Rulon M. Jensen of the Basalt Ward, Shelley Stake. 

Karl N. Snow of East St. George Ward, St. George Stake. 

We now have 104 Stakes of Zion; 933 Wards; 71 Independent Branches, making a total of 1004. There are Dependent Branches, 41; Missions, 29, Branches in the Missions, 835. Total Wards, Branches and Missions, 1909. 

All of the brethren who have been honorably released are released with the love and blessing and thanks of the General Authorities for the splendid work that they have done. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Our Mountain Home So Dear." Benediction by Elder William O. Bentley, President of the St. George Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock this afternoon. 

Amen.

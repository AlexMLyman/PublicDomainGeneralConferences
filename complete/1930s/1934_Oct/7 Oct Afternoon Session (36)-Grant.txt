It is four years ago since Evan Stephens became sick while at conference, returned to his home, and passed away. We will now sing his anthem, "Let the Mountains shout for joy." GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I feel that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to Evan Stephens, George Careless, Joseph J. Daynes, and many others, for the splendid music they have prepared for our hymns and our anthems. 

The choir then sang the anthem, "Let the mountains shout for joy."

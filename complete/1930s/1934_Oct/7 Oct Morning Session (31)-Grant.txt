I would like to announce, as many of you may not be informed, that Brother Rufus K. Hardy is now presiding over the New Zealand Mission, which is the reason he does not appear on the stand. 

I wish to say for Brother Hardy that he is a man who is loved by all who know him. The older members of the Council of Seventy have nominated Brother Hardy, and we are very pleased indeed to approve their nomination. He is a tried and true Latter-day Saint. He had one of the most remarkable and splendid mothers. All of the rest of us have been talking about our mothers, so I will talk about his. 

Annie K. Hardy was an outstanding woman.

President Grant announced that the choir and congregation would sing the hymn, "School thy feelings, O my brother." This hymn, the President said, was written by Elder Charles W. Penrose after he had given ten years of his life as a missionary, without purse or scrip. When he started on his mission he lent his furniture to the British Mission, and after completing ten years of missionary work he took back his battered furniture, it having been used by the elders during this time, and sold it to get money with which to help him immigrate to Utah. He was accused of stealing the furniture out of the British Mission home. He went home and wrote this hymn for his own consolation.

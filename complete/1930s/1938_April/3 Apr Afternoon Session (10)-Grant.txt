Elders George Albert Smith and Rufus K. Hardy have sent us a number of fine telegrams since they left. They are both in the enjoyment of splendid health and are being received with enthusiasm by the good people of the Pacific islands. They send their love and very best wishes not only to us but to all the people. 

Elder Richard R. Lyman is thoroughly enjoying his mission. He is doing a great work in Europe and sends his best wishes also.

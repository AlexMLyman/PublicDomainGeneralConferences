PRESIDING BISHOPRIC

It is only fair to say to the good people here that during the administration of Bishop Sylvester Q. Cannon and his counselors the affairs of the Church have been managed in a most wonderful and splendid manner, that we have had more buildings erected than in any other similar period since the erection of these buildings has been placed under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric, that the work has been done much better and at much less expense in proportion to the kind of buildings than at any previous time. 

The Presidency have appreciated the great burden of work that was lifted from their shoulders and placed upon the shoulders of the Presiding Bishopric a few years ago, and the Bishopric have done that work in a splendid manner. We appreciate it beyond our power to express it.

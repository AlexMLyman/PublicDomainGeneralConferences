I rejoice beyond expression at the wonderful outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord, from our first meeting until the close. The Lord has abundantly blessed each and all of us who have been called upon to speak. 

I bless you, as far as the power is in me to do so — and I know that I have it — I know as I know the Gospel is true that the Lord wanted me to preside over this Church. Brother Joseph F. Smith's last few words to me, and the last he gave to any man were: "The Lord knows whom he wants to preside over his Church, and he never makes a mistake." By the power of the Priesthood of the living God I bless you, one and all, and the righteous and honorable men and women all over the world, even so. Amen.

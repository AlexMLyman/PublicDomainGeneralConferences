I am very grateful myself, and I am sure that you all are, to the Singing Mothers for the lovely music to which we have listened; we appreciate it very much indeed. 

AVOID AUTO ACCIDENTS 

Our City Fathers have requested us one and all to be careful of automobile accidents. I want to ask as a personal favor that people quit breaking the speed limit in this city. If they happen to see a green light you would think that someone was dying, the way they try to get there before it changes to a red light; you would think that life and death were at stake. I have had automobiles pass me time and time again when I was going just the speed limit, and then they generally get to the light too late and the red light comes on. If the city would pass an ordinance to the effect that every one should send in the name of every man who passes him breaking the speed limit, trying to get through the green light, and if they would take the testimony of that one person, provided there was no other person to testify to it, I think they would collect in fines about a thousand dollars a day in this city. There is no necessity to break the speed limit, none whatever, and of course there is no necessity of always trying to get your right-of-way when it is your turn. 

Here lies the body of William Gray, 
Who died maintaining his right of way. 
Now William was right as he sped along, 
But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong. 

Let the other fellow have the right-of-way.

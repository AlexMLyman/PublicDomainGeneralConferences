Someone has said that in every group or gathering will be found someone to say a good word for California. We barely made it today. 

I am honored to bring to you the greetings of one hundred and twenty-three missionaries and nearly eleven thousand Saints in the great California Mission. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is being carried forward and the Church is being planted all over that goodly land. There are fifty-five organized branches of the Church, where the Saints are being taught the Gospel and are keeping the commandments of God. 

We are happy to report to you that in their tithes and offerings they are keeping pace with the stakes of Zion. I echo the testimony of the truth of the Book of Mormon, as given by President Ivins and President Hardy, and say to you that out there in that mission nearly seventeen thousand copies of that sacred record have been distributed during the past year. We believe the Lord intended that this book should be read by the world, for he sent the Angel Moroni fifteen times to this planet to see that it was properly printed, that the world might be taught that Jesus is the Christ; and unless we, as a people, see to it that this sacred record is distributed among his confused children on the earth, they will not be sure that Jesus is the Christ. For they all read the selfsame Bible and are going in hundreds of different ways, evidencing their confusion. So I believe that the Book of Mormon is the means the Lord has given us as a new witness for God and that Jesus is the Christ. 

May we as a people rise to this great responsibility and carry forward our work. I bear testimony to you that it is the truth and pray God to bless us all in the name of Jesus. Amen.

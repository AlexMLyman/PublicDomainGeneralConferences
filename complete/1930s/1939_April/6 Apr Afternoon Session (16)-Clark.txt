I am sure that I can speak for all of you when I say to President Grant, who is listening in, that we have missed him, and that we join in prayers that he may be early restored to health and strength. 

I should like to thank, on behalf of the First Presidency, of this audience and of all who have listened in, the Singing Mothers for their excellent singing.

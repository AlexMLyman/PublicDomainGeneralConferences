The Nebo Stake Choir, which has furnished the music for this session of the Conference, is made up of the choirs of the various wards in the Nebo Stake. 

We thank you, brethren and sisters, for the excellent service you have rendered this inspiring Conference throughout the day. 

SERVICE OF PEACE OFFICERS COMMENDED 

You have undoubtedly noticed the care that the peace officers of our city are taking to direct automobile traffic and to protect pedestrians. The City Commission and the peace officers will appreciate our cooperation in their efforts to avoid accidents. In behalf of the Conference we wish to commend those officers who are in and around this block, who are rendering such excellent service for our comfort and safety.

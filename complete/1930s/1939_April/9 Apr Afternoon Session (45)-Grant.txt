I know we can stand a selection by the choir, and inasmuch as we are to have "The Hallelujah Chorus" from "The Messiah," by the choir, I am prolonging the meeting a little. I know that you will wait to hear this selection. 

REGARDING AGE 

I rejoice in the remarkable and splendid Conference we have had. It has been a source of sorrow to me to be absent part of the time. I am feeling fine, physically. Speaking of old age, Brother Charles W. Penrose lacked only a few weeks of being seventy-five when he came to Liverpool to preside over the European and British Missions, and he performed — at least the missionaries did during his administration — many more baptisms than did Francis M. Lyman and Heber J. Grant. Brother Penrose was there three years, and we had five years. So you must not think that age counts when it comes to spreading the Gospel. If they have the root of the matter in them and are healthy, just let them go out and work. 

BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TRUTH 

I thank the Lord for this remarkable and wonderful Conference we have had. No such conference could be held by any other people in all the wide world. Why is it that the Latter-day Saints have such a spirit with them? Why is it that every missionary who fulfills a good mission says it is the best time of his life? It is because we have the truth and they are nearer to the Lord when in the mission field than in any other place. 

May the blessings of the Lord be and abide with all of you. May you go home under the inspiration of the spirit that has been with us, first, last, and all time. 

I apologize to Brother Rulon S. Wells for not having him speak. Brother Wells, you know, is past eighty, and so am I. We had him speak to us in the temple, and then we asked him to speak again today, after the morning meeting, to the German Saints.

My beloved brethren and sisters: I presume it is owing to the fact that I am the son of President Brigham Young that I have this honor. 

I want to say that I believe if father were here he would rejoice very greatly in the proceedings that have taken place during the last few days. 

The foundation of our faith is that we believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. We have heard quoted some of the Savior's sayings, such as: "If you come unto me you shall have eternal life," and "If you come unto me and are baptized ye shall be saved." What is salvation, and what is eternal life? 

To be saved is this, that if we comply with the requirements set forth by our Savior, we will not have to suffer for our sins. That is one thing. Another thing is that if we accept the Gospel, become members of the Church of Jesus Christ and remain faithful to the end. when we die our spirits will go into paradise; that is, we will be placed beyond the power of evil. We will not have to suffer the temptations that we suffer here. 

We are promised if we become members of this Church and are faithful to the end that when the Savior comes again, we shall receive a resurrection, and that promise is not given to any others than those who accept the terms. 

Members of the Church who are faithful to the end will have life in the presence of God. If one has complied with the requirements of salvation in the terrestrial kingdom, he will have eternal life. If he complies with the requirements of salvation in the telestial kingdom he will have eternal life. If he complies with the requirements for exaltation in the celestial kingdom he will have eternal life and exaltation in that kingdom. 

May God help us to properly use the knowledge that has been revealed to us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

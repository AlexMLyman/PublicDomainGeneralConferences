The first organization of our women in the United States was the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Today we have nearly one hundred thousand members in that organization. A marvelous work and a wonder has been accomplished by them. 

We have a Mutual Improvement Association for the young ladies, which organization is now more than fifty years old, and has a membership of more than fifty thousand at the present time. 

We have a Primary Association that has been established for more than fifty years and that now has practically a hundred thousand members. 

INSUFFICIENT TIME 

I regret exceedingly that we have never had a conference — and I suppose we never will have — in which we are not limited for time as it draws near to the close. We make our calculations in our Mutual conferences, in our great Sunday School meetings, and the conferences of our other organizations, with the expectation that we can get through on time and be able to hear from all to whom we would like to listen. But almost without exception, towards the close of our meetings we are short of time. 

SISTERS TO SPEAK BRIEFLY 

I had hoped to give to our good sisters, the presidents of the Relief Society, the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and the Primary Organization, at least ten minutes each in which to speak to us at this conference. But we will have to ask them to be content with the same amount of time that we have given to the mission presidents, namely, seven and one-half minutes each. 

We shall call upon Sister Robison of the Relief Society to be the first of these sisters to address us.

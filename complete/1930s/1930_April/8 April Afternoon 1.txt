We never seem to have all the time that we would like to have at our conferences. Therefore, we have arranged for two extra sessions tomorrow, and we do most sincerely hope that the people will fill this building at our closing sessions. We have in the past had to draw our inspiration partly from empty benches on the last day of our conference when that has fallen on a week day. We hope that on this centennial occasion this will not be the case. 

We dislike very much to limit the time of our speakers, but we had a message from one of the senior apostles which took me only seven and one-half minutes to read; so we are going to call on some of our brethren to speak to us and ask them to be satisfied with the same length of time that Brother Smoot had. 

Our first speaker will be Elder Samuel O. Bennion, President of the Central States Mission, who has been laboring in that mission for more than twenty years as its president.

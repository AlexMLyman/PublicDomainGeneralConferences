A young man who claims to have counted the audience at our meetings from day to day announces that there are 8,029 people here this afternoon, and that there have been in this building during the conference sessions 50,562 people. I hope he is correct. 

I should be very pleased if I had the time to make some remarks, but by the time the choir has sung an anthem and the closing prayer has been offered the radio will be disconnected, and it would not be fair to the people who are listening to the radio broadcast for me to try to say anything and they not hear it. I offer my apologies to the leading brethren who are here who expected to speak but did not have an opportunity to do so. 

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS OF CONFERENCE 

I earnestly and sincerely express my gratitude to the Lord for this conference. Like all the conferences that I have attended during the past fifty-two years, it is the best we have ever had. I have heard that expression regarding all the general conferences of the Church; and the only way that I can account for it is that we are hungry, and the same bread and butter tastes a little better when we have an appetite than it does otherwise although it is the same material. We have indeed been blessed of the Lord, and I am grateful for his blessing. 

I am thankful beyond my ability to express myself for the opportunity we had last Sunday morning at 12:30 to broadcast a message to the people of the world. 

DELIGHTED WITH THE SINGING AT CONFERENCE 

I wish to endorse all that has been said in regard to the singing to which we have listened during this conference. We were charmed and delighted with the singing by the choir from Manti, and by the Singing Mothers, as also by the Tabernacle Choir.

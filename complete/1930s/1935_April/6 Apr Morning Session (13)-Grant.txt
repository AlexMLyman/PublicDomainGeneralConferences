Y. M. M. I. A. BOARD REORGANIZED 

I overlooked announcing that some weeks ago the General Superintendency and members of the board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association were honorably released by the Presidency of the Church, and a letter was written to the board requesting that they continue to function until after this conference, when the new superintendency and board would be sustained. 

In retiring they do so with the love, confidence, blessing, good will, and deep gratitude of the First Presidency and members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. All of you who feel to sustain the release of these men and to give to them our love and blessing in their retiring, will manifest it by raising the right hand. 

(The vote was then taken.) 

I can announce, as I have always done in the past, that the voting has been unanimous.

I have been delighted, my brethren and sisters, as I know you have, with the splendid things of this conference. My heart has been touched with the testimonies given us by the General Authorities. I have been given new courage to go on in the tasks assigned to me in this great work, as I know you have. The thing that I think has touched me most in this conference is the statement that was read in the first session by President McKay relating to the growth and development of the Church. That statement reminded me of the words of one of the Book of Mormon prophets to the effect that man is that he might have joy. 

My heart rejoices that more people are coming into this great Church, that their lives may be made better and happier, because in the Gospel of Jesus Christ there is happiness, there is joy â€” that joy which we can obtain through no other labor. I rejoice in the growth and advancement of the Church. 

I am grateful beyond expression, my brethren and sisters, that I have been called into the service, if I may make that statement. I have been in the service a great many years, but for a year or more not in direct activity. I am so grateful that my brethren of the General Authorities found me worthy to go into the world to preach the Gospel, the message of savlation and of life. I cannot tell you how grateful I am for this confidence and I feel that no greater blessing can come to anyone. 

God bless us that we may be faithful in this great work and valiant in carrying forward the banner of truth, that his blessings may guide and direct us in all our endeavors to further his work, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

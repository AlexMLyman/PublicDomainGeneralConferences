The work of training prospective missionaries — How the Elders are called— Appeal for personal purity. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I have listened today with joy and satisfaction to the remarks of my brethren, and with you I rejoice in the testimony they have given and the pleasant influence that has prompted them, and that especially rested upon President Smith in his introductory remarks this forenoon. 

As has been remarked by my brethren of the Seventies, many missionaries are being called and sent into the field. We have at the present time between 1,300 and 1,400 young men scattered throughout about twenty missionary fields. While there are less at the present time than we have had in times past, we believe that as a rule the Elders are better equipped now than formrly; for they have better opportunities to school themselves and to gain the information that will qualify them to meet the vicissitudes and the obligations that missionaries have to face in the midst of an unbelieving world. Looking to this better equipment, the Presidency of the Church have established missionary classes in most of the leading institutions of learning in the various Stakes of Zion. In Arizona there is a Latter-day Saints academy in the St. Joseph Stake, which Stake is presided over by Prest. Andrew Kimball, and it seems to have been his ambiton and determination to make that institution, with the aid of his brethren and the Latter-day Saints of that Stake, an institution where the young people can be educated and advanced along the lines of proper education, thus fitting and preparing them for missionary labor and for the duties that will devolve upon them as they grow to riper years. In the Brigham Young Academy at Provo is established another missionary class; also one in the Snow academy, of South Sanpete Stake, and another large class in the Latter-day Saints University of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, and still another in the Weber Stake Academy and in the Brigham Young College at Logan. In these missionary classes the young men are taught the principles of the Gospel. They are also taught good manners. They are introduced to a system of study, and required to prosecute it, along particular lines, so as to prepare them for the duties of missionaries, and fit them to meet the people of the world in a proper manner and spirit. It is enjoined upon these missionaries, when they go out into the world, that they not only bring to bear the power that they may gain by having a knowledge of the Gospel and a witness of the Holy Spirit in regard to its truth, but that they shall approach people in a proper, gentlemanly manner, and never be guilty of tearing down or pulling to pieces other people's religious faith. They are shown how to make friends with strangers, and how to induce people to receive them kindly, by creating a friendly feeling in the hearts of those whom they approach. About thirteen weeks ago it was proposed in this stake of Zion that there should be a night school for missionaries established. President Paul, of the Latter-day Saints University, had an interview with the Presidency of the Church, and they assigned the management of this class to the Council of the Seventies. Immediately the class was organized, and teachers were chosen to give this night class instruction. Brother Ben Goddard was chosen as instructor for the first six weeks; Bishop Iverson of the Second ward was chosen for the next six weeks; and those two brethren are just closing their labors with this night class. I wish to say in their behalf that they have manfully, earnestly and profitably conducted this class; they have been devoted, and they have done a good work among the youth of this stake of Zion. They are worthy of great praise and commendation for the devotion they have exhibited in this work. Brother J. M. Tanner, superintendent of Church schools, and a professor of marked ability in the education of the youth of Zion, is going to take charge of the class for the next six weeks. We see already good results from the training of these brethren. 

In regard to the young Elders that have recently gone out on missions, I want to say that they, like other Elders who have been called and sent into the missionary field, have been called by the voice of the Lord through the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While I state this I agree with my brethren that in the future possibly some brethren of greater experience might be added to this corps of young men that are being constantly sent out. On the first of the month we set apart 26 young Elders: on the second, four more, and yesterday, 18 more, making 48 young missionaries that have already been ordained and set apart and are ready to start. Some of them have already gone, while the rest are ready to go into the different parts of the world. These are mostly young men, some of them quite boyish in their appearance; and yet they have come here at the call of the Presidency of the Church and offered a sacrifice, to devote their time, their lives, and all that they have, to the service of the Master, at the call of their leader. When we look upon these young men we feel to bless them. As the presiding quorum of Seventy have considerable of this labor to do, we rejoice exceedingly when we see the willingness with which these young men respond to the calls made upon them; and we contemplate with a great deal of satisfaction the advance that they have made in the past few months during which they have been students in these missionary classes, thus fitting and preparing themselves for usefulness and beginning the labor of their lives; for this is only the beginning. As we have been informed by our presiding officers, other missions will be opened, and more numerous will the calls be. Therefore, the Seventies need to prepare themselves for this great labor, by earnest and faithful study of the principles of the Gospel; and when the call comes to them, let the feeling be universal in the quorums of Seventies that there is no chance to shirk, no loophole for them to get out, and that they must respond to the call; for when a man is ordained a Seventy he becomes a "minute man," and the Lord and His servants expect that he will be ever ready, for that is what the term means. 

I saw a notice not long ago that Harvard university was calling from its advanced classes for volunteers to go to foreign lands to preach the Gospel — to be soldiers of the cross and follow the Divine Master. It was stated that some had answered that they were ready to go to any part of the world, but not any very great number. Then I asked myself the question, How are they going? Are they going out as Elders, or Priests, or Seventies, or High Priests? What kind of a calling do they get, and who calls them? I am not going to pass any opinion upon them, nor upon the call that they received; but I have learned of the Gospel this much, that for a man to he called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands and to be authorized to go forth to preach the Gospel, he must be ordained and set apart under the hands of an Apostle or by his direction. This is the way that the missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are sent out. This is the way the servants of God have always been sent out, in every age of the world. The missionaries that preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ are always sent out under a divine call, by direction of the Apostles, with the Lord Jesus himself at the head. 

Recently I read part of a column in the Deseret News from which paper I gain much valuable information in regard to things that are transpiring in the world; and of interest to the people of this Church. I noticed that a Prof. Hite had made a great discovery pertaining to the cliff dwellers along the Colorado river. In speaking of one cliff dwelling he stated that he had traced it along the surface of the cliff down near the bank of the river, and had measured the distance as accurately as he could, and that one dwelling, he said, was more than a quarter of a mile in length and four stories in height, and the lower story was 600 feet up a perpendicular cliff, out of reach, and the rocks projecting as they did some 100 feet out from the cliff overhanging the dwelling prevented anyone from being let down from the rock above to reach it. This learned professor gave it as his opinion that this structure must have been erected more than 12,000,000 of years ago, because the erosion of that rock could not have been accomplished in less time than that. I want to call your attention to III Nephi in the Book of Mormon. We find there that great upheavals took place on this continent during the crucifixion of the Savior. Many cities were destroyed, and great inland seas were formed; great fissures and caverns were made through solid rocks, and lakes and rivers drained. By reading an account of this great upheaval we may readily conclude that it has not taken 12,000,000 of years to change the face of nature since these cliff dwellings were erected. The Prophet Joseph, through the inspiration of the Almighty, brought to light the Book of Mormon. By the same power he introduced the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and instituted the organization of the quorums of the Holy Priesthood in the perfect form that we see them today. 

These young Elders go out with a testimony in their hearts that in the latter days the Lord has raised up a Prophet, who has brought life and light and immortality to the children of men. They have received a knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, and that by Him and through Him mankind may be redeemed, through faith and obedience to the Gospel. The resurrection of the dead is brought to light through the resurrection of our Redeemer, and Jesus lived and died for the salvation of the human family. These young Elders have this testimony, which they go out to proclaim, after being ordained and set apart Under the inspiration of divine authority, through the Apostles of the Lord Jesus. Those who volunteer to go in response to the call made upon them, go forth fearlessly, trusting in the power that called them; relying not on their own strength, but on the strength of the power of God. We say to these young Elders, "When you go into a house where they give you entertainment, conduct yourselves as gentlemen; be clean and pure in your department and in your conversation; hold the honor of that house and that family as sacred, yea, more sacred than you do your own life, and do not permit anything to be said or done by you that shall bring suspicion upon you or shall tarnish your good name. You go out to represent a good people, who are virtuous, honest, and upright before the Lord. Do not let your actions tarnish that good name. Do not do anything that shall prevent you, when you return, from receiving the embrace of that loving mother that Brother Kimball mentioned this morning; but be in that condition that when you look your loved ones in the face you can do so without your cheeks burning with shame, or without your eyes quailing through a consciousness of misconduct." 

This is some of the instruction that the Elders receive prior to their departure for missionary fields. We want to say to our young men who are still students in these missionary classes, and to all our young men and maidens throughout Israel, Be ye pure and clean; observe the laws of perfect chastity in all your associations, knowing and realizing that the eye of the Almighty Father is upon you, and that your parents and the pioneers of this great work expect from you that you will conduct yourselves in a way that shall bring credit to this people, not only while you are abroad, but when you are at home also. Let your conduct be all that it should be, and do not infringe upon the rights of your fellow men. Let your lives be garnished with purity of thought and action. The Jewish maidens were taught by their mothers, many generations before the coming of the Messiah, to be pure and clean and to keep their persons from everything that would bring a taint or a blemish upon them, for the reason that their Messiah, the king of Judah, was coming to reign upon the earth, and He would come through the loins of a Jewish maiden. Hence the Jewish mothers impressed upon their daughters the necessity of keeping themselves virtuous and sweet, so that they might be worthy of the honor of bringing forth the Messiah. Such was the lasting impression made upon the Jewish maidens by these teachings that the same purity of thought and action characterizes them even to this day. The Messiah came through a beautiful Jewish maiden, but they did not receive Him; and many of them still look forward to His coming. As you were informed today, many of the Jews now look upon the Savior as a great and good teacher, and one worthy of the esteem and fellowship of the Jews; and in this connection I am reminded of a little circumstance that was called to my mind in witnessing a play called "The Wife." In one scene there was a meeting of the directors of a bank at midnight. Their cashier had been embezzling the funds of the bank, and his wife came in to plead for mercy for him. She found, however, that she could not touch the hearts of the bankers. The president of the bank was a Jew, and she, seeing a picture of the Messiah on the wall of his study where they were assembled said, in the name of that holy being whom you worship, I ask for mercy." He said, "Madam, I do not worship that being." "Why, then, said she, do you have His picture in your house. Because, he replied, he was a Jew, and the greatest Jew that ever lived, and why should I not have his picture in my house? This evidences the very thing that Brother Roberts said, that the Jews are learning to look upon Jesus, whom we worship, as the greatest of the Jews, as a great teacher, and are honoring Him as such. The time has not yet come for them to acknowledge Him as the Messiah of their nation, but it will come; and He will come, for He has promised that He will come and reign upon the earth with His people. It is the duty of His people, therefore, to prepare for His second coming, that they may be found ready to receive Him, and not be like the unbelieving Judean nation — refuse to recognize Him when He does come; for it is by the faith of the Gospel and the witness that we have in our hearts that we know that He is the Savior of the world, and that He is coming to reign on earth with His people. May the Lord bless you, and fit and prepare you for His coming, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I hope that the congregation will be patient just a few moments more. We have a little matter of business to bring before the conference by way of a notice for action in the future, probably at the next October conference. The Latter-day Saints generally are familiar with the book called the Pearl of Great Price. The old edition of it has been accepted by the Church as an authentic doctrinal work. It has now been re-published, with some improvements. It has been divided into chapters and verses, with references on the bottom of the pages. This has been done, under the sanction of the Presidency of the Church, by Elder James E. Talmage. We have eliminated from the Pearl of Great Price those revelations it formerly contained which are to be found, and always were, in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, believing that it was unnecessary to publish revelations in the Pearl of Great Price that were included in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. These changes have been made in the book, and it is now ready for the use of those who desire to obtain it; and at the coming October conference the book will be presented to the conference for their acceptance in its revised and changed form.

president of the Eastern States mission, said: I take great pleasure in assembling with you in this conference and I am enjoying a spiritual feast, in listening to the counsels that come to us from God through His Holy servants. The uppermost thought in my mind is that God has indited the counsels that have been given to us in our meetings thus far. I have been away from the body of the Church for two years, as a missionary to the Eastern States. While I have been absent when conference time has rolled around my spirit has been here and I have longed to sit under the sanctuary and receive the word of God as it is given from time to time by His servants. I desire to bear my testimony to you, my co-laborers, that God has inspired His Prophet in this day with regard to the law of tithing, and that this spirit is not only in Zion but that it has spread abroad into every part of the world where the Saints and Elders are living. A little less than a year ago, after the word of the Lord had come through our Prophet with regard to this law of tithing, we caught up the spirit of it in the Eastern States mission. It electrified us. It was nothing but the power of God that did it. The spirit bore witness to us that that word was from God and that it was not of man. I do not feel that I have power to take up your valuable time this morning, but I did want to bear this testimony unto you, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I want to say just a few words. What I say may not be necessary to a large portion of this audience, but I want the Latter-day Saints to understand and think of the object of their coming together. It is only once in six months that we have such an opportunity as we have today, and I wish to remind the Latter-day Saints that the advantages we receive today or tomorrow, while gathered here, will be according to the spirit that we exercise individually. The Elders may address you here, and yet no particular advantage is secured unless you have the spirit and exercise the faith that it is our privilege to exercise, that we may be blessed to understand such things as may be spoken. We had a beautiful meeting yesterday, and the Spirit of the Lord was poured out greatly upon the Elders who spoke. We wish the same today, and we would like the Latter-day Saints to forget everything outside of the meeting, and try to exercise faith that the speakers may advance such principles as will be most to our service.

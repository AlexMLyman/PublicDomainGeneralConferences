"I hold in my hand a copy of the revised edition of the Pearl of Great Price. The Pearl of Great Price, as it originally existed, was presented before the general conference and accepted as one of the standard works of the Church. Since then the book has undergone a revision; that is to say, all the revelations that it formerly contained which were also in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, have been eliminated from it, as we thought it unnecessary to have revelations published in this book which were already published in the Doctrine and Covenants; therefore, these revelations have been eliminated from the Pearl of Great Price as it now is, and you will find them In the Doctrine and Covenants. In addition to this, Professor James E. Talmage has gone through the work and divided it into chapters and verses, making it a far more convenient book of reference than it was before. He has also supplied copious footnotes or references, which will be an aid in the study of the book. 

These are the changes that have been made in the book, and we now present this book in its revised form — the original matter being preserved as it was before, only divided into chapters and verses — for your acceptance as a standard work of the Church." 

It was moved and seconded that the book be accepted as a standard work of the Church, and the motion was carried unanimously. 

President Smith then presented the authorities of the Church, first remarking that "we desire that the brethren and sisters will all feel the responsibility of expressing their feelings in relation to the propositions that may be put before you. We do not want any man or woman who is a member of the Church to violate their conscience. Of course, we are not asking apostates or non-members of the Church to vote on the authorities of the Church. We only ask for members of the Church in good standing to vote on the propositions that shall be put before you, and we would like all to vote as they feel, whether for or against."

Empey was sustained as general supervisor of the Relief Society nurses, with Sister Phebe Y. Beatie as secretary and treasurer, and Sister Margaret C. Roberts as instructor. 

It is desired that the Relief Society of every stake of Zion shall send as many young women as possible to study nursing, and that the presidents of stakes shall interest themselves with the Relief Societies and young ladies that the good work that has been started here may be carried on, and that the sick and needy throughout all the settlements may have proper attention.

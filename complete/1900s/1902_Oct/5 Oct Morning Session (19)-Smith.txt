I would like to remark that Brother Kelsch was honorably released from his mission in Japan. It has been discovered that it will take very young men, and take them some years, too, possibly, to master the Japanese language. Brother Kelsch has been serving in the missionary field for the last five or six years, without any respite at all, and it was thought that he was a man too far advanced in years and had been serving too long in the missionary field to keep him in the Japanese mission until he could learn that language. Therefore, he was honorably released.

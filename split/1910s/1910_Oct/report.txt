merous testimonies, additional to other 
Christians, concerning the Messiah. — 
Strong personal testimony of the di- 
vinity of Joseph Smith's appointment 
to restore the Gospel and reveal doc- 
trines of salvation. 

I feel very grateful for the priv- 
ilege of being present with you this 
morning, at the opening of our 
eighty-first anniversary of the semi- 
annual conference of the Church. I 
am pleased to see so many present, 
and my heart is full of blessing for 
the Latter-day Saints and, indeed, 
for all the honest in heart through- 
out the world. I earnestly desire 
that the Spirit of the Lord may vis- 
it us and abide with us throughout 
all the sessions of this conference, 
that those who administer and those 
who are administered unto may re- 
joice exceedingly in the presence of 
the Holy Spirit upon them and in 
their hearts, inspiring them to dili- 
gence and faithfulness in the great 
work of God in which we are en- 
gaged. 

I do not feel that I should occupy 
very much time this morning. I 
have just got out of my bed, where 
I have lain for more than a month, 
with very little exercise, and I feel 
the effects of the inertia, the inac- 
tivity to which I have been subject- 
ed — not willingly but unwillingly — 
for the last thirty days or more. 
Nevertheless, I feel in my heart to 
say to this congregation that I love 
the gospel, I love the truth that has 
been revealed anew to the children 
of men in these latter days, more, 
if possible, today than ever I did in 
my life. I believe in it just as truly 
and as firmly today as I ever did, 
and, if possible, more so ; and I 
think it is possible, for the reason 
that I believe all true Latter-day 
Saints are growing. They are pro- 
gressing, they are absorbing more 
light, more intelligence, stronger 



convictions of the truth, day by day ; 
for we cannot help doing this, if we 
enjoy the spirit of the gospel as we 
should. 

I feel happy, this morning, in 
having the privilege to say to you 
that in the days of my childhood and 
early youth, I made a pledge with 
God and with His people that I 
would be true to them. In looking 
over the experiences of my life, I 
cannot now discern and do not re- 
member a circumstance, since the 
beginning of my experience in the 
world, where I have felt, for a mo- 
ment, to slacken or relax in the 
pledge and promise that I made to 
God and to the Latter-day Saints, 
or to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in my youth. And 
if there is a man, or a woman, in 
the world that can point out to me 
an instance, in all my life, where I 
have been untrue to my pledge, or 
promise, or covenant, I shall be glad 
to receive that information from 
that man or woman. As an elder in 
Israel I tried to be true to that call- 
ing; I tried to my utmost to honor 
and magnify that calling. When I 
became a seventy, I felt in my heart 
to be true to that calling, and I 
strove, with all the intelligence and 
fervor of my soul, to be true to it. 
I have no knowledge nor recollec- 
tion of any act of mine, or any cir- 
cumstance in my life where I proved 
untrue or unfaithful to these callings 
in the priesthood of the Son of God. 
Later in my life, when I was called 
to act as an apostle, and was or- 
dained an apostle, and set apart to 
be one of the Twelve, I strove to 
honor that calling, to be true to it. 
and to my brethren, to the house- 
hold of faith, and to the covenants 
and obligations involved in receiv- 
ing this holy priesthood which is 
after the order of the Son of God. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



I am not aware that I ever violated 
one of my obligations or pledges in 
these callings to which I have been 
called. I have sought to be true 
and faithful to all these things. I 
have endeavored to be true to my 
family ; and if, ever, I have violated 
one pledge or promise, or neglected 
one obligation that rests upon me 
in these relationships, I do not know 
it. And when I have made pledges 
to the people of God, or to the 
world, if ever I have violated those 
pledges I do not know it. Further- 
more, I do not believe there is a man 
living that does know it, or that can 
truthfully testify that I ever did vio- 
late those pledges. 

I stand before you today, my 
brethren, sisters and friends, on the 
ground that I have tried to be true 
to God, to the utmost of my knowl- 
edge and ability ; that I have tried to 
be true to my people, to the utmost 
of my knowledge and ability ; and 
I have been true to the world in 
every pledge and promise that I 
have made to the world, notwith- 
standing there have been men who 
have shown a disposition to make it 
appear that I was a hypocrite, that 
I was two-faced : that I was one 
thing to the world and another thing 
in secret. I want it distinctly un- 
derstood that those who have con- 
veyed such an idea as this to man- 
kind have been wilfully injuring me, 
wronging me, and falsifying me and 
my character before the people : and 
I want it distinctly understood those 
things must stop. They must stop 
at least among men that profess to 
be members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints; I can 
endure to be maligned and perse- 
cuted by my enemies, who are also 
enemies of the Kingdom of God, but 
I do not want to be maligned and 
belied by men who profess to be 



members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, neither 
intentionally or otherwise. Now, I 
trust that you understand clearly 
what I mean. I do not know how 
I can make it much plainer or clear- 
er, with the knowledge that I have 
of language. Then, I repeat, as 
the Lord has helped me in the past 
to be true to my covenants, that I 
have entered into with Him and 
with you, with my brethren and 
with the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, so by His help 
and by His blessing I propose to be 
true throughout the future, of my 
life, whether I am permitted to live 
long or short ; it matters not to me. 
While I live, I hope to be a true 
man, an honest man, a man who can 
face all mankind and, at last, who 
can stand before God, the Judge of 
the quick and the dead, and not 
quail for what I have done in the 
world. 

May God bless you. May peace 
abide with you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. I pray you to be true to your 
covenants ; be true to those cove- 
nants that you made in the waters 
of baptism, to those covenants you 
made in the house of the Lord, and 
true to every righteous obligation 
that devolves upon you. To be Lat- 
ter-day Saints, men or women must 
be thinkers, and workers ; they must 
be men and women who weigh mat- 
ters in their minds, men and women 
who consider carefully their course 
of life and the principles that they 
have espoused. Men cannot be faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints unless they 
study and understand, to some ex- 
tent at least, the principles of the 
gospel that they have received. 
When you hear of people, that pro- 
fess to be Latter-day Saints, run- 
ning off on tangents, on foolish no- 
tions and one-horse, cranky ideas,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



things that are obviously opposed 
to reason, and to good sense, op- 
posed to principles of righteousness 
and to the word of the Lord, that 
has been revealed to men, you 
should know at once that they have 
not studied the principles of the gos- 
pel, and do not know very much 
about the gospel. When people un- 
derstand the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
you will see them walking straight- 
forward, according to the word of 
the Lord, and the law of God, strict- 
ly in accordance with that which is 
consistent, just, righteous, and in 
every sense acceptable to the Lord, 
who only accepts of that which is 
right and pleasing in His sight ; for 
only that which is right is pleasing 
unto Him. 

I have not time, neither have I 
strength, this morning, to enter in- 
to details or to undertake to preach 
a lengthy discourse. I do not feel 
able to do it, physically. The spirit 
is willing, but just now the flesh is 
not very strong ; but I want to bear 
mjy testimony to you Latter-day 
Saints. I know that my Redeemer 
lives. We have all the testimony 
and all the evidence of this great 
and glorious truth, that the world 
has, that is, all that the so-called 
Christian world possesses ; and, in 
addition to all that they have, we 
have the testimony of the inhabi- 
tants of this western continent, to 
whom the Savior appeared, and de- 
livered His gospel, the same as He 
delivered it to the Jews. In addi- 
tion to all this new testimony and 
the testimony of the holy scriptures 
from the Jews, we have the testi- 
mony of the modern Prophet, Jo- 
seph Smith, who saw the Father and 
the Son, and who has borne record 
of them to the world ; whose testi- 
mony was sealed with his blood, 
and is in force upon the world to- 



day. We have the testimony of 
others who witnessed the presence 
of the Son of God, in the Kirtland 
temple, when He appeared to them 
there, and the testimony of Joseph 
and Sidney Rigdon, who declared 
that they were the last witnesses 
of Jesus Christ. Therefore, I say 
again, I know that my Redeemer 
lives ; for in the mouths of these 
witnesses this truth has been estab- 
lished in my mind. 

Beside these testimonies, 1 have 
received the witness of the Spirit of 
God in my own heart, which ex- 
ceeds all other evidences, for it 
bears record to me, to my very soul, 
of the existence of my Redeemer, 
Jesus Christ. I know that He lives, 
and that in the last day He shall 
stand upon the earth, and that He 
shall come to the people who shall 
be prepared for Him, as a bride is 
prepared for the bridegroom, when 
He shall come. I believe in the di- 
vine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and I have every evidence 
that I need — at least enough to con- 
vince me of the divinity of his mis- 
sion. 

I am proud to say that I have ac- 
cepted and have tried to keep and 
honor every word that has proceed- 
ed from the mouth of God through 
him. As — "It is written, man shall 
not live by bread alone, but by every 
word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God." No one will dare 
to accuse me of side-tracking from, 
or of refusing to obey any doctrine 
taught by or revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I bear my testimony to you and 
to the world, that Joseph Smith was 
raised up by the power of God to 
lay the foundations of this great 
Latter-day work, to reveal the ful- 
ness of the gospel to the world in 
this dispensation, to restore the

priesthood of God to the world, by 
which men may act in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Ghost, and it will be ac- 
cepted of God ; it will be by His 
authority. I bear my testimony to 
it ; I know that it is true. 

I bear my testimony to the divine 
authority of those who have suc- 
ceeded the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in the presidency of this Church. 
They were men of God. I knew 
them; I was intimately associated 
with them; and as one man may 
know another, through the intimate 
knowledge that he possesses of him, 
so I can bear testimony to the in- 
tegrity, to the honor, to the purity 
of life, to the intelligence, and to 
the divinity of the mission and call- 
ing of Brigham, of John, of Wil- 
ford, and of Lorenzo. They were 
inspired of God to fill the mission 
to which they were called, and I 
know it. I thank God for that testi- 
mony and for the spirit that prompts 
me and impels me towards these 
men, toward their mission, toward 
this people, toward my God and my 
Redeemer. I thank the Lord for it, 
and I pray eanestly that it may nev- 
er depart from me — worlds with- 
out end. 

God bless you, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A contralto solo, "Fear Not," 
was sung by Sister Mabel Cooper. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON" H. LUND. 

The way to regain our Heavenly 
Father's presence has been made 
known. — Interest in Temple work 
greatly increased. — Recent persecution 
of missionaries in Germany seems to 
have resulted beneficially. — Gratifying 
progress in all the European countries, 
in spite of obstacles. — Children should 
be taught practical religon. — Attend- 



ance at Sacrament meetings an im- 
portant duty. 

I am very happy, this morning, 
to be present at this conference and 
to see so many of the saints who 
have assembled here at this first 
meeting. I rejoice that we have had 
the pleasure of listening to our pres- 
ident, that his health has permitted 
him to leave his room and to come 
here and bear such a powerful testi- 
mony unto us. I know that you, 
with me, are happy to see him and 
to listen to him, and our prayers 
are that President Smith may re- 
gain his wonted health, and be re- 
leased from all pain of the kind he 
has suffered so long. 

I was pleased to listen to the 
beautiful song that has just been 
rendered, and my thoughts were 
drawn to that happy period concern- 
ing which our sister sang, the time 
when sorrow and crying shall not be 
found, and death be no more ; and 
then to be in the presence of our 
heavenly Father. What a beautiful 
hope we have ; and we have learned 
the way to realize it. Jesus is the 
way ; He taught us how to regain 
our Father's presence ; He atoned 
for our sins and made us one with 
the Father again. Now, if we de- 
sire to have a share in that happy 
condition of which our sister sang, 
we must follow the example He has 
given us. We must study the way 
■and walk therein ; we must study 
our duties and perform them, and 
not shrink from them, nor neglect 
them. 

I believe that during the last six 
months there has been great pro- 
gress in the Church, and that the 
saints are drawing nearer unto God, 
and are trying to perform their 
duties better than before. When I 
look upon the eagerness with which 
the saints flock to the temples, I 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



know that in spiritual matters they 
feel well. During the last year, the 
temple here has been crowded, and 
I congratulate the saints upon this 
fact, which shows that they love to 
go into the house of God and take 
part in the ordinances which are 
performed therein. The prophecy 
of Malachi is fulfilling; the hearts 
of the children are turned to their 
fathers. During the last six months 
we have had a great increase in the 
number of the members of the Gen- 
ealogical Society, which proves the 
interest that the saints are taking in 
the great work for the dead. Many 
are sending abroad, obtaining their 
records to quite an extent, and I 
want to encourage the saints in this 
good work. 

Yesterday we had seventy-two 
couples of young people come into 
the temple to be married. That is 
a good sign. We want the young 
people to begin married life aright. 
We want them to go to the house of 
God and make covenants with Him 
to serve Him, and also enter into 
covenants with one another in re- 
gard to married life, and to obtain 
the blessings of the sealings per- 
formed under the authority of the 
holy priesthood. 

The work abroad continues to 
prosper. We have the joy to learn 
that the work in Europe is going 
forward in spite of all opposition. 
About three months ago, we heard 
about a wholesale exiling of our 
elders from Prussia. I believe there 
were twenty-one cast into prison, 
and it looked as if that government 
would succeed in its determination 
to stop the progress of the work of 
the Lord in that kingdom. Our 
elders, however, did not feel dis- 
heartened. If they could not labor 
in Prussia, there were other coun- 
tries where they could go and la- 



bor in the Lord's vineyard. We 
have had letters from prominent 
men in Germany and in France, 
asking us for literature. They want- 
ed to know more about us and gave 
as a reason, that they had read 
about the persecution of the elders 
by the government of Prussia. They 
say they could hardly believe that 
such things could take place in the 
twentieth century. The report of 
the German mission shows that the 
work there has not been stopped, for 
the month after this occurrence was, 
I believe, one of the banner months 
in that mission, as to baptisms. 

In a late letter from President 
McKay, we learn that the branch 
established at Vienna last year, with 
three members, has now grown to 
thirty-five ; and at a meeting he at- 
tended there were a hundred people 
present and this was only a meeting 
by invitation. He thinks that there 
is one of the best openings for the 
proclamation of the gospel. Like- 
wise in Hungary. Our elders have 
not done much in that kingdom. It 
belongs to Austria, but is a separ- 
ate nationality. We have a brother 
there who has studied the language, 
and has published tracts in it, and a 
considerable awakening is witnessed 
there. People are eager to know 
something concerning the gospel of 
Christ, as revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph, and there are good pros- 
pects that many in that nation will 
come and join us. The brethren are 
continuing their labors in the 
French part of Switzerland, in 
France, and in Belgium, and are 
meeting success. Likewise in Hol- 
land in the Netherlands mission as 
a whole, our missionaries are ob- 
taining gratifying results. In Nor- 
way there, was some excitement, this 
summer, among the people. The 
priests and the press sought to have

laws passed against the elders be- 
ing allowed to preach in Norway,, 
and it looked for a while as if such 
laws would be passed. But, I am 
happy to say that the committee 
having the bill in hand reported to 
the Storthing or Congress of Nor- 
way, that there was no need of any 
more legislation in that regard. So 
our saints there feel to breathe 
freer. 

Whatever men may do, I feel 
that nothing can be done to stop 
the progress of the work of the 
Lord. This is the gospel, restored 
unto the earth, and it must be 
preached to all nations. John, in 
describing the mission of the angel, 
that should come with the everlast- 
ing gospel, tells us that his procla- 
mation was to go to all nations. 
None should be exempt ; none had 
the gospel ; it had to be restored 
and preached to all ; and this has 
become our mission, brethren and 
sisters ; we must do this work. We 
are sending two thousand elders 
abroad. They are working dili- 
gently, and they are gaining the love 
and confidence of those with whom 
they become acquainted. The peo- 
ple look upon these men, as men 
who are what they profess to be — 
earnest ministers of the gospel, who 
seek to enlighten their fellow-men 
concerning their belief ; and in their 
works and. in their lives they show 
the fruits of the faith which God 
has given them. We are sending 
out missionaries every year, in fact, 
every month. 

I want to say to the saints, that 
our children should be taught in 
the principles of the gospel ; they 
should be encouraged to attend the 
different organizations that have 
been established for the develop- 
ment of our children and our young 
people. We have several of these 



organizations. Our Mutuals are 
doing a splendid work. We like to 
encourage those who are angaged 
therein, and encourage our fathers 
and mothers to see to it that their 
sons and their daughters take the 
courses that are given in the Mu- 
tuals. We also want to encourage 
them to send their children to the 
Primaries, to the Sunday Schools, 
and to the Religion Classes. We 
know that this is necessary. 

Our children should be guarded 
against contaminating influences. 
When we read reports from the Ju- 
venile courts, we feel shocked, and 
we are thankful that these courts 
have been established, for we be- 
lieve they do a great deal of good. 
We hope that our legislature will 
sustain them ; and we must take a 
hand with them. We must be 
warned by what we hear is going 
on among the young people, and try 
to protect them against the evil in- 
fluences that are so demoralizing. 
Let us encourage our children to be- 
come members of the organizations 
I have mentioned and to receive as 
much training as possible in relig- 
ion. We do not mean therebv that 
they should be taught theory entire- 
ly, but we want them taught prac- 
tical religion. We want them taught 
how to pray, how to walk upright- 
ly before God, how to learn to ex- 
ercise charity to the neighbor, to do 
good to those who are in need, -pnd 
tc remember the sick. I was 
touched when I heard that a certain 
c!a?s in the Religion Class organiza 
tion went and got flowers and sent 
them to a sick classmate to comfort 
him in his sickness, and thus gave 
evidence to the sick boy that he was 
remembered by his class. We 
should commend such things ; we 
want to encourage our children to 
think of others besides themselves.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Now, brethren and sisters, do not 
discourage the children from at- 
tending the Primaries, the Religion 
classes, or the Mutuals. All of 
these organizations are of the ut- 
most importanme, and we desire to 
see them well attended, so that the 
young people may get the benefit of 
the teachings given therein. 

We hope that the saints will be 
alive in their duties to attend their 
meetings. We find there is a slack- 
ness, in some places, and this I be- 
lieve, to some extent, can be as- 
cribed to those who have charge. 
The bishops and their assistants 
must study their congregations, and 
must seek to make their meetings 
interesting, so that they do not have 
to preach to empty benches. This 
has not been the custom in Israel. 
As a rule, our meeting houses are 
filled; but in some places there has 
arisen indifference, and where such 
neglect is seen, our brethren who 
have charge should study conditions 
and the causes of this negligence in 
regard to attending meetings. 

We are commanded by the Lord 
to go to His house on the Sunday. 
The Sunday has been declared His 
holy day, and He commands us to 
go to His house and there offer up 
our oblations, there renew our 
covenants in the sacrament, there 
listen to those who shall address us, 
and take part in the worship of 
God. This duty cannot be neglect- 
ed without our sustaining a great 
loss. Brethren and sisters, let us be 
thankful that God has given us the 
faith and a testimony of the truth, 
and has given us a testimony that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet, and 
that his successors have been men 
appointed by Him. We know this. 
This is our testimony, when we are 
called upon to speak, for we feel it 
within our heart of hearts. Now 



let us carry out in our every-day 
life that which we know to be right, 
and the blessings of the Lord will 
attend us. May He bless the con- 
gregations of the saints. May He 
bless us in this conference ; bless the 
speakers who shall address us, that 
such things may be brought forth as 
shall be for our best good. I ask 
it, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PREST. JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

The Saints should emulate President Jo- 
seph F. Smith's example of faithful- 
ness. — Satisfaction found in the procla- 
mation of the Gospel. — Cheerful re- 
sponses to calls for missionaries. — 
Folly of wandering in search of bet- 
ter locations. — Loyalty to the flag, 
land, and laws of the country enjoined. 
— Moral training of children an im- 
portant duty. — Teachings of the Mor- 
mon Priesthood always inculcate vir- 
tue, honesty, and all righteous prin- 
ciples. 

I have very great pleasure in 
welcoming you, one and all, to this 
conference, and endorsing with all 
my heart the good words that have 
been spoken by President Smith and 
President Lund in their addresses 
before you this morning. I am 
grateful, indeed, for the blessings of 
the Almighty, which we have re- 
ceived as a people. I am grateful 
to our countrymen for the kindly 
consideration they have given us, 
and the fairness with which they 
have treated us in the years that are 
passed and gone. I recognize, fully, 
that there has been much misun- 
derstanding in the breasts of many 
people in regard to our purpose and 
mission in the world. 

President Smith stated to us, 
very clearly and explicitly, this 
morning, his belief in the gospel of 
the Redeemer, in the mission of the

Latter-day Prophet, in the moral 
principles and doctrines essential to 
the well-being of mankind ; and told 
of his efforts, at all times and in all 
places, to fulfill his obligations in 
honor to his God, to his country, 
and to his fellow-men. The spirit 
of his talk to us should make its 
impress upon the minds of every 
\oung man and young woman in 
this community. His determina- 
tion to serve God, to keep His com- 
mandments, to be just and fair to all 
men, to love the truth, to betray no 
trust, but to fulfill all obligations in 
honor, should commend itself to 
every right-thinking man and wom- 
an within the confines of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
and to the hearts and good feeling 
of every citizen of the United 
States. 

My brothers and my sisters, I 
trust that each one of us, as we 
shall look into our own consciences, 
weigh our own conduct, look about 
us and consider the experiences of 
our lives, shall be enabled to say 
the same of ourselves. When we 
shall have reached the age at which 
he has arrived, and when we have 
gone through varied experiences 
similar to those through which he 
has passed, I trust that our con- 
sciences shall say to us, as we stand 
in the presence of our fellow-men : 
I have betrayed no trust, violated 
no obligation, nor counseled other 
men so to do. 

President Lund has presented to 
us the conditions that exist in some 
parts of the world, in connection 
with the Gospel, the success of the 
elders in their ministry, the results 
that are coming from their sacri- 
fices and their labors. For it is a 
sacrifice to leave home and friends, 
to go forth a stranger in a strange 
land, without means, to make vour 



way among your fellows and de- 
clare your faith. It is all the more 
difficult when many of your fellow- 
men look upon you simply in the 
light of a deceiver, whose mission is 
to mislead, and whose heart is 
aflame with the purpose of doing 
wrong to his fellows. But the ap- 
proval of a man's own conscience is 
his richest earthly reward, and he is 
blest in the fulfillment of the obli- 
gation of scattering the seeds of the 
gospel of the Redeemer among the 
children of men. No man or wom- 
an can be engaged in a more pleas- 
ing and satisfactory duty, no matter 
what may be the character of the 
abuse they may receive, or the 
wrongs and outrages that mav be 
perpetrated against them. This mis- 
sion of ours is to all the world. 
When we received this gospel, go- 
ing into the waters of baptism and 
making our covenants with God, we 
took upon ourselves this responsi- 
bility to preach the gospel to every 
creature, every nation, every kin- 
dred, every tongue, and every peo- 
ple. Every man. and every woman 
who received that gospel in a for- 
eign land made the same covenant, 
and bore record that it was sent of 
God, that the angel had flown 
through the midst of heaven, having 
the everlasting gospel to preach. 
When we become conversant with 
its principles we learn to revere the 
name of the Supreme Being, we rec- 
ognize the sacredness of the mis- 
sion of the Redeemer of the world 
and the offering He made in our 
interest. When we became pricked 
in our hearts, and the voice of the 
spirit had declared to us that this is, 
indeed, the gospel of the Redeemer, 
and that He is, indeed, the Savior 
of the world, we entered the waters 
of baptism, in harmony with that 
call : "Come out of her. my peo- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pie, that ye be not partakers of her 
sins, and that ye receive not of her 
plagues." We entered into the ob- 
ligation, that, to the best of our abil- 
ity, we would make it possible for 
every human being throughout the 
earth to hear the same glad sound 
which had pricked our hearts and 
which had aroused us from the con- 
ditions that surrounded us. When 
the gospel message appeared, find- 
ing us, sometimes, in the midst of 
sin and evil, when the word was de- 
clared in our ears that the angel of 
God had come, that the truth in its 
fullness and purity was among men, 
we turned from evil practices ; en- 
tered the watery grave ; we received 
the baptism of fire and of the Holy 
Ghost; and in receiving that gift, 
we said to our God : Our time, our 
talents shall be devoted to the ac- 
complishment of this work, calling 
the children of men to repentance, 
and pointing out to them the way 
of life. It is upon this mission, in 
the discharge of this sacred obliga- 
tion, that over two thousand of our 
elders — many of them boys, so to 
speak — are to be found among the 
nations of this world, upon the 
islands of the sea. in the far east 
and the far west, in the north and 
in the south, carrying that herald, 
making that proclamation. Having 
accomplished their great mission, 
they are standing free, before their 
Maker, from the blood and sins of 
the children of this world. 

There should never be an abate- 
ment in the hearts and souls of the 
Latter-day Saints, in their desire 
for the full accomplishment of this 
wonderful work ; and how pleasing 
it is to note their response. Day 
after day, as we open the letters of 
the young elders in our mountain 
home, to whom has been addressed 
the reminder that laborers are 



needed in the field, to aid in the ac- 
complishment of the work we have 
to do, in nine cases out of ten comes 
the speedy answer: "I am ready to 
go, at the time appointed, to any 
part of the world, to fulfill my part 
in the accomplishment of that work 
of spreading truth." There are, oc- 
casionally, those who cannot at the 
present moment respond ; but where 
such is the case they say, "A year 
from now, when my business con- 
cerns are in shape, so that I can go 
in honor, I will meet that call, for 
I hold it among the most sacred of 
duties." What a word to come 
from an army of "Mormon" boys 
all over the land. While I say this 
in regard to the boys, the maidens 
also that are wanted to assist in this 
missionary labor, among the na- 
tions, make the same response, in 
the same heroic manner, and with 
the same abiding faith. My broth- 
ers and sisters, I trust that that im- 
press will grow upon our minds, 
that this work is to be accomplished 
in every land and in every clime ; 
for it was to be preached to every 
nation. Remember that. It was to 
be preached to every kindred ; it 
was to be preached to every nation ; 
and the call : "Come out of her, my 
people, that ye be not partakers of 
her sins, and that ye receive not of 
her plagues," was to be the cry 
among the children of men. 

There are a number of subjects 
upon which, probably, we ought to 
speak in this conference, and in 
which we are most earnestly and de- 
votedly interested. Among them is 
the one in which we see evidence of 
the drifting away from the old hab- 
it in the formation of our settle- 
ments and establishing ourselves in 
the land. There is discovered to be 
uneasiness in some sections of the 
country. There are still quite a

number of our brethren wandering 
around in the world, hunting some- 
thing better beyond our settlements. 
They have been in most states of the 
Union. They have passed beyond 
the borders into Mexico. Some of 
them have gone down into the 
South American republics. Others 
of them have passed beyond the 
borders into Canada. They are 
seen on the move, looking for some- 
thing and anticipating something 
which never comes. After wander- 
ing around the circle, dissipating 
their means, and putting themselves 
almost in a condition of beggary, 
they in many instances are com- 
pelled to return* to their mountain 
home, that they may be enabled to 
secure the necessaries of life. We 
have sought to stop this tendency 
and to call the people to an under- 
standing of their responsibility in 
caring, legitimately and properly, 
for their households, in making 
their homes and preserving those 
homes, that their children may hot 
be wanderers in the world. But, it 
seems difficult to make an impres- 
sion upon some minds in regard 
to this matter, and we feel that an 
effort should be made to preserve 
ourselves in the possession of that 
which we have, and to repress this 
spirit of wandering, wandering, and 
wandering, until it leads to our al- 
most complete annihilation, so far 
as our happiness is concerned, and 
almost as far as our physical well- 
being is concerned. 

The United States, my friends, 
is good enough for me. Anywhere 
under that flag, within the confines 
of the United States, should please 
every American, should fill him with 
hope and with faith, and none of 
you can help but' feel that hope and 
that faith when you stop to think 
and weigh the mission of that flag 



in the world, and the good that has 
come to you and yours, and the 
good that has come to me and mine. 
From a far-off land, amidst perse- 
cution and trial, my ancestry landed 
upon this continent. Under our 
flag they have endured some hard- 
ships and some privations and trib- 
ulations. Even wrongs have been 
heaped upon them by the intoler- 
ance of their fellow-men; but we 
have yet to find one of them who 
feels that that flag should be low- 
ered from the place it occupies. 
They feel that our country's laws 
should be sustained and honored by 
the children of the Latter-day 
Saints in the United States. Our 
place among men should be a place 
of honor, a place of worth, that no 
matter where found we should be 
recognized as among the most obe- 
dient, tractable, and earnest observ- 
ers of the laws of our country. In 
oUr perversions and the mistakes 
we make in life, we should not lay 
it to the flag ; we should not lay it 
to the laws of our country. We 
should not lay it to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
which under the law of God is re- 
quired to obey every constitutional 
law of this land. When we step 
aside from it, we assume personally 
the burdens and responsibilities of 
our violations of the law. May you 
and I recognize our place in the 
great scheme of life to which we 
have been called by the still small 
voice, or by the ministration of the 
elders of the Church in the world 
outside. May we continue beneath 
the folds of the flag, in this glor- 
ious land, rejoicing in the fact that 
it floats and invites us to enjoy 
every blessing and right that mor- 
tal can enjoy beneath any flag in 
the world — and many more. 

I do not wish tO drift away from 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the thought that is in my mind upon 
this question of people moving from 
our sections of the country into oth- 
er sections of the land. To the east 
of us is one of the finest sections of 
the world, a place where good 
homes can be built, where ample 
water, by labor, can be secured, and 
where industrious men, in the 
course of a few years, can stand in 
the possession of opulence and 
wealth. There homes may be es- 
tablished, and joy abound in the 
rearing of a family among friends 
and neighbors who feel, as you feel, 
reverence and respect for every- 
thing that is noble and good. 

The impress of the remarks of 
President Lund, in regard to the 
question of the guardianship of our 
children, should ever be held in re- 
membrance by Latter-day Saints. 
Their homes should be homes of 
love and peace, should be homes of 
plenty, should be homes of prayer 
and devotion. They should be 
homes where a father, loving the 
right, presides in honor, and where 
a mother loving the right, loving the 
home and all its interests, guards it 
and her children. There is quite a 
deal of carelessness and thought- 
lessness in regard to the matter of 
the mingling together of all classes 
of people, especially of young peo- 
ple, that forebodes evil of no lim- 
ited character. We should seek to 
change and limit that wrong, and 
the possibilities of that wrong. Your 
sons, in paying their addresses to 
my daughters should pay to them 
the addresses of a man that is clean, 
and moral, and sweet in his life. 
The girls who receive and enjoy his 
companionship should recognize his 
worth as a man of honor, of integ- 
rity, and of virtue. The woman to 
whom he pays his addresses should 
be above reproach, or the possibil- 



ity of censure in any respect as to 
their moral worth. When my sons 
go into your homes, to pay their 
addresses to your daughters, you 
should expect them to be men who 
are above reproach, whose honor is 
clean and free, who are as virtu- 
ous as maiden could be. Their 
hearts should be aflame with the 
true nobility of manhood, a love of 
God, love of country, love of home, 
love of faith, love of right, and be 
possessed of the dignity that should 
characterize genuine and true man- 
hood in every sense of the word. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
remember who we are ; let us re- 
member from whence we came. Let 
us remember our hope in connec- 
tion with this work which God has 
revealed, the hope in our souls, writ- 
ten there by the finger of God. Let 
us keep in mind the obligations 
resting upon us, that we would 
stand for the uplifting of the race, 
that we would guard manhood, and 
require from manhood the same 
that has been required by the world 
from womanhood ! We shall con- 
tinue to require from the woman- 
hood of our Church, the woman- 
hood of our nation, a womanhood 
so clean and so sweet that, wher- 
ever found, the impress of the no- 
bility of their character will write 
upon the souls of men — respect, 
honor, and devotion. 

Again, I welcome you to confer- 
ence. Again, I say to you, when 
you go to your homes, go with this 
impress upon your souls, that the 
Latter-day Saints love this govern- 
ment, that the Latter-day Saints 
love every truth that God has re- 
vealed, that the Latter-day Saints 
propose to continue to gather truth 
from every source in the world, and 
to utilize that truth, to the best of 
their ability, in the betterment of 



PRESIDENT JOHN HENRY SMITH.

the human family, men, women, and 
children alike. Let us keep up the 
standard of our birth, as far as it 
is possible for us to do, and let us 
teach the women who are forfeiting 
their right of motherhood, and 
trampling in the dust that call of 
God, "Multiply and replenish the 
earth," that they are on the road to 
destruction ; that it means death ; it 
means shame ; it means the blotting 
out of the purposes of God, so far 
as their acts are concerned. Let 
us say to our own womanhood, one 
and all : Motherhood is her glory, 
and the fulfillment of the position of 
motherhood places her, when her 
mission is done, in the arms and 
holding the respect of the Redeemer 
of the world and God our Father, 
the friend and guide of us all. 

Look carefully around, over the 
land ; secure good homes ; preserve 
everything of a temporal nature, 
and utilize it legitimately. Cease 
to grow in the thought of increas- 
ing extravagance and recklessness. 
There is a feeling of recklessness 
taking possession of American peo- 
ple — and it reaches us — that will, 
from time to time, write the dishon- 
or of the men, all over the land, who 
are unfaithfully handling the funds 
of other people. Wherever a man 
is entrusted with the funds of a 
people, or of his neighbors or 
friends, as a banker, as a merchant, 
or in any of the fields of activity, 
where we enter to do legitimate and 
proper business, he should learn 
that those interests should be guard- 
ed more carefully and sacredly than 
his life. But, we hear and see, up- 
on the right hand and upon the left : 
This man has gone wrong, and the 
other man has gone wrong. This 
one has made a mistake. This one 
is in the penitentiary, in connection 
with these matters, and as a result 
of these conditions has brought him- 



self into disgrace and shame. He 
has disgraced the family from which 
he came ; he has disgraced the wife 
and child with whom he was asso- 
ciated, if he had a wife and child, 
and disgraced, as far as it is possi- 
ble, the honor of his state and the 
honor of his nation. You among 
the Mormon people can write it in 
your books, that the Mormon apos- 
tles have never counseled you to 
steal. They have never counseled 
you to lie. They have never coun- 
seled you to bear false witness 
against your neighbor. They have 
never counseled you to do a wrong 
to your fellow ; not in any sense of 
the word. But their instruction, from 
the day you were born, as you have 
heard their voices in these gather- 
ings, or in other gatherings, was 
that the highest elements of your 
manhood should be developed, that 
you might be lifted up and prepared 
for the duties of life. Pay your 
debts, be honest, virtuous, truthful, 
generous, brave, with unyielding 
courage and eternal hope ; and God, 
the Father, will receive you when 
your mission in the world is done. 
They have warned you not to de- 
stroy the honor of woman. They 
have sought to guard you in the 
complete and implicit observance of 
every moral rule. Every woman has 
been warned and rewarned by the 
same voices, See to it that your 
womanhood is guarded, and that 
you live in harmony with the prin- 
ciples of righteousness and right. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
welcome you, again, and ask you to 
observe the rules of your Church, 
and you will never be far in the 
wrong. Observe the duties and re- 
sponsibilities made incumbent upon 
you and which come to you by right 
under the constitution and laws of 
vour country, and you will never go 
far wrong. It is true we have our 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



weaknesses, and we make our little 
mistakes ; but the heavy burdens of 
crime and evil will not rest upon 
our shoulders. When the time shall 
come, we will stand accepted of our 
God, because we have been true to 
Him ; we have been true to one an- 
other ; we have been true to the ob- 
ligations into which we have en- 
tered. We have been true to the re- 
quirement given of the Lord, and 
with which we have had much to do 
and say in the times past, obeying 
the laws of our country, which have 
been decided constitutional by the 
courts of our country, and doing 
that, there will be no regrets upon 
our part. None of our friends will 
feel that we have trampled upon 
them, if we have walked in this 
right and true path. 

May heaven bless every man, 
woman, and child of our land. May 
the Lord bless the citizenship of 
onr state, men of every creed and 
of every faith, if they obey the re- 
quirements of that faith in honor 
and in truth. May He bless the 
sons of the soil of the LTnited States, 
and her daughters, that this land 
may present a people to the world, 
that shall be unequalled among 
mankind in the future ; men and 
women who shall be unequalled in 
their equipment for the duties of 
life, unequalled in their generosity, 
in their bravery, in their love of vir- 
tue, in their honor of truth, and in 
their sustaining of all things that 
mean, in manhood and womanhood, 
all that is noble and good. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thv powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, 
Feed us till the Savior comes. 



Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Samuel O. Bennion.

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night. 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Rev 
L. Pratt. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform ; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

I am sure we were all very much 
delighted, this morning, to have 
with us the president of our Church, 
to listen to the strong testimony 
that he bore and to the good instruc- 
tions we received from the presi- 
dency of the Church. I rejoice in 
seeing so many faithful Latter-day 
Saints present here this afternoon, 
many that I have had the opportu- 
nity of meeting in the various stakes 
of Zion. I rejoice in the attend- 
ance of these my brethren, the pres- 
idents of the various stakes of Zion. 



ELDER CHARLES H HART.

and so many bishops and workers in 
various capacities in the Church. I 
know of their labors and their devo- 
tion ; I know of the time they are 
spending, the efforts they are devot- 
ing to the growth and upbuilding of 
the Church in the various stakes and 
wards and fields where they are la- 
boring. 

We have ample evidence of the 
divinity of this latter-day work. Our 
attention is sometimes called to the 
weight of testimony that exists in 
the world in behalf of Christianity, 
and it is asserted that the evidence 
itself is sufficient to convince men 
of the divinity of Christianity aside 
from the matter of faith or the 
whispering to them of the still small 
voice. The same may be said of the 
evidence in support of the divinity 
of Mormonism. The Lord was very 
careful in laying the foundation for 
the coming forth of Mormonism, to 
have the testimony so clear and ex- 
plicit that the understanding and 
reason of men might be appealed to. 
In addition to the appeals to faith, it 
was a part of the program that 
three men should be selected and 
called as special witnesses to the di- 
vinity of the Book of Mormon and 
its divine translation. That was 
thought of, centuries before the 
book was translated, and, of course, 
care was exercised by the Father in 
the selection of men who would be 
true to that testimony, men who 
would never falter, men who 
would not betray the trust that 
was reposed in them by the Father, 
of bearing the great honor of being 
witnesses of the divine translation 
of the Book of Mormon. They 
were true to that trust. Men exam- 
ining, from the outside, the evi- 
dences upon which Mormonism 
rests, are convinced more and more 
of the fact that these men were sin- 



cere. There was no motive for false- 
hood upon their part. There was not 
the hope of financial reward, or 
anything of that sort, that would in- 
duce them to state that which was 
false. The very fact that each of 
the three was not able to live ac- 
cording to the strict discipline of the 
Church, and the Prophet disciplined 
them the same as he would other 
members of the Church, is an evi- 
dence to all mankind that there was 
no collusion or corrupt connivance 
between the Prophet and these wit- 
nesses to the divine translation of 
the Book of Mormon. The fact that 
two of them came back into the 
Church, sued humbly to again be- 
come members of the Church, is an 
evidence that they were convinced 
to the last that the work was of 
God. The other witness who did 
not come back into the Church was, 
nevertheless, as strong in his testi- 
mony, as printed in the Book of 
Mormon, to the day of his death, as 
he ever was. One of our elders vis- 
ited David Whitmer a few years be- 
fore his death, and put in verse the 
substance of an interview with him. 
The lines were' afterwards read to 
David Whitmer, and he agreed that 
it was a correct statement of the in- 
terview. That part of the verses 
bearing upon his testimony printed 
in the Book of Mormon, is as fol- 
lows. When asked if it was true 
that he had seen a heavenly messen- 
ger who showed him the sacred rec- 
ord upon plates of gold, 

"He lifted ur> his voice, and thus re- 
plied : 

My written statement I have ne'er de- 
nied; 

I saw the angel, and I heard his voice, 
And wond'rous things, that made my 
heart rejoice. 

"This interview was sought with earn- 
est prayer,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The Prophet and three witnesses were 
there; 

But Martin, conscience-struck, de- 
clined to stay, 

And wandered off alone, to watch and 
pray. 

"I do not know the angel's rank, or 
name, 

Who on this great and glorious mis- 
sion came; 

I know that he was clothed with oow- 
er and might, 

And was surrounded with effulgent 
light. 

"No tongue can tell the glory and the 
power 

That was revealed to us in that blest 
hour; 

The plates of brass and gold the angel 
took, 

And olaced before us like an open 
book. 

"We saw the fine engravings on them, 
too, 

And heard the voice declare the book 
is true; 

No power on earth could from our 

minds efface 
The glorious visions of this trysting- 

place. 

"We've done, as then commanded we 

should do. 
And testified the 'Mormon Book' is 
true; 

And was translated by the power 
given 

The Prophet Joseph by the God of 
Heaven. 

"Thousands of people have been here 
to see 

The 'copy' Oliver has left with me; 
The characters, moreover, Martin took 
Professor Anthon — words of sacred 
book. 

"Some visit me who Mormonism hate. 
Some ranking low, and some of high 
estate; 

I tell them all, as now I say to vou, 
The Book of Mormon is of God, and 
true. 

"In yonder room I have nreserved 
with care 

The printer's copy, and the words so 
rare, 



The very words from Nephi's sacred 
book, 

That Martin to Professor Anthon took. 

"If this be not the truth, there is no 
truth, 

And I have been mistaken from mv 
youth; 

If I'm mistaken, you may know from 
thence 

That there's no God, no law, no life, 
no sense. 

"I know there is a God — I've heard 

His voice, 
And in His power and truth do still 

rejoice; 

Though fools may ridicule and laugh 
todav 

They yet shall know the truth of what 
I say. 

"I've suffered persecution at the hands 

Of hireling preachers, and their Chris- 
tian bands; 

I've braved their hatred and have them 
withstood. 

While thirsting: for the youthful 
Prophet's blood. 

"They came, four hundred strong, with 

visage bold, 
And said. 'Deny this story you have 

told; 

And by our sacred honor, we'll en- 
gage 

To save you from the mob's infuriate 
rage.' 

"A mighty power came on me, and I 
s^ake 

In words that made the guilty mob- 

bers quake; 
And trembling seized the surging 

crowd, and fear, 
But left unharmed, I felt that God was 

near."* 

The other witnesses, like David, 
remained true to the last. One of 
them, before re-joining the Church, 
in bearing a very strong testimony 
to the words he had first given, sai.d 
that by the help of God it should be 
his dying testimony ; and, strangely

enough, the same elder who heard 
him make that declaration was pres- 
ent at his deathbed, and the last dis- 
tinguishable words that he uttered 
were in confirmation and support of 
the testimony as printed on the fly 
leaf of the Book of Mormon. 

And with the eight, also, who tes- 
tified that they saw the plates, han- 
dled them, and lifted them ; al- 
though three of them sidestepped 
and were not able to endure the 
hardships that bore upon the follow- 
ers of the Church at that time, nor 
to live according to the strict re- 
quirements and discipline of the 
Church, yet those three of the eight 
witnesses never denied the testi- 
mony that they gave. 

Men are inclined to say that these 
were subjective experiences — these 
so-called miracles ; but that cannot 
be true ; that is not true. If the 
angel spoke to the Prophet Joseph 
of golden plates, there were the 
golden plates in confirmation of the 
information received, demonstrat- 
ing beyond all question that it was 
not a mere matter of the mental 
condition or the subjective state of 
mind of the prophet. 

Men realizing that there is no 
ground for questioning the sincerity 
of these witnesses, are inclined now 
to concede their sincerity, but to 
question the accuracy of their ob- 
servation. That position is as weak 
as to question the sincerity of the 
witnesses. It is a possibility for one 
individual to have a delusion of a 
single sense. That is within the ex- 
perience of, perhaps, most of us, the 
possibility of having deluded, tem- 
porarily, a particular sense, particu- 
larly the sense of sight. Many of us 
may have had the experience of 
looking out over an alkali plain and 
having it appear to us to be a lake 
of water ; or of seeing small shrubs 



at a distance which under the oper- 
ation of a mirage, appear to be tall 
trees; just as shrubs growing at or 
near the northern part of the Great 
Salt Lake appeared to Colonel 
John C. Fremont and his ex- 
plorers to be trees. But when 
we have the sense of sight verified 
by the sense of touch, or the sense 
of hearing, then we may know of a 
surety whether or not there has been 
any delusion of the sense of sight. 
It would be a very singular thing for 
two men, or more, to have the sense 
of hearing, or the sense of touch, 
or any other sense deluded in ex- 
actly the same way at the same time. 
It is unthinkable to suppose that 
the three witnesses had a delusion 
of the sense of sight and of the 
sense of hearing at the same time, 
exactly in the same way ; or that the 
three witnesses had their senses im- 
paired so that they experienced a 
delusion not only of the sense of 
sight but of the sense of touch also 
— because they handled the plates. 
They saw the fine engravings upon 
the golden plates, and observed the 
curious workmanship, the ancient 
appearance of the plates ; and, in ad- 
dition to that, they tested the matter 
with the physical sense by "hefting" 
the plates, as they expressed it. So 
that when we have all those various 
senses of the witnesses conjoin in 
bearing to them the same percepts, 
we cannot reasonably explain away 
their testimony by supposing that it 
was a delusion upon their part. 

The modern theory of psychol- 
ogists who attempt an explanation 
of Mormonism, is based very large- 
ly upon the sincerity of the prophet, 
Joseph Smith, and the sincerity of 
the witnesses, but that they were de- 
luded. But, Mormonism cannot be 
explained away on the ground of 
some psychological misinterpreta- 



18

tion or delusion. The gospel is im- 
pregnable against scrutiny from a 
psychological standpoint, as well as 
from any other standpoint that we 
may view it from. I think there 
was a purpose in having those vari- 
ous senses appealed to, just as I 
think there was a purpose in the 
manifestation of our Lord and Sa- 
vior to His disciples, after His res- 
urrection. You will remember that 
He was not content to give them a 
mere view, a mere vision of His 
person, but that they might be as- 
sured, and that the children of men 
to the latest generations might be 
assured that it was no delusion of 
the sense of sight, that those disci- 
ples witnessed in the appearance of 
the Savior to them, He said, "Han- 
dle me, and see." They were asked 
to thrust their hands in His side, 
and feel the prints of the nails in 
His hands and in His feet, to know 
that it was a bodily presence, and 
not a mere apparition, or a mere 
vision, as the atheist has tried to 
claim, and, perhaps, would have 
successfully maintained with a good 
many persons, had it not been for 
the additional evidence that was 
presented by the sense of touch. 

Neither can objection be made to 
these circumstances that are testified 
to, on the ground of the miraculous. 
Of course, the atheist states the 
question in such a form that there 
can scarcely be proof of such a 
thing as a miracle. He says : "There 
must be a uniform experience 
against every miraculous event, oth- 
erwise the event would not merit 
the appellation." He thus places 
the miraculous outside of experi- 
ence, so that the moment you estab- 
lish the fact of the existence of the 
so-called miraculous, it then enters 
the realm of that which is based up- 
on testimony or experience. There 



is this weakness to be noted in the 
strength of what is supposed to be 
according to uniform experience, 
and that is that it rests upon neg- 
ative testimony, very largely, while 
a miracle, so-called — that which is 
miraculous to us — when properly 
supported by testimony, has the 
weight of affirmative proof. Where 
a fact is properly verified, athough 
not within the realm of that which 
ordinarily occurs, yet if it is prop- 
erly attested by the affirmative proof 
it is entitled to great weight as 
against the negative statements of 
those who have not been privileged 
to witness anv such manifestations. 

The poet Tennyson, tells us that 
"faith and un faith can ne'er be 
equal powers," that "un faith in 
aught is lack of faith in all." The 
extent to which that may be true I 
shall not discuss, except to point out 
the application of it to lack of faith 
in these fundamentals that were dis- 
cussed by President Smith this 
morning; for if we have unfaith in 
the existence of God, that in itself is 
far-reaching and amounts to lack of 
faith in all. This is true, also, to a 
very large extent, in reference to 
the foundation principles upon 
which Mormonism rests. A want of 
faith in the coming forth of the 
Book of Mormon and the divine es- 
tablishment of Mormonism, and the 
prophetic mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, would be all-pervad- 
ing in its consequences, so far as be- 
lief in Mormonism is concerned. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the fact that in the establishment 
of Mormonism, so-called, and the 
enunciation of its principles, reason 
is appealed to, as well as faith. Some 
one has asserted that "faith is a 
higher faculty than reason." I re- 
joice in the fact that our gospel ap- 
peals not only to faith but also to 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN .

the reason. That is true of the doc- 
trines given us in this book that 
came to us in such a marvelous 
manner, the Book of Mormon. The 
principles announced there are rea- 
sonable, and are based on reason, 
and the same is true in reference 
to the glorious doctrines contained 
in that other product of nineteenth 
century inspiration, the Doctrine 
and Covenants. I do not feel to 
enter upon a discussion of that field, 
of the beauties of the principles con- 
tained and announced in those 
books, of the way in which they are 
supported by the writings of the 
philosophers, nor of the way in 
which they appeal to our reason. 

May the Lord bless us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, and enable us to re- 
alize, deep down in our heart of 
hearts, the truths of Mormonism, 
its divine founding, that it is God's 
work, that He has guided it in the 
past and will continue to guide it in 
the future. May we be faithful 
and true to the trusts reposed in us, 
and do our part in helping to es- 
tablish this great work in the earth, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus, 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MUHRIN. 

( Of First Council of Seventy.) 

I attended a fast meeting last 
Sunday afternoon, my brethren and 
sisters, and immediately after the 
bishop of the ward had made the 
announcement that the time would 
be given to the people of the ward, 
one of the sisters instantly arose to 
her feet. She made the statement 
that she had frequently sat through 
the entire time of a testimony meet- 
ing, in uneasiness and anxiety, with 
the feeling that she ought to bear 



her testimony, but frequently she 
had sat and listened and suffered 
until the opportunity had passed by. 
The sister to whom I refer ex- 
pressed the feeling that by taking 
advantage of the opportunity of 
speaking at the very commencement 
she would be able to sit in peace, 
and enjoy the balance of the meet- 
ing. My brethren and sisters, it was 
very much of a surprise to me to be 
called upon to address this great 
gathering this afternoon. I have 
the satisfaction, however, of feeling 
somewhat as the sister I have re- 
ferred to ; that is, that through my 
turn to speak coming so early in 
the services, I will be able to enjoy 
more completely all the balance 
of the meetings, as there will be 
no reason for me having any fur- 
ther feeling of anxiety as to the 
part I am to play in the conference. 
I frequently have a very great deal 
of anxiety in regard to this respon- 
sibility, and often hear other breth- 
ren express similar thoughts rela- 
tive to this duty. Yesterday I heard 
a prominent brother say he would 
prefer going anywhere, to any of 
the stake conferences, even where 
long, hard journeys had to be made 
rather than stand up in this great 
building, in a general, conference, 
and undertake to instruct the peo- 
ple. 

When a man occupies this posi- 
tion, he certainly feels that he is de- 
pendent upon the help and inspira- 
tion of the Lord, it is out of the 
question for any man, of his own 
ability, to speak words that will be 
for the encouragement and the edi- 
fication of the great number who 
gather together upon these occa- 
sions. Men also know, notwith- 
standing their weaknesses, that by 
the blessing, and help, and inspira- 
tion of the Spirit of the Lord, they 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



frequently discharge the duty of 
speaking publicly to the satisfaction 
and blessing of those who come un- 
der the sound of their voices. I trust 
that as we have been blest in the 
teachings that have already been 
delivered in our hearing, that we 
shall continue to have the blessings 
of the Lord in all that may be said 
to us in the balance of our confer- 
ence meetings. 

I rejoice very greatly in the fer- 
vent testimonies that were borne 
this morning by the president of the 
Church and his counselors. We all 
have reason to feel encouraged, 
when we discover that the presiding 
authority, the men upon whom the 
very greatest responsibility rests, 
have a perfect assurance that the 
work to which we have set our 
hands, as a people, is the work of 
the living God, that it has not been 
established by the will or wisdom of 
mortal man, but that it has come 
into existence by the decree of our 
Father in heaven. Assurances, 
through the gift, and power, and in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, have 
come into their souls concerning the 
truth of Mormonism. I suppose 
that in the heart of each of you 
who heard .these testimonies, this 
morning, there was a feeling that a 
like testimony and revelation con- 
cerning the truth had been given to 
you. I am very happy in my feel- 
ings, my brethren and sisters, be- 
cause of this same knowledge, a 
knowledge that has been given by 
the power of God. This under- 
standing can not come by the teach- 
ing of parents, or bishops, or other 
authorities alone, although all such 
precious teachings may have tended 
to help bring many of us to an un- 
derstanding of the truth. When one 
has a convincing testimony of the 
truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 



it comes by the power of God, and 
not by the teachings of men, how- 
ever precious those teachings may 
have been. 

We heard a little, this morning, 
from President Lund, in relation to 
the work of some of the auxiliary 
organizations in the Church, and 
we all know, as members of the 
church, that very great attention 
has always been given to the educa- 
tion of the young people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. It is common to hear 
from those who are not of us, and 
sometimes, to hear from sources 
that should and do know better, that 
we are a people who love ignorance. 
Our enemies say that the leaders of 
the Church do not desire the young 
people to be educated in common • 
with the young people of the na- 
tion. The story of Mormonism, in 
relation to education, when it is 
written, will be a very wonderful 
story, for the story of Mormonism 
is a story of education. It com- 
menced in the very beginning, with 
an education of the highest charac- 
ter. God, our Father in heaven, 
chose from among the great hosts 
of men who were upon the earth, a 
simple youth to introduce the great 
work of the latter days. In order 
that he might be qualified for the 
accomplishment of this great re- 
sponsibility, he was taken through 
a course of training and education 
by heavenly beings, and he was 
trained also by the revelations of 
the Lord, God of Heaven to him. 
By the intelligence that was thus 
communicated to him by the power 
of the Holy Ghost, in the very com- 
mencement, he was made to com- 
prehend and understand that the 
glory of God is intelligence and that 
"it is impossible for a man to be 
saved in ignorance." That has been 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



21 



the story of Mormonism, from the 
days of Joseph Smith up to the 
present time. 

I doubt whether any other people 
can be found, upon the face of the 
whole earth, who in addition to pay- 
ing their taxes, in common with the 
rest of the citizens, do as much per 
capita as the members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
for the education of the youth of 
the people. I am of the opinion 
that there is more given, from the 
tithings of the people, for the edu- 
cation of the rising generation than 
is given to any other one item in 
the development of the work of the 
Church. My understanding is that 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
are contributed annually, by the 
Trustee-in-Trust, to keep up the 
great Church school system that has 
been inaugurated throughout the 
various stakes in Zion. There are 
a great number of schools that have 
been planted, by the direction of the 
presiding authorities. Splendid 
buildings have been erected by the 
free will offerings of the people and 
by the assistance of the Church 
funds. Hundreds of thousands of 
dollars — possibly it may run into a 
million or more — have been given 
by the people for the erection of 
buildings wherein their children can 
be instructed in the wisdom and 
learning of the world and where 
they can be instructed also, in the 
learning that pertains to the king- 
dom of God. 

In traveling among the people, in 
visiting the various stake confer- 
ences, it has been my privilege, fre- 
quently, to meet with the young 
people who are studying in these 
various Church academies. I have 
been very greatly impressed with 
the evidences of the spirit of in- 
spiration, the spirit of the Lord 



that is manifest in the students 
and in the men and women who 
are engaged in this work, in our 
various Church schools. I am 
glad that the people appreciate, to 
a very great extent, the wonderful 
advantages that are given wherever 
church schools have been estab- 
lished, and that as a general thing 
these schools are well attended. They 
ought to be attended to their fullest 
capacity. It ought to be the cry of 
every one of these organizations 
that they are crowded to the very 
doors. This would be the condition 
if the people, the fathers and the 
mothers of the young folks, proper- 
ly appreciated the great blessings 
that come to the youth of Israel in 
being trained in the things of God. 
While the children obtain this pre- 
cious religious instruction in the 
Church schools they obtain every 
other educational advantage that 
can be had in any of the high 
schools of the state. We should not 
forget that this religious education 
is desirable and profitable above all 
other education. It is a serious 
thing, indeed, to have an education 
in the secular things of the world, 
and be ignorant concerning the will 
of God our Creator, and feel that 
we do not owe any allegiance to the 
Father that has created us, and has 
planted within us the wonderful 
power and intelligence that has so 
distinguished the human family. I 
say to all the fathers, and to all the 
mothers in Israel, take advantage of 
the Church school system, that has 
been established, that your sons and 
daughters may be educated to be- 
lieve in the precious things that 
have been revealed. In these schools 
your children are under gospel in- 
fluences not alone for the half hour 
or more that may be given to special 
religious instruction, but they are

under the spirit and inspiration of 
the Lord, in these blessed institu- 
tions, from the moment they enter 
the building in the morning until 
they leave in the afternoon. Hard 
indeed will be the heart of the boy 
or girl who can be brought under 
such influences, day after day, and 
not have their hearts touched and 
be eventually brought to believe in 
the doctrines of the Church, as they 
have been revealed in the age in 
which we are living. 

In connection with this subject, 
there has been anxiety on the part of 
the presiding authorities to know 
how all the hosts of children within 
the borders of Zion might be bene- 
fited by this system of education. 
You know when we hear the statis- 
tics of the Sunday School organiza- 
tions, we discover that there are 
over 100,000 children, enrolled in 
the Sunday Schools of the Church, 
but there are only about ten thou- 
sand of this hundred thousand or 
more that have the advantages that 
are to be obtained in Church schools. 
There has been and is now, anxiety 
on the part of the presiding author- 
ities to know how the other ninety 
thousand might be benefited. As a 
result of that anxiety, and of their 
prayers to our Father in heaven, the 
inspiration of the Lord of heaven 
came upon His servants, and they 
were directed to introduce into the 
Church what is known as the Re- 
ligion Class organization. The very 
purpose and object of the Religion 
Class organization is to bring to 
every town and to every hamlet 
throughout the entire Church the 
advantages and benefits that it has 
been demonstrated flow so abundant- 
ly from the religious instructions 
that are imparted in our Church 
schools. Yet, we occasionally learn, 
in listening to reports that are made 



in the various stakes, that there 
are men, sometimes those who oc- 
cupy positions of honor in the midst 
of the people, who do not seem to 
give that hearty welcome and that 
whole-souled support to this or- 
ganization to which it is entitled. 

It ought to be known to all the 
people that the Religion Class or- 
ganization has come into existence 
in a legitimate manner. It has had 
birth under the direction of the 
presiding authorities of the Church, 
the Presidency and the Twelve, and 
in our general conference, year 
after year, if you will take note, we 
lift up our hands supporting the 
general authorities of the Religion 
Class organization, President An- 
thon H. Lund standing as the gen- 
eral superintendent, with Elder 
Rudger Clawson and Elder Hyrum 
M. Smith of the council of the 
twelve, as his assistants. We thus 
give evidence, by our vote in gen- 
eral conference, that we recognize 
the worth of this organization, and 
that it has a place and a right in 
the midst of the people. It ought 
to be known to every president, and 
to every bishop, in Zion, to every 
father and mother, and to every 
man and woman who labors for the 
upbuilding of Zion, that there can- 
not be a properly and fully organ- 
ized ward in any of the stakes of 
Zion where there is not a Religion 
Class organization. It has come by 
divine appointment. It is for the 
blessing and preservation and edu- 
cation of the youth of the Latter- 
day Saints. The ideal to which the 
general board, and the authorities 
in the Religion Classes are laboring, 
is to bring to the children instruc- 
tion in religion every day that they 
attend the public schools. It is not 
their desire to bring this religious 
instruction into the school, or in

any way interfere with the rights 
arid privileges of children of par- 
ents who are not of us — for every 
church organization should have 
the liberty to teach to the children 
belonging to parents of such organ- 
ization, those principles that they 
believe necessary to their proper 
education in religious and moral 
truth. And that is our right, no 
matter who may oppose it. It is 
not only our right, but it is a re- 
sponsibility that rests upon us as 
men exercising authority, to take 
advantage of the opportunities that 
abound, and bring to the children 
not only one day in the week but 
two days, or more days, as it may 
be possible, according to our cir- 
cumstances, a Religion Class in- 
struction. When our children grad- 
uate from the public schools in sec- 
ular learning they should be ready 
to graduate also in religious learn- 
ing. As a result of proper atten- 
tion to Religion Class work, faith 
in God would be established in our 
children, and they would love the 
truth as it has been revealed, and 
grow up to manhood and woman- 
hood, honoring God, honoring the 
authority of His Priesthood, recog- 
nizing the fact that there are men 
called, in the age in which we live, 
to bear the authority of God. 

If our children learn to respect 
this authority and to have proper 
reverence for the men who hold the 
holy priesthood, they will be honor- 
able men and women and will bring 
joy and peace and happiness to our 
hearts. When we discover that our 
sons or daughters think or speak 
lightly of the authority that God has 
conferred upon man, we have rea- 
son to feel very anxious indeed, for 
we may know that they are stray- 
ing away from the light that has 
been revealed ; and that light, as we 



have been told, is the power of God 
unto salvation. 

I rejoice in the truth and in the 
knowledge that has come to my 
soul concerning this work. It is my 
testimony, my brethren and sisters, 
that it has been planted by the liv- 
ing God. It is the work spoken of 
by the holy prophets. God has re- 
membered the promises made to 
the prophets, and He has set His 
hand to accomplish His strange and 
wonderful work in the midst of the 
nations. The story of Mormonism, 
from its inception up to the present 
moment, proves that the God of 
heaven has planted it, that the God 
of heaven has sustained it, and the 
God of heaven will sustain it, for- 
ever and forever. That is His 
promise and his promises, praise be 
to His holy name, never fail. God 
bless you, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

( Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
this is a very exalted position for 
me to be placed in, and I consider it 
a great honor to stand before so 
large an audience of Latter-day 
Saints. I hope I shall be able to 
make you hear, as my voice warms 
up, and I trust, under the influence 
of the Spirit of the Lord, that I 
may be inspired to say something 
that will be of benefit to you and to 
myself. 

I testify to the goodness of our 
Heavenly Father in thus permitting 
to be with us the presidency of the 
Church, and especially our beloved 
President, Joseph F. Smith. He in- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



formed you this morning, so I will 
take the liberty of thanking the 
Lord on that account, that though 
his spirit was willing, his flesh was 
somewhat weak. I rejoice that, not- 
withstanding this, he is with us to- 
day and his voice has again rang 
out in the hearing of the Latter-day 
Saints, testifying of the divinity of 
the great work that he and his 
brethren are engaged in. I believe 
with all my heart, yea I know that 
he testified of a verity and truth, 
that he did not know of having ever 
betrayed a trust or broken a pledge 
to his fellow-men. I testify that 
I believe every word of his testi- 
mony, for I have been acquainted 
with him since he was a very young 
boy. My acquaintance has never 
lapsed since that time, that is, there 
is no time during that interim in 
which I have not been familiar with 
his daily walk and conversation. I 
rejoice' also, in the testimonies giv- 
en by the other members of the 
presidency of the Church. I think 
the prospects are assuring, for the 
Latter-day Saints today. For the 
blessings of the Lord that are 
poured out upon the people with- 
out measure, I rejoice exceedingly. 

I had the pleasure of being in 
Arizona, a very few weeks ago, in 
the Saint John Stake and in the 
Saint Joseph Stake of that great 
country. I think I had not visited 
the saints in that district for nearly 
ten years. I found that I was with 
old friends and acquaintances as of 
yore, and they welcomed me, with 
my fellow laborer, Elder George F. 
Richards. They gave every atten- 
tion to us and to our exhortations 
that we could ask for. I am pleased 
with the progress they are making 
for Arizona is a great country, and 
sometime, I trust, in the near fu- 
ture, it will be one of our sister 



states. They are entitled to state- 
hood, in my opinion, as much as any 
other community in this great na- 
tion. While there we had the pleas- 
ure of dedicating a new school- 
house, or a new addition to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints' Academy, and I 
must acknowledge that the institu- 
tion is a credit to the people who 
live in that land. It is a very fash- 
ionable institution, in the way that 
all the people desire to send their 
children there for educational pur- 
poses. I think it is strictly a Mor- 
mon institution, as it is called, yet 
there are many people not of our 
faith who endorse the methods of 
education there adopted, to that de- 
gree that they send their children to 
the academy. 

A few days ago, I had the pleas- 
ure of going to the National Irriga- 
tion Congress in Colorado, in the 
city of Pueblo. The traveler, in 
getting off at the depot of that city, 
is not favorably impressed with the 
appearance of the town, for there 
is nothing to be seen from the depot 
platform, with the exception of that 
building and a hotel or two nearby, 
not first class, however, but com- 
mon hostelries or inns, and a few 
saloons. But, as you go up the 
street, east, and turn north, you 
come to the city itself, and it is a 
very beautiful little city, let me as- 
sure you, of about fifty thousand in- 
habitants. They have a park es- 
tablished, and in it are growing 
beautiful shade trees of almost 
every class and kind, as well as 
flowers and grass plentifully. In 
the midst of that was the building, 
in which we held our congress, 
called the Mineral Pavilion. I as- 
sure you that between eight and ten 
hundred delegates assembled in that 
building, who were earnest and able 
exponents and educators in the mat-

ter of irrigation, and the redemption 
of the arid soils of the west. 

Ex-Governor Adams read quite a 
lengthy paper, and in the very be- 
ginning he referred to the settle- 
ment of Utah by Brigham Young 
and his band of pioneers, with fer- 
vor and with a very excellent spirit, 
and with excellent remarks in re- 
gard to that great pioneer and the 
saints being entitled to credit as the 
first exemplars in irrigation, of all 
this great western country in these 
latter times. He stated that noth- 
ing had been introduced in this 
form prior to the time of the pio- 
neers, when they began this irriga- 
tion system in the valley of the 
Great Salt Lake, just below this 
temple block, a few squares away. 

During the same time, probably, 
that the water was running on to the 
first furrows planted with seed of 
grain and potatoes, President 
Young came up to this part of the 
flat, and standing upon this ground 
said, "Here we will build the tem- 
ple of our God." The inspiration 
of that hour has come down through 
the years, and to that degree has it 
been felt that, as some have said, the 
Latter-day Saints are admirable be- 
cause they are not only a praying 
people, a God-fearing people in their 
way, but they are a working peo- 
ple who believe in combining their 
faith with their works. Hence, to- 
day, we not only call attention to the 
promise made by Brigham Young, 
but we see the result in the temple 
as it stands in all its excellence and 
beauty for the admiration of the hu- 
man family, and, more especially, 
for the admiration of those who be- 
lieve in the ordinances of the Lord's 
house. 

My brethren and sisters, I realize 
that the work of the Lord is pro- 
gressive ; hence we establish these 



great schools of which you have 
heard today, where the Latter-day 
Saint children are educated not on- 
ly in a system of general education 
for the business of daily life, accu- 
mulation for the comfort of home, 
family and friends, but they are 
educated also in the fear of the 
Lord. The Spirit of the Lord giv- 
eth them understanding, as they 
have unfolded to them the plan of 
life and salvation, in a direct and 
proper manner, taking for study the 
text books of the Church, in a series 
of order and progression. When 
they are graduated from the scienti- 
fic department, the business depart- 
ment, and the literary department, 
they have, with that general edu- 
cation, a knowledge of the gospel, 
grounded into their hearts and 
souls, as an understanding that will 
remain with them while life lasts. 
Hence, they leave the Church 
schools with a testimony of the 
Lord Jesus Christ burning in their 
bosoms. 

% I heard Brother McMurrin's al- 
lusions to the Religion class. I am 
reminded of that class by a saying 
of old Father Jacob, when he laid 
his hands upon the head of the boy 
Joseph ; he said, "The archers have 
shot at you with their arrows, but 
your bow has abode in strength." 
So it is with our Religion class. 
Some have criticised it severely, and 
reckoned it, I believe, from their ex- 
pressions of more or less disrespect, 
a non-essential in the Church. Let 
me tell you it is just as essential as 
is the Sunday School, or the Mu- 
tual Improvement, or any other aux- 
iliary organization. I was about 
to say it is of primary importance 
for our young children — and I will 
say that. It is of primary impor- 
tance that our little children begin 
their religious education when they

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



can easily learn the principles of the 
gospel, in connection with the sec- 
ular learning and schools. I am 
reminded now of a very pretty story 
in regard to a religion class school, 
and I will tell it to you. I think I 
have told it in other congregations. 
A little boy and a little girl, going 
to the district school, were invited 
by some kindly person interested in 
their welfare — for they were of Lat- 
ter-day Saint parentage — to attend 
the Religion class exercises on Fri- 
day or Saturday afternoon. They 
went to the school, and became con- 
stant attendants. One evening the 
little boy and girl sat at the table 
where their father was reading, and 
their mother was plying her needle 
for the benefit of the household. All 
at once, the little boy leaned across 
the table and whispered to his moth- 
er : "Mamma, ask papa if we may 
have family prayers, tonight- If 
he says yes, I would like to pray for 
the family." The mother turned to 
the father, who was reading his pam- 
per, and said : "Willie would like 
to have family prayers with us to- 
night." "Well," the father replied 
in a careless tone, "I don't care. If 
Bill wants to pray, let him pray." 
So, with this almost grudging con- 
sent the little boy knelt down. He 
pulled his little sister's frock, and 
she knelt down beside him. Before 
he began his prayer, he looked up 
at his mother beseechingly and 
pulled her apron, as much as to say, 
"Come with us ;" and she knelt 
down with the children, and the lit- 
tle boy prayed. The next night, the 
same privilege was asked again, and 
the little girl led in prayer. This 
continued for several evenings, and 
finally the mother was asked to 
pray. She did pray ; for, although 
family prayers had been a forgotten 
pleasure and blessing in that house- 



hold, yet she was easily reminded 
by the faith of her little children 
what a blessing it Was to have fam- 
ily prayers renewed. So the mother 
prayed. The next night came 
around, and the father sat seeming- 
ly indifferent, reading his paper as 
usual, but when prayer-time ap- 
proached, just before going to bed, 
the father looked up suddenly from 
his paper, threw it down upon the 
table, and said to the mother : "Ask 
W illie" — he didn't say "Bill" this 
time, but he said, "Ask Willie when 
it will be my turn to pray." You 
see the bars went down absolutely, 
the bars that had been placed so se- 
curely by the power of the adver- 
sary, through neglect by the head of 
the house ; but all bars were down 
now, and from that time that family 
became a praving and devout fam- 
ily. 

My brethren and sisters, there is 
no organization in the Church of 
( hrist that is unnecessary. The Lord 
does not give unnecessary revela- 
tions. He does not require work 
fii in His children that is unneces- 
sary, but He requires of them to ac- 
cept His laws, to accept and to re- 
ceive His commandments, and in 
good and honest hearts, with full 
purpose, carry out those command- 
ments and keep those laws. Those 
are the requirements. 

I must say that while I have been 
away from home, for the last few 
weeks, to those places I have men- 
tioned, and I have mingled with 
many people, many men of strong 
opinions and fervent desires, in the 
way of accumulating and benefiting 
themselves, and their neighbor after, 
I have heard nothing but praise for 
our people. We have been com- 
mended among these men of edu- 
cation, men that have opinions of 
their own in regard to developing 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG.

the country and its great needs and 
interests, meeting the same in an ef- 
fectual and scientific manner, in the 
redemption of arid soils, the plant- 
ing of trees, and the growing of 
grain and fruits to the fullest extent, 
to make our new West, if possible, 
superior to the great East in its pro- 
ductions for the benefit of the' hu- 
man family and of the race occupy- 
ing these great United States. I 
have not heard any of them speak 
disrespectfully of the" Latter-day 
Saints since I have been away ; but 
all have had a good word for Utah 
and her laboring people who are 
with them, helping to redeem the 
great West and are solving the 
problems of bringing these arid soils 
into cultivation, where homes by the 
thousands can be planted for the 
people of the overcrowded cities of 
the East and their posterity. 

My brethren and sisters, Joseph 
Smith was a true Prophet of God. 
Brigham Young had the same in- 
spiration, and when the mantle of 
leadership fell upon him, he like the 
Prophet Joseph, pointed to the West 
for a refuge, for a home for the 
Latter-day Saints ; hence our gath- 
ering to these mountains. It is ac- 
cording to the revelations of the 
Lord both by ancient and modern 
prophets, that we are here today in 
fulfillment of those great proph- 
ecies. I say to you that the organi- 
zation of the Church is as near com- 
plete as it ever has been, and in bet- 
ter and more prosperous condition 
than I have ever known it to be, and 
I have been acquainted with the or- 
ganizations of the Church for a 
great many years. I want to say, 
today, that I have in my heart the 
most sincere and deepest regard and 
veneration for our leaders, and for 



those elders, apostles, and presidents 
who devote their time and service 
to finding out and applying the best 
means and methods for educating 
the youth of Israel and bringing 
them up to a standard that shall be 
envied by all the nations of the 
earth. You mothers are not only 
mothers of children, in the ordinary 
sense of the word, but you are be- 
coming the mothers of heroes, 
mothers of those who will be great 
in the sight of the Lord and in the 
sight of the people of the world. 
Our children are being educated not 
only for the benefit of themselves 
and their families after them, but 
they are being educated to carry the 
gospel to the uttermost parts of the 
earth, to preach the Lord Jesus 
Christ, crucified for the sins of the 
world, that He might be their Re- 
deemer in very deed, and teaching 
the people the truths of the gos- 
pel as revealed through the prooh- 
et Joseph Smith, and proclaimed' bv 
those who have followed him in the 
presidency of the Church. 

My brethren and sisters, mav the 
Lord bless you forever. May vour 
coming to conference be a bles'sing 
to you and to your children and 
to your families whom you have left 
at home. May His blessing be up- 
on you while you are here, and, 
when you return, that no evil or ac- 
cident may happen to any of you, 
but that you may go in peace to 
your homes, near-by or distant, car- 
rying with you the spirit of testi- 
mony, that has been so prevalent in 
this conference. May the blessing 
and favor of the Lord attend you 
and your children, and your families 
everywhere, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

( Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

We have listened to a number of 
very strong testimonies that have 
been given to us during this confer- 
ence, of the divine mission of Mor- 
monism, and the divine mission of 
those men whom the Lord raised up 
to establish this great work in the 
earth, and through whom the ever- 
lasting gospel has been restored to 
the children of men. I feel sure 
that the Latter-day Saints who have 
been favored with hearing these 
testimonies feel to reioice, this day, 
in the knowledge that those who 
testified have spoken the truth. 
There are many thousands of Lat- 
ter-day Saints who can bear witness 
to the same thing. There are many 
more connected with the Church 
who. probably, feel they have not 
yet received a sufficient personal 
testimony for themselves, and yet I 
believe that within them there is a 
spirit that bears witness to the truth 
of this great work. I do not re- 
member when the first testimony of 
this truth came to me. It seems to 
me that I have always known Mor- 
monism to be the truth. T can re- 
call, when I was but a small boy, 
probably a short time after my bap- 
tism at about the age of eight when 
the Spirit almost lifted me from my 
feet I felt so happy and light of 
heart and I felt that God was with 
me that He lived, and gave joy to 
my soul. T have often thought of 
this little experience which hap- 
pened upon the south bank of City 
Creek, as I was coming home from 
school. So vivid and so plain was 
this manifestation that I have never 
been able to forget it ; it has always 
been a pleasant memory to me, and 
one might well think, what was it 



that gave me such extreme joy? 
As I have become familiar with the 
manifestations of the Spirit, in my 
subsequent life, I have recognized it 
was the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit. I believe that the young 
men and young women of Zion have 
this testimony, and many of them 
do not even know it or recognize it 
as a testimony. Sometimes you will 
hear them say that they have not vet 
received a testimony. I believe that 
if they would consult their own 
hearts, look into their own souls, 
they would recognize that the wit- 
ness of the spirit has been with them 
many times. 

How may we come to the knowl- 
edge of the truth? This is a ques- 
tion that has deeply interested me. 
How may men and women in the 
world come to a knowledge of the 
truth, and find out whether or not 
this is the work of God ? How may 
the young people of Zion, who imag- 
ine sometimes that they have not yet 
received this testimony, how may 
they come to a knowledge of the 
truth ? The Lord has marked out the 
path and the way by which we can 
receive this testimony, that we may 
obtain a witness for ourselves. Under 
the revelations that have been given 
to the children of men we can find 
many items that will lead us on, and 
cultivate faith. We may find a great 
many things recorded in the scrip- 
tures and in the modern revelations 
that have been given to this people, 
that will awaken faith in the hearts 
of the children of men. We may 
find by logic and by reason the ex- 
cellency of those principles that have 
been revealed in the day and age 
in which we live. We may come, 
through our reasoning faculties, to 
a great degree of knowledge and 
understanding. We may find many 
things to corroborate the truth as it 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



29 



has come to us. We may have wit- 
nesses that the Lord has raised up 
— concerning- whom Brother Hart 
gave us an account here this after- 
noon — to come and bear witness to 
that which the Lord has revealed to 
them. But, I wish to call attention 
to this fact, that no man or woman 
can know the truth until God shall 
reveal it to him or her. No man can 
know the things of God, but the Spir- 
it of God can bear witness of their 
truth ; and it is absolutely essential 
to every one who would know that 
this is indeed the work of God, be- 
yond all question, that he shall 
obtain first the Spirit of God. i\s 
this Spirit will not and does not 
dwell in an unclean tabernacle, it 
follows that we must cleanse and 
purify our hearts by sincere faith in 
God, and repentance from sin. 
Every soul that will adopt this 
method and seek to obtain forgive- 
ness of sin, from Him who alone 
can remit our sins, through the holy 
waters of baptism, he shall come to 
a knowledge of the truth. If, per- 
chance, after these initial ordinances 
of the gospel have been complied 
with, you find yourself still lacking 
in knowledge and understanding, 
and in a testimony, do not blame in 
any degree the ordinances them- 
selves or the truth of those princi- 
ples, but look deep into your own 
souls, into your own hearts, and you 
will find the reason there and no- 
where else. 

Latter-day Saints should be am- 
bitious to grow in knowledge of the 
truth; and if we shall know, even 
better than we do today, all that we 
need do is to be better than we are 
today, to be purer in our thoughts, 
to be holier in our lives, and our 
knowledge will increase in propor- 
tion. The testimony of the truth 
is the witness of the Spirit, and as 



the power of the Spirit grows with- 
in us it bears witness to those things 
that belong to God and to His work. 
We will not come to this knowledge 
through the philosophy of men. 
through the testimony of others, no 
matter how much we may be aided 
and assisted in" this manner. Men 
can not come to the knowledge of 
the truth in any other way than 
through the cleansing process of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. If 
I may quote the words of the Sav- 
ior : • "This doctrine is not mine, 
but his that sent me. If any man 
will do his will, he shall know of 
the doctrine, whether it be of God, 
or whether I speak of myself." If 
men and women could come to the 
knowledge of the truth, the knowl- 
edge of God — whom to know is 
eternal life — without repentance of 
sin, without turning away from evil, 
without this cleansing process, 
what would be the result? Why, 
men would obtain that eternal life 
in their sins, and the next world 
would be no better than this. Re- 
pentance from sin is the gospel that 
we have received. This is the gos- 
pel of repentance, and it needs daily 
practice in order that we may per- 
fect ourselves, going on to that per- 
fection which will bring us to the 
complete knowledge of God. 

I bear witness that this is the 
truth, that Mormonism, which has 
been restored through the instru- 
mentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, is only another name for the 
everlasting gospel, the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, the only plan 
that ever was devised, that ever 
was revealed to man, that has with- 
in it the power of God to save the 
souls of men. May we yield obe- 
dience to its principles, practice vir- 
tue daily, and grow in the knowl- 
edge of God. May we overcome 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the weaknesses of the flesh, resist 
evil in all of its forms, and stand 
for truth. That we may do so, and 
thereby grow in the knowledge of 
God, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! 
The Latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 



The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Angus M. Cannon. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m.j Friday, Oct. 7. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Friday, Oct. 
7th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
fay President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ger- 
man E. Ellsworth. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 

flee. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

During the short time that I hope 
to be able to occupy, I shall make an 
effort to bear my testimony to the 
truth of this work. It is a very diffi- 
cult thing to do unless you have the 
spirit of testimony. My conviction 
has always been, and my instruction 
has always been given to the elders 
who were preaching the gospel, that 
when you are moved upon by the 
Spirit of the Lord, then is the time 
to testify that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that Joseph Smith is a Proph- 



et of God, for it is only under His 
influence that a testimony is of any 
effect upon the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men. 

When I think of my labors in the 
Church, and the efforts that I have 
made to do my duty, I am surprised 
as well as astonished at the meager 
information I have acquired, and 
yet, I have an abiding, unfaltering 
faith, in God the Father and in 
His Son Jesus Christ. I expect to 
always have faith, as long as I 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord, and keep myself clean, pure 
and sweet, so that the Holy Ghost 
can be with me. 

In thinking about the mission of 
our Savior, I desire to give a little 
evidence for my faith in God the 
Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ. 
I love the Lord because of His great 
patience. When I think of His pa- 
tience in creating this world in 
which we live, which they claim 
took six thousand years, that of it- 
self appeals to me. When I think 
of the patience of the Father and 
His Son with me, one of His chil- 
dren ; how, through His providence, 
His care and protection, and the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit,' that 
I have been able to do as well as I 
have, I feel to thank Him for His 
kindness unto me. Sometimes, I 
marvel that I have done as well as 
I have. As my mother once said to 
my father, during the reformation, 
when he wanted her to repent, as all 
others were repenting, she said : "I 
am surprised that I have done as 
well as I have, and if I had it to do 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



over again, I could not do as well." 
Father hardly thought that was re- 
pentance. The Lord is very patient 
with His people, with His children. 
I often think of the time when I 
was in the South, laboring as an el- 
der in Virginia. The president of 
the conference in which I was ap- 
pointed was called into Colorado to 
continue teaching the people. He 
shed tears, because he wanted to 
stay in the Southern States mission, 
and "bind up the law and seal up 
the testimony ;" he wanted to con- 
demn all the people and close up the 
mission so the end would come. 
That was in 1883. We have had a 
great many elders who would have 
closed our missionary labors, as far 
as the world was concerned, but the 
Lord is not so short sighted and 
impatient ; He has all eternity, and 
He proposes to save His children, 
"excepting the sons of perdition." 
Some of us become very impatient 
with each other because we fancy 
we are better than others, and we 
become angry with our fellow-men 
because they will not do as well as 
we do. I love the Lord because He 
causes it to rain upon the just and 
the unjust; because the sun shines 
for them as brightly as it does for 
any of His children. And while He 
is just, He is merciful. I thank 
God the Eternal Father that up to 
the present I have had the spirit of 
repentance, and while it has kept me 
pretty busy repenting, I hope I will 
always have that spirit. If it were 
not for repentance and forgiveness, 
I would become discouraged and 
discontinue my labors. I am going 
to read to you a little that has been 
culled from the Bible as to the mis- 
sion of Christ. I would quote it, 
but I never dare quote scripture, 
for after I get through quoting you 
wouldn't recognize it. (Laughter.) 



I am a little like father, when he 
used to quote scripture, he would 
say. "Well, if that isn't in the Bible, 
it ought to be in it." (Laughter.) 
So it is not safe for me to quote. 
Speaking of the mission of the 
Savior : 

Is He not that Mighty Prophet that 
should come unto the world? 

At his birth the air was filled with 
angels and over whose couch hung a ce- 
lestial star. 

Before whose infant feet the three 
wisest men of the world, representing 
the family of mankind, bowed in adora- 
tion and worshiped, as to God. 

Whom Herod, the First, slew three 
hundred and three score children in 
Bethlehem, in order to reach His life 

This is He whom John the Baptist 
proclaimed the "Lamb of God, which 
taketfa away the sin of the world." 

At whose baptism the heavens were 
opened above His head, and the spirit 
of God descended upon Him in the form 
of a dove, while the voice of the Lord, 
like the voice of many thunders, pro- 
claimed from the clouds, "This is my 
beloved son." 

At whose words the tempest became 
still, the billowy waves placid, the winds 
hushed. Who healed the sick and lep- 
rous by a word; who by a look reani- 
mated the lifeless limb of the paralytic. 
Raised the daughter of Jairus ; healed 
the Centurion's servant ; restored to life 
the son of Nain ; cast out a legion of 
devils out of Beor, the Levite ; restored 
the deaf and dumb; gave also to His 
apostles the same power to do miracles. 
Feeds at one time 4,000 men, and at an- 
other time 5,000 from a few pounds of 
bread or a few fishes which a lad could 
carry in a basket. 

Moses and Elias came from the re- 
gions of the blessed and held communion 
with the Savior. 

Who calls forth from the tomb of 
corruption Lazarus to life and health. 

Who when praying was answered by 
a voice from heaven in the hearing of 
many people. "I have glorified my 
name, and will glorifv it again." 

Was it not the Savior, at whose trial 
nothing could be found against Him, 
and who when delivered to execution by 
Pilate to save Himself and appease the 
Jews, was publicly declared to be an in- 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL.

nocent man by the Procurator, in call- 
ing for water and washing His hands 
and saying that he was clear of His 
blood for he found no fault in Him. 

Who was He, at whose crucifixion the 
heavens grew black as sackcloth, the sun 
withdrew its light, the stars shot from 
their spheres, the lightning leaped along 
the earth, the earth itself quaked, and 
the dead spring from their graves. 

Who on the third Jay burst the bars 
of the tomb, received as He walked forth 
the homage of an arch angel ; who ap- 
peared alive to His mother, to the wom- 
en of Galilee, to Mary, Martha, and Laz- 
arus, and to the apostles. Does not this 
prove Him the Christ, the Son of the 
living God? 

That to me is evidence, prepon- 
derous evidence ; it satisfies me ■ but 
as J. G. Holland said, in one of his 
writings : 

Better faith in a fable which inspires 
to good deeds, conducts our powers to 
noble ends, make us loving, gentle, and 
heroic, eradicates our selfishness, estab- 
lishes within us the principle of benevo- 
lence and enables us to meet death with 
equanimity if not with triumph in the 
hope of a glorious resurrection" and a 
happy immortality, than the skepticism of 
kingly reason, which only needs to be 
carried to its legitimate issues to beast- 
ialize the human race and drape the 
earth in the blackness of Tartarus. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
that faith, that unfaltering faith in 
the Lord ; and I have the same kind 
of faith and the same kind of belief 
in the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is 
a difficult thing, from a human point 
of view, to believe that God ap- 
peared to a bov fourteen years of 
age and revealed this work ; but 
when you take into consideration 
the teachings and revelations of the 
Prophet, this alone appeals to me 
as strongly as any evidence I have ; 
that God the Father and His Son 
Jesus Christ appeared to the Proph- 
et. Then John the Baptist appeared 
and conferred upon him the Aaronic 



priesthood; and Peter, James and 
John, the Melchizedek priesthood. 
The most perfectly organized 
Church on the earth was organized. 
I have put this matter to the test. 
I stand before you as a Seventy, a 
witness of the Lord to the nations 
of the earth, I received that author- 
ity through William M. Allred, who 
was ordained by Levi W. Hancock, 
who was ordained by Joseph Smith 
the Prophet. I have learned this 
much regarding the value of the 
priesthood, that I would rather 
place my hands upon the head of 
an elder and ordain him a seventy 
than preach the best discourse that I 
ever delivered. I feel that I have 
accomplished a great piece of work 
for God and His Church, when I 
ordain a seventy and that man goes 
forth and magnifies his calling. It 
is a living testimony that God the 
Father recognizes that administra- 
tion and that authority which I 
hold ; and in my administration in 
the Church I have multiplied evi- 
dences that the Lord has acknowl- 
edged my authority and administra- 
tions. The sick have been healed 
under my administration. I re- 
member, while in Los Angeles, an 
estimable lady interceded with me 
to attend one of their great Chris- 
tian Science testimony gatherings. 
There were over three thousand 
men and women, and they were a 
very intelligent class of people. 
They were an educated people. The 
reader, that evening* was a judge 
who had been on the supreme bench 
in one of our states ; he had been 
sick and afflicted with stomach trou- 
ble. He had resigned his position ; 
he had given up his work and his 
profession ; he said before that large 
congregation of people that he had 
been healed through Christian Sci- 
ence. He was as practical a man, 



34

as I am. He told a straight story. 
I listened to the testimony of per- 
haps fifty or more of those people, 
men and women. After their meetr 
ing adjourned, the lady who invited 
me, said : "What do you think of 
it?" Why, I said, I could put those 
men to shame ; I could bear testi- 
mony of the power of God, through 
administration under the hands of 
the priesthood, that would have sur- 
prised and astonished that assembly 
of people ; they would have been 
astounded and would not have be- 
lieved my statement. 

My brethren and sisters, I be- 
lieve in this work. I believe in the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. T believe in 
the living oracles. I honor the dead, 
but they are dead and performing 
their work behind the vale. We 
have the First Presidency and 
Council of the Twelve, and they are 
united, and with the help of God I 
want to sustain them. There are 
many things that I do not under- 
stand, that I cannot comprehend 
fully. I cannot see my way out at 
present ; but this is God's work, and, 
with the help of the Lord, I want 
to sustain the Priesthood of God. 
I love the people, and I say: God 
save the people. When I look over 
this body of men, I do not discover 
that you are very distinguished in 
appearance. Why, you are no bet- 
ter looking than I am, and I look 
pretty bad. (Laughter.) I am only 
a remnant of what I ought to be. I 
am not very well groomed, and I 
do not look distinguished ; neither 
do you. (Laughter.) You can't 
boast very much about your ap- 
pearance. We are a hard working 
people, and we would not take a 
very good picture, unless you take 
the better side of us ; but I tell you, 
in the name of the Lord, we .have 
got clean hearts ; we love the Lord ; 



we love truthfulness ; we desire to 
be honest, truthful, and virtuous. 
You can't judge us by our appear- 
ance. If you knew the hearts of 
this people, there would not be the 
bitterness there is against the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

In conclusion I will tell you a 
story, and then will close. When I 
was in California I was very low 
spirited and broken down in body ; 
and I tried to die, but I made a mis- 
erable failure of it. (Laughter.) 
One day when I was laying on the 
sand, near the ocean, I happened to 
pick up a paper, and it gave me new 
life and new energy. It was a fun- 
ny picture ; it was a picture of a 
great big monkey, it represented, 
"Fate— Th Old Monkey." It was 
an editorial. I haven't it with me, 
but I have read it a good many 
times, and I desire to make a com- 
parison. There was a very prom- 
inent citizen that had an intelligent 
monkey. He was a mischievous fel- 
low, and he just went around the 
house knocking everything down 
that he could get hold of. He 
knocked over everything that he 
came to ; he discovered that the 
things he knocked over did not get 
up again. He was just as mis- 
chievous as fate seems to be with 
us. Finally, this good citizen took 
the image of a little man, made of 
some kind of material, and placed it 
on a very strong base. It was so 
arranged that when you knocked it 
over it would come up again. So 
he set this little man in the room. 
The monkey came around, took his 
right hand and cuffed it over. To 
his surprise it wobbled a little and 
staggered, and then rose up and 
seemingly looked at him. Then he 
took his other hand and cuffed it 
again, and it came up again. Then 
he took the hand of his right leg 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



35 



and knocked it again, and then with 
his left hind leg; then he got on it 
with all four hands and took one 
hand up at a time. To his surprise, 
the little man rose up. The intelligent 
monkey almost became a monkey 
maniac. He kept at it and kept at 
it until he hated and despised the 
little man ; and whenever they 
would move the little man near the 
monkey, he would get off in the 
corner and chatter and become an- 
gry. He wouldn't have anything to 
do with the little man. The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is similar, or like that little man. 
You can knock it down one hundred 
times ; you can knock it down one 
thousand times; it may wobble, but 
it will rise up again, and it will 
keep rising up until God has ac- 
complished His work. This is God's 
work, and I look in sympathy upon 
men who oppose it. I stood on the 
street last night — something I hard- 
ly ever do — and listened to a man 
abuse the Church ; and I had to 
laugh. I was a good deal like fath- 
er was once when he was praying. 
In the midst of his prayer, he burst 
out in a loud laugh, and he said, 
"O Lord, forgive me; it makes me 
laugh to pray about some men;" 
it always amuses me when I see a 
man or a coterie of men try to 
break down this Church. I would 
say to these kind of men : You had 
better let the Church alone ; you had 
better let the people alone ; because 
you can't destroy the Church. I 
read somewhere in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, 

"Cursed are all those that shall lift 
up the heel against my anointed, saith 
the Lord, and cry they have sinned 
when they have not sinned before me, 
saith the Lord, but have done that which 
is meet in my eys, and which I com- 
mand them. But those who cry trans- 
gression do it because they are the ser- 



vants of sin and are the children of dis- 
obedience themselves." 

If there is anything we are do- 
ing, as members of the Church, that 
is dishonest, untruthful or intoler- 
ant, God has not commanded it. 
We have got to be honest ; we must 
be truthful ; we must be moral, if 
we are saved in the kingdom of 
God. I do not know just what will 
come out of our complex situation, 
but I do believe this, most ardently, 
that "every tub shall stand upon its 
own bottom." I believe that every 
man, woman, and child will have 
to have a testimony and a knowl- 
edge that this is the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
or they cannot stand. 

I pray the Lord to bless you. 
With all of my weaknesses, with all 
of my difficulties, I would like to 
see the color of a man's hair, and I 
would like to look into the eyes of 
the man that questions my loyalty 
and integrity to this Church. You 
may have to carry me ; you may 
have to be patient and longsuffering 
with J. Golden Kimball, but don't 
you question my integrity. I think 
I have given some evidence of my 
faith, loyalty and integrity. I 
learned my lesson, in this Church, 
as every man will learn it ; I learned 
it by being a stranger in a strange 
country. I learned it by traveling 
without purse or scrip, and I want 
to tell you, in the name of Israel's 
God, the Lord is amply able to pro- 
vide for His servants. You do not 
have to "trust in the arm of flesh." 
The Lord has answered my prayers ; 
He has opened up the way before 
me ; He has raised up friends upon 
the right hand and upon the left. 
That is how I secured my knowl- 
edge and information. I know, 
iust as well as I ever expect to 
know, until I see with my eyes, that 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
is a Prophet of God, and that this is 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I sustain the 
Church. I support as best I know 
how the Presidency of this Church, 
the Council of the Twelve, and the 
general authorities of the Church. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

That man must be accounted 
fortunate who in this presence, 
within the limited time allotted to 
the speakers, can present just one 
idea, clearly and distinctly, to the 
congregation. Whether I shall be 
able to do that or not, I cannot say, 
but certainly I shall attempt to do 
no more than that. 

When Joseph Smith was about 
fourteen years old, in the year 1820, 
he was much confused by reason of 
the disagreement that existed in his 
own neighborhood, between the 
various sects of religion ; and in the 
midst of it, his attention was called 
to that splendid scripture which 
says, "If any of you lack wisdom, 
let him ask of God, that giveth to 
all men liberally, and upbraideth 
not, and it shall be given him." He 
resolved to put that doctrine to the 
test, and retired to a secret place 
in the woods, where he called upon 
the Lord in earnest and fervent 
prayer. In response to this petition, 
a most splendid vision was opened 
to his mind, and he was taken into 
the presence of God, the Father, 
and Jesus, the Christ, and beheld 
them in the midst of a glory that 
surpassed the brightness of the sun 
at noonday. He saw that they, in 
form, were like men, that each was 



distinct from the other. They made 
known to him that men had depart- 
ed from the truth, as originally 
taught by the Christ, but they gave 
him to understand also that the 
time was at hand when the Church 
of Christ would be re-established in 
the earth, that the gospel would be 
restored to men, and told him that 
he was to be a chosen instrument in 
the hands of God to accomplish 
some of His mighty purposes in 
the earth. A most wonderful reve- 
lation, correcting the errors that ex- 
isted and, at the same time, giving 
promise that there should be. 
and that soon, a revelation of 
the truth in its fulness. How 
glorious that is — if it is true ! 
How many theological questions it 
would settle. How it would clear 
the field of theology of error — if, 
only, it be true ! 

Subsequent to this, the Prophet 
was visited by an angel, not some 
phantom, a creation of the fancy, 
but a real personage, a man of flesh 
and bone, raised from the dead, a 
man who came from the presence of 
God and made known the existence 
of the American volume of scrip- 
ture, by which I mean a volume of 
scripture which was brought into 
existence through the revelations of 
God to the ancient inhabitants of 
this land — the Book of Mormon — 
wherein is described the visit that 
the Christ made to this western 
world. After His resurrection from 
the dead and His ministry in Tudea, 
the Christ came here, according to 
this record, and established His 
Church, gave authority to men to 
teach the truth, and gave that same 
fulness of the gospel to the inhabi- 
tants of this western world that He 
had given to the people in the East. 
This gives an enlarged view of the 
earthlv mission of the Christ, and 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



37 



of the justice of God in dealing 
with the children of men, in that He 
gave to the inhabitants of this west- 
ern world the same opportunity to 
know the truth concerning man and 
man's salvation as He did to the in- 
habitants of the eastern hemisphere. 
How splendid all that is — if only it 
is true ! 

The Reverend Doctor Watson, 
in his most beautiful treatise on the 
"Life of the faster," says this in 
relation to Messiah : 

"Were a parchment discovered, in an 
Egyptian mound, six inches square, con- 
taining forty words which were cer- 
tainly spoken by Jesus, this utterance 
would count more than all the books 
which have been published since the first 
century." 

I believe that is true. Mr. Wat- 
son continues : 

"If a veritable picture of the Lord 
could be unearthed from the catacombs, 
and the world could see with its own 
eyes what like he was, it would not mat- 
ter that its colors were faded and that 
it was roughly drawn, — that picture 
would have, at once, a solitary place amid 
the treasures of art." 

And that also is true, such is the 
world's hunger to know something 
further concerning the Christ. Now, 
this revelation which came to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith brings a 
whole volume of scripture to testi- 
fy of the Christ. Not only fifty 
words, but fifty pages and more of 
words, that come direct from the 
Christ- and the whole book is per- 
meated by His Spirit. What a 
Christian treasure is this, and how 
the world ought to rejoice at such 
a revelation— 4f, only it is true! _ 

Subsequent to this, Joseph Smith 
testifies that an angel from heaven 
came to himself and Oliver Cow- 
derv and bestowed upon them di- 
vine authority, restored the priest- 



hood by which men were authorized 
to act in the name of God, in the 
authority of the Lord, and to have 
it of binding effect in matters per- 
taining to man's salvation. Subse- 
quently, the apostles, to whom the 
Lord Jesus gave the keys of the 
kingdom, saying to them that what- 
soever they should bind on earth 
should be bound in heaven, these 
apostles, Peter, and James, and 
John, came and conferred apostolic 
authority, a fulness of priesthood, 
upon these men, which priesthood 
holds the keys of all the offices in 
the Church, and the right to ad- 
minister in all things pertaining to 
the salvation of man, and to bring 
into existence and set in order the 
true Church of the living God, — an 
instrumentality through which the 
Lord designs and does communi- 
cate His mind, and His will, and 
His truth to the world ; a great 
teaching institution for the enlight- 
enment of the world, in which also 
God has depositied a divine author- 
ity to speak and act in His name, 
and administer the ordinances of 
the gospel for the salvation of men. 
What a splendid thing this must be 
acknowledged to be — if, only, it is 
true ! 

Again, the Lord revealed the 
great truth, through the Prophet, 
and lodged the truth with the 
Church, that God the Father and 
His Son, Jesus Christ, and men are 
of the same race; that there is 
something divine in man, an Intelli- 
gence that is not created or made, 
but is in the very essence of it akin 
to God ; and that in that divine Intelli- 
gence there are infinite possibilities. 
Development may take place from 
that germ, that shall expand into 
all that is great, and noble, and 
wise, and pure, and powerful! 
There is in that Intelligence such 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



possibilities of development that we 
may hope as eons of time shall pass 
by, to see it rise to something-- that 
is truly great and dignified, and 
worth while to preserve. How 
splendid that truth is — if, only, it is 
true ! 

So I might continue to go on, 
step by step, through the whole 
catalog of those great and true prin- 
ciples that God has revealed to His 
Church — the doctrine of resurrec- 
tion from the dead — the reality and 
tangibility of it I mean ; salvation 
for the dead ; the eternity of the 
marriage covenant, and so follow- 
ing, if time would permit ; but the 
one thought, the one idea, only, that 
I hope to suggest in these remarks 
is simply this : Since, admittedly, 
these things are splendid and glor- 
ious, if true, why will not men ap- 
proach an investigation of them 
from that standpoint? From the 
standpoint that it is desirable to 
have them established as true, if 
possible — these several events in 
which the Church had its origin, 
and these splendid doctrines which 
would mean so much for the uplift- 
ing of the race — if true? Why not 
start the investigation of this won- 
derful message which we proclaim 
to the world from that standpoint? 
It seems to me that there is oppor- 
tunity for more headway to be made 
in solving these matters, if ap- 
proached from that standpoint, than 
to approach them in the spirit of 
antagonism — since, admittedly, they 
are glorious things, if, only, they 
are true. That is the thought I 
wanted to advance to this congrega- 
tion. 

In conclusion, I want to sav this 
about it, for the Latter-day Saints, 
and that is, so far as we are con- 
cerned, it is solemn conviction with 
us, that these several circum- 



stances in which Mormonism had 
its origin are absolutely true. These 
principles that I have briefly allud- 
ed to, and many more that will na- 
turally suggest themselves to your 
minds — many more principles that 
we accept, and which minister to 
the dignity and to the uplifting of 
men, are absolutely true. They con- 
stitute the center of truth on which 
we stand, and from which we take 
our outlook upon the world. From 
this coigne of vantage we interpret 
the meaning of the universe ; we 
interpret the meaning of human 
life. This is our orientation with 
respect of things past, things pres- 
ent, and things to come. Who is 
there that can say that we do not 
occupy a most magnificent position 
from which we may interpret the 
meanings of human life, the relation- 
ship of individuals to the race, and 
the race to God, and the relation- 
ship of the individual to God? To 
my mind it presents a position of 
advantage the like of which is not 
equalled in all the philosophies and 
other religious systems of the 
world.

God, do I put my trust," was sung 
by Sister Irma Pendleton.

The sin of criticising or fault finding. — 
Wrongful accusers in danger of God's 
judgment. — Revelation an individual 
privilege. — The man quick to censure 
is often himself a transgressor. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
and sisters, in the counsel and in- 
struction that have been given unto 
us at the various sessions, so far, of 
our semi-annual conference. 

I desire to refer to one expression 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



39 



that was briefly made by one of our 
speakers yesterday, and mentioned 
again this morning, if I may be led 
and directed by the Spirit of the 
Lord ; and that is this : That it is 
a serious thing for any member of 
this Church to raise his voice against 
the priesthood, or to hold the priest- 
hood in disrespect ; for the Lord will 
not hold such guiltless ; so He has 
promised, and He will fulfill. I am 
satisfied, in my own mind, that there 
was not one person in this building 
at the opening session of our con- 
ference, who was not convicted in 
his heart in listening to the testi- 
monies and the instruction given by 
our brethren of the Presidencv, that 
they were honorable, honest, and 
upright men ; that they spoke the 
truth. I am satisfied that to the 
Latter-day Saints the conviction 
came that they spoke under the in- 
spiration of the Spirit of the Lord : 
that Spirit which they are entitled 
to possess, and which, to my own 
knowledge and satisfaction, they do 
possess. It seems to be the heritage 
of the ungodly, of the bigoted, and 
of those who love iniquity, to sit in 
judgment and to place themselves 
as dictators, saying what shall be 
done and what shall be said by the 
authorities of the Church. They 
accuse the brethren of all manner of 
iniquity, dissimulation, falsehood, 
and try to cause a division between 
them and the people over whom 
they preside. They take unto them- 
selves tlie prerogative of saying 
what shall and what shall not be the 
doctrine of the Church, what shall 
and what shall not be the govern- 
ment of the Church, when it con- 
cerns them not at all. But it is not 
of this class particularly that I de- 
sire to refer, but to those members 
of the Church who have entered in- 
to the waters of baptism and have 



made covenants before the Lord, 
that they will observe His laws and 
respect His priesthood, who have 
been persuaded, or who are in dan- 
ger of being persuaded, by such 
characters. Occasionally, when a 
man has himself committed sin and 
has lost the spirit of the gospel, he 
will raise his voice against the ac- 
tions of the authorities who preside 
over the Church ; he will call them 
in question, sit in judgment upon 
them and condemn them. I wish to 
raise a warning voice to all such 
who hold membership in the 
Church, and say unto them, that 
they had better repent and turn un- 
to the Lord, lest His judgments 
come upon them, lest they lose the 
faith and be turned from the truth. 

I desire to read a few words from 
some of our modern scriptures, that 
were also briefly referred to this 
morning : 

Cursed are all those that shall lift 
up the heel against mine anointed, saith 
the Lord, and cry they have sinned when 
they have not sinned before me, saith 
the Lord, but have done that which was 
meet in mine eyes, and which I com- 
manded them : 

But those who cry transgression, do 
it because they are the servants of sin, 
and are the children of disobedience 
themselves ; 

And those who swear falsely against 
my servants, that they might bring them 
into bondage, and death: 

Wo unto them ; because they have of- 
fended my little ones, they shall be sev- 
ered from the ordinances of mine house ; 

Their basket shall not be full, their 
houses and their barns shall perish, and 
they themselves shall be despised by 
those that flattered them ; 

They shall not have right to the priest- 
hood, nor their posterity after them, 
from generation to generation ; 

It had been better for them that a mill- 
stone had been hanged about their necks, 
and they drowned in the depth of the 
sea. 

Wo unto all those that discomfort my 
people, and drive, and murder, and testi- 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fy against them, saith the Lord of Hosts ; 
a generation of vipers shall not escape 
the damnation of hell. 

Behold, mine eyes see and know all 
their works, and I have in reserve a 
swift judgment in the season thereof, 
for them all ; 

For there is a time appointed for every 
man, according as his works shall be. 

God shall give unto you (the saints) 
knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea by 
the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, 
that has not been revealed since the 
world was until now ; 

Which our forefathers have waited 
with anxious expectation to be revealed 
in the last times, which their minds were 
pointed to, by the angels, as held in re- 
serve of their glory : 

A time to come in the which nothing 
shall be withheld, whether there be one 
God, or many Gods, they shall be mani- 
fest; 

All thrones and dominions, principal- 
ities and powers, shall be revealed and 
set forth upon all who have endured vali- 
antly for the gospel of Jesus Christ ; 

And also if there be bounds set to 
the heavens, or to the seas, or to the 
dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars ; 

All the times of their revolutions; all 
the appointed days, months, and years, 
and all the days of their days, months, 
and years, and all their glories, laws, 
and set times, shall be revealed, in the 
days of the dispensation of the fullness 
of times. 

According to that which was ordained 
in the midst of the Council of the Eter- 
nal God of all other Gods, before this 
world was, that should be reserved unto 
the finishing and the end thereof, when 
every man shall enter into his eternal 
presence, and into his immortal rest. 

How long can rolling waters remain 
impure? What power shall stay the 
heavens? As well might man stretch 
forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri 
river in its decreed course, or to turn it 
up stream, as to hinder the Almighty 
from pouring down knowledge from 
heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Again I repeat that it is a serious 
thing for a man holding a member- 
ship in this Church to say in his 
heart, or openly, that these men 
holding the keys of the kingdom 
have sinned, when they have not 



sinned, and cause dissension, if it 
is in his power to do so among his 
brethren. The judgments of the 
Lord will overtake him. He will 
be brought in question before the 
Lord, and shall be cast out and find 
his place among the unbelievers; 
and those who flattered him and en- 
couraged him to raise up his heel 
against his brethren will turn from 
him and leave him to his shame. I 
wish to testify that God has called 
these men, that He has appointed 
them, that He has given unto them 
the revelations of His mind and 
will ; that they have the inspiration 
of His Spirit; that they are teach- 
ing and leading this people in truth. 
That is the conviction of every Lat- 
ter-clay Saint who has the gospel at 
heart. What time, since the organ- 
ization of the Church has any of the 
brethren, exercising the Spirit of 
the Lord, ever taught this people 
that which was false ? When have 
they ever said unto you that you 
should do that which was not right ; 
that which would not make you bet- 
ter citizens and better members of 
the kingdom of God? You cannot, 
nor can any man, in righteousness, 
point to the time when any of them 
have wilfully stated anything that 
was contrary to the principles of 
righteousness, or that did not tend 
to make the people better in every 
way, that did not build them up in 
their salvation, temporally as well as 
spiritually. 

Now, if time would permit, I 
would like to say a few words in 
relation, also, to the part of this 
scripture I have read, regarding the 
pouring out of revelation. I shall 
only briefly refer to it. I say to 
you that the Lord blesses this peo- 
ple through the inspiration that 
comes to His servants, as they di- 
rect, and teach, and expound the

scriptures. The statement is often 
made by the enemies of the people, 
and we hear it upon the streets of 
this city, from time to time, that 
there is no revelation in the Church. 
I say to you that there is revelation 
in the Church. The Lord not only 
blesses the men who stand at the 
head and hold the keys of the king- 
dom, but He also blesses every 
faithful individual with the spirit 
of inspiration. He gives His peo- 
ple revelation for their own guid- 
ance, wherein they keep His com- 
mandments and serve Him. That 
is a blessing promised, and within 
their power to receive. We are blest 
with revelation ; the Church is built 
tipon that foundation. All the rev- 
elations given do not have to be 
written. The inspiration may come 
to the brethren, stating what shall 
be done, or what shall not be done, 
a- the Lord directs them. It does 
not have to be printed in a book. 
We have revelations that have been 
given, that have been written; some 
of them have been published ; some 
of them have not. Don't be de- 
ceived by those falsifiers, those men 
whose hearts are filled with evil, 
and who say that the authorities 
have sinned when they have not 
sinned, who are themselves in the 
bondage of iniquity and are trying 
to destroy this work. So far as those 
men are concerned, who try to tear 
down and destroy, they do not 
preach that which they themselves 
believe. They do not teach the peo- 
ple that which is true or try to show 
them a better way, instead, they 
heap abuse upon the heads of the 
authorities of the Latter-day Saints. 
Whenever you find a man who 
spends his time abusing his neigh- 
bors, trying to tear down other peo- 
ple, you put it down that that man 
is not possessed of the Spirit of the 



Lord. But when a man tries to 
build up, when he tries to show you 
a better way, even though he be de- 
ceived, you may know that he is 
honest ; but never the man who tries 
to tear you to pieces, who tries to 
destroy, without offering you some- 
thing better in return. Never is 
such a man honest. 

Thank the Lord for the gospel ; 
thank the Lord for the priesthood, 
and for the testimony which we en- 
joy that this is the. work of God. 
May this be the blessing of each 
one of us, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Professed teachers of God's word must 
proclaim truth only. — The Church de- 
sires its doctrines judged by the Bi- 
ble. — Proof that angels have been 
mortal men. — Misrepresentation the 
usual weapon used against the Church. 

There shall be false teachers among 
you * * and many shall follow 
their pernicious ways : by reason of 
whom the way of truth shall be evil 
spoken of. 

Elder Roberts, in the course of 
his very brief remarks — and only 
brief remarks can be made in the 
limited time which is allotted to us, 
this morning — stated that the fun- 
damental doctrines of the Church, 
to which he referred, are true. It 
is upon these doctrines that the 
structure which we have builded 
rests ; if they are not true, our hope 
is vain. He said unequivocally that 
these doctrines are true. I know 
that this statement of his is not suf- 
ficient evidence ; I know that it is 
not proof of his assertion ; because 
other men, stating it is not true, 
might regard, their evidence and the 
declarations which they make as 
equally in force, unless our state- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ments can be sustained by proof. 
We are living in a time of misrep- 
resentation, a time when, it seems 
to me, that the words quoted, which 
the Apostle Peter spoke to the 
Church of Christ in which he ad- 
ministered, are exemplified in the 
fullest degree. I believe that I 
sense the responsibility which 
rests upon me when I stand up 
here, professing to be a teach- 
of the word of the Lord, to 
speak the truth. I do not believe 
that it is my prerogative, either, in 
advocating my own faith, or in crit- 
icizing the faith of another, to speak 
that which is not true. I must not 
be a false teacher, and it must not 
be by reason of my words that the 
truth is evil spoken of. It is not of- 
ten that the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints pays attention 
to misrepresentations, but, when 
their doctrines are ridiculed, when 
they are misrepresented, when they 
are spoken of with contempt, and 
when these things are published and 
sent broadcast to the world, by which 
men and women follow after the 
falsehoods which are told, it be- 
comes necessary, sometimes, to cor- 
rect them, and expose the false basis 
upon which men reached conclu- 
sions in regard to the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

From one of the local papers, I 
clipped this report of a sermon 
which was preached in this city, 
only a short time ago, by a rever- 
end gentleman. This report ap- 
peared in a paper having a wide cir- 
culation, and I thought to myself, 
wherever that shall go, among peo- 
ple who are not acquainted with 
the Latter-day Saints, who know 
nothing of their doctrines, impres- 
sions that are very wrongful must, 
necessarily, result. This man pre- 
tends to be a teacher of the word 



of the Lord, as it is contained in 
the Bible; and one of the charges 
which he makes against the Latter- 
day Saints is that they do not like- 
to have their faith compared with 
the doctrines of Christ, as thev are 
contained in the Bible ; that thev do- 
not like to be held up against it. 
I will read, so that I may not be 
accused of misquoting his words : 
"I know that the Mormon church 
does not like to be stood up by the 
side of the Bible and compared with 
it." Then follows a tirade against 
the church. I wish to say to that 
man and to the world, and to my 
brethren and sisters, that there is 
nothing which the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints more 
desires than that they may be stood 
up alongside of the Bible. It is the 
one thing which they are endeavor- 
ing, in their missionary work, to 
bring to the attention of the world. 
It is their one great desire that the 
doctrines of the Church mav be 
judged by the word of God. as it 
is contained in this holy book. The 
man who says to the contrary mis- 
represents the fact, and if he is ac- 
quainted with the subject which he 
discusses, he knows that he misrep- 
resents the facts ; and if he is not 
acquainted with the subject, he is, 
nevertheless, guilty, for he has no 
right to discuss that which he does 
not understand. I want to say, as 
Brother Roberts does, that every 
one of the doctrines of this Church, 
its articles of faith, as promulgated 
to the world by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and the revelations of God, 
which are contained in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, are absolutely im- 
pregnable from a Biblical stand- 
point. There isn't one of them 
that can be successfully assailed ; 
and this man ought to know it r 
whether he does or not.

I have read this discourse over 
and over again, in the hope that I 
might find in it something to indi- 
cate sincerity, something to indi- 
cate intelligent investigation, but I 
have not found it. He assails the 
Prophet Joseph Smith; he ridicules 
and scorns the thought of modern 
prophecy. He ridicules the Book of 
Mormon and, particularly, the man- 
ner in which it was brought into 
existence. Let me read just a few 
words here, which will illustrate 
this point Quoting from the 
Prophet Isaiah, he says: "To the 
law and the testimony; for if they 
speak not according to these, it is 
because there is no truth in them." 
I am glad he quoted that scripture, 
because I want — just for a moment, 
if I have time — to apply the law 
and the testimony to him. "Take 
the origin of the Book of Mormon, 
to begin with— I am just going to 
give you a sample — it is said that 
Moroni, an angel, once a man, di- 
rected Smith to the gold plates from 
which it is claimed the book was 
translated. Now, the unreasonable- 
ness of this is quickly shown. First, 
while men may become equal to the 
angels, they never become angels. 
Angels are an order of beings 
greater than and created before 
man." Upon this he bases his ar- 
gument that the Book of Mormon 
must be an imposture, that it could 
not be true, because Joseph Smith 
claimed that Moroni, the man who 
visited him, the man who instruct- 
ed him, the man who outlined to 
him the great mission which God 
had for him to perform, and the 
man — for I call him a man— who 
delivered into his hands the plates 
from which the Book of Mormon 
was translated, is called an angel, 
and because he had once been a 
man. Now, my brethren and sis- 



ters, the Lord uses men to accom- 
plish His purposes here in the 
earth. This earth was created for 
man, and he was placed upon it that 
he might here work out his salva- 
tion, that he might live this life of 
probation and prove himself 
worthy, or unworthy, of everlasting 
life. There has never been a dis- 
pensation, there has never been a 
word of revelation given, by which 
mankind is to be governed, so far 
as I am aware, that has not come 
through some man, from God, 
through His servants. This is our 
world. We are in it, and we are 
interested in it. Whatever we shall 
accomplish will be through our own 
effort; and God will manifest His 
will to us, through men, as He al- 
ways has done. It may come by 
His own voice to His servants ; He 
may send ministering spirits to ad- 
minister to them ; but it comes to 
the people through the voice of men 
chosen of God. 

Now, I just want to quote one 
passage of scripture — and the Bible 
is full of just such things as I am 
about to refer to here — -to show you 
the inconsistency of this man's ar- 
gument, and to show you the way 
of the Lord. The Lord has His 
own way of doing these things. Un- 
fortunately, men too often place 
their own private interpretation up- 
on them. The Lord once gave a 
revelation to John, His loved dis- 
ciple, who was, at the time, upon 
the Isle of Patmos, in which he 
reveals to us some of the most im- 
portant things that ever have been 
given to man ; and this is the way 
He did it : "The revelation of Jesus 
Christ which God gave unto him, 
to show unto his servants things 
which must shortly come to pass ; 
and he sent and signified it bv His 
angel unto His servant John." 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



This seems very clear ; he sent and 
signified it by His angel unto His 
servant John, just as He has a habit 
of doing - ; and that angel outlined 
to John things which were to oc- 
cur in the earth, from the begin- 
ning to the very end thereof, that 
wonderful book, the last book of the 
Bible, which we call Revelation, or 
the Apocalypse, gives this account : 

And he said unto me. These sayings 
are faithful and true ; [so testified the 
angel unto John]. 

And I John saw the^e things, and 
heard them. And when I had heard and 
seen, I fell down to worship before the 
feet of the angel which showed me these 
things. [Now. what follows?! 

Then saith he unto me, See thou do 
it not; [Why?l for I am thy fellow ser- 
vant, [this angel of God whom He had 
sent] I am thy fellow servant, and of 
thy brethren the prophets, and of them 
which keep the sayings of this book 

So, it seems that Moroni was not 
the first angel whom God had sent 
^ ith a message to the inhabitants 
of the earth. It seems that he was 
not the first angel who had had a 
-imilar commission, and who had 
heen a prophet, for this messenger 
bears witness to Tohn that he him- 
self was his fellow servant of the 
^roohets and of those who keep the 
sayings of this book. But. yet. this 
man would undertake to make peo- 
ple believe that because of the fact 
that Joseph Smith thus received the 
w ord of God. he was an impostor. 

He follows this up by making 
another erroneous statement: "Jo- 
seph Smith and his successors also 
teach the continuation of an Aa- 
ronic priesthood since the cross ; 
that Mormonism holds it. That, 
loo, is in direct conflict with the 
holy scriptures." Has any one ever 
heard the doctrine by an elder of 
this Church that the Aaronic priest- 
hood had continued since the cross? 



I would like to read here again, just 
a short extract from Joseph Smith's 
statement : 

We still continued in the work of 
translation, being the 7th of April. I 
commenced to translate the Book of 
Mormon, and he began to write. [Re- 
ferring to Oliver Cowdery]. We still 
continued the work of translation when, 
in the ensuing month of May, 1829, we 
on a certain day went into the woods to 
pray and inquire of the Lord respecting 
baptism for the remission of sins, that 
we found mentioned in the translation 
of the plates. While we were thus em- 
ployed, praying and calling upon the 
Lord, a messenger from heaven descend- 
ed in a cloud of light. Having laid his 
hands upon us. he ordained us saying: 

Upon you my fellow servants, in the 
name of the Messiah, T confer the 
Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the 
keys of the ministering of angels, and of 
the gospel of repentance, and of bap- 
tism by immersion for the remission of 
sins; and this shall never he taken again 
from the earth, until the sons of Levi do 
offer again an offering unto the Lord 
in righteousness. 

He said that this Aaronic priesthood 
had not the power of laying on hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that 
this should be conferred upon us here- 
after. He commanded us to go and be 
baptized; gave us directions that I 
should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and af- 
terwards that he should baptize me. 

So, my brethren and sisters, the 
Latter-day Saints do not claim the 
continuation of the Aaronic priest- 
hood from the cross, but that in the 
year 1829, as stated in this brief 
account which is given bv the 
Prophet, it was restored to the earth 
by John the Baptist, another angel 
who had been a man. the same man 
that had been beheaded by Herod 
of Jerusalem, because he bore wit- 
ness against his iniquity, the same 
man who held the keys of the Aa- 
ronic priesthood in the meridian of 
time, the same man who baptized 
the Savior of the world in the river 
Jordan. Who had a better right? 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 



45 



Who more logically, who more na- 
turally, who more reasonably should 
have restored the keys of that 
priesthood in this dispensation than 
John the Baptist? He bears wit- 
ness here that he was that John who 
was called John the Baptist. 

I shall not continue to discuss 
this sermon ; but I call your atten- 
tion to the fact that just such ser- 
mons as this are being sent broad- 
cast, in which the faith of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints is misrepresented, in 
which it is held up to ridicule. Boys 
and girls do not like to have the 
finger of scorn pointed at them, or 
the faith of their fathers held up to 
derision ; and there is nothing else 
in this sermon from beginning to 
end. Not in one single instance has 
this man attempted to prove that 
the faith of the Latter-day Saints is 
not based upon the doctrines of 
Christ, as they are taught in the 
Bible, except the one that I have 
quoted. That is the only scripture 
that he quotes to sustain his conten- 
tion, and I have shown you how 
ridiculous that contention is. Do 
not be influenced, neither saint nor 
sinner, Latter-day Saint nor unbe- 
liever, by such sophistry. Before 
vou reach conclusions, investigate 
this question. There may be some 
excuse for men who reason from 
their own philosophy; there may 
be some excuse for men who do not 
profess to be believers in the Bible ; 
but for these professed teachers of 
Christianity, these men who profess 
to make the Bible the basis of their 
faith, I say that they are inconsis- 
tent; I say that they are either in- 
sincere and wilfully wrong, or else 
they are woefully ignorant of the 
subjects which they treat. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints stand before the 
world today with the Bible as the 
basis of their faith. Nothing would 
make them happier than that we 



all come together and, making that 
the basis of our faith, be governed 
by it. We are willing to be judged 
by that rule, by the law and the 
testimony. "If they speak not ac- 
cording to that, it is because there 
is no light in them." 

That is just exactly what is the 
matter with the world. They do 
not accept the Bible as the word of 
God, notwithstanding the fact that 
they profess faith in it. They teach 
for doctrines the commandments of 
men; they divine for hire; they 
preach for money ; and their stock 
in trade, particularly, just at the 
present time, seems to be to be- 
little the Church of Christ and the 
Latter-day Saints. They will fail 
just as ignominiously as have every 
other people failed who have raised 
up their voices against the kingdom 
of God. They will be just as great- 
ly disappointed as is a hungry man 
who, in his sleep, dreams that he 
eats, and thinks that he is satisfied ; 
but when he wakes, he finds that 
he is still hungry. Or a thirsty 
man who, in imagination, drinks 
in his sleep, and thinks that his 
thirst is quenched ; but when he 
arises his soul still has aopetite. A 
man remarked, only a few days 
ago, so I was informed by a friend, 
that it was only a question of a lit- 
tle time till the Mormon Church 
would fall of its own weight. Take 
the advice of Gamaliel then, and 
just let the Church alone, let it fall 
of its own weight. It is not in- 
juring anybody; it is only seeking 
to establish righteousness, preach- 
ing only the doctrines of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. It is only hold- 
ing up to the world the word of the 
Lord as it is contained in the Bi- 
ble ; and if we do, also, contend that 
the Book of Mormon contains the 
word of God, it is a very easy mat- 
ter to prove it by comparing it with 



46

the doctrines in the Bible, and we 
are vindicated there, iust as we are 
upon every other point. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, re- 
member this ; do not forget it : You 
are a thoughtful lot of men and 
women. Think of yourselves ; act 
-for yourselves ; know for your- 
selves, right from wrong; do what 
God shall manifest to you is your 
duty, every day of your life. The 
Lord will take care of this work ; 
He will magnify it ; and it will nev- 
er fall of its own weight, but it will 
continue to grow stronger every 
day, from this day henceforth, un- 
til it shall prevail in all the world. 
I bear this testimony to you, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith said, 
"I think the sentiment expressed by 
the Apostle Paul is very appropri- 
ate at this moment — T am not 
ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for 
it is the power of God unto salva- 
tion.' And we have it." 

President Smith stated that an 
entertainment bureau had been es- 
tablished in the office of Elias Mor- 
ris & Sons, at South Temple and 
Richards streets, and that those who 
lacked places of entertainment 
might report there and be supplied. 
Those having places to offer for 
lodging and boarding during con- 
ference were also invited to notify 
the entertainment committee. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 



Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder George Osmond. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., in the Tabernacle. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the congregation to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled.? 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wil- 
liam A. Moody. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that "Prophet and 
Seer"— 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Inestimable importance of a testimony 
of the truth. — Reputation for good 
standing in Church inspires confidence. 
— Truthfulness of individual testimony 
oroven by life. — The world arraigned 
by reverend gentleman. — True Saints 
will manifest they are governed by 
truth. 

"Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah !" And praise 
to the people who know that he held 
that communion. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

The testimonies that have been 
1x>rne throughout this conference 
Tiave been most impressive. When 
one thinks and realizes that the 
thousands of Latter-day Saints who 
listened to those testmonies can bear 
the same kind of testimony truthful- 
ly, one realizes what a blessed peo- 
ple we are. No greater gift or bless- 
ing can come to man in this life 
than a knowledge that God lives, 
that Jesus is the Savior of the world, 
and that these two personages did 
actually appear to the Prophet Jo- 
seph and restore, through him, the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I say that 
no greater gift or blessing can be 
enjoyed by man in this life. He 
who knows these things possesses 
the keys to the true philosophv of 
life. He who knows God and Jesus 
Christ whom He has sent, has eter- 
nal life, the greatest gift that can 
come to man. 

It is not my purpose to dwell up- 
on the gloriousness of the testimony 
of the truth of this gospel. I want 
to add my own to those testimonies 
which have been borne in other ses- 
sions of this conference. I know 
that this is the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and I thank God, this day, 
for that testimony. I know that the 
men who have been called to lead 
this, Christ's Church have been ser- 
vants and are servants of God ; and 
you know it, my brethren and sis- 
ters ; and I rejoice in your fellow- 
ship and in your brotherhood. God 
belp us to be true to this testimony. 

I am reminded that when Christ 
was on the earth, He said to some 
men who also knew of His divinity, 
that there was an obligation upon all 
such who possessed the knowledge 
of the existence of God and of the 
truths of the gospel of Christ. "He 
that knew not, and did commit 
things worthy of stripes, shall be 



beaten with few stripes. For unto 
whomsoever much is given, of him 
shall be much required ; and to 
whom men have committed much, 
of him they will ask the more." So 
with this knowledge that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints possess there comes a 
mighty obligation. God's people 
are spoken of in scripture, ancient 
and modern, as a chosen people, as 
a royal priesthood, a peculiar peo- 
ple, as a light set upon a hill. "Ye 
are the light of the world. A city 
that is set on a hill cannot be hid. 
-Neither do men light a candle, and 
put it under a bushel, but on a can- 
dlestick ; and it giveth light unto all 
that are in the house. Let your 
light so shine before men that they 
may see your good works, and glor- 
ify your father which is in heaven." 

There are two virtues, I will call 
them principles, that I wish to em- 
phasize, this afternoon, as worthy of 
our thought and our increased ef- 
fort to establish them among men. 
The first is truth. Recently, while 
visiting a stake of Zion, established 
in a neighboring state to Utah, I 
listened to one part of a conversa- 
tion carried over the telephone. The 
president of the stake was called 
from the dinner table to the 'phone, 
and this conversation followed I 
was told that which I did not hear, 
so can give it to you in full. "Do 
you know," said the stranger, a non- 
member of the church, to the presi- 
dent of the stake, "do you know Mr. 
So and So?" "Yes." "Is he a 
member of your church ?" "He is." 
"Well, is he in good standing in 
your church?' "Yes.' "All right; 
thank you. He is here in our office 
desiring to borrow some money to 
make an investment. He referred 
us to you, and said he was a mem- 
ber of your church. If he is in good 
standing, we will lend him the mon-

ey." Oh, that confidence ! My 
heart rejoiced, and it rejoices today 
that, so far as honesty and integrity 
are concerned, the Church of Christ 
is a light. You and I grieve most 
deeply when we hear of a member 
who forgets himself and destroys, 
by his dishonesty, that confidence. 
Christ stood before Pilate a pris- 
oner,, and was asked, "Art thou the 
King of the Jews?" "Sayest thou 
this thing of thyself, or did others 
tell it thee of me?" Pilate evaded 
the answer by saying, "Am I a 
Jew ?" Jesus answered : "Thou 
sayest that I am a king. To this 
end was I born, and for this cause 
came I into the world, that I should 
bear witness unto the truth." In 
that sense truth applies to the gos- 
pel, the power of God unto salvation 
to all those who accept it, and Christ 
bore testimony to that truth. You 
and I today bear the same testi- 
mony, bear testimony by word of 
mouth that God has spoken to His 
sons and daughters, and restored to 
them the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
There is another way that Christ 
bore witness to that truth, and that 
was in His life. Men have called 
Him an enthusiast ; they have ac- 
cused Him of being a dreamer, an 
ascetic, a recluse, and other such 
epithets have they hurled at Him, 
but they are loath ever to say that 
Christ, the Redeemer, was dishonest 
or untrue. His life is a life of hon- 
esty, honor, uprightness. He was 
drawn to men who were honest 
themselves, whose hearts were pure 
and guileless. Witness how quick- 
ly He saw purity and guilelessness 
in Nathaniel. "Behold," said He, 
"an Israelite, indeed, in whom there 
is no guile." As a negative pole is 
drawn by the positive, the mutual 
attraction seemed to be here. Their 
souls attracted each other, as the 



dewdrop trickling down the flower, 
in the morning, falls into its brother 
dewdrop on the flower, absorbed in 
one whole. So the purity of Christ 
seemed to absorb, attract, draw to 
the purity of Nathaniel. Nathaniel 
was honest, upright, pure, as a fol- 
lower of Christ should be. No guile- 
less man can be dishonest. No guile- 
less man can stoop to chicanery and 
fraud, deceiving a brother. I say 
Christ's life and His teachings al- 
ways bore testimony to the truth. In 
our day, God has said, through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith : "God does 
not walk in crooked paths, neither 
does He vary to the right hand or to 
the left. His words are true always,, 
never varying from the straight 
path, and His words have one eter- 
nal round." To the Latter-day 
Saints, as God's people, he has de- 
clared that one of the fundamental 
principles of their belief is honesty 
and truthfulness. I rejoice in re- 
peating our thirteenth article of 
faith. 

"We believe in being honest, true,, 
chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in do- 
ing good to all men. Indeed, we may 
say that we follow the admonition of 
Paul. We believe all things; we hope 
all things ; we have endured many things, 
and hope to be able to endure all things. 
If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or 
of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek 
after these things." 

Let your light so shine among 
men that they seeing your good 
works may be led to glorify our 
Father which is in heaven. In prob- 
ably no more effective way can the 
truth be witnessed before men than 
for every Latter-day Saint to main- 
tain and foster the confidence of our 
outside friends in a faithful mem- 
ber of the Church of Christ. Now r 
in order to do that we must be hon- 
est in all things. If we are contrac-

tors, and agree to put in such and 
such material in a building, let us 
put that material in. If we agree 
to the stipulations of a contract, to 
put in one hundred and fifty feet of 
radiation in the building, let us put 
in one hundred and fifty feet. Those 
are details, aren't they, but those are 
the details by which the men whom 
you deal with will judge your ac- 
tions. If we are taking to market 
potatoes of a particular grade, and 
we so describe that grade, let us 
know that an investigation will 
prove our statements true. I was 
grieved when I heard a wholesale 
dealer say that he has opened sacks 
of produce, brought in from the 
farm, and found foreign material, 
such as rocks and dirt, placed in to 
make up weight. I did not ask him 
for the religion of those men ; I 
asked for no name ; but such things 
are dishonorable, no true member 
of the Church of Christ can stoop 
to such trickery. Let your light 
shine before men. In this world to- 
day there needs to be an ensign, a 
people standing out in bold relief as 
an example to the world in honesty 
and fair-dealing. I will not con- 
demn the world, but to illustrate 
what I mean, I will let a reverend 
gentleman give his opinion of the 
world at large today. I quote from 
Mr. Jefferson, author of "The Char- 
acter of Jesus." Speaking of the 
insincerity of the world, he says : 

"And yet how common insincerity is. 
What a miserable old humbug of a world 
we are living in — full of trickery, and 
dishonesty, and deceit of every kind. So- 
ciety is cursed with affectation. Busi- 
ness is honey-combed with dishonesty. 
The political world abounds in duplicity 
and chicanery. There is sham, and pre- 
tense, and humbugery everywhere. Some 
use big words we do not understand, and 
some will claim to knowledge which they 
do not possess ; and some parade in 
dresses which they cannot pay for. The 



life of many a man and many a woman 
is one colossal lie. We say things which 
we do not mean; express emotions which 
we do not feel. We praise when we se- 
cretly condemn. We smile when there 
is a frown on the face of the heart. We 
give compliments when we are really 
thinking curses, striving a hundred times 
a week to make people think we are 
other than we are. It is a penitentiary 
offense to obtain money, under false pre- 
tenses ; and so from this we carefully 
refrain ; but how many other things are 
obtained, do you think, by shamming and 
pretending, for which there is no penalty 
but the condemnation of Almighty God. 
Yes, it is a sad, deceitful, demoralized 
world in the midst of which we find our- 
selves ; but, thank God, there are hearts, 
here and there, upon which we can ever 
more depend. We have tested them, and 
we know them to be true." 

Such hearts as he mentions at the 
last must be found everywhere in 
the Church of Christ, if we believe 
— not just think — "Believe" may not 
be so expressive as conviction or 
faith, but it is stronger than "think." 
When we say, "I believe I will do 
this," we do it ; I do it. We do not 
say, "I think the Bible is the word of 
God." We believe the Bible to be the 
word of God, and accept it as such ; 
and so when that article of faith is re- 
peated, "We believe in being honest, 
true — " we take it as part of our 
life, that our acts may so shine 
among men ; but there is one reason 
before, deeper than that, because it 
is right, the only way to live. Breth. 
ren and sisters, be honest in all your 
dealings. Be true to yourselves. 
Never be false to your honest con- 
victions. Be true to your brethren ; 
be true to the Church of Christ ; be 
true to the testimony you possess ; 
and then men must see by your good 
works that you do possess knowl- 
edge which they do not have. 

God help us in this and in all 
worthy things, to bear witness to the 
truth, in all the world, — I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The law of obedience. — Samuel and 
Saul. — Ingersoll's inconsistency. — 
Blasphemous presumption. — How 
blessings are obtained. — Abraham's 
example. — L/iving by every word. 
Will of the Lord in 1847.— "This is 
the Place." — How the Gentiles will 
capture Mormonism. — Celestial Law. 

Hath the Lord as great delight in 
burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in 
obeying the voice of the Lord? Be- 
hold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and 
to hearken than the fat of rams. 

The speaker was Samuel the 
prophet, and the one to whom he 
spoke was Saul, king of Israel. Saul 
had reecived a commission from 
God, through the prophet, to de- 
stroy the Amalekites, a wicked and 
corrupt people who had lain in wait 
for Israel when on their way to 
Canaan, in the days of Joshua ; and 
so strict was the commandment that 
Saul was required to spare no liv- 
ing soul, nor cattle, nor sheep, nor 
anything pertaining to that nation. 
But he deviated from the command- 
ment of God; made himself the 
judge of which part of it he should 
obey, and which part he might ig- 
nore ; he spared Agag, the Amale- 
kite king, and brought him captive 
toward Jerusalem. He spared, al- 
so, the choicest of the cattle and 
the sheep, and thought to justify 
himself in his disobedience by mak- 
ing a great sacrifice to Jehovah. 

Meeting Samuel on the way, Saul 
was asked if he had carried out the 
Lord's command and replied in the 
affirmative. "Then what means this 
bleating of sheep and this lowing 
of cattle that I hear," inquired the 
prophet; and the king had to con- 
fess, to his shame, that he had not 
fully carried out the command, but 
had spared the wicked monarch 
and allowed himself to be persuad- 



ed by the people to take a spoil and 
return with it to offer a burnt offer- 
ing unto Jehovah. It was under 
these circumstances that Samuel ut- 
tered the words : 

Hath the Lord as great delight in 
burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in 
obeying the voice of the Lord? Be- 
hold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and 
to hearken than the fat of rams. 

I wonder if King Saul was pos- 
sessed of the same spirit that seems 
to imbue some men in these modern 
days. I have in mind a renowned 
agnostic, the late Robert G. Inger- 
soll, a wonderful man in some re- 
spects, a natural orator — magnetic, 
powerful in his influence over 
the people, brilliant in eloquence 
but shallow and unsafe in his 
reasonings. He took the ground 
that Jehovah was a murderer, 
because he commanded Joshua to 
exterminate the wicked races 
that encumbered the land of 
Canaan, and because Saul was re- 
quired to slay the Amalekites. In 
his writings he condemns Joshua 
for his obedience, and lauds Saul 
for showing compassion toward the 
wicked king and for disobeying 
God's command. Ingersoll also de- 
clared that Jehovah was a law- 
breaker, a violator of His own stat- 
utes because, forsooth, He had com- 
manded that "whosoever sheddeth 
man's blood, by man shall his blood 
be shed, and then had issued com- 
mandments requiring Joshua and 
Saul and others of His generals to 
destroy the wicked nations around 
them. 

I have not time to dwell upon this 
branch of my subject; but will say. 
in passing, that the Giver of life 
cannot commit murder by taking 
life, and it is the supreme height 
of impertinence and presumption 



ELDER ORSON 

for any man to accuse God of 
crime. Man cannot give life, and is 
therefore commanded to take no 
life ; but life can be taken by its Au- 
thor without committing sin. To 
execute a criminal is not murder. 
It is equally presumptuous to say 
that Jehovah, the great law-giver, 
is a law-breaker because He 
chooses, at any time, to revoke one 
command and supersede it by an- 
other ; to repeal one law and enact 
another in its stead. Colonel In- 
gersoll was a lawyer — what some 
would call a statesman — he knew 
that the legislature of any state or 
territory is entirely competent to 
enact new laws and repeal old ones ; 
and yet he had the blasphemous pre- 
sumption to accuse the all-wise and 
omnipotent Creator of breaking His 
own laws, because, having com- 
manded that no man should shed 
blood, He afterwards commanded 
certain men to kill. I wonder if 
Saul was possessed of the same 
idea. His offense seems to have 
been that he made himself the ar- 
biter and judge of the command- 
ment that he had received; deter- 
mining which part should be carried 
out, and which part he could dis- 
obey; an offense so serious, in the 
eyes of the Lord, that He rent the 
kingdom from Saul and gave it to 
another. 

It is not for man to sit in judg- 
ment upon the decrees of the Al- 
mighty. It is his duty to obey. We 
are told by the Prophet Joseph Smith 
that it is on the principle of obedi- 
ence that we receive all our bless- 
ings. "There is a law," he says, 
'"irrevocably decreed in heaven, be- 
fore the foundations of this world, 
upon which all blessings are predi- 
cated ; and when we obtain any 
blessing from God, it is by obedi- 



F. WHITNEY. 51 

ence to that law upon which it is 
predicated." 

The example of Abraham should 
have been sufficient for Saul. He 
was commanded to slay his son 
Isaac; and though it doubtless 
wrung his heart to make the sacri- 
fice, he was willing, and was about 
to make it, when he received, from 
the same source, another command 
suspending the former behest, and 
requiring of him that he lay not his 
hand upon the lad. Abraham would 
have carried out the first command- 
ment, had he not received the sec- 
ond. And had he been unwilling, 
he would have been a transgressor ; 
but, having received a command- 
ment not to do the thing that had 
been commanded, if he had gone on 
wilfully and disobeyed the later re- 
quirement, he would have been a 
transgressor. Nor would the Giver 
of those commandments have been 
inconsistent. "My word is my law, 
saith the Lord." He has a right to 
require one thing today and another 
thing tomorrow, and the latest word 
that comes from Him is the word 
that His people must obey. 

This is what it means to "live by 
every word that proceeds from the 
mouth of God." We cannot justify 
ourselves in living by that particu- 
lar part of the word that appeals 
to us, the part that we desire to obey, 
but must be willing to make sacri- 
fices. Sometimes the sacrifice 
is involved in the doing of a 
deed, and sometimes in leaving it 
undone. We do not take our com- 
mands from the Bible. We are not 
governed by the gospel as revealed 
to the Nephites. We are living in 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, and have a right to receive 
divine revelation, here and now, and 
this is our guide, our law, and we 
must be governed thereby. No man 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



can stand up today in this Church 
and justify himself in any course 
by pleading what the Nephites did, 
or what the Jews did or did not do. 
The vital question with us is : What 
does God require of the Latter-day 
Saints? We have as much right to 
the word of the Lord as had the Ne- 
phites, the Jews, or the early Chris- 
tians. If this is not true, Mor- 
monism is a sham and is not what 
it claims to be. 

In the month of January, 1847, 
the Latter-day Saints were en- 
camped upon the banks of the Mis- 
souri river. They had been ex- 
pelled from the State of Illinois, 
and a band of pioneers was being 
selected for the journey across the 
plains to the Rocky Mountains. The 
word and will of the Lord was giv- 
en through President Brigham 
Young, commanding the people to 
organize themselves into companies, 
with captains of hundreds, and fif- 
ties, and tens, preparatory to their 
journey to the West. That was 
the word of the Lord to our par- 
ents and grand-parents. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith had predicted 
that the Latter-day Saints would be 
driven westward and become a 
mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains, and President 
Young, as his successor ana ex- 
ecutor, gave that word and will of 
the Lord at Winter Quarters, but is 
it the word and will of the Lord to 
you and to me? Are we to hitch 
up ox-teams, in this day of rail- 
roads and automobiles and aero- 
planes, and go wandering off to Cal- 
ifornia, or to Mexico, or to Canada, 
and justify ourselves by pointing 
to the word of the Lord given in 
January, 1847, upon the banks of 
the Missouri? Why no; the fal- 
lacy is apparent at a glance. 

This is the place selected by the 
God of heaven, where His people 



should remain and become mighty. 
President Young declared that he 
beheld Salt Lake Valley in vision 
while on the way hither; he saw a 
tent "settling down from heaven," 
resting over this spot, while a voice 
from above declared, "This is the 
place where my people Israel shall 
pitch their tents." 

And, remember, the Prophet Jo- 
seph had declared that this people 
should become mighty — not in Mex- 
ico, not in Canada, not on the Pa- 
cific coast; but "'in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains." You all know, 
if you are familiar with history, 
of the efforts made to induce Pres- 
ident Young to deviate from the 
course indicated by that prediction. 
Samuel Brannan, who had rounded 
Cape Horn with a Mormon colony, 
and landed on the shore of Cali- 
fornia, met the pioneers on Green 
river and tried to induce them to 
change their purpose and plant their 
colony on the fertile slopes of the 
Pacific. Brigham Young answered, 
"No ; this is the place ; here we will 
build the city and temple of our 
God." Bridger, Harris, and other 
mountaineers thought to discourage 
him, telling him that grain r could not 
be raised in the Great Basin ; but 
he turned a deaf ear to their state- 
ments. He had seen this valley ; 
had seen a great city rising here 
from the barren sands* and he knew 
more than Colonel Bridger, or Sam- 
uel Brannan ; for he was guided by 
the inspiration of heaven. 

Here the Latter-day Saints will 
remain, it is my belief, until they 
go down, in the might of Israel's 
God, to take possession of the 
Promised Land; their next general 
movement will be eastward, not 
westward, from the Rocky Moun- 
tains. Oh, but the Gentiles are com- 
ing in overwhelming numbers to 
outvote us, to snow us under! Well, 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



53 



what if they do? If the Gentiles 
come to us, it will save us the trou- 
ble of going" to them. Our mission 
is to the Gentiles — not from them ; 
and if they come, we will not skulk 
and run away, but face about and 
extend the olive branch, preach 
the gospel to them, and save their 
souls, if we can ; for that is our mis- 
sion. I want to see the Gentiles 
capture Mormonism. The Romans 
conquered Greece, and were con- 
quered, in the doing of it, by Greec- 
ian culture, learning, and civiliza- 
tion ; and the Romans were con- 
quered by the Barbarians who, in 
turn, were subjected to the Pope of 
Rome and became Christians. If 
the Gentiles capture Mormonism, it 
will make Mormons of them — and 
that is just what we want. We 
want all the good Gentiles we can 
get, and we do not care how many 
of them come and embrace the gos- 
pel. Talk about the Gentiles over- 
whelming the Mormons and de- 
stroying the work of God ! Yes, 
just as the Romans destroyed the 
Jews and the Christians. I can go 
out upon the street today and find 
a Jew ; I can go out and meet a 
Christian; but has any one seen a 
Roman of late? The Romans be- 
came Christians, and the Gentiles, 
tens of thousands of them, perhaps 
millions, will become Latter-day 
Saints and will help build up the 
kingdom of God. That is my faith 
in this work, and my confidence in 
the Gentiles, and in the word of the 
Lord concerning them upon this 
land. 

We receive all our blessings up- 
on the principle of obedience. There 
is a celestial law, a terrestrial law, 
and a telestial law ; and we can at- 
tain to any degree of glory that we 
desire, but it will be upon the prin- 
ciple of obedience. If we obey ce- 



estial law, we will obtain celestial 
glory. If we obtain terrestrial glory, 
it will be by obedience to terrestrial 
law ; and the same with telestial law 
and telestial glory. And what is 
celestial law? It does not mean 
any one thing; it means all things. 
It is the fullness of obedience : it is 
living by every word that proceeds 
from the mouth of God. If today, 
you are keeping those command- 
ments that are now in force, you 
are living a celestial law, and your 
chances are good for celestial glory. 
Amen. 

Sister Esther Davis sang a so- 
prano solo, entitled "A Prayer." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

The immense attendance at Conference 
evinces devotion to religion. — Presi- 
dent Smith's example of faithfulness. 
Failure to live by law not evidence 
against its divinity. — To acquire true 
knowledge there must be no prejudice. 

I sense very keenly, my brethren 
and sisters and friends, the great 
responsibility resting upon me in 
undertaking to lead in thought this 
vast congregation. My only hope 
of being able to do it, with any de- 
gree of profit, is through the help 
and blessing of the Lord; and as 
we never know in advance just how 
much we are in favor with the Lord, 
and how much assistance He is go- 
ing to give us, we have great con- 
cern. Barring this great responsi- 
bility and anxiety, these conferences 
are a source of great joy and satis- 
faction, the present conference being 
no exception to the rule. The gen- 
eral authorities and the people have 
been offering earnest prayers to the 
Lord, for some weeks, that we 
might have with us, in the meet- 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ings of this conference, our beloved 
president, the mouthpiece and rep- 
resentative of the Lord unto His 
people. Had our petitions not been 
answered, we would have been 
greatly disappointed; but the Lord 
has again been kind to us, and has 
so far healed and strengthened 
President Smith that he has been 
able to be with us. His very pres- 
ence in the congregation of the 
saints is an inspiration, his testi- 
mony is soul-stirring, and his bene- 
diction upon us, as a people, makes 
our hearts to rejoice indeed. 

The effect of all the good talk, 
and the inspiration which accom- 
panies it, in the meetings of the con- 
ference is to make us feel that the 
gospel is indeed true. We some- 
times suffer lapses. Our time, to 
such a great extent, is devoted to 
the things of this world, the tem- 
poralities, that we become wedded 
to them and, naturally, that takes 
away our attention from the spir- 
itual things, those things which are 
of most importance unto us, and we 
become more or less weaned in our 
minds and feelings. It is refresh- 
ing to come to a conference where 
the Spirit of the Lord is manifest 
in such great power, where such 
powerful testimonies are borne, 
where the truths of the everlasting 
gospel are made so plain to our un- 
derstanding, and where we are 
made to feel the truth of the work 
in which we are engaged; and so 
we rejoice together. I rejoice, too, 
in meeting so many of the saints 
from various parts of this great 
country where our people are set- 
tled, from Canada to Mexico, up 
and down the country. We find a 
good attendance of representative 
men and women, and a great gath- 
ering of the saints, which makes 
this a largely attended conference. 



I rejoice to meet them whether it be 
upon the street, in their homes, or 
wherever I have the opportunity. 
It reminds me of their faithfulness, 
of the great labor they are accom- 
plishing in Israel. So with these re- 
turned missionaries, and the presi- 
dents of our missions ; I am glad to 
meet them, to shake their hands and 
be reminded of the many men and 
women who are in the world repre- 
senting the truth today, the great 
sacrifices which are being made by 
the people, sacrifices of time, of 
money, and of effort for the fur- 
therance of this work. I love the 
people for their devotion and faith- 
fulness. I love to look them in the 
face. I love to shake their hands 
and to know that they fellowship 
me, that I have fellowship and 
standing with them. 

At the close of the first session of 
this conference, in conversation 
with one of our brethren he made 
this remark : "There are but few 
persons who could bear such a testi- 
mony as has been borne to us, this 
morning, by our president," refer- 
ring particularly to the remarks 
made by President Smith respect- 
ing himself. I said, in answer, 
"Perhaps there are but few who 
have made their lives to conform 
as closely to the gospel law as has 
our dear President," to which he 
assented. I am reminded of the 
word of the Lord, in a revelation 
to the Prophet Joseph, wherein He 
said : "There is a law, irrevocably 
decreed in heaven, before the foun- 
dations of this world, upon which 
all blessings are predicated ; and 
when we obtain any blessing from 
God, it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." So, 
my brethren and sisters, if you will 
yield the same obedience, the same 
devotion and zeal to the gospel, to 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



55 



its laws and requirements, and the 
building up of the kingdom, mani- 
festing the same faithfulness as our 
venerated president has, we will, 
perhaps, enjoy the same testimony, 
in the same strength and power, 
and be able to refer to our lives 
with the same satisfaction. We can 
then, with pleasure and pride, point 
to our life's history as being- above 
reproach. The gospel is intended 
to make us like our Savior, for He 
was the great prototype and ex- 
emplar, to bring us back into His 
presence, heirs with Him in the 
blessings and glories of our Fath- 
er's kingdom. We have the history 
of His life before us, and we are 
requested and required, by the gos- 
pel, to follow in his foot steps. We 
have His representative before us 
in our midst, and we would do well 
to look to him, and emulate the 
good example which he sets before 
this Church. So with all these gen- 
eral authorities, for as they have 
taken upon them the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, to be witnesses 
for Him, I believe that every one 
of them ought to be exemplars be- 
fore the people, their lives, their 
example should be worthy the emu- 
lation of the people in the Church, 
or out of the Church. Then, indeed, 
would our light so shine that others 
seeing our good works would glori- 
fy our Father which is in heaven. 

It is not that the gospel law is 
weak, or defective, or changeable, 
that the lives of those who profess 
to be saints of God are not always 
in strict harmony therewith. It 
must be remembered that, while the 
law is divine and perfect, and while 
those who have yielded to it are 
trying to reach the goal of perfec- 
tion, yet they are more or less weak. 
There are those among us and of 
us whose faith is weak, and those 



who are not of us ought to take this 
into account. No matter what some 
of the people, or one in authority, 
may say or do, it cannot possibly 
render the truth a lie, or prove any 
ordinance of the gospel unnecessary 
to the salvation of the children of 
men. We admit that our lives 
should conform perfectly to the law 
of the gospel. Now, while those 
who are without look upon us in 
this way, and while the Lord evi- 
dently realized that this would be 
the case, the Savior having in mind 
that fact, when He said that we 
should let our light so shine that 
others seeing our good works would 
glorify our Father in heaven ; rea- 
lizing that men would judge the 
faith we represent, or the cause we 
represent by our conduct, we would 
warn those who are without that 
this may not always be a safe rule 
to go by, because of the weaknesses 
of men. But the law is perfect, and 
we invite all to an investigation 
thereof. The evidences are ample 
to prove that the law and doctrines 
taught by the Latter-day Saints to- 
day are the same as those which 
were taught by the Savior and His 
apostles and the saints in the prim- 
itive church. Concerning this we 
have an abundance of scriptural evi- 
dence. Reason also will teach us 
and appeal to us, and then, by the 
power of the Holy Spirit, which we 
receive by yielding obedience to the 
law which comes to us, by our ask- 
ing, knocking, and seeking, we shall 
receive the complete testimony, and 
we will not be in doubt. 

My testimony to you is, as it has 
been before, to the members of the 
Church, and to those who are with- 
out, that this work is true, and that 
you may "know it is true. But, you 
must rid yourselves of that preju- 
dice which may have come to you 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



through false education, through 
misrepresentation of this people and 
of the authority which they hold, of 
the cause which they have espoused, 
— you must rid yourself of this pre- 
judice in order that, for your souls' 
salvation sake, you may be able to 
consider and render a righteous de- 
cision on the things which you may 
investigate. It would be folly for a 
man to come into our midst and try 
to find out all that he could about 
us as a people, and about what we 
believe in, with a view to tearing 
down and belittling the work of the 
Lord, and the people of the Lord, 
and then hope that by that means 
he would know whether or not the 
work is true. There is no possibil- 
ity of true knowledge being ac- 
quired by such investigation ; in 
fact, the individual being biased dis- 
qualifies himself to render a right- 
eous decision. If we were impan- 
eling a jury to sit on a case, I fancy 
the first question asked of those 
who were summoned, would be, 
""Are you prejudiced in this case?" 
And, if the answer were in the af- 
firmative, the individual would be 
excused, as being disqualified to 
render a just decision. Those who 
are not of us should remember that 
they are their own jury; thev are 
to hear and to decide the case, judg- 
ing from the evidence which shall 
be presented to them ; by that evi- 
dence, and by their course of life, 
will they be judged in the last day. 
So, if possible, this prejudice must 
be broken down first, and in order 
that it may be broken down, I offer 
a suggestion to those who are thus 
prejudiced. We have an example, 
an illustration of this prejudice, and 
what it led to, in the case of Saul of 
Tarsus, who was afterwards known 
as Paul the apostle to the Gentiles. 
You know his history; you know 



of his persecuting the saints, and 
how that on one occasion he held 
the clothes of those who stoned to 
death one of the servants of the 
Lord, Stephen. He was on his way 
to Damascus to bind men and wom- 
en that he might take them and 
cast them into dungeons. When 
on the way he was confronted by an 
angel in a light from heaven, and 
he was stricken blind. You know 
the story and what followed, that 
when Paul became convinced of the 
error of his way, of his mistaken 
judgment and prejudices, — he being 
honest, as he declares that all he did 
was done conscientiously, thinking 
that he was doing God service — 
he became one of the most valiant 
in the cause. Now, in the case of 
those who fight against Zion, those 
who are maligning this people, must 
it needs be that the Lord shall send 
an angel to each one, that he may be 
convinced of his error? or does not 
the Lord expect that they will profit 
by the experience of Saul? I be- 
lieve that is what the Lord expects. 
If it was possible for Paul, who was 
educated under Gamaliel, to be thus 
deceived and mistaken in persecut- 
ing the saints of God, may it not be 
possible, friends, that some of you 
who are using your influence 
against this people, and this work, 
are also mistaken ? Now if you can 
rid yourselves of prejudice and con- 
sider these things, I am sure that 
the evidence will be ample to con- 
vince you of the truth of Mormon- 
ism, so-called. 

I rejoice in the testimony of this 
work, which the Lord has given to 
me in common with you, my breth- 
ren and sisters ; for I do know that 
the work is true. And, as I know 
that the work is true, and the power 
of God unto salvation, I know that 
the humble instruments in the hands

•of the Lord, in revealing this work 
were divinely called; and theirs has 
been a divine mission, the Prophet 
Joseph and Brigham, and those who 
have been our leaders down to the 
present time. I know that the Lord 
is with this people today, that He 
does honor His authority, that He 
will magnify it in the earth ; and 
this work will grow and spread 
abroad until truth shall cover the 
face of the whole earth, as the wa- 
ters cover the mighty deep. I know 
that this Church and kingdom is 
the Church and kingdom of God. 
The prophecies shall be fulfilled, 
and Christ our Lord shall come 



and possess the kingdom, He shall 
reign as Lord of Lords and King 
of Kings forever. This is my testi- 
mony, which I bear to you, in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing; 

Fill our hearts with joy and peace; 
Let us each, Thy love possessing, 

Triumph in redeeming grace. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Sunday, Oct. 9th. 



THIRD DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, Oct. 
9th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith, and he 
announced that an overflow meet- 
ing will now be convened in the 
Assembly Hall, under direction of 
Elder Anthony W. Ivins, for the 
benefit of the many who can not be 
accommodated in the overcrowded 
Tabernacle. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

An angel from on high. 

The long, long silence broke ; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words he spoke : 

Lo ! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 

A sacred record lies concealed. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ju- 
nius F. Wells. 

A selection entitled ''Roses and 
Lillies," was rendered by twelve 
young lady members of the choir. 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

One Spirit characterizes Saints in all 
countries. — Divine authority lacking 
in sects of Christendom. — Evidences 
of Divine authority conferred upon 
Latter-day Saints. — Ordinances per- 
formed under Divine authority eter- 
nal in effect. — Ordinances performed 
without authorized appointment not 
valid. 

It is now four years since I had 
the pleasure of attending a General 
Conference, of looking upon the 
faces of my brethren and sisters, 
and listening to the instructions of 
our leaders. My heart is filled with 



gratitude, this morning, for the priv- 
ilege that I now enjoy. This is a 
glorious sight, to me, to see this vast 
body of Latter-day Saints, gathered 
from different quarters of the earth, 
assembled here to worship God "in 
the beauty of holiness," with minds 
open to receive the truth, with a 
desire to learn the ways of the 
Lord and to have strength to walk 
therein. I do not think such a spec- 
tacle as I look upon today can be 
seen anywhere else among all the 
nations of the earth. 

While I have been absent I have 
traveled a great deal among the 
countries of Europe, have visited all 
parts of the British Isles — England. 
Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. (I 
will say, in passing, for the benefit 
of our Welsh brethren, that the 
work has been re-opened in that 
Principality, and in South Wales we 
have several missionaries and a 
number of converts to the truth. ) I 
also visited Holland and Belgium. 
Switzerland and many parts of Ger- 
many, also Sweden, Denmark, and 
Norway. In all my travels, when 
I have found bodies of Latter-day 
Saints, I have felt the same spirit 
among them as I have felt during 
this conference in tliis tabernacle. 
The Latter-day Saints, wherever 
they are found, are "baptized by 
one spirit into one body," no matter 
what their race or nationality, no 
matter what may have been their 
religion formerly. They have come 
out from the world, and have been 
"baptized into Christ ;" they are a 
part of the body of Christ. His. 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



Spirit is with them, and they re- 
joice in the knowledge of the truth. 
They have followed the injunction 
of the ancient apostle, "Add to your 
faith knowledge," etc. God has 
given them a witness by the power 
of the Holy Ghost, and they have 
received the truth as it has come 
from Him in this age of the world. 

There are a great many people 
among the various Christian denom- 
inations, who have faith, but there 
is very little real knowledge of the 
truth. There are many learned pro- 
fessors and teachers of theology, 
many great orators, men blest of 
God with the gift of speech, and it 
is beautiful to hear their finely 
rounded sentences. Their eloquence 
is charming, but there is one thing 
which they all lack — every sect, 
every denomination, every section or 
faction of Christendom is lacking 
the power of God to administer in 
His holy name by authority. This 
is a matter of the very greatest im- 
portance. While every man and 
every woman should have the priv- 
ilege of expressing their belief, of 
conveying their ideas in regard to 
religion, as well as to philosophy 
and to science, and anything and 
everything which will upbuild hu- 
manity, while they should have this 
freedom everywhere, and people 
should be willing to listen to their 
voices when they are able to convey 
any principle of truth, they lack 
that divine authority which God gave 
to His servants in ancient times and 
which, I am pleased to know, He 
has restored in the day and age in 
which we live. It is one thing to 
preach the doctrine that Jes as is the 
Christ, and another thing to be 
authorized to administer in His 
name. There are millions of peo- 
ple who do not seem to understand 
this distinction — that men may 



preach and lecture, and may write 
and deliver essays on religious sub- 
jects, but that does not give them 
any right whatever to administer or- 
dinances that God has instituted, in 
His holy name. 

When Jesus Christ sent His apos- 
tles out to preach the gospel to all 
the world, to every creature, He 
gave them authority to administer in 
the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. They 
received a witness from God that 
they were endowed with this author- 
ity and power. Jesus, the Son, spoke 
in the name of the Father, and the 
Holy Ghost was sent upon them to 
witness to their souls that they 
were thus authorized. Christ him- 
self, we are told, did not "glorify 
himself to be made a High Priest, 
but He who said unto Him, Thou 
art my Son this day have I begot- 
ten thee and called thee to be a 
Priest forever, after the order of 
Melchizedek." Christ said to His 
apostles whom He chose to repre- 
sent Him in the world : "As my 
Father sent me, even so send I you. 
Whosesoever sins ye remit, they 
are remitted unto them and whose- 
soever sins ye retain, they are re- 
tained." "Whatsoever you shall 
seal or bind on earth shall be sealed 
or bound in heaven and that which 
you loose on earth shall be loosed 
in heaven." This is very great au- 
thority ; this is divine power ; this 
is priesthood. The holy priesthood 
is divine authority, as the Holy 
Spirit is divine light ; and the ser- 
vants of the Lord, sent out by our 
Savior in former times, as we read 
in the New Testament, were en- 
dowed with this authority and 
clothed upon with this light. They 
were instructed by the Savior how 
this power should be used. All the 
teachings of the Savior in regard to 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this matter are not recorded in the 
New Testament, nor in any other 
book that I have learned about ; but 
He did converse with them and ex- 
plain to them how this power should 
be exercised, its limits, and the ex- 
tent of the authority. After His 
resurrection, we are told, He was 
with them about forty days. The 
record of His teachings to His 
apostles, and those associated with 
them in this holy ministry was not 
preserved, so far as we know. If 
these teachings were ever recorded 
they will be brought forth in these 
last days, in this great "dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times, in the 
which the Lord will gather together 
in one all things that are in Christ, 
both in the heavens and on the 
earth." These things are not now 
in our possession ; so far as we 
know they are not on record ; but 
we can readily understand, from the 
actions and teachings of the apos- 
tles, that they were not only clothed 
with this authority, but they re- 
ceived instructions how it should be 
exercised, limited, and extended. He 
established His Church and be- 
stowed these powers : 

"For the perfecting of the saints, for 
the work of the ministry, for the edify- 
ing of the body of Christ: 

"Till we all come in the unitv of the 
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son 
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the 
measure of the stature of the fulness 
of Christ: 

"That we henceforth be no more 
children, tossed to and fro, and carried 
about 'with every wind of doctrine, by 
the sleight of men, and cunning crafti- 
ness, whereby they lie in wait to de- 
ceive 

"But speaking the truth in love, may 
grow uo into him in all things, which 
is the head, even Christ." 

So Paul informs us in the fourth 
chapter of his epistle to the Ephe- 
sians. Now, this power and author- 



ity was recognized in heaven ; there 
is the force and the beauty and effi- 
cacy thereof. When one of these 
servants of God, ordained by the 
Savior, or ordained by the apostles 
or others who were ordained by the 
Savior, administered in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, or, as it is 
in the case of baptism and one or 
two other ordinances, in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Ghost, their actions were 
recognized in the heavens. They 
were just as valid as though per- 
formed by Jesus Christ himself or 
by the Father who sent Him. There 
is the power, and strength, and 
majesty of this priesthood or divine 
authority; that whatsoever is prop- 
erly done by a man authorized of 
God, duly appointed and ordained 
to his office and calling, is registered 
on high and recognized there, and 
is of force and effect in the heavens 
as well as on the earth. 

This authority remained in the 
Church during its early period, but 
for hundreds of years, according to 
the confessions of modern Christian 
denominations, there has been no 
such power in the earth. All the 
Protestant denominations of Chris- 
tendom repudiate the idea that it 
has been handed down by continu- 
ity and by succession from the days 
of the apostles. In fact there is 
no church and has been no church, 
whether in Protestantism or in the 
older denomination or organization, 
in which there was an inspired 
apostle, a living prophet, a seer, a 
revelator, a man clothed upon with 
the authority which Christ gave to 
His ancient apostles. This is the 
great lack in all Christendom. We 
admire the eloquence of great Chris- 
tian preachers ; we admire the pur- 
itv of the lives of a great many 
Christian people ; we delight in the

music that they have composed ; we 
love the poetry which they have 
written, and we very often quote it. 
We recognize their songs, their 
music, their sculpture, their paint- 
ings, their art and science, and their 
great mechanical and other works 
for the benefit of humanity ; but, at 
the same time, we recognize this 
potent fact — that among them there 
has not been, for many centuries, 
any authority whatever from God 
to man to administer ordinances in 
His name. Therefore, their bap- 
tims, their confirmations and other 
ordinances which are administered 
in the various Christian churches, 
while they may be good things to 
bring people together in various or- 
ganizations, in unity, in concord 
and brotherly love, which exist to 
some extent, they are not recog- 
nized in the heavens, because God 
has not appointed them. Why 
should they be recognized above 
when, according to their own con- 
fessions, there has been no com- 
munication from God, from the 
Father, from the Son, firom the 
Holy Ghost, since the days of the 
early apostles ; that all these things 
are done away with and are not 
needed, even in these times. Now, 
since the Lord has not appointed 
them, since He has not given the 
authority that is exercised among 
these various conflicting sects, why 
should He accept of their offer- 
ings ? 

I would like to read a few verses 
of scripture to you, this morning, 
on this subject. You will find them 
in the one hundred and thirty- 
second section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. Perhaps this may not 
be recognized as scripture, by all of 
my hearers, but the Latter-day 
Saints regard the revelations of 
God in the latter days as of at least 



as much importance as anything 
that He revealed in former days. 
We accept the Bible as containing 
revelations from God in former 
days ; we also accept the Book of 
Mormon as containing the word of 
God to the people on this Ameri- 
can continent. But in the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants we have 
a number of revelations, given from 
the same source, from the same 
power, by the same gift, in this 
age, to men endowed with similar 
authority to that which was held by 
the ancients, and, therefore, we 
look upon the sayings in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants as scripture. 
I will read two or three verses from 
this section : 

"Behold! mine house is a house of 
order, saith the Lord God, and not a 
house of confusion. 

"Will I accept of an offerino-. saith 
the Lord, that is not made in my 
name! 

"Or, will I receive at vour hands 
that which I have not appointed! 

"And will I appoint unto you, saith 
the Lord, except it be by law, even as 
T and my Father ordained unto you, 
before the world was! 

"I am the Lord thy God, and I give 
unto you this commandment, that no 
man shall come unto the Father but 
by me, or by my word, which Is my 
law, saith the Lord 

"And everything that is in the world, 
whether it be ordained of men, by 
thrones or principalities, or powers, or 
things of name, whatsoever thev mav 
be, that are not by me, or by my word, 
saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, 
and shall not remain after men are 
dead, neither in nor after the resurrec- 
tion, saith the Lord your God 

"For whatsoever things remain are 
by me and whatsoever thines are not 
by me, shall be shaken and destroyed." 

There is a great deal more at- 
tached to this that I do not wish to 
refer to here, this morning: it is 
this holy power and authority that 
I wish to direct the attention of this 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



congregation to. Why should the 
Lord accept the offerings of men — 
their ordinances, their institutions, 
that which they have originated by 
human wisdom ? Would any gov- 
ernment on the earth recognize the 
acts of men who were not appoint- 
ed by that government? Would 
any corporation, or firm, or indi- 
vidual engaged in business, rec- 
ognize the acts of pretended agents 
who had received no authority from 
that person, or firm, or corpora- 
tion? When we read the holy 
scriptures that were written of old 
and given to the Hebrews, we find 
that from the beginning the Lord 
called certain individuals to act in 
His name, and that what they did 
by His authority He recognized, but 
that which was performed by per- 
sons who had not that authority He 
did not receive. They had no force, 
or virtue, or effect in the eternal 
world, and according to the revela- 
tion that I have just read, they will 
have no effect in and after the re- 
surrection from the dead. 

One very important thing con- 
nected with this, to the Latter-day 
Saints, is that the ordinance of 
marriage for eternity was revealed 
of the Lord, in this age of the 
world, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, by which men and women 
who had received the gospel, re- 
pented of their sins, been baptized 
for the remission of sins, and re- 
ceived the Holy Ghost by the lay- 
ing on of hands, could be sealed for 
time and eternity, according to the 
holy order of God, instituted in the 
beginning, when God gave Eve to 
Adam before they became mortal 
through transgression. This is an 
important ordinance pertaining to 
the salvation of mankind, and it 
opens up a field for thought which 
is very gratifying. It gladdens the 



heart, removes darkness from the 
mind, enables us to look upon 
things from an eternal standpoint : 
That though death may come and 
separate a man and his wife, yet, 
if they have been sealed by the holy 
ordinance that the Lord has insti- 
tuted, for time and for eternity, 
their union shall continue in and 
after the resurrection from the 
dead. Adam and Eve shall come 
together at the head of "a multi- 
tude, quickened and 'raised from 
the dead ;" and others who are blest 
with the same ordinance and priv- 
ilege, and have been sealed by the 
authority of this holy priesthood 
that God has restored, will come to- 
gether in the resurrection and will 
be husband and wife, and have their 
children gathered around them, if 
these children have walked in the 
right path, for the beginning of 
their kingdom and glory in worlds 
without end. Now, this ordinance, 
like all that the Lord has revealed, 
when solemnized, must be adminis- 
tered by authority. If it is done 
in the name of lesus Christ, and 
He has not authorized it, it is void. 
If it is done in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost, and they have not au- 
thorized it, it comes to an end and 
will have no virtue or effect in the 
world to come, nor in the heavens 
today. This should be understood 
by the Latter-day Saints, and no 
man should take upon himself au- 
thority that has not been conferred 
upon him, whether he be in the 
Church or out of the Church. 

The world, as I have said, has 
been destitute of this authority for 
hundreds of years. Thank God 
there is a way opened by the reve- 
lations of the Almighty by which 
salvation will come to millions and 
millions of people, both heathens

and Christians, who had not an op- 
portunity of obeying the truth in 
their day. The work will be per- 
formed for them by their posterity, 
and salvation will come to all who 
are worthy of it. It will come 
through the atonement wrought out 
by Jesus Christ, and in accordance 
with the plans that He has revealed, 
so that all things shall be done by 
His authority, by the authority of 
the heavens, and what is done on 
the earth, by that competent au- 
thority, will be recognized on high. 
I bear you my testimony that this 
power and authority has been re- 
stored in the day and age in which 
we live. I add my testimony to 
that of my brethren who have ex- 
plained, in this conference, how the 
holy priesthood was restored, how 
that men who held it anciently came 
and ordained Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery. First of all, the 
priesthood that John the Baptist 
held was conferred upon them, and 
afterwards the divine authority 
held by Peter, and James, and John, 
who stood at the head of the dis- 
pensation after Christ left the earth. 
We have been told how they came 
and bestowed the keys of their au- 
thority upon these men, and how it 
has been handed down to the pres- 
ent day. Our testimony is not only 
that Joseph Smith received this di- 
vine authority, in the only way by 
which it could be properly re- 
stored, but that those who have suc- 
ceeded him in this ministry have 
held the same keys of power and 
authority, right down to the pres- 
ent day. God has given us the 
assurance, (gave it to us in the be- 
ginning of this work,) that this 
Church and kingdom that He had 
organized should not pass away; 
it should not be overcome by the 
Avorld. by the influence and powers 



of men, but that it should stand and 
remain until everything beneath the 
eternal heavens should be brought 
in subjection, willingly, to the law 
of God, and every knee bow, and 
every tongue confess that Jesus is 
the Christ, to the glory of God the 
Father. I know that this is true. 
I bear you my testimony before this 
congregation and before the heav- 
ens, that the Lord has restored this 
divine authority to the earth, that 
it is in this Church and kingdom, 
and that the man who stands as its 
president holds the keys thereof. 

I warn my friends, my brethren, 
never to attempt to administer in 
anything to which they are not ap- 
pointed, for if they do they will not 
only find that what they have done 
is void, but that they will be found 
in transgression. It is a fearful 
thing to take upon us authority that 
the Lord has not restored. I would 
never attempt to go down into the 
waters of baptism and administer 
that ordinance to any individual, if 
I was not assured beyond any doubt 
whatever that I held the authority 
to say: "Having been commis- 
sioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize 
you in the name of the Father, and 
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." 
And no man has a right to use those 
sacred names or to act in that di- 
vine authority unless he has re- 
ceived it in the proper way. God's 
house is a house of order and not a 
house of confusion, and He will not 
accept an offering, or an ordinance, 
or an appointment that He has not 
established and authorized by His 
word, which is His law, through 
those that hold the keys; and there 
is, according to this revelation, but 
one man at a time, on the earth, 
that holds the keys of that sealing 
power. Now, let us remember this, 
my brethren and sisters, and let us, 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



while we look upon the world as 
stepping out of the proper line of 
conduct in performing ordinances 
to administer which they have not 
been appointed, let us be careful 
that we do not step out of the nar- 
row way and go into by and for- 
bidden paths. 

I testify to you that I know this 
work is God's work ; I know it will 
prevail ; I know it contains the ever- 
lasting truth of Almighty God. I 
know that the Lord loves that which 
is true, and good, and pure, and 
holy, and He cannot look upon sin 
with any degree of allowance, and, 
therefore, we must walk in His 
ways, keep His commandments, 
and be honorable, upright, and 
truthful in every respect. We must 
keep within our own lines : A deac- 
on or a teacher has not the right 
to baptize or to lay on hands for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost. The Lord 
has limited the authority in those 
two orders of the lesser priesthood 
to that which is revealed. In the 
very same way, no man has a right 
to administer in anything to which 
he has not been appointed. Let 
every man learn his duty and do it 
to the best of Instability. I bear 
testimony that the Spirit of God is 
poured out upon His people, every- 
where, where they keep His com- 
mandments. I have been up to the 
most northern point of Norway, 
away beyond the Arctic circle, and 
have met saints there possessed of 
the same spirit that I have found 
in England, and in Germany, and 
in other parts that I have men- 
tioned, and that are here today. I 
know that this is the work of God, 
and that His people rejoice before 
Him in a knowledge of the truth, 
for God has given them the wit- 
ness, to their souls, by the power 
and gift of the Holy Ghost; and 



He will give the same witness to all 
who earnestly and sincerely seek 
after Him and desire the truth. 

May God bless this congregation, 
all who are here, whether they be 
members of the Church or not. May 
our minds be open to receive the 
word of the Lord, given in ancient 
days or given in modern times ■ for 
the day is near at hand when light, 
and truth, and revelation will flow 
down from the skies, and that 
which we have already received are 
but droppings of the great shower 
to come. The Lord be praised for 
all His mercies. I thank Him, this 
morning, in my heart, for His good- 
ness to me. During the time that I 
have been absent, traveling almost 
continuously by land or by sea, I 
have been preserved from accident, 
from harm, from sickness, and from 
danger of every kind ; and in the 
midst of the congregation, I praise 
Him, this morning, with all my 
soul. I bear testimony that I know 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
the living God, that his successors 
have also been inspired by the Al- 
mighty, and that today we have a 
man at our head who holds the keys 
of the sealing power, with author- 
ity to direct in all the offices in the 
Church of Christ. 

I want to say, before I sit down, 
that I have met a great many of my 
"boys," as we call them, in the old 
world, who traveled in the ministry 
— good, faithful young men, and 
some older men, good and faithful 
servants of the Lord. Brethren, 
now we are at home let us keep on 
the harness ; don't let us go into the 
dark ; don't let us slacken our ef- 
forts, but let us be ardent and de- 
termined at all times and under all 
circumstances, in every position, to 
do our duty, to be clean and pure 
before the Lord, as we were when

we were on our missions. Let us 
serve the Lord with all our hearts, 
and keep our covenants, and seek 
to lead others in the right way. God 
help us all to do so — for Christ's 
sake. Amen. 

President Smith informed the 
congregation that the Assembly 
Hall, as well as the Tabernacle, is 
now overcrowded, and the multi- 
tude outside will be given an oppor- 
tunity to listen to speakers outdoors 
this afternoon, as a meeting will 
be arranged for that purpose, near 
the Bureau of Information build- 
ing, under direction of Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. 

"Life for Evermore," a baritone 
solo, was sung by Elder John Rob- 
inson.

Mormonism and its results. — How the 
truth has been misrepresented. — 
Faith and works. — How to meet the 
enemy. — Opposition strengthens the 
work of God. 

In an address put forth to the 
world, a few years ago, by the Pres- 
idency of the Church, are found 
these words : "Mormonism is in the 
world for the world's good." We be- 
lieve that is a true statement. If 
it be true that the world is better 
for having a good man live in it, 
then it must also be true that the 
world is better for Having multi- 
tudes of good men living in it. 
Mormonism has made better men 
out of multitudes of already good 
men, and has even made good men 
out of bad men; # but in all the his- 
tory of the church it has never made 
a bad man out of a good one, nor 
has it ever made men worse than 



they were before Mormonism found 
them. 

Notwithstanding this, Mormon- 
ism has met with a very persistent 
and bitter opposition from our so- 
called Christian friends. It can not 
be claimed, in truth, that we are 
not a sincere people, for insincerity 
has never produced and never can 
produce that which the Latter-day 
Saints have brought forth, mani- 
fested in part by their strength and 
power in the world. They cannot 
be accused of impiety, because they 
have manifested a devotion to God, 
and have kept His commandments, 
so far as they understood them, 
from the beginning. It cannot be 
successfully maintained that we love 
ignorance and are a degraded peo- 
ple, because we present to the world 
an example of intelligence, and 
among our people is found a spirit 
that yearns for knowledge and ed- 
ucation. It cannot be said in truth 
that the Latter-day Saints are in- 
dolent, because, wherever they 
dwell, by their industry and their 
intelligent enterprise they have re- 
deemed deserts and made them 
blossom and bloom with all that is 
beautiful, beneficial, and for the 
happiness of man. They have build- 
ed cities, towns, and villages, and 
filled the land with orchards, gar- 
dens, and farms. 

The Latter-day Saints have been 
misrepresented with respect to their 
home lives yet nowhere in the 
world can a people be found who 
love home more, who have builded 
more homes in proportion to their 
numbers, or who love their families 
more. We venerate the aged ; we 
are always ready and anxious to 
help the weak, and never has the 
cry of the widow or the orphan as- 
cended unto God against us. In 
our midst there can be found no 



66

poor to whose petition the Church 
has turned a deaf ear. Our religion 
is not a theory ; it is a fact. Ours 
is not a mere confession of faith ; 
it is a great profession with a splen- 
did practice. Ours is not a faith 
that is dead, being alone ; but a live, 
active faith, closely associated with 
a conscientious performance of good 
works. 

We have not hung our hope of 
salvation upon a single peg, nor do 
we rely for our salvation upon one 
word of scripture. We believe not 
only the Bible, as a compilation of 
sacred books, but we believe also 
in the very contents of these books ; 
and therein we differ greatly from 
our Christian neighbors. Those 
passages of scripture upon which 
they seem to rely most for their 
hope and salvation are: "Believe on 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou 
shalt be saved," "God so loved the 
world that He gave His only be- 
gotten Son, that whosoever should 
believe on Him should not perish 
but have everlasting life." These 
passages have formed a basis for 
most of the arguments that I have 
heard put forth by sectarian preach- 
ers, in their supposed defense of 
the Gospel of Christ. Now, we 
challenge the Christian world to 
believe in these passages of scrip- 
ture more honestly or earnestly 
than we do, but we have not en- 
tirely hung our hope of salvation 
upon them. We believe with equal 
earnestness in that other scripture 
containing these words of Christ : 
"Whosoever breaketh one of these 
least commandments, and teacheth 
men so, shall be counted the least 
in the kingdom of heaven ; but who- 
soever shall do and teach them the 
same shall be counted great in the 
kingdom of heaven." We also be- 
lieve in the scripture that says: 



He that heareth these sayings of 
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his 
house upon a rock. 

And the rain descended and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell not: 
for it was founded upon a rock. 

And every one that heareth these 
sayings of mine, and doeth them not. 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
which built his house upon the sand: 

And the rain descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell, and 
great was the fall of it. 

We believe that to attain eternal 
life a man must know the only true 
and living God and Jesus Christ 
whom He has sent. We believe 
that we must understand the doc- 
trines that He preached. We be- 
lieve that all who do the will of 
the Father shall know of the doc- 
trine. We believe that men must 
have faith in God, for without faith 
it is impossible to please God. We 
believe that a man must repent of 
his sins, because no unclean thing 
can enter the kingdom of heaven. 
We believe that men must be bap- 
tized by immersion for the remis- 
sion of their sins, in order that their 
sins may be washed away and they 
become clean in the sight of the 
Lord. We believe that men can only 
know the true and living God, and 
Jesus Christ whom He sent into 
the world, by the power and gift of 
the Holy Ghost. We believe that 
no man can receive that power and 
that gift except through faith, re- 
pentance, and baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins ; for no 
man can say, Jesus is the Christ, but 
by the Holy Ghost, and no man can 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
except it be conferred upon him by 
the laying on of hands of one hav- 
ing authority. 

Now, our sectarian friends may 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

continue their opposition and their 
warfare upon us. They may con- 
tinue to declare that Joseph Smith 
was an imposter, a false prophet, 
and that the Latter-day Saints are 
fanatics and dupes. They may con- 
tinue to misrepresent the doctrines 
of the Church, and declare that we 
prefer Joseph Smith to Jesus, our 
Redeemer. They may continue to 
say everything they have hereto- 
fore said ; but we have a very effec- 
tual way of meeting them and an- 
swering all such statements — and 
what is it ? They say that we dread, 
most of all, to be brought face to 
face with the Bible and its doctrines. 
The remarks of Brother Penrose 
this morning, in which he quoted ex- 
tensively from the scriptures, dis- 
prove that statement, as do the re- 
marks of all the brethren. We will 
go to the Bible for our defense 
against such methods, and will not 
answer railing with railing, nor 
slander with slander, but will en- 
deavor to put into practice the law 
of God, and love even our enemies. 
We will, first of all, pray for them. 
We cannot pray with much faith 
that so-called ministers who have 
taken the wrong course will repent 
for many of them have steeled their 
hearts against the truth and against 
repentance ; but we will pray — and 
with great faith, too — that the Lord 
will cause that they shall not blind 
the eyes of the innocent and those 
who love truth. We will pray that 
they may not have power to deceive 
the honest seeker after salvation, 
and with the Bible in our hands we 
will go out into their midst, into the 
very midst of their congregations, 
and with the power of the holy 
priesthood, which is the authority 
we hold, proclaim the gospel in all 
its purity, as contained in the scrip- 
tures, and by the power of the Holy 



Ghost bear testimony to the truth. 

We will continue to testify that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. 
We will continue ro testify that 
Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the 
world ; that He died for the sins of 
mankind ; that He came forth from 
the Father, begotten of God and 
born of woman ; that He grew to 
manhood ; that He preached the 
gospel of salvation, and was cruci- 
fied, after which He went into the 
spirit world and there proclaimed 
liberty to the captive, and opened 
the prison doors to them that were 
bound. He preached the gospel to 
the dead, that they might be judged 
according to men in the flesh, but 
live according to God in the spirit. 
We will preach that on the third 
day He arose from the dead, broke 
the bands of death, was the first 
fruits of the glorious resurrection ; 
and that after His resurrection He 
was among His disciples, teaching 
them, instructing them, opening the 
eyes of their understanding, and ex- 
pounding the words He had spoken 
unto them before His death. We 
will teach that His disciples beheld 
Him, that they beheld the wounds 
made in His crucifixion, and fur- 
ther that He declared, "All power 
is given unto me, both in heaven 
and in earth ; go ye, therefore, and 
teach all nations, baptizing them 
in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." 

We will declare these truths, and 
further proclaim that this same 
Christ came to Joseph Smith, the 
prophet, and that He sent Moroni 
an angel, a man who had lived and 
died, and was also raised from the 
dead ; and that he came and in- 
structed the prophet. We will tes- 
tify, also, that every man born into 
the world shall come forth in the 
resurrection, and shall take up the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



very body he laid down. We will 
declare the restoration of the gospel 
the establishment of the Church of, 
Christ, the committing of the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven unto men 
upon the earth ; and these things we 
will declare in words of soberness, 
by the power of the Holy Ghost; 
and by that means we will take 
away from them their congrega- 
tions, so that darkness shall flee 
away, light shall come, and mem- 
bers of their own churches stand 
up and declare to them, "All that 
thou hast taught us from the begin- 
ning is false, concerning the clos- 
ing of the heavens and the doing 
away of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, 
for there are apostles, and proph- 
ets, and evangelists and teachers,, 
and the gifts of healing, visions, 
revelation, diversity of tongues, and 
they are now enjoyed by men ;" and 
we will have these same members 
say to them : "We know the truth 
by the power of the Holy Ghost, 
through obedience to the principles 
of the gospel and the doctrines of 
the Bible. We have come to know 
the truth for ourselves." That is 
what we will continue to do. 

Now, my friends, you who op- 
pose Mormonism, let us reason to- 
gether. What is the use of your 
opposition? You have opposed the 
Church from the beginning, and you 
have seen it grow and increase and 
become mighty in spite of all. The 
blood of the martyrs is the seed of 
the Church, and the Church of God 
grows and thrives on misrepresen- 
tation and persecution. Cease it, 
then. Let me call your attention, 
once more, to that presentation of 
truth made here by Brother Roberts 
which proves that Mormonism is in 
the world for the world's good ; and 
if men will but approach it in the 
proper spirit, with a view to inves- 



tigating its claims, they will see its 
glories and beauties, and will help 
to promote, rather than tear down 
that which, most of all, seeks to lift 
up and make glorious the life and 
destiny of mankind. God bless the 
Latter-day Saints. Be true and 
faithful, and spread these gospel 
truths by example and precept; in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 

Sincerity of the powerful testimony pro- 
claimed by President Smith. — Ambigu- 
ity manifested by Christian ministry 
concerning divinity of Christ, etc. — 
Good homes give strength to the 
Church and to the nation. — Abundance 
of land in Utah for farms and homes. 
Liberality of the government in help- 
ing dry land farmers. 

I crave the blessing of our Heav- 
enly Father upon me while I shall 
speak to you, this morning. I real- 
ize, my brethren and sisters, the re- 
sponsible position that a man is 
placed in when facing an audience 
of Latter-day Saints, and speaking 
of God's goodness and mercies to 
His people. 

A distinct feature of this confer- 
ence has been the testimony that has 
been borne by every one who has 
addressed the congregations since 
last Thursday. They have been 
powerful and earnest testimonies. 
I wish in my soul that every man 
and woman in the Church, and 
every honest soul that lives up- 
on the earth, could have heard the 
testimony President Smith pro- 
claimed last Thursday morning. He 
bore testimony that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God, blest of 
the Lord and called to open the last 
dispensation. He testified of the 
goodness of God to himself, and of 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



69 



the blessings of our Heavenly Fath- 
er to His people. There was no 
equivocation in his testimony, and I 
cannot conceive how it is possible 
for any man or woman who heard 
it to believe that it came from, any 
other than an honest and sincere 
man. While listening to the em- 
phatic testimonies uttered during 
this conference, I could not help but 
think of, and quote, one expression 
recently delivered by an eminent di- 
vine in one of the fashionable 
churches, in one of the great cities 
of this country. He was speaking 
on the subject of belief in God and 
among other things, he said : "With- 
in the dim twilight of revealed spir- 
ituality, troubled ones are constantly 
groping for the hearts-ease that is 
ever denied the traveler this side of 
immortality." My brethren and sis- 
ters, contrast our unqualified testi- 
mony of the knowledge of God re- 
vealed to this people, with the words 
of the divine : "Troubled ones are 
constantly groping for the hearts- 
ease that is ever denied the traveler 
this side of immortality," or, in oth- 
er words, that hearts ease that 
comes to man, that testimonv that 
he is doing the will of God, the un- 
derstanding and knowledge in his 
soul that Christ is the Son of God, 
is denied, so this divine says, to all 
travelers "this side of immortality." 
I want to say to the good people 
here that it is no wonder there is 
mistrust in the minds of the people. 
No wonder there is an utter lack of 
a testimony of the Savior, when the 
people are taught by their ministers 
that they cannot know God, nor 
Jesus His Son, this side of immor- 
tality. That is one of the great dif- 
ferences between the Latter-day 
Saints and all the balance of the 
world. Our teachers and mission- 
aries wherever they go. impress up- 



on the people, even before they are 
ready for baptism, that they can ob- 
tain a knowledge that God lives, 
that Jesus is the Christ and that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
God. When they become mem- 
bers of the Church, and that knowl- 
edge is obtained, they must live in 
such a way as to retain it, and that 
cannot be accomplished in anv oth- 
er way than by keeping His holy 
commandments. 

Let me call your attention, my 
brethren and sisters, to some testi- 
monies of the prophets of God 
in former dispensations, and see 
if there was any doubt as to 
whether they knew that God lived, 
and see whether they knew it this 
side or the other side of immortal- 
ity. Note the striking contrast be- 
tween these prophets of old and 
the modern divine : 

Job says : "I know that my re- 
deemer liveth, and that he shall 
stand at the latter day upon the 
earth ; and though after my skin 
worms destroy this body, yet in my 
flesh shall I see God, whom I shall 
see for myself and mine eyes shall 
behold, and not another ; though my 
reins be consumed within me." 

Jethro, the father-in-law of 
Moses, the priest of Midian — what 
is his testimony? He says, "Now, 

I know that the Lord is greater than 

all gods." 

David, in a psalm of the chief 

musician says, "Now know I that 

the Lord saveth his anointed." 
Peter says, "Now I know of a 

surety that the Lord hath delivered 

me out of the hands of Herod." 
Paul says, "For I know whom I 

have believed," 

John says, "These things I have 

written unto you that ye may know 

that ye have eternal life." 

My brethren and sisters, I thank 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God from the bottom of my heart 
for the testimony I have that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that 
this is His work, and that He will 
have a care for and watch over the 
destinies of His people. I care not 
for all the powers of darkness, of 
evil, of misrepresentation, of false- 
hood, of slander — I tell you that 
they will never retard the growth of 
God's work upon this earth. The 
only thing that can do it is our own 
disregard of the teachings of Christ. 
Individual members of the Church 
may falter and fall, and thus weak- 
en us in numbers ; yet, I have an 
abiding faith in the great majority 
of God's people remaining true to 
the end of their days. I believe 
that the young people who have 
been born under the covenant, will 
be as loyal and true to Mormonism 
as ever were the fathers and the 
mothers that gave them birth. I 
am thankful, indeed, for my testi- 
mony. 

I am thankful, my brethren and 
sisters, that we live in this glorious 
country of liberty. I have no words 
to express my appreciation that I 
am an American citizen, and next to 
that blessing comes the fact that I 
live in Utah. I want to ask all peo- 
ple having homes in the intermoun- 
tain states to maintain them, and 
establish homes for your children 
and thus grow and increase in 
wealth and power. The strength 
of a nation is the home ; the basis of 
the Church is the home ; anvthing 
that interferes with the desire and 
love of home affects the nation and 
the Church. My brethren and sis- 
ters, I want to see in this inter- 
mountain countrv, homes that will 
be pleasing to God — prayerful 
homes, homes blessed with children, 
homes ruled by love, homes filled 
with contentment. T have noticed, 



in studying the history of the world, 
that every powerful nation has been 
made so by its people obeying the 
laws of God affecting the home ; and 
whenever those laws have been in- 
terfered with, no matter from what 
cause — extravagance, affluence, 
wealth, excesses, or any other 
causes, it was not long before the 
nation began crumbling to pieces. 
Oh, would that the people of my 
country would learn from past his- 
tory the causes that destroyed some 
of the greatest powers on earth by 
destroying the home through dis- 
obedience to God's commands. 

I have heard Utah people say, that 
we have no more farming lands, and 
that our boys must go somewhere 
else to secure farms. Many having 
farms have a spirit of unrest. Re- 
member that, "A rolling stone gath- 
ers no moss." I have lately visited 
the great Uintah basin, the Ouray 
basin, the Ashley Valley. There is 
room for an empire in these val- 
leys ; they are desirable sections of 
the country, and if I were a young 
man, seeking to establish myself in 
a home, I know that I could go 
there and in a few vears be abso- 
lutely independent. Our govern- 
ment has passed many laws in the 
recent past with a view of encour- 
aging the people to become the 
owners of homes. Our statesmen 
have learned the lesson that a con- 
tented people must be a home-own- 
ing and a home-loving people. Since 
the homestead law was passed, 
many other measures affecting the 
public domain have been enacted 
into law. Only last year the En- 
larged Homestead Bill was passed, 
giving to every citizen in this state 
a chance to take three hundred and 
twenty acres of dry farm land. 
There are millions of acres in our 
state capable of yielding an abun- 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



71 



dant crop of grain by the process of 
dry farming. If there were only 
two million acres in all the state, 
cultivated, with an average yield of 
only fifteen bushels to the acre, that 
would make thirty million bushels 
of wheat, which means more value 
than the production of all the sil- 
ver and gold in the intermountain 
states, and more than all the sugar 
produced in the west. I only want 
to say there is plenty of land for 
every one of your sons to establish 
a home within the borders of the 
state of Utah. 

Thank God that we live in this 
land, the land that has been held 
in the hollow of God's hand for 
ages, that liberty might be estab- 
lished and a government formed 
granting all men equal rights. Of 
all the states in this glorious coun- 
try, Utah is among the best. It 
seems to me that every time I travel 
in different sections of this land, or 
foreign lands, on my return home I 
see an added number of opportuni- 
ties on every side. I wish that every 
Latter-day Saint, and every citizen 
that calls Utah home, owned their 
own home. Happy is the man with 
a farm large enough for his boys 
to work with him. Coming to Salt 
•Lake the other day, I noticed, in 
one of the beet fields,, a father with 
his five sons, all working together 
with one object in view ; my breth- 
ren and sisters, I felt in my soul 
that, if it were proper to envy a 
man's lot in life, I would envy him. 
He had about him his boys, all 
working to make home happy, all 
interested in one cause, and I 
thought there could be no happier 
position in this world than that of 
the man who held his family close 
about him, and followed the avoca- 
tion which, it seems to me, has al- 
ways been and always will be the 



most independent in all the world, 
that is the farmer's. 

May God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, and may His peace be 
with you. May the counsel that 
has been given during this confer- 
ence be carried home by each of 
you and taught to the people. I 
testify that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, that this is God's work, 
and His watchcare is over it. May 
His blessings abound not only up- 
on us as a people but with every 
honest soul that comes to live with 
us ; for we invite honest men, from 
all over the world, to come and help 
us build the greatest state of all the 
western states. May we uphold and 
sustain God's work, in honesty and 
integrity, as long as we live, is my 
prayer, in the name of lesus Christ, 
Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith an- 
nounced that Professor John J. Mc- 
Clellan will give a recital on the 
grand organ, in the Tabernacle, im- 
mediately after the close of this 
meeting; also stated the arrange- 
ments that have been made for over- 
flow meetings in the Assembly Hall, 
and outdoors, at 2 p. m. Gave no- 
tice that voting for the General Au- 
thorities of the Church, and other 
business, will be attended to in the 
Conference meetings, this after- 
noon. 

The male members of the choir 
sang the hymn : 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee ; 

Lo ! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder David H. Cannon. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, Oct. 9th, 1910. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Anthony W. Ivins. Prof. C. 
T. Thomas conducted the singing 
exercises, in which members of the 
Temple Choir participated. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Lord, we come before Thee now, 
At Thy feet we humbly bow ; 
Do not Thou our suit disdain ; 
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain? 

Prayer was offered by Elder Fer- 
dinand F. Hintze. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and each 
nation, 

And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

All members of Church should be able 
to state good reasons for faith- 
Enumeration of virtues inculcated by 
the Gospel.— Civil laws of this co^n- 
trv as binding as Divine laws. 

The Apostle Paul, among other 
good things which he said to the 
saints among whom he ministered, 
was that they ought always to be 
ready to give to any person who 
might ask them a "reason for the 
hope which was within them." In 
other words, every member of the 
Church of Christ ought so well 
to understand the doctrines of 
His gospel that they would be 
able to explain them, that they 
would be able to expound them, 



and be able, in case any one 
not a member of the Church should 
ask them why they were members 
of it, why they professed faith in 
Jesus Christ as the Savior of the 
world and had identified themselves 
with His Church, that they would 
be able to tell them. I believe that 
this congregation of Latter-day 
Saints — and it would apply also to 
the great congregation which is as- 
sembled this morning in the tab- 
ernacle, and to the manv thousands 
of members of the Church who are 
not in attendance at this conference 
— that, almost without exception, 
men and women would be able to 
give a good reason for their faith. 
In my opinion, in no other gospel 
dispensation, at no other period in 
the world's history, have the mem- 
bers of the Church at large been 
so well informed in regard to its 
doctrine ; never before have there 
been afforded facilities so ample 
that men and women may learn by 
reading from books, and through 
the testimonv of the Lord's ser- 
vants, what the fundamental prin- 
ciples and doctrines of the Church 
of Christ are, as in the dispensa- 
tion in which we live. If there is 
any one of us who does not know 
why we are members of Christ's 
Church, if there is any one of us 
who does not understand the great 
work of the Lord which has been 
established in this dispensation of 
the fullness of times, it is our own 
fault. The Lord desires that every 
Latter-day Saint should have this 
knowledge. He desires that every 
one of us should enjoy the testi- 
mony of the gospel which comes 
to us through the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, by which we know that this 
is the work of the Lord. He de- 
sires us all to understand and be 
able, from our own experiences, t<>

bear witness to the world that the 
gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ 
has in it the "power of God unto 
salvation." We have experienced 
the blessings which have come to us 
through obedience to those doc- 
trines, every one of us, personally, 
and not because of the testimony 
of other men and women ; I thank 
the Lord for this. I thank Him 
that this testimony is not confined 
to any particular class of people in 
the Church. I thank Him that it 
is not spoken in any special lan- 
guage, but that, wherever in the 
world men- and women repent of 
their sins, and believe in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and go down into the 
waters of baptism and are im- 
mersed in similitude of His death, 
coming out of the water in simili- 
tude of His resurrection, the Spir- 
it of the Lord does come upon 
them, and they know by the gift 
and power of the Holv Ghost that 
they have done the will of the Lord, 
and are engaged in His work. I 
bear this witness to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, this morning ; and 
these are reasons which I give to 
the world for my faith, and the hope 
of everlasting life which I have. 

I love the gospel of Christ, be- 
cause it has taught me every vir- 
tue which men and women should 
aspire to. It has taught me that 
I must be an honest man. It has 
taught me that I must be a tem- 
perate man. It has taught me that 
I must be a virtuous man. It has 
taught me>that I must be a merci- 
ful man, that I must be a patient 
man. that I must be an industrious 
man ; that I must love the Lord, 
my God, and seek in my weak- 
ness to serve him, and that as I 
love him so I must love and serve 
my fellow men. It has taught me 
that T must be a law-abiding man, 



that I must love law and order, 
that I must sustain and uphold and 
help to magnify, not onlv the law 
of the Lord, not only that law which 
is spiritual and which deals with 
my conscience and my acts before 
God, my Father, but the law of 
man. 

The laws of men, the civil law, 
is our only safe-guard and protec- 
tion against anarchy, against con- 
fusion ; and I thank God for civil 
law, by which society is controlled 
and governed and held together, by 
which the weak are protected 
against the strong, by which the 
strong are restrained, and by which 
the rights of men and women are 
protected and safe-guarded in 
this country in which we live, 
above every other countrv in 
the world. It is true that civil 
law is not always just what we 
think it ought to be. It is true that 
it does not always conform just ex- 
actly to our ideas. It is true that in 
the administration of civil law, ad- 
ministrators are not alwavs as 
righteous and just as they ought to 
be, and as the righteous would 
have them ; but, my brethren and 
sisters, when we consider the com- 
plex questions which are involved 
in the administration of civil law, 
the wonder is that law makers have 
been able to evolve a system so 
just, so equitable and so nearly 
right according to the law of God 
as the civil law which exists in this 
country today. We must remem- 
ber that civil law cannot be framed 
for special purposes. We must re- 
member that in considering these 
cemplex questions, legislators must 
take into consideration the elements 
with which thev have to deal : that 
the law applies to believers and un- 
believers, to saints and sinners, to 
Greek and Roman ; to Englishmen

and Scandinavian and German 
alike ; that it applies alike to Chin- 
ese, Japanese, and East Indian who 
may come to this land, which has 
been made the land of refuge for 
the oppressed of all nations. So 
I say, when we think carefully, I 
believe we will agree that the civil 
law of our land is good. The gos- 
pel teaches me to be obedient to it, 
to honor it, to sustain it, and to 
uphold it, just as I expect to honor 
and sustain and uphold the laws 
of God. These things pertain to 
the gospel of the Lord^ Jesus Christ. 
They are fundamental, and they are 
good reasons to me why I should 
adhere to the Church for I do not 
find the ''power of God unto salva- 
tion," I do not find that which has 
in it power to redeem men and 
women from the sins of the world, 
outside of it. So I stand here and 
bear witness that it is true. 1 thank 
God that von who arc assembled 
know these things just as well as 
I do. 

May the Lord bless you and 
strengthen your faith, and His 
Spirit continue with you forever, 
that all of us may ne found worthy 
and may find our way back into 
His presence, 1 prav. through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President o£ Southern States Mission.) 

brethren and sisters, in serving 
the Lord we reap everlasting ioy. 
We are not striving for the praise 
of men, but for the praise and hon- 
or that comes from God only. We 
are told, on page six hundred and 
twenty-one of the Book of Mor- 
mon, "And by the power of the 
Holy Ghost ye may know the truth 
of all things." This is a great com- 



fort to the Latter-day Saints. Our 
faith stands not in the wisdom of 
men, but in the power of God. The 
testimonies we have received of the 
truth and divinity of this gospel do 
not rest upon delusions. Our testi- 
monies rest upon the rock of reve- 
lation, ancient and modern. and r 
standing upon that rock we are se- 
cure from doubts, divisions and dis- 
sensions, if we give heed to the 
promptings of the Spirit of God, 
which every faithful Latter-day 
Saint is entitled to possess for his 
or her guidance. More and more, 
it becomes apparent that Joseph 
Smith spoke the truths for which 
the souls of men were and are 
yearning. We ourselves do not ful- 
ly appreciate the benefit and the 
eternal riches that the testimony 
of the truth of the gospel brings to 
us. By the power of the Holy 
( rhost we may know the truth of all 
things ; and as John the Revelator 
said, "The anointing which we have 
received of him" (God) does not 
render it necessary that we be 
taught of men. But we are taught 
1 v the inspiration of the Holy 
( rhost, and led by God's servants 
whom He hath appointed to lead 
and to guide His people to edify 
them and to bring them to the 
unity of the faith. 

What has this testimony of the 
gospel done for us? A great many 
people in the world today are 
considerably exercised over the 
question whether there can be any 
communication from file spirit 
world to this world. Only a few 
weeks ago an eminent scientist and 
philosopher died. He had prom- 
ised his friends that if it were pos- 
sible for him to do so. he would 
communicate with them after his 
death. These people are now living 
in a state of expectancv. filled with 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



75 



a spirit of curiosity and doubt, 
awaiting- the fulfillment of that 
promise. Brethren and sisters, the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost has 
given us an assurance l a knowledge 
that there is communication from 
the spirit world to the earth. But, 
it comes in an orderly manner. God 
does not do anything merely to sat- 
isfy man's curiosity ; but the testi- 
mony He gives to us and the com- 
munications we are blessed with 
are for some specific and useful pur- 
pose. When Stephen beheld Jesus 
seated at the right hand of God 
that testimony was given to him 
in order that he might be able to 
declare of his own knowledge that 
Jesus was the Christ, and that He 
occupied His rightful and fore-or- 
dained place at the right hand of 
God the Father. So when Oliver 
Cowdery, David Whitmer and Mar- 
tin Harris received that glorious 
testimony of the truth of the Book 
of Mormon, and with it the impor- 
tant truth that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God, this testimony was 
given them that they might bear 
that testimony to the world, to the 
conversion of thousands and tens 
of thousands of the children of men 
to a belief in the divine authentic- 
ity of the sacred Xephite record. 

How do I know that immortality 
is a reality, and that heavenly be- 
ings appear at the proper time and 
for the proper purpose, to God's 
servants? Joseph Smith testified 
that he saw the Father and the 
Son. He beheld the God of our 
fathers and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
LJnto every man and woman that 
hath accepted this gospel, that have 
received the Holy Ghost, the Spirit 
of God hath planted in their hearts 
this grand testimony, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God. If 
Joseph Smith falsified when he de- 



clared that he saw the Father and 
the Son, think you that God would 
reveal unto His saints that he was 
a true Prophet? No. The evi- 
dence then is sure, for God does 
not uphold a man who testifies 
falsely. Joseph Smith declared that 
John the Baptist, the fore-runner 
of the Savior, appeared to him and 
conferred upon him the Aaronic 
priesthood. He testified that Peter, 
James and John, who were "pil- 
lars" in the primitive church came 
and bestowed upon him the Mel- 
chizedek priesthood, which gave 
him the authority to establish the 
Church of Christ in the earth and 
preach the gospel to the inhabitants 
thereof, as well as to officiate in the 
ordinances of the plan of life and 
salvation. Do we know that Jo- 
seph Smith spoke the truth? Yes, 
for the Holy Ghost hath borne testi- 
mony to our souls that he was a 
Prophet of God. Nay, more : you 
who have felt the power of the 
priesthood, and witnessed the re- 
markable growth of Christ's 
Church, you who have felt the pow- 
er held and exercised for good by 
the leaders of this Church, know 
that these divinely appointed beings 
did bestow upon the Prophet the 
priesthood of God, and that he 
worked and operated under God's 
guidance by that power in founding 
this Church that shall never more 
be taken away nor given to another 
people. 

Today as in the days that are 
gone, this hope, this testimony, is 
worth all the sacrifice that we are 
called upon to make. We do not 
need to be taught of men, for by the 
power of the Holy Ghost we may 
"Know the truth of all things." 
John the apostle said, "every man 
that hath this hope in him purifieth 
himself, even as Christ is pure."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The Latter-day Saints, imbued with 
this living 1 , divine hope, this glor- 
ious knowledge, this wealth of testi- 
mony, will, by right living, purify 
themselves with this splendid hope 
until they rise to life eternal, heirs 
of God and joint heirs with Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

This is the first time I have had 
an opportunity of attending con- 
ference for some few months, and 
I have enjoyed the conference dur- 
ing the short time that I have been 
permitted to attend meetings, al- 
though I have had some duties that 
have called me away. I hope, the 
few minutes I shall speak to you 
that my mind may be clarified, and 
that such things may come from 
me as a message that will build you 
up, something of the message that 
has been given by the other breth- 
ren who have spoken to you. 

I was impressed with one remark 
that Brother Tvins made, in refer- 
ence to the duty of the Saints of 
God to live up to law. for it is 
living up to law (which is always 
as just as man can make it) that 
makes a man free. Tt is obedience 
to the law of God that makes a man 
live his higher self every day, and 
it is obedience to the law of our 
country and of our state that makes 
good citizens at the polls, good citi- 
zens in our homes, good citizens on 
the street. Obedience to the law 
of God and obedience to the civil 
law raises the saints of the Most 
" High God to the highest types of 
citizenship. Tt is one. trait of Mor- 
monism, that has alwavs been to me 
a leading ethical thought, that the 
more we live up to law in our daily 
lives, the more we live up to our 



higher selves, the freer we become, 
the more intelligent we are, and the 
better interpreters of life are we 
before the world. And I believe 
that the Mormon people, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, have already become 
the best interpreters of the mean- 
ing of life, of any people who have 
been on the face of the globe. 

A few months ago a Doctor 
Pfleiderer, of the University of Ber- 
lin, lectured to the students in the- 
ology, and he declared there before 
his class, that the world had been 
seeking truth for hundreds of years, 
and he believed that gradually had 
the world been finding truth ; but 
above all, what man needs today, 
said the learned doctor, is not so 
much of delving into mystic truth 
that rules the universe, but what 
man needs is to take hold of the 
common man, the common self, in 
the every day affairs of life, and 
teach him to live his best life. That 
is what is needed, it is the uplift- 
ing of the common man. It is the 
making of every human being to 
see the divinitv and the majestv of 
his own power, and standing up in 
that majesty and in that divinity, 
he respects himself as an individual, 
and respects all other people as 
well. In respecting himself as an 
individual, he respects his divinity, 
he respects his virtue, his honor, he 
respects all men ; thereby he lifts 
himself into that grade and that 
standard of moralitv and of man- 
hood and of very soul that makes 
him an ideal man — makes for the 
best, especially of Christian men 
and women, makes for the best type 
of citizenship. We often forget this 
point. 

It has been decreed of every one 
of us that we are divine, that our 
souls are divine, and the organized 
intelligence that we possess means 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 



77 



that we should go on to perfection, 
adding- each day a little to our pow- 
er because of our free will to act. 
It is the majesty and cleanliness of 
the soul that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ teaches us, that makes this 
gospel so great. It is not to be 
wondered at today that Mormon- 
ism has permeated the nooks and 
crannies of the world. It is only a 
few months ago that a poor monk 
in far off Austria wrote a thesis on 
the rise and growth of the Mor- 
mon Church in the United States, 
declaring it to be one of the forces 
of the world with which the world 
has yet got to reckon. Though we 
are in our youth, nay. in our in 
fancy, we will, as we live near to 
God in the dignity and majesty of 
our own souls, become a light to the 
world ; and the world will question 
us, and try to make us out, in time. 
I have faith that the world will yet 
understand us. We must remem- 
ber that over a billion five hundred 
millions of people now living are 
all God's children, and God is just 
as anxious for the Boer or the Hot- 
tentot, or the native of the South 
JSea Islands — just as anxious for 
the misguided girl of the under- 
world, or the pauper of the slums 
in the city, to have them all come 
back to Him as He is for us, or for 
any other people. He is a God of 
love and though we have been 
taught that we are the people of 
God, we are only the people of God 
as we live God's laws, and as we 
live our best selves. As we live 
well and in truth we become the peo- 
ple of love, people of honor, peo- 
ple of integrity and honesty, who, 
when we give our word as indi- 
viduals, will abide by that word. 
When we arise in the morning we 
will dedicate our lives to God, be- 
cause it is from communion with 



our Father that we derive the pow- 
er that enables us to live that true 
life, that high life, that honest life 
for which every Latter-day Saint 
should contend, yea, every Chris- 
tian of the world. And we obtain 
the testimony of the Spirit of God 
through our lives. Mormonism may 
become a mere shell that we lay 
upon the shelf, it may be a mere 
sounding brass to each individual. 
We are to see that with all the acts 
of baptism, the administration of 
the sacrament, with our prayers, 
with our fast offerings, with the 
offering of tithes to God, that be- 
hind it all there stands a cleanli- 
ness, a majesty, a power of our own 
^ouls and intellect, the power to 
know and the power to love, to wor- 
ship Him, for the truth that is in 
Him, and to worship God, and Him 
crucified. That gives us the spir- 
it of Mormonism. We obtain that 
spirit, the truth of it, the sweet- 
ness of it, the very marrow and the 
vitality of it, by our every day lives. 
Not the life of tomorrow, but the 
life of yesterday and the life of to- 
day, which go invariably to mold 
our thoughts for tomorrow. 

I believe, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the revelations of God to 
man. I believe in my country, and 
in my people, and in fact, in all 
the race, for the race is to be saved. 
Mormonism is no condemning in- 
fluence, it is a saving; influence for 
every individual child of the living 
God. And it is an influence, in the 
words of President Young, that 
"makes bad men good and good 
men better." It is an influence and 
power that makes men good loyal 
citizens each day. When we live 
the daily life of practicability, the 
life of practice, we are drawing- 
near to our Maker. The gospel of 
Jesus Christ is, after all, the gos- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pel of the deed, the gospel of the 
act. When Christopher Columbus 
stood before the learned doctors and 
professors of the university of Sala- 
manca, where he had decided to ap- 
pear, one of the old priors of the 
convent near by said to him : ''How 
dost thou know that by sailing west 
new lands may be found?" Colum- 
bus tried to explain, but failing to 
do so he declared it to be the light 
of God to him, and that by sailing 
west he could find new land. "T 
know it," said he, "because my soul 
teaches me the truth of it." So it 
is with the gospel. It is the soul- 
response to life ; it is the spirit of 
truth that we possess it is the power 
to live every day our best selves 
that makes this gospel the gospel 
of Christ in the deed. Though all 
might drift from the Church, the 
gospel of Christ remains true. But 
it is the individual members who 
compose it, who bring to it their 
best selves, their manhood and their 
womanhood, and their sacred hon- 
ors, that give to it the refining in- 
fluence that goes out to teach the 
world. And so the question, I think, 
for us to answer in our own hearts 
is, are we living this gospel as best 
we know how ? I put the question 
to myself sometimes. I some- 
times fear, for Mormonism is so 
great, so majestic, so tremendous a 
power, that with all the knowledge 
we possess we cannot grasp it all. 
So we today should ask ourselves, 
Are we living our best selves? do 
we know for a surety? We should 
be able to answer ourselves. We 
do know for a surety, we do know 
that it is our desire to live this gos- 
pel as best we may. Then it is for us 
from today, and as it has always 
been from the days that the Church 
was organized, to begin again, for 
"every day is a beginning, and 



every day is a day of judgment." 
And it is for us to add a little pow- 
er, add a little knowledge, to our 
store each day, and to let the total 
of that knowledge and that power 
go out to the world, that we may 
convince the world through the pu- 
rity of our lives. Let us remember 
that this is the gospel of the deed, 
the gospel of the act, the gospel of 
thought. 

It is these things which will con- 
vince the world "that God revealed 
Himself to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in these the last davs, and has 
revealed Himself since to men, to 
each individual heart, magnifying 
and manifesting to the souls of all 
the children of God the truth and 
verity of our divine birth. God 
wants all His children to come back 
to Him through the door which he 
has opened, and that door the prin- 
ciples of the gospel, the living of 
the gospel, which means the kindly, 
the loving, the goodly feeling of 
ourselves towards all men, toward 
the earth, and above all toward God. 
That we may sense this keenly and 
feel the majesty and the beauty of 
it, as we go from here, as we go 
on down through life to the end of 
it, I ask, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

( President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

The sweetest joy that has ever 
come to my heart has been in attend- 
ing the general conferences of the 
Church. I remember from a child 
being anxious to come, and having 
made strenuous efforts in the days 
of my early youth to save means 
with which to come to this city for 
the purpose of attending confer- 



ELDER MEL VIN J. BALLARD. 



79 



ences. It has been to me a joy and a 
pleasure such as I have never found 
anywhere else in all the world ; and 
for the past twenty years, nearly 
now, I have been to almost every 
conference of the Church, and have 
attended the meetings thereof. It 
has been an education to me in the 
doctrines of the gospel, and I cannot 
see how a Latter-day Saint can keep 
pace with the mighty progress of 
this work who does not occasionally 
at least, frequently I will say, at- 
tend the general conferences of the 
Church. And now that I have the 
privilege of coming to bear a mes- 
sage to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to help to increase your faith 
and to tell you of the good things of 
the Lord to His Church and to His 
servants, not only in the stakes of 
Zion but in the world, it becomes 
even a more pleasant and easy, and 
a sweeter task, to come to this con- 
ference. I have to tell you that the 
Lord has been merciful and kind to 
us in our ministry, and is helping us 
in our work to such an extent that 
we rejoice to inform you that in 
the Northwestern States Mission of 
the Church, comparing our record 
for the past six months with the 
same six months of a year ago, with 
an increase of ten per cent in the 
number of elders, we have shown 
an increase of 100 per cent in our 
sales of the Book of Mormon, 200 
per cent in the sales of other books 
of the Church, and almost 100 per 
cent in the distribution of tracts, and 
also 100 per cent increase in bap- 
tisms to the Church. Our hearts re- 
joice in the splendid spirit manifest- 
ed-among the elders and in the kind- 
ly feeling of the people towards us. 

In the United States there are 
perhaps five millions of the eighty 
millions of inhabitants who do not 
have or hold any association or re- 



lations with any Christian church. 
The latest statistics show that of 
these eighty millions only thirty mil- 
lions profess Christianity in any 
sense. I know the majority is rath- 
er greater among those who do not 
lions profess Christianity in any 
west than, perhaps, in any other 
section. Indeed as we go irom 
house to house, it is so common, so 
frequent that we find those who 
have no regard for the scriptures. 
They would just as leave we should 
teach them from the Book of Mor- 
mon as they would that we preach 
to them from the Bible, because 
there is a lack of confidence, and a 
lack of interest and reverence lor 
the scriptures ; and we have found 
it necessary to assume to some ex- 
tent, a new line ot procedure in 
preaching the gospel. Indeed, I 
have noticed since I began fourteen 
years ago in the Northern States 
mission to preach the gospel, that 
there has been a wonderful change. 
Many people who then would have 
been willing to listen to the explan- 
ation of the gospel from the scrip- 
tures will not do so now ; and there 
are many who, though you may con- 
vince them by scriptural argument, 
still they are unconverted because 
they do not believe in the divinity 
or sacredness of the scriptures. 

It is taught to us as elders of the 
Church, and I want to emphasize it 
to vou as we do to the elders, that 
the' work did not begin with the 
effort of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and his associates to find what the 
scriptures taught with reference to 
baptism. In fact, as we tell our 
friends, we do not teach baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins 
because the scriptures inform us 
that it was the practice of the apos- 
tles. Not so ; we teach the doctrine 
of baptism by immersion for the re-

mission of sins because no less an 
individual than John the Baptist 
came to earth, and standing upon 
the- banks of the Susquehannah riv- 
er, said to Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, as he laid his hands upon 
their heads: "Upon you. my fel- 
low servants, in the name of Mes- 
siah, I confer the priesthood of Aa- 
ron, which holds the keys of the 
ministering of angels and of the 
gospel of repentance and of bap- 
tism" by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins," and then commanded 
them to go down into the water, and 
the one to baptize the other by im- 
mersion, and that for the remission 
of his sins, and he who had thus 
been baptized to perform the ordi- 
nance for his companion, in the 
same manner. Upon this we have 
founded the doctrine, or the prac- 
tice, the doctrine and the ordinance, 
of baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins. We care not wheth- 
er these scriptures have been sub- 
stantiated as divine — it is a matter 
of little concern, perhaps, or at least 
not vital, that that was the doctrine 
and the practice of Christ and His 
apostles. We lay our hands upon 
the heads of those who have been 
baptized, not because the ancient 
apostles did that, but because the 
heavens have been opened and mes- 
sengers have come from God and 
bestowed the right, the authority, 
and given the divine command ; that 
no less personages than Peter 
James and John, those who held 
the apostleship, came and laid their 
hands upon men's heads and con- 
ferred upon them the gift of the 
apostleship and the power to con- 
fer the Holy Ghost upon others. We 
likewise do not have to refer to 
those scriptures to learn or to testi- 
fy that Jesus was the Son of God ; 
for we know that He was the Son of 



God though the scriptures had nev- 
er spoken of Him. Though Isaiah 
and Jeremiah and the prophets had 
not spoken in a plain and unmis- 
takable manner concerning His 
coming and mission among the chil- 
dren of men, he was still the Son of 
God. In the days of our Savior, 
there were some that said of Him : 
"We do not know who you are ; we 
do not understand you. Moses we 
know and the prophets we know, 
but as for this man Jesus, we know 
him not." Then He said to them, 
"I will not - condemn you, but vou 
shall be condemned of those in 
whom you profess to believe." And 
then He opened to them the scrip- 
tures and read to them the words of 
the prophets in whom they pro- 
fessed to believe, how He should 
come, how the people should re- 
ceive Him, the manner of His doc- 
trine, and how the world should re- 
ject Him, how He should be con- 
demned and lifted up, and He con- 
vinced them from the scriptures that 
they professed to believe, that He 
was the Christ. But He was the 
Christ even had He not been able to 
do this. And so, while we can tell 
the world these things, and they 
might to receive them on the state- 
ment, proven as we are able to prove 
them as these things have existed 
and occurred, still they say "we do 
not know of these wonderful mani- 
festations, but, James we know, and 
Peter we know ; they were witnesses 
of God and prophets and authorized 
servants." And we have to reply, 
like Christ said, "We shall not con- 
demn you, but you shall be con- 
demned by those in whom you pro- 
fess to believe." And then our el- 
ders have turned to the scriptures 
and proved the doctrines to be sus- 
tained by the teaching and practice 
of the apostles, baptism by immer-

sion for the remission of sins, and 
so on, substantiating it by holy writ. 

We have been laboring to estab- 
lish these things from the scriptures, 
in which many people profess to be- 
lieve. But that is not the reason we 
teach them. Thank God, His truth 
is always in harmony with itself, 
and has been indeed in all ages of 
the world, when it has been properly 
stated, and not obscured by false in- 
terpretations. We regard, neverthe- 
less, these scriptures with all sa- 
credness. There is no people in all 
the world who have more reverence 
and love for them than do the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We take second 
place to no people in the work! in 
our regard and reverence for the 
scriptures ; and yet it has not been 
upon these that this, God's Church 
has been founded. They are wit- 
nesses that we have the truth. It 
is in harmony with the truth as re- 
vealed anciently. But though those 
scriptures may be undermined by 
the scoffers among men, though 
they may ridicule them ; though pro- 
fessors of religion may repudiate 
and deny the scriptures, and cast 
odium upon the doctrines of Christ 
and His apostles, and show lack of 
confidence in the commandment of 
God, that "except a man be born of 
the water and of the spirit he can- 
not enter into the kingdom of heav- 
en" — though all these things be re- 
pudiated in the minds of men, yet 
it does not destroy or undermine the 
foundation of God's Church, or of 
God's truth. It is founded on the 
revelations of the Lord to men in 
this age of the world, and it will 
stand although the scripture may 
stand or fall. But the scripture will 
not fall, it will stand. God has giv- 
en evidences to the world of the di- 
vinity of that scripture, and these 
evidences are in the hands of the 



Latter-day Saints. I expect to see 
the day when the missionaries of 
the Latter-day Saints will find one 
of their greatest labors to convince 
the world that these scriptures are 
true ; and there are no people upon 
the face of this earth that have such 
an amount of evidence to substanti- 
ate the truth and the divinity of the 
scriptures. 

They may laugh and scoff at 
Mormonism all they please, yet, let 
me tell you, Mormonism is doing 
more in the world in establishing 
confidence in the good old Bible 
than all the religious denominations 
combined. They have not reached 
the point of those who refuse to be- 
lieve in the miracles of scripture, 
to believe, for instance, that God led 
Israel through the Red Sea dry 
shod, that Christ fed the multitude 
with a few loaves and fishes, or that 
the dead can be raised, or that an- 
gels can visit the earth; but they 
have duplicated and demonstrated 
these things, in almost every in- 
stance, in this age of the world, and 
it is a reality, established by good 
and undeniable evidence. And 
through and by reason of that, we 
are proving by our lives, and by 
the practice of this Church, that 
the claims of the old prophets con- 
cerning the miracles of God, and 
His goodness to them are true. And 
then we have the witness of the 
Spirit to us, convincing to our in- 
ner selves, of the statements made 
by the founders of this Churchy that 
they were not mistaken or deceived, 
but that they actually did see and 
know what they declared. I have 
not seen with my own eyes a heav- 
enly being nor the Son of God, yet 
I believe with much confidence this 
day, that Jesus Christ does live, and 
that He did speak to the earth by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is recognized in the world that 
what knowledge men obtain in this 
world is obtained through the physi- 
cal senses. The eye conveys to 
the intelligence of man that which it 
sees. So with the ear. There is 
something within that interprets all 
these sensations. It received its 
knowledge through the physical in- 
strumentality. The physical instru- 
mentality is not absolutely perfect. 
It may be that we have been de- 
ceived by the eye or the ear. But 
there is something which under- 
stands and interprets the impres- 
sions that come to" the eye or the 
ear. When brought into direct com- 
munication with the gift and pow- 
er of the Holy Ghost, knowledge 
being received both by sight and by 
hearing and by feeling, that feel- 
ing or sensation that comes without 
the physical senses, and that which 
is received is not injured, nor weak- 
ened or made ineffective by the 
physical instrumentality, for it is 
perfect and guides into all truth, and 
I understand more certainly and 
more perfectly when the truth can 
be spoken to my soul in this way. 

When Jesus was raised from the 
dead, some doubted, as you will re- 
member. But the Savior said to 
Thomas, "Thrust thy hand into the 
wounds in my hands and in my 
side." Then Thomas said, after he 
had done so, "Now I know that thou 
art the Christ, and that thou hast 
not deceived us." Jesus said unto 
him, "Blessed are thou, Thomas, for 
thou has seen and heard ; but more 
blessed is he who believeth and yet 
who has not seen." Is it possible 
that I can know and believe as sure- 
ly as Thomas did, and yet have 
not seen ? Yes, it is possible ; I can 
know that he lives, and I can trust 
him. 

O, my brethren and sisters, when 



I think of what God has done for 
us, in this daily temporal life of 
ours ; in this being that we have 
here, the clothing that we wear, the 
air we breathe, the food to eat, and 
all are daily given as manifestations 
of the munificent gifts of God. We 
tli ink it was a wonderful thing that 
He sent manna down to feed Israel ; 
but every day we have as wonderful 
a miracle in the things that we have 
to subsist upon in this world as the 
result of God's munificent gifts unto 
us. I rejoice in the many things that 
He has done. Many people ask how 
they can trust Him, and how they 
can believe in the Lord Jesus Christ 
when they have not seen Him, or 
seen a miracle. You do not need to 
see Him. There is one thing, if He 
had done no other, that ought to 
bring forth such confidence in our 
hearts, and trust in him, that we 
could not doubt His love for us. T 
refer to His most precious of all 
gifts. I do not diminish any other 
gift of God to man, but I do value 
above all other things the gift of 
His Son Jesus Christ to the world. 
Which one of us fathers or mothers 
could stand, with the power to save 
your dear son from being tortured, 
and not exercise that power. But 
let me tell you that you cannot love 
him like God loved His Onlv Be- 
gotten Son in the flesh ; He who had 
been with Him, closely associated 
with Him in His exalted state for 
ages past, who had been selected as 
the lamb slain from before the foun- 
dations of the world, whom He 
loved as we know nothing of, and 
then stand by and see Him in the 
garden of Gethsemane, weeping 
over the sins of the world and try- 
ing, if possible, to find some oth- 
er means, that He might escape, 
and praying, "O Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass." Which 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



83 



one of you could stand and listen 
to the pleading of your son, "O 
spare me, your son," if you had the 
power to save him, and you would 
not save him? O, I am not strong 
enough. Under similar conditions 
I could not be trusted with the pow- 
er to step forth and save my loved 
ones from death. God has not seen 
fit to give me the power to wield it. 
When He strikes our loved ones, we 
could not be trusted with it. We 
would be tempted to exercise it, no 
matter what the consequences might 
be. But here, the Father had the 
power, and yet He listened to that 
Son : "O Father, let it pass, if pos- 
sible. Is there not some other way? 
Can I not do the work acceptably 
to Thee without passing through 
this?" But He answered Him not 
as to any other way ; and the Son 
pleaded until, we are told, the blood 
coursed down His face, so intense 
was His agony, and He reached a 
conclusion — "Let it pass, if possi- 
ble ; but, Father, not my will but 
Thine, O God, be done." 'When He 
had done this, He reached the 
height of His achievement, after 
He had submitted Himself absolute- 
ly to the will of God, and became in 
that a pattern to all men. The Fath- 
stood by, and watched that beloved 
Son dragged forth from the gar- 
den. Christ was able to withstand 
the help that was offered. Peter 
struck off the ear of one of the 
soldiers, and the Savior said, "Put 
up thy sword, Peter. Thinkest thou 
that I cannot even now call legions 
of angels to my help." But He did 
not. The Father could have sent 
multitudes of angels, but He did 
not. Fie was God; that was His 
beloved Son. God saw the crown 
of cruel thorns put upon His head, 
and pushed down till it lacerated 
His brow. He saw, the next day, 



when faint and worn from physical 
exertion, the cross was placed upon 
the back of His beloved Son. He 
saw His Son, fainting, fall in the 
street under the pressure of that 
cross. He saw that Son next 
stretched upon the cross, and the 
nails driven into His flesh. He saw 
the quivering flesh, wounded and 
bleeding, of His beloved Son. Aye, 
He saw the life blood of His beloved 
Son streaming and gushing out, and 
He stopped it not. He saw Him 
next extended between heaven and 
earth, on either side of Him a male- 
factor, and listened to the taunts of 
those who said, "If thou be the Son 
of God, come down ; thou hast saved 
others, why not save thyself." I 
imagine that He had looked upon 
that Son until even the Father could 
not stand it, and He turned to some 
secluded spot and bowed and wept 
for the suffering of His Son, until, 
in the last agonizing throes of ter- 
rible suffering He cried, "My God, 
my God, why hast thou forsaken 
me?" O I am so thankful in my 
heart that whatever doubts may 
have risen in His heart as He looked 
noon the suffering of His Son — 
"Shall I save him, or shall I allow 
him to suffer and die for the 
world ?" O, I thank God that He de- 
cided in your favor and in my favor, 
and by that He has redeemed us. 
made it possible that the grave shall 
not hold us, and that we can come 
back into His presence. OJ rejoice in 
that. And for that manifestation of 
His kindness and of His love, I shall 
trust Him. Yes, like Job of old, 
"though He slay me, still I shall 
trust Him." He may not answer 
my prayers in all things that I seek. 
He may deny me when He sees that 
I would not profit by the things that 
I seek. Shall I doubt Him? Shall 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I fail to love Him and to call upon 
Him, because I do not get what I 
want. Or, shall I feel that He loves 
me not? No; for this kind mani- 
festation of His loving kindness to 
me I shall trust Him^ though He 
slay me. I shall still believe in Him, 
for He has given a manifestation of 
that love that will last me through 
all time and all eternities to come. 
I know, my brethren and sisters, 
that though I may, and you may, 
be disappointed in some things, in 
the end we shall all be satisfied with 
that which the Lord has done for 
us. I rejoice in these things, and 
rejoice in the testimony that I have. 
It makes me feel that after the sac- 
rifices we have made, and through 
the earnestness we exhibit in help- 
ing to carry this message we will be 
given a hope and that fullness of 
love that we cannot help loving the 
world, or loving the souls of the 
children of men. 

I sometimes think that, if some of 
our brethren and sisters who have 
been upon missions could just think 
a little more of the spirit that pos- 
sessed them, when they went from 
door to door seeking the souls of the 
children of men, to save men, that 
we would not pass by some of those 
that we can help here at home. O, 
how we walked across mountains 
and through rivers, in stormy 
weather and under all conditions, 
seeking for some one to listen to 
us. We find some of those out in 
that country where I labor who have 
been offended here at home. Some 
one has not treated them just right. 
Thev perhaps have been themselves 
in the wrong ; but no helping hand 
was reached out for them. Thev 
were allowed to be abandoned, and 
to drift away. Two weeks ae"o, I 
saw such a familv, that had been 
wandering out in the Northwest for 



ten years, offended because of the 
action of some of their neighbors, 
and no helping hand stopped them. 
After I went through the house with 
them, and administered to a Avom- 
an that was sick, O what joy came 
to my heart as I saw their joy; and 
they promised me that they would 
do their first works over again and 
begin anew. I can point out, all 
over the country there, people who 
could be saved and brought into the 
fold if we would only exercise our 
own energy a little more. It takes 
some of our best energy to bring 
back some of those that we care- 
lessly allow to drift away. Here 
is a boy, and there is a boy, whom 
you could save if you sought him 
enough here at home. I have stood 
and gazed upon some of the won- 
derful works of nature, and I could 
not rejoice in them alone ; I had to 
talk to the stranger by my side as I 
have looked at the beautiful water- 
fall. I have had to speak of them, 
or my soul could not contain itself, 
in enjoying these alone. So I feel 
when I contemplate the glorious 
truths of the gospel, I must give ex- 
pression of them to some one else, 
I must find some of the children of 
men who will listen to me, and if 
possible get them to see the beauties 
that I examine with so much pleas- 
ure, that have given me so much 
ioy. But, brethren and sisters, I 
hope that the spirit of love and of 
seeking for the kingdom of God, not 
only in our own interest but in the 
interest of our brethren and sisters 
and friends at home shall orevail 
in our hearts. And those of us who 
have been upon missions, let us ask 
ourselves if it is not possible to aid 
somebody in our own neighborhood 
and do some good in this direction. 
I tell you, my brethren and sisters, 
that it will give you the sweetest 



PATRIARCH JOSEPH E. TAYLOR. 



85 



joy. As you know it gave you joy 
in the mission field, so it will give 
you joy at home. 

I bear witness to you that the 
leaders of this Church are standing 
in the right place, and that their 
counsel and advice to the Latter-day 
Saints is true, and ought to be fol- 
lowed. I am willing to stand bv the 
revelations of God and the teachings 
of His servants of this Church, 
though it may take me within the 
jaws of death. I will stand up be- 
fore the world and defend the lead- 
ers of this Church in their attitude 
and in their counsels and instruc- 
tions to the people. I have confi- 
dence in them, that they have not 
deceived the world. I would rath- 
er die, yes, and give my life over 
and over again, than become a 
traitor, or be untrue to men in the 
pledges and the promises that I 
make, and I know the integrity of 
these men, that they are true and 
faithful before God and this people. 

May God bless us, that we may 
have confidence and love for each 
other, and the fullest confidence for 
our brethren who are called to pre- 
side over us ; and may the spirit of 
this glorious work grow in our lives 
and hearts, until we become firmly 
established, eventually, in the 
Church and kingdom of God. I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PATRIARCH JOSEPH E. TAYLOR 

I have no doubt whatever that 
this large congregation of people 
would have taken great satisfaction 
in being seated in the large taber- 
nacle, and yet I want to bear testi- 
mony to you this morning (and I 
think I shall find a universal re- 
sponse to that testimony) that the 



spirit of this conference has made it- 
self manifest in the utterances of 
the brethren who have spoken to us. 
I have attended, if I am not mis- 
taken, one hundred and twenty-six 
conferences of this Church, in Salt 
Lake City, every conference and 
every session of every conference in 
that large number, the times that I 
have been to conference, with the 
exception of the occasions that I 
have been away filling other ap- 
pointments. I want to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, the burden 
of the testimonies that have been 
borne and the remarks that have 
been made, can be couched in a very 
few words. I am reminded of the 
counsels that have been given to the 
Church many times by the servants 
of God in relation to this matter, 
and especially the counsel Presi- 
dent Young gave on the banks of 
the Missouri river in 1848, just be- 
fore he returned to the valleys of 
the mountains, "Get the Spirit of 
God and keep it." 

Let me bring one thing to your 
attention to emphasize the remarks 
that have been made, and to give, to 
you an idea of the necessity of your 
cultivating within yourselves this 
Holy Spirit. How many are there 
today to be found in all Israel who 
can say to you, "I listened to the 
voice of a prophet of this dispensa- 
tion, and my heart was elevated, my 
mind was rested, and I felt influ- 
enced and expanded under the ut- 
terances that he gave and truths 
that he declared to us." You cast 
around and ask yourselves, how 
many are there who can testify to 
the choice words and gems that fell 
from the lips of the Prophet of this 
last dispensation? Pardon me if I 
go into the quorum of the presi- 
dency of the Church, and then to 
the quorum of the twelve apostles, 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and follow down through the or- 
ganizations of the holy priesthood. 
How scarce indeed are those who 
can be found who can say that I 
saw Joseph the Prophet and heard 
his voice, and quote to us some of 
his choice sayings and instructions. 
And in this connection. I am re- 
minded of what occurred with the 
Savior and with Peter, when they 
were challenged as to what the out- 
side world said of the Savior of the 
world; and when this representa- 
tion had been given, the Savior 
turned to Peter, and he said to him : 
"Whom dost thou say that I am ?" 
Peter replied, "Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God." "Blessed 
art thou, Simon Barjona," was the 
answer He gave, "flesh and blood 
hath not revealed this to thee." You 
have seen me with your natural 
eyes ; you have heard me with your 
natural ears, you have felt me with 
the natural sense of feeling that vou 
possess ; you have listened to my 
voice and instructions, but all this 
experience has not given to you that 
testimony that you possess, that 
knowledge that you possess, that I 
am the Christ. Hence the correct- 
ness of one of the speakers today 
in relation to these natural senses 
of ours. Now the body of this 
Church, the tens of thousands of it, 
in the midst of the organized stakes 
of Zion, as well as those that are 
scattered abroad among the na- 
tions, are largely if not entirely de- 
pendent upon the power of the Holy 
Ghost to give to them the assurance 
and the knowledge that God lives, 
and that Jesus is the Christ, and to 
give to them the assurance and the 
knowledge that Joseph Smith, God's 
choice, and by appointment, became 
the prophet, the seer and the reve- 
lator of the last dispensation. I am 
aware that Joseph is on the other 



side today. But, as we sing in our 
hymn every once in a while, "he 
holds the keys for ever ;" and if we 
could see him on the other side of 
the veil in the councils of the just, 
you would hear his voice lifted up 
in behalf of this people, the keys 
for whose salvation and resurrec- 
tion are in his hands.* 

Now we come to those who have 
followed Joseph. Those of us who 
were acquainted with President 
Young and his ministrations among 
the people, and those of his succes- 
sors. President Taylor. President 
Woodruff, President Snow, can we 
not testify that those men in their 
ministrations to us reflected the 
Prophet Joseph ? Did we not give 
reverence to their counsels and to 
their instructions? Did we not sus- 
tain them as we should sustain them, 
as the representatives of our Father, 
as the representatives of the Proph- 
et Joseph in the midst of the peo- 
ple? Yes. And while my heart was 
made to rejoice in the testimonv tint 
our present President, Joseph F. 
Smith, bore concerning his labo - 
among this people up to date, and 
especially since he occupied the posi- 
tion of President, yet I want to fol- 
low him still farther. Do you know 
that the inspiration of God is in that 
man and dwells there? Do I know 
that he has the word of the Lord to 
deliver to this people, exactly suite' 
to conditions and circumstances as 
they present themselves? Do I' 
know that the true inspiration of 
heaven rests upon him? Yes, I 
know it. I make my deposit bv mv 
confidence in that man. as I would 
make my deposit of money in the 
bank ; and I go to that place of de- 
posit to draw therefrom that which 
I have placed there, together with 
the interest that accumulates be- 
cause of that deposit. This is the 



PATRIARCH JOSEPH E. TAYLOR. 



87 



testimony that I wish to bear con- 
cerning our present President. The 
strength of Brigham Young, let me 
tell you, consisted largely — shall I 
say entirely — in following along the 
line closely and persistently, all the 
days of his ministry among the peo- 
ple, that had been marked out by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. He had 
treasured his sayings in his heart 
concerning this people and their fu- 
ture, and he was prepared to act up- 
on those suggestions of the Proph- 
et, in order that there might be ful- 
filled in the life of the people and 
in their experience, the words of 
the Prophet. And all those other? 
that I have mentioned that have fol- 
lowed him have walked in the same 
path. Our Prophet today, Joseph 
F. Smith, has certainly reflected that 
Prophet of the last dispensation ; 
and he himself, and his actions, and 
. his ministrations in the midst of the 
people, I want to say, are acceptable 
to our Father. Our observance of 
the words that come to us, let me 
tell you, is our strength, our power, 
our deliverance, our advancement, 
and will be eventuallv our glory. 
God, the Father, is essentially a cre- 
ator. God, the Son, as Brother 
Ballard has beautifully shown to- 
day, is essentially the Redeemer. 
God, the Holy Ghost, is essentially 
the witness of the Father and the 
agencies employed by Him, ministers 
to all those who are willing to listen. 
That spirit talks to your spirit; 
it passes by your body. It desires 
to bring you all in subjection to its 
teachings, to its counsels and sug- 
gestions. It will confirm your faith 
in the gospel, and no matter wheth 
er you have all confidence in the 
world in the Testament, in the Bi- 
ble, or in any other book, all th 1 
principles that have ever been re- 
vealed from heaven will be con- 



firmed in you by the power of God, 
and you will never get an assurance 
of these truths short of that. 

Will you and I cherish that spirit 
that has been spoken of so much 
this morning, the burden of the re- 
marks that have been made? If we 
will, we will find ourselves taught 
of God. When we become acquaint- 
ed with the whisperings of that spir- 
it, they will become as familiar to 
us as the voice of any of our earth- 
ly associates, our dearest friends: 

That God may bless us, give un- 
to us power to seek after,^to pos- 
sess, and cherish that spirit, that we 
may be led in the path of life and 
truth, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way ; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Harvey H. Cluff. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Orson F. 
Whitney presided, and the Temple 
choir furnished the singing, under 
direction of Prof. C. J. Thomas. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

What wondrous things we now behold, 
By prophets seen in days of old, 
Whose visions the Almighty Lord 
Confirmed by His unchanging word. 

Prayer was offered by Elder J. 
M. Sjodahl.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The choir- sang the hymn : 

1 lappy the souls who first believed, 
To Jesus and each other cleaved, 
Joined by the unction from above, 
In mystic fellowship of love. 

ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON. 

(President of South Sanpete Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters. 
I can say that I feel very thankful 
to my heavenly Father for His 
blessings to us, for the great priv- 
ilege that we have of assembling 
here in this grand conference of the 
Latter-day Saints, to worship God 
our heavenly Father. I feel thank- 
ful for the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost that has rested upon my 
brethren, the elders of Israel, in 
their testimonies and their counsels 
unto us as His people. 

I have a testimony of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ for myself. I know 
the truth of the gospel that has been 
revealed in these the latter days. I 
am thankful that 1 enjoy the fel- 
lowship of the Saints of the Lord, 
and for the opportunities that we 
enjoy as His people, that we can 
listen to the instruction of inspired 
men of God, filled with wisdom 
and with knowledge, that we can 
learn of His ways and walk in His 
paths. I was very much affected 
by the testimony of our beloved 
President, Joseph F. Smith, at the 
opening session of this conference, 
and the words that he spoke, the 
powerful influence that attended 
him in speaking of himself, that he 
had been true to the cause of God. 
to his brethren and his sisters, and 
all the children of men. I feel, in 
my very soul, that those words were 
true and faithful. I know by the 
spirit of God that our leader is a 
prophet of the Lord, that he is a 



man endowed with the revelations 
of Jesus Christ. I feel this strong- 
ly, and I assure you that I feel to 
uphold and sustain him in his la- 
bors, and ask God that He will 
bless him and support him. When 
I am in the presence of men like 
him, the presidency of our church, 
the apostles that God has chosen, 
and other servants of the Lord, I 
feel that I am' in the presence of 
men endowed with the Holy Ghost. 
I am thankful for them. I thank 
God for His mercies unto us as Flis 
children. 

I have greatly rejoiced in the 
splendid instruction which was giv- 
en this morning,- and in fact during 
the entire conference, and in the 
progress of the work of the Lord in 
the earth. I can discern that there 
has been no better time than the 
present for Latter-day Saints. The 
work of God is spreading in the na- 
tions of the earth, and I believe 
there is good progress made in Is- 
rael, in all the stakes of Zion. 
among the Latter-day Saints. There 
is a greater tendency to live up to 
the requirements of the Almighty 
today than there ever was in the 
church. There is a spirit or de- 
sire among the Latter-day Saints 
to more fully walk in the paths of 
the Lord, and keep His command- 
ments. 

The last hymn that was sung 
here this afternoon, I felt to say, 
was an inspiration. Possibly many 
of the Latter-day Saints, when they 
received the gospel of the Son of 
God, felt those words burning in 
their souls. The gospel has taught 
us to be one. to be united. I take 
it that a great many of the Latter- 
day Saints who have come from 
various parts of the earth, who re- 
ceived the gospel in foreign lands, 
have experienced that great love

within their bosom when they went 
down into the waters of baptism, 
and had hands laid upon them and 
received the Holy Ghost. I am sure 
they felt that oneness and union 
with each other. As was testified 
of this morning, wherever you go, 
in every land and clime, wherever 
Latter-day Saints are abiding, there 
you find the same spirit. They are 
of one heart and mind, the spirit of 
love exists among the Saints wher- 
ever they are found. 

When the elders of Israel came 
unto us, bearing the message of life 
and salvation, we felt in our souls 
that they were the servants of the 
Lord, because their lives were clean, 
their hearts were pure, and they 
lived the gospel in their every day 
walk and conversation. That ap- 
pealed unto us. And so among the 
Latter-day Saints today, we feel 
that spirit when we have the testi- 
mony of Jesus with us. We feel 
the same in relation to the brethren 
who stand at the head of the Church 
of Christ in the earth. As a rule 
all Latter-day Saints believe in the 
first principles of the gospel. We 
all believe in the principles and or- 
dinances of faith, repentance, bap- 
tism and the laying on of hands for 
the reception of the Holy Ghost ; 
we all feel that they are essential to 
salvation, and that gives joy and 
consolation unto us. But it is nec- 
essary that we continue onward, 
that our works may be in harmony 
with our faith, and while these out- 
ward ordinances are kept in re- 
membrance, we go on unto perfec- 
tion, improving every day we live. 
Every blessing that is promised un- 
to the Latter-day Saints is predi- 
cated upon faithfulness and endur- 
ance in the observance .of the laws 
that God has given unto us, being 
honorable in our lives, pure in our 



spirits, upholding and sustaining the 
work of the Lord upon the earth. 

I rejoice in being able to testify 
that I know the gospel has been 
restored unto the earth, and by 
yielding obedience unto the same, 
all the blessings pertaining there- 
unto have been given to the Latter- 
day Saints. The signs that were 
promised unto believers are enjoyed 
by those who live in accordance 
with the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

We are engaged in a great work, 
not only preaching the gospel 
abroad unto the children of men, 
but we are also engaged in the work 
of redemption of the living and the 
dead at home, in our temples. We 
have a great work to perform, that 
we might perfect ourselves, that we 
might be one with the dead who 
are our kindred, that they might be 
one with us, according to the gos- 
pel that has been revealed unto us. 

I have had the privilege of la- 
boring for a great many years in 
the temple of God, and I rejoice in 
seeing the earnestness of the living 
in behalf of hundreds of thousands 
of the dead that are being officiated 
for in the temples of our Lord. The 
number of the dead that have had 
the ordinance of baptism performed 
for them in our temples is now 
nearly approaching the two million 
mark. Temple work is not for the 
living only, those who are now in 
this earthly existence, but it is 
equally essential for those who have 
gone behind the veil and our hearts 
go out to them in love. The latter- 
day Saints are obtaining the gene- 
alogies of their kindred, ferreting 
out their connections and relations, 
so that they may be able to do this. 
The spirit of Elijah is working upon 
the children of men, not only upon 
the Latter-day Saints but upon the 
children of the world, as has been 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



testified to during this conference. 
Hundreds of books and many thou- 
sands of names have been printed, 
containing the genealogies of the 
people in various nations, and the 
Latter-day Saints are obtaining 
these genealogies. I know also that 
a great many men of leisure and of 
means have been wrought upon by 
the spirit of God to compile pedi- 
grees and gather together the names 
— for what purpose they know not, 
but the Latter-day Saints under- 
stand that it is the working of the 
Spirit of the Lord upon the hearts 
of the children of men, that His • 
people may be able to obtain the 
names of their kindred dead, and 
thus be able to do Temple work for 
their salvation. 

I bear you my testimony that 
this is the work of the Lord that 
Jesus is the Christ and that Jos- 
eph Smith is a Prophet of the living 
God and that those who bear rule 
at the present time. President Smith 
and his brethren, are servants of the 
living God that they are faithful 
men in the right place. May we 
as Latter-day Saints uphold and 
sustain them by our faith and pray- 
ers and good works, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER WM. H. SEEGMILLER. 

(Late President of Sevier Stake.) 

I realize it is an opportunity that 
should be valued by any of our 
brethren or sisters, to stand before 
the people and to testify concern- 
ing the work of our Father, in 
which we are engaged. I know it 
is the work of God. I learned it 
when I was a youth. In 1861, I 
first heard the Elders of Israel 
preach the gospel. My heart was 
pricked with what they said. I 



began an investigation of the truths 
that they taught. I found they co- 
incided with that which was taught 
by the Savior and His apostles and 
disciples in the meridian of time 
I had, although young at the time, 
read some of the lying literature 
that was published in the magazines 
against the Latter-day Saints. I 
read in Harper's Weekly of Vie 
Mountain Meadow Massacre. I 
read of the killing of the "dummy" 
over here between the Big and the 
Little Mountain. I read some other 
things, all calculated to prejudice 
one against the Latter-day Saints. 
I did not know what kind of a peo- 
ple they were. But when I heard 
the elders preach the gospel, I 
wanted to know. The elders prom- 
ised us that if we would obey the 
Gospel we should know. I thought 
that was a wonderfully fair proposi- 
tion and, in the spirit of putting the 
matter to the test, my brother and 
I offered ourselves for baptism, and. 
thanks be to our heavenly Father, 
as I was being raised up out of 
the water by the person officiating 
in the ordinance of baptism, my 
Father in heaven gave me a testi- 
mony. I knew that my sins were 
forgiven. I knew that the gospel 
was restored, and the priesthood, 
and I knew that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God. And O, how 
pleased I am to make the statement 
here today, that from the moment I 
received this testimony, I have nev- 
er doubted it. It came to me with 
such force that all doubt was cast 
out, and I felt there was but one 
thing for me to do, during my life, 
and that was to labor to advance 
the cause of God in the earth. I 
have been engaged in that labor 
since that time, at home and abroad. 

Elder Whitney stated that I have 
lately been released from the pres- 
idency of the Sevier Stake of Zion.

I was associated with the presidency 
of that stake for 37 years. I enjoyed 
my labors. I have rejoiced in see- 
ing the fruits of my labors and that 
of my associate brethren and sis- 
ters. In the district of country that 
I have lived in great changes have 
taken place, from the time of first 
settling there up to the present time. 
The people settling in that country 
were poor people. Some of them 
had abandoned their homes because 
of Indian troubles, and they were 
returning, poor people in search of 
other land and places to make 
homes. At first most of our people 
lived in dugouts. A great change 
has come, and today most of them 
are enjoying comfortable homes. 
Our country there is what is known 
as a greasewood country, a forbid- 
ding looking part of the world. 
When President Young and his 
brethren were passing through that 
district, in an early day, around the 
camp fire he asked the brethren 
what they thought of the country. 
Some of them said they would not 
give a lot in the "Big Field," in Salt 
Lake County, for the entire coun- 
try. Others, living on the Cotton- 
woods, in this county, said they 
would not give their farm there for 
all they had seen. The soil was 
red, and its appearance was forbid- 
ding. They did not know the value 
or fertility of it. President Young, 
after listening to them, made the 
statement that he could see facili- 
ties there for sustaining 150,000 
people. I believe he was correct. I 
believe that when the facilities of 
that country are developed — and we 
are making good success in the de- 
velopment that 150,000 people can 
be sustained in Sevier county- God 
has blessed our efforts. We have 
been able to get the waters out up- 
on the land, though at great cost. 



One canal that we built in that 
country represents an outlay of 
over $80,000, a reservoir that we 
constructed, close on to $100,000. 
Now the State has taken hold of 
another enterprise in the establish- 
ment of another reservoir, and in 
the enlargement of our $80,000 
canal, building and extending the 
canal, so that it will reach a distance 
of about 50 miles. 

When President John Henry 
Smith was talking this morning 
about the facilities that abound in, 
the Uintah country, I could not help 
but think we did not need to go off 
quite so far as that. People can 
find homes closer than that, if they 
want to have homes of their own. 
But you know some of us are wed- 
ded to the city. I could not help 
but think, last night, as I was mov- 
ing around your city here, what 
wonderful attractions you possess. 
Why, I could not count all the the- 
atres and places of amusement that 
you are provided with. When we 
settle in the outlying districts, if we 
have anything of this kind, we must 
provide it ourselves. But this can 
be done. It is being done, and the 
Latter-day Saints are rejoicing 'in 
the prosperity that attends their ef- 
forts in the establishment of komes. 

This is the work of God. His 
name is written upon it. We can 
assist Him, but the honor and glory 
of achievement that will be brought 
about in the due time of our heav- 
enly Father will be His. All of our 
labors and efforts to accumulate 
means, to improve our surround- 
ings, to make them inviting and 
pleasant should all be made or per 
formed with the feeling that we are 
striving to advance the purposes of 
God in the earth. » 

The prophet Joseph Smith made 
known this eternal truth, that man

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cannot be saved in ignorance. Then, 
what intelligence is necessary to sal- 
vation ? Why, that intelligence that 
will lead to an understanding of the 
gospel, to living its principles, and 
to devoting our lives, our time, our 
talents and the means that God may 
bless us with, in the advancement of 
His purposes in the earth. Nothing 
like it has ever been established. In 
it is a mighty destiny, and we will 
triumph with Him. But if we do. 
it will be because we live up to the 
gospel that we have embraced. It 
'wont do for us to persuade ourselves 
to doubt the Savior, as did the 
young man who had lived so noble 
a life. He had kept the command- 
ments, but one thing he lacked. The 
Savior said to him : "Sell all thou 
hast and give it to the poor and fol- 
low me." He could not do it. He 
was an idolater. He loved money 
more than he loved the Savior and 
the righteousness of God, and he 
turned away sorrowfully. O, I 
hope that we will not turn away 
sorrowfully. What is the price to 
be paid for eternal riches? It need 
not be money, but it must be -faith- 
ful service rendered to our heaven- 
ly Father. All will receive the 
blessings that our heavenly Father 
has prepared for them, upon condi- 
tions of their faithfulness. Eternal 
life is the greatest gift of God, eter- 
nal life associated with eternal 
riches, eternal intelligence, eternal 
everything that is desirable, may be 
secured but it can only be secured 
by rendering faithful service to our 
heavenly Father. 

God grant that we may do this, 
that we may never become weary in 
well doing, but that we may avail 
ourselves of every opportunity that 
is opened before us for assisting in 
our Father's work, for they are op- 
portunities leading to eternal riches. 



When we get through with this life 
we cannot take anything temporal 
with us but if our lives have been 
devoted to the service of God, even 
if when we die we go to a pauper's 
grave, yet are we the children of 
God, and will inherit eternal riches. 
Which may God grant, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE H. BRIMHALL. 

(President of B. Young University.) 

My brethren and sisters, this is 
a very unexpected circumstance in 
my life. I shall need your faith and 
prayers for the few moments that I 
stand before you. 

I have found that one of the great 
ills that comes to humanity is 
through the incapacity to judge mo- 
tive. It appears that there were 
intelligences in the heavens before 
this world was made, that were in- 
capable of comprehending motives. 
There were at least some spirits 
there who could not judge the mo- 
tive of the great Father. I fancy 
that there must have been a tre- 
mendous unheaval in the realm of 
the spirit world when that brilliant 
spirit — brilliant as to some forms 
of concepts, brilliant as to expres- 
sion, intelligent, keen, active in cer- 
tain lines, and yet he could not un- 
derstand the motives of his Father. 
It would appear that he looked up- 
on what the great Master was do- 
ing, what Jesus Christ was doing, as 
something calculated to rob men, or 
rob spirits, of their freedom. He 
could not comprehend that the work 
of his Father had been one of sac- 
rifice, one of toil, one of labor, men- 
tal and physical, for the good of 
the spirits there. He could com- 
prehend his Father only as one who 
used His children as instruments to 
enhance His own glory, regardless 



ELDER GEORGE H. BRIMHALL. 



93 



of the children. Now why was that? 
Well, it is because intelligences are 
bound by certain laws of the mind 
to measure the motive of others by 
the motive that would actuate them- 
selves under similar circumstances. 
And I today pity myself, I pity my 
fellow men, when I consider or 
know of either myself or my fellow- 
men indulging in criticisms that 
question the motives of my breth- 
ren whom God has honored with a 
position of leadership in the midst 
of this people. They are not about 
questioning my motive. I have of- 
ten thought, in my close communion 
with my brethren, that they have 
been daily hoodwinked. And when 
I study these problems that thev are 
working with, I can plainly see that 
what to me seems emphatic trust, or 
mis-placed trust or credulity in the 
honesty of men, comes from this 
great law that permits men to 
judge the motives of other men by 
the motives that would actuate them 
in similar positions. It appears 
sometimes that our brethren, in 
trusting the saints, in trusting the 
stranger, know no bounds of con- 
fidence that they repose in them. 
And why is it? Why, the laws that 
govern the human intelligence gov- 
ern them in a consciousness within 
their bosoms of unselfishness in 
their work, honesty of purpose, no- 
bility of character in their com- 
munion with their fellow men. I 
say to the world, there is no greater 
proof of the integrity of men than 
the fact that they do so trust their 
fellow-men. 

My brethren and sisters, I came 
here to this conference for one thing 
more especially than any other, and 
that was to vote. O, I think so 
much of my franchise, my franchise 
as an American citizen, to be able 
to speak and pray as any man ; and 



I no less appreciate my franchise 
in this Church. I have today voted 
to sustain my brethren, and I hope 
before the Lord and His angels, 
that I shall not be in my household 
with a desire to criticize, or be in 
the assemblies of our University, 
in the class-rooms with such a feel- 
ing. I hope the walls of no other 
place shall echo the sound or voice 
of a negative criticism of my breth- 
ren. I hope it will not be heard in 
the home. Do you know, there are 
plenty to do these things. It is not 
our mission. I read here in the reve- 
lation of John where it says, "He is 
fallen, is fallen, he who accused, the 
accuser of our brethren before God 
day and night." I would not be able 
to go before the Lord in my prayers 
with any spirit of fault-finding 
with my brethren. I would not be 
able, with any spirit of fault-finding, 
to meet my fellow-men. I desire 
to sustain and support my brethren 
by my spirit. I want to support 
them. I don't want to have to say 
good things about them without 
feeling them. Is there a Latter-day 
Saint here today, is there in yonder 
building (the tabernacle) under the 
influence of the spirit that has dom- 
inated this meeting, the Spirit of 
God, that is not filled with the spirit 
of supporting the brethren and sis- 
ters we voted for today? This 
spirit should be taken to our schools, 
to our home meetings, and right in- 
to our own household. 

It is a splendid thing that in the 
economy of the gospel there is an 
adversary. That very adversary, will 
not let you nor me receive one iota 
of exaltation at the hands of our 
Father that we are not entitled to. 
He would stand there and say: 
"Stop, I demand that the law be 
executed here." But for all that the 
debts that the Savior pays for us he 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cannot stop, he cannot prevent us 
getting a reward for what we have 
done, for ourselves, if the Lord will, 
through our Savior, forgive us. 
Now I want to be, not simply for- 
giving to my brethren, but I want 
to be loyal. May the Lord help us 
to be so loyal to our brethren, loyal 
to their priesthood. May the Lord 
help me to be loyal, loyal to the 
covenants that I have made in rais- 
ing my hand, in your presence, to 
sustain and support my brethren, 
that I may not even feel like criticis- 
ing my brethren before men, any 
more than I would feel like de- 
nouncing them before high heaven. 

May the Lord help us to stand 
by our covenants, and He will ^tand 
by us ; and He will redeem us. He 
will forgive us, and blot out our 
sins that we cannot blot out our- 
selves, and we will stand before 
Him in the eternal worlds as being 
one with Him, and we will not be 
in the attitude of fighting against 
the Lord, but always working with 
Him; which is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ed the names of the General Au- 
thorities of the Church, and they

tions named, by unanimous vote of 
the congregation.

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON. 

(Of Pioneer Stake Presidency.) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the opportunity of adding my tes- 
timony to the testimonies of my 
brethren who have spoken this af- 



ternoon. While I realize the re- 
sponsibility that rests upon every 
one who is called to speak to the 
Latter-day Saints, and to testify of 
the hope that is within him, I do 
feel to rejoice and bear my testi- 
mony to the divinity of this work. 
I rejoice in the opportunity of at- 
tending this conference, and of lis- 
tening to the sound instructions and 
counsels which have been given the 
Latter-day Saints for their welfare. 
I rejoice in the prosperity that is 
being enjoyed by the Latter-day 
Saints, and in the many evidences 
which are manifest of this prosper- 
ity, of the manner in which the 
Lord is blessing the Latter-day 
Saints, both in a spiritual and tem- 
poral way. 

I have felt and realized that 
while the church is growing in num- 
bers and increasing in spirituality, 
there is evident also a tendency on 
the part of some of its members to 
grow cold and to fall into paths of 
temptation. There are so many al- 
lurements and temptations in the 
way of our young people that there 
are many who are being tempted, 
both in this city and in other parts 
of the land, some of whom are being 
led astray by those things which 
tend to lead them out of the path of 
truth, and to make them indifferent 
to the truths of the gospel, and to 
the importance of living in accord- 
ance therewith. 

I have had the opportunity, re- 
cently, of visiting various parts of 
the state, and I was struck with the 
remarks made here this afternoon 
by Brother Seegmiller, and also 
this morning by Brother Smoot with 
regard to the opportunities which 
are before us as Latter-day Saints 
and before the people generally. I 
feel that the Lord has blessed the 
people. When we consider the pro- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON. 



95 



gress that has been made in this 
country, in this state of ours, in the 
last fifty or sixty years, we have oc- 
casion to be doubly thankful to the 
Lord for His blessings which He 
has given to us, that He has given to 
our parents and to those who have 
gone before, who have come here as 
pioneers, and established this peo- 
ple in the midst of this land. Re- 
cently I stood upon one of the foot- 
hills overlooking the Utah Valley, 
and the thought came to me this 
morning, while I was listening to 
Brother Smoot, of something that 
occurred to me there. I looked over 
that valley, and I can assure you, it 
was one of the most magnificent 
sights I ever beheld, to see the many 
manifestations of the prosperity that 
is attending the people generally in 
that section of country. While I 
saw the people cultivating the land 
and gathering the fruits thereof, I 
saw also that there is ample room 
for very many more to settle in 
that part of the country, as there is 
also room to settle in this county, 
and to settle in many other places 
in this state. There are many op- 
portunities for us, as Latter-day 
Saints, of which we can take advan- 
tage to introduce industries in the 
midst of the people. These things, 
I believe, are being realized to a 
great extent by the Saints, and they 
are in line with the spirit that was 
manifest through President Brig- 
ham Young when he brought the 
people to this country, to organize 
the elements, to improve conditions ; 
and while they are improving their 
temporal condition, to improve their 
spiritual condition also. 

I believe that we have great op- 
portunities before us ; and among 
the greatest opportunities is the im- 
provement of the young people, the 
improvement of the home, the pow- 



er to draw around us the children, 
and to teach them those things that 
are for their welfare, that will es- 
tablish them in the truth, and that 
will enable them to remain true and 
faithful in after years. It seems, 
sometimes, in looking over the con- 
ditions which prevail within the city, 
that the temptations and trials which 
our young people have to undergo, 
the tendency to be led away from 
the truth, to indulge in the pleas- 
ures of the world, and to become in- 
different to those things which are 
considered sacred, are greater today 
than they ever were before, that 
the tendency among the people to 
follow those things, to be led away 
in youth, has increased. At the 
same time, I believe the opportuni- 
ties which are before the Latter- 
day Saints for the improvement of 
their children are such that they can 
have greater control and greater 
influence with them in their homes 
and families, and in their surround- 
ings, if we exercise the spirit of the 
Lord, the spirit of wisdom, in our 
dealings with our children, and un- 
dertake to train them up in such a 
way that they will be a source of 
joy unto us. 

I have had the oDOortunity of be- 
ing in the mission field. On various 
occasions I have partaken of the 
spirit of the Lord there to an even 
greater extent than I ever enjoyed 
in any other part of my life. I have 
rejoiced in the spirit that is mani- 
fested by the missionaries, and I feel 
that this spirit comes through the 
elders willingly taking upon them- 
selves the labor to which they have 
been called to work in the service 
of the Lord, a willingness to make 
sacrifices and to go out into the 
world to meet persecution and pros • 
ecute this work in humility and !n 
faith. I realize that in this way our 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



young men are strengthened and 
broadened in their comprehension of 
the truth, they obtain a reason for 
the hope that is within them ; they 
can testify of the truth, declare it in 
plainness and substantiate it by the 
scriptures. Sometimes here at home, 
through not having had the experi- 
ence, these things are, in a degree, 
lacking, because they have not had 
occasion to meet and benefit by these 
experiences nor be subjected to the 
temptations that are met with in the 
world. 

I believe every one of us who will 
endure in the truth, will be tried 
and tested, as the Prophet Malachi 
said, as by fire. He says the time 
will come, when the messenger (the 
Savior) will come to His temple, 
and shall sit and purify the sons of 
Levi, even as gold and silver are 
purified in the fiery furnace. We 
realize from this, partially, the man- 
ner in which the sons of Levi will 
be purified and sanctified. I believe 
that every one of us Latter-day 
Saints will be tried and tested as 
gold is purified, that the dross will 
be removed from us. We will be re- 
fined and purified through the trials 
that we undergo, and we will thus 
be developed and draw nearer to 
the Lord and seek to serve Him. 
Now, I believe that one of the 
things that is going to test the Lat- 
ter-day Saints is the test of pros- 
perity, the prosperity which we are 
enjoying and which we have en- 
joyed, and which the people will en- 
joy to a greater extent in the future. 
I believe this is going to be one of 
the strongest and severest tests to 
the Latter-day Saints. We find that 
people, generally, who are prosper- 
ous become indifferent to the things 
of the Lord. This has been the case 
in history, both sacred and profane. 
We learn from the Book of Mor- 



mon that while the Lord has blessed 
the people, and has promised that 
if they would be faithful, He would 
bless them in temporal as well as in 
spiritual matters, when the time has 
come that they have been blessed in 
almost everything they could desire, 
they have become indifferent, they 
have lost the spirit of humility, and 
have reveled in the pleasures and 
luxuries of life, forgetting the 
Author and Giver. This has been 
the case in the history of the na- 
tions, when the people have been 
humble, poor, industrious, and had 
to labor for their living, labor earn- 
estly and hard, they have developed 
those characteristics and virtues that 
have tended to make them great ; 
but when they have enjoyed luxury 
and prosperity they have become in- 
different to principles of virtue, hu- 
mility, and uprightness, have been 
led away and have fallen. This has 
been the history in very many cases. 
I believe that while we as Latter- 
day Saints are enjoying prosperity, 
through the blessings of the Lord 
and our own efforts, we should con- 
tinue to bear in mind the import- 
ance of training our children in such 
a way that they also will labor for 
that which they obtain, because they 
will then appreciate that which their 
fathers and mothers have done to 
secure these things. President 
Roosevelt has made the statement 
that there are two classes of parents 
to be condemned those who are too 
strict with the children, and those 
who are too indulgent. Of the two, 
he said those who were over-indul- 
gent were the worst, that in indulg- 
ing their children, in getting them 
things that they did not appreciate, 
they were hurting them in such a 
way that it would redownd to the 
injury of the community at large, 
and to themselves as individuals. I

believe that, as Latter-day Saints, 
there is nothing- that will tend so 
much to our joy and happiness here- 
after, and in this life, as to train up 
our children so that they will appre- 
ciate the blessings they have, and 
to do this they should learn to labor, 
and comprehend the importance of 
working every day, both in a spir- 
itual and in a physical way. 

My father has expressed himself 
on one or two occasions publicly, I 
believe, that he would rather that his 
children should die than that they 
should depart from the church ; and 
I desire to bear my testimony to 
this effect, that I would rather die 
than lose the testimony of the gos- 
pel ; I would rather die than become 
so affected in any way that I would 
lose the spirit of this work, because 
I know that it is true. I know this 
work is true, and that it means the 
salvation of every human being who 
will remain true and faithful, who 
will covenant that he will, in hu- 
mility and faith, endeavor to live up 
to the commandments of the Lord 
and the revelations that He has 
given, and comply with the instruc- 
tions and counsels of those who 
have been placed to lead the people. 

I rejoice in the spirit that has 
been manifest in this conference, 
and in the testimonies that have 
been given to us. I rejoice in the 
integrity of the servants of the Lord 
who are called to guide this work 
and direct it. I know they are men 
of God, and that they have been 
blessed in those positions, that they 
have been placed there by proper 
authority, that they have received 
revelations from the Lord to guide 
them and to guide this people ; and 
I realize that this work is pro- 
gressing. The only fear I have is 
as to whether I will be able to re- 
main true, as to whether you will 



remain true, and as to whether we 
shall be able to exercise such an in- 
fluence with our posterity that they 
will be true, because our salvation 
here and hereafter depends greatly 
upon our children as well as upon 
our fathers. As plainly stated in 
the revelations of the Lord, we are 
bound to one another, the children 
to the fathers and the fathers to the 
children. Through the revelations 
of the Lord concerning the sealing 
ordinances, we are made to realize 
that our salvation depends largely 
upon those who have gone before 
and upon those who ' shall come 
hereafter. 

I pray that we may be true, and 
that we may carry with us the spirit 
of this conference, and seek to put 
into effect the instructions imparted, 
that in going to our homes we may 
seek to introduce in our families 
and homes and communities such 
things and influences as will tend to 
develop our young people aright 
that they may grow in those things 
that are for their welfare and bet- 
terment, that they may not spend 
their time idle on the street corners 
or anywhere else, telling vulgar 
stories, forming vicious habits that 
will be fixed upon them for life, 
but that they will do those things 
that shall tend to their progress and 
development in all that is good in 
this life and in eternity. I pray that 
the Lord will bless us unto this end, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ARNOLD H. SCHULTHESS. 

(Of Liberty Stake Presidency.) 

I shall not detain you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, but during the very 
few moments which I shall occupy 
I desire, above all things, that I 
may have the attention of every per- 
son in this house and the help of

the Spirit of the Lord, to bless me 
and to bless you. With my breth- 
ren, I rejoice in the blessings of 
this conference and the spirit which 
has characterized the various ses- 
sions of the same. While listening" 
to the brethren I was thinking what 
a variety of good things we are re- 
ceiving at each conference. I ven- 
ture to say that not one man or one 
woman has attended any or all of 
the sessions of this conference, who 
came desiring to hear the word of 
God, who has not been impressed, 
if not with everything that has been 
said, with some certain thing, or 
some certain instructions along a 
certain line. When we sum it all 
up, we come to the conclusion that 
whenever we come together in the 
name of the Lord, hungering for 
the word of the Lord, that the Lord 
always has something for each of 
us. 

I was very much pleased to hear 
the testimonies of the brethren con- 
cerning those who are our leaders. 
I love to hear the brethren speak 
well of them, because I know that 
that which they have said, and do 
say, is true. I think very often that 
as a people who are blessed with 
so many good men and good wom- 
en, we are altogether too slow and 
too backward in speaking well of 
the good noble qualities of the men 
and women with whom we are 
blessed and associated. We have, 
in every ward, and in every stake 
of the Church, men and women who 
are devoted to God and to His work. 
Think of the bishops who devote 
so much time in an unselfish way 
for the good of the people, and 
many other brethren associated with 
them. Think of our sisters in the 
Relief Society organizations, who 
are called out frequently at almost 
any hour of the day or night — it 



makes no difference to them when 
the call comes — who are always on 
hand to minister and bless others. 
And when I think of their unsel- 
fish, loving service in God's work, 
I feel that we do not bear testimony 
often enough of their goodness. 
You know that the Savior, when 
He was upon the earth, found fault 
with the Scribes and Pharisees, be- 
cause they did honor to those who 
had lived long ago, and decorated 
their graves, but those that were 
sent of God into their midst they 
did not receive. They did not ap- 
preciate them, but even sought to 
put them to death. The Savior was 
crucified, the apostles were put to 
death, all except one. I do not mean 
to compare the Latter-day Saints 
with the Scribes and Pharisees to 
whom the Savior spoke, but I some- 
times think we are too dilatory in 
speaking well of our brethren and 
sisters, as though we would say, 
"Yes, that is a good man, but don't 
you tell that to any man until he is 
dead, and then we will say all the 
good things we can about him." 
Let us say all the good things we 
can about our brethren, and our 
sisters, our good men and women, 
while they live, and thereby 
strengthen their influence among 
the people in the earth. I want to 
tell you that when I witness the 
unselfish and faithful service of our 
men and women in the various or- 
ganizations of the Church, I lose 
sight of their weaknesses, no mat- 
ter what or how many they are. 

I have thanked the Lord, and I 
do thank the Lord today, that we 
have men in our midst who are 
called of God, prophets and apos- 
tles, who hold the same authority as 
did the apostles and prophets of old. 
While Brother Penrose was speak- 
ing this morning upon this subject.

that of authority, and the differ- 
ence that distinguishes the Church 
of Christ from the various churches 
of Christendom in the world, I was 
reminded of something which I re- 
cently read in the Deseret News. 
I will relate it to you very briefly. 
The article reported the wonder- 
ful accomplishments of some of the 
students of a certain university in 
the East, in the laboratory. It re- 
ported that young men students 
had extracted sugar from an old 
piece of cloth, a piece of an old 
coat. They extracted sugar also 
from a piece of wood, and other 
things of such character. But the 
point I want to call your attention 
to is this : They took some wheat as 
it came from the field. It was ground 
up and separated into different sub- 
stances, the bran, the flour and other 
elements. Then they took those 
various substances and put them to- 
gether again, and made complete 
kernels of wheat, just as they were 
before ; so that no difference, at 
least in their appearance, could be 
detected. But when they took that 
wheat, which they had ground, sep- 
arated into its elements and put to- 
gether again, and planted it in the 
ground and nourished and nursed 
it, gave it to the sunlight and shade 
and water that it might grow, and 
watched it every day, it did not 
grow. Life was crushed out of it. 
It was made up of substances which 
made up the kernel of wheat as it 
comes from the field ; but by their 
handling it, by the grinding it and 
separating its elements, life was 
crushed and extinguished, and when 
they planted it that it might grow, 
it did not grow. It did not have 
within it that life-giving power. So 
I thought what a striking compar- 
ison it is with the religions, man- 
made doctrines in the world as com- 



pared with the doctrine of Jesus 
Christ. We do not wish to say any- 
thing against the religious denomin- 
ations of the world, as Elder Pen- 
rose stated this morning. We very 
cheerfully and gladly acknowledge 
all the good they do, and they do a 
great deal of good; but when it 
comes to having the truth, the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ which is, as 
Paul said, the "power of God unto 
salvation unto all that believe," they 
do not possess that. That life-giv- 
ing power is not within them. But 
in the gospel of Jesus Christ as we 
are blessed with having it revealed 
again direct from heaven, we have 
that life-principle ; it possesses that 
life-giving power unto salvation un- 
to all those that believe and obey it. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray 
that the Lord will bless the Latter- 
day Saints, that we may learn to un- 
derstand and appreciate, more and 
more, the truth as God has given it 
to us. While listening to Elder 
Brimhall this afternoon, I was re- 
minded of the testimony, or at least 
of the words, of a very wealthy 
lady whom I met on my last mission 
in the city of Berlin. An elder suc- 
ceeded in expounding and preach- 
ing the gospel unto her, and I heard 
her make the statement, more than 
once, "If I knew that this thing that 
you are preaching to me is of God, 
all my wealth and my possessions 
would be nothing to me. I would 
gladly forsake it all, if I only could 
believe, if I only knew as you know 
that it is the truth." Now, Latter- 
day Saints, we bear testimony that 
it is the truth. Let us feel, as this 
good woman did, that when we 
have the truth, all other things are 
secondary matters with us. The 
truth, the gospel, is the greatest 
and most important thing that we 
possess in this life, the only thing

which will bring us temporal and 
spiritual salvation. 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to be faithful, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORSON P. WHITNEY. 

Criticism of the Authorities— Presi- 
dent Kimball's Illustration.— Why 
Men and Women are Promoted. — 
The Lord has no Favorites.— Exhor- 
tation to Charity and Loyalty. 

Before we dismiss. I wish to 
thank this congregation for the 
unanimity of the vote given to sus- 
tain the General Authorities of the 
Church. My heart has been touched 
by the appreciative remarks that 
have been made, and I presume I 
am to be excused for feeling this 
way, owing to the position I occu- 
py. I am aware of the criticism 
and censure that are often ex- 
pressed toward men in authority. 
There seems to be a propensitv in 
the human heart that leads men to 
find fault with their fellows who are 
placed in high positions. President 
Heber C. Kimball once illustrated 
this propensity thus : while convers- 
ing with a friend, he stooped and 
picked from the ground a twig en- 
crusted with mud, for it had re- 
cently been raining, and holding it 
up, said, "As long as this little twig 
remained upon the ground it at- 
tracted no attention, although it had 
as much mud clinging to it then as 
now, but you did not notice it. 
When I lift it from the earth, how- 
ever, and hold it aloft, the mud is 
about all that vou can see ; it is 
with difficulty that you perceive the 
twig at all." 

This is human nature. It seems 
to demand from men in office great- 
ter virtues, greater qualities than 
other men possess, and is never 



weary of pointing out their imper- 
fections. Of course, men in office 
should strive to be exemplary, but 
if they are not perfect, it should 
occasion no surprise. Who are the 
men and women that have been se- 
lected to hold general authority in 
the Church, or authority in the 
stakes and wards? Who are the 
brethren and sisters vou have sus- 
tained this day? Thev are Mormon 
boys and girls, of no better ma- 
terial than you are ; yet some people 
seem to think a hign position ought 
to transform a man completely and 
convert him into an angel. 

Some imagine, too, that it makes 
every man proud to give him office 
and authority. I found very quick- 
ly, after being called into the quor- 
um of the Twelve, that I had to be 
far more careful to recognize peo- 
ple than ever before, lest they 
should charge me with being lifted 
up, with "having the big head," etc. 
T never dreamed of such a thing. 
It had never occurred to me that F 
could be given an office that would 
turn my head. I never received an 
honor that made me feel one par- 
ticle different toward my brethren 
and sisters. But some seem to think 
so. They are on the lookout for 
such things. They expect to be 
slighted ; they go half way to meet 
it; and think they have found what 
they were looking for. How easy 
it is to find fault. 

I don't believe God ever chose 
any man to hold an office in His 
Church, that he might shine for his 
own sake, or because he was any 
better, in a general way, than his- 
brethren around him. I believe 
there are just as good men down 
in the ranks as those who hold high 
positions. There are men serving 
as bishops, as high counselors, as 
stake presidents, who would honor 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



101 



the apostleship if called to it. The 
Lord does not give men and wom- 
en high office because they are His 
pets or* favorities, or because He 
wishes to honor them or their fam- 
ilies above the rest of the people. 
Rather is it because He can use 
them in those places better than 
anywhere else, for the general 
good. He needs bishops as well as 
apostles. He needs good, strong 
men out on the frontier as presi- 
dents' of stakes. All cannot be in 
the same place ; where a man is 
needed, there is his proper place, 
and we must go where we are sent, 
and come when we are called. 

And brethren and sisters, if your 
turn should come to preside, it 
would be our duty to sustain you. 
We are asking no more from you 
than you would expect from us. Our 
duties are not always pleasant. They 
are sometimes very painful. We 
have to do things that we would 
rather not do ; and we need the sus- 
taining power of your faith, and 
the help of the Lord at all times. I 
thank you again for your hearty 
vote and unanimity of expression, 
whereby you agreed and covenanted 
this day that you would sustain 
these men and women, not only by 
your uplifted hands, but by your 
faith and prayers and good works. 

Now go and do it. Don't pull 
down the authorities of the Church. 
Remember what you have done this 
day, and also bear in mind that your 
turn may come to stand in high 
and responsible places. Your turn 
may come to do things you would 
rather not do, but that you must do 
in order to be true to your cove- 
nants. We ask you to sustain us 
just as we would sustain you, were 
the positions reversed. 

May the Lord bless us all with 
the spirit of loyalty and love for 



each other, and for our brethren and 
sisters upon whom rest heavy and 
solemn responsibilities, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Hark ! ten thousand thousand voices 

Sing the song of jubilee! 
Earth, through all her tribes, rejoices — 

Broke her long captivity. 

Benediction was pronounced bv 
Elder Rodney C. Badger. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

Thousands of people gathered on 
the Temple grounds, unable to ob- 
tain admission to the Tabernacle or 
Assembly Hall, and an outdoor 
meeting was held for their benefit, 
near the Bureau of Information 
building. Elder Benjamin Goddard 
presided, and Elder Melvin J. Bal- 
lard led the singing; Wanda Czap- 
iensky and Agnes Clive accom- 
panied on the organ. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled ; 
Ye nations, now look up. 

It waves to all the world. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Samuel H. Allen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"America." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 

It must be a great satisfaction to 
the Latter-day Saints to observe the 
attendance at this conference, and 
the earnest desire of the members 
of the Church to obtain admission 
into our dedicated buildings. We 
rejoice, however, in the good weath- 
er that enables us to meet here in 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"God's own temple" to worship 
Him and to receive such instruc- 
tions as He may inspire His ser- 
vants to give. 

We are pleased to be here. We 
rejoice in the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and in the opportunity 
we have of bearing our testimony 
unto its truth. I presume the ma- 
jority present are members of the 
Church, and you rejoice in the or- 
ganization thereof, that God has 
given us, in these days, "apostles, 
prophets, evangelists, pastors, and 
teachers," to lead us unto a knowl- 
edge of Him, to bring us unto a 
"unity of the faith." 

We rejoice in meeting so many 
who have come from distant stakes 
of Zion. These presidents of mis- 
sions who are here undoubtedly 
think of the thousands of elders 
now abroad, who are not privileged 
to meet with us. I trust that your 
hearts are going out to God in 
prayer that He will bless His mis- 
sionary servants and handmaidens, 
who are carrying the warning mes- 
sage to the people of every clime. 

You have joined in singing our 
national anthem, but I venture to 
say that none of you have sung it 
more fervently nor with more loyal 
spirit than our elders, who are now 
in the nations of the earth, sing it 
from time to time. I refer partic- 
ularly to the second verse, and draw 
your attention to it, because we may 
at times sing it with our lips with- 
out reflecting upon the sentiment 
contained in the song. I take the 
liberty, therefore, of drawing at- 
tention to the verse named, which 
I think, reflects the thoughts, senti- 
ments, and devotion to fatherland 
of our missionary representatives 
especially. 

"My native country thee, 
Land of the noble free, 
Thy name I love. 



I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills, 
My heart with rapture thrills. 
Like that above." 

• 

I trust we shall remember the ab- 
sent ones, and that you who are 
present will enjoy in very deed the 
spirit of this meeting. 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in this privilege of standing be- 
fore you this afternoon, and I trust 
that during the few moments I oc- 
cupy this position, I may be blessed 
of the Lord, that what I say will be 
for our mutual benefit and good. 

I am absolutely converted to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, for I know, 
as did Paul, that it is "the power of 
God unto salvation." As I look 
today through these trees, across 
the grounds, I cannot help but think 
of the statements made by Christ 
the Lord when Ho. said, "Judge a 
tree by its fruit, for a good tree 
cannot bring forth corrupt fruit ; 
neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit," and "By their 
fruit ye shall know them." 

As we were singing the hymns, 
in the opening exercises of our out- 
door meeting, my thoughts were 
drifting back over the history of 
this Church, and back into the mis- 
sion field. I thought of the great 
modern Moses, Brigham Young, 
who led this people into the valleys 
of the mountains. Many that knew 
Brigham Young are undoubtedly on 
the grounds today, who heard him 
speak under the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit of God, who remember 
the impress his remarks have made 
upon them all the days of their lives. 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION. 



1 have read his sermons, and have 
listened to men who have heard 
him, and, when I see this vast con- 
gregation, I cannot help but cite 
the world to these valleys of the 
mountains, to this people, and ask if 
such a people as the Latter-day 
Saints could be the wicked people 
that our enemies represent them to 
be? 

I am proud, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to have the privilege of labor- 
ing in the ministry of our Savior. 
If there is one man under the sun 
that I can, through my ministry, 
reach, that will go down into the 
waters of baptism and become a 
convert to the principles and doc- 
trines of the Church of Christ, Yield- 
ing obedience to the call of the au- 
thority Jesus has conferred, I shall 
be well repaid. 

I know that in the country outside 
of the valleys of the mountains, 
wherever I travel. I find men and 
women, who in their hearts are sin- 
cere, who have a desire to serve the 
Lord ; and just as soon as that blind 
prejudice can be removed, which 
has been so strongly established in 
the hearts of men by the enemies 
of God, just as soon will many be 
converted and go down into the wa- 
ters of baptism. An honest man or 
honest woman cannot study the 
principles of Christ's gospel, as 
taught by the Mormon people, 
without it having some effect upon 
them. It will act as oil upon the 
waters, and will lead them into a 
condition whereby they will forsake 
their sins, turn unto the Lord, and 
acknowledge Him and His power to 
save ; for all men desire to be saved 
in the kingdom of our God. Just 
as soon as honest hearted people 
become acquainted with the straight 
and narrow way they go in thereat, 
bv hundreds and thousands. 



The Mormon people are making 
friends in the earth everywhere. It 
is a mistake for our enemies to do 
as they are doing, thinking that they 
are going to lead away from the 
path of rectitude the men and wom- 
en in this country who dare to do 
right, and who love the truth. The 
reports that are sent out by enemies, 
concerning the Mormon people in 
these valleys of the mountains, are 
causing more investigations than 
anything they have ever done yet, 
for thinking people are investigat- 
ing these reports. There was a time, 
perhaps, when all people might be 
easily misled concerning the Mor- 
mon people; but that day is past, 
for honorable men and women in 
the earth will investigate and see for 
themselves what the real status is of 
the great people out in this western 
land, that have builded such com- 
monwealths as the world has scarce- 
ly ever known, and which com- 
mands the respect of informed men 
and women everywhere. 

"And by their fruits," the Savior 
said, "ye shall know them," and by 
the fruits of the labor of the Mor- 
mon people, their establishment of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ through- 
out this world, will people be led to 
yield obedience to the principles that 
give them the power to excel in 
temporal and spiritual things. Not 
only in the stakes of Zion is this 
the case, but everywhere where this 
gospel goes. You will find in every 
little hamlet or village — where a 
Latter-day Saint is, that he begins 
to make friends around him by 
teaching his neighbor what he be- 
lieves is right. As the mission- 
aries go through the country es- 
tablishing colonies and branches of 
the Church, they introduce the var- 
ious auxiliary organizations as they 
are established in the Church here

at home, which also teaches the con- 
verts organization and order. 

Down in the Central States Mis- 
sion we have a great many branches 
of the Church, some of them quite 
large, and we have introduced 
among them our different auxili- 
ary organizations, that they may 
thus harmonize with us at home. 

Brigham Young established in 
this country a great school system, 
which has commanded the respect 
of everyone that has investigated it, 
and this system is taught wherever 
the Mormon people go. We have 
elders who are teaching school in 
the Central States Mission. They 
are teaching day school as well a 
assisting in the branch work ; and 
many of" the saints are asking that 
a night or two a week be set apart 
that they might attend a night 
school, and thus become acquainted 
with the educational plans of the 
Mormon people. We are endeavor- 
ing to do this everywhere. One 
writer has said that the greatest 
prison is that of inefficiency. Teach 
efficiency, and you release the cap- 
tives. I say to you that men and 
women everywhere delight in prin- 
ciples of education and right. They 
love liberty just as much in any 
part of the world, wherever this 
gospel goes, .as we do here ; because 
it carries with it liberty and loyalty, 
honor to God and to the nation in 
which they reside. 

Over in the State of Texas we 
have a colonv of six hundred peo- 
ple, perhaps more, and in that col- 
ony we have a day school, taught by 
our missionaries from this city, whc 
have been called to go there, giving 
their time and attention toward the 
uplifting of manhood. We believe 
that when a man goes down in the 
waters of baptism he has the right 
to receive all that the Church has 



for him, all that God has revealed 
for men to receive. We believe that 
it is right for each and every one of 
us to receive these privileges if we 
live faithful and true to our cove- 
nants, consequently the principle of 
establishing schools has prevailed 
wherever the Mormon Church has 
gained converts. The teachers wh > 
were called to this particular labor 
in Texas happen to be lady mis- 
sionaries. They have, perhaps, one 
hundred and fifty pupils divided 
among three of them. They nave a 
Sabbath School numbering over t wo 
hundred and fifty pupils. One night 
weekly they teach forty officers and 
teachers of that Sabbath School how 
to instruct the members of that 
school, thus giving them training ; 
and they are doing many other 
things toward the benefit and up- 
lifting of these people. 

I say unto you, my brothers and 
sisters, that there never was a time 
in the world when the people were 
receiving Mormonism better than at 
the present. Our ciders are re- 
ceived almost everywhere with open 
arms. The eyes of the nations are 
upon the Mormons, and when peo- 
ple investigate the principles of our 
Church, the principles of right, lib- 
erty, love, and justice which we 
teach, they hasten their desire to 
find out more. Consequently, 1 say, 
none of us need have any fear as to 
the outcome of this work. The el- 
ders that have been sent forth into 
the missionary fields of this Church 
are bringing souls to God every 
day ; honest hearted men and wom- 
en, children of the same God, are 
yielding obedience to the principles 
that were taught by Christ the Lord 
and revealed to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

There was a time in the history 
of this Church when people scoffed 



ELDER C. IV. SORENSON.

if you mentioned the name of Jo- 
seph Smith in the streets, or in pub- 
lic places of any kind, but that day 
is past. I am a witness of it, and 
know that when the name of Jo- 
seph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, 
is now preached or mentioned upon 
the streets or in halls of cities, ham- 
lets, or villages, people listen to 
what we have to say concerning him 
with interest. We have established 
a history that is going to be pro- 
claimed forever and ever, for God 
Himself will not recall what He has 
spoken. The history that has been 
made by the actual experience of 
the Mormon Church will be estab- 
lished in the earth. When people 
know that we love liberty, honor, 
truth and justice, and that, above all 
people in the world, we are loyal to 
each other, to this nation, and to 
God, vacancies will be caused in the 
synagogues and churches, and other 
places occupied by men who claim 
to have the authority to teach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, for truth 
will prevail. The Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the authority accom- 
panying it, comes unto us by reve- 
lation, and it comes in no other 
way. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, 
that the gospel is true. I know 
this : that God the Father and His 
Son appeared unto the Prophet Jo- 
se] ill Smith, over in the western 
portion of the State of New York, 
in that grove, I know this just as 
well as I know that I am standing 
here. That testimony can never be 
taken from me, because it has been 
gained by actual experience, it is a 
knowledge which comes through 
faith and work, and through fidel- 
ity to the cause of God on this 
earth. 

I ask the Lord to bless us in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER C. W. SORENSON. 

(Of North Sanpete Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters: one of 
the very strong testimonies, in my 
opinion, of the work in which we 
are engaged, is this large concourse 
of people, who assemble here at 
least twice every year. It is an as- 
tnishing fact that twice a year, the 
converts of Mormonism come from 
Mexico on the south, from Canada 
on the north, from the Atlantic and 
the Pacific coasts. From thousands 
of miles distant the people assem- 
ble from year to year semi-annua!lv 
to hear the word of God as it is 
dispensed from the headquarters of 
the Mormon Church. Where in all 
the world can you find a spectacle 
like it? 

I want to ask what is it that 
moves upon the children of men to 
bring them thus together. By what 
power, by what affinities, are they 
thus attracted ; by what power are 
they made to meet the sacrifices 
which it takes, not only in time, but 
in means, to gather in such large 
numbers upon such occasions? 

We heard yesterday from one of 
the speakers in the Tabernacle that 
some one had said that we were 
very lath, in fact afraid, to stand 
up by the side of the scriptures, that 
we were afraid to have our ideas 
and doctrines investigated in the 
light of the revelations of God, as 
contained in Holy Writ, particu- 
larly in the Bible. I say to you, 
as an elder in Israel, and I do not 
need to tell it to those of us who 
have embraced the truth and have 
knowledge of it, but, should there 
be any here who are not converted 
to the doctrines of Mormonism— I 
want to say to you that nothing is 
farther from the truth than that. I 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



know there is nothing- that I like 
better, that pleases me more, than 
the privilege of lining up the prin- 
ciples of Mormonism with the Holy 
Scriptures, the Bible. There is noth- 
ing I like better than to demonstrate 
the truth of the principles enunciat- 
ed by our Prophet in the light of 
the revelations contained in the 
Word of God. I bear testimony to 
you today that Mormonism, as it 
was enunciated by the Prophet, and 
as it has been taught from that day 
to this, as it is proclaimed bv us 
throughout the length and the 
breadth of the world today, is noth- 
ing more, is nothing less, than the 
doctrines laid down in the Word of 
God ; is nothing more nor less than 
the preaching and teachings of the 
prophets of all ages since the world 
began. I repeat, it is an especial 
pleasure to any missionary to com- 
pare the doctrines of Mormonism. 
so called, with the doctrines taught 
in the Bible. 

It is conceded that we have one 
of the most wonderful organiza- 
tions in the world. It has been said 
that it is second only to the German 
army, and while we are pleased with 
that comparison, we are willing to 
go them one better, and say, not 
even the German army can compare 
with the organization of our 
Church. It is organized by and 
under the direction of Almighty 
God, and it is perfect in all its ram- 
ifications. If there is a defect, or 
fault, I bear testimony that it is not 
because of a faulty organization, 
but because of faults in the men or 
women occupying offices in the or- 
ganization. I emphatically declare 
unto you, therefore, that Mormon- 
ism is what the Bible teaches. I 
declare unto you that the Church, 
commonly known as the Mormon 
Church, is none other than the 



Church of God, in complete har- 
mony with that system instituted 
and organized by the Savior of the 
world. 

But even these things are not all 
that has brought this vast concourse 
of people together. There is some- 
thing else. We explain to the world 
the doctrines of Mormonism; we 
show to the world the wonderful 
organization of the Church, but this 
other element, the most vital con- 
tent of this system, we cannot ex- 
plain to them, although we know it. 
Every man that has been imbued 
with the Spirit of God understands 
it. He cannot give it to another — 
that is, he cannot give to another 
that feeling and those emotions that 
come to himself who knows it. He 
alone understands it and feels it. 
What is it? It is the spirit that 
permeates this work. It is but na- 
tural that this work, being the work 
of God, should be imbued with the 
Spirit of God. It is but natural that 
it should be permeated by that Spir- 
it. The Spirit of God is given to 
every penitent sinner when he has 
received baptism at the hands of 
those having authority. The Spir- 
it thus bestowed upon him, bv the 
authority of God, becomes to him 
an assurance and testimony, and 
living fire within him, by which he 
knows, understands and feels that 
this is the kingdom of God. We 
cannot give that to the investigator. 
He can receive it only as God is 
pleased to give it to him, and God 
is pleased to give it only to those 
who, in penitence and humility, bow 
before him and receive and obey 
His word. 

I want to call your attention to 
the operations of that Spirit. You 
may feel it, but it is like the Savior 
said: "The wind bloweth : but 
whither it cometh we know not. 



ELDER C. W. SORENSON. 



107 



nor whither it goeth." The influ- 
ence is there, the feeling is there, 
the emotions are there ;and every 
man or woman who honestly obeys 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus re- 
ceives that Spirit, and that testi- 
mony. 

That to me is the strongest testi- 
mony of this work. When all oth- 
er things fail, when doubt and mis- 
givings arise concerning this man 
or that man, there need never be 
a failure of the testimony of the 
Spirit of Truth, if the person is 
living so he is worthy of it. Men 
may judge the system, men may 
judge the doctrine, but none can 
judge the truth except he who is 
under the influence of the Spirit 
of Truth, and whose soul has been 
mellowed by its wonderful power. 
It is the same spirit that has moved 
upon the divine teachers, sages and 
prophets of all ages. 

I often think of that man Colum- 
bus. When he was westward bound 
across the mighty deep, when his 
men were dissatisfied, and mutinied 
and decided to cast him overboard 
unless he would listen to them and 
turn back, with death staring him 
in the face, with angry and deter- 
mined men threatening him — I 
wonder that he could continue to 
plead with them for more time. Im- 
agine how he felt on the third day, 
when the time was lapsing, when 
before him was apparently nothing 
but disappointment or a watery 
grave. Did he falter? Did he show 
timidity, or a laxity of faith in the 
object of his research? Not for 
one moment! Now I want to ask 
you, my friends, my brethren and 
sisters, what was it that moved up- 
on him? Undoubtedly it was the 
Spirit of God. Somehow, he knew 
that success would yet perch upon 
his banner. Somehow, he under- 



stood that his efforts would ter- 
minate in success. Could he prove 
or demonstrate that feeling? No. 
but he could feel it, and I say to 
you, that even as he felt and under- 
stood his success before it was 
achieved, so do we know that this 
is the work of God. The same 
spirit that urged him on in the face 
of adversity and a watery grave, 
the same is that which actuates 
our boys when they go out in the 
mission field and come in contact 
with men of wisdom and learning 
and understanding. They are in- 
spired with something within, and 
they are undaunted, courageous, 
and unfearing. 

This feeling that brings yon up 
from Arizona and Mexico on the 
south, and Canada on the north, 
from the Atlantic States, from all 
over the world, is the Spirit that 
moves upon the hearts of men and 
women in every nation under the 
whole heaven, where this gospel is 
preached, to turn their thoughts to 
this city on the sixth day of April 
and on the sixth day of October, 
and anticipate with deep concern 
and profound anxiety the utter- 
ances made from these pulpits up- 
on these occasions. I say it is the 
Spirit of God moving upon them, 
and it is moving upon you. 

Brethren and sisters, I bear my 
testimony to you. I understand a 
part of this doctrine, and as I un- 
derstand it, I believe that it is true : 
I may say I know that it is true. I 
am not ashamed of it, because I 
know it to be the power of God un- 
to salvation. 

May God grant that we may be 
faithful and true to this cause, that 
we may not be unworthy of it, and 
that our Father in heaven may nev- 
er have cause to be ashamed of us, 
either individually or collectively.

is the prayer of your humble ser- 
vant, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Prof. William C. Clive rendered 
a violin solo, "Berceuse." 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, in lis- 
tening to the testimony of President 
Joseph F. Smith at the beginning 
of our conference, I was impressed 
with the strength of the same ; and 
my mind went back over his life. I 
thought of how the Lord had pre- 
pared him to do the work that he 
lias done during his life-time, and 
the labors that he is now doing and 
how he had been prepared to bear 
the powerful testimony that he gave 
to the Latter-day Saints concerning 
Christ, and the gospel that has been 
established in the earth. 

T was reminded of Joseph who 
was sold into Egypt as a bov, how 
lie was isolated from his parents, 
and how he grew up in a foreign 
land, and yet God prepared him to 
save His people. Following my 
thought of Joseph who was sold in- 
to Egvpt, I remembered the lonely 
life of John the Baptist, and how 
God prepared him for his life work. 
Our Heavenly Father gave his 
mother a witness of the mission 
that he would perform in the earth, 
and no doubt, as other mothers 
teach their sons, this mother taught 
her son the mission that he would 
have to perform. 

Following John the Baptist. T re- 
membered the life of Christ and 
the fore-knowledge of his mother. 
Earlv in life Testis declared to His 
mother, and to the world, that He 
"must be about His Father's busi- 
ness." While we have little knowl- 



edge of His life after that until He 
began His great ministry in the 
earth, there is no doubt that on 
many occasions He had revealed to 
Him, in harmony with His mother's 
teachings, that He was indeed the 
Son of God. which prepared Him 
to know what He was about when 
He went to John the Baptist and 
asked for baptism, and to know the 
mission that He had to perform in 
the earth. Being thus early pre- 
pared. He was strengthened for the 
great labors devolving upon Him in 
doing His Father's will. 

As in days of old. our Father 
took Joseph Smith, as a bov and 
prepared him for his life's mission. 
T have often told the people what a 
wonderful thing it was for Joseph 
Smith to believe in the things he 
taught to the world. How wonder- 
ful it would be to the voting men 
in the world if they believed, as 
Joseph Smith did. that the heavens 
had been opened and that God had 
spoken to them. Instead of spend- 
ing their lives from fourteen to 
eighteen in foolish play, it would 
settle them in their life's mis- 
sion. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
was so settled when, from the age 
of fourteen to eighteen the weight 
of his mission rested upon him, and 
he prayed. "< ), Father, I can stand 
this no longer." In answer to that 
prayer, an angel came with addi- 
tional light, with more evidence 
concerning the great work he was 
to perform. Although everv addi- 
tional thing that our Father impart- 
ed to him increased the responsibil- 
itv. he was prepared for his life's 
labor. 

It has given me a great deal of 
joy, to visit the noted places in 
Church history. When I visited the 
home of the Prophet Toseph Smith 
and took into account that he was a 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



humble boy, who had never prayed 
in public in his life, I felt that I 
could sympathize with him, as he 
went seeking a secluded place where 
he could talk to his Father alone. 
In listening to many ministers at a 
revival he was convinced in his 
heart that some of the churches 
were wrong, and desired in his soul 
to know which one was right. He 
sought a place that he might ask 
his Father in heaven concerning 
these things. Leaving the house, 
he crossed the road and passed 
through the barn down to the little 
meadow and across the creek into 
the wood, three hundred yards from 
the house. In the seclusion of that 
grove he knelt down and supplicat- 
ed his God to know which of all 
the churches was right. Answer- 
ing the humble petition, our Father 
in heaven manifested Himself unto 
him, together with His Son, Jesus 
Christ, and thus the last dispensa- 
tion of the gospel was ushered in. 
I have wished that hundreds of the 
young men in Zion at the early 
age of fourteen years, could have 
some such experience come into 
their lives to settle them in their 
mission in the earth. It has been 
my privilege to labor with a thou- 
sand young men in the Northern 
States Mission. They are good, 
clean, honest boys, but they have 
not in their lives a conviction so 
settled and a purpose so fixed as 
had the Prophet Joseph Smith. If 
they had half the faith that Joseph 
Smith possessed at fourteen years 
of age, they would be greater and 
more powerful missionaries than 
they are today. Yet, after they 
have been there a while, and under- 
go a few trials and some persecu- 
tions, be turned away without a bed 
and hungry, they find that God is 
their only friend, and a portion of 



the spirit that filled the Prophet 
Joseph Smith comes upon these el- 
ders. Before two years are over, 
they, too, are powerful in their 
ministrations under the influence of 
the Spirit of God, in their declara- 
tion to the world that our Father 
has established His Church and 
kingdom in the earth. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, as a 
boy of fourteen, knew beyond ques- 
tion or doubt that God lives, and 
that Jesus Christ was the Son of 
God, for the Father made it known 
unto him in his youth and it con- 
tinued with him all the days of his 
life. 

We often hear that God estab- 
lished this latter-day work through 
the boy-Prophet Joseph Smith. He 
was a boy in years, but not a boy 
in experience. Our Father in heav- 
en took Joseph Smith as a boy and 
gave him the greatest lesson that 
has been given to man since Jesus 
Christ was upon the earth. It so 
impressed his life, and weighed so 
much upon his mind, that he de- 
clared, "I can stand the power and 
influence of this lesson no longer." 
Continuing his education God sent 
angels to him, and year by year 
schooled him until he was about 
twenty-four years of age. He then 
brought him out of that school a 
post-graduate, as it were, in the 
knowledge of God and the things 
of God. He had little knowledge 
concerning the affairs of men in 
the earth, and in order to fill the 
great mission to which he had been 
called he had to follow the com- 
mands of God. 

So Joseph Smith, taught of God, 
prepared of our Father, learned of 
Him, established this work, no 
longer a boy but a man, and a 
Prophet in . his knowledge of the 
things of God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



As before remarked, I have often 
wished that our sons and daugh- 
ters, the young men and young 
women of Zion could have a sim- 
ilar impress in their lives, so that, 
instead of wasting much of their 
time in frivolity, they could feel a 
portion of the responsibility that Jo- 
seph Smith felt. We have a mis- 
sion in the earth and ought to be 
well prepared to deliver to men this 
message that our Father has com- 
mitted unto us. It is our mission 
to preach Christ and Him crucified. 
It is our mission to proclaim to the 
world that the heavens have been 
opened and the gospel message de- 
livered anew to mankind for their 
salvation. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in the life of Joseph Smith and 
how God prepared him for his great 
mission in the world. He prepared 
in a similar manner Joseph of old. 
He prepared John the Baptist, He 
gave to His only begotten Son the 
knowledge of who He was, and 
reared Him under that influence to 
be the Redeemer of the world. He 
prepared Joseph Smith also, to per- 
form a great mission in these last 
days, prepared him as an instru- 
ment to establish the Church and 
kingdom of our Father. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints we rejoice in the 
great truths that God has given to 
us through the humble boy Joseph 
Smith. We feel that they have 
come from our Father. In ming- 
ling together in general confer- 
ence we build up our faith in God 
and go home congratulating each 
other that we are members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

True, my brethren and sisters, 
we are called upon, as other peoples 
have been, to make sacrifice for this 
great work. We call it a sacrifice, 



but I wonder if any of us begrudge 
the labors we have done, if any of 
us would recall the time and means 
we have expended in declaring to 
the world this message of glad tid- 
ings. I would not. I feel that I 
have been paid many times over for 
the time and all the means that I 
have expended in preaching to the 
world this glorious message. I love 
the world and the men and wom- 
en in it who love truth and right- 
eousness. There are thousands of 
them, and when their eyes are op- 
ened and they understand, as we 
understand, they will be just as eag- 
er as we to do the will of the 
Father. Sometimes I wonder if 
they, with their education and learn- 
ing, should embrace the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, if the young 
men of Zion would not lose their 
place, while those now outside 
become teachers of the people of 
Zion. I sometimes feel that the 
young men and young women of 
Zion have too easy a life. Mother 
and father have killed the snakes, 
grubbed the brush, dug the ditches, 
and now we are basking in the sun- 
shine, and enjoying the luxuries 
that they have prepared for us, in- 
stead of bumping against the hard 
things of the world and preparing 
ourselves for our life's mission, as 
they prepared themselves. 

Joseph who was sold into Egypt 
felt his isolation and loneliness, no 
doubt John the Baptist felt his iso- 
lation ; and the Savior of the world, 
as he stood among those wise men, 
at twelve years of age, felt how- 
lonely He was. I am sure after He 
had His great temptation and the 
angels of our Father came and ad- 
ministered to Him, He felt com- 
forted in His great loneliness. I 
am sure the Prophet Joseph Smith 
felt greatly relieved when he took 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



Ill 



the three witnesses into the woods 
and there had the privilege of shar- 
ing with them the great burden that 
he had been carrying alone. Again, 
in the manifestations in Kirtland 
Temple, I am sure his heart re- 
joiced when he was able to share a 
portion of the burden that had been 
resting upon him for years. Lin- 
coln, and Washington, and other 
great men in this world have felt 
the responsibility of their life's mis- 
sion, and at times experienced lone- 
liness, but it prepared them to do 
the great work they each have done 
in life. 

Now, I am reminded of our pres- 
ent President of the Church, how, 
as a boy, he crossed these plains 
with a widowed mother ; how, as a 
boy, he was under the benign influ- 
ence of that saddened though strong 
hearted mother, a mother who as- 
sumed in full the responsbilitv she 
owed to her children. As a bov he 
must have felt sometimes that all 
things were against him ; yet he 
cheerfully responded when sent to 
the Sandwich Islands on a mission 
at the tender age of fifteen, to de- 
clare the truths that had left him 
without a father's care. I feel sure 
that the hard experiences he had in 
early life helped to mould his char- 
acter, therefore it is no wonder he 
speaks to us today in power and de- 
clares, with a testimony that goes 
to the heart of every man and wom- 
an honest in soul, that God lives 
and that Jesus is the Christ. 

As I have said, my brethren and 
sisters, our Father has prepared 
men in their youth, throughout all 
the world, to do the great work 
they accomplished in after years. 
Take Samuel the Prophet, King 
David, and hundreds of others that 
our Father has used ; He has pre- 
pared them early in life, and told 



them what their mission would be. 
Now, the young men and voung 
women of the Latter-day Saints, 
through the teaching of their moth- 
ers and fathers, ought to know what 
their life's mission is, and prepare 
in seriousness, early in life to car- 
ry to the world the great message, 
that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that His gospel has been 
established in the last days for the 
salvation of the children of men. 
If we, as His chosen people in this 
day, as His favored people, with 
this glorious testimony, do not do 
the work that rests upon us, our 
Father will raise up sons and 
daughters who will do it in an ac- 
ceptable manner before Him ! 

I believe the Latter-day Saints, 
as a whole, realize their great mis- 
sion, and are preparing themselves 
and their children to do this work ; 
but, although the missionaries that 
come to us in the Northern States 
are good young men, I find that 
many of them have had life too 
easy, they have not felt responsibil- 
ity enough at home. Few of them 
have preached much, if any at 
home. Few of them have done 
enough in family worship in their 
homes. I think that we should add 
a little more responsibility to our 
sons and daughters, and give them 
just a little more practical religion 
in the tender years of their life. 
We ought to put our arms around 
them and impress upon them like 
Mary did upon her son, His life's 
mission; like Elizabeth impressed 
upon her son, the mission he was 
to perform, and like the mother of 
the Prophet Joseph F. Smith im- 
pressed upon her son what his life's 
mission was. He has been schooled

hood, and no wonder his testimony 
thrills the Latter-day Saints. We

ought to heed his counsel, and walk 
uprightly as he does. We ought to 
follow the commandments the Lord 
gives through him, and bless God 
for his example, his character, and 
his testimony to us that God lives 
and that Jesus is the Christ. 

May our Father help us, and pre- 
pare us for the great mission to de- 
clare to the world, that God our 
Father lives, that Jesus Christ is 
His Son, and that He has estab- 
lished His work in the earth, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard sang the 
favorite missionary hymn, "I will 
go where you want me to go." 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

( President of Western States Mission.) 

"For God so loved the world that 
He gave His only begotten Son that 
they who believe on Him might not 
perish, but have everlasting life." 

One of the testimonies that I have 
gained in the church is that we are 
prepared to sacrifice all ties for the 
good of God's work. When God 
gave His only begotten Son it seems 
that He has demanded, not only 
since that time but in all ages and 
dispensations when the gospel has 
been upon the earth, that those who 
love Him must be ready to die as 
He has done, if necessary — sacrifice 
that which is near and dear to them. 
In olden times, you will recall, Abra- 
ham was called upon to offer up his 
son. In that time it seemed some 
outward sacrifice was demanded. 
People had to burn sacrifice, they 
had to burn beasts and fowls. But 
in the meridian of time, when the 
Savior came and when He re- 



deemed mankind by giving His life,, 
the divine command for that kind 
of sacrifice was fulfilled, they were 
no longer demanded. However, the 
kind of sacrifice that we have to> 
give is none the less important. 

When the Savior came and the 
rich man asked him what he should 
do that he might inherit eternal life, 
he was told some of the command- 
ments that had been given before. 
But he said, "All these have I kept 
from my youth up." Then Jesus 
said to him, "Sell that thou hast 
and give to the poor and come and 
follow me." That was the sacrifice 
demanded of him, but he could not 
make that sacrifice, he could not live- 
that life. That was the principle that 
was taught during the time the 
Savior was upon the earth, and 
when He dispensed blessings that 
have come to us — to every one that 
came within His radius. 

In this day, when the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was made the instru- 
ment to bring forth this latter-day 
work, he began to make sacrifice 
from the moment that the vision was 
opened up to him, and in every 
move he made and everything he 
did, not only in his life but in the 
lives of his people sacrifice was de- 
manded. You may recall that in 
the year 1835. when Zion's Camp 
was called together, after they had 
been out into the West, those men 
who had been called forth to give 
their lives, if need be, for this work, 
they were assembled for the great 
purpose of choosing the twelve 
apostles in the church, the first 
twelve apostles and also the 
first seventy, upon whom devolved 
the responsibility of spreading the 
gospel to the world. And when 
they were met together, the Proph- 
et said to them, "Some of you are 
angry with me because I would not

let you fight when you wanted to. 
God did not want us to fight, but 
He wanted us to live our lives as 
He had directed. It is His will 
that those who are chosen to be 
the first twelve apostles to the world 
and the first quorum of seventy 
should be chosen from Zion's 
Camp, from among the men who 
had been ready to give sacrifice, 
even such as Abraham of old." 
That is how these men were chosen 
— by revelation ; they had to be men 
of that character, men who were 
ready, not only to give their own 
lives but the lives of those who 
were near and dear to them. A 
man's own life is not dear to him 
sometimes, if it comes to a question 
of those he loves. My life would 
not be much to me, if I could give 
it for one of my children. When 
men have been ready to sacrifice 
all that they had in the world, that 
is the kind of men God has required 
since the beginning to take charge 
of His work. And so men have 
gone forth, leaving their wives and 
their families, even in destitute cir- 
cumstances. What for? To go 
and preach the gospel to those who 
were in darkness. So today, my 
brethren and sisters, you parents 
who are here today, you young men 
who have been in the mission field 
and you who are candidates to go, 
we have it in our hearts to do the 
same bidding, to go and do Christ's 
service, to preach His word, to do 
His will and follow the direction of 
those who are placed over us in this 
church. We cannot know, we can- 
not appreciate, the blessings that 
shall come to us, unless we taste 
some of the bitterness of life. We 
cannot know how to appreciate the 
sweet unless the bitter comes into 
our lives. So it is with us in every- 
thing we do. 



The lines of a poet come to my 
mind, which exemplify the position 
of the Latter-day Saints. We have 
to suffer in order to be blessed, and 
when we realize this one thing, it 
is a wonderful consolation for us in 
our lives. 

"All wondering and eager-eyed, 

Within her portico, 
I made my plea of Hostess Life, 

One morning long ago. 
'Pray, show me this great house of 
thine, 

Xor close a single door, 

For many rooms and curious things 
And treasures great and small. 

Within this spacious mansion lie. 
And I would see them all.' 

Then Hostess Life turned silently 
Her searching gaze on me, 

And with no word she reached her 
hand, 

And offered up the key. 

It opened first the Door of Hope. 

And long I lingered there, 
Until I soied the Room of Dreams, 

Just higher by a stair, 
And then a door, whereon the word 

'Hapoiness' was writ, 
But when I tried the little key, 

I could not make it fit. 

It unlocked the door of 'Pleasure's 
Room,' 

Where ev'rything seemed so bright, 
But after I had stayed a while, 

It somehow lost its light; 
And wandering down the little hall, 

I came upon a room 
Marked 'Duty,' and entered it 

To find myself in gloom. 

Along its shadowy walls I groned 

My weary way about, 
And found that from dull Duty's Room 

The door of toil led out. 
It led out into another room, 

Whereon a crimson stain, 
Marked sullenly against the dark. 

The words, 'The Room of Pain.' 

But oh! the light, the light, the light! 

That spilled down from above! 
And upward wound the stairs of Fairh, 

Right to the Tower of Love. 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And when I came forth from that 
place, 

I tried the little key, 
And lo! the Door of Happiness 

Swung open wide and free." 

And so with you, my friends, you 
who are ready to sacrifice and send 
your sons and daughters into the 
world to preach the gospel you may 
rest assured, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that when the time of reck- 
oning shall come that the Lord shall 
count you among His worthy chil- 
dren. He shall account your sons 
and daughters blessed and when you 
shall leave this earth, and shall join 
together with each other in the 
family circle, God shall call you 
blessed, because you have seen fit 
to worship Him in spirit and in 
truth while you have been upon the 
earth. 

My testimony to you is that this 
work is true, that God's directing 
hand is over it, that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God and that ev- 
erything that has been done since 
the inception of this work has been 
guided and directed by a supreme 
hand, a hand that shall continue to 
guide and direct this work so long 
as the world shall last. May God 
bless us all I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet. 

To guide us in these latter days ; 
Wc thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder F. R. Lyman.

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Positive character of testimony de- 
clared by Latter-day Saints. — A 
Christian minister's scathing ar- 
raignment of modern churches. — 
Divinity of Mormonism evidenced 
by Saints possessing Holy Ghost. — 
Spiritual gifts manifest in true 
Church today as in olden times. 

I earnestly desire that I may have 
the sympathy, the faith, and the 
prayers of this vast multitude of 
Latter-day Saints to assist me in 
speaking to you, this afternoon. 

I have had very many reflections, 
during this conference, while listen- 
ing to the remarks w hich have been 
made. From the opening address 
of our President to the last speech 
I have thoroughly enjoyed all that 
has been said, and it meets with my 
hearty endorsement. I rejoice that 
I am a member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I appreciate this privilege, far be- 
yond any ability with which I am 
possessed to express my feelings. 
To know that I am associated with 
the truth, to know that this gospel 
that you and I have espoused is in 
very deed the plan of life and sal- 
vation ; this gives to me a peace, a 
satisfaction, and a joy beyond ex- 
pression. I have not the ability to 
express the joy and the deep grati- 
tude to my heavenly Father that fills 
my heart, for the knowledge that 
1 le has given to me of the divinity 



of the work in which we are en- 
gaged. 

I was particularly impressed with 
the remarks made here today by 
Brother Hyrum M. Smith, and by 
those of Brother B. H. Roberts. If 
the glorious principles enunciated by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith are, in 
very deed, true, it does seem to me 
that every individual who has re- 
ceived a knowledge of them, should 
make up his mind that by and with 
the help of the Lord he will, in very 
deed, seek first the kingdom, so that 
all of the necessary things of life 
will be added unto him. 

Realizing that I would, undoubt- 
edly, be asked to speak here this 
afternoon, I was thinking, while 
coming from my home, on what 
theme I might be able to interest the 
people. I remembered reading from 
the Brief History of the Church, by 
Edward H. Anderson, a footnote, 
some years ago, when I delivered a 
sermon in San Francisco, while 
there with the choir. I stopped at 
the Bureau of Information and got 
the history, so that I could read it 
to you here. It is said that Roge* - 
Williams refused to continue is pas- 
tor over the largest Baptist church 
in this country, because there was — 
I now quote his language — "no reg- 
ularly constituted church on earth, 
nor any person authorized to ad- 
minister any church ordinance ; nor 
can there be until new apostles are 
sent by the Great Head of the 
Church, for whose coming I am 
seeking." (From "Picturesque 
America," p. 502.) Joseph Smith, 
a youth, while reading in the book 
of James, was impressed w ith these 
words: "If any of you lack wis- 
dom, let him ask of God, that giv- 
eth to all men liberally, and up- 
braideth not ; and it shall be given 
him. But let him ask in faith. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.. 



nothing wavering. For he that wav- 
ereth is like a wave of the sea 
driven with the wind and tossed." 
He went out in the woods, and 
prayed to God for light and wis- 
dom, and he declares that an evil 
power seized him while he was 
praying. When it seemed that he 
was about to be overcome, God, our 
heavenly Father, and our Lord and 
Master, Jesus Christ, appeared be- 
fore him. He remembered the ob- 
ject of his prayer was to inquire 
which of all the various Christian 
denominations of the day was in 
very deed the Church of Christ, and 
which he should join. The Father 
pointing to the Son, said: "This is 
my beloved Son ; hear Him." Jo- 
seph Smith quotes the words of the 
Savior as follows, referring to the 
various Christian denominations : 
"They draw near me with their lips 
but their hearts are far from me. 
They teach for doctrine the com- 
mandments of men, having a form 
of godliness, but denying the power 
thereof." 

Xow, the Latter-day Saints do 
not have a form of godliness deny- 
ing the power thereof, but they have 
in very deed the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, with all the power, with all 
the gifts, graces, and authority that 
were manifest in the day when the 
gospel was upon the earth, when 
fesus Christ committed it to His 
apostles. I rejoice in having the 
truth ; I rejoice in having a gospel 
that inspires all those who go forth 
to proclaim it, with a love for their 
follows, and with a determination 
to carry the message of life and sal- 
vation to the honest in heart, noc- 
withstanding all the opposition that 
may be brought against them. 
Ninety years have passed since Jo- 
seph Smith, a youth, announced that 
the Savior had told him all of the 



religions of the day were in error, 
that they had gone astray, that they 
were teaching the doctrines of men, 
that their churches were man-made 
institutions. Recently a divine, 
speaking up in Montana, bears evi- 
dence of the truth of what this youtn 
said, almost a century ago. I read 
from the report of his address : 

For a long time the following ques- 
tions have been uppermost in my 
rhyid: 

Is the church anything but a mere 
social organization? Is the Christi- 
anity of today the true doctrine of the 
Christ of the Bible? Has the so- 
called Christianity of today anything 
in it that ought to attract more than 
any other creed that is supposed to 
help humanity? Is not the church of 
today being boycotted and that just- 
ly? Are we not today concocting 
questionable schemes to operate our 
churches? Are the leaders in our 
churches truly pious and sincere? Is 
not the real object of the minister 
personal aggrandizement? — [The Lord 
and Master, ninety years ago, said 
they were divining for hire.] 

I know that such interrogations will 
not be very savory to many people, 
but knowing something concerning 
the church from too to bottom, and 
as I fear God, and would rather be 
true than be esteemed, I fearlessly 
propound them. 

The Christian community of the 
present is loud in its claims of vast 
conquest and remarkable victories. We 
are invited to see its acquired wealth, 
its tremendous expansion and to hear 
the clang of its enormous and in- 
tricate machine'rv. But with all of 
this I maintain that the Christianity 
of the present is face to face with a 
lamentable loss. The Christianity of 
today has acquired much, but in its 
getting it has lost its own soul, it has 
lost the Holy Ghost. No true man 
will dare refute this argument, for go 
where you may in Christendom today 
you will find that our religion is void 
of the supernatural element which the 
Bible claims it must have in order to 
exist. 

There are periods in the Christian 
era we look back unon with wonder 
and admiration. In those days men 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



were convicted of sin and a judgment 
to come. Then the more than human 
element was visible in our creed. 
Holy men had heavenly visions. Sick- 
ness was cured by spiritual power. 
The dead were raised. Holy men spoke 
with other tongues as the Spirit gave 
them utterance. Prison doors were 
opened and Ananias and Sapphira fell 
lifeless at the apostles' feet for play- 
ing with this power. Is the spiritual 
element that so characterized those 
days an ancient relic of something 
worn out like a garment? The com- 
mission to the early Christian teach- 
ers was that they must be imbued 
with power from on high and then 
go and baptize all nations in the 
name of the Holy Ghost, and that 
power was alwavs manifested when 
they performed the deed. 

The Christian religion of the pres- 
ent is merely a social code and has 
nothing in it whereby it could claim 
a divine origin. It is truly pitiable to 
behold the church religion of today 
trying to save this sinful world. 

We have lost our magnet. The Christ 
who said He would draw all men to 
Him if He were lifted up is disobeyed 
and ignored in the multiplicitv of our 
present church life. Since we have 
presented many substitutes to the 
world for genuine spiritual power, but 
they are of no more value in the sav- 
ing of the sinner than an artificial 
heart would be in pumping blood 
through the arteries. We are like men 
trying to run an engine without steam. 

The church of today is the church 
of man, not the church of God. I pre- 
dict its crashing to pieces like a ship 
on the rocks before a heavy sea, in 
the near-by years, unless there is a 
mighty turning to God in our ranks. 

We have a great educated, school- 
made ministry, but an unconverted 
ministry. We have a great host on 
our church rolls, but they are, with 
but few exceptions, an unconverted 
host. 

It is time for churchdom to do some 
housecleaning and remodeling. Now, 
while I have fearlessly declared that 
our present Christianity is but a shad- 
ow of its real self, still I must truth- 
fully say that when the church is com- 
pared with other social organizations, 
it is far in advance of the greater 
number of them in a moral sense. I 
am willing to grant the church first 



place on the social and moral calen- 
dar, but I do not believe that the 
church of today is the true church of 
Christ, because it is shorn of the 
Holy Ghost. 

It is time we read the second and ' 
third chapters of Revelation and ap- 
ply it to ourselves. We stand to 
preach the marvelous gospel of the 
great Christ, but are conspicuous for 
our weakness. God help us to find 
the upper room and acquire the tongue 
of fire. 

How I do thank God that the 
tongue of fire is acquired by the 
humble elders who go forth to pro- 
claim this gospel and that they are 
able, even as were the fishermen 
called by the Savior to follow Him 
and proclaim the gospel, to warm 
the hearts of the people and convict 
them of sin and cause them to re- 
pent. The Holy Ghost, the power 
of God, is with all those that £0 
forth to deliver this message, in 
every land and in every clime. The 
authority of God has been restored 
to the earth. We have it. God is 
with us. The Holy Ghost is with 
us. God bless all who labor for the 
spread of truth at home or abroad. 
We have the Spirit which they ac- 
knowledge that they lack. Roger 
Williams says there was no author- 
ized church on earth. This Mon- 
tana minister confirms his state- 
ment, and says that the Christianity 
of today is the Christianity of men ; 
he thus bears witness that the youth 
Joseph Smith, told the truth when 
he quoted the words of the Savior 
that none of the churches had the 
true gospel. I call to mind attend- 
ing a conference at Bradford, Eng- 
land, of two hundred and fifty odd 
elders, many of them young men. 
without experience, some of whom 
had never stood upon their feet in 
their lives to proclaim the gospel, 
until they reached the Liverpool of- 
fice ; and the Spirit of God was so 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

richly poured out upon the men who 
spoke there, that tears of gratitude 
ran down the cheeks of nearly every 
one present. I recall being present, 
recently, at a fast meeting in mem- 
orial cottage at the monument erect- 
ed to the memory of Joseph Smith, 
the Prophet, when many tears of 
gratitude were shed as the elders, 
about forty of them, testified of the 
goodness of God and the knowledge 
which they possessed that this gos- 
pel that you and I have embraced 
is in very deed the gospel of Christ. 

The Montana minister says : 
"There are periods in the Christian 
era we look back upon with won- 
der and admiration. In those days 
men were convicted of sin and a 
judgment to come.'' In these days 
men are convicted of sin and of a 
judgment to come, and they repent 
of those sins, and they reform their 
lives, as Brother Smith said here 
today. This gospel of Jesus Christ 
has lifted up many a man who was 
in the slough of despair, who was 
in sin and iniquity, and has made 
of him a godlike, godfearing, up- 
right man, ready and willing to go 
forth and proclaim that God lives, 
that Jesus is the Christ, that Jos- 
seph Smith is a prophet of God, and 
that he knows it. I testify that spir- 
itual manifestations are present in 
the gospel of Christ which we have 
embraced. Reverend Martin says 
that, in early times, "this more than 
human element was visible in our 
creed." The more than human ele- 
ment is visible in our creed today. 
"Holy men had heavenly visions." 
Men and women by the hundreds, 
yes by the thousands, have had vis- 
ions regarding the divinity of this 
work, and every honest soul who 
has embraced it has had the 
testimony of the Holy Spirit. 
The Holy Ghost, which Rev- 



erend Mr. Martin acknowledges 
that they do not have, is possessed 
by all the Latter-day Saints who are 
serving God. "Sickness was cured 
by spiritual power." I bear my wit- 
ness to you that if a record had been 
made of all those who have been af- 
flicted, those who have been given 
up to die, and who have been healed 
by the power of God, since the es- 
tablishment of the Church of Christ 
in our day, it would make a book 
much larger than the New Testa- 
ment. More miracles have been 
performed in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints than we 
have any account of in the days of 
the Savior and His apostles. Today, 
sickness is cured by spiritual pow- 
er. In all humility, and with grat- 
itude to God, my heavenly Father 
I acknowledge freely and frankly 
that God saw fit to heal me, and I 
am a living monument of the heal- 
ing power of Almighty God, which 
is in this Church of Christ. 

"The dead were raised." The dead 
have been raised. My own brother 
was announced to be dead, but by 
the prayer of faith he lives and pre- 
sides over one of the stakes of Zion. 
I know, as I know I live, that the 
healing power of Almighty God, 
that this man acknowledges is not in 
any of the churches, is in the Church 
of Christ of which you and I are 
members. 

"Holy men spake with other 
tongues as the spirit gave them ut- 
terance." I testify that the gift of 
tongues is in this Church, that it 
has been enjoyed by men and wom- 
en on very many occasions. I bear 
witness that there have been proph- 
ecies by the voice of tongues. I 
stand here in humility today and 
acknowledge that my wife, whose 
body now lies in the tomb, pro- 
nounced a blessing upon my head 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



by the spirit of tongues, all of which 
has been fulfilled. I testify, also, 
that the gift of tongues was mani- 
fested on one occasion, when I was 
a little child, playing on the floor in 
the home of the late William C. 
Staines, when Sister Whitney, Sis- 
ter Eliza R. Snow, Sister Zina D. 
Young, my mother and others of 
those noble women were present, 
whose lives are a testimony to all the 
world, of the purity, and the up- 
rightness, and the virtue that there 
is in the Church of Christ. They 
were holding a Relief Society meet- 
ing. There was some singing in 
tongues by Sister Whitney; there 
was given, by Sister Snow, through 
the gift of tongues, a blessing for 
all who were there. After the in- 
terpretation by Sister Young, and 
after Sister Snow had blest all the 
sisters, she turned and blest the boy 
playing on the floor, and Sister 
Young gave the interpretation. I 
did not understand it, but my moth- 
er made a record of it, and twenty 
vears after it was given it was ful- 
filled. What was it? It was that 
the boy should grow to manhood, 
tli at he should become one of the 
leaders of the Church, and that 
God would bless him in proclaiming 
this gospel in foreign lands. I say 
that the gift of tongues is in the 
Church of Christ. I say that I am a 
living witness that a prediction 
made on my head by the gift of 
tongues was fulfilled twenty years 
after the prediction was made. 

God lives ; Jesus is the Christ ; 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the 
true and the living God; Mormon- 
ism, so-called, is in very deed the 
gospel of Christ. May the Lord help 
you and me to be faithful, to be true, 
to be upright, to be honest, to be 
virtuous, to keep His command- 



ments is my prayer, and I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

A loving brother's raithful testimony. — 
Faith and prayers of the Saints ef- 
fective. 

It is with peculiar feelings that I 
stand before you on this occasion. 
I have been very much pleased with 
all that has been said thus far in 
this conference. I had thought that, 
probably, I might be called to ad- 
dress you for a few moments, and 
I have tried to think of something 
to say, but that something did not 
come. I can bear testimony, how- 
ever, that I know this is the work 
of God. I know that we are His 
people, that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of the living God, and that 
his successors in the presidency of 
the Church have been strictlv in 
the line and discharge of their du- 
ty. They have all been servants of 
the living God. Their testimony 
has been borne to the people, and 
! bear testimony that what they 
have said and done is right and 
proper, and has been inspired by the 
true spirit of our Heavenly Father. 

I was interested in listening to 
the remarks of my brother, in the 
opening session of the conference. 
If the people had known him as I 
have known him, from early vouth, 
even from his birth, they would not 
say that he said one thing and 
meant another. I think there is 
no man living who knows him bet- 
ter than I do. While he was a 
child, I carried him on my back. I 
watched over him as a babe, and as 
he grew up to manhood I have 
known every feature of his life. I 
know of his sinceritv and the truth 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



121 



of what he has said. There are 
many things which I might say, if 
I could think of them here, and I 
trust that through your faith and 
prayers, my memory may have 
some strength, that I may say 
something. 

I have been pleased with the 
testimonies that have been borne 
here. As Elder Grant has just now 
borne his testimony, and related 
some incidents in his life, so I may 
say that I also have a testimony in 
this regard. Many times I have 
been on crutches through accident. 
Twice I have been broken down 
physically, through over-exertion 
and exposure. For two or three 
years, I was down, as you might 
say, with rheumatism. At the ded- 
ication of the temple, the boys had 
to lift me in a buggy and take me 
there, and lift me out. Through 
the faith and prayers of the saints, 
and my friends, with, also, the help 
I could give myself, for I have al- 
ways tried to live in that way and 
manner that seemed prudent, I 
am now on my feet again. 

I know that there is a God in 
Israel. I know that He will hear 
and answer the prayers of the hon- 
est. I know that He has heard 
prayers in my behalf, and through 
these blessings I am here with you 
today. I trust that I may continue 
faithful and firm in the discharge 
of my duty. I ask the prayers and 
faith" of the saints that I may so 
continue ; that I may live long to 
fulfill the mission which Father has 
called me to perform, that I mav be 
a blessing to the people. May God 
add His blessings and guide us all 
bv His Spirit ; may He fit and pre- 
pare us for the events of His provi- 
dence, that when we have finished 
our course here, we may be worthy 
f the blessings which He has 



promised us ; this is my prayer, and 
I ask it, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Knowledge of God possessed by the 
Saints. — Individual effort to conform 
to God's laws. — God's Church and 
servants guided by inspiration. — 
Some persecute the Church ignor- 
antly. — Remarkable development of 
the Church in future. — Blessings in- 
voked upon the choir, the congre- 
gation, the Saints, this Government, 
and all nations. 

I very greatly desire the assist- 
ance of the Spirit of the Lord, which 
has been so generously enjoyed by 
the brethren who have occupied the 
time. In my heart there has been 
the same feeling, the same faith and 
inspiration that the brethren have 
enjoyed ; and while I speak to you I 
trust that you may discern that we 
are united, that we see alike, that 
we have the same spirit, the same 
faith, and are indeed the servants of 
the Lord. I have not only discov- 
ered this fact in connection with my 
brethren who are the chief elders of 
the Church, but I have discovered 
the same in the chief elders of the 
stakes of Zion, the presiding breth- 
ren, and they discover it in all the 
quorums and associations of the 
priesthood and of the people, as I 
have felt it in the councils of my 
brethren. 

I am sure that this great multi- 
tude of people, including the over- 
flow meetings, numbering possibly 
fifteen thousand souls, today, is an 
evidence that the Lord is pleased 
with His people as a whole. There 
may be individual instances and 
cases, as has always been, and no 
doubt will be to the end, of those 
who do not have the favor and ap- 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



proval of the Lord in their conduct ; 
but, quite generally, the overwhelm- 
ing majority of the Latter-day 
Saints enjoy a rich measure of His 
Spirit. You will remember that the 
Lord made the statement during 
His ministry, as you will find in the 
seventh chapter of St. John, that 
the work is the Father's, and that 
if any man will do His will, he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it is 
of God, or whether it is of man. I 
desire to make this impression up- 
on the hearts of those who are be- 
fore me today, that the secret of the 
success, and the measure of union 
enjoyed by the Latter-day Saints, is 
in consequence of their doing the 
will of the Father, and that all who 
have so done not alone know of the 
truth of the doctrines but they know 
the Father, they know the Son : and 
the Holy Ghost has borne record to 
the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, 
and has established a testimony 
within their souls in regard to our 
heavenly Father, in regard to His 
Son, and in regard to the Holy 
Ghost. Every individual member of 
the Church has that testimony, so 
far as he or she has done His will 
and kept His commandments. If 
there is anything lacking of strength 
and faith in their hearts, they may 
be weak in that testimony ; but the 
secret of the strength of this 
Church, with its less than a half 
million members, possibly, in the 
world, is due entirely to the faith of 
the people, the faith with which God 
has endowed them. The measure 
of that faith is just in propor- 
tion to their devotion and faithful- 
ness ; and it grows stronger with the 
people. 

There is permanent improvement 
and advancement among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, when you make al- 
lowance for our waywardness, our 



transgressions, and sins, and the 
like. The Latter-day Saints are a 
magnificent people, gathered togeth- 
er from the nations of the earth, 
choice men and women of an inde- 
pendence of character, and of stam- 
ina and faith, who are willing to la- 
bor for the building up of the king- 
dom, willing to make all the sacri- 
fices that are necessary, which they 
have done up to the present, and 
will do to the end. So far as we 
have failed and are faulty, we be- 
lieve in the principle of repentance 
and reformation, individual repen- 
tance and individual reformation 
which is attending upon our lives. 
I confess that every member of the 
Church has a struggle in this fallen 
world. We have trials ; we live but 
just a little season, not very long, in 
this life, less than a hundred vears, 
and we find that it occupies our at- 
tention and our best efforts in or- 
der to subdue our weaknesses and 
inclination to go astray ; but the 
Lord is merciful and patient with 
us. He has endowed us with a 
witness and the spirit that bears rec- 
ord of the Father and the Son. as 
the Holy Ghost bears record of the 
Father and the Son. We recognize 
the truth of that testimony ; so do 
we know the spirit ; we comprehend 
it, we feel it, and when we come to- 
gether on occasions of this kind, in 
a multitude, as we are gathered to- 
day, there is a vibration in the heart 
of every member of this Church 
and a testimony in regard to the 
truth. We do know — we know in- 
dividually ; the father does not have 
to know for the son. nor the son 
for the father, nor the mother for 
the daughter, but each individual 
soul is entitled to know the Father, 
and to have that witness, for the 
Father is revealed by the Holy 
Ghost. That spirit which bears roc- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



123 



ord of the Father and the Son, also 
bears record to us of His own di- 
vinity, bears record to us of the di- 
vine mission of the Prophet Joseph, 
as we have heard the testimonies 
here, so strong, and so beautifully 
given in this conference. 

I have been overwhelmed with 
the inspiration of the Lord and the 
testimony of my brethren, and so 
have you. I know that this con- 
gregation, and all the people who 
have been here and have listened, 
have felt the overwhelming influ- 
ence of the Spirit of God in their 
souls, and they have a testimony. 
If I were to ask the question here, 
how many there are who know that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that we enjoy the Holy Ghost, 
the inspiration and revelations 
thereof to our souls, this congre- 
gation would raise their hands, as 
they have done today to sustain the 
authorities of the Church, unani- 
mously, and there would be no op- 
posing vote so far as Latter-day 
Saints are concerned. We have not 
reached perfection, but we hope to 
reach it. We are laboring for that 
end, to do the will of God and to 
be perfect as He is perfect. That is 
the design and object of our living 
and being, and to perform our du- 
ties faithfully and well. We are 
under the guidance- of the Lord. He 
has gathered the people and has es- 
tablished them. He has established 
this Church, and it will remain and 
abide here, its home is here. The 
Lord has brought us here, and has 
sustained us here. He has brought 
you as well as He has brought me ; 
every individual member of this 
Church has been brought here by 
the Lord. His inspiration and Spir- 
it have rested upon the people, and 
they have been gathered together. 

God's servants have been inspired ; 



they have been guided by the in- 
spiration of the Lord, and this 
Church has been directed by Him. 
He always has at our head, and 
will always have at our head, from 
this time henceforth, a man through 
whom He can speak. That man is 
faithful and true, he is reliable and 
trustworthy, and he is known. The 
people know him, the people under- 
stand and know the voice of the 
true shepherd. They are not mis- 
taken; they are never mistaken, if 
they listen to the voice of the true 
shepherd; and we have the true 
shepherd. We have the man who 
represents God, whose words are 
as the words of the Lord, spoken 
for our guidance, for the guidance 
of the kingdom, for the establish- 
ment of the work of the Lord, for 
sending the gospel to the world, to 
open up His work throughout the 
earth. The Lord always has His 
servant, and He speaks through 
him ; and we listen. When we lis- 
ten, we are edified, we are instruct- 
ed, we are then correct in the posi- 
tion that we take and the work that 
we perform either at home or 
abroad. I thank the Lord for this. 
This work does not belong to a few 
brethren ; it does not belong to a few 
of the brethren who have presided 
over us. It never did belong to the 
Prophet Joseph and his brethren, 
nor those who have succeeded him. 
They have been the servants of the 
Lord ; but the work is the Lord's ; 
the kingdom is the Lord's ; and the 
kingdom will be taken care of by 
the Lord, and He will preserve it, 
and He will not allow us to go very 
far astray, for we are surrounded 
by those who know and can under- 
stand the truth and comprehend the 
spirit. If we are inclined to go 
astray, we will soon be brought 
back. If we make mistakes, we will 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be corrected. If we go wrong, if 
we transgress, we will be reproved, 
of course ; and the Lord will regu- 
late the kingdom, and He will use 
His servants in the various fields. 

At home our stakes are increas- 
ing — sixty-one stakes, all repre- 
sented, I believe, with possibly one 
exception, all represented in this 
great conference — sixty stakes of 
Zion, and representatives of very 
many of the missions of the United 
States. It is astonishing to note the 
inspiration and spirit that we find 
among this people. The people of 
the world are discovering the fact 
that they do not possess the Holy 
Ghost ; they are discovering the fact 
that they have not revelation and 
inspiration from the Lord. There 
are many men — thinking men, men 
of ability, men of judgment and 
experience, and scientific men — they 
are discovering that they are with- 
out God in the world ; that is, that 
He is not with them, that they have 
not a testimony. I have this to say 
.»f the ministers of the gospel 
throughout the earth, I accord to 
every minister, so far as I am ac- 
quainted with them, or know any- 
thing about them, the belief that 
they may be honest in their efforts 
and in the doctrines that they put 
forth, possibly with the very best 
light they have. But, they arc 
blinded, conscientiously and honest- 
ly blinded, no doubt, as we have 
had experiences of that kind in the 
days of the Savior, as well as with 
nen associated with this work in 
modern times. You remember it 
was referred to yesterday, by one 
of the brethren, that Saul of Tar- 
sus, afterwards Paul the apostle, 
was a conscientious man. an honest 
•nan. but in the darkness of his 
mind, in his waywardness and lack 
"f information, his lack of the spir- 



it and understanding of the gospel, 
he delighted in the persecution of 
the saints, and he indulged therein. 
He encouraged the persecution of 
the saints until his eyes were opened 
and until he saw the light. That 
will be the case with us. There will 
be Pauls raised up among us ; there 
v ill be men of just such experiences, 
and, no doubt, there have been al- 
ready men with experiences of that 
kind, who have not known the truth, 
and have felt they were doing God 
-crvice when they were trying to 
destroy the saints, working against 
us and working against the 
1'rophet Joseph. Many of those 
people who have persecuted us from 
the inception of this work have been 
conscientious and honest, and 
thought they were doing God's ser- 
vice. Of course, there may have 
I een others who knew better, men 
who were wilfully wicked : I do not 
care to say about that ; but many 
have; in their ignorance, fought 
against the truth. There have been 
men with strong prejudices; they 
believed that we were deluded, and 
they are against us quite unani- 
mously, because we have enter- 
tained the doctrine, the word of 
the Lord to the Prophet Joseph, that 
their creeds and doctrines were not 
pleasing but were really an abomi- 
nation in the sight of the Lord. 

Now. these were not the words 
of the Prophet ; but they were the 
words of the Son of God to the 
Prophet. He did not know- he 
could not tell anything, in his early 
life, in regard to these matters, but 
the Lord manifested to him that His 
church and kingdom were not upon 
the earth. The Lord gave the keys 
of authority and power to the 
Prophet Joseph; He revealed the 
truth, the plan of life and salva- 
tion and the Prophet Joseph laid 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

the foundations of this work, as 
Jesus told him to do ; for, as the 
Father said, "This is my beloved 
Son ; hear Him," and he listened to 
Him. He heard the Savior's voice, 
He saw Him and knew Him; and 
the Savior impressed Himself upon 
him, as did the Father, and he stood 
up in the midst of the world to de- 
clare the truth. He stood almost 
alone. Occasionally a man came to 
the rescue and helped him, assisted 
him in the translation of the Book 
of Mormon and the like ; but even 
after the establishment of the 
Church and its organization, it was 
difficult for him to find men to stand 
by him, to be truthful, to be true 
and faithful. It may be said he trod 
the winepress alone, as nearly alone 
as was the Son of God Himself, so 
far as that is concerned, for the 
Savior had about Him men that 
were trusted and more reliable than 
did the Prophet Joseph. True, there 
was a Judas with the apostles of the 
Lord Jesus ; but there were quite a 
number of brethren who fell bv the 
wayside, men upon whom you 
would have thought the Prophet 
could have leaned for support, Yet, 
he was faithful and true. The Lord 
was with him and sustained and 
preserved him until the foundations 
of this work were laid, and until 
men were prepared to take up the 
work and carry it along — Brigham 
Young, John Taylor, Wilford 
Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, as well 
as the Prophet who is with us to- 
day. These men were developed 
under the inspiration of the Lord, 
and they have been surrounded by 
men that were trustworthy, honor- 
able and reliable, men who have up- 
held their hands, and they have been 
successful. They will be success- 
full to the end. 

The Lord will take care of His 



kingdom and sustain His work. He 
will send this gospel to all the world, 
and the world will receive the doc- 
trines, eventually, and the Lord will 
inspire their hearts and prepare 
them to accept the truth. Great 
men will rise up and receive the 
truth that has been advocated and 
brought into the world through the 
inspiration of the Lord upon the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Men do not 
now acknowledge or recognize from 
whence it came, but finally it will be 
known, and the Lord will manifest 
to them the truth. Strong men, 
great and powerful men will be 
found among the nations of the 
earth, who will sustain this work 
and come to its rescue. It will be 
magnified and enlarged and estab- 
lished among the children of men. 
It will never grow less. It has quite 
an appearance today • among the 
Christian denominations of the 
earth, but it will be still more re- 
markable in the future. The Lord 
will magnify us, and strengthen us, 
and establish His kingdom upon the 
earth. That is my testimony, and I 
wanted to bear this testimony in 
connection with the testimonies that 
have been' borne today and in the 
other sessions of our conference. 
From the opening address by Pres- 
ident Smith, every man has borne 
testimony to the truth. These testi- 
monies are reliable and they are in 
force in the earth among the chil- 
dren of men. We have had the doc- 
trines of the gospel laid before us so 
splendidly and simply. 

Now, I feel to bless this congre- 
gation, and I think I had better 
bless this choir. President Smith. 
Oh, I love this choir, these brethren 
and these sisters here, Brother Evan 
Stevens and his assistants, and the 
organist, Brother McClellan, and 
his assistants. God bless you, my 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brethren and sisters, every soul, 
every girl and every boy, every wife 
and mother, father and brother ; 
God bless this choir. There is no 
such choir anywhere else in the 
world, and there is no such con- 
gregation anywhere else in the 
world. We are just a little people, 
not half a million; that is all there 
are of us; yet, there is nothing to 
compare with this on the face of 
the earth. You can't find such a 
sight anywhere as I see here today. 
Thank the Lord for'His blessings. 

The Lord bless these brethren, 
the members of the Twelve, the 
chosen twelve, faithful and true. 
They will endure and be faithful 
and true to the end. May the Lord 
bless the seventies, the high- 
priests and presiding brethren in 
the stakes and in the quorums and 
councils of the priesthood, at home 
and abroad ; and the sisters of all 
the associations and societies ; God 
bless them. God bless these breth- 
ren and sisters here and in this gal- 
lery, all around here, all Latter-day 
Saints, faithful and true. We have 
our weaknesses, but these are fairly 
faithful ; these are the choice breth- 
ren among us, choice people ; and yet. 
when you go into the stakes of Zion. 
President Smith, we find them by 
thousands — thousands, just as good 
as these. God bless the Latter-day 
Saints everywhere, and may He 
pour out His spirit upon them. God 
bless our friends and neighbors who 
live with us, who come in here and 
are helping us in the development 
of this great state and country. God 
bless them, and God bless the peo- 
ple of this nation that has pre- 
served us and given us protection 
and allowed us such glorious priv- 
ileges. 

It is wonderful that we have been 
allowed to establish the Church of 



Jesus Christ in the earth; it is won- 
derful ; and this nation will be blest 
of the Lord, and the people thereof 
will be blest, for their generosity 
and goodness. Men in high places, 
as the president, and others that 
are legislators for the nation and 
are executors for the nation, and the 
judges and all will be brought to 
favor Zion, and God will bless them 
and preserve them, and preserve 
this nation. He will preserve this 
nation, and other nations that have 
given us recruits for we have come 
from all the nations of the earth, 
nearly all, everywhere ; and we will 
yet come from Russia, and other 
parts of the world, and from South 
America and other parts that have 
not yet been proselyted. The Lord 
will move the obstacles, and He will 
send His" gospel ; He will preach the 
gospel Himself by His Spirit and 
power among the children of the 
earth. May we live and be worthy 
of the trust confided in us. 

Brethren, be humble and faithful, 
and do not forget the Lord, and do 
not forget your prayers, and re- 
member the prayers that are accept- 
able to the Lord. The prayers of 
faith will save us. The prayer of 
faith and the prayer that is the sin- 
cere intent of the heart will bring 
forth the blessings of the Lord. The 
reason we are not answered better 
than we are is because we are not 
as sincere, possibly, in our prayers, 
and our faith has not been mingled 
with our prayers as it should be. 
1 pray that faith and the spirit of 
the Lord may abide richly in the 
hearts of the people, that the bless- 
ings of the Lord may be upon all 
the brethren, upon the Presiding 
Patriarch, the Presiding Bishopric, 
and the brethren who officiate 
among the people, and may He pour 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



127 



out His blessings upon the heads of 
the saints everywhere. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, and keep you m the faith, 
and help us all to be true. God 
bless President Smith, that he may 
be healed from the crown of his 
head to the soles of his feet. May 
He bless Brother George Albert 
Smith, and any others of our breth- 
ren who need the blessings of the 
Lord. May His Spirit and the heal- 
ing power be upon them. May He 
bless the Presidency, President 
Lund and President John Henry ; 
God bless these bremren, that they 
may dwell in the fellowship and 
favor of the Lord; and grant that 
Ave may always know the truth, as 
we know light from darkness, and 
heat from cold, I humly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Testimony of Church members equal to 
that of their leaders. — There are not 
and can not be dupes or slaves in the 
Church. — Our doctrines are truth and 
righteousness, demonstrated by ; the 
Holy Scriptures. — Enemies of Mor- 
monism set up and fight "men of 
straw." — Earnest invocation of bless- 
ings. 

I shall not attempt to address you 
at much length. The most that 1 
could do, this afternoon, would be 
to emphasize and endorse, without 
recourse, every word and sentence 
and sentiment that has been spoken 
or expressed during the sessions of 
this conference, from the first to the 
last. I believe, with all my soul, in 
the testimonies that have been 
borne ; and what pleases me most of 
all is the fact that there are present 
here today hundreds of men and, 



perhaps, thousands of them, and 
women too, in this vast congrega- 
tion and others who have been in at- 
tendance at this conference, who can 
bear the same testimony that has 
been borne by the speakers who 
have addressed us during this con- 
ference. Some people in the world 
appear to have a great deal of sym- 
pathy for the poor, deluded, inno- 
cent, honest, deceived, down-trod- 
den and misled Latter-day Saints, 
as they seem to regard them, and 
at the same time they have fierce 
judgment to pronounce upon their 
"wicked and designing leaders." I 
wish to say to our friends, here, that 
there is no man nor set of men on 
earth today that can mislead this 
people very far out of the path of 
rectitude, righteousness and faith in 
the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. It can't be done. 
Why ? Because they know the prin- 
ciples of the gospel, as well as their 
leaders do. They have borne testi- 
mony of this truth to the world, al- 
most to a man. 

We send out to the nations of the 
earth two thousand elders every 
other year, practically, and they go 
abroad to the various nations full of 
faith and the spirit of this gospel, 
full of the testimony of Jesus Christ, 
which is the spirit of prophecy. They 
go out with the spirit of the gospel 
in their souls, to bear testimony to 
the world, and they do bear that 
testimony to the world, and they 
come home ripened in the knowl- 
edge of the truth, confirmed in their 
convictions, established in a knowl- 
edge of the principles of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and no power be- 
neath the Celestial kingdom can 
turn them from it, except they 
transgress the laws of righteousness 
themselves. Other men cannot turn 
them aside ; other men cannot con-

found them. They know the truth 
for themselves ; they have learned 
it in the school of experience, as 
well as by the gift and power of the 
Holy Ghost upon them. They know 
the truth, and the truth has made 
them free. There are no slaves, 
there are no dupes in this Church ; 
there are no men nor women worthy 
to claim an honorable standing' in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, who are not free 
men and free women in the highest 
sense of the word. What will be 
the result? The result will be that 
we will teach the principles of the 
gospel that we have received, that 
we have learned to be true, to our 
children, and we will endeavor to 
have them taught to our children's 
children to the latest generation, 
that our children may grow up in 
the nurture and admonition of the 
Lord, in the knowledge and in the 
love of the truth as it is in Christ 
Jesus. We will teach our children 
to be pure in heart, to be honest and 
upright, to be virtuous and God- 
fearing. We will teach them to ob- 
serve that greatest and most glor- 
ious moral law of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which if men obey it 
they cannot look upon adultery or 
upon any deadly sin with any de- 
gree of allowance. We will teach 
them that God rides, of right in the 
hearts of the children of men, in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and overrules in the na- 
tion of which we are a part, and in 
the nations of the earth. They are 
all subject to His power, and will 
bow beneath Llis rod when He shall 
determine to scourge the -wicked, to 
punish the ungodly, and to judge 
those that 'hear the truth and will 
not receive it. God will judge the 
nations of the earth and the people 
of the world, and He will mete out 



justice and judgment and right- 
eousness unto them ; we do not have 
to do that. 

I thought it had long- ago been 
determined that our enemies, those 
who are fighting against the gospel, 
against the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints,had abandoned the 
thought that they could successfully 
contend with us on scriptural 
ground. With but very few ex- 
ceptions, they have long- ago aban- 
doned that thought. The poor un- 
fortunate gentleman who made his 
binder, on this point as referred to 
by Brother Ivins, must have been 
raised somewhere in the back- 
woods, and had not yet awakened 
to the fact that his coworkers 
against the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints had long ago 
abandoned the hope that they could 
prevail against "Mormonism" on 
scriptural ground. They can't do it. 
I hey can and do contend against 
the Bible and the New Testament ; 
they can and many do deny Christ ; 
they can and many do deny His re- 
surrection from the dead and the 
glorious redemption that He has 
wrought for the world through obe- 
dience to His word and law ; they 
may do all that, but they cannot suc- 
cessfully meet us on scriptural 
ground. Why? Because we be- 
lieve in the scripture ; we are es- 
tablished upon the scriptures of di- 
vine truth ; we are built upon the 
foundations of apostles and proph- 
ets. Jesus Christ himself being the 
chief corner stone. They cannot 
uproot us nor overturn us by the 
scriptures ; it can't be done. 

Now, what means are they using 
and what means have they been 
using, for years, against the 
Church ? Ridicule, contumely, 
falsehood, slander, misrepresenta- 
tion ! Men that fight against the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints build up "men of straw" 
and slaughter them. They advance 
ideas that do not belong to us, that 
we have never held, that we do not 
advocate, that are no part of our 
doctrine or religion at all. They 
conjure up these propositions in 
their own minds, and then proceed, 
with all the eloquence and fervor 
of their souls, to tear in pieces and 
destroy the images of their own 
minds. They do not fight Mormon- 
ism — they can't, without they fight 
God and the truth ! The moment 
that men attempt to fight this 
Church they fight God, they fight 
the principles of His gospel and His 
truth ; they fight faith in God, faith 
in Jesus Christ, faith in righteous- 
ness, faith in the resurrection of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, faith in every 
principle that exalts and uplifts and 
ameliorates the condition of man in 
the world. If they undertake to 
fight us they fight these principles, 
because we have espoused these 
principles. They are our principles, 
and they are not principles of error, 
of injustice, or unvirtue, or of un- 
godliness. We do not espouse any 
such doctrine as that, neither do we 
teach it, when we are in the faith 
and fellowship of the Lord. 

I did not expect to talk so long. 
Why are you here today, my breth- 
ren and sisters? Why have you sat 
here and stood here, many of you, 
throughout the sessions of this con- 
ference? Because you know that 
the words that have been spoken 
to you, by your fellow servants and 
associates in the priesthood, have 
been words of truth and soberness, 
that is why you are here. That is 
why >' on came to this conference 
and remained here and kept the 
o-oocl. quiet order and paid the at- 
tention that you have. Who will 



turn you away from the path of 
righteousness, from the testimony 
that you possess, from the knowl- 
edge that you have of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which is, indeed, the 
power of God unto salvation? Who 
can do it? 

I endorse every word of bless- 
ing that has been pronounced by 
President Lyman, here, this after- 
noon. The Lord bless this people 
and all the people of the earth who 
desire righteousness and love truth. 
Especially, may the Lord bless these 
my brethren upon whom rests the 
responsibility of directing, guiding, 
and counseling the people over 
whom they are called to preside. 
May the spirit of presidency, of 
great wisdom, of fatherly kindness, 
of love unfeigned, and of charity 
brood over you, sink into your 
hearts, lead you to do good among 
the children of men, and to lift up 
your fellow servants and associates 
and the members of the Church 
among whom you labor, to the 
highest possible standard of virtue, 
honor, and righteousness. That is 
your mission, and you are qualified 
to do and fulfill the work required 
at your hands, if you will only seek 
the spirit of the gospel and abide in 
it and in the spirit of your calling. 

The Lord bless the fathers and 
the mothers in Israel, and their 
sons and daughters. May He keep 
our sons from error, from wicked 
ways and from temptations that 
beset them in the wicked world in 
which we live. May the Lord pre- 
serve the virtue, honor, and purity 
of our daughters, that they may be 
pure as the angels in the presence 
of God, and worthy to bear sons 
and daughters who shall abide in the 
truth, and who shall bear off, to the 
last, the kingdom of God, trium- 
phantly, throughout the world The

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord bless our fathers and mothers, 
our brothers and sisters. May He 
bless those who preside, those en- 
trusted with responsibility in the 
Church, that they may magnify 
their calling, honor their Lord and 
Master, honor the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, for, as 
it has been said, if this is indeed the 
Church of Jesus Christ, then to be 
a member in it is greater than to be 
an emperor or a king. For in mem- 
bership in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints we have 
assurance of deliverance from sin 
here, and we have the promise of 
eternal life now and evermore, and 
if we are faithful to our covenants, 
there is no power beneath the Ce- 
lestial kingdom that can take from 
us the crown of glory that awaits 
those who are faithful before the 
Lord. God bless you, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



The choir sang the hymn, "God 
be with you till we meet again." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Chas. F. Middleton. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 

Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at all the conference meet- 
mgs in the Tabernacle, and Prof- 
John J. McClellan played the ac- 
companiments, interludes, etc., on 
the great organ, assisted by Edward 
P. Kimball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker.

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Former Church leaders, now in spirit 
world, still deeply interested in our 
welfare. — Their presence and influ- 
ence, and that of other heavenly be- 
ings, felt here. — God an individual, 
not personally omnipresent — His 
power and knowledge embraces all 
creation — Obedience to the Gospel 
imparts a knowledge of God, which 
insures eternal life — The necessary 
Divine authority restored in this 
age — Special ministry of the Twelve 
Apostles — The Saints should be ex- 
ponents and exemplars of righteous- 
ness — Fourteen years summary of 
Church finances. 

I shall need the assistance of the 
Good Spirit and the good feeling 
and faith and sympathy of my 
brethren and sisters this morning in 
an endeavor to speak to you for a 
short time. I hope it will be a short 
time, too, for at present I do not feel 
nor design to occupy very much of 
the time. I could not express my 
gratitude with language in my pos- 
session, which I feel this morning 
in being permitted, under the mer- 
cies of the Father of us all, to be

present with you and behold the 
sight that I see in the assembled 
multitudes gathered here in the 
opening session of this con- 
ference, on the Eighty-sixth an- 
niversary of the organization of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I feel sure that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and his 
associates, who, under the guidance 
and inspiration of the Almighty, 
and by His power, began this lat- 
ter-day work, would rejoice and do 
rejoice. — I was g'oing to say if they 
were permitted to look down upon 
the scene that I behold in this taber- 
nacle, but I believe they do have the 
privilege of looking down upon us 
just as the all-seeing eye of God be- 
holds every part of His handiwork. 
For I believe that those who have 
been chosen in this dispensation and 
in former dispensations, to lay the 
foundation of God's work in the 
midst of the children of men, for 
their salvation and exaltation, will 
not be deprived in the spirit world 
from looking down upon the re- 
sults of their own labors, efforts 
and mission assigned them by the 
wisdom and purpose of God, to help 
to redeem and to reclaim the chil- 
dren of the Father from their sins. 
So I feel quite confident, that the 
eye of Joseph, the Prophet, and of 
the martyrs of this dispensation, 
and of Brigham and John and Wil- 
ford, and those faithful men who 
were associated with them in their 
ministry upon the earth, are care- 
fully guarding the interests of the 
Kingdom of God in which they la- 
bored and for which they strove 
during their mortal lives. I believe 
they are as deeply interested in our 
welfare today, if not with greater ca- 
pacity, with far more interest behind 
the veil, than they were in the flesh. 
I believe they know more ; I believe 



their minds have expanded beyond 
their comprehension in mortal life, 
and their interests are enlarged and 
expanded in the work of the Lord 
to which they gave their lives and 
their best service. Although some 
may feel and think that it is a little 
extreme to take this view, yet I be- 
lieve that it is true ; and 1 have a 
feeling in my heart that I stand in 
the presence not only of the Father 
and of the Son, but in the presence 
of those whom God commissioned, 
raised up and inspired to lay the 
foundations of the work in which 
we are engaged. Accompanying 
that sense or feeling, I am im- 
pressed with the thought that I 
would not this moment say or do 
one thing that would be taken as 
unwise or imprudent, or that would 
give offense to any of my former 
associates and co-laborers in the 
work of the Lord. 

I would not like to say one thing, 
or express a thought that would 
grieve the heart of Joseph, or of 
Brigham, or of John, or of Wilford, 
or Lorenzo, or any of their faithful 
associates in the ministry. Some- 
times the Lord expands our vision 
from this point of view and this 
side of the veil, that we feel and 
seem to realize that we can look 
beyond the thin veil which separ- 
ates us from that other sphere. If 
we can see by the enlightening in- 
fluence of the Spirit of God and 
through the words that have been 
spoken by the holy prophets of God, 
beyond the veil that separates us 
from the spirit world, surely those 
who have passed beyond, can see 
more clearly through the veil back 
here to us than it is possible for us 
to see to them from our sphere of 
action. I believe we move and have 
our being in the presence of heav- 
enly messengers and of heavenly

beings. We are not separate from 
them. We begin to realize more 
and more fully, as we become ac- 
quainted with the principles of the 
Gospel, as they have been revealed 
anew in this dispensation, that we 
are closely related to our kindred, 
to our ancestors, to our friends 
and associates and co-laborers who 
have preceded us into the spirit 
world. We can not forget them ; 
we do not cease to love them ; we 
always hold them in our hearts, in 
memory, and thus we are associated 
and united to them by ties that we 
can not break, that we can not dis- 
solve or free ourselves from. If 
this is the case with us in our finite 
condition, surrounded by our mor- 
tal weaknesses, short-sightedness, 
lack of inspiration and wisdom 
from time to time, how much more 
certain it is and reasonable and con- 
sistent to believe that those who 
have been faithful, who have gone 
beyond and are still engaged in the 
work for the salvation of the souls 
of men, the opening of the prison 
doors to them that are bound and 
proclaiming liberty to the captives 
who can see us better than we can 
see them ; that they know us better 
than we know them. They have 
advanced ; we are advancing ; we 
are growing as they have grown ; 
we are reaching the goal that they 
have attained unto ; and therefore, 
I claim that we live in their pres- 
ence, they see us, they are solicit- 
ous for our welfare, they love us 
now more than ever. For now they 
see the dangers that beset us ; they 
can comprehend better than ever 
before, the weaknesses that are lia- 
ble to mislead us into dark and for- 
bidden paths. They see the tempta- 
tions and the evils that beset us in 
life and the proneness of mortal be- 
ings to yield to temptation and to 



wrong doing ; hence their solicitude 
for us and their love for us and 
their desire for our well being must 
be greater than that which we feel 
for ourselves. I thank God for the 
feeling that I possess and enjoy and 
for the realization that I have, that 
I stand, not only in the presence of 
Almighty God, my Maker and 
Father, but in the presence of His 
Only Begotten Son in the flesh, the 
Savior of the world ; and I stand in 
the presence of Peter and James, 
(and perhaps the eyes of John are 
also upon us and we know it not) ; 
and that I stand also in the presence 
of Joseph and Hyrum and Brigham 
and John, and those who have been 
valiant in the testimony of Jesus 
Christ and faithful to their mission 
in the world, who have gone before. 
When I go I want to have the priv- 
ilege of meeting them with the con- 
sciousness that I have followed 
their example, that I have carried 
out the mission in which they were 
engaged as they would have it car- 
ried out ; that I have been as faith- 
ful in the discharge of duty com- 
mitted to me and required at my 
hand as they were faithful in their 
time, and that when I meet them I 
shall meet them as I met them here, 
in love, in harmony, in unison and 
in perfect confidence that I have 
done my duty as they have done 
theirs. 

I hope you will forgive me for 
my emotion. You would have 
peculiar emotions, would you not, if 
you felt that you .stood in the pres- 
ence of your Father, in the very 
presence of Almighty God, in the 
very presence of the Son of God 
and of holy angels? You would 
feel rather emotional, rather sensi- 
tive. I feel it to the very depths of 
my soul this moment. So I hope 
you will forgive me, if I exhibit

some of my real feelings. I am only 
a child, I am only learning, and I 
hope I shall not be ever learning 
and never come to the knowledge 
of the truth. I sincerely hope that 
as I learn little by little, line upon 
line and precept upon precept, here 
a little and there a little, clay by 
day, and month by month, and year 
by year, that there will come a time 
when I shall have learned indeed 
the truth and shall know it as God 
knows it and be saved and exalted 
in His presence. Now, my mission, 
my duty, from the days of my child- 
hood, has been to proclaim the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ as the power of 
God unto salvation, unto all who 
will receive and obey it. It is my 
duty to proclaim to my brethren, to 
the household of faith, as well as to 
the world, when opportunity pre- 
sents, that I believe in the living 
God, the Father of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, who begot 
His Son, his only begotten in the 
flesh, and that Son grew from His 
birth unto His manhood and devel- 
oped into the very image and like- 
ness of His Father, insomuch that 
He declared on one occasion that 
"he that hath seen me, hath seen the 
Father." I do not believe in the 
doctrines held by some that God is 
only a spirit and that He is of such 
a nature that He fills the immensity 
of space, and is everywhere pres- 
ent in person or without person, 
for I can not conceive it possible 
that God could be a person if He 
filled the immensity of space and 
was everywhere present at the same 
time. It is a physical, a theological, 
an unreasonable, inconsistency to 
imagine that even God the Eternal 
Father would be in two places, as 
an individual, at the same moment. 
It is impossible. But His power ex- 
tends throughout the immensity of 



space, His power extends to all His 
creations, and His knowledge com- 
prehends them all, and He governs 
them all and He knows all. It is a 
scriptural truth, that this is life 
eternal to know the only true and 
living God and Jesus Christ whom 
thou hast sent. I believe that the 
Latter-day Saints, through the 
teachings of the scriptures and 
through the revelations that have 
come to them by the voice of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, are able to 
learn the true and living God and 
know Him and also His Son whom 
He has sent into the world, whom 
to know is life eternal. Not sim- 
ply the knowledge of it but having 
that knowledge we are inclined and 
determined to observe His pre- 
cepts, obey His laws, be submissive 
to His requirements in every par- 
ticular and accept every ordinance 
of the house of God and of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been 
devised by the will of the Father 
for the qualification of His children 
in the earth to return into His 
presence. And he that knoweth 
God and Jesus Christ, whom to 
know is life eternal, will verify that 
knowledge by ample and continuous 
and faithful obedience to every re- 
quirement that God makes of His 
children, and therein consists the 
salvation and the gift of eternal 
life. The devil knows the Father 
much better than we. Lucifer, the 
son of the morning, knows Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, much better 
than we, but in him it is not and 
will not redound to eternal life; for 
knowing, he yet rebels ; knowing he 
yet is disobedient ; he will not re- 
ceive the truth ; he will not abide in 
the truth ; hence he is Perdition, and 
there is no salvation for him. The 
same doctrine applies to me and to 
you and to all the sons and daugh-

ters of God who have judgment and 
knowledge and are able to reason 
between cause and effect, and deter- 
mine the right from the wrong and 
the good from the evil and who are 
capable of seeing the light and dis- 
tinguishing it from the darkness. 
Then this is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, to know the only true and 
living God and His Son whom He 
has sent into the world, which 
knowledge comes through obedi- 
ence to all His commandments, 
faith, repentence of sin, baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, 
the gift of the Holy Ghost by the 
laying on of hands by divine au- 
thority, and not by the will of man. 
This then is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ which is the power of God 
unto salvation; obedience to the 
truth, submission to the order that 
God has established in His house, 
for the house of God is a house of 
order and not a house of confusion. 
God has set in His Church apostles 
and prophets and evangelists and 
pastors and teachers whose duty is 
to administer to the people, to teach, 
instruct, expound, exhort, admonish 
and lead in the path of righteous- 
ness. The people who are associ- 
ated in this organization, must ■ 
harken to the voice of him who has 
divine authority to guide and direct 
and counsel in the midst of Israel. 
All these are necessary in the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ and many 
things, too many for me to mention 
here, are necessary, including 
the ordinances of the house of 
God, revealed in greater plainness 
in this dispensation than perhaps in 
any former dispensation since the 
world was formed. All these or- 
dinances are essential, in their place 
and in their time, and none of us are 
big enough or good enough or pos- 
sess sufficient independence in our- 



selves to ignore these things thatGod 
has revealed and required of us. No 
man is too big, too great or knows 
so much, that he is independent of 
God. We are here on His earth, 
we breathe His air, we behold His 
sunlight, we eat His food and we 
wear His clothing ; He has provided 
all the elements by which we are 
clothed and fed and live and move 
and have our being in the world. 
We are not independent of God, not 
for one moment. Not only do we 
believe in the Father and in the Son 
and in their words and counsel and 
divine authority which they brought 
and gave to men in the flesh, but 
we believe also in the divinity of 
the mission of Joseph the Prophet. 
We accept him as the one author- 
ized, empowered, clothed with wis- 
dom and knowledge in our day and 
time, to lay the foundations of the 
Church of Jesus Christ and to re- 
store the fullness of the Gospel of 
salvation to the world ;to revive and 
renew in the hearts of the children 
of men the doctrines of Christ, the 
ordinances of His Gospel which He 
taught, which He administered and 
which He authorized His disciples 
to administer to all that would, 
calling upon all men to repent 
and believe in the name of the 
Father and of the Son. We believe 
that God has restored the divine 
priesthood, which holds the keys of 
ministration of the ordinances of 
life, to the children of men. With- 
out that divine priesthood no man 
could receive or would receive a re- 
mission of sirrs by being buried in 
the water. It has to be by divine 
authority and without that divine 
authority our works would not be 
acceptable to the Lord, for He will 
not accept -at the hands of the chil- 
dren of men that which He has not 
authorized them to do, which He 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



has not qualified them to do, and 
called and appointed them to do ; 
but when God calls men and or- 
dains, and appoints, and gives them 
authority to administer in the name 
of the Father and of the Son and of 
the Holy Ghost, what they do can 
not fail to be sanctioned and ap- 
proved by the author and giver of 
the authority. When we receive 
the priesthood of God, and we do 
according to His word, then is He 
bound, and otherwise there is no 
promise. Now I can't tell you all 
that I would like to. Time will not 
permit, and there are others to 
speak and all these, your brethren, 
that are called to the apostleship 
and to minister in the midst of the 
house of Israel are endowed, or 
ought to be endowed, richly with 
the spirit of their calling. For in- 
stance these twelve disciples of 
Christ are supposed to be eye and 
ear witnesses of the divine mission 
of Jesus Christ. It is not permissi- 
ble for them to say, I believe, sim- 
ply; I have accepted it simply be- 
cause I believe it. Read the revela- 
tion, the Lord informs us they must 
know, they must get the knowledge 
for themselves, it must be with 
them as though they had seen with 
their eyes and heard with their ears 
and they know the truth. That is 
their mission, to testify of Jesus 
Christ and Him crucified and risen 
from the dead and clothed now 
with almighty power at the right 
hand of God, the Savior of the 
world. That is their mission, and 
their duty, and that is the doctrine 
and the truth that it is their duty to 
preach to the world and see that it 
is preached to the world. Where 
they can not go themselves they are 
to have the help of others called to 
their assistance, the Seventies first, 
also the elders and the high priests. 



Those who hold the Melchizedek 
priesthood who are not otherwise 
appointed are under their direc- 
tion to preach the Gospel to the 
world and to declare the truth — that 
Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph 
is a prophet of God and was author- 
ized and qualified to lay the founda- 
tion of the Kingdom of God. And 
when I say Kingdom of God I mean 
what I say. Christ is the King — not 
man. No man is king of the King- 
dom of God; God is the King of it 
and we acknowledge Him and Him 
only as Sovereign of His Kingdom. 
Now we all need patience, for- 
bearance, forgiveness, humility, 
charity, love unfeigned, devotion to 
the truth, abhorrence of sin and 
wickedness, rebellion and disobedi- 
ence to the requirements of the Gos- 
pel. These are the qualifications re- 
quisite to Latter-day Saints and to 
becoming Latter-day Saints and 
members in good standing in the 
Church of Jesus Christ and heirs of 
God and joint heirs with Jesus 
Christ. No member in good stand- 
ing in the Church will be drunken 
or riotous or profane or will take 
advantage of his brother or his 
neighbor or will violate the princi- 
ples of virtue and honor and right- 
eousness. No member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
in good standing will ever be 
chargeable with such offenses as 
these because they will avoid these 
evils and they will live above them. 
Then we have a mission in the 
world, each man, each woman, each 
child, who has grown to under- 
standing or to the years of account- 
ability, ought to be examples to the 
world, ought, not only to be quali- 
fied to preach the truth, to bear tes- 
timony of the truth, but they ought 
to live so that the very life they live, 
the very words they speak, their

nion to the unwary and to the ig- honor more than my brethren, but

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I scarcely need to add one remark 
to this report ; but I want to tell you 
this, that the tithes and means of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints have not stuck to my 
hands nor to the hands of any of 
my associates. They have gone to 
their legitimate purposes. 

Now we are building a temple in 
Canada. We are building another 
in Hawaii, and we are building an 
office building for the Church, a 
library, and a record depository 
that will be safe for the records of 
the Church, which for many years 
have been exposed to danger of de- 
struction by fire or by other means ; 
and we hope soon to have a place 
that will be practically fire-proof 
and that will be capacious enough 
to hold the records of the Church 
for many years to come. 

How has it been done? How can 
we continue to do such things as 
these? Simply by the Latter-day 
Saints observing the laws of God 
and the rules of His Church ; and 
while you do your duty I will guar- 
antee to you, so long as my brethren 
are in charge, with whom I am as- 
sociated, you will never have cause 
to suspect that your means will be 
misused or misappropriated. Gol 
bless you and all the household of 
faith, and help us to be true and 
faithful to the end, realizing that 
the battle is not to the strong, nor 
the race to the swift, but to him 
that endures to the end. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

The past fouiteen years of increased 
tithe paying marks great progress 
in Church affairs — Remarxable in- 
crease in Temple work, and addi- 
tions in Church membership — 



Faithful activity of workers in 
Church organizations — • Extensive 
work of Church educational insti- 
tutions — Detailed explanation of 
Religion Class work — The Universe 
governed by law, and God makes 
the law. 

I feel the need of your sympathy 
and prayers in presenting myself 
before this large congregation. I 
have rejoiced in the good words 
spoken by our president. The up- 
lifting and inspiring speech he has 
given us I know will be remembered 
by all present. I feel, as he told us, 
that we all stand in the presence of 
our Heavenly Father, who has 
means whereby He can know all 
about us, even of our inmost 
thoughts. Knowiig this ought to 
make us careful to walk in His 
ways and obey H- i commandments. 

I was also pleased to hear the fig- 
ures read by the President, telling 
us what has been done during the 
past fourteen years. I thought, 
many small amounts have amounted 
to great sums. Millions have been 
spent in the upbuilding of this 
work, and the books are open to 
show where every cent has gone 
that has been paid into the funds of 
the Church, and I believe you all 
approve the purposes for which the 
money has been expended. Mil- 
lions have been appropriated to the 
poor, to the erection of houses of 
worship where the Saints can go 
and be built up in their holy faith ; 
great amounts have been paid to- 
wards the temples, the missions, 
and so on. I feel thankful that the 
Saints have opened their hearts and 
contributed of their means for the 
purposes we have just heard stated. 
They have felt to obey the law of 
tithing which the Lord has given us, 
and they have had full confidence 
that the money would be spent in 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



the upbuilding of the Kingdom of 
God. 

It is a large number of persons 
who have joined the Church in the 
short time that President Smith has 
stood at the head of this adminis- 
tration, and a great number also 
that have passed through the tem- 
ples. It is encouraging to hear of 
the increase in our different associa- 
tions ; for they are all useful in the 
strengthening of the faith of their 
members. 

The last statistics read stated that 
the Religion Classes had increased 
eighty-five per cent. I am pleased 
to hear this, for I have thought that 
the Saints hardly know what the 
Religion Class stands for, and in a 
good many places they have consid- 
ered it was an extra burden upon 
the bishops and teachers. Now, I 
believe that when it is fully under- 
stood, the Saints will see the great 
necessity of sustaining and cherish- 
ing these classes. 

At the beginning of Brother 
Woodruff's administration, the 
First Presidency were impressed to 
start more Church schools. They 
felt that places should be prepared 
where our young people could re- 
ceive a systematic training in the 
principles of the Gospel. A Church 
Board of Education was organized 
whose members came together and 
discussed the problem of what 
would be the best plan for educating 
our children in the branch of the- 
ology, which could not be taught in 
the secular schools. The Church 
schools were started and were or- 
ganized on the plan of the Brig- 
ham Young Academy. The Prin- 
cipal of that school, the able and de- 
voted teacher, Brother Maeser, was 
appointed superintendent of the 
Church school system. You know 
how faithfully he worked to organ- 



ize the Church schools, and how 
thankful hundreds and thousands 
of our' young people are that they 
were favored by receiving an edu- 
cation in these institutions. These 
schools have continued to prosper, 
and their membership reaches as 
high a number as we are able to 
accommodate. They have done and 
are doing a world of good among 
our young people. We would like 
to have all our children educated in 
an institution where not only the 
hand and the brain could be trained, 
but where spiritual matters could 
also be attended to ; but it is not 
possible for us to reach so far with 
the means at our disposal, although 
millions have been spent, of the 
tithing, to sustain the Church 
schools. 

We have a splendid public school 
system in this State. Our grade 
schools, our high schools, our agri- 
cultural college and university stand 
high. I believe they compare fa- 
vorably with any in the land. Of 
course there are higher institutions 
of learning, in other states much 
more highly endowed than our uni- 
versity, and able to do more ; but 
for the means that are invested and 
have been spent here in the state, 
I think we see good results. Last 
year, our Governor told me, we 
spent on education in the state 
schools from eighty-six to eighty- 
eight per cent of the state taxes. 
This shows how great an interest is 
taken in education. I doubt that 
any other state in the Union can 
show so great a percentage of state 
means set apart for educational 
purposes as the Utah legislatures 
have done. But although the school 
system of Utah stands as high as 
any, there is a defect in schools that 
are conducted without religious in- 
struction. Educators east and west 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who have studied this matter have 
come to that conclusion. 

Recently a large convention was 
held in Chicago, in which educa- 
tors discussed the problem of teach- 
ing religion in our public schools. 
It is not so easy to do this here as 
it is in countries where they have 
a state religion, and consequently 
can teach that religion in their edu- 
cational institutions, but here, where 
the public schools are open to chil- 
dren of parents belonging to dif- 
ferent denominations, it is more dif- 
ficult. Some of the educators pres- 
ent at this convention suggested 
that a certain time for studying 
religion might be put into the cur- 
riculum of the schools, and the chil- 
dren go into rooms where teachers 
or ministers could teach them the 
religion of their fathers. 1 don't 
know what conclusion \vas arrived 
at, as I have not read the full pro- 
ceedings of the convention, but the 
suggestion referred to was some- 
thing like what they do in Canada. 
There they have a law that provides 
for religious education in the pub- 
lic schools, and those who teach it 
are paid by the state. Their states- 
men know that it is for the good of 
the children not only to have their 
intellects trained, but also the heart 
and the emotions, and to learn con- 
cerning God and His will with men. 
In Canada the public school is the 
same as here, free and open to all 
denominations, and the ministers of 
these have been given the right to 
gather the children around them in 
the school house and teach them the 
principles their parents believe in. 

We realize the defect in an edu- 
cation without religious and moral 
instruction, and we want to supply 
some means whereby this lack can 
be remedied. In some places we 
gather the children once a week in 



the Religion Classes to teach them 
practical religion. In other places 
these classes meet five times a week 
or once every school day. The ob- 
jection that has been raised that it 
lays too much burden upon the chil- 
dren to attend these classes, because 
they have so much to learn in the 
day school that they cannot attend 
to the studies which the Religion 
Classes would give them, is not of 
much weight, as the children are 
not asked to study these lessons 
outside of the Religion Classes. 
When they meet in the classes they 
are taught by concrete examples, 
and in a way that requires of them 
only their attention while in the 
classes ; and teachers of such chil- 
dren say that they are more easily 
managed and pay better attention 
than they did before they took the 
studies in the Religion Classes. 

As these classes were parts of the 
Church school system, Brother 
Maeser was placed in charge of 
them also, and during his last years 
he worked hard to make them a suc- 
cess. His whole soul was absorbed 
in studying the best way of reach- 
ing the children's hearts. Once 
when he was going to a place to or- 
ganize the Religion Class, he asked 
himself the question, "What shall 
be the procedure ?" He prayed 
about it, and the method we follow, 
called the six steps, came to his 
mind, and we have found this mode 
very successful. 

We would like you who have not 
attended a session of the Religion 
Classes to do so and see how our 
brethren and sisters are teaching 
the young that attend the classes. 
The classes are opened by singing, 
led by the teacher or by one of the 
children, as he or she may direct. 
The singing is not accompanied 
with instrumental music. We like 



PRESIDENT ANT H0\ r H. LUND. 



Jl 



them to be independent of such help 
and able to strike the right pitch 
themselves. When our young men 
are called to go out into the mis- 
sionary field, you know what .a 
blessing it is to them to be able to 
sing. When they stand on the 
street corner, with their backs to a 
lamp-post and a large congrega- 
tion before them, they have no in- 
strument to help them in starting 
the song, it is well for them if they 
arc able to do it correctly. How 
many of you brethren have not had 
experience of this kind ? 

After the children have sung a 
hymn, their hearts are attuned for 
the second step, which is prayer. 
Here one of the boys or girls will 
volunteer to offer the prayer when 
the teacher calls on them to do so, 
and the boy or girl chosen to lead 
will utter a short sentence or a short 
phrase, which all repeat in concert, 
and then the next sentence will be 
given and repeated, and so on until 
the prayer is ended. Repeating 
the words spoken by the one offer- 
ing the prayer secures attention, for 
all are alert to join in the prayers 
and to pronounce the words which 
the leader has spoken. 

The third step is to learn a mem- 
ory gem, or good thought. The 
teacher will lead out with a short 
part of the quotation and the chil- 
dren repeat it after her. When it 
is learned the next part of the quo- 
tation is given, and so to the end 
of it. By this method a great many 
precious thoughts are stored away 
in the minds of the children that 
will help them in time to come. 

Then comes the fourth step, 
which is the real lesson, and takes 
the longest time. The lesson and 
the memory gem are generally so 
related that one explains the other. 
The lessons generally consist in 



narratives and concrete examples, 
which the children love to hear, and 
which will make such an impres- 
sion upon their minds that they will 
remember them, and will try to 
carry out that which has been 
taught them. 

The fifth step is testimony-bear- 
ing. We ask the children to bear 
testimony of what they have them- 
selves experienced, what they know 
of the goodness of God, the good- 
ness of their parents, and of others, 
what joy has come to their hearts 
in performing a good act, an un- 
selfish act to others. All of this we 
consider good material for testi- 
mony bearing, and if you listen to 
these children bearing their testi- 
mony, it will often melt your heart, 
for you know they are innocent and 
honest in what they say, and we can 
see how the Spirit of the Lord is 
working upon their young hearts. 
They will tell of visiting a sick 
comrade and comforting them, per- 
haps bringing him flowers ; they 
will tell of taking part in cutting 
the wood of a widow for winter use, 
and of so many other things that 
they have done. The object of the 
Religion Class is to imbue their 
hearts with practical religion, that 
is, as James defines it, "to visit the 
fatherless and the widows in their 
affliction, and to keep themselves 
unspotted from the world." The 
sixth step is singing and prayer, 
conducted as were the opening ex- 
ercises. 

You ought not to neglect sending 
your children to the Religion 
Classes, for they need the instruc- 
tion given there. I have heard 
many examples mentioned in our 
Board where these young children 
have been able to bring their par- 
ents to renewed diligence in the 
performance of their duty, and even 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bringing families into the Church 
that had not before understood the 
Gospel. It gives us joy to hear 
these things, and I will plead with 
you, my brethren and sisters, to sus- 
tain the movement of our Religion 
Classes. The children will be 
built up and encouraged in well- 
doing, and the time they spend 
there does not interfere with their 
other studies. I hope the time will 
come when educators in the whole 
land will be able to devise some plan 
whereby such religious teaching as 
the parents desire the children to 
receive can be given them in the 
public schools. 

A short time ago I attended the 
dedication of the Brigham City 
Theological Seminary. It has been 
erected for the purpose of giving 
the students of our faith, who at- 
tend the high school there, an op- 
portunity to study the history of 
th« Bible and the principles of the 
Gospel. More than two hundred 
students are enrolled, and are en- 
thusiastic in taking this branch of 
study. Having a school building 
on an adjoining lot to that of the 
high school gives the students at- 
tending it nearly all the benefits of 
a Church school education. There 
are a few / other seminaries similarly 
located in the neighborhood of high 
schools, which are also doing excel- 
lent work. We do not want to in- 
duce the children of parents not be- 
longing to our faith to attend these 
classes, but we would like our own 
students to do so, for we do see a 
great need of having their hearts 
fortified against the many theories 
that will be presented before them, 
and which tend to taking away their 
faith. We want to have them fort- 
ified against the insinuating sugges- 
tions they may hear of learned men, 
that the world is a self-sustainine 



machine, and consequently there is 
no need of a God, that there is no 
spirit in man, and hence there will 
be no resurrection; that everything 
js ruled by law and therefore prayer 
is useless. Now, we want a founda- 
tion of faith in God laid so firmly 
in the hearts of our children that 
it cannot be shaken. But some ask 
are you afraid, then, of evolution 
and other theories that are taught 
so extensively? We are not afraid 
that the revealed Gospel shall be 
proved untrue by anything that men 
may discover ; for truth will always 
square with truth, but theories of 
men are not always true ; the sci- 
entists often take hypotheses as 
proven facts, and they assume that 
it has taken millions of years to 
produce the changes which they 
claim have gradually taken place in 
plants and animals, during the dif- 
ferent periods of the earth. 

We believe that everything is 
ruled by law. We are thankful that 
it is so, for otherwise we would 
live in a world of chance, in a fear- 
ful uncertainty of what would hap- 
pen next. I believe that the ma- 
terial laws that can be traced in the 
creation had an intelligent will be- 
hind them, that the laws themselves 
were never superior to the will of 
God. He made those laws, and by 
His power they became effective to 
accomplish His purposes. It is to 
Him that we pray, and we know he 
is almighty and does hear prayers, 
and though He uses material laws 
to carry out His plans, His will was 
never subjected to the laws, but the 
laws have ever been subservient to 
Him. Let no one think that God is 
impotent, that the laws He has 
made stand in the way of His hear- 
ing His children and answering 
their prayers. 

I see the time is going. I feel 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

thankful to be here with you breth- 
ren and sisters, to bear my testi- 
mony to the truth of the Gospel, 
which is that Jesus is the Savior 
and Redeemer of the world, and 
that He is the Only Begotten of the 
Father. May the Lord help us ever 
to be true and faithful in the cove- 
nants we have made with Him, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

President Smith read a notice, 
issued by the Presiding Bishopric,

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Universal redemption through obedi- 
ence — Evil of contentions — Trinity 
of the Godhead — God the Father of 
spirit — Christ the Firstborn — Elo- 
him, Jehovah and Michael in the 
creation — Adam head of the mor- 
tal human race, but not one of the 



Godhead — ■ Preexistence of Jesus 
Christ as Jehovah, a Personage of 
Spirit — Personality of the Holy 
Ghost — Plurality of Gods — Angels 
bearinr name of Deity — Christ the 
Word of God, the Redeemer of the 
World— God the Eternal Father to 
be worshiped and obeyed. 

I feel very much like President 
Smith did this morning in arising 
to address the congregation — I 
have not language to express the 
emotions of my heart in being priv- 
ileged to assemble with you, my 
brethren and sisters, in this great 
congregation of Latter-day Saints. 
I am very thankful to God, our 
Eternal Father, for this blessing, 
and for having the testimony in my 
soul of the truth of those principles 
which were so grandly placed be- 
fore us this morning by our Presi- 
dent. There is nothing in the world 
that I know of which is so dear to 
my heart as the truth which has 
been revealed in these last days 
from God through His servant 
Joseph, the prophet. And when I 
think of the goodness of God to me 
during all the years that I have 
been associated with the Saints and 
labored in the ministry, I feel over- 
whelmed with gratitude and thanks- 
giving and praise. Praise be unto 
God our Eternal Father and His 
Son Jesus Christ and the Holy 
Ghost, and His servants who have 
been called in these last days to lay 
the foundations of the Church and 
Kingdom of our God ! 

I would that all the world could 
see and understand these things as 
we do, but that is at present — I was 
going to say impossible — it can not 
be done at present, but I rejoice in 
the assurance given in the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, in the revelations 
of the Lord to us, that the time will 
come when every knee shall bow 
and every tongue confess that Jesus 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is the Lord, the Christ, to the glory 
of God the Father, and this will 
not be by compulsion or constraint, 
but by the willing desires of those 
who bow, they having been brought 
through sorrow and pain and suf- 
fering, penalties for their sins, into 
a condition ,of repentance and de- 
sire for the truth and a willingness 
to obey it. That to me is a glorious 
prospect. And the work of preach- 
ing the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
which now devolves upon a few, 
will never be consummated entirely 
until that time shall come when 
every soul of Adam's race will have 
the opportunity of receiving and 
bowing to the truth as it is in Jesus 
Christ. 

There is a very great work to be 
performed when we think of that 
which has to be done in this re- 
gard. The gospel must be preached 
to every creature in the flesh and 
afterwards to every person in the 
spirit who has not heard it, until all 
the millions upon millions of the 
race of Adam shall have had the 
opportunity of bowing in obedience 
to the commandments of God and 
coming, to some degree, in com- 
munion with Him. At present, as 
we were told this morning, the duty 
devolves upon the Priesthood of 
this Church, in both its branches, in 
the Melchizedek and Aaronic 
branches of the priesthood, to min- 
ister in the name of the Lord by 
divine authority, and what they do 
under that authority in the way that 
the Lord has commanded is valid, 
and it has power and force in the 
heavens. What they administer on 
earth in the way that the Lord has 
appointed is recognized on high, 
and is of the same force and effect 
as though performed bv Deity. 

The truth which the Lord has re- 
vealed, naturally comes into col- 



lision with error wherever it is 
found, and the time will come when 
all error, all untruth will have to 
give way and the truth will abound. 
It is by the truth that we shall be 
sanctified, that is, by obedience to 
it, as was explained to us today, not 
merely its reception in the mind, but 
its actual possession of us in all our 
being; that we live for the truth 
and by the truth and according to 
the truth and to the degree that we 
do that we become sanctified in our 
nature and come nearer to Him 
who is the fountain of truth, to us. 
Truth itself in the abstract is eter- 
nal, but there have been individuals 
who have been the embodiments of 
the truth and of all that is good and 
great, and our Heavenly Father is 
that embodiment, and Jesus Christ 
also, and the expression of it to us 
of all that is right and true and 
good. The eternal verities are em- 
bodied in them and are communi- 
cated to us as we are willing to re- 
ceive them. When we do receive 
them, not merely in theory, but also 
in practice and make them ours in 
our lives, in our constitution, in our 
very being, so far we approach to- 
wards the perfection of Deity. 

The very first principle of our 
faith, announced in what is called 
the articles of our faith, is that we 
believe in God the Eternal Father, 
and in His Son Jesus Christ, and 
in the Holy Ghost. These three 
separate personalities are placed in 
the very foundation of our faith, as 
its first doctrine or principle, and 
we ought to become thoroughly 
familiar with that which has been 
revealed concerning them and we 
ought to understand them alike. 
One of the very great beauties of 
our Church is that we are coming 
to union — the unity of the faith by 
the knowledge of the truth. When 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W . PENROSE. 



)5 



we know the truth and see it clearly 
we are alike in our perceptions and 
our understandings, and measure- 
ably according to our obedience in 
the government of our own na- 
tures by the truth. Sometimes, how- 
ever, even in the Church of Christ, 
in which we are ''all baptized by 
one spirit into one body, whether 
we be Jew or Gentile, bond or free," 
of every race and tribe and king- 
dom and color, although we are 
baptized by water and by the spirit 
into one body and should be per- 
fectly united, especially in doctrine 
and principle, yet like it was in the 
early Christian Church there are 
sometimes divisions among us in re- 
gard to many important things, and 
sometimes there are very sharp di- 
visions upon thing's that are not so 
important. Our brethren in some 
of their class meetings and quorum 
meeting's, sometimes even in the 
theological departments of the Sun- 
day schools they get divided in 
their opinions in regard to some 
very simple things — I was going to 
say silly things, but I don't want to 
be censorious — some things that are 
not worth spending time over. The 
reason I know about this is because 
T frequently personally receive let- 
ters from good friends in different 
parts of the Church, asking ques- 
tions and declaring that there is a 
division of opinion among our 
brethren in regard to them. And 
the First Presidencv frequently re- 
ceive communications from the 
brethren asking- for a decision on 
certain points that are really not 
worth discussing, that do not 
amount to anything, but there arc 
some things which are important 
for us to understand aright. 

Tt was very clearly shown to us 
this morning that we have one 
Eternal Father and that Jesus 



Christ is His Son, and that we also 
are His sons, with this difference, 
that we are all the sons of God in 
the spirit, that is in the spirit part 
of our nature, but Christ is also 
His Son in the flesh. I do not think 
there is any division of sentiment 
or opinion among our brethren and 
sisters in the Church concerning 
this fact, that the spirit part of man 
— that of course means woman too 
— is the offspring of God, God is 
the Father of our spirits. We 
often emote the saying of Paul, who 
seemed to have a very good idea in 
regard to all these things, or rather, 
if you do not believe that Paul 
wrote the Fpistle to the Hebrews 
as I do — (great dispute about that 
in the world) — in the Epistle to the 
Hebrews we are told that "we have 
had fathers of our flesh who cor- 
rected us and we gave them rever- 
ence," and the question is asked, 
"How much rather should we be in 
subjection to the Father of spirits, 
Heb. 12:9. There are many other 
texts in the old scriptures, in the 
Old Testament and in the New Tes- 
tament, that I will not take time to 
quote this afternoon, because, as I 
have said, I think we are all agreed 
in regard to this one very important 
fact, this very encouraging truth, 
this thing that lifts up the soul of 
man above earthly things to the 
realization that his origin is not 
from the dust but from the Eternal 
God, the Creator, the Ruler, the 
Architect of the universe. He who 
made the worlds, and as we heard 
today, controls and governs and di- 
rects them, is actually our F"ather, 
not in some mystical sense, not in 
some mere theory, but we were be- 
gotten of Him. In the revelation 
contained in the 76th Section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants we are 
told that the inhabitants of the 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



worlds are "begotten sons and 
daughters unto God." There may 
be more in that than we see at the 
first glance, but the result of it all 
is in our minds, if we are at all 
logical, that the great Eternal God 
is our Father and we are begotten 
of Him or UNTO Him and to Him 
we owe allegiance, to Him we owe 
obedience, because He is our Father 
and our God and our King. We 
should obey Him because of His 
parentage to us ; we should obey 
Him because we are His children 
and He has the right to our obedi- 
ence, and being so high and exalted 
and lifted up, He understands us 
better than we understand ourselves 
and He has our destiny in His 
hands and He has power over life 
and over death and we should be 
obedient to Him because of our re- 
lationship to Him. That seems 
clear to me and I believe it is to you 
and to the great body of the Latter- 
day Saints, the Church. 

There still remains, I can tell by 
the letters I have alluded to, an 
Lea among some of the people that 
Adam was and is the Almighty 
and Eternal God. He is the father 
of his race, of course, the great 
patriarch over the human family, 
and being begotten unto him, he 
is the father of us in our earthly 
condition, in our mortality, and 
stands as the primal patriarch. But 
God says He put him there. Now, 
so far as that is concerned that is 
all right. In the 107th Section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, you 
will read about that. Three years 
before his death we are told Adam 
gathered together the majority of 
his posterity who were righteous 
into the valley of Adam-Ondi- 
Ahman, and they rose up and 
bles'sed him and called him Michael 
the prince, the arch-angel, and the 



Lord appeared unto them. Now, 
mark you, there was Adam and his 
posterity, so far as they were 
brought forth at that time, and the 
Lord appeared to them — that 
wasn't Adam, was it? "And the 
Lord administered comfort unto 
Adam and said : I have set thee to 
be at the head" — the head of his 
race, the head of the human family 
in their mortal condition — "I have 
set thee to be at the head ; a multi- 
tude of nations shall come of thee 
and thou art a prince over them 
forever" (verses 53-55). 

Here is Adam with his posterity, 
they recognizing him and acknowl- 
edging him as their patriarch and 
father and prince, and recognizing 
the fact that in his first estate he 
was Michael, recognizing also that 
the Lord appears and declares He 
places Adam at the head. Now, 
Adam had transgressed a law and 
because of that he had to pay the 
penalty, and because of that, death 
came upon his posterity on natural 
principles, (as we will understand 
better when we comprehend fully 
how these things occur, and how 
our tendencies and traits and taints 
are handed down from the fathers 
to the children to the different gen- 
erations that come). But although 
he had transgressed, that had been 
foreseen, and, according to the rev- 
elations that we have, a plan had 
been prepared before this trans- 
gression took place whereby the 
results of it might be removed and 
whereby a blessing might come in 
that very thing that was called "the 
curse." That the knowledge of 
good and evil might come to man- 
kind, that they might have an op- 
portunity of showing whether they 
loved the truth and loved the good 
or loved the evil and the untruth, 
and that they might be judged ac-

cording to their works, and that 
their different capabilities and their 
different degrees of worthiness or 
unworthiness might be exhibited 
and developed and showed forth so 
that justice might be done and that 
mercy might be extended where it 
was needful, that mercy should not 
rob justice and justice should not 
rob mercy, the Lord, in view of the 
fact that a Redeemer had been pre- 
pared from the foundation of the 
world for the redemption of the 
whole human family, in their dif- 
ferent degrees, smiled upon Adam 
and blessed him and placed him at 
the head of his posterity as the 
great patriarch of the race, as a 
prince over them forever. 

Now, because of that and some 
other little matters that might be 
mentioned, the notion has taken 
hold of some of our brethren that 
Adam is the being that we should 
worship. This has been explained, 
I think, from this stand several 
times, but notwithstanding that, 
peculiar ideas get into people's 
minds, not always becausethey are 
stubborn and wilfull and wicked or 
that they desire anything that is 
wrong, but because it gets into their 
heads and it is a very hard job to 
get it out of their heads, like the 
Scotchman who asked the Lord to 
keep him in the right path so that 
he might not go "wrang, for the 
Lord knew that if he once got any- 
thing into his head, it would be a 
mighty hard job to get it out of 
him." That is the way it is with 
lots of our folks, not because they 
are all Scotchmen, however, the 
idea has obtained in the minds of 
some of the brethren and we ought 
to get right concerning it. I am 
sorry that has not been rectified 
long ago, because plain answers 
have been given to brethren and 



sisters who write and desire to 
know about it, and yet it still lin- 
gers, and contentions arise in re- 
gard to it, and there should be no 
contentions among the Latter-day 
Saints. It is all right for people to 
have their own views and express 
them, if they will do it in a proper 
spirit ; it is all right for people to 
stand up for what they really be- 
lieve to be true, but when this spirit 
of contention comes, then, as we 
are told in the Book of Mormon, it 
is of the devil. 

Now, if Adam, as claimed by 
some of our brethren, is the being 
that we should worship, to whom 
we should pray, who was that per- 
son that put Adam at the head of 
his race ? Who was the person that 
Adam prayed to ? Adam prayed to 
God and we are told, as we can find 
in the Pearl of Great Price, which 
gives us a great deal of information 
on this matter, as revealed to 
Moses, and as revealed to Enoch, 
that Adam, after his transgression, 
was taught the gospel, the same 
gospel that we have, and the Lord 
said He would not suffer that Adam 
should die as to the temporal death 
until He "sent forth angels to pro- 
claim faith and redemption through 
the name of His Only Begotten 
Son" (see Doc. and Cov. Sec. 29). 
So that Adam had to believe and re- 
pent and be baptized as we have to 
do, and we are told that he was bap- 
tized "in the name of the Father 
and of the Son and of the Holy 
Ghost." So Adam was neither the 
Father, nor the Son, nor the Holv 
Ghost, was he? Then, who was he? 
Why, we are told he was Michael 
in his first estate, and as Adam he 
will stand at the head of his race. 
Daniel saw him "in the night vis- 
ion" — Michael who was the arch- 
angel before he came here. Re-'

member when you talk about Adam, 
that name only applies to the man 
Adam on the earth with a body 
made out of the dust, but Michael, 
the archangel, the Ancient of days 
did sit ; so Daniel saw, and "ten 
thousand times ten thousand stood 
before him." And, then, we are 
told, "One like the Son of Man 
came in the clouds of heaven and 
was brought before the Ancient of 
days, and there was given Him do- 
minion and an everlasting kingdom 
that all people should serve him" 
(Daniel 7:9-14). We will find that 
this will be the case ; for when we 
learn a little more about this per- 
son — the Son of Man — we will see 
that this is His due — that He will 
be at the head of the Kingdom ; He 
will be King of kings, and Lord of 
lords. He is "the first and the last," 
so He proclaims. You will find it 
in the Old Testament and in the 
New, and in the Book of Mormon, 
and in the Pearl of Great Price, 
that He is "The First and the last" 
and that all things were made by 
Him and they are of Him and 
through Him and for Him. 

Now, who is this person, this 
Jesus Christ? Is He Adam or a 
son of Adam? Not at all, except 
in the sense that Jesus of Nazareth 
was born of Mary, and therein was 
His humanity and that is traced 
right up to Adam, of course, in the 
scriptural genealogy. But who was 
the Father of Jesus Christ before 
He came on the earth in the flesh? 
We read in the Book of Mormon 
that when He appeared to the Ne- 
phites on this continent, He told 
them that He was the person that 
gave the law unto Moses. Who 
was it that gave the law to Moses ? 
We are told it was Jehovah. Well, 
was Jesus Jehovah? Yes, accord- 
ing to the scriptures, both ancient 



and modern, and that seems to be a 
stumbling block in the way of a few 
of our brethren. (See Doc. and 
Cov., Sec. 10:3, 4.) We are told by 
revelation that in the creation of the 
earth there were three individuals, 
personally engaged. This is more 
particularly for the Temple of God, 
but sufficient of it has been pub- 
lished over and over again to per- 
mit me to refer to it. Elohim, — not 
Floheim, as we spell it sometimes — 
that is a plural word meaning the 
gods, but it is attached to the indi- 
vidual who is the Father of all, the 
person whom we look to as the 
great Eternal Father. Elohim, 
Jehovah and Michael, were en- 
gaged in the construction of this 
globe. Jehovah, commanded by 
Elohim, went down to where there 
was space, saying to Michael : "Let 
us go down, for there is space there, 
and we will organize an earth 
whereon these [the spirits that are 
around us] may dwell, and we will 
prove them herewith to see if they 
will do all things whatsoever the 
Lord their God shall command 
them." You can read about that in 
the Pearl of Great Price — Book of 
Abraham, chapter 3. Now, when the 
work was done, which you read 
about in the Book of Genesis and 
more particularly in the Book of 
Moses and in the Book of Abraham 
in the Pearl of Great Price, when 
that was done. Michael became 
Adam and was placed in the Garden 
of Eden, as we read in ancient and 
modern revelations, and Eve was 
given to him to be his wife, bone of 
his bone and flesh of his flesh, and 
it is announced that no man should 
put asunder that which God had 
joined together. 

You see, do you not, that Michael 
became Adam and that Adam was 
not the Son Jehovah, and he was

19 



not Elohim the Father. He occu- 
pied his own place and position in 
the organization of the earth and in 
the production of mortal beings on 
the earth. Jesus of Nazareth was 
the Jehovah who was engaged with 
the Father in the beginning, and we 
are told in the 93rd Section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants that Jesus 
says concerning Himself, "I also 
was in the beginning with the 
Father and am the first-born." "Ye 
were also in the beginning with the 
Father, that which is spirit." That 
part of us which is spirit, was in 
the beginning with God, because 
we are His children and Jesus was 
there, the person that is called Jesus 
in the flesh, and He was the first- 
born, that is how He is the first. 
"I am the first and the last. I am 
Alpha and Omega, the beginning 
and the end." He was the begin- 
ning of the spirits who people this 
earth, "the beginning of the creation 
of God," as we read in the Colos- 
sians and in the Book of Revela- 
tion, "the first-born of every crea- 
ture" in the spirit. But, in the flesh 
He was the "Only Begotten Son" 
of the Father. Mary was his 
mother. She was of the House of 
David and therefore Jesus fulfilled 
the prediction that the Messiah was 
to be of the House of David, and of 
the seed of Abraham, and the seed 
of the woman who should bruise 
the serpent's head, as we read in 
the Book of Genesis. 3:15. 

I want to draw a clear distinction 
between these individuals that wc 
may stop this discussion that is go- 
ing on to no purpose. Who is 
Adam? Adam is our father, cer- 
tainly. He is the great father of 
the race, but we have had fathers 
that corrected us at home and we 
gave them reverence. Yes, that is 
right, but do we worship them and 



pray to them ? Oh, no. Then why 
should we want to pray to Adam, 
who away back in the remote cen- 
turies was at the head of his race 
and in that sense is our father? He 
occupies the place that he was ex- 
pected to occupy and did the work 
he was expected to perform, but 
after he transgressed and brought 
death into the world, "as by one 
man's disobedience death came into 
the world so by one man's obedience 
and righteousness life came into the 
world. So that "as in Aclam all die, 
even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive," all be resurrected, every one, 
bad and good and indifferent, all 
races and colors, and sizes and ages 
as they were laid down, so they will 
come forth, and it is through the 
power of the resurrection in Jesus 
Christ that they come forth. 

Let us cite the Book of John the 
Apostle, it is a splendid thesis. The 
Lord refers to it in the 93rd Sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
wherein John proclaimed that Jesus 
was in the beginning with God. He 
says : "In the beginning was the 
Word, and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God. All things 
were made by Him, and without 
Him was not anything made that 
was made," and Jesus declares in 
this revelation, 93rd section, that 
He was the person called the Word. 
He was not merely the word com- 
ing from the mouth of God, but He 
was the expression of the Father, 
He was the expression of God's 
word and will. All things are of 
God, as Paul said, and we of Him 
and all things by Jesus Christ and 
we by Him. When Joseph the 
prophet received his first manifes- 
tation from God, the Father and the 
Son appeared. The Father did not 
say a great deal, but we shall find 
that has been His course from the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



very beginning, because the Son 
was His Word. He declared : 
"This is my beloved Son, hear 
Him." And He, the Son, was that 
being, as He told the Nephites, who 
gave the law to Moses (3 Nephi 
15:5) and He was the Being who 
had charge of matters from the 
very beginning. In the Deity there 
are the Father and the Son and the 
Holy Ghost, and our father Adam 
was baptized in their holy name and 
he is not either one of them. Just 
remember that. 

In the fifth chapter of the Gospel 
according to St. John, Jesus speaks 
very clearly on matters that may 
seem mysterious to some people. 
You know there are some of our 
brethren who have thought that 
Jesus, in His first estate, as we call 
it, or in His former state, was a 
resurrected being. I do not know 
where they get the idea from, but 
it is likely from this, that He was 
called God by John the Revelator 
and by a great number of writers in 
the Book of Mormon and in the 
Doctrine and Covenants and in 
other revelations. "He was in the 
beginning with God, and was God ;" 
and He could not be a god, they 
say, unless He had a body, had 
passed through mortality and had 
been resurrected. What scripture 
did they find to suggest that no- 
tion? I don't know of any revela- 
tion that declares it. I don't know 
of any that intimates at all that He 
could not be God unless He had 
passed through a mortal probation 
and had been tried and tempted and 
had suffered ; that He could not be 
God beforehand ; but we are told 
that in the beginning He was with 
God, and He says that the Father 
had shown Him all things that He 
Himself doeth. That is in the fifth 
chapter of the Gospel according to 



St. John. I will not take time to 
stop and turn to it. You read it. 
He was in conversation with some 
of the Pharisees, and they did not 
like His proclamining Himself to 
be the Son of God. " In the 10th 
chapter it is said they took up stones 
to throw at Him because He said 
He was the Son of God. And Jesus 
proclaimed the truth that there are 
several persons called God, just as 
Paul does in his First Epistle to 
the Corinthians. (Chapter 8:5, 6.) 
"Though there be many that are 
called gods, whether in heaven or 
in earth," says Paul, "as there be 
gods many and lords many. But 
to us there is but one God, the 
Father of whom are all things and 
we in Him and one Lord, Jesus 
Christ, by whom are all things, and 
we by Him." Jesus quoted the 
Psalms in regard to this. The 
Psalmist said, "I have said ye are 
gods, and all of you are children of 
the most high." (82:6.) Now, 
said Jesus, if he called them Gods, 
to whom the word of the Lord 
came, why do you find fault with 
me and desire to stone me for say- 
ing that I am the son of God? In 
the Psalm 82 it begins, "God stand- 
eth in the congregation of the 
mightv. Pie judgeth among the 
gods." 

There are gods many and lords 
many, but unto us, for our obedi- 
ence and our worship, and our ad- 
herence to His word, there is one 
living and true God -the Creator of 
this and many other worlds, and 
we look to Him as the author of 
our life, by and through His Be- 
loved Son, who was with Him from 
the beginning. The Holy Ghost is 
a personage of spirit as we are told, 
in the 130th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, the Father is a per- 
son with a body of flesh and bones, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 



21 



and. the Son also, (He is now, un- 
doubtedly), and the Holy Ghost is 
a personage of spirit. Now that 
1 Joly Ghost, a personage of spirit, 
is also called God. Take the 20th 
Section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. In the laying of the very 
foundation of the organization of 
the Church it is declared most dis- 
tinctly that, "The Father, Son and 
Holy Ghost, are one God." Just 
as in the presidency of a stake or 
of a quorum or of the Church there 
are three distinct and separate in- 
dividuals, but one presidency of the 
quorum, or of the stake, or of the 
Church, so there are three separate 
and distinct persons, the Father and 
the Son and the Holy Ghost, as one 
Deity. Now who is the Son? The 
first-born, the beloved Son of God, 
whom He put at the head of all 
things, the heir of all things "by 
whom also He made the worlds." 
I am quoting scripture. Now, 
when God the Father placed Jesus 
Christ in a position, or placed Je- 
hovah in any position and gave 
Him commandment to do this that 
and the other, He would not tell 
Him to do anything that He could 
not do. That is one of the fun- 
damentals of our Gospel. "Surely 
the Lord God will command noth- 
ing of the children of men but He 
prepareth a way whereby they can 
accomplish it." God gave full 
power and authority to Jesus 
Christ, as we call Him now, that is 
His name, and He was named be- 
forehand in the revelations of God,, 
as we can read in the Pearl of Great 
Price, His Beloved Son, He was 
with Him from the beginning. He 
was obedient in all things. He did 
no wrong when He was in that con- 
dition, nor when He was in the 
body. He as innocent of any trans- 
gression. He loved righteousness. 



He hated iniquity; and "therefore 
God anointed Him with the oil of 
gladness above His fellows." 

How many millions of ages ago 
it was when He became the first- 
born, I don't know ; it is not re- 
vealed. A great many things con- 
cerning our history before we came 
here are not revealed and will not 
be, perhaps, until we get into a 
further state of progression ; but 
the Father placed His Son, His 
"Beloved Son," to look after the 
affairs of this world and to direct 
them, and He was in the creation, 
as I have explained and as I have 
quoted from the scriptures. In 
this Sth Chapter of John, Jesus 
goes on to explain to the people 
that He did nothing of Himself, 
but that which the Father sent Him 
to do, that Fie -did; and He said, 
"The Son doeth nothing but what 
He seeth the Father do, for the 
Father loveth the Son and showeth 
Him all things that He Himself 
doeth." (verse 20.) Now, if the 
Father, in the course of His great 
experience as revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph, had passed through 
the "estate" of mortals that He 
might be placed in the same condi- 
tions of trial, so was Jesus thus 
placed, and the Lord showed to 
Jesus all about this. He showed to 
Him all about the organization of 
the worlds. "The Father loveth 
the Son and showeth Him all things 
that He Himself doeth, and He will 
show Him greater works than 
these, that ye may marvel ;" so we 
read. Then He goes on to tell, in 
regard to the resurrection, from the 
dead, what will become of all peo- 
ple. All being brought forth from 
their graves through His power as 
"the resurrection and the life," 
some to eternal life and glory and 
some to everlasting condemnation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



That being the case. He understood 
all about it by sight, and the time 
being set when lie should come to 
the earth and take a body, He was 
qualified to do that for which He 
was appointed in the beginning. 
We need not have any dubiety 
about His understanding all that. 
There is no need for the theory that 
He must have had a body before 
coming to this earth, and there is 
nothing that establishes it by reve- 
lation. The mere opinions of men 
do not count for very much. 

The Holy Ghost as "a personage 
of spirit," whom Jesus Christ said 
he would send from the Father, and 
who would not come unless Jesus 
went away (John 16:7) was not 
and is not a "being of tabernacle," 
but, without a body of flesh and 
bones, he represents both the Fath- 
er and the Son and is one ot the 
Godhead. (I John 5:7.) The 
Holy Trinity operate by the power 
and presence of the Divine spirit 
which permeates all things and is 
the life and the light of all things. 
Thus our Father is everywhere 
present, while as an individual He 
dwells in heaven "in the midst of 
all things," and so with the other 
personages in the Godhead. 

If you will read the first and sec- 
ond chapters of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews, you will learn there that 
it became necessary, in order to 
lead many sons unto glory and sal- 
vation, that Jesus, who was made a 
little lower than the angels, should 
be in all points as they are. Tf that 
is so, then he was a spirit in the 
spirit world when we were spirits 
and He was the first-born. There- 
fore it says, "as the children are 
made partakers of flesh and blood, 
He also Himself likewise took part 
of the same," so that He might 
puffer temptations like the rest, that 



He might pass through all these 
conditions of mortality in His own 
experience, and be raised from the 
dead. "Wherefore in all things it_ 
behoved Him to be made like unto 
Hi^-brethren." (Heb. 2:14-17.) 

One other point in regard to it: 
When Jesus was on the cross, what 
did He say just before His last, 
expiring moment? "Father, into 
Thy hands I commend my spirit !" 
and having said thus He gave up 
the ghost.." (Luke 23:26.) He 
was a spirit dwelling in a mortal 
body and He gave up the spirit just 
like we have to — "g ; ave up the 
ghost." As I said, He was the first 
of all and He will be the last, be- 
cause when He receives the king- 
dom from the Ancient of Days, 
after it is all purified and perfected, 
and the earth is redeemed, and the 
inhabitants thereof are cleansed 
from their transgressions through 
His atonement, He will present the 
kingdom to the Father. "The first 
and the last !" He is the only be- 
gotten of the Father in the flesh, 
the first begotten in the spirit, a 
great and mighty Being. He 
wrought more wonders when He 
came on the earth than we have 
any understanding of. He was the 
Mighty God, as proclaimed by the 
Prophet Isaiah,, the Wonderful 
Counselor, the Everlasting Father, 
the Prince of Peace, whom we can 
gladly adore. When we pray, we 
are told directly how to pray, and a 
sample is given to us in the blessing 
of the bread and of the water in the 
sacrament: "Oh, God, the Eternal 
Father, we ask Thee in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Thy Son," so and 
so ; that is the pattern for our 
prayers. We pray to the Eternal 
Father, whom we have named 
Elohim. We pray to Him in the 
name of Jesus Christ, for Jesus 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE.

Christ is His Word, He is the ex- 
pression of God's will, He was 
with the Father in the beginning. 
The Father has placed His name 
upon Him. God sometimes places 
His name in angelic beings, min- 
istering spirits, as you can read in 
the first chapter of Revelation and 
the first verse : "The revelation of 
Jesus Christ which God gave to 
Him to show unto His servant 
things which must shortly come to 
pass, and He sent by His angel and 
delivered it to His servant, John." 
In the last chapter of the Book we 
read about John bowing to worship 
that being but he told him not to 
do it, for he was one of his fel- 
low-servants and of his brethren, 
the prophets." Then the angel 
said, "I am Alpha and Omega, the 
beginnig and the end, the first and 
the last." (Rev. 22:13.) Well, 
was He? He was speaking for 
Jesus, the Christ, as Christ speaks 
for the Father when He is so ap- 
pointed. See also the appointment 
of the angel spoken of in Kxodus 
23 :20 : "Behold I send an angel be- 
fore thee to keep thee in the way. 
Beware of him and obey his voice : 
provoke him not for he will not 
pardon your transgressions for My 
Name is in him." 

There isn't time for me to go any 
further on this matter. I have taken 
up a great deal more time than I 
had intended to do, but I have start- 
ed on this point and it is for the 
purpose that we may avoid conten- 
tions and discussions that arise 
among us for no needful purpose. 
God the Eternal Father who made 
the world, by and through Jesus 
Christ, is our Father and our God 
and we worship and adore Him. 
and as we have been taught to do 
today we should obey Him. That 
is the great point. Take His word 



and live by it. Live by every word 
that comes from the mouth of 
God. Jesus taught that "a man 
shall not live by bread alone, but 
by every word that proceedeth from 
the mouth of God." J_esus_of 
Nazareth^ bom of the virgin Mary, 
was literally and truly the Son of 
the Father, the Eternal God, not 
of Adam. Don't think so for a 
moment. Christ was the Son of 
God, of God the Father ; the Father 
of His Spirit was the Father of His 
body. He was an exalted man who 
had passed through all things that 
Jesus Christ, His Beloved Son, 
afterwards passed through. It was 
a repetition of the things that had 
been done from remote, eternal 
ages, the great plan of salvation 
for all the people of all the worlds 
that God has created. He is not a 
mere force or etherial immateriality, 
but is the embodiment in His per- 
sonality of light, truth, virtue, jus- 
tice, mercy, energy and all the eter- 
nal verities. 

God help us to see and under- 
stand the truth and to avoid error ! 
And don't let us be too strong in 
our feelings in regard to our opin- 
ions of matters. Let us try to be 
right. I have prayed from a boy, 
when I first heard the Gospel, that 
I might see the truth as God sees it, 
that I might have it as it really is, 
and the Lord has blessed me in 
answer to that prayer. I don't pre- 
tend to say that I do not make mis- 
takes like other people do. I don't 
mean that, but I mean that my 
heart is set to find out the right and 
the truth ; and while "God moves in 
a mysterious way His wonders to 
perform," I don't expect to have 
made known to me anything that 
should not be revealed, but the 
things that have been revealed I 
have studied and reflected upon and

prayed about, and I know that the 
light of God, by the power of the 
Holy Ghost, has rested upon me and 
qualified me in my labors and lit up 
my soul with the light of eternity 
and drawn me nearer to Him. He 
is my Father and my God. And 
I venerate and rejoice in the atone- 
ment of Jesus Christ His Son and 
believe in Him with all my heart. 
Jesus of Nazareth, who was put to 
death on the cross, is the Son of 
God in the spirit and in the body. 
He is, therefore, our elder brother, 
and we should follow Him and em- 
ulate His example, embody all His 
virtues as near as we can, for He 
is our head over this Church, the 
living spiritual head. He made it, 
he organized it under the direction 
of the Holy One, our great Eternal 
Father. And now, praise and glory 
be unto God the Father, and to His 
Son Jesus Christ and to the Holy 
Ghost, who speaks for both the 
Father and the Son and is with the 
Church to enlighten it by the power 
of the Eternal spirit, even so. 
Amen. 

A duet, entitled, "Stay Thou with 
me," was sung by Geneva Harris 
and James H. Neilson ; words and

PREST. FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Temporal salvation of our people 
carefully considered — Worthy and 
capable persons selected for Church 
offices — Each President of Church 
specially qualified for -time of min- 
istry — Astonishing outlay by Church 
for educational purposes, etc., — Suc- 
cessful efforts in home industries — 
Great advantages in obeying Word 
of Wisdom — Honest tithe-payers 
also pay their debts — The habit of 
saving inculcated. 

I feel very grateful for our pres- 
ence on this occasion and for the 



splendid Spirit that has attended the 
First Presidency in their discourses 
to us today, for they have been su- 
perior. They always talk well, but 
I feel that they have talked a little 
better today than usual. I am sure 
that the Latter-day Saints have felt 
fed with the word of the Lord. Our 
understanding of the Gospel has 
been enlightened, and our faith 
strengthened ; and I trust that we 
will do better in the future, serve 
the Lord more perfectly and have 
His favor and fellowship abiding 
always with us. 

I am reminded occasionally, as I 
presume all the brethren are, of the 
necessity of employment for the 
Latter-day Saints. I suppose the 
Presiding Bishopric are advised of 
these necessities and are doing ev- 
erything in their power to find la- 
bor for those who are unemployed. 
In our state, as I suppose in other 
states as well, there are armies of 
people quite generally at labor, and 
yet always some needing employ- 
ment. We are admonished of the 
necessity of production from the 
rich soils that we enjoy and the re- 
sources about us to provide for the 
temporal salvation of the people; 
for we not only need salvation spir- 
itually but we need salvation tem- 
porally. I thought of this today, 
when looking over one of the reve- 
lations in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that refers particularly to the 
temporal salvation of the people. I 
was led, a few weeks ago, at one or 
two different conferences, to draw 
the attention of the presiding breth- 
ren and the people generally to the 
temporal salvation that is necessary 
for us ; and I believe that it is not 
only good for Latter-day Saints but 
for everybody in the world. It is 
a doctrine that secures temporal sal- 
vation and prosperity to all people

who will observe it. It has been 
given to us now for a great many 
years, at least, before I was born, 
and has been before us. It has been 
taught us continuously and we have 
undertaken to observe it, and have 
done so fairly well in very many 
instances. Still, hardly any of us 
have been quite perfect in that law. 
I don't know that there is any other 
revelation in which that same ex-, 
pression is used, except the one — a 
revelation for the temporal salva- 
tion of the Saints, and yet applica- 
ble and good to everybody else. I 
have discovered also that many oth- 
er people have been imbued with 
this doctrine and principle, and are 
advocating it. It looks to me as 
though the Lord was working 
among the children of men for 
their temporal salvation as well as 
ours. I thank the Lord for this 
word and will, doctrine and coun- 
sel, which He gave to us so early in 
our history, and I thank Him for 
the hold it has upon the Latter-day 
Saints. I am proud to discover, as 
I have been able to do, that our 
chief brethren at home and abroad, 
those who are entrusted with re- 
sponsibility and are required to be 
the shepherds of the people, and 
who stand as men sounding a note 
of warning upon the walls of Zion, 
for the welfare of the people — that 
these men as a rule are well estab- 
lished in the faith and in the prac- 
tice of the doctrine I refer to. 

I listened on fast day to a very 
excellent discourse by President 
Smith in which he drew our atten- 
tion to the splendid elements that 
have been developed in our poster- 
ity, in our children, who are born 
unto the Lord under the new cov- 
enant; to the integrity that has been 
inherited by them, and how reliable 
and trusty and true they are to the 



cause of Zion. I appreciated it, as 
I am sure all did who heard him 
speak. Since that my mind has 
been turned also to the field of la- 
bor which I have been in since I 
was twenty years of age ; practically- 
all my life, so far as that is con- 
cerned ; but since I was twenty 
years of age it has fallen to my lot 
to be associated with leading breth- 
ren, presiding brethren in quorums 
and wards, and in stakes and mis- 
sions. I want to say that the testi- 
mony given by President Smith in 
regard to the results of our family 
relations, the fruit that has been 
produced under the covenant, the 
reliability and trustworthiness of 
our children, can also be borne con- 
cerning the remainder of those 
brethren and sisters, produced 
among the Latter-day Saints, who 
hold responsible positions. And a 
feature that I discover and bear in 
mind is that in our organization, so 
complete and so perfect, so valu- 
able and so saving in its nature, it 
is the rule that we seek always, un- 
der the direction of the Lord and 
His counsel, for the very choicest 
and best men and women for posi- 
tions of responsibility ; and I want 
to bear this testimony in the pres- 
ence of this congregation, that al- 
most universally, we have been well 
satisfied, and have rarely ever made 
a mistake. It is very seldom that 
we find a brother or a sister who is 
not trustworthy. I want to say this 
for those upon whom this authority 
and responsibility rest at this time. 
There may be quite a percentage 
who are not, possibly, doing the 
very best they can, yet are all strug- 
gling to do the right thing. But 
when we go into the field we never 
find competition among the breth- 
ren and sisters to see who shall ob- 
tain positions of responsibility. We 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



do in politics, but not in any of our 
religious organizations. In the 
wards and in the stakes of Zion, in 
the councils and quorums and asso- 
ciations and departments of Zion, 
we take time to deliberate, to con- 
sider carefully, and to weigh men 
and women for positions, and al- 
ways try to find the best suited, the 
best qualified, those that fit the posi- 
tion and responsibility best. We 
have done that and are doing it all 
the time ; and it is a delightful thing 
to us that there is no struggle one 
against another and no anxiety to 
see which shall overcome. We ad- 
vise with our brethren and sisters 
in regard to the positions in which 
they are interested ; and I want to 
say in their behalf that it is a very 
rare thing, I can hardly tell when 
one has been censured, or fault 
found with. Changes are made, 
must be, necessarily so, occasion- 
ally, as circumstances require on 
account of removal of people or the 
arising of new conditions ; but it is 
a rare thing that one is ever dis- 
missed because of transgression, 
either at home or abroad. I want- 
ed to say that much for the record 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

When I heard the President's 
report as to what has been accom- 
plished in fourteen years, I was 
brought to remember that his ad- 
ministration is just about the same 
length as the Prophet Joseph's, just 
about fourteen years. I have, dur- 
ing the last few months, referred on 
some occasions to the various ad- 
ministrations. There have been no 
two of them alike. There never has 
been one just like the present, never 
was one just like President Snow's, 
never one just like President Wood- 
ruff's ; never one just like President 
Taylor's; never one just like Pres- 
ident Young's, never one just like 



the Prophet Joseph's. His was the 
first, laying the foundation. He 
was the law-giver, giving the word 
and will of God, and establishing 
it and perpetuating it to his succes- 
sors and the Church. I spoke of 
these administrations and I felt as 
though it was very proper I should. 
There may be those here present 
who heard me speak on that sub- 
ject. I would not wonder if there 
were; but I drew attention to the 
fact that every administration had 
its peculiar features, for which it 
has been remarkable, and that this 
administration is the administra- 
tion for building, at home and 
abroad, and the establishment of 
Church schools and their support. 
It is astonishing the amount that we 
have done for the cause of educa- 
tion. We have all helped with our 
tithing and offerings, our labors and 
our intelligence. We have done 
marvels ; no people in the world that 
have made such an effort in regard 
to Sunday schools and the training 
of young people. I sometimes think 
we have pretty near overdone, by 
the efforts we have made, and there 
is a rule to regulate and put every- 
thing in order as it should be so 
that no one could slip out or be lost. 
The efforts of splendid scholarly 
men who are gathered together in 
our general boards and associations, 
the best that we have among the 
people, with all the advantages that 
can be brought to their assistance, 
are being employed now for the 
benefit of the rising generation. 

It is astonishing what is being 
accomplished, but I want to say just 
briefly that it is very desirable for 
the temporal salvation of the Latter- 
day Saints and of the people of our 
state. (I speak of the Latter-day 
Saints because we are talking of 
them, and to them, and our work

is with them ; but we are also with 
the people of the state), it is neces- 
sary for the temporal salvation of 
the people of our state that there 
should be employment and home in- 
dustries established. The earth 
should be cultivated and give fortli 
its rich fruits in all the various lines 
that are necessary. We have done 
wonders in a few lines — just what 
should be done in very many others. 
The sugar industry is one of the 
most prominent achievements. It 
was the ideal thought apparently of 
President Young in his day, and of 
President Taylor following him, 
both of them together making ef- 
forts for that purpose. It just 
seemed as though it was the most 
important industry, more important 
than anything else that could be 
established. And now it has been 
made a grand success. Now, those 
who grow the fruit, and vegetables 
should arrange for canning and 
taking care of them and supplying 
them to our neighbors ; instead of 
our buying from our California 
neighbors and other neighbors, we 
want to be selling to them. We 
want to do the same and make the 
same success in the canning and 
taking care of fruits and meats that 
we have done in the sugar business, 
so that we shall bring means into 
the country, furnish employment, 
that there shall be nobody in Zion 
without labor, but all have some- 
thing to do, to remunerate them. 

Then further, I want us to bear 
in mind this doctrine that I have 
been referring to. I shall not read 
the whole revelation but just a little 
of it that was given for the especial 
temporal salvation of the people, 
and I would like to emphasize some 
parts of this revelation that possi- 
bly we have not thought so much of 
as we should do ; for it is given not 



only that we may have health and 
strength in our bodies and live a 
long time, that the destroyer may 
pass us by as he did in the days of 
Israel, but it is for our temporal 
salvation, that is, that we should 
have all our temporal necessities 
met and that we should not be clam- 
oring as of the poor and those that 
are needy. 

SECTION 89. 

Revelation Given Through Joseph, 
the Seer, at Kirtland, Geauga 
County, Ohio, February 27th, 1833. 

1. A Word of Wisdom, for the 
benefit of the Council of High Priests, 
assembled in Kirtland, and church; 
and also the Saints in Zion. 

2. To be sent greeting — not by 
commandment or constraint, but by 
revelation and the word of wisdom, 
showing forth the order and will of 
God in the temporal salvation of all 
saints in the last days. 

3. Given for a principle with prom- 
ise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all saints, 
who are or can be called saints. 

4. Behold, verily, thus saith the 
Lord unto you, in consequence of 
evils and designs which do and will 
exist in the hearts of conspiring men 
in the last days, I have warned you, 
and forewarn you, by giving unto you 
this word of wisdom by revelation, 

5. That inasmuch as any man 
drinketh wine or strong drink among 
you, behold it is not good, neither 
meet in the sight of your Father, only 
in assembling yourselves together to 
offer up your sacraments before Him. 

6. And, behold, this should be 
wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of 
the vine, of your own make. 

7. And, again, strong drinks are 
not for the belly, but for the washing 
of your bodies. 

8. And again, tobacco is not for 
the body, neither for the belly, and is 
not good for man, but is an herb for 
bruises and all sick cattle, to be used 
with judgment and skill. 

9. And again, hot drinks are not 
for the body or belly. 

10- And again, verily T say unto 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



you, all wholesome herbs .God hath 
ordained for the constitution, nature, 
and use of man. 

11. Every herb in the season 
thereof, and every fruit in the season 
thereof; all these to be used with pru- 
dence and thanksgiving. 

12. Yea, flesh also of beasts and 
of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, 
have ordained for the use of man with 
thanksgiving; nevertheless they are 
to be used sparingly; etc. 

And the things that are thus for- 
bidden in the law, — strong drinks 
and wine, and tea and coffee, 
(called hot drinks that were in 
vogue in the days when this revela- 
tion was given), and tobacco, — 
these things that are expensive, ex- 
travagant, destructive of life and 
health and destructive of means, it 
is more than wasteful, it is very 
serious and dangerous to the peo- 
ple to indulge in them, and they 
tend to poverty. They may be of 
some profit to those who deal in 
them, those who buy and sell them, 
but it is poverty to most of those 
who engage in the use of these 
things, which are altogether worth- 
less, improper and wicked, injuri- 
ous, hurtful, taking life, shortening 
life and giving us trouble. For if 
the tea and coffee, and the tobacco 
and the liquor and the beer that are 
used in our state, were let alone 
and the means turned to its proper 
use and purpose, everybody would 
be suitably clothed, suitably housed, 
and all our obligations would be 
reasonably met, and we would not 
be in debt. We would be out of 
debt and have everything that we 
require, instead of suffering and 
having those among us begging for 
employment. We would know how 
to save our little means, as it should 
be taken care of. For the tobacco 
money and the liquor money and 
the monev for tea and coffee, everv 



('ollar of it, as a rule, should be 
saved, except that which is used for 
medicine, carefully used, as it 
should be in case of sickness ; and 
we would find that the Latter-day 
Saints would be thrifty and pros- 
perous, and we would now be liv- 
ing more perfectly under this law, 
given long before I can remember, 
and which we have struggled to ob- 
serve and done fairly well. As I 
say, the leading men and the lead- 
ing women of the Church as a rule 
have made a splendid effort and 
have set good examples before us. 
I was delighted, in regard to our 
financial matters, to find what the 
President has reported today, the 
truth in regard to what has been 
accomplished in fourteen years. 
Only fourteen years ago, if you 
will remember, the Church had 
passed through a very serious 
struggle under the administration 
of President John Taylor and Pres- 
ident Wilforcl Woodruff ; and when 
it came to the inauguration of 
President Snow's administration, it 
was the burning question with the 
leaders of this Church, to know 
what to do and how to do it, to re- 
deem our obligations. Brethren had 
to come to the rescue of the Church 
at that time and before, as the 
Church was embarrassed and was 
struggling under difficulties. But 
when the Lord in simple language 
to President Snow, said, "Let my 
people pay their tithing," and the 
people responded in such measure 
that, as reported by the President 
here, in 1906 we met our obliga- 
tions and have been in good con- 
dition ever since. And those who 
have been faithful in the meeting 
of their obligations to the Lord 
have also, I have no doubt, been 
faithful in their obligations to their 
brethren ; for it is as great a virtue 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



29 



for a man to do by his brother as 
he would do by the Lord. His 
obligations to his brother are just 
as sacred as the obligations to the 
Lord. Hence you will find, as a 
rule, those who are very strict and 
careful in regard to settling with 
the Lord and in due season thereof, 
will do the same with their breth- 
ren, so that our neighbors will not 
suffer because of what we owe 
them. Our merchants, bankers, 
and business men will receive their 
own ; those that labor for us, build 
for us, we will meet these obliga- 
tions honorably, and thus the cir- 
culating medium will pass with the 
people and all our obligations be 
met, and the necessities of those 
who help us will be met also. Hence, 
I want to exhort my brethren and 
sisters, that we remember this law 
and that we observe it so that we 
shall have the sinews of life and of 
business that are necessary to meet 
the requirements of our present 
condition. 

It takes a world of means to 
supply our missionary field. I don't 
know that the President quite gave 
us that information, but you woul 1 
be astonished if the figures were 
shown to you of what it costs to 
handle the missionary work of the 
Latter-day Saints : including the 
time of the men, and the means that 
they have to furnish, to pay their 
own expenses. It amounts to 
figures of larjje proportions. The 
Twelve are laboring constantly to 
try and have the brethren be just 
as economical and careful as they 
can in their ministry. 

We want to be economical and 
careful in our home ministry, in our 
affairs at home, and every man and 
everv woman should have faith 
enough in their employment and in 
their posterity to lay by a little 



something in the savings depart- 
ment, so that they always have 
something ahead instead of always 
being in debt. I teach that lesson 
to the boys, I teach it to the girls, 
so that when they start in life they 
start with the understanding that 
it is possible for them to save a 
little something. And I want to 
tell you what to save — save all the 
tea and coffee money, all the to- 
bacco .money, every dollar of it, 
every dollar of the beer and liquor 
and whisky money. Let no money- 
go for these things at all. I fear 
that sometimes young people are 
growing up with an inclination to 
using those things that are forbid- 
den. They should be restrained. 
We should take great care with our 
children, and with our neighbors, 
and with each other to prevent the 
waste of means upon those things 
that are destructive to human life 
and destructive to our temporal in- 
terests. Let us look out and be 
careful in this regard. Let the 
Latter-day Saints take this warning 
and advice and see that there is a 
saving in this respect ; for in the 
way of every family, there is none 
so poor but what there are times 
and opportunities where something 
can be saved. No family so poor, 
if they are so inclined, but what 
they can furnish tea and coffee, and 
no man so poor that he can't buy 
his cigar or tobacco or cigarette ; 
no man so poor that cannot find 
his beer and his liquor if it is in the 
country. They have resources to 
meet those things, and those are 
the resources that should be turned 
to savings accounts, so that all may 
have something to help them on a 
"rainy day" and in times of sick- 
ness. I want to make that exhorta- 
tion in your presence, my brethren 
and sisters, and trust that the Lat- 



MO

ter-day Saints may profit thereby, 
and our friends and neighbors as 
well. 

May the Lord bless and sanctify 
to our good the things that we have 
heard this day and that we shall 
hear during this conference, that it 
may be a time of rejoicing. I don't 
know when I have ever come to a 
conference that I felt more de- 
lighted and happy than on this oc- 
casion ; and I leave my blessing, as 
I am sure you have the blessing of 
my brethren. The testimony of 
President Smith as given in our 
favor here today, I think is won- 
derfully fine, and I want to bear 
the same kind of testimony for our 
brethren that are "treading the 
winepress" in their various stakes 
and wards and missions, and the 
sisters who are laboring in their 
various positions, seconding our 
efforts and labors for the salvation 
of the people. May the Lord bless 
us and bless all Israel, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

Presidents Joseph F. Smith, 
Anthon H. Lund, 
Charles W . Penrose, 
First Presidency of the Church of 

Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Dear Brethren : The Church 
Auditing Committee begs leave to 
report that we have critically ex- 
amined the books and accounts for 
1915 of the Trustee-in-Trust and of 
the Presiding Bishopric, as well as 
the reports made by the various 
Stakes, Wards, Temples, general 
auxiliary organizations and other 
institutions in' which the Church is 
interested. All of the accounts of 
receipts and disbursements of the 
Church funds are set out in full de- 
tail, and have been accurately kept 
and recorded. 



Your committee is especially 
pleased to comment again on the 
diligence and careful bookkeeping- 
exhibited in all accounts that have 
been inspected. Our audit dis- 
closes not only faithful and accu- 
rate work, but also skill and devo- 
tion in using the funds contributed 
by the Saints for the best interests 
of the people. It is pleasing to 
make special mention of the liberal 
appropriations that have been made 
for the support of the poor, both at 
home and abroad, for the education 
of the children of the Saints, for 
the erection, enlargement and im- 
provement of meeting houses in the 
Stakes and Wards of Zion, and in 
the Missions abroad. 

May the blessings of God con- 
tinue to abide with you in discharg- 
ing the great responsibilities con- 
nected with the work of the Lord, 
Respectfully submitted. 

Your Brethren in the Gospel, 
W. W. Riter, 
Henry H. Rolapp, 
John C. Cutler, 
Joseph S. Wells, 
Heber Scowcroft, 
Church Auditing Committee. 

On motion, the foregoing was ac- 
cepted, and approved, by unanimous 
vote of the congregation. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "We thank Thee, O God, 
for a Prophet." 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder John Wells. 

Conference adjourned until Fri- 
day, April 7th, at 10 a. m. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Friday, April 
7th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "O ye mountains high, 
where the clear blue sky." Elder 
Thomas D. Rees, Jr., offered the 
opening prayer. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel, our 
only delight." 

ELDER JOSEPH C. BENTLY. 

(President Juarez Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
very grateful this morning for the 
privilege that I have of attending 
this conference, and listening to the 
instructions that come to us from 
our Heavenly Father, through His 
servants who preside over us. I am 
thankful for the privilege of asso- 
ciating with my brethren and sis- 
ters, and enjoying the Spirit of the 
Lord which accompanies us upon 
our gathering together in our gen- 
eral conferences. I am sure it is a 
great strength to all of us to have 
this privilege of associating to- 
o-ether, and being encouraged of the 
Lord in this great latter-day work, 
in which we are all engaged. Our 
only desire is to serve the Lord and 
to accomplish His purposes ; and 
while we desire to do or accomplish 
the purposes of our Heavenly 
Father, we ne'ed strength from time 
to time, and a renewal of the Spirit 
of the Lord in order to enable us to 
continue the struggle, and the effort 
that is necessary. 

I have anticipated for some time 
the pleasure of attending this con- 
ference, but a few weeks ago I con- 



cluded that I would not be enabled 
to come here, because of the unset- 
tled condition in our part of the 
Mexican country. Our condition 
for the last two weeks has been un- 
usually trying. I suppose all of you 
are aware that the Latter-day Saints 
in Mexico are located in the heart 
of the revolutionary section of that 
country, where revolutions are man- 
ufactured. Our condition for a 
number of years has not been as 
satisfactory as we should like to 
have had it, especially since the 
recognition of General Carranza by 
this government. It has produced 
an unusual disturbing and unsettled 
condition. Our people who reside 
in Mexico have endeavored to main- 
tain a neutral position, so far as 
we are concerned. In the beginning 
of this trouble in Mexico, we were 
counseled by the brethren who pre- 
side over us, that our position 
should be absolutely neutral; that 
we should not engage in the conflict 
that was going on in that country. 
We have endeavored to maintain 
this position and to maintain friend- 
ly relationship with all the different 
contending parties that come into 
our community. While we have 
been regarded as foreigners, as 
American citizens or people belong- 
ing to the United States, yet there 
has always been more or less dis- 
tinction in the minds of the people 
of Mexico concerning the Latter- 
dav Saints and other Americans 
who come there for the purpose of 
gaining a livelihood, engaging in 
minincr and other industries that do 
not identify them especially with 
the country. 

A fter the recognition of General 
Carranza, General Villa returned, 
and in our locality he kept about

twelve thousand of his followers for 
a period of six weeks, most of them 
located among our people in Co- 
lonia Dublan. They were surprised 
to find so many American people 
there, although there really were 
but a few, and they were surprised 
to find so much food and substance. 
They were a hungry lot; they had 
been whipped and chased over the 
hills, and when they reached our 
part of the country they were a 
famished crowd of people; it did 
their hearts good to see somebody 
that could give them something to 
eat. They paid for what they got 
in their own kind of money, but of 
course that was of no value to us, 
nor to anyone else for that matter, 
because it had so decreased in value 
that it was not worth any more than 
the counterfeit, nevertheless we sold 
them our produce. We kept that 
body of men, women, and children 
in our locality for about six weeks, 
and fed them corn and other prod- 
ucts of the colony. After they had 
gone we reaped the greatest crops 
that we have ever harvested in 
Mexico. This surprised us, and we 
can not understand it yet. After 
feeding that great army for that 
length of time, we had the greatest 
harvest we have ever reaped, in pro- 
portion to the number of people and 
acreage, since we have been located 
in Mexico. Our granaries were 
full, and we had plenty to eat and 
to wear. 

After being defeated in Sonora, 
a portion of that army returned 
again to us. They were not in quite 
as friendly a mood on their return 
as they were when they went away, 
but still we managed to get along 
with them. We treated them kind- 
ly ; we endeavored to impress upoh 
their minds that we were there for 
the good of the Mexican people. 



They destroyed some of our prop- 
erty, but were astonished at being 
treated kindly after they arrived, 
and did comparatively little dam- 
age, and they passed us by again. 
A few weeks ago, after the Amer- 
icans were killed down at the min- 
ing camp, General Villa and his 
company of soldiers passed near our 
colony again, on his way to Colum- 
bus. Friendly Mexicans brought 
word that he said he was going to 
destroy Colony Juarez, and kill all 
the "Mormons ;" but he passed us 
by, and afterward said it entirely 
slipped his mind, and he had gone 
so far past that he guessed he would 
not go back. We were very thank- 
ful that he did not, and greatly ap- 
preciated the fact that he had passed 
by without coming to see us. 

After the terrible attack on Co- 
lumbus, and the destruction of 
property and lives of Americans, 
and many of their own people who 
came in contact with them, it caused 
great concern to those of us in the 
colonies, especially the natives and 
Carranza's Mexican soldiers. They 
were very much concerned because 
his return brought him again in the 
direction of the colonies. It is a 
good, rich, fertile country, and is a 
good place in which to recruit. It 
has been a favorite place for the 
revolutionists, ever since the begin- 
nining of this trouble. They have 
been able to get more good horses, 
and good provisions, in that locality 
than in any other part of Mexico 
where they have been ; consequent- 
ly, on Villa's return a few weeks 
ago, after the attack on Columbus, 
there was considerable anxiety. I 
want to say this for the Carranza 
troops at Colonia Dublan, they are 
not well equipped, and they are not 
disciplined soldiers, but they had an 
interest in our people. They did

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not have a sufficient number to pro- 
vide any defense for us, but they 
were careful to keep us posted. No 
doubt we received a great many re- 
ports that were not true, but they 
sent us all the information they re- 
ceived, and there was not any of it 
very comforting. The indications 
were that Villa, with his straggling 
army and the wounded, were com- 
ing back again to the colonies. We 
were instructed, by the general in 
charge of the Carranza troops, to 
move our families into their gar- 
rison, and they would take care of 
us : but, bless your heart, they 
could not take care of themselves, 
let alone us. They could not have 
provided for us and our families ; 
and so we expressed to them our 
gratitude for their kind invitation, 
and said that if we should get 
frightened, and want to leave our 
homes, we would come. But, we 
called our brethren and sisters to- 
gether and appointed a general fast 
day. We asked all our brethren 
and sisters to fast, and to pray unto 
the Lord that we might get an im- 
pression concerning what we 
should do. We were entirely help- 
less, so far as worldly defense was 
concerned ; guns were very scarce 
in the colony. I was asked this 
morning ahout how many people 
we had in Colonia Juarez. We had 
about twenty-five men, and about 
two hundred fifty women and chil- 
dren. The same questioner wanted 
to know if we were well armed, and 
I said no, we did not have any 
arms ; and were thankful to the 
Lord we did not. We met on the 
fast day. and while the reports that 
came to us were not very comfort- 
ing, and we realized that our breth- 
ren and sisters in this country were 
very much exercised as to our 
safetv and welfare, and as to the 



wisdom of our remaining in Mex- 
ico, yet the unanimous expression 
of our brethren and sisters in that 
fast meeting was that the Spirit of 
the Lord prompted we should re- 
main at home, and serve the Lord 
and keep His commandments, and 
put our trust in Him, and He would 
take care of us whatever the con- 
ditions were. We felt that, if Gen- 
eral Villa and his army should come 
to us, the Lord could soften his 
heart and that he would pass by 
and leave us with a better feeding 
of friendship than had existed be- 
fore. At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the brethren and sisters 
returned to their homes, calm and 
happy, and the night that General 
Villa passed those colonies the peo- 
ple slept in peace. There was no 
one on guard, the Carranza soldiers 
had withdrawn, every man was put 
into the pits to defend themselves 
against the approach of General 
Villa. You may not understand, 
my brethren and sisters, how that 
Villa's name strikes terror to the 
hearts of those people. It is not 
only Americans that he does not 
like, when he takes it into his head 
to destroy life he seems to have no 
regard to race or color. The Mex- 
icans were very much exercised 
when they heard that he was only 
three miles away from our colony, 
and that it would only be a matter 
of an hour's time till he could enter 
it. There was not a person in Colo- 
nia Dublan except Latter-day 
Saints, but we retired to our homes, 
slept peacefully, and during the 
night Villa and his guards came 
into Colony Dublan, within a half 
a mile of our homes, looked over 
the town and passed on ; he never 
even disturbed us. 

I want to say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, the people of those

colonies feel that the Lord has pre- 
served us. He has heard and an- 
swered our prayers. President 
Joseph F. Smith, in the beginning 
of our return to the colonies, told 
us that the key to our safety was 
the spirit of love, the spirit of kind- 
ness, the Spirit of the Lord, and the 
exercise of patience towards the 
people by whom we were surround- 
ed. If we would manifest this 
Spirit, and put our trust in the 
Lord, He would take care of us. It 
has been a wonderful testimony to 
the Latter-day Saints and especially 
to our children, that when we serve 
the Lord and keep His command- 
ments, and put our trust in Him, 
He will take care of us. We had 
no other defense, there was no 
other possible show for us, and we 
know that the Lord heard and an- 
swered the prayers of the Latter- 
day Saints concerning His people 
in that dangerous position in Mex- 
ico. 

I feel very grateful for the priv- 
ilege I have had of living in the 
land of Mexico. I love that peo- 
ple, notwithstanding their degrada- 
tion. When I realize that they have 
lived under a curse for many hun- 
dreds of years, it is a marvel to me 
that there is as much good in Mex- 
ico and among her people as there 
is today. They are a child-like peo- 
ple; and if the spirit of kindness, 
of patience, and of love can be ex- 
ercised by the American people, to- 
ward them, that will do more to- 
wards establishing peace in that 
country than all of the guns and 
ammunition that can be manufac- 
tured. It seems to me — it has al- 
ways seemed to me — that the mis- 
sion of the Latter-day Saints in 
Mexico, in fact, the mission of 
the Latter-day Saints in all the 



world, is a mission of peace. We 
should live peacefully, speak 
peacefully, and breathe the spirit 
of peace among all mankind. We 
are living in a time when the spirit 
of war is being poured out upon all 
nations, and it seems to me that the 
great mission of the Latter-day 
Saints is to endeavor to establish 
peace. I know that by dealing with 
the Mexican people in the spirit of 
love and kindness, and showing to 
them true friendliness, you can win 
their hearts ; they are a very ap- 
proachable people. 

The Lord has a work to do in 
that country. It is not a battle of 
men ; it is not a struggle between 
men especially, it is a struggle be- 
tween the power of our Heavenly 
Father and the powers of darkness 
that have spread over that coun- 
try. Darkness has been over the 
minds of the people, and they are 
in a degraded and distressing condi- 
tion. My belief has been that when- 
ever the time shall come that the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ shall be 
planted in that land it will be by 
the faith of men and women who 
are willing to put their trust in the 
Lord, men and women who can 
exhibit a spirit of kindness, a spirit 
of love and charity, even to those 
who would do them evil. The in- 
structions of our Lord and Savior 
is the key-note to the success of the 
Latter-day Saints, not only in Mex- 
ico, but in every other part of the 
country where we shall go, that is 
to "do good to them that hate you, 
and pray for them which despite - 
fully use you," love our enemies and 
treat all mankind kindly. It is a 
mighty hard person who would con- 
tinually fight against the spirit of 
kindnesss. 

While we have not been, perhaps, 



3<>

as careful as we should have been, 
while we have not always lived as 
near to the Lord as we might have 
clone, yet I believe we stand among 
the Mexican people today nearer to 
their hearts than we have even been 
before. If they were to have their 
choice they would like to have us 
continue to remain in their midst. 
We have gained their friendship 
and their respect. There has not 
been a single party, (unless Gen- 
eral Felix Diaz has succeeded in 
starting a new revolution), that has 
not been into our colonies, and 
every one of them has left us feel- 
ing better than when they came. To 
be sure, they have robbed us, to 
some extent, they have taken 
horses, and saddles, and merchan- 
dise, but thank the Lord they have 
not taken our lives. We have been 
preserved; the Lord has manifested 
His Spirit, and the men who have 
robbed us, who have taken our 
property, and destroyed much of 
that which the Lord has blessed us 
with, have acknowledge that they 
would rather have their families 
among the Latter-day Saints than 
any other place in Mexico. Not- 
withstanding they have robbed and 
persecuted us, they realize that 
their families are safe among the 
Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, I re- 
joice in the work of the Lord. Our 
living in Mexico is not so much the 
acquiring and maintaining homes 
and property, but it has always 
seemed to me that it was the will of 
the Lord. I desire to say that I 
know there is a mighty work to do 
among that people. If we can only 
maintain the spirit of kindness, of 
humanity, of charity, and of pa- 
tience, the time will come when we 
will see the Gospel of the Lord 



Jesus Christ take hold of that peo- 
ple, when they will be brought into 
the fold of Christ, and a great and 
mighty work accomplished. 

May the Lord bless us, and help 
us to establish peace upon the earth, 
not only in that country but in all 
the world, including our own coun- 
try, the United States. We need 
to live in accord with the spirit of 
peace, to assist in establishing it in 
all the world, that we may help our 
Father bring about the great plan 
of peace on earth, and prepare for 
the coming of our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ. May we live worthy, 
my brethren and sisters to take part 
in this great latter-day work, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

A poem entitled, "A Temple in 
Hawaii," written by Sister Ruth M. 
Fox, melody composed by Elder 
Orson Clark, was sung, as a quar- 
tette, by Ethelyn Walker, Hazel B. 
Neilson, James H. Neilson, and 
Almy C. Clayton. 



PREST. JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

After the announcement here, last 
conference, that we intended to 
build a temple upon one of the 
Hawaiian Islands, Sister Ruth May 
Fox was inspired to write a hymn 
which was sent over to the Islands, 
and one of our elders there, Brother 
Orson Clark, composed music to it, 
and on the recent visit of Bishop 
Nibley and myself, we found them 
singing this beautiful song. We 
brought a copy of the words and 
music home with us, and Brother 
Stephens has prepared it to be sung 
today. If you will indulge with me 
for a moment, I will read you the 
words : 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

"Sound forth your strains of gladness, 

ye islands of the sea, 
And lift your hearts in praises, O 

Saints of Hawaii; 
The Lord hath heard your pleadings, 

your long sought day is here 
When to the great Jehovah a temple 

you shall rear. 

chorus : 

"A temple, a temple, in Hawaii! 
Foreshadowing the glories and splen- 
dors yet to be. 

"The spirit of Elijah shall permeate its 

halls, 
A choice beloved remnant, within its 

sacred walls 
Receive the promised blessings their 

father Lehi saw 
The Lord would shower upon them 

when they obey His law. 

"Samuel, the Lamanite, forecast this 

blessed day; 
Nephi and Moroni and the faithful 

passed away 
Who lived, believed, and perished on 

Joseph's glorious land 
Unite with you in praises for God's all 

guiding hand." 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Observance of Word of Wisdom 
would vastly increase community 
wealth — Man's efficiency destroyed 
by intoxicating liquors — Each dollar 
retained in circulation, in Utah, in- 
creases citizens' average wealth — 
Deadly character of the cigarette — 
The cigarette smoker always a fail- 
ure. 

I rejoice, beyond the ability with 
which God has given me the power 
to express my feelings, in having a 
testimony of the divinity of the 
work in which we are engaged. I 
rejoice in being able to bear witness 
to you here today that the Lord has 
blessed me with a knowledge that 
He lives, that He hears, and that 
He answers our prayers. I rejoice 
in knowing that Jesus is the Re- 
deemer of the world, our elder 



brother, and that His name and His 
name alone, is the only one under 
heaven whereby we can gain salva- 
tion and come back and dwell with 
our Heavenly Father and our Sav- 
ior, and our loved ones who have 
gone before. I rejoice in the knowl- 
edge that Joseph Smith was the 
prophet of the true and the living 
God, and the revelations that have 
come to us from him, which are 
recorded in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, are in very deed the com- 
mandments of the Lord and of His 
Son our Redeemer, and that it is 
our duty and an obligation resting 
upon us to obey those command- 
ments. Every word that I have 
heard, the testimonies and the ex- 
pounding of the doctrines of Christ, 
since this conference has opened, 
have found an echo in my heart 
and I have thanked God for the 
testimonies which have been borne 
to us, thus far in this conference. 

I acknowledge the hand of God 
in the preservation of our people in 
Mexico. It is a miracle, and there 
should be a feeling of gratitude in 
our hearts to our Heavenly Father 
for the preservation of those of our 
brethren and sisters who have been 
located in that land. T confess that 
their faith has been superior to 
mine. I am afraid that if I had 
been located in Mexico, I would 
have left that country long ago. 

I was particularly impressed yes- 
terday with the remarks made here 
by the President of the Council to 
which I have the honor to belong, 
and I desire during the time that I 
occupy, if the Lord will only bless 
me with His Spirit, to make some 
remarks along the same line upon 
which President Lyman spoke yes- 
terday. 

I remember years ago, one of the 
most sarcastic and splendid letters 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that I ever read, being handed to 
me by Brother Junius F. Wells, 
writen by his father while presiding 
over the European mission, and it 
showed up the hypocrisy of those 
at that time who were pretending 
to stand for the purity of the Amer- 
ican home. Brother Junius pub- 
lished the letter in the Contributor, 
not signing his father's name to it 
but signing "Forty-niner," and 
when the Contributor arrived in 
Liverpool, Brother Wells wrote 
back and wanted to know who that 
old man was that signed himself 
"Forty-niner." He said, "Darn his 
buttons, he is stealing my thunder." 
I had it in my heart yesterday, 
as I sat upon this stand, to talk upon 
the temporal salvation of this peo- 
ple, which is sure to come if we 
only obey the commandments of 
the Lord which He has given for 
our temporal salvation ; and lo and 
behold, Brother Lyman stole nearly 
all of my thunder. He quoted the 
identical part of the Word of Wis- 
dom that I had intended to quote, 
but, like the frequent singing of •our 
songs — "O, ye mountains high," 
and "We thank thee, O God, for 
a prophet," we can never repeat too 
often the commandments of the 
Lord to this people, and urge upon 
the Saints to live up to them. I 
have said from this stand time and 
time again, I believe that if we as 
a people had only obeyed the Word 
of Wisdom, temporal salvation 
would have come to us, and we 
would have become the wealthiest 
state west of the Mississippi River ; 
that while we were driven from 
A T auvoo and came here to what was 
then considered a barren and worth- 
less country; that, had we obeyed 
this one simple law of God, the 
wealth of this community would 
have been so great that no other 



section of the country between here 
and Illinois would have had any- 
where near the wealth which we 
would have possessed. 

There is being consumed today in 
the United States twenty-one dol- 
lars per capita by the users of in- 
toxicating liquors. I am sure the 
good people of Utah are not con- 
suming their pro rata of this 
amount. If we were as progressive 
and as prosperous as the average of 
the United States, according to the 
ideas of some people who call them- 
selves financiers we would be spend- 
ing the same as others and thus be 
worse than wasting today, because 
we have about four hundred thou- 
sand people, eight million dollars 
a year, and all we would have to 
show for this prosperity ( ?) would 
be empty bottles and empty barrels. 

I believe in home manufacture. 
I believe in wearing home-made 
clothes. I believe in patronizing 
our different factories which are 
built here. And from my early 
childhood, in the days when I lis- 
tened to President Brigham Young 
and others, it was burned into my 
very vitals that financial success 
would come to this community by 
building up our industries. But how 
under the heavens any man with the 
ordinary intelligence with which 
God has endowed him believes and 
can believe that empty barrels and 
empty bottles will bring wealth to 
this community, when the contents 
have first destroyed the manhood 
and the intellectuality and the effi- 
ciency of the people who have 
emptied the bottles and barrels, is 
one of the untold mysteries to me. 
Success in life comes with the effi- 
ciency of the individual ; and what 
applies to the individual applies to 
the city, applies to the county, ap- 
plies to the state. Anything under

the heavens that destroys the indi- 
vidual efficiency of a man destroys 
the individual efficiency of all the 
community in proportion as they 
are destroyed as individuals. 

There is in the last Collier's 
Weekly an- article entitled, "The 
ruin prohibition brought to Kan- 
sas," and I would like to read just 
a little of the ruin that has come to 
Kansas from prohibition. 

"While the people of Kansas talk 
very little about this, being a reticent 
folk, it is generally realized that pro- 
hibition has killed in this state about 
every industry except the raising of 
wheat and corn and alfalfa and fruit 
and live stock; potatoes and peas and 
cabbages and 'garden sass'; chickens 
and ducks and geese and horses and 
mules. Almost immediately prohibi- 
tion ruined our most prominent gam- 
blers, blighted our beer gardens, and 
killed the bartenders' union. 

"Prohibition has left very little of 
Kansas except the growing crops in 
her field, the stock in her stock pens, 
the dreary round of work, work, work 
in her factories and stores and other 
industries. It has left us little to do 
in hours of leisure except just to fall 
in love, get married, send our children 
to school, go abroad occasionally, join 
the church when we feel like it, run 
into each other with expensive auto- 
mobiles, and store our money away in 
dusty bank vaults instead of giving it 
to cheerful gentlemen with white 
aprons who used to stand in front of 
cut-glass bars and say occasionally, 
(And I might say mighty occasion- 
ally) : 'This one is on the house.' 

"Where once the thriving business 
of the saloon sent the clamorous odor 
of its prosperity out upon the side- 
walk and clear across the street, (gen- 
erally the product was kicked out upon 
the street, and not able to get a quar- 
ter way across), we find nothing but 
shoe stores, clothing stores, dry-goods 
stores, meat markets, grocery stores, 
and other sordid activities of an un- 
happy people.* * * * * 

"There hasn't even been a case of 
delirium tremens in the state since 
1896, and at the time that was thought 
by inexperienced surgeons to be due 



to the free-silver campaign. * * * 
"Then, too, we have driven out of 
Kansas a class that was very useful 
to us, that relieved us entirely of the 
responsibility of local government. In 
the day before the state went dry no 
one ever worried about who was to be 
alderman or chief of police or mayor. 
We knew that the saloon men would 
look after that — it was part of their 
business. They wielded the balance 
of power and the political bickerings 
which sometimes now enter into the 
selection of our local officers in Kan- 
sas were wholly unnecessary in that 
old day. The saloon men got together 
and made up the ticket and got it 
elected. All we had to do was to pav 
the bills. 

"Now heaven alone knows when a 
campaign opens who is going to be 
elected, and wdien he is elected he 
spends so much of his time worrying 
about the recall provisions of the 
charter that it spoils much of the 
oleasure and all of the profit which 
his old-time predecessors used to get 
out of the job. 

"With the example of Kansas being 
constantly pointed out by the liquor 
men, why will state after state rise up 
and kick these benefactors in the face 
in the ungrateful way they are now 
doing?" 

Brother Edward H. Anderson has 
written to Collier's for permission 
to publish the whole article in the 
Era, so I shall not read any more 
of it. 

In the American Patriot we find 
an article on the worms that are de- 
stroying the harvest in the United 
States. It goes on to tell of the ter- 
rible ravages, but science has 
brought remedies whereby these can 
be obliterated and all this trouble 
of the worms has no effect. Tt tells 
that in one of the old readers there 
was an article that gave an account 
of a deadly worm that preyed upon 
men, which was found in every sec- 
tion of the country. The article in 
the old reader pointed out that this 
worm was one of the most destruc-

tive agencies to the life of man 
known in the history of the world, 
in a way that the young readers 
could understand, and gave a 
graphic picture of this strange 
worm, together with an unmistak- 
able account of its fearful effects 
upon humanity. "By this means 
many young people learned of the 
most venomous thing in existence, 
and learned by this plain warning 
to avoid it. Many names had been 
given it, but, in this account, the 
real name of the creature was given. 
Tt was called the zvorm of the Still." 
"The worm of the still," when 
men use it destroys them so that 
they are not capable of having tem- 
poral salvation, because it destroys 
their intellect, it destroys their 
physical as well as their mental 
power. It is estimated, by students 
of finance, that every dollar of cir- 
culating medium goes over and 
over in a community and does in a 
year from twenty-five to one hun- 
dred dollars' worth of work. In the 
United States there is seven hun- 
dred and fifty million dollars a year 
expended in tobacco alone, and two 
billion and one hundred million dol- 
lars expended on liquor. Nearly 
every dollar which we spend on 
liquor and tobacco is sent away 
from the state — and say that we 
only spend a quarter of what othei 
people do — it would amount to at 
least two millions and a half dollars 
a year, which is drained from our 
fair state — thus adding to our pros- 
perity according to the whisky 
men's arguments. Multiply these 
two millions and a half by twenty- 
five or one hundred and you will 
then see what a capacity the good 
people of Utah would have to sup- 
port our industries because of the 
immense amount of circulating me- 
dium which the people would pos- 



sess. Truly our capacity because of 
the possession of this vast sum 
added to our circulating medium an- 
nually would indeed be marvelous. 
The Lord knew exactly what He 
was saying when He told us that if 
we would obey His law — the Word 
of Wisdom — it would bring us tem- 
poral salvation. That is exactly 
what it will do for us from the day 
we obey it. It is not what a man 
makes that gives him strength and 
power financially in the community, 
but it is what he saves. This sure 
rule applies to all the people as well 
as the individual. If we had kept 
the money here which has been 
worse than wasted by sending it 
abroad for tobacco and liquor, we 
would have had power, as money is 
power, we would have secured tem- 
poral salvation. Men who have ac- 
quired the appetite will have to- 
bocco and liquor, even if they have 
to sacrifice the ordinary wants of 
their families to secure these things. 
I hold in my hand a little pam- 
phlet of which I have given away 
hundreds of copies. It is entitled, 
"The case against the little white 
slaver." It is a book against the 
cigarette published in pamphlet 
form, by Henry Ford, the manu- 
facturer of the Ford automobile. 
Some years ago we had on our Mu- 
tual Improvement course of reading 
a book entitled, "The strength of 
being clean," by David Starr Jor- 
dan ; and President Joseph F. Smith 
remarked that it was one of the 
finest vindications, by a great edu- 
cator, of the inspiration of God to 
Joseph Smith in giving us the Word 
of Wisdom, that had ever been pub- 
lished by a non-"Mormon." David 
Starr Jordan is not only a national 
but an international character. I 
have written in the front of Mr. 
Ford's pamphlet a remark of Mr. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



41 



Jordan's: "The boy who smokes 
cigarettes need not be anxious about 
his future. He has none." I would 
like that to "soak in." Just think it 
over : "The boy who smokes cigar- 
ettes need not be anxious about his 
future. He has none." Recently 
the Bureau of Information received 
a letter making some inquiry about 
certain doctrines of the Church. I 
have here one or two quotations 
from what was printed on the back 
of the letter and these I have also 
written in this pamphlet of Mr. 
Ford's. 

"A prominent banker - 'I have never 
yet employed a young man who said 
he used tobacco or liquor.' " 

Fathers and mothers, do you 
want bankers to employ your boys ? 
Remember the day is coming when 
they will not do it if they use to- 
bacco or liquor. 

"Fidelity Insurance Company — 'We 
will not bond a man who uses cigar- 
ettes, for such men are not safe phys- 
ically nor morally.' " 

Think of it ! Cigarette users can't 
even pay money enough to get this 
company to insure their honesty. 

"Charles W. Murphy— 'All the 'Cub' 
baseball players must leave liquor 
alone at all times, must abstain from 
the use of cigarettes.' " 

No wonder they are one of the 
greatest clubs in the world. 

"Conclusion — 'My son, as long as 
thou hast in thy skull the sense ot a 
jay-bird, break away from the cigar- 
ette, for lo, it causeth thy breath to 
stink like a glue factory; it rendereth 
thy mind less intelligent than that of 
a cigar store dummy, yea thou art a 
cipher with the rim knocked off.' — Bob 
Rurdette." 

Thomas A. Edison — one of the 



greatest minds the world has ever 
produced — writes to Mr. Ford : 

"The injurious agent in cigarettes 
comes principally from the burning 
paper wrapper. The substance there- 
by formed is called 'acrolein.' It has 
a violent action on the nerve centers, 
producing degeneration of the cells 
of the brain, which is quite rapid 
among boys. Unlike most narcotics 
this degeneration is permanent and 
uncontrollable. I employ no person 
who smokes cigarettes." 

Think of it ! Degeneration of the 
brains of our children comes from 
using cigarettes, and this degenera- 
tion becomes permanent and uncon- 
trollable and yet people go on say- 
ing that we can drink and smoke 
and chew and we injure nobody but 
ourselves. It is false ! If we de- 
generate our brain power we injure 
our posterity after us. 

John Wannamaker, Henry Ford, 
Marshall Field & Company, the 
Cadillac Motor Company, some of 
the great railroads with hundreds 
of millions of capital invested, re- 
fuse to employ cigarette smokers. 

"A new arithmetic. 'I am not much 
of a mathematician,' said the cigarette, 
'but I can add nervous troubles to a 
boy, I can subtract from his physical 
energy, I can multiply his aches and 
pains, I can divide his mental powers, 
I can take interest from his work and 
discount his chances for success.' " 

I would like the last part of the 
sentence to soak in — "and discount 
his chances for success." 

The head of the tobacco trust 
writes a long letter to Mr. Ford and 
demands that he apologize for his 
attack on the cigarette, claiming it 
is not injurious, and tells of the 
wonderful increase in the use of 
cigarettes and says that this is an 
argument in favor of it. He says 
that in 1900 there were two billion, 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



six hundred million cigarettes used. 
In 1913 there were fifteen billion, 
eight hundred million cigarettes 
used — (nails in the coffins of those 
that used them and a partial de- 
struction of their intellectuality) — 
an increase of seven hundred per 
cent. Mr. Henry Ford's secretary 
answers and calls this tobacco man's 
attention to the fact that one of the 
magistrates in New York City an- 
nounces that "ninety-nine per cent 
of all the boys between the ages of 
ten and seventeen who come before 
him charged with crime have their 
fingers disfigured with cigarette 
stains." Dr.T.D. Crothers says that, 
"In young persons who begin on 
cigarettes there are always pro- 
nounced symptoms of poisoning, 
such as pallor and dullness of activ- 
ity," and the brain fails to act. We 
find that Dr. Fred J. Pack of our 
own University of Utah made an 
investigation which was published 
in one of the eastern magazines. 
The Temperance Journal. 

"Two hundred ten men held a con- 
test for positions on the athletic team. 
Of the non-smokers, sixty-five per 
cent were successful; of the smokers 
only thirty-three per cent were suc- 
cessful. This was not only true in the 
six institutions which furnished the 
data about the try-outs when taken as 
a total, but in each of the six the non- 
smokers far outstripped the smokers. 
In one institution not a single smoker 
obtained a place on the team." 

I called up Doctor Pack this 
morning and got some additional 
information. Dr. Pack is the head 
of the Geological Department in the 
University of Utah, and during the 
summer vacations he goes out with 
the boys and they climb mountains 
and they take hikes and they have 
long trials of endurance. They 
climb many a mountain which takes 
more than one day to get to the 



summit ; and Dr. Pack notifies the 
boys, puts them on their mettle, be- 
fore they start announcing that 
''No cigarette smokers will arrive at 
the top of the mountain with the 
boys that do not smoke ;" and his 
promise of failure for the smokers 
has always been fulfilled. You can 
pick the smokers out down the hill 
by the number of the nails, figura- 
tively speaking, that they have been 
putting in their coffins by using 
cigarettes. 

Speaking of the failure of men 
reminds me of an article that I bor- 
rowed this morning from Brother 
Joseph W. McMurrin. I see my 
time is running on and I must not 
attempt to read it. (President 
Smith: "Go on.") This article, 
published in August, 1914, in The 
Literary Digest, tells that in fifty 
long years no single solitary boy 
that used tobacco has graduated at 
the head of his class in Harvard 
University. How 1 do thank the 
Lord that all over the world the doc- 
trines of the Lord Jesus Christ 
which have come to us through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith are being 
vindicated. Fifty long years and 
no smoker at the head of his class 
in Harvard ! And yet there were 
five smokers out of every six stu- 
dents, so we are entitled to multiply 
the fifty years by five and announce 
that in two hundred and fifty years, 
man to man, the smoker has failed. 
What a wonderful record ! what a 
marvelous vindication of the inspi- 
ration of Almighty God to that 
young man, Joseph Smith. It is not 
only in the Word of Wisdom, but it 
is in every doctrine that God has 
revealed to us that this vindication 
is coming, day after day and year 
after year. Dr. Kress says that the 
cigarette injures young men mor- 
ally. Mike Donovan, the head of 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

the great New York Athletic Club, 

says : 

"Any boy who smokes can never 
hope to succeed in any line of en- 
deavor, as smoking weakens the heart 
and lungs and ruins the stomach and 
affects the entire nervous system. If 
a boy or young man expects to amount 
to anything in athletics, he must let 
smoking and all kinds of liquor alone. 
They are rank poison to his athleti'- 
ambitions." 

Mrs. Paterson, president of the 
Georgia Woman's Christian Tem- 
perance Union, says : 

"Several years ago I stepped into a 
grocery store and asked to buy a pack- 
age of cigarette papers, such as were 
given away at that time with Durham 
smoking tobacco. I took two small 
bottles, each holding about three ta- 
blespoonfuls of water. In one I placed 
fifteen of these cigarette papers, and 
in the other an equal thickness o' 
leaves of tissue paper from between 
visiting cards, for the tissue papers 
were much thinner and it took a larger 
number of leaves. 

"I found that a few drops of the 
water from the bottle containing the 
cigarette paper would kill a mouse, 
quicker than you could say 'Jack Rob 
in son,' and a teaspoonful of the water 
from the other papers seemed to cause 
a mouse to suffer no inconvenience. 

"I have killed dozens of mice with 
this water and there are others who 
have tried the experiment with the 
same success. Will Mr. Hill please 
tell me what made the difference in 
the same water, in the same kind of 
bottles, except the papers that were 
placed in the bottle?" (Mr. Hill is 
the president of the tobacco company 
who wrote Mr. Ford for an apology 
because he claimed cigarettes were 
not injurious.) 

Here is the one thing above all 
others in Mr. Ford's pamphlet which 
has impressed me : 

"Several of my young acquaint- 
ances are in their graves who gave 
promise of making happy and use- 
ful citizens," declares Luther Bur- 



bank, the wizard of the plant and 
vegetable kingdom whose experi- 
ments have caused the civilized 
world to wonder, and whose experi- 
ments have benefited the civilized 
world by millions upon millions, in 
increase of prosperity, by the in- 
crease in the various things that he 
has done in improvement in flowers 
and in seeds and in fruits and in the 
redemption of the cactus in Ari- 
zona, taking the thorns out; he is 
in very deed the wizard of the agri- 
cultural world and one of the bene- 
factors of mankind. He says : 
"And there is no question whatever 
that cigarettes alone were the cause 
of their destruction. No boy living 
would commence the use of cigar- 
ettes if he knew what a useless, 
soulless, worthless thing they would 
make of him." 

May the Lord help us in keeping 
our sons from becoming "useless, 
soulless, worthless things," is my 
prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

The Prophet Joseph Smith the most 
striking figure of the 19th century — 
His first glorious vision — Author- 
ized to re-establish the Church of 
Jesus Christ — Priesthood restored 
— Established saving ordinances in 
behalf of the dead — Translated the 
Book of Mormon — Many glorious 
revelations received, and published, 
by him — Head of the greatest, the 
last, dispensation. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire 
an interest in your faith and pray- 
ers this morning while I stand be- 
fore you for a few moments, that 
I may be led, like others who have 
spoken, to say something that 
shall be instructive and faith-pro- 
moting. 

Joseph Smith, the prophet, was 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



by far the most striking figure of 
the nineteenth century. 1 realize 
that this is a very bold declaration 
and while many will readily con- 
cede to it, others will regard it as 
presumptuous, but let me say to 
you, brethren and sisters and 
friends, that there is ample evi- 
dence to sustain it. The following 
are a few things that make Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, conspicuous 
among men : 

In the first place, he was favored 
with a personal visit of God the 
Father, and of Jesus Christ, His 
Son. He testified that he knew they 
lived, because he had seen their 
faces and heard their voices, and 
that they were in the form and like- 
ness of a man. Thus was restored 
to the earth again the knowledge of 
God, at a time when many supposed 
Him to be a being without body, 
parts or passions. This first glor- 
ious vision of the prophet swept 
darkness and doubt, ignorance and 
unbelief from the minds of men, at 
least hundreds and thousands, and 
a great flood of light burst in upon 
them and filled their souls. 

Joseph Smith, the prophet, under 
divine guidance, founded the 
Church of Jesus Christ, the only 
Church under the heavens in this 
age of the world known and called 
by that name. 

In connection with the founding 
of the Church, Joseph Smith re- 
ceived and transmitted to others the 
holy Priesthood, representing di- 
vine authority, by which the Gos- 
pel is preached and the ordinances 
thereof administered for the salva- 
tion of souls, or, in other words, by 
which men are baptized by immer- 
sion for the remission of their sins 
and have hands laid upon them for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost. Jesus 
said : "Except a man is born of the 



water and of the spirit, he cannot 
enter into the kingdom of heaven." 
The gift of the Holy Ghost is the 
key that unlocks the deep and hid- 
den mysteries of God. 

The Church founded by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith not only 
provided a plan of salvation for 
the living but also for the dead, be- 
ing broad enough in its scope to 
reach every child of God, whether 
in this world or the world to come. 
The latter-day Church, like the 
former day Church- is built upon the 
foundations of apostles and proph- 
ets, evangelists, high priests, sev- 
enties, elders, bishops, priests, 
teachers and deacons, Jesus Christ 
being the chief corner-stone. 

By the power of God, Joseph 
Smith translated into the English 
language the Book of Mormon, a 
record which is quite as sacred and 
precious as the Bible itself. He 
also gave to the Church the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, a book con- 
taining the revelations of God's 
will to His prophet and His peo- 
ple ; also that wonderful little rec- 
ord, the Pearl of Great Price. If 
all other books in the world were 
destroyed in an instant and these 
four hooks still remained — the Bi- 
ble, the Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants, and the 
Pearl of Great Price — they would 
constitute a library of priceless 
value, and would form a solid basis 
from which and by which to regen- 
erate the world. 

In the providences of the Lord, 
and by His word and power, Joseph 
Smith the prophet restored to the 
earth again the everlasting cove- 
nant, called the new and everlasting 
covenant, a covenant that binds 
the husband to the wife and the 
wife to the husband for time and 
all eternity, thus securing to them 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



45 



the power of eternal increase and 
the blessing of endless lives, and 
emphasizing, as no earthly cove- 
nant alone could do, the sanctity of 
the marriage bond, and by infer- 
ence or contrast, condemning the 
monstrous evil of divorce, when re- 
sorted to for trivial causes. 

Brethren and sisters, these are 
a few things which, I contend, 
raised Joseph Smith head an! 
shoulders above his fellows and at- 
tracted to him and to the Church 
converts from the nations of the 
earth, until the Church has pros- 
pered and grown to an extent be- 
yond our expectations. 

The Lord said to Joseph Smith : 
"And verily, verily, I say unto you, 
whatsoever you seal upon the earth 
shall be sealed in heaven, and what- 
soever you bind upon the earth, in 
my name and by my word, shall be 
eternally bound in the heavens, and 
whatsoever you loose upon the 
earth shall be loosed in heaven : 
and whosesoever sins vou remit on 
earth shall be remitted eternally in 
the heavens; and whosesoever sins 
you retain on earth, shall be re- 
tained in heaven." 

And again : "Verily I say, 
whomsoever you bless, I will bless : 
and whomsoever vou curse, I will 
curse, saith the Lord ; for I, the 
Lord, am thy God." 

Thus to Joseoh Smith, like Peter 
of old, was eiven the kevs of the 
kingdom of heaven and thus was 
Toseph Smith, unlike any prophet 
that ever lived, placed at the head 
of this creat last dispensation, the 
dispensation of dispensations, even 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, when all things will be re- 
stored to their proper place and 
order and all things gathered into 
one. 

Brethren and sisters, I again sol- 



emnly repeat — Joseph Smith, the 
mighty prophet of God, was the 
most striking figure of the nine- 
teenth century. The Lord bless 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Selfishness, a principal cause of war 
— Peace and salvation result of 
heeding teaching of God's servants 
— The Gospel should be taught in 
our households, and to our neigh- 
bors — God's message to the world 
against liquor and tobacco. 

My brethren and sisters, I trust 
that the few words I speak this 
morning may be indited by our 
Heavenly Father, for I have no de- 
sire to talk unless He inspires me. 

The good things we have listened 
to during this conference will be 
food for reflection for me for many 
weeks to come, and I am grateful 
to be here, where all is peace. The 
world is in confusion, men running 
hither and thither, not thirsting for 
the word of God, but seeking to 
gratify their selfish desires and 
destroy each other's lives ; and in 
Europe it has resulted in bringing 
about the greatest war this world 
has ever seen. In Mexico the spirit 
of murder, due to selfishness, has 
brought the people to a very un- 
fortunate condition, all of which 
would not exist if the warring peo- 
ple understood and lived the Gos- 
nel. Tt is gratifying to hear Presi- 
dent Bentley say that the charity 
and patience of the Latter-dav 
Saints south of the Rio Grande is 
bearing fruit among their Mexican 
neighbors. It is quite difficult, usu- 
ally, when we are smitten upon one 
cheek, to turn the other, but that is 
the Lord's wav to overcome the 
world. That is the commandment 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that has been given to the Latter- 
day Saints, it is the Gospel of the 
Redeemer. 

Since our first parents lived in 
the Garden of Eden, the Lord has 
revealed Himself to the human 
family from time to time, and 
sought to safeguard them from the 
sorrow that overtakes men on ac- 
count of selfishness. At intervals 
He has sent His prophets upon the 
earth, and they have repeated the 
kind advice of a loving Father to 
His children. The Old and New 
Testament scriptures are filled with 
counsel of the Lord, through His 
faithful servants in the old world. 
The Book of Mormon consists 
largely of the teachings of the 
prophets who, from age to age, 
taught the Gospel to the people of 
ancient America ; and now, in our 
day, the Lord has raised up a 
prophet, revealed Himself to him, 
inspired him and illumined his mind 
to teach what is necessary for this 
generation to know. The thing 
that appeals to me is that the peo- 
ple, from father Adam until the 
present time, who have had the 
greatest joy and happiness in life 
have been those who have followed 
the teachings of the prophets of 
the Lord ; those who have ignored 
them have paid the penalty in many 
cases by sorrow and destruction, 
missing the great blessings that our 
Father has placed within their 
reach. 

The Gospel that our Heavenlv 
Father desires all to understand is 
being promulgated in our day an! 
those who accept and live it will 
reap the happiness that follows. 
Fortunate are we who are assem- 
bled here today, that we understand 
and have accepted the truth an 1 
that we are striving to make it a 
part of our lives. We send mission- 



aries to the nations of the earth to 
proclaim the Gospel as revealed in 
this latter day. But that is not all 
our duty. Right at our doors, by 
die hundreds and thousands, are 
choice sons and daughters of our 
Heavenly Father. They live among 
us, we become friends, but we 
fail to teach them to the extent we 
i hould, concerning the Gospel that 
we know is the power of God unto 
salvation. The Presidency of the 
Church are doing all that lies in 
their power ; they devote their time 
during the day, and often into the 
late hours of the night, in the in- 
terest of the Church. The breth- 
ren who are associated with them 
o'ive liberally of their time, travel- 
ing and teaching the Latter-day 
Saints and carrying the Gospel to 
our Father's children. The presi- 
dents of stakes, high counselors, 
bishops .of wards, and their assist- 
ants, labor unceasingly to bless the 
people, and their reward is sure. 
I hit are we doing all we ought, so 
that when we stand before the bar 
of our Heavenly Father He will 
say we have done our full duty by 
our fellows, His children ? Are we 
setting our own houses in order? 
Are we teaching our children faith 
in God that when sickness invades 
our homes they will call for the 
elders of the Church and have faith 
that our Father, the Great Physi- 
cian, will heal them of their infirm- 
ities? Are we teaching those of 
our own household to repent of 
their shortcomings, teaching them 
rot to follow after the fashions of 
the world, that are calculated to 
destroy faith in God and detract 
from the glorious opportunities 
within our reach ? Are we teaching 
our children the necessity of bap- 
tism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins, calling their attention 



ELDER GEORGE . ILBERT SMITH. 



47 



to the fact that it is the law of the 
Lord, who required His Only Be- 
gotten Son to go down into the 
waters of baptism in order to ful- 
fill all righteousness? Are we 
teaching" our children the necessity 
of having the hands of the servants 
of God laid upon their heads, that 
they may receive the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, which we are told will 
bring things past to our remem- 
brance and teach us things that are 
yet to come? 

These are the first principles of 
the Gospel. They have been re- 
vealed anew in the day in which we 
live and fortunate, I say, are we 
that we have understood, them and 
that we are partakers of the bless- 
ings that follow their observance, 
for there is no other way. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints are the only ones 
who bear the authority of our 
Heavenly Father to administer in 
the ordinances of the Gospel. The 
world has need of us. Throughout 
the earth are men and women who, 
if they understood, as we under- 
stand, would receive the Gospel of 
our Lord. I feel sometimes that 
we do not sufficiently sense the im- 
portance of it, that we do not teach 
it with the earnestness -it demands. 
Speaking of faith, something that 
1 read recentlv comes to my mind. 
It is the teachings of the Prophet 
referred to by Moroni in the 7th 
chapter of the Book of Mormon, 
and reads as follows : 

"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, 
bath miracles ceased, because Christ 
hath ascended into heaven, and hath 
set down on the right hand of God. 
to claim of the Father His right of 
mercy which He hath upon the chil- 
dren of men? 

"For He hath answered the ends of 
the law, and He claimelh all those 
who have faith in Him, and they who 
have faith in Him, will cleave unto 



every good thing; wherefore He ad- 
vocateth the cause of the children of 
men, and He dwelleth eternally in the 

heavens." 

This is the point, all those who 
have faith in Him will cleave unto 
every good thing. If we can but 
implant a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel of our Lord and faith in His 
ministry, in the hearts of the ris- 
ing generation, we have gone a 
long way towards neutralizing the 
temptations and power of the ad- 
versary in this world. 

Quoting Moroni again, 

"Behold. I say unto you, it is by 
faith that miracles are wrought; and 
it is by faith that angels appear and 
minister unto men: wherefore, if 
these things have ceased, woe be unto 
the children of men, for it is because 
of unbelief, and all is vain." 

"For behold, the Spirit of Christ is 
given to- every man that he may know 
good from evil; wherefore I shew 
unto you the way to judge; for every- 
thing which inviteth to do good, and 
to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent 
forth by the power and gift of Christ; 
wherefore you may know with a per- 
fect knowledge it is of God. 

"But whatsoever thing persuadeth 
men to do evil, and believe not in 
Christ, and deny Him. and serve not 
God, then ye may know with a per- 
fect knowledge it is of the devil, for 
after this manner doth the devil work, 
for he persuadeth no man to do good, 
no, not one; neither doth his angels, 
neither do they who subject them- 
selves unto him. 

"And now, my brethren, see that 
ye know the light by which ye may 
judge, which light is the light of 
Christ, see that ye do not judge 
wrongfully; for with the same judg- 
ment, ye shall also be judged. 

"Wherefore T beseech of you, 
brethren, that ye should search dili- 
gently in the light of Christ, that ye 
may know good from evil; and if ye 
will lay hold upon every good thing, 
and condemn it not. ye certainly will 
he a child of Christ."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Our temporal welfare is of great 
importance. I endorse the teach- 
ings of this conference, to avoid 
the things that are so totally un- 
necessary and so terribly destructive 
of our lives. Our dear President 
in his opening address announced 
that we even now may be in the 
presence of our faithful leaders 
who have gone before. I am grate- 
ful for that suggestion and that 
testimony. What a happy influence 
it ought to have on our lives, if day 
by day, we could live so that our 
departed dear ones would desire 
to be near us. What a splendid 
thing it would be to live so that we 
could feel their presence and enjoy 
their companionship, even though 
they have passed to the other side. 
What joy will be ours if. day by 
day, we labor to radiate sunshine 
and inspire faith in the souls of 
man, that they may work righteous- 
ness, keep the commandments of 
our Father and look forward to a 
reunion with those who have gone 
before. 

I rejoice this day in a testimony 
of the divinity of the mission of 
Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of th° 
world. I know, as I know that I 
live, that He is what we believe 
Him to be. I know that there is no 
other name under heaven wherebv 
we may hope to gain exaltation, but 
the name of Jesus Christ, our 
Savior. There is no other Gospel 
of salvation, and we. my brethren 
who bear the holv priesthood, have 
the responsibility of carrying that 
message, not only to the nations of 
the earth, but of exemplifying it in 
our lives and teaching it to those 
who are our neighbors, not of our 
faith. I warn you this day that the 
Lord holds us responsible to call 
' His children to repentance and for 
the promulgation of His truth. If 



we fail to take advantage of our 
opportunities to teach the sons and 
daughters of God, who are not of 
our faith, who dwell in our midst, 
this Gospel of our Lord, He will 
require at our hands on the other 
side of the veil what we have failed 
to do, so let us not be recreant. 

I rejoice that a wave of prohibi- 
tion is spreading over the land — 
another evidence of the Spirit of 
the Lord. I desire to read a testi- 
mony that is of the utmost im- 
portance with reference to the use 
of liquor and of tobacco. Wise 
men have testified that these things 
are not good, but I want to read to 
you the testimony of the Father of 
our spirits, the God who created us 
and who has placed us here that we 
might gain an exaltation. He says 
with reference to these things : 

"And, again, strong drinks are 
not for the belly, but for the wash- 
ing of your bodies." 

And again, "Tobacco is not for 
the body, neither for the belly and 
is not good for man." 

What greater evidence should 
the Latter-day Saints require of the 
futility and the unwisdom of using 
those things, than the word of our 
Creator who gave us life? T am 
grateful that in the world men are 
beginning to understand. If they 
will not comprehend the scriptures, 
then by experience they are learn- 
ing the lessons that our Father 
would have us know, that if we 
will keep His commandments, we 
will enjoy life here and farther 
than that, it will prepare us for the 
life beyond the veil. Oh, how 
°Tatefu1 I am for the knowledge 
that my Heavenly Father has given 
me. I know that Joseph Smith was 
n nr^ohot of the living- God and that 
the revelations given by our Father 
through him are for our uplift and

our exaltation if we will only obey 
them. 

Brethren and sisters, let us do 
our part, let us this day make up 
our minds that from henceforth we 
will use our influence to drive from 
our midst every evil thing, by be- 
ginning at home, setting our own 
houses in order and then radiating 
our influence in love and kindness 
and by good works wherever pos- 
sible. It is only a question of time 
until the liquor interests of this 
country will be banished and I hope 
and pray that the Latter-clay Saints 
will see to it that when they choose 
men to represent them in the State 
or Nation, that they will exercise 
their franchise as our Father in 
Heaven would have them do, and 
see to it that honorable men and 
good men are placed in positions 
who will remove from us, so far as 
possible, the temptations of the ad- 
versary, that our boys and girls 
may grow up in the nurture and ad- 
monition of the Lord and gain eter- 
nal life. May the Lord add His 
blessings, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Jerusalem, my Glorious Home." 

Elder Theodore Erandlcy pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 
2 p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m.. President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hvmn. "Come, come, ye Saints, 
no toil nor labor fear." 

Elder German E. Ellsworth, of- 
fered the invocation. 



The choir sang the hymn, "Lo ! 
the mighty God appearing." 

ELDER PHILIP H. HURST. 
(Of Juarez Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
I can say that it is indeed a surprise 
unto me to be called to this position, 
to address the Latter-day Saints in 
the general conference of the 
Church. I feel my unworthiness, 
my inability to say anything unto 
you that would be edifying or in- 
structive, unless the Lord will be 
with me and assist me upon this oc- 
casion. 

I want to say, in beginning, that I 
do know that this is the work of 
the Lord ; that I have a testimony 
in regard to the truth of the Gos- 
pel we have received. I have been 
endeavoring to bear this testimony 
to all those I have come in contact 
with, and especially during the last 
three or four years, since my lot has 
been cast in the city of El Paso, 
among people who are not of our 
faith. I have endeavored to pro- 
claim the Gospel unto them. A 
number of years ago our brethren 
endeavored to do missionary work 
in that. city, but at that time were 
unable to accomplish anything, on 
account of the prejudices of the 
people, but since our people have 
come out from Mexico, many from 
our colonies have resided in the 
city. We have become acquainted 
with manv of the people of El 
Paso, and have been enabled to re- 
move a great deal of prejudice 
from their minds and hearts. At 
the present time we have some el- 
ders preaching upon the streets, and 
holding meetings, and the results 
of their labors have been very sat- 
isfactory. 

While T have not been in the 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



colonies for - some months, I have 
been upon the border, and probably 
we have had more excitement im- 
mediately along the border than 
what our brethren have had in the 
colonies. The missionary work has 
been hindered to a certain extent 
during those trying times. I want 
to say, in regard to the preservation 
of our people, that men who are 
unbelievers, who do not have the 
faith that the Latter-day Saints 
have, admit that our people have 
been miraculously preserved. We 
all admit that. We believe that the 
Lord is handling- the nations of the 
earth, and we believe that He has 
raised up friends who have come 
to the assistance of our people in 
their time of need. All of you 
know, or have heard of, that great 
general and soldier, Hugh L. Scott, 
who was in command of the bor- 
der patrol for a number of years. 
T have met this great man and 
talked with him, on a number of oc- 
casions, and he always wanted to 
talk about the Latter-day Saints ; he 
wanted to know something about 
the Book of Mormon, the history of 
the American Indians. T made the 
General a present of a copy of the 
Look of Mormon, and he said he 
would read it, and he took it with 
him when he went to Washing-ton. 
He has said to me, repeatedly, "Mr. 
Hurst, I am a soldier, my orders at 
the present time are for me to stav 
on this side of the border, but if 
the time ever comes when we are 
ordered to go to the other side, let 
me know what I can do for your 
people and we will do it." In the 
present emergency, we feel, as I 
said before, that the Lord pre- 
served our people in the colonies : 
the danger that they would be de- 
stroyed seemed threatening, but it 



passed them before the United 
States forces arrived there. We do 
believe that, had they not have ar- 
rived those bandit marauders, 
would have returned, and massa- 
cred our people. It seemed a great 
contrast to me to what the condi- 
tions were many years ago. I re- 
marked to our people in meeting, 
the other Sunday in El Paso, that 
it looked to me like a great change 
has come over the American peo- 
ple, in this great land of ours. You 
know that once there was an army 
hastening to these valleys of the 
mountains with the avowed purpose 
of destroying- the Latter-day 
Saints ; but we recently had an ex- 
ample of American cavalry riding 
om forced marches across the plains 
and deserts of Mexico to preserve 
some of the Latter-day Saints. We 
feel that a great change has come 
over the people of this great nation 
in their feelings towards us. I want 
to say that, during our sojourn in 
El Paso, we have been able to make 
friends among the best men in that 
city, men of influence, representa- 
tives of the President of the United 
States and of the State Depart- 
ment. These men have worked un- 
ceasingly and untiringly for the 
safety and salvation of the Latter- 
day Saints in the colonies of Mex- 
ico. A few have criticized and 
said, "We owe them nothing; they 
have paid no attention to the request 
of the United States Government, 
when they were asked to withdraw 
from Mexico." But many other 
men, greater than these, have said, 
"They are our own people, our own 
flesh and blood, and we must con- 
tinue to work for their safety and 
preservation." 

None of us know what the end 
of this trouble will be in Mexico.

You all know the revolutionary 
condition has continued now for 
over five years. At times it has 
seemed as though a stable govern- 
ment would be established among 
that people, but just as soon as 
that appeared about to be accomp- 
lished, we find them dividing again, 
turning against each other and 
starting new revolutions. It 
seems, to us who have been ob- 
servers of this situation, that those 
people are unable to control the sit- 
uation, and establish a government 
among themselves. The spirit of 
confidence in each other does not 
exist. It seems to us that the time 
must come, if it has not already 
come, when some power other than 
that which they possess will have 
to be exercised for the establish- 
ment of a stable government in that 
land, under which the people's lives 
will be protected, and their prop- 
erty and rights will not be molested. 
In looking over the situation of 
our people we find that, although 
our lives have been preserved, we 
have been robbed, plundered, and 
peeled by all factions, none of them 
have passed us by. I have won- 
dered whether we would be able to 
hold on until peace is established. 
As far as this world's goods are 
concerned, it has been a losing- 
proposition with us from the com- 
mencement' of this trouble until the 
present time. Our horses and 
wagons have been taken, our fences 
have been destroyed, and a num- 
ber of our bouses have been burned. 
The implements that our people had 
new and in good condition, five 
years ago, are now worn out, and 
thev have not got the money with 
which to replace these implements. 
In talking with merchants in F.I 
Paso last Monday, some of our 
brethren asked for credit some who 



need wagons, mowing machines and 
other implements to harvest this 
year's. crop, and the question arises, 
who is going to stand good for 
these things? Of course, those of 
our people who have anything left, 
that they can sell, can dispose of it 
for real money, for American coin, 
but our people have but little left. 
While some of the bandit leaders 
have offered to pay in the past for 
the produce that they have taken, 
they have paid in money that was 
worth, perhaps, two cents on the 
dollar, practically nothing. At the 
present time, we feel that our peo- 
ple are safe in the colonies, as long 
as the United States forces are 
there we feel that they are amply 
protected. We do not know what 
the condition may be if those forces 
are withdrawn. 

My brethren and sisters. I do not 
wish to take up more time this af- 
ternoon. There are others who can 
edify you better than T can; but I 
want to say again, as I said in the 
beginning of my remarks, that I 
do know that the Gospel is true,' that 
the hand of the Lord is over this 
great latter-day work and over His 
people. We know that He is able 
to protect us, and provide for us. 
May we live so that we will be 
worthy of His blessings from day 
to day, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

Meaning of immortality — Eternal life 
is salvation and glorification of the 
soul — Man's futile substitute for 
God's plan — Disbelief in Christ's 
atonement hinders salvation — The 
principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel must be obeyed. 

I have been honored, my breth- 
ren and sisters, with the privilege 
of addressing this large assembly of 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Latter-day Saints and our friends 
who have gathered with us, and 
while I occupy this position I desire 
to speak so that all can hear, and 
more than this, I desire to say 
something that is worth your hear- 
ing. In this I am sure you can very 
materially aid me. "The effectual 
fervent prayer of a righteous man 
availeth much." It is also true that 
the prayers and faith of many 
righteous men and women availeth 
much with the Lord. I desire to 
feel that I am in the presence of 
the Lord, and that you are in His 
presence and that we are influenced 
by His presence and by His Spirit, 
for I desire to say those things only 
which the Lord would have me to 
say, on this occasion. 

I have thought to use as my text 
the word of the Lord to His ser- 
vant Moses, as it is recorded in 
the Pearl of Great Price, Book of 
Moses, first chapter, 39th verse, 
which reads as follows: "For be- 
hold, this is my work and my glory, 
to bring to pass the immortality 
and eternal life of man." This be- 
ing the work and glory of the Lord, 
which I take to mean the all im- 
portant work of the Lord, it is im- 
portant that we analyze this expres- 
sion, and obtain, if possible, a prop- 
er understanding of its meaning. 

The word immortal means not 
mortal; that is, not subject to the 
power of death. I would define im- 
mortality as being that state to 
which we attain in the progress of 
life when we haVe passed through 
death and the resurrection, the 
spirit and body being reunited and 
inseparably connected, constituting 
the soul of man prepared to receive 
a fulness of the glory of God. Im- 
mortality is a means to an end, the 
end being the accomplishment of 
man's eternal salvation and glory. 



In support of this statement, I call 
attention to the word of the Lord 
to the Prophet Joseph, as recorded 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 
93, verses 33 and 34, as follows : 
"For man is Spirit. The elements 
are eternal, and spirit and element, 
inseparably connected, receiveth a 
fulness of joy, and when separated, 
man can not receive a fulness of 
joy." Hence the importance of 
bringing about the immortality of 
man. 

The eternal life here referred to 
means something more than that 
man shall not cease to live. I read 
the word of the Lord from Doctrine 
and Covenants, Sec. 14, verse 7, as 
follows : "And, if you keep my com- 
mandments and endure to the end, 
you shall have eternal life, which 
gift is the greatest of all the gifts 
of God." The revelations of the 
Lord indicate to us the height, 
depth and grandeur of the glory of 
God to which the righteous may at- 
tain. Eternal life, as here used, be- 
ing the greatest gift of God, must 
include a fulness of glory of God, 
in His celestial kingdom. 

The Lord uses the expressions 
"eternal life" and "salvation" syn- 
onomously (See Doctrine and Cov- 
enants, Sec. 6:13): "If thou wilt 
do good, yea, and hold out faithful 
to the end, thou shalt be saved in 
the kingdom of God, which is the 
greatest of all the gifts of God : for 
there is no gift greater than the 
gift of salvation." My text, then, 
might be stated in other terms ex- 
pressing the same meaning, such, 
for example, as the "resurrection 
and glorification of man," or what, 
for my purpose, I like better, "the 
saving of souls." The institution of 
the Gospel plan from the founda- 
tion of the world including the cre- 
ation of the world, was accom-

plished with this end in view, the 
saving of souls. I am convinced 
that the Lord never planned nor en- 
gaged in a greater work than that 
of saving souls. All His works so 
far as we have any account, were 
accomplished with that end in 
view, and such is the magnitude 
and importance of the work in 
which we as Latter-day Saints are 
engaged as instruments in the 
hands of the Lord, authorized and 
directed by Him. The Gospel, 
which has been revealed from heav- 
en through the instrumentality of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, with the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints as its vehicle, represents 
the means by which this great work 
is to be accomplished. ■ 

It is a tremendous responsibility 
men assume when they presume to 
set aside the plan which the Lord 
has instituted for the saving of the 
souls of men, substituting therefor 
one of man's making. There are, 
however, thousands and millions 
who have so done. I think it was 
this class to whom the Lord re- 
ferred in his expression contained 
in John 10:1, which reads as fol- 
lows : "Verily, verily I say unto 
you, he that entereth not by the door 
into the sheep fold, but climbeth up 
some other way, the same is a thief 
and a robber." 

There is another class whose re- 
sponsibility is still greater, for they 
have not only accepted a substitute 
plan for the saving of souls, but 
they have adopted as their vocation 
the preaching and teaching of the 
same to their fellows, thus blinding 
their eyes to the simple truths of 
the Gospel, and prejudicing their 
minds against the true cause of 
God. I have authority for this state- 
ment in the words of the Apostle 



Paul as addressed Bo the Gala- 
tian Saints (Gal. 1 :8), "But though 
we or an angel from heaven preach 
any other Gospel unto you than that 
which we have preached unto you, 
let him be accursed." 

I thank the Lord with all my soul 
that the light of the everlasting 
Gospel has come to me as He has 
revealed it, that my environment 
and teachings have been such that 
the Gospel has appealed to me, that 
I have accepted it, and so far 
obeyed it that I have learned of its 
truth. To those who will obey the 
Gospel it is one of salvation both 
in this life and in the life to come. 
Talk about Christianity in the 
world ! If you can find a people 
who have not rejected Jesus Christ 
as the Son of God in the flesh, the 
Messiah, the Savior and Redeemer 
of the world, then we will not ques- 
tion their right to be called Chris- 
tians; but, we do not acknowledge 
those as Christians who deny Him 
in part or whole of what He is. I 
understand that many, if not most, 
of the preachers of today, professed 
Christians, reject Jesus Christ as 
the Savior and Redeemer of the 
world, accepting Him only as a 
great philosopher or wise teacher. 
They have rejected the chief cor- 
nerstone of Christianity, and have 
undermined and rendered powerless 
for salvation their professed Chris- 
tianity. Not so with the Latter- 
day Saints. We realize that there 
is no virtue for salvation and exal- 
tation outside of the atoning blood 
of Jesus Christ, our Savior. There 
is no other name under heaven by 
which man may obtain salvation. 
The whole plan of salvation is 
founded upon revelation and Jesus 
Christ; rejecting these there is no 
foundation left upon which to build 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nor to stand. The ordinances of 
the Gospel have virtue in them by 
reason of the atoning blood of Jesus 
Christ, and without it there would 
be no virtue in them for salvation. 

In this Gospel of Jesus Christ, re- 
vealed to earth through the instru- 
mentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, through which to accom- 
plish the immortality and eternal 
life of man, there are certain in- 
dispensable principles and ordin- 
ances, such, for example, as faith, 
repentance, baptism, confirmation 
and the bestowal of the Holy 
Ghost, etc. Faith in God the eter- 
nal Father is an absolute necessity 
to salvation. The Apostle Paul pre- 
sents this fact clearly to the He- 
brews (Heb. 11:6), "But without 
faith it is impossible to please Him ; 
for he that cometh to God must be- 
lieve that He is, and that He is a re- 
warder of them that diligently seek 
Him." Do men hope to obtain sal- 
vation outside of His presence, that 
they can reject Him or believe Him 
to be but the shadow of one's self 
or of one's imagination ? I think 
that such doctrines are as pernicious 
as the doctrine that there is no God, 
and those who accept such doctrines 
place themselves in the condition of 
those of whom the Psalmist wrote, 
Psalms 14:1, "The fool hath said in 
his heart 'There is no God.' " God 
has given us sufficient evidence of 
His existence, His personality and 
attributes that unbelieving man is 
left without excuse. It is no less 
important that we accept Jesus 
Christ as the Savior and Redeemer 
of man, as has been already ex- 
plained. 

Repentance is also a necessity. As 
long as we are mortals we. will 
have sins to be repented of, for sins 
not repented of will not be forgiven, 
and, in our sins unforgiven, we can 



not attain to salvation. But repent- 
ance means something more than 
to forsake our sins. If we have 
transgressed against others it is our 
duty to right the wrong done as far 
as lies in our power, and, if it so be 
that we can not fully do so, then he 
whom we have wronged is under 
obligation by commandment of the 
Lord to forgive us and the Lord 
will forgive us inasmuch as other 
conditions are satisfactory, for we 
must forgive others who have 
transgressed against us (Matt. 6: 
15), "But if ye forgive not men 
their trespasses neither will your 
Father forgive your trespass." An- 
other condition making our repent- 
ance perfect and effective is the 
water baptism or burial in the grave 
of water in likeness and typical of 
the burial and resurrection of the 
Lamb of God by which the sins 
are washed away. This ordinance 
of baptism by water is fol- 
lowed by the baptism of the Spirit 
or confirmation to membership 
in the Church of Christ, and 
the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by 
those who are duly authorized. We 
are then to go on to perfection, add- 
ing to our faith virtue, knowledge, 
temperance, patience, godliness, 
brotherly kindness, chastity, etc. We 
are to seek after that which is vir- 
tuous, lovely, of good report and 
praiseworthy and obey all com- 
mandments of the Lord living by 
every word that proceedeth from 
the mouth of God. This indicates 
the method of securing salvation for 
our own souls. There is the fur- 
ther responsibility of laboring for 
the saving of the souls of others, 
by the preaching of the Gospel 
abroad, by laboring in the organ- 
izations of the Church where called, 
and by perceptive teaching wher- 
ever opportunity is afforded as well

as preaching, always and wherever 
our lots may be cast, by the con- 
sistent exemplary life. If we have 
uppermost in our minds and hearts 
the saving of souls we will find am- 
ple opportunity of laboring to this 
end. 

I bear my testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, of the truth of 
these things which I do in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

Evidences of continued and acceler- 
ated progress of the Church — Im- 
portant mission of the Church in 
Peace movement — The Saints an

— Vital questions now perplexing 
the world — Present great need of

The proceedings of this confer- 
ence, my brethren and sisters, have 
been very gratifying to me as I be- 
lieve they have to all of the Latter- 
day Saints who have been present. 
The definite, unmistakable manner 
in which the fundamental doctrines 
.of the Church have been presented 
by the Presidency, the testimony to 
the divinity of the work which has 
been borne by the presiding author- 
ities of the Church and our breth- 
ren who have addressed us, the re- 
ports made to us in regard to the 
development and progress of the 
Church during the past fourteen 
years have all been very gratifying 
indeed to me, and T think ought to 
put at rest any doubt, if doubt there 
is, or has been, either in the Church 



or out of it, as to its development, 
its progress, its stability. 

I have been thinking that if com- 
parative figures were available, it 
would be seen that since the organi- 
zation of the Church, eighty-six 
years ago until today, development 
has been consistent and constant, 
that from year to year the Church 
has gained greater strength, greater 
prestige, and that greater faith has 
come to the people as the years have 
passed. I have been asking myself 
the question, what will the next 
fifteen years of the history of the 
Church develop? Where will we 
be, what will be our numbers, what 
will be our increased influence in 
the world, what progress will the 
Church of Christ have made? I 
look forward with optimism be- 
cause I believe that, just as from 
year to year there has been greater 
development, just as during the 
fourteen years of the history of the 
Church, which have been reviewed, 
its progress has been greater com- 
paratively, perhaps, than at any- 
other period of its history, so in the 
future will there be increased de- 
velopment. This is the Lord's 
work and is in the world to pre- 
vail, to become better understood 
and to gain greater influence for 
good among the people. 

T have been thinking if we could 
confine ourselves to this environ- 
ment, if we could always be to- 
gether, if we could always enjoy 
the spirit of testimony and assur- 
ance as the Lord gives it to us in 
these conferences, we ought to be 
a very happy, and contented, and 
satisfied people, and I believe that 
we are as a rule. But we go out 
from these conferences, and find 
ourselves in the world a very small 
part of the world, but nevertheless, 
a very important part of it, because

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the work of the Lord is not con- 
fined to the state of Utah; it is not 
confined to these United States ; it 
is a world work, and consequently 
it must be vitally interested in 
world conditions, and its influence 
and power must be exercised in the 
affairs of the world if its destiny is 
to be accomplished. So as I have 
thought of the peace which pre- 
vails at home, of the satisfactory- 
condition of the Church and the 
comparatively satisfactory condi- 
tion of our country compared with 
other countries of the world, I 
reach the conclusion that our work 
is not by any means accomplished. 
It is just beginning, the influence 
that we expect to attain, the power 
of the Gospel for good, the estab- 
lishment of peace and order in the 
'religious and the civil world, for 
we cannot separate them, is a mis- 
sion that has tremendous possibil- 
ities. Perhaps I should not say 
possibilities, but tremendous cer- 
tainty before it. 

I have been thinking, while sit- 
ting here, of the words of Paul. 
Some of his words have been quot- 
ed this afternoon. He wrote, you 
know, to Timothy whom he ad- 
dressed as his son, one who had 
accepted the truth just as we have 
accepted it. The spirit of those 
epistles, his whole admonition to 
Timothy was that he should con- 
tinue devoted to the Lord, that he 
should retain the faith, never wav- 
ering ; that he should remember the 
law of the Lord which he had 
pledged himself to keep and ob- 
serve; that he should remember to 
honor and uphold the law of the 
land; and being devoted to these 
doctrines himself, admonish all 
other men and women to observe 
them. That he should teach men 
to keep the commandments of the 



Lord ; that he should teach them to 
be industrious, providing for their 
own families, avoiding extrav- 
agance ; that he should teach wom- 
en to be modest in their apparel, 
not adorning themselves extrav- 
agantly. That he should teach the 
poor to be obedient and acknowl- 
edge God in their poverty, and the 
rich to seek righteousness rather 
than riches, admonishing them that 
the love of money was the root of all 
evil, but that if they acquired 
riches they must acknowledge God 
in it and give Him the credit. He 
told him that these things must be 
taught in the Church in order that 
men's feet might be firmly estab- 
lished in the truth ; for he bore wit- 
ness that the time would come, 
which he called the last days, when 
men would be lovers of their own- 
selves, rather than lovers of God ; 
they would be covetous, boasters, 
proud, blasphemous, disobedient, 
unthankful, unholy, without natural 
affection, truce-breakers, false ac- 
cusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers 
of those that are good, traitors, 
heady, high-minded, lovers of pleas- 
ure more than lovers of God, hav- 
ing a form of godliness but deny- 
ing the power thereof. From all 
such turn away, for such people 
he says, are ever learning yet never 
able to come to a knowledge of the 
truth. Comparing the condition of 
the Church with the condition 
which prevails in the world gener- 
ally, I thought of these words of 
the apostle-prophet. Do you know, 
my brethren and sisters,, how fruit- 
less, in acomplishment have been 
the teachings of modern Christian- 
ity? The Christian world is en- 
gaged in deadly strife, nation ar- 
rayed against nation, people against 
people. They have taken up the 
sword one against the other, are

killing each other, and yet profes- 
sing to be followers of the Redeem- 
er of the world, all having the 
Bible, all having the word of the 
Lord as it is contained here in these 
scriptures, and yet are engaged in 
the most heartless and bloody war 
the world has ever known, in mod- 
ern times at least. 

While Brother Grant was quot- 
ing statistics this morning I thought 
of, and during the noon hour copied 
from remarks made in the British 
Parliament, just a few days ago, 
by the Premier of England, these 
facts, that the European War is 
costing Great Britain alone twenty- 
five millions of dollars every day, 
or nine billion, one hundred twenty- 
five million dollars a year — figures 
that are staggering, almost beyond 
our comprehension. Statesmen in 
that country, and not in that coun- 
try alone, for the very same ques- 
tion is being asked here in the 
United States, are asking what can 
we do to be saved? It is not so 
much spiritual salvation that they 
are asking for, but to save our- 
selves from ourselves, for they rea- 
lize that this dissipation and waste 
in the wealth of the world cannot 
long continue, to say nothing of the 
waste in human life and human sac- 
rifice which is being made. So 
these statesmen in England begin to 
look around for means of retrench- 
ment. The English people are 
warned against extravagance, they 
are warned against needless ex- 
penditures ; and among other 
things, and one of the most import-, 
ant things to which their attention 
is being called, is the fact that in 
that country every year there is ex- 
pended for strong drink and nar- 
cotics, that might better be done 
without, the tremendous sum of 
five hundred fifty millions of dol- 



lars, or half a billion dollars every 
year. 

We are not asking in the United 
States, so directly, what we may do 
to be saved, but we are asking what 
can we do to perpetuate existing 
conditions ? Can we save ourselves 
from this world war? Will we be 
attacked? Will our resources be 
too dissipated and wasted? Men 
advocate greater navies, greater 
armies, stronger fortifications, in 
order that the God-given principles 
of liberty that exist in the United 
States, as they exist in no other part 
of the world, may be maintained 
and this heritage of our fathers be 
perpetuated. They are vital ques- 
tions, questions that are before the 
world. They are before us and we 
cannot escape nor shirk them. Now 
there must be a cause for this con- 
dition, and a remedy, and I take it 
for granted that if I see, or think 
I see the cause, and if I see or think 
I see the remedy, it is not only my 
privilege but my duty to say so. I 
asked myself the question, the first 
day of this conference, in what 
does the strength of the Church 
consist? And the answer very 
readily came to me — in the first 
place it is the work of the Lord re- 
stored to the earth in the dispen- 
sation in which we live, divinely 
established through the instrumen- 
tality of the Prophet Joseph Smith ; 
the Gospel in its fulness has come 
to us. We understand it, we know 
that the laws and ordinances, of the 
Church are perfect, but I thought 
to myself, except those laws and 
ordinances are administered in 
righteousness, by trustworthy men, 
they amount to nothing. We may 
have the word of the Lord. We 
may profess righteousness, we may 
know His will, but if the will of the 
Lord is not manifest in our works. 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



works being the expression of faith, 
they amount to nothing. I know 
that you could begin at the very 
head of the Church, and go down 
through all these quorums, to the 
presidents of stakes, the members 
of high councils, the bishops of 
wards, those who preside over the 
auxiliary organizations of the 
Church, and you will find that every 
man of them are selected with the 
greatest care, because of their in- 
tegrity, and integrity expresses it 
all. If a man profess faith in God 
and has integrity, he will adhere to 
God's commandments ; and you will 
find in the Church that these are 
clean men, devoted men. You 
cannot find an immoral man 
among them, not one. You cannot 
find an intemperate man amon»' 
them, you cannot find a man whose 
word is not to be relied upon, you 
cannot find a man who is a hypo- 
crite, who professes religion and 
does not exemplify it in his life; 
and that constitutes the strength of 
the Church, the strength of the 
men who are in it and who control 
its affairs. There can be no strength 
in the Church, there can be no 
strength in the state, except that 
condition shall prevail, no matter 
what the constitutional law of the 
land may be. 

They have just as good a consti- 
tution in Mexico as we have in the 
United States, but there has never 
been men there to execute it. They 
have perverted the laws ; men have 
transgressed the law of God, 
changed the ordinances of the 
Church, and broken the everlasting 
covenant, while they profess to 
speak in the name of the Lord, so 
have men there perverted the just 
laws that have been written into 
the statute books by their fathers, 
until anarchy and confusion pre- 



vail. Now, in the scripture that I 
have read, Paul said the conditions 
referred to there would come in the 
last days. The Lord said to the 
Prophet Joseph, "In the last days, 
even now, the day in which I am 
beginning my work, the angels of 
the Lord stand ready constantly 
crying to Him to be permitted to 
go out and reap down the world, 
for the harvest is ripe." So we are 
living in the last days. Do you 
need to be told that men manifest- 
ing in their lives the condition re- 
ferred to by Paul exist? We come 
in contact with them wherever we 
go, and so I say — and I have little 
fear of successful contradiction — 
that the condition of confusion that 
exists in the world, both in the re- 
ligious and in the civil world, is the 
result of the administration of the 
affairs of the church, and of the 
state by men who have departed 
from the way of the Lord. They 
are not men of faith, they take 
honor to themselves, they do not 
give Him the credit. They misin- 
terpret the word of the Lord, be- 
cause to properly interpret it would 
defeat their purposes. 

Now, what is the remedy? Our 
Church needs no present remedy 
because it adheres to the word of 
the Lord, as I have borne witness 
to you. The responsibility of call- 
ing these men to conduct its af- 
fairs rests with the presiding au- 
thorities of the Church. Every one 
of these men know how they have 
been catechised, how their lives have 
been scrutinized and criticised be- 
fore they are called to responsible 
positions, and they know that they 
must pass successfully that criti- 
cism if they are selected and sus- 
tained as representatives of the 
Lord's work and that if one of 
them should cease to be a man of 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 



59 



integrity and character, no matter 
who he may be, one of us or one 
of them, the minute we depart from 
the way of the Lord, we lose 
our place. The minute we forget 
the obligation which rests upon us 
in His service, no matter what may 
have been our calling, the moment 
we place our personal affairs before 
the affairs of the kingdom, the min- 
ute we seek to gratify our own am- 
bition or to accomplish our own 
selfish purposes through the influ- 
ences of the priesthood, the Lord 
has told us that we lose the power 
that He has given us, and amen to 
the priesthood or authority of that 
man. He cannot be an immoral or 
wicked man and hold his place in 
the Church. Just as long as that 
condition continues, the Church is 
absolutely safe. 

The state needs the very same 
thing. 1 am going to assume to 
say that the one thing in the world 
that is needed today, the one great 
preparedness that the world needs 
is the men — men of integrity, men 
of faith, men of economy, men of 
industry, men who will control and 
manage your public affairs as you 
manage and control your private 
affairs, men selected by the voice 
of the people. 

If conditions of confusion exist 
in the world I always look to the 
word of the Lord for a remedy, be- 
cause I believe in it, I believe in it 
as He gave it to His people an- 
ciently, I believe in it as He re- 
vealed it to us through His prophet 
in this dispensation, I believe in it 
as it comes to us through living or- 
acles of God who declare His word 
to us in the day in which we live. 
Tf the word of the Lord is to be de- 
pended upon the safety and de- 
velopment and welfare of the peo- 
ple of all nations depends upon the 



selection of good men, and honest 
men, and righteous men to repre- 
sent them in public affairs. 

How are you going to separate 
the church from the state ? The 
state controls the church abso- 
lutely, controls your property, con- 
trols your lives. It takes your 
property from you if it wishes, it 
presses you into service, it declares 
war or makes peace and you cannot 
avoid it, however much you may 
desire, and however much we may 
claim that we are independent, that 
what we have belongs to us. After 
all the finality is that the state con- 
trols us. Is it necessary or im- 
portant, then, that good men ad- 
minister public affairs, trustworthy 
men ? It seems to me that it is ; 
not only necessary, but absolutely 
indispensable, and that is the rea- 
son I am calling your attention to 
it. There can be no peace, there 
can be no perpetuity of the institu- 
tions of this country without it, 
there can be no proper development 
in this state of ours without it. 

I don't know that I need take 
time to read it to you, but here, in 
the Doctrine and Covenants, the 
Lord tells us that in order that these 
conditions may be maintained it is 
our duty to seek out good men, and 
wise men and just men to control 
our civil affairs. I want to put 
emphasis on these words "Seek 
out." It seems to me that it has 
almost come to a point when, in- 
stead of seeking out men to serve 
us, we sit suplinely down and let 
the men seek the office and hunt 
their way in. A man said to me the 
other day, "I have been approached 
and asked to run for governor. I 
have been told that if I can put up 
ten thousand dollars I will have a 
good chance to be elected." That 
kind of politics is dangerous. Men 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ought to be sought out by the peo- 
ple. Do you know what the Lord 
said to the Nephites who lived upon 
this continent of ours, and who 
were destroyed because of the very 
forces to which I am referring? 
Mosiah said, when they would have 
elected him king, that it was not 
wise, nor proper that a king should 
be elected among them, but rather 
he said let men be chosen by the 
voice of the people to frame laws, 
and administer them. It was done, 
and they administered the law in 
righteousness. For sixty years 
there was peace but at the end of 
that time there came an element in- 
to the politics of the nation which, 
under the very same laws, the very 
same constitution, so ingratiated 
themselves into the hearts of the 
people that the majority voted for 
wicked men instead of good ones, 
and the historian bears record that 
in the beginning of that sixtieth 
year, when the majority of the peo- 
ple accepted wicked men as their 
chief judges and rulers, their dis- 
solution and destruction com- 
menced. 

So it is going to continue to be 
in all nations, and I wanted to sound 
this note of warning. Men who do 
the will of the people should be 
sought for office. Have I had any 
reason to doubt that the will of the 
people will be done, or has been 
done by men that you have elected 
to office, I think you only need to 
review the history of the last six 
years for an answer to this ques- 
tion. In a congregation similar to 
this the Presidency of the Church, 
the presiding authorities of the 
Church, expressed themselves 
clearly and unmistakably upon a 
great issue which was before the 
people, and we voted here to sus- 
tain that issue. The words were 



published, and have gone out to the 
world, and repeatedly you have 
sent men up here who absolutely 
ignored it, ignored your will, for 
I believe it was the will of the ma- 
jority. Who was responsible for 
it? We don't want you to hold us 
responsible. We do not elect 
legislators. You who hold the 
franchise in this state are responsi- 
ble and if you don't want good 
laws, if you want this state to con- 
tinue to stand abashed and humili- 
ated among its neighbors, if you 
want it to continue to sustain the 
two most pernicious influences that 
are at work today in the world for 
the destruction of your sons and 
daughters, go on sending up men 
that will vote for liquor, for open 
saloons, and with them for houses 
of prostitution, and it won't be very 
long till you will get it. I tell you 
that you must control it, you must 
subject it to your will, or it will 
subject you to its will. 

I do not want to be misunder- 
stood on this question. If you are 
like those people to whom I have 
referred, if the majority want a 
wicked man, a man who will dis- 
regard your will send him up ; but 
do not be deceived ; in the words of 
Rudyard Kipling, "Do not allow 
knaves to twist the truth men utter 
to make traps for foolish men and 
women," and lead them to believe 
that truth is error, and error truth ; 
but exercise your judgment, with 
the Spirit of the Lord to direct 
you, and take this matter in hand 
and control it. There has been no 
change of policy so far as the 
Church is concerned upon that 
great question of prohibition. It 
stands right where it did in the be- 
ginning. We are for it and want 
it. 

God bless vou, my brethren and

Testimony that the Lord is pleased 
with His Church officials — Duty of 
Church members to marry in the 
Temple — Man and wife should be of 
same religious faith — Observance of 
Word of Wisdom enjoined — Won- 
ders of sound transmission — Bless- 
ings invoked upon the Church and 
its members. 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
grateful for the privilege of stand- 
ing before you for a few moments. 
I know that this is the work of the 
Lord, and I am very grateful to 
Him for the experiences I have re- 
ceived in His service during my 
visits throughout the Stakes of 
Zion ; I have visited nearly all of 
them during the last three and a 
half years. I have made a number 
of observations, and have learned 
that the Lord is pleased with those 
who preside over the Church, those 
whom He has honored to hold re- 
sponsible positions, who have been 
referred to in this conference as 
the General Authorities of the 
Church, including the presidencies 
of stakes of Zion, high councilors, 
the bishoprics of wards, and many 
others who bear the Holy Priest- 
hood. This is my testimony, the 
Spirit of the Lord is with them 
wherever they are called to labor, 
even from the greatest down to the 
least. 

The blessings of the Lord are 
with this people, yet in spite of this 
condition there are a few things ex- 
isting in our midst with which the 
Lord is not pleased. I have noticed 
this particularly among some of our 
young people. Our young people 
are choice, they are the sons and 



daughters of Israel, the chosen 
blood of Ephraim, upon whom re- 
sponsibility rests in this age. The 
thing to which I specially refer that 
is not pleasing in the sight of the 
Lord, nor to our faithful fathers 
and mothers in Israel, is the fact 
that too many of our boys and girls, 
choice young men and women, are 
not availing themselves of the bless- 
ings of the Lord as administered in 
the Holy Temples. To the Latter- 
day Saints, the Lord has given His 
law, which provides that if they 
abide not by it, there will come a 
time when there will be weeping 
and wailing, distress and sorrow, 
and we do not have to wait until 
after death, either, because we see 
these conditions in this life, because 
of our disobedience, and because of 
the fact that altogether too many of 
our young people, when they mar- 
ry, accept the laws of the land only, 
and not the laws of God, both of 
which are legal and lawful as far as 
this life is concerned, but only the 
laws of God are valid after death. 
This conduct on the part of many of 
our young people, to marry outside 
the Temples, or to marry those not 
of their own faith is not pleasing in 
the sight of the Lord. I counsel my 
brothers and sisters, particularly 
those who are born and raised in 
the Church, to avail themselves of 
the blessings of the House of the 
Lord ; and, if they are not now pre- 
pared to do this, that they humble 
themselves and repent, and prepare 
to live worthy of the teachings of 
their faithful parents. 

Very much has been said in this 
conference about the Word of Wis- 
dom. I believe that the time has 
passed when the Lord will look up- 
on us as a people, or as individuals, 
and, as was said anciently, will wink 
at our failings and weaknesses. I 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



believe that the Lord expects the 
youths of Israel today to live clean 
and pure lives, and leave alone the 
things which He has said are not 
good for us. My exhortation to the 
youths of Israel today, and to the 
parents in Israel, that we should 
obey the laws of the Lord, and ab- 
stain from the things which He has 
said are not good for us, repent of 
our present failings, and live here- 
after in accordance with the laws of 
God. Let the youths of Israel se- 
cure their blessings in the House of 
the Lord, that their future genera- 
tions may not condemn and cen- 
sure them for having neglected 
their privileges as fathers and moth- 
ers. 

I am thankul for the blessings of 
the House of the Lord, and I thank 
the Lord for my present standing in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I know that the 
Lord lives and that He will hear 
and answer our prayers. As a peo- 
ple, our prayers will be answered if 
we will humble ourselves and call 
upon the Lord in faith. We are 
living in an age when developments 
in the scientific world are bringing 
forth many valuable lessons. There 
are many good men and women in 
the world who do not humble them- 
selves in prayer because they can- 
not see and understand the philos- 
ophy of it, they cannot reason it out 
in their own minds. Some of those 
who possess bright minds have in- 
vented and manufactured apparatus 
with which they can send the hu- 
man voice across the continent, or 
ocean, thousands of miles, even 
without the use of wires, but yet in- 
dividuals of such intellectual ability 
do not humble themselves sufficient- 
ly to admit that in the human mind 
there is an apparatus which has the 
power, if operated in obedience to 



the laws of God, to send the human 
voice into the heavens. This is a 
force which the world's scientists 
do not understand at present ; but, 
as Latter-day Saints, we have been 
praying to our Father in heaven for 
many years, and have learned that 
our prayers will be answered as 
long as we keep our minds in tune 
with the Spirit of the Lord. The 
key-note to it all is humility and 
faith. 1 pray that the Lord will 
bless us with faith to understand 
and appreciate the plainness of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and render obedience to it. May we 
comprehend the revelations, live by 
them, and teach them to our chil- 
dren that they also may live by 
them. May the youths of Israel be 
valiant in defense of the truth and 
live worthy to receive the promised 
blessings. 

By virtue of my calling, I bless 
this people, the Latter-day Saints 
in all the world. May God bless all 
Israel ; bless the choice youths of 
Israel that they may have confi- 
dence in their parents' teachings, 
and listen to them with honor and 
respect. May we not turn away 
from sacred things, and laugh or 
scoff at them, but may we have in 
our minds respect and reverence for 
sacred things and sacred rites, that 
the Lord may not withhold His 
blesssings from us. I pray the 
blessings of the Lord upon you, and 
upon the Church from first to last, 
all the faithful in the House of 
Israel, gathered and scattered, that 
the time may speedily come, my 
brethren and sisters, when the pur- 
poses of the Lord shall be accom- 
plished in the earth. May we think 
seriously of the sacred things of 
life, and not turn away from the 
laws of God nor the blessings prom- 
ised to the children of Israel in

Past, present and future — The Mis-

lowed — Prophecies concerning Zion 
and her stakes — Joseph Smith and 
the exodus — -Anson Call's Statement 
— What Brigham Young beheld — 
"Mormonism's" monument. 

"Look not mournfully into the 
past ; wisely improve the present, 
and go forth to meet the future 
with a manly heart." So says the 
poet Longfellow. 

I am convinced of the uselessness 
of dreaming too much upon the 
past, or of speculating too much 
about the future. I regard the duty 
of the present hour as paramount. 
The present is the outcome of the 
past; and it is the great hook upon 
which the future hangs. Its im- 



portance is not to be undervalued. 
Nevertheless, I believe it is some- 
times a good thing to reflect upon 
the past, which is as a guide book to 
the present and future ; to read the 
history of God's people, to ponder 
upon the predictions of His serv- 
ants and their recorded hopes and 
expectations concerning things to 
come. And in this spirit I wish to 
draw the minds of the congregation 
toward a revelation given through 
Joseph the Seer in the month of 
December, 1833, just after the ex- 
pulsion of our people from Jack- 
son County, Missouri. Therein the 
Lord says : 

"Verily, I say unto you concerning 
your brethren who have been afflicted 
and persecuted and cast out from the 
land of their inheritance, 

"I, the Lord, have suffered the af- 
fliction to come upon them wherewith 
they have been afflicted, in conse- 
quence of their transgressions; 

"Yet I will own them and they shall 
be mine in that day when I shall come 
to make ur> my jewels. 

"Behold, I say unto you, there were 
jarrings and contentions and envyings 
and strifes and lustful and coveteous 
desires among them; therefore by 
these things they polluted their inher- 
itances. 

"They were slow to hearken unto 
the voice of the Lord their God, 
therefore the Lord their God is slow 
to hearken unto their prayers, to an- 
swer them in the day of their trou- 
ble. * * * 

"Veril ' I say unto you, notwith- 
standing their sins, my bowels are 
filled with compassion towards them: 
I will not utterly cast them off; and 
in the day of wrath I will remember 
mercy. 

"I have sworn, and the decree hath

gone forth by a former command- 
ment which I have given unto you, 
that I would let fall the sword of mine 
indignation in behalf of my people; 
and even as I have said, it shall come 
to pass. 

"Mine indignation is soon to be 
poured out without measure upon all 
nations, and this will I do when the 
cup of their iniquity is full. 

"And in that day all who are found 
upon the watch tower, or in other 
words, all mine Israel shall be saved. 

* # # # 

"Therefore, let your hearts be com- 
forted concerning Zion; for all flesh is 
in mine hands: be still and know that 
I am God. 

"Zion shall not be moved out of 
her place, notwithstanding her chil- 
dren are scattered; "They that re- 
main, and are pure in heart, shall re- 
turn, and come to their inheritances, 
they and their children, with songs of 
everlasting joy, to build up the waste 

places of Zion." 

* * * * 

"I have other places which I will 
appoint unto them, and they shall be 
called Stakes, for the curtains or the 
strength of Zion." 

Several very important facts are 
here presented for the consideration 
of God's people. In the first place, 
they are reminded of the great ob- 
ject for which this Latter-day work 
was instituted, namely, the building 
up of Zion, preparatory to the glor- 
ious coming of the Lord. Prior to 
that expulsion, the place for the 
city, New Jerusalem, unto which a 
people will gather, to make the 
preparation that is absolutely essen- 
tial before the Lord will come — the 
very place for the city had been des- 
ignated, and from this revelation 
we learn why those who had been 
sent to Jackson County to build up 
Zion were not permitted to accom- 
plish the work at that time. Infer- 
entially — nay, directly, we are told 
what kind of a people will be per- 
mitted to do that work, namely, 
"the pure in heart," for that is the 



meaning of Zion, according to the 
word of the Lord. A prophecy is 
contained in this revelation: The 
colony driven from that land in 
1833, or their descendants, joined 
with Zion's other children, or a 
people gathered out from among 
them, a pure-hearted people, are 
eventually to return and build up 
the waste places of Zion. In the 
meantime other places, called 
Stakes of Zion, likewise appointed 
of God, are to be inhabited by the 
Latter-day Saints. 

How wonderfully the history of 
our people has fulfilled, thus far, 
that great prediction. How can we 
doubt that the God of Israel, who 
has made good His word in so many 
respects, will keep His promise as 
to the greater fulfillment? There 
is no room for doubt in my heart, 
nor in yours, as I believe, brethren 
and sisters, concerning these things. 

A few years after this revelation 
was given, the Church of Christ, 
the Latter-day Saints, were once 
more on the move. They emigrated 
from Northern Ohio, where they 
then had their headquarters, to 
Wsetern Missouri — not to Jackson 
County, from which part a portion 
of the community had been driven, 
but to Caldwell, Daviess, and other 
counties, where Stakes of Zion were 
organized or projected. There the 
Saints gathered to the number of 
about fifteen thousand. But a repe- 
tition of the troubles that had 
driven the colony from Jackson 
County, caused the cruel expulsion 
of the entire body from the State of 
Missouri, in 1838-1839. 

Four years later, or thereabout, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith voiced a 
great prediction which you and I 
are now helping to fulfill ; a predic- 
tion fulfilled in part by our parents 
and grandparents who came to the 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Rocky Mountains to build up these 
Stakes of Zion. I will read to you 
just what the Prophet said on that 
occasion. At Nauvoo, Illinois, un- 
der date of the 6th of August, 1842, 
he made this entry in his journal : 

"Passed over the river to Montrose, 
Iowa, in company with General 
Adams, Colonel Brewer and others, 
and witnessed the installation of the 
officers of the Rising Sun Lodge, An- 
cient York Masons, at Montrose, by- 
General James Adams, Deputy Grand 
Master of Illinois. While the Deputy 
Grand Master was engaged in giving 
the requisite instructions to the Mas- 
ter-elect, I had a conversation with a 
number of brethren in the shade of 
the building on the subject of our per- 
secutions in Missouri and the con- 
stant annoyance which has followed 
us since we were driven from that 
State. I prophesied that the Saints 
would continue to suffer much afflic- 
tion, and would be driven to the 
Rocky Mountains, many would apos- 
tatize, others ivould be put to death 
by our persecutors or lose their lives 
in consequence of exposure or disease, 
and some of you will live to go and 
assist in making settlements and build 
cities and see the Saints become a 
mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains." 

One of the men who was present 
on that occasion and heard this 
prophecy, has left a statement con- 
cerning it which I will also read. 
That man was Anson Call. He lived 
to come to the Rocky Mountains and 
assist in fulfilling the Prophet's 
prediction. He was the pioneer of 
Millard County ; he with others 
founded Fillmore, the original cap- 
ital of the Territory of Utah. Af- 
terwards he established Call's Land- 
ing on the Colorado River, there be- 
ing a project at that time to bring 
immigrants and freight up the river 
to a certain point, and thence con- 
vey them northward into Utah — 
a project that would have succeeded 
but for the construction of the 



transcontinental railroad. Anson 
Call was subsequently a prominent 
figure in Davis County, where many 
of his descendants still dwell. He 
was a man of sterling worth, truth- 
ful, and reliable, and here is the 
statement that he authorized con- 
cerning Joseph Smith's prediction : 

"A block schoolhouse had been pre- 
pared with shade in front, under 
which was a barrel of ice water. Judge 
Adams, the highest Masonic authority 
in the State of Illinois, had been sent 
there to organize this lodge. He, 
Hyrum Smith and J. C. Bennett, be- 
ing high Masons, went into the house 
to perform some ceremonies which 
the others %vere not entitled to wit- 
ness. Lhese, including Joseph Smith, 
remained under the bowery. Joseph 
as he was tasting the cold water, 
warned the brethren not to be too free 
with it. With the tumbler still in his 
hand, he prophesied that the Saints 
would yet go to the Rocky Mountains, 
and said he, 'This water tastes much 
like that of the crystal streams that 
are running from the snow-capped 
mountains. I had before seen him in 
a vision, and now saw, while he was 
talking, his countenance change to 
white, not the deadly white of a blood- 
less face, but a living, brilliant white. 
He seemed absorbed in gazing upon 
something at a great distance and 
said, "I am gazing upon the valleys of 
those mountains.' 

"It is impossible," continues Anson 
Call, "to represent in words this scene 
which is still vivid in my mind, the 
grandeur of Joseph's appearance, his 
beautiful descriptions of this land, and 
his wonderful prophetic utterances as 
they emanated from the glorious in- 
spirations that overshadowed him. 
There was a force and power in his 
exclamations, of which the following 
is but a faint echo: "Oh, the beauty 
of those snow-capped mountains! The 
cool, refreshing streams that are run- 
nine down through those, mountain 
gorges!' Then, gazing in another di- 
rection, as if there was a change of 
locality, 'Oh, the scenes that this peo- 
ple will pass through, the dead that 
will lie between here and there!' Then, 
turning in another direction, as if the 
scene had again changed, 'Oh, the

apostasy that will take place before 
my brethren reach that land! But,' 
he continued, 'the priesthood shall 
prevail over its enemies, triumph over 
the devil, and be established upon the 
earth, never more to be thrown 
down!' " 

Joseph Smith, when he uttered 
this prophecy, when he beheld this 
vision, was standing upon the banks 
of the Mississippi River, fifteen 
hundred miles from where we now 
are. Yet he saw the Rocky Moun- 
tains, and the crystal streams flowing 
from yonder canyons, and I doubt 
not that if he had led his people to 
this land, as he once purposed do- 
ing, he would have recognized it as 
a familiar scene, having beheld it in 
vision, by the seeric gift, before he 
saw it with the natural eye. But the 
Prophet was not destined to fulfill 
his own prediction ; his martyrdom 
prevented ; and the Lord raised up 
another mighty man to carry out 
the project, to become the founder 
of Utah, and the redeemer of the 
Great American Desert. 

Erastus Snow, one of the Utah 
pioneers, declared from this stand, 
in July, 1880, that Brigham Young 
beheld Salt Lake Valley while 
crossing the plains in the spring or 
early summer of 1847 — beheld it in 
vision, and so vividly that when his 
eye, his natural eye, rested upon it, 
he could say with assurance : "This 
is the place." General Grant's fa- 
mous phrase, "Let us have peace," 
is scarcely more noted now than 
Brigham Young's historic utter- 
ance, "This is the place." I notice 
that the "Gentiles" are beginning 
to use it to advertise this beautiful 
valley, which the great Pioneer saw 
peopled and inhabited while it was 
yet a barren waste — saw it filled 
with towns and villages — yes, saw 
it as one great city ; and his proph- 



etic vision concerning it has been 
ratified by the practical judgment 
of one of the biggest railroad men 
that this country has produced — the 
lamented E. H. Harriman, who ex- 
pressed the conviction that Salt 
Lake City was destined to be one of 
the four greatest American cities. 
The point I wish to press home is 
this, that Brigham Young beheld it 
in vision, by the gift of seership, 
just as Joseph Smith had beheld it 
previously. According to Erastus 
Snow, President Young saw a tent 
settling down from heaven over 
this very spot, and heard a voice 
from above proclaiming : "This is 
the place where my people Israel 
shall pitch their tents." 

What availed it, after that, for 
men to come from the Coast, as did 
Samuel Brannan and others, and 
try to persuade President Young 
to pass by this then forbidding spot, 
and establish his colony on the fer- 
tile slopes of the Pacific ? Brigham 
Young knew what was best for 
God's people. He had the word of 
the Prophet, that the Latter-day 
Saints would become mighty, not 
in California, not in Mexico, not 
in Canada, nor in the islands of 
the sea (though there might be 
stakes of Zion there), but "in the 
midst of the Rocky Mountains." 
That was Joseph Smith's predic- 
tion. Brigham Young would not 
go past that prophecy, and to con- 
firm his judgment and his reverence 
for the word of God, he had a vision 
showing him that this was indeed 
the place that the Lord had selected 
for His people. Colonel Bridger 
could not dissuade him from set- 
tling here; Samuel Brannan could 
not ; and after the Pioneers had en- 
tered the Valley, and while they 
were organizing parties to explore 
the surrounding country, their 



68

leader said to them : "Brethren, you 
can go north, south, east and west, 
and you will find many-eligible sites 
for settlements, but you will come 
back and say with me that this is 
the place for our chief city." Driv- 
ing his cane into the soil upon the 
very spot where now stands the 
Salt Lake Temple, he exclaimed : 
"Here we will build the city and 
temple of our God." 

Brigham Young was Joseph 
Smith's executor. The Prophet had 
beheld these scenes and foretold 
these happenings. God had spoken 
to him concerningthem. And we 
of today are participating in the ful- 
fillment of his wonderful prophecy. 
We are building upon the founda- 
tion that he laid. President Young 
built upon it, the Latter-day Saints 
have built upon it, and are still ful- 
filling his inspired words concern- 
ing this western land. 

But will our mission end here? 
Is the State of Utah the proper 
monument of the "Mormon" peo- 
ple ? No. Utah, symbolized by her 
State Capitol, the noble structure 
crowning yonder hill, is the monu- 
ment of the composite people of this 
commonwealth. The State of Utah 
is not big enough to be the monu- 
ment of the "Mormon" people. It 
represents only a part of their work, 
and a preliminary part at that. The 
monument to "Mormonism" will 
stand in Jackson County, Missouri. 
There the great City will be built: 
there Zion will arise and shine, "the 
joy of the whole earth," and there 
the Lord will come to His Temple 
in His own time, when His people 
shall have made the required prep- 
aration. 

Meanwhile, what are we doing? 
We are establishing Stakes of Zion, 
and getting ready to build the Zion 
of the future. We are here only 



long enough to become strong 
enough to fulfill our greater des- 
tiny. The same Prophet who fore- 
told the mightiness of the Saints in 
the midst of these mountains, de- 
clared that the much maligned, mis- 
understood 'Mormon" people would 
yet be the saviors of their country, 
would stand with their feet firm 
upon the rocky ramparts of liberty, 
holding aloft the Flag and the Con- 
stitution at a time when traitors and 
anarchists would fain trample them 
in the mire. They would call to 
their aid lovers of law and order 
from every part of the Nation and 
from every corner of the world, 
and would stand for freedom -m 1 
equal rights, for justice and mercy 
and peace, when all the world 
around them would be at war, one 
nation with another, and every man 
against his neighbor. They would 
protect and maintain the sacred, 
God-inspired principles upon which 
the American Government is found- 
ed, and in due time would go down 
in the might of the God of Israel 
and sweep the land free from anar- 
chy and evil in all its forms. 

Zion, the great monument yet to 
be reared, will stand in the proper 
place, upon the goodly land pointed 
out by the finger of God and conse- 
crated for that purpose. No other 
place has been appointed for the 
New Jerusalem. The "Gentiles" 
used to say in derision that when- 
ever the "Mormons" were driven 
from one Zion they had a revelation 
that Zion was to be somewhere else. 
This was intended to be funny, I 
suppose, though the theme is some- 
what tragic. The "joke" would have 
more point if there was a grain of 
truth in it. It is sheer fiction. I 
have already refuted it by reading 
the word of the Lord : "Zion shall 
not be moved out of her place, not-

withstanding her children are scat- 
tered." Teach these things to your 
sons and daughters. Tell them why 
their ancestors came to this land. It 
was for something more than to re- 
deem a desert, and found a State. 
They came here to prepare them- 
selves for a far greater work, and 
the lion is only crouching before 
he springs. God bless vou. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

The Latter-day Saints have received 
the words of eternal life — "Christi- 
ans" who do not believe in Christ's 
Divinity — Man's reason needs the 
Spirit's guidance — Prevalent disbe- 
lief in Scripture statements — The 
Infinite cannot be comprehended 
by finite reasoning — ■ Falacious 
dogmas of modern scientists — Es- 
sentiality of Spiritual guidance dem- 
onstrated. 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
very greatly impressed, this morn- 
ing, with the many evidences that 
proclaim this to be in very deed the 
place — the place of Zion ; that here 
are found the people of the Lord 
with whom He has made covenant, 
and who have made covenant with 
Him to serve Him and keep His 
commandments ; that Zion will 
grow and prosper until her fame 
shall fill the earth and her glory 
and majesty shall cover the face 
thereof. 

I feel this morning very much as 
Peter did in his answer to the Lord 
after the feeding of the five thou- 
sand, when he confessed the Lord 
to be the Son of God. We read in 
the sixth chapter of John's Gospel 
that the Savior departed secretly 



from the people after this miracle 
was performed, and crossed to the 
other side of the sea of Galilee, to 
the city of Capernaum. The next 
morning when the people dis- 
covered that the Lord had departed, 
they followed Him and asked when 
He came hither, and Jesus rebuked 
them because they had not followed 
Him because of the things He 
taught them, but because of the 
loaves and fishes. He thereupon 
instructed them to seek for the 
meat which endureth unto everlast- 
ing life which He could. give unto 
them. They promptly informed 
Him that their fathers did eat man- 
na in the wilderness which was 
bread from heaven. He answered 
that the bread Moses gave was not 
the true bread from heaven, but He 
was the bread of life, and that who- 
ever came to Him should never 
hunger, and those who believed on 
Him should never thirst. This 
caused them to murmur, and to 
make it more emphatic the Lord 
declared unto them : "I am that 
bread of life. Your fathers did 
eat manna in the wilderness and 
are dead. * * * I am the living 
bread which cometh down from 
heaven." He offended them still 
more by saying, "Except ye eat the 
flesh of the Son of man. and drink 
his blood, ye have no life in you," 
referring to the ordinance which 
He later instituted, the sacrament 
of the Lord's supper. When He 
made this statement they were 
greatly offended, and manv of those 
who had professed belief in Him 
declared that it was a very hard 
saying, and they could not receive 
it. Or, as it is written: "From 
that time many of His disciples 
went back and walked no more 
with Him. Then said Jesus unto 
the twelve, Will ye also go away? 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Then Simon Peter answered Him : 
Lord to whom shall we go? Thou 
hast the words of eternal life. And 
we believe and are sure that Thou 
art the Christ, the Son of the living 
God. 

And I say, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I feel this morning, after 
hearing the testimonies of the 
brethren at this conference, very 
much as Peter did in answering the 
Lord. Where can we go and find 
the words of eternal life? We 
cannot turn to the right hand neith- 
er to the' left for there spiritual 
darkness reigns. Right here are to 
be found the words of eternal life, 
as they are given by revelation 
and inspiration to the people of 
Zion, and we know, as Peter did, 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son 
of the living God. This is our 
message to the world ; and it is a 
very timely message, for the so- 
called Christian world is departing 
from the fundamentals, if they ever 
had them, of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. They are rejecting Him; 
they do not accept Him as the 
Christ, the Son of the Living God. 
Now, I do not wish to be misunder- 
stood, for I realize there are many 
in the world who do accept Jesus 
Christ as the Savior of mankind 
and as the Son of God ; but the ten- 
dency among the religious thinkers 
arid speakers today is very largely 
in the direction of which I speak. 

During the year 1914, and run- 
ning into the year 1915, a number 
of articles appeared in the New 
York Independent, one of the lead- 
ing weekly papers of the L T nited 
States which has a circulation in all 
the states of the Union and in many 
countries abroad. These articles 
appeared at intervals of a week or 
two during that year and were en- 
titled, "What I believe and Why." 



The writers were men who are 
moulding the thought religiously 
and educationally, of the people of 
this land. I read quite a number of 
these articles, and as I remember it 
now, there was not among them all, 
one declaration, clear cut and with- 
out modification, accepting Jesus 
Christ as the Only Begotten Son of 
God, and the Redeemer of the 
world ; and yet these articles were 
written by men who profess to be 
ministers of His gospel. They call 
themselves Christians, but they 
taught most everything else except 
the fact that Jesus of Nazareth was 
the Son of God. They were very 
modern in their views, and accepted 
the theories and the ideas that pre- 
vail so largely now in the world, in 
contrast and contradiction to the 
Gospel of our Lord, as His doctrine 
is set forth in the Holy Scriptures. 
The final article of these papers, ap- 
peared in the issue of that weekly 
for March 15, 1915, and was en- 
titled "The Sum of the Whole Mat- 
ter. What I Believe and Why," 
and was introduced as the final 
paper or word on these religious 
subjects. The author of this final 
paper was Dr. William Hays Ward. 
I want to read to you just a few 
sentences. Mr. Ward said : 

"The sum of the whole matter is 
this: Reason is the last arbiter; our 
own reason, our individual reason, my 
reason, nobody's else. There are vari- 
ous sources of authority. Bible, or 
church, or God, but each one must be 
tested by our personal reason before 
it is believed. We are all of us at 
bottom rationalists, can not help be- 
ing. What God is, whether there be a 
God, we must decide by the best rea- 
son we have. If we are made in the 
image of God, that image is in reason, 
not in body." Now I want }'OU to re- 
flect and remember that. "If we are 
made in the image of God," he says, 
"that image is in reason, not in body; 
and our little reason can and must get

some true view of God, just as our 
little blinking myopic eyes can truly, 
if imperfectly, decry the infinite 
spangled universe. Reason may see 
faintly, even erringly, but it is all we 
have to guide us. It may rest on 
custom, tradition, social inheritance, 
the teaching from childhood of those 
whom we think possessed of more 
knowledge and judgment than we, but 
all our beliefs rest on such reason as 
we have. * * It is by reason that 
we too must test the Bible as well as 
the Vedas, Moses as well as Hesiod or 
Zarathustra. If we find in our Bible 
anything of cosmogony, or history or 
morals that does not approve itself to 
our reason, we must reject it, we can 
not help it. That did not, could not 
come direct from God, but came 
through fallible men, the framework 
and the chord of whose harp was con- 
structed after the fashion of their day, 
and could not sound perfect music. 
Reason prefers our school text-book 
to our Bible on matters of geology 
and astronomy, sifts Bible history by 
comparison with contemporary rec- 
ords recovered from the sands and 
clay of ancient empires; and reason it 
is that judges the teachings of Jesus 
to be superior to the sacrificial cult of 
Leviticus, or the cursings of Ezekiel 
and Amos. Our light is better than 
theirs, for our reason has more knowl- 
edge, more experience, on which to 
rest. The best human reason — I think 
I do not err — whether it looks out- 
ward or inward, finds God." 

And I say it does not ! Reason is 
all right when intelligently used. 
There is not a principle of the gos- 
pel that will not appeal to the rea- 
son of man, for every principle of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ is rea- 
sonable, clear and easily understood 
with the aid of the spirit of truth. 
But man cannot determine upon the 
strength of his own reason unaided 
by the Spirit of God the power and 
saving grace of the gospel princi- 
ples, and expect to find out God. 
He cannot do it! The judgment of 
these men in the world, is not by 
any means as good as the judgment 
of Ezekiel, the judgment of Amos 



and the judgment of Leviticus, that 
is, the word of the Lord as found 
in the book of Leviticus; neither is 
it as good as the judgment of Moses 
or any other of the old prophets, 
for the very good reason that Moses 
and the prophets were led and di- 
rected by the Spirit of God. These 
men are not so led, they have re- 
jected the Lord and in His place 
have set up, as they did at one time 
in the nation of France, the god of 
reason which they worship, and 
which leads them into all kinds of 
errors because of their faulty and 
erroneous reasoning, such as these 
sentences express which I have read 
to you. 

Of course our reason is in the 
form and the likeness of the reasor 
of God our Father, but His is in- 
finite and ours are limited and very 
imperfect. And it is true, notwith- 
standing what man may say or 
think, that we were created in the 
image of God physically, and this 
man's reason unaided by the spirit 
of truth has led him astray in this 
regard because he has rejected the 
assistance of the Holy Spirit. 

I am reminded of an expression 
found in the eleventh chapter of 
the book of Job. One of his com- 
forters expressed it but it is never- 
theless a true statement. He said 
to Job: "Canst thou by searching 
find out God? Canst thou find out 
the Almighty unto perfection?" 
And the answer to that naturally is : 
No, you cannot, unaided by the 
Holy Ghost ! It is impossible for 
man to discover God unto perfec- 
tion by the aid of his reason and 
that -alone. We have the word of 
God for it. Paul tells us in the 
second chapter of Corinthians : 

"It is written, eye hath not seen, 
nor ear heard, neither have entered 
into the heart of man, the things which 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God hath prepared for them that love 
him, but God hath revealed them unto 
us by his Spirit; for the Spirit search- 
eth all things, yea, the deep things of 
God. For what man knoweth the 
things of man, save the spirit of man 
which is in him? Even so the things 
of God knoweth no man but the Spirit 
of God." Or in other words, unless 
he has the Spirit of God. "Now we 
have received," he says, "not the spirit 
of the world, but the spirit which is 
of God; that we might know the things 
that are freely given to us of God. 
Which things also we speak, not in 
the words which man's wisdom teach- 
eth, but which the Holy Ghost teach- 
eth; comparing spiritual things with 
spiritual. But the natural man re- 
ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of 
God: for they are foolishness unto 
him: neither can he know them, be- 
cause they are spiritually discerned." 

Now these modern religionists — 
we have some of them in our own 
city — I happen to think I have a 
clipping- in my pocket from which 
I want to read a paragrph to you. 
This is the purported statement of 
a minister of this city taken from 
a discourse delivered not many 
weeks ago. He said : 

"I for one can't see why men should 
accept the proposition that there is^ a 
hereafter simply because it is so writ- 
ten in the books. What more did the 
writers hundreds of years ago know 
about that than we do, and why should 
we particularly believe them? No 
man has ever journeyed to the beyond 
and returned to earth to prove to us 
we do go on." 

And I say he is wrong! But this 
is the way these modern religion- 
ists reason. Many of those who 
have gone to the great beyond have 
returned and we have witnesses 
raised up in our dav who can tes- 
tify that thev have seen and con- 
versed with them. The Lord Him- 
self, even the Son of God, appeared 
in the Kirtland Temple to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver 



Cowdery and ministered to them. 
The Prophet and Sidney Rigdon 
saw the Son of God in heavenly 
vision and they bore witness of it 
and their testimony is a matter of 
record before the world. They saw 
Him and bore witness, as they de- 
clared it, "last of all" that He lives 
for they saw Him. Angels, who 
are men that lived upon this earth 
and have been glorified, receiving 
their resurrection, returned and 
conferred upon the heads of Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, keys 
and powers and priesthood which 
they held, and this same priesthood 
has been handed down and you hold 
it, my brethren. 

It is the extreme of foolishness 
for a man to rise up and say, be- 
cause those who have gone to the 
beyond have not appeared to him, 
therefore they have not returned, 
that no one has returned from the 
great beyond to prove we do go on ! 
and to teach such nonsense in his 
ignorance to the people, because it 
appeals to his reason. He never 
will receive such visitations and 
knowledge as long as he holds to 
such views, and rejects the Lord 
Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of the 
world. Peter says: 

"We have also a more sure word of 
prophecy; whereunto ye do well that 
ye take heed, as unto a light that 
shineth in a dark place, until the day 
dawn, and the day star arise in your 
hearts: knowing this first, that no 
prophecy of the scripture is of any 
private interpretation. For the proph- 
ecy came not in old time by the will 
of man: but holy men of God spake 
as they were moved by the Holy 
Ghost." 

Now this man asks, what did the 
prophets of old know more than 
we? And Mr. Ward, one of the 
great teachers in the religious world 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



73 



asks the same question, or, declares 
that we have more light and a bet- 
ter vision than the prophets had, 
because of our greater experience. 
And I say unless we are in com- 
munication and fellowship with the 
Spirit of God we do not know as 
well as they knew, for we have it 
in the words of the chief of the 
apostles that these holy men of old, 
Moses, Elias, Elijah — all of the 
prophets of old — spoke as they were 
moved by the Holy Ghost, and that 
which they declared to the people 
was the vital truth. The Lord 
taught His disciples that the mis- 
sion of the Comforter, or Holy 
Ghost, was to teach the truth and 
that He would teach us and lead us 
in all truth; that He would show 
us things to come — which is the 
spirit of prophecy. He would take 
of the things of the Father and of 
the Son and reveal them unto us, 
providing, of course, that we are 
in fellowship with Him. And so 
Peter bears witness that thes* 
prophets spoke under the inspira- 
tion of the Lord and gave unto us 
the word of the Lord. 

We have even a greater witness. 
The Lord Himself has borne record 
of this fact. You remember hav- 
ing read in the twenty-fourth chap- 
ter of Luke how, after His resur- 
rection, He walked along the road 
with two of His disciples going to 
the little city of Emmaus, not far 
from Jerusalem, and the scriptures 
say, their eyes were holden, that 
they should not know Him. As He 
walked with them they were sur- 
prised, thinking Him a stranger 
and ignorant of what had taken 
place during the past three days, so 
they commenced to instruct Him as 
they walked along. They told Him 
how the Jews had taken Jesus of 
Nazareth, the one whom they 



thought had come to redeem Israel, 
and had put Him to death. They 
were very much concerned about it, 
and they were feeling in their 
hearts that all was over, their hopes 
and promises were at an end. The 
Savior listened patiently for some 
time and finally He said to them : 
"O fools, and slow of heart to be- 
lieve all that the prophets have 
spoken : ought not Christ to have 
suffered these things, and to enter 
into his glory? And beginning at 
Moses and all the prophets, he ex- 
pounded unto them in all the scrip- 
tures the things concerning him- 
self." So He testified to the fact 
that Moses and all the prophets 
whose records we have in the old 
scriptures — which today are quite 
generally discarded in the so-called 
Christian world — had declared that 
He was to come into the world, 
suffer and have His blood shed for 
the redemption of the world, to die 
upon the cross and that He was 
verily the Son of God the Redeemer 
of mankind. Thus He opened the 
scriptures to their understanding 
and taught His disciples after His 
resurrection, that these things were 
true, bearing witness and record to 
the fact that the prophets of old 
spoke, and wrote also, as they were 
moved and commanded by the 
Spirit of God. This is what we 
Latter-day Saints believe. 

Now these modernists who are 
instructing and leading astray the 
people of this and other lands, re- 
ject the doctrine of the atonement 
of Christ ; they reject the resurrec- 
tion of the Son of God, and conse- 
quently the resurrection of all man- 
kind. They have discarded entirely 
the miracles of the scriptures and 
make light of the saving ordinances 
of the gospel which the Lord de- 
clared to be so essential to our sal-

vation ; and in the stead thereof 
they have accepted the theories and 
notions advanced by modern scien- 
tists which are evidently false, and 
have taken to their hearts and 
hugged to their bosoms the false- 
hoods set forth in the theories of 
evolution and of higher criticism of 
the scriptures. And why have they 
done this thing? Because the sim- 
ple truth, which is understood by 
the Spirit of God and not under- 
stood and comprehended by the 
spirit of man, does not appeal to 
their reason. They have refused 
to hearken to the words of the Son 
of God wherein he rebuked the un- 
pentant Jews: 

"I have greater witness than that of 
John: for the works which the Father 
hath given me to finish, the same 
works that I do bear witness of me. 
And the Father himself, which hath 
sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye 
have neither heard his voice at any 
time, nor seen his shape. And ye have 
not his word abiding in you: for 
whom he hath sent, him ye believe 
not. Search the scriptures; for in 
them ye think ye have eternal life; 
and they are they which testify of 
me." 

All manner of theory and error 
they teach to the world, declaring 
that we cannot accept anything, only 
that which our reason teaches us. 
Therefore, if reason teaches me that 
baptism is not essential to salvation 
and it teaches you that it is, we are 
both right, which is a contradiction 
which cannot be true ; and unless 
reason teaches us the same thing 
and we are agreed, both cannot 
have the truth and we are not in 
the narrow path, we are not in fel- 
lowship with God. We must walk 
in holiness of life in the light and 
in the truth with proper under- 
standing which comes through the 
gift and power of the Holy Ghost 



which is promised to all who will 
believe unto repentance and receive 
the words of eternal life. If we are 
in fellowship with this Spirit then 
we walk in the light and have fel- 
lowship with God. He who is with- 
out the guiding light of the Spirit 
of God is in the midst of darkness 
and cannot with his reason unaided 
and unenlightened search and find 
out God. 

My testimony is that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, that he did receive ministra- 
tions of angels, and even of the Son 
and of the Father ; that he was 
called to establish this work in truth 
and righteousness, and this message 
has gone forth to the world and 
many — even the great majority, 
have rejected it. However, this is 
my testimony and the testimony of 
the elders of Israel, and may it pre- 
vail, is my prayer in the name of 
Testis Christ. Amen. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

My heart rejoices, my brethren 
and sisters, in the privilege of at- 
tending this conference and listen- 
ing to the testimonies that have al- 
ready been given ; and most earn- 
estly do I desire to enjoy the same 
good spirit with which our brethren 
have been impressed, as they have 
uttered inspired words to us. 

I rejoice more than I can tell you 
to have a name and standing in this 
Church, to be identified with what 
I consider the most wonderful 
movement in the world today, a 
movement, as suggested by one of 
our brethren this morning, that is 
only beginning its effective work ; 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

assuredly we have not reached the 
end for which this work was estab- 
lished by the Lord. When I realize 
the meaning of those words of the 
Master that we are the salt of the 
earth, and that the leaven which has 
been planted with this people should 
work until it reaches the uttermost 
ends of the earth, I feel that, this 
being the truth, this work being the 
very work of God, Ilis precious 
promise having been given to it, no 
power can stay its progress, its 
growth, its development, the con- 
summation of the end that God has 
decreed. If the Lord has selected 
these valleys of the mountains as 
the place where He would establish 
His people, He having decreed it 
and pronounced His blessings upon 
it, this will always be the place, 
though some of us may not be per- 
mitted to remain in this place. This 
will always be the saving work that 
God established it to be, though 
some may not continue to be iden- 
tified with it. The Lord having de- 
creed these things they shall be con- 
summated, all His promises shall 
be fulfilled. 

The world has become impressed 
wtih some of the doctrines taught 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
although they have not acknowl- 
edged the source from which they 
have received their information, 
nevertheless great churches have 
been builded using as their chief 
corner stone some of the doctrines 
or principles anounced by the 
Prophet. Others have wondered at 
the beauty of these doctrines, and 
have been almost shocked when 
afterwards they have heard that 
these were the teachings of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Men have 
wondered why it was that if the 
Lord had such a beautiful system, 
if He had such a wonderful work 



to do, why He did not choose some- 
one else besides a man who has 
been so much misunderstood and 
whose name has been held in con- 
tempt by the world generally. The 
one reason why the Lord did not 
give to the Reverend T. DeWitt 
Talmage, Henry Ward Beecher or 
others the message, the grand mes- 
sage that He delivered to- the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, is because 
He has always elected, as Paul in- 
dicated, the weak and not those who 
are wise in the things of the world, 
not those who are mighty, not those 
who were learned. Not that God 
despises learning, education, nor 
those things that make men great 
in the eyes of their fellow men, but 
He does this that no flesh shall glory 
in His sight. 

When I have witnessed the ef- 
forts of men to try to detract from 
the work established through 
Joseph Smith, rob it of its claims of 
divinity, by trying to find among 
his associates men who had learning 
and education and ability enough to 
produce the Book of Mormon, tried 
to give the credit to Sidney Rigdon 
or to Solomon Spaulcling or to some 
one else, I have wondered what the 
world would have thought of the 
Book of Mormon if the Lord had 
revealed its whereabouts to Henry 
Ward Beecher. Would they not 
have given the credit to man? 
Would the Lord have been glorified 
in this? I feel that the Lord has 
done it just as He always has per- 
formed His work, I am impressed 
by those words spoken by the Sav- 
ior as found in the ninth chapter of 
Matthew, sixteenth verse : "No 
man putteth a piece^ of new cloth 
into an old garment, for that which 
is put in to fill it up taketh from the 
garment, and the rent is made 
worse. Neither do men put new

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wine into old bottles : else the bot- 
tles break, and the wine runneth 
out, and the bottles perish : but they 
put new wine into new bottles, and 
both are preserved." If the Lord 
had a new message or the old mes- 
sage to be re-given, it having failed 
to be preserved, through the inabil- 
ity of men to defend the truth and 
preserve it after the departure of the 
Christ and His apostles, if He had a 
new message of the truth to give, 
new wine of life to give to men, evi- 
dently, in His judgment, He could 
not find a vessel, an organization 
on the earth that could contain this 
new wine. Where could He find 
one in which there was a belief in 
God the Eternal Father as He is ; 
where, one that believed in Jesus 
Christ as the very Son of God, and 
the Savior of the world? He had 
to select someone whom He could 
reveal Himself to, one without pre- 
conceived notions and prejudices. 

When the Lord sought to give 
Israel new promises, and lead them 
into the new land, He found it 
necessary to keep Israel in the wil- 
derness forty years, to try to make 
them vessels who could contain the 
better things ; but they could not. 
They all perished, who were over 
twenty-one years of age, except 
Caleb and Joshua, and only the chil- 
dren who were born and reared in 
the wilderness came into their new 
land. When Jesus Christ came, 
though there were religious organ- 
izations in the world, He could not 
find one suitable to receive His mes- 
sage, so He had to build anew 
again ; He had to organize vessels 
and institutions, an organization 
that could contain this new wine. 
So in all the earth in the latter days, 
there was not, anywhere, vessels of 
organizations that could contain the 
new wine, the very truth of God; 



and so He organized new vessels, 
a new institution, an organization 
capable of receiving the full mes- 
sage of truth that has been given 
to this Church. It will, I trust, al- 
ways be possilbe for this organiza- 
tion to cherish that measure of truth 
that has been given to it, to pre- 
serve it, to receive more as the 
Lord intends that it shall come ; and 
not save it for ourselves alone, for 
we have been given this wonderful 
message for the blessing of all men. 
We are to treasure it with the 
thought, not of selfishness — "for me 
and my wife and my son John and 
his wife," but for the whole world. 
I rejoice that the truth has come to 
our understanding, no matter what 
the world may say or think or feel 
with reference to this message. If 
it is the truth, as we declare it is, 
it will stand, it will survive. 

I read some very comforting 
words a few days ago from an 
eminent author running like this : 

"Had the great truths waited until 
the majority voted in their favor they 
would never have been heard of in 
the world. Had they not found the 
place from which they are proclaimed 
at all times as sufficiently grand, they 
would be silent to this hour. Un- 
adorned and out of the way were the 
seats whence they were uttered as 
they came like zephyrs; and though 
slight their rustlings they uprooted 
oaks and threw down palaces." 

While this truth came in a hum- 
ble and obscure corner of the earth, 
to one out of the way of the seats 
of those who sought adornment, 
nevertheless, though the rustlings 
were gentle when the Son of God 
and the Father Himself appeared 
in the grove, to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, on that spring morning, it 
was the beginning of the establish- 
ment of truth that should grow and

become mighty; and like fire, when 
once started in dead timber, it shall 
burn and consume all that is dead, 
decayed and fit for consumption. 
So the truth, once clearly stated, 
will burn and consume error and 
spread unto the uttermost parts of 
the earth. 

I testify to you that this is the 
truth, that the wonderful message 
given to us is the thing of all things 
that can save and that will save the 
world. It is the power of God unto 
salvation ; it is the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, i do bear testi- 
mony to the fact that I know, all 
there is to me knows, reason is sat- 
isfied, yes, in my soul, by a thou- 
sand testimonies, I know it better 
than I know anything else in the 
world that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, the very Son of God. I 
know equally well that if the Lord, 
who does live, if He ever spoke to 
men, if He ever delivered a message 
in all the world, He did speak to 
Joseph Smith, He did reveal Him- 
self, and I believe that He revealed 
Himself to men anciently as well as 
that He revealed Himself to the 
Prophet Joseph. I treasure the di- 
vine message that has come unto 
us, and I do appreciate the oppor- 
tunity of bearing this message to 
my Father's children. 

Oh, may the Lord inspire the 
hearts of the vouth of Israel, and 
the men and the women who have 
the great responsibilities of demon- 
strating to the world the virtue, the 
virility, the strength and the power 
of this Gospel, so that men mav not 
only be impressed and inspired by 
our utterances but that, seeing the 
fruits of this Gosoel in the lives of 
the Latter-dav Saints, thev mav be 
lead to acknowledge that the thing, 
after all. that they have sought and 
have not found in the forms of re- 



ligion upon which they have leaned 
with hope that it would solve the 
world's problem, and bring peace to 
the earth, is here in all its power, 
not lose their faith in God, nor in 
His Christ, but, that here they shall 
find hope. And may we live to invite 
and anxiously desire all men to 
come and drink of these waters of 
everlasting life which are now ex- 
tended freely to all who will re- 
ceive. May the Lord bless us in 
these noble efforts and in this grand 
mission, to live up to the require- 
ments of the Lord, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Smith announced an- 
other overflow meeting, to be held 
in the Assembly Hall at 2 p. m., to 
be presided over by Elder George 
F. Richards ; and an outdoor meet- 
ing at same time, in front of the 
Bureau of Information, under di- 
rection of Elder Heber J. Grant. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters : I have 
been asked by President Smith to 
say a few words this morning con- 
cerning the organization for the 
World's Peace Foundation that has 
been inaugurated here in the Unit- 
ed States. Yesterday afternoon 
the Utah organization was perfect- 
ed by the election of Hon. Wm. N. 
Williams as president; he with the 
other regularly elected officers, will 
take up the work of perfecting the 
organization throughout the State 
of Utah. At the head of the peace 
organization in the United States 
is Ex-President William Howard 
Taft. The movement has been in- 
augurated for the purpose of incul- 
cating in the hearts of all Ameri- 
can people the virtue of peace, and 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it is desired that such organizations 
be perfected in all of the states of 
the Union. 

Utah is recognized by a great 
many people abroad as being loyal 
to the gospel of peace. It is said 
that we have contributed here in 
this state more for the suffering 
people of Europe than any other 
state of the union in comparison to 
the population. It is greatly desired 
by the peace organization that all 
of the people of the State become 
interested in this movement and 
contribute in spirit and in truth, to 
the cause, that a sentiment may be 
aroused in the hearts of men and 
women, and of the children of the 
public schools, that we may have a 
backing that will count for some- 
thing, and that it may be said that 
our own State is not dead to this 
great message which Christ brought 
to the world over eighteen hundred 
years ago. 

I was particularly interested in 
the words of Elder Orson F. Whit- 
ney. I believe every word that he 
uttered. I know that the revela- 
tion that he read is true, and the 
glorious thing to me is that the 
people throughout our government 
is beginning to recognize the great 
work of the Latter-day Saints. It 
has been recently printed in the 
Alumni Review of the Harvard 
University, that the "Mormon" peo- 
ple established in the Far West the 
most splendid American institu- 
tions of government, and when Dr. 
Turner, of the Department of 
Western History, made that state- 
ment he did it because of his care- 
ful study. But I believe we have 
gone farther and established in 
early days in this state the most 
splendid types of municipal and 
civic government of any American 
people that ever lived. In the De- 



partment of Political Science of 
Columbia LTniversity, students are 
making a study of the development 
of the old English town govern- 
ment of this state. This institution- 
al life which the pioneers estab- 
lished in this great country of the 
Far West is being recognized, and 
the truth of their work is destined 
to be known. 

But the Latter-day Saints have 
done more than establish American 
institutions in the Far West. They 
have established not only economic 
institutions that are wonderful in 
history, but "Mormonism" calls 
every man, woman and child into 
the field of constructive social ac- 
tivity. I believe we have the key 
to the social reformation of the 
world, through the priesthood and 
the different organizations of the 
priesthood of God. But over and 
above all of these things, Zion is to 
be established on this continent, as 
has been pointed out this morning 
by Elder Whitney, and all people 
who wish the truth, and who would 
bow to their God and ask for truth, 
shall know the truth and the truth 
will make them free. They will 
come up unto Zion and be purified, 
and Zion will be built upon this 
continent, and it will be the great 
center of all civilization and culture. 
The gospel of the Christ shall grow 
in the hearts of all, and Christ shall 
reign as Lord of Lords. He shall 
come and the great millennium shall 
be ushered in, but not until the peo- 
ple of the world shall have bowed to 
His great word and recognized that 
Jesus is the Christ. 

So here, in this State, we have 
every opportunity of establishing a 
peace society that will be effective. 
A part of Zion at least will be here, 
and Zion means the place where 
the pure in heart are living. This 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



will be a veritable Zion. We will 
contribute a light to the world. 
The sorrowful, those that are placed 
in all kinds of terrible social condi- 
tions, because of the great war in 
Europe, they will look, I believe, to 
the United States government for 
succor, and in time will they 
kneel in prayer to God and ask for 
the light and truth, recognizing as 
they will, that the truth has been 
taken from the hearts of men and 
that they are in need of a knowl- 
edge of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer 
of the world. We urge that this 
peace movement receive your hearty 
support throughout this state, that 
organizations may be perfected in 
the respective Stakes of Zion, that 
it may be said thai among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints of the far west, tiot 
only do they preach the gospel of 
peace, but they are perfecting the 
Gospel of peace by their righteous 
works. I believe that we have a 
great opportunity, my brethren and 
sisters, of doing a splendid work 
in this State. 

May Zion be built upon this con- 
tinent, may we cleanse our hearts 
and do the great work and make 
the great contribution of bringing 
about the unfurling of the flag of 
peace, of helping to bring about 
the federation of the- world in a 
league of peace, that there may be 
no more war, that peace may come 
and that all people shall look up to 
Zion and know that God is God 
and that He has spoken to His peo- 
ple. May we so direct our lives 
that this message may be given to 
the world. 

I bear you my testimony that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
that He is the Redeemer of the 
world, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, and that the great 
saving message of God, the Father, 



has been revealed unto His people 
no more to be taken from the earth, 
but to spread through the world as 
the great life and light of salvation 
and universal peace and happiness. 
Amen. 

The anthem, "Christ is Risen," 
was sung by the choir, 25 of the 
lady members rendering the solo 
parts. 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Lewis W. Shurtliff. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m. The services were pre- 
sided over by Elder George Albert 
Smith ; and the Forest Dale. Water- 
loo, and Richards ward choirs, com- 
bined, furnished the music. 

The hymn, "O awake ! my slum- 
b'ring minstrel/ 'was sung by the 
choirs. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder George C. Lambert. 

The choirs sang the hymn, "Ye 
simple souls who stray." 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLS- 
WORTH. 

(President Northern States Mission.) 

I am very grateful for the priv- 
ilege I have this morning, in meet- 
ing with you to worship the Lord in 
our conference. I have no wisdom 
of my own with which to enlighten 
you, except I become a medium in 
the hands of the Lord through 
which His Spirit may prompt me to 
say something that will be good 
for our souls. I rejoice in the testi- 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mony I have of the Gospel, and as 
I listen to the testimonies of my 
brethren, and hear their declara- 
tions of its restoration, my whole 
being warms, and I rejoice that I 
also am found worthy to possess a 
testimony, and to be numbered with 
men and women whose hearts are 
set on righteousness and the salva- 
tion of our Father's children. 

The testimony of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith concerning the com- 
ing of the Father and the Son 
grows more wonderful to me all 
the time. Likewise the testimonv 
concerning the visit of Moroni and 
the great mission of the Rook of 
Mormon. I do not know of any 
book that has ever come forth in 
the earth that has so many evi- 
dences and so many testimonies 
concerning its truthfulness. The 
Angel Moroni came and instructed 
the Prophet Joseph Smith concern- 
ing the whereabouts of the plates 
upon which the P>ook of Mormon 
was written, and the circumstances 
connected with its coming forth. 
Joseph Smith the Prophet tells us 
the events connected with its com- 
ing forth, and declared that he 
translated the writings on the 
plates bv the gift and power of 
God. We have three witnesses who 
likewise declare that thev, in the 
presence of an holy angel, handle 1 
the plates and heard a voice from 
heaven, affirming the truth of 
Joseph Smith's words, that the 
plates had been translated by the 
gift and power of God, a testimony 
that they could never afterward 
deny. Eight other witnesses also 
signed their names in testimony 
concerning the plates, and their be- 
lief in the truthfulness of this book. 

The first writer in the Book of 
Mormon, Nephi, tells us that it is a 
true and faithful record. The last 



writer in the Book of Mormon testi- 
fies, in like manner, with a promise 
that all who read it with a sincere 
heart may know of its truth, for the 
Father will declare it unto them by 
the power of His Spirit. This vast 
assemblage of people, together with 
all other Latter-day Saints, bear 
solemn testimony that they have re- 
ceived a witness in their souls con- 
cerning the truthfulness of the Book 
of Mormon. 

My humble testimony to you and 
all the world is that the Book of 
Mormon is true. Along with the wit- 
ness in my soul, the Lord has blessed 
me with inspiration, akin to revela- 
tion, concerning the important part 
the Book of Mormon should plav in 
the conversion of the world. The 
Bible has been scattered throughout 
the earth, and all nations who have 
received it are now called Christian 
nations. The Bible has been pre- 
ceded, and accompanied, and fol- 
lowed by stories concerning the 
great characters named therein, and 
the hand dealings of God with His 
people. I believe the coming forth 
of the Book of Mormon, the de- 
picted lives of its leading characters, 
and the faith-promoting incidents 
recorded therein, should find place 
in the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints. I believe they should be 
well prepared to narrate those 
stories and tell them as well as the 
Christian missionaries tell the story 
of Adam and Eve, of Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob, of Joseph, and 
Daniel, and the three Hebrew chil- 
dren, together with the sacred his- 
tory of Mary and her Divinely be- 
gotten son, Jesus, and His life min- 
istry and miracles. 

In my missionary experience I 
have found that people who are con- 
verted through reading the Book of 
Mormon, are solid in the faith, their

faith seems to be planted firmly up- 
on the rock of revelation. I was told 
today that in war-stricken Europe, 
where the people are left much 
alone, those who are converts to the 
Book of Mormon are not falling 
away from the faith. Within the 
past year numbers of families have 
sent for the elders to baptize them, 
who have read no other literature, 
or received no other instructions 
save that which they found within 
the lids of the Book of Mormon. 

I am reminded that the mission- 
aries who were sent out in the early 
years of the Church, had no other 
literature but the Book of Mormon, 
and this book, together with the 
burning 1 testimony in their hearts 
concerning its truthfulness, and the 
wonderful way in which it came 
forth, was so powerful that it 
brought the honest in heart into the 
Church by hundred's. The char- 
acter of these early converts is a 
strong testimony that there is no 
hetter missionary book. As years 
went by, smaller books and tracts 
were written, many hundreds of 
thousands distributed, but T do not 
believe they have had the same ef- 
fect as the Book of Mormon. In 
the Northern States mission, we 
have sought, diligently, for twelve 
years, to distribute the Book of 
Mormon, exerting every effort in 
our power to place it in the hands 
of the people, that it might fulfil its 
mission in connection with the Bi- 
ble in bringing the world to Christ. 
The distribution of the Bible has 
made Christian nations, so the 
distribution of the Book of Mor- 
mon amalgamates the Latter-day 
Saints, with such nations. There is 
no more powerful record written 
concerning Jesus the Christ, no 
more beautiful stories of blessings 
following faith in God, and no 



clearer explanation of the plan of 
salvation found than that recorded 
in the Book of Mormon. 

I rejoice in the testimony I have 
received from our Heavenly Father 
concerning the Book of Mormon. 
In listening to the testimony of 
President Joseph F. Smith, at the 
beginning of this conference, 
wherein he said he felt like he stood 
in the presence of the Lord, my 
mind immediately went to the time 
when the Prophet Joseph Smith, in 
the woods of Palmyra, as a boy, 
stood in the presence of the Lord 
and His Son Jesus Christ, and how 
He was almost consumed as it 
were, . with the influence of their 
presence. President Joseph F. 
Smith made the Latter-day Saints 
feel, during his remarks, that he 
was standing in the presence of 
Cod, our Father, and we all re- 
joiced in the power and spirit of 
his testimony. The early mission- 
aries of the Church felt much the 
same way. Some of them had stood 
in the presence of angels, or in the 
presence of men who had. They 
had felt the burning influence of 
the Spirit that had accompanied the 
coming forth of the Book of Mor- 
mon and the restoration of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

I bear witness to you that every 
elder who has ever come to the 
Northern States Mission, and has 
sought, with all his heart, to place 
the Book of Mormon in the hands 
of the people, has been made big- 
ger and better than those who have 
delivered it doubtingly. The Chris- 
tian world did not particularly want 
the Bible when it first came to 
them, neither did they sanction all 
the movements that were put on 
foot to scatter it abroad in the 
world. The Christian missionaries 
were not received with open arms ; 



82

but they have persisted until the 
Bible can be found in almost every 
home in almost all nations of the 
earth; it can be found in hotels, 
upon railroad trains, in stations and 
everywhere that men and women 
are wont to congregate. I believe 
the Book of Mormon should fol- 
low the Bible, for in the Book of 
Mormon is found the more simple 
testimony, and a plainer explana- 
tion of the doctrines of salvation, 
accompanied by a spirit that finds 
lodgement in the hearts of the 
honest seekers after truth. 

While we have not neglected to 
bear our testimony in a personal 
way, nor failed to seek entrance to 
the homes of the people, yet we 
have kept uppermost in our minds 
the distribution of the word of God 
as found in the inspired record 
called the Book of Mormon. We 
have encouraged our elders to read 
it when they are feeling blue, or 
homesick, or discouraged, or in 
doubt, for they will thereby be com- 
forted, their faith increased, and 
their courage to face the world be 
strengthened. 

My brothers and sisters, I would 
like to leave this admonition with 
you, that you go home and become 
better acquainted with the faith- 
promoting stories of the Book of 
Mormon, with the strength of char- 
acter of its prophets, and the won- 
derful doctrines of salvation that it 
teaches. Teach your children to 
relate the stories found therein as 
they hear and tell those found in 
the Bible. I believe that the mis- 
sionaries, and all our young men 
and our old men ; should know the 
stories found in the Book of Mor- 
mon that inspire faith in our hearts, 
as well as we know the Bible 
stories. They are beautiful, and 
faith-promoting. We ought to learn 



to tell them that the world may 
know them, for the knowledge of 
the world has not come to them so 
much by reading the Bible, as 
it has come to them by the stories 
that have been told, by the sermons 
that have been preached from the 
Bible. The knowledge of the Book 
of Mormon will spread in the earth 
the same way, if we will learn to 
tell the stories found therein. 

We have sought to establish the 
Book of Mormon in the homes of 
people by selling or loaning it to 
them and pointing out to them the 
good things found therein. On 
our first visit we leave a book and 
point to one or two good things ; 
then go again and turn down a few 
other cornets of the leaves until 
we have maybe 25 or more places 
thus marked in the book. Just as 
soon as we can induce the people 
to read two or three places in the 
Book of Mormon, they will not 
permit that book to leave their 
home. We hope, in time, they will 
learn to value it as thev do the 
Bible, and value the Bible more 
than they do today. 

The Book of Mormon, has, to 
some extent, changed the thought 
of the religious world. They are 
beginningto reverence Adam as they 
should, and no longer consign un- 
baptized infants to eternal damna- 
tion. Easter sermons have been so 
modified that you can follow the 
very language of Alma in some of 
the easter sermons of the Christian 
ministers of todav. That has come 
about, possibly, bv a few copying 
some of the sayings of Alma, and 
others repeating it without know- 
ing its source. If we will learn to 
appreciate the value of the doc- 
trines contained in the Book of 
Mormon, and proclaim them to the 
world, thev will become uncon-

sciously part of the doctrines of the 
world. 

I rejoice in the testimony of my 
brethren and the spirit of civic 
righteousness that I feel is spread- 
ing over this state. The world had 
no revelation concerning the word 
of wisdom which condemns the 
use of liquor and tobacco, but they 
are fast driving those evil things 
from their midst. In one or two 
of the states in the Northern States 
Mission you do not see cigarette 
smoking. I have been at times in 
several cities of 350,000 people, and 
never saw a man or a boy with a 
cigarette. I came here and met 
them on every side smoking cigar- 
etts and yet the Lord told us more 
than two generations ago, that it 
was not for man. We have states 
in which there are no saloons, and 
they are praying there will be no 
state with saloons. When the sa- 
loon was banished from the state 
of Iowa, the 1st day of January, 
1916, there was a great exodus 
from that state. Not one of you 
would have followed the crowd or 
desired habitation where they dwell. 
On the other hand you would have 
been glad to have followed the 
crowd that came in when the state 
was freed from the influences of 
liquor. Every decent person de- 
sired to live in Chicago and eastern 
cities in the prohibition districts. 
The homes are better, the surround- 
ings are better, the people are bet- 
ter. Sometimes we elders have 
to bow our heads when people say. 
"Why do you people in Utah, who 
have the balance power, permit 
saloons and cigarettes" When T see 
states and nations leading out in 
these things, I am reminded of the 
scripture wherein it says the "chil- 
dren of the world are wiser in their 



generation than the children of 
light." 

May God help us to faithfully 
live the first principles of salvation, 
inspire us with the spirit of the 
Book of Mormon, and bring back 
to us the spirit of communion with 
angels, for they are willing to come 
today to all who serve the 
Lord, and court their influence. 
Many elders have had their eyes 
opened, and have stood in the pres- 
ence of holy messengers who have 
been sent to help them in their min- 
istry. I think that the Latter-day 
Saints of all people in the world, 
ought to understand that they are 
children of God, and live according 
to His ways. Follow Him, and 
cast out those evil things that de- 
stroy peace and happiness, and 
drag men down to the level of the 
beast. 

May God help us, my brothers 
and sisters, to save our young men, 
and women, that they may believe 
the spirit and testimony of the 
angels of God, who came to the 
Prophet Joseph and accept the tes- 
timony of the Book of Mormon, and 
the doctrines that it teaches, that 
our light may be the light of a peo- 
ple set upon a hill. May we be 
leaders instead of followers of 
darkened Russia in casting out the 
liquor evil. May we be, as God has 
designed, real leaders, and a real 
light to the world, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President Eastern States Mission.) 

My heart was touched in listen- 
ing to the testimony of our beloved 
President, Joseph F. Smith, in the 
opening session of our conference, 
when he made that statement, very 
feelingly, that we stood in the pres- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ence of God, and that the eyes of 
great, good men who have lived 
upon the earth were upon us. I 
thought then, and have thought 
since, that the spirit of this confer- 
ence is turning the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints toward that per- 
sonage whom we worship, as our 
Heavenly Father, and our God. 
Jesus Christ said in His reconcili- 
atory prayer, which was offered up 
in the olive garden of Gethsemane, 
that "This is life eternal, to know 
thee the only true God and Jesus 
Christ whom thou hast sent," and 
if it is life eternal to know God as 
He is, then I consider it a vital 
question affecting the welfare of 
every son and daughter of God. 
My mind goes back to an ancient 
incident found in the 18th chapter 
of First Kings : 

"And it came to pass when Ahab 
saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, 
Art thou he that troubleth Israel? 
And he answered, I have not troubled 
Israel, but thou and thy father's 
house, in that ye have forsaken the 
commandments of the Lord, and thou 
hast followed Baalim. Now, there- 
fore, send and gather to me all Israel 
unto the mount Carmel, and the 
prophets of Baal four hundred and 
fifty, and the prophets of the groves 
four hundred, which eat at Jezabel's 
table. So Ahab sent unto all the chil- 
dren of Israel, and gathered the 
prophets together unto Mount Car- 
mel. And Eliiah came unto all the 
people, and said, How long halt ye 
between two opinions? Tf the Lord 
be God, follow Him; but if Baal, then 
follow him. And the people an- 
swered not a word." 

Here was a time in Israel when 
they were following after false 
gods, and the prophet of God stood 
up in the midst of Israel and gave 
them a challenge, or gave a chal- 
lenge rather unto the priests of Baal 
and the priests of the groves. He 



called upon Israel saying, "How 
long halt ye between two opinions ?" 
There are two opinions respecting 
God's character today in the world, 
and the message that is being sent 
forth by the Latter-day Saint el- 
ders to the ends of the earth is call- 
ing upon Israel to choose between 
the priest of baal and the true and 
living God. I do not refer to the 
Christian world with any asperity, 
but rather to draw the comparison 
in these two points. The Athenas- 
ian creed says, "There is one living 
and true God, without body, parts 
or passions." This seems to be the 
prevailing idea throughout the 
world with respect to the character 
and personality of Deity. And with 
the Athenasian Creed agrees the 
Apostles' Creed and the Nicine 
Creed, so that we can say that the 
whole Catholic and Protestant 
world have founded their faith up- 
on that sort of a creature. 

It is not strange to a Latter-day 
Saint that God has revealed Him- 
self in our day and time, for with 
that prophetic announcement made 
by the Revelator John, when he 
said that 

"I saw another angel fly in the midst 
of heaven, having the everlasting Gos- 
pel to preach unto them that dwell on 
the earth, and to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people, say- 
ing with a loud voice, fear God and 
give glory to Him, for the hour of 
His judgment is come; and worship 
Him that made heaven and earth, and 
the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

Now, had the Gospel been upon 
the earth there would have been' no 
necessity for an angel to restore it, 
and had the people been worship- 
ing the God who made the heavens 
and the earth and the seas and the 
fountains of waters, there would 
have been no necessity for that pro-

phetic announcement. In the 130th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, the description of the God of 
the Latter-day Saints is given, dif- 
fering with the bodiless, partless, 
passionless god, between which a 
choice should be made. 

"The Father has a body of flesh 
and bones, as tangible as man's ; 
the Son also, but the Holy Ghost 
has not a body of flesh and bones, 
but is a personage of spirit. Were 
it not so, the Holy Ghost could not 
dwell in us." Here you have the 
"two opinions" stated, one that 
"God is a personage without body, 
parts or passions," and the other 
that "God has a body of flesh and 
bones as tangible as man's." Now 
we call upon Israel, "How long halt 
ye between two opinions." We 
might ask with the Savior, when 
addressing the Pharisees: "What 
think ye of Christ?" Is Christ 
God? Is He not the God of Abra- 
ham, Isaac and Jacob the God of 
Israel, the God who made the heav- 
ens and the earth, the seas and the 
fountains of waters? We read the 
testimony of John : 

"In the beginning was the Word, 
and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God, the same was in the 
beginning with God. All things were 
made by him, and without him was 
not anything made that was made. 
* * * And the Word was made 
flesh and dwelt among us, * * *. 
full of grace and truth." 

Here you have the testimony of 
the Creator who "made the heav- 
ens and the earth and the seas and 
the fountains of water." I would 
like to know what purpose there 
would be in the resurrection, which 
is being commemorated through- 
out the Christian world at the near 
approaching Easter ? If He is God, 
to what purpose did He take up 



His body? If the unembodied state 
of the spirit is a higher order than 
the resurrected state, the embodied 
state, then Jesus Christ was farther 
advanced the three days when His 
body lay in the tomb than He was 
when He had burst the bonds of 
death and walked forth with His 
immortalized, resurrected body. 
Can any one ever think that Jesus 
took a step backward from glory? 
Positively no. The greatest stride 
that was ever made toward glory 
was when that inanimate form that 
was put into the tomb of Joseph of 
Aramathaea was reanimated by the 
Spirit, which had three days previ- 
ously been commended into the 
hands of His Father as He expired 
upon the cross. 

Now, the. whole Christian world 
has been teaching the doctrine, as 
has already been stated in this con- 
ference, that the resurrection is 
something else other than the 
bringing up of the body. They look 
upon the resurrection as a sort of 
a spiritual resurrection, or awaken- 
ing of spirit in some indescribable 
way. The Apostle Paul gives us a 
very striking testimony with respect 
to this question, which I would like 
to read. It is found in the 15th 
chapter of First Corinthians: 

"Now if Christ be preached that he 
rose from the dead, how say some 
among you that there is no resurrec- 
tion of the dead? But if there is no 
resurrection of the dead, then is Christ 
not risen; and if Christ be not risen, 
then is our preaching vain, and your 
faith is also vain. Yea, and ye are 
found false witnesses of God, because 
ye have testified of God that He raised 
up Christ, whom He raised not up, if 
so be that the dead rise not. For 
if the dead rise not, then is not Christ 
risen, and if Christ is not raised, your 
faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
Then they also which are fallen 
asleep in Christ are perished. If in 



8G

this life only we have hope in Christ, 
we are of all men most miserable. But 
now is Christ risen from the dead, 
and become the first fruits of them 
that slept. For since by man came 
death by man came also the resurrec- 
tion of the dead. For as in Adam all 
die, even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive. But every man in his own 
order; Christ the first fruits, afterward 
they that are Christ's at His coming. 
Then cometh the end, when He shall 
have delivered up the kingdom to God 
even the Father, when He shall have 
put down all rule and all authority 
and power, for He must reign till He 
hath put all enemies under His feet. 
The last enemy that shall be de- 
stroyed is death." 

Therefore the greatest victory 
ever won by Christ was when He 
broke the bands of death, and when 
the seed of the woman crushed the 
head of the serpent that brought 
death into the world. 

Why, the world is preaching 
Jesus Christ crucified, and they 
leave Him crucified, and they have 
a crucified and dead religion. We 
are proclaiming to the world the 
resurrection of Christ, and we get 
a vital religion, a live religion that 
enters into the lives .of men and 
women and raises them to the lofty 
pedestal of sainthood. If Christ be 
not raised, then is our preaching 
vain. I thank God that we have 
hope as Job of old, who said : "I 
know that my redeemer liveth, and 
that he shall stand at the latter day 
upon the earth, and though after 
my skin worms destroy this body, 
yet in my flesh shall' I see God." 
That is the testimony of Job of old. 
When people declare that God can- 
not be seen they are drawing into 
question the testimony of that right- 
eous man, they are bringing into 
question also the statement of Jesus 
when He said, in that sermon upon 
the mount: "Blessed are the pure 
in heart, for they shall see God," 



and if He is unseeable, then how 
can Jesus Christ's promise be ful- 
filled? Some people claim that it 
was in the death of the cross — that 
the Christ was glorified. I do not 
speak disparagingly, nor do I wish 
to detract from the sacrifice that 
was made on Golgotha's hill, but I 
want to turn your attention to the 
thought and to the life that has 
come through that sacrifice. The 
very fact that Jesus was crucified 
did not make Him the Christ. That 
was the infliction of Roman capital 
punishment. You remember the 
scene at the crucifixion, the male- 
factors upon either hand of the 
Master, who were also crucified. 
Their crucifixion did not make them 
Christs. The malefactors had not 
the power to lay down their lives 
and take them up again as the Mas- 
ter had, who became the Savior of 
the world, by putting under His 
feet that enemy, the arch enemy of 
God, even death. 

It is not an uncommon thing to 
meet people who say that Jesus 
Christ has come for the second 
time. I met a very influential min- 
ister in Brooklyn who declared that 
Jesus Christ has made His second 
advent and come into the world, in 
1874, and is dwelling in the hearts 
of the children of men. What has 
He done with His body? Why, 
Jesus Christ, who was the Word, 
who was with God, who was God, 
took upon Himself that body of 
flesh and bones which Thomas 
handled and felt in his doubting 
moment, and then cried, "O Lord, 
my God," thus dispelling all doubt. 
He no longer doubted. As Christ 
ascended into heaven there stood 
upon the mount two angels also, 
who said: "Ye men of Galilee, 
why stand ye gazing into heaven ? 
this same Jesus which is taken up 



ELDER URIAH E. MILLER 



87 



from you into heaven shall so come 
in like manner as ye have seen Him 
go into heaven." Then He has not 
descended, in 1874, as His apos- 
tles saw Him ascend. 

To show the necessity of accept- 
ing Jesus Christ as being a person- 
age, possessed of a body of flesh, I 
want to bring to your attention the 
testimony of John, recorded in the 
fourth chapter of his first epistle : 
"Beloved, believe not every spirit, 
but try the spirits, whether they are 
of God, because many false proph- 
ets are gone out into the world." 
Now a key given in the following 
verse : "Hereby know ye the spirit 
of God, every spirit that confesseth 
that Jesus Christ is come in the 
flesh is of God, and every spirit that, 
confesseth not that Jesus Christ has 
come in the flesh is not of God. 
And this is that spirit of anti-Christ 
whereof ye have heard that it 
should come, and even now is it al- 
ready in the world." There were 
people in that day who were pos- 
sessed of the spirit of anti-Christ 
who said that Jesus Christ did not 
come in the flesh ; and when Jesus 
shall, make His second appearance 
those who have been faithful, and 
have become familiar with His 
voice in this life, will know posi- 
tively that it is Jesus Christ who 
stands before them, and they will 
see the marks in His hands and in 
His feet and in His side. Then 
will He declare, "These are the 
wounds that I received in the house 
of my friends." "How long halt ye 
between two opinions?" If God 
is God, worship Him. If this non- 
entity without body, parts or pas- 
sions be God, then worship it. I 
feel like saying, with Joshua of old, 
when he called Israel together and 
said, "Chose this day whom ye will 



serve, but as for me and my house, 
we will serve God." 

May God add His blessings to us 
all, and sustain Israel in all His 
work in the earth, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

(President Cottonwood Stake.) 

I am not accustomed, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to standing in the 
presence of such a vast congrega- 
tion of people. If I contribute any- 
thing this morning to the interest of 
this gathering and for the welfare 
of those who are assembled in this 
meeting, it will be because my heav- 
enly Father, in whom I have faith, 
will come to my assistance and bless 
me with a goodly portion of His 
Holy Spirit. 

I have rejoiced thus far in the 
things I have heard in this confer- 
ence, in the testimonies that have 
been borne, in the doctrines that 
have been enunciated and, above all, 
I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
Spirit that has been manifest 
throughout the conference. I am 
convinced, as a member of the 
Church, that these conferences are 
extremely beneficial to the individ- 
ual members of the Church. I hope 
that, as men and women who are as- 
suming responsibilities of the 
Church at home, that we have had 
our hearts opened to the things that 
have been said, and that will be said, 
that they will find lodgment in our 
hearts, that we shall be able to 
carry the instructions, and the spirit 
of them, to the various wards and 
branches of the Church, and bring

them to the members of the Church 
who are not privileged to be with 
us in the congregations in the va- 
rious sessions of this conference. 

I am beginning to recognize, I 
believe, more than I have ever done 
before in my life, that there is a 
great mission and responsibility 
resting upon the members of the 
Church who reside in the wards and 
stakes of the Church. We are 
blessed, and privileged, to be mem- 
bers of what is recognized through- 
out the world as one of the most 
perfect organizations that has ever 
been established among the children 
of men. We recognize that there 
is one part of the organization that 
is directing the affairs of the 
Church ; and that there is another 
department that is carrying the 
message of the Gospel to the vari- 
ous parts of the world. We rec- 
ognize that in this organization 
there is provided ways and means 
by which the powers and influence 
of the Gospel are brought to the 
hearts of the children of men. 

•In our own homes, the responsi- 
bility is resting upon us, who are 
called to labor, and who are moving 
within the confines of the various 
wards and stakes throughout the 
Church, to do our part just as care- 
fully and consistently as are the 
other branches of this wonderful 
and magnificent organization to 
which I have alluded. I trust that 
we will be mindful, to a degree, at 
least, of some of these responsibil- 
ities that are upon our shoulders, 
for we recognize the fact that, very 
largely, we at home become mem- 
bers of the Church not, as do the 
people in the world, through con- 
version. We become members of 
the Church through the ordinance 
of baptism when we are children ; 
consequently we have a responsibil- 



ity resting upon us to take into our 
confidence, into our care, the boys 
and girls of the stakes and wards of 
Zion, and to give them in their 
own homes, testimony of this work. 

I thank God that He has provided 
in this organization efficient ways 
and means by which we may be 
able to reach the hearts of the boys 
and girls of the Church. As par- 
ents, we very often recognize within 
ourselves that we are not able to 
reach the hearts of all of our boys 
and all of our girls. It becomes 
necessary that the organizations 
that have been provided will come 
to our assistance, and possibly 
through one or another of these or- 
ganizations that are so well offi- 
cered we shall, under the favor of 
our heavenly Father, be able to 
reach the hearts of the boys and the 
girls that possibly we are not other- 
wise able to reach, ,'and be the 
means of instituting within their 
hearts the love and the testimony of 
this work. Of these wonderful aux- 
iliary organizations that have been 
provided, possibly the Sunday 
School with all of its beautiful 
methods, and its powers, may not 
be able to appeal to some of our 
boys and girls ; it may fall to the 
Mutual Improvement people to 
reach them. It may be possible that 
the Mutual Improvement people 
may not be able to interest them, 
but the Primary officers or the Re- 
ligion Class, or perchance it may be 
the Relief Society sisters who shall 
be able, under the spirit of their 
work, to reach the hearts of these 
boys or girls, and bring them into 
the fold of Christ, with a testimony 
of the truth in their hearts. 

In the midst of all of these, there 
are other organizations that to me 
seem superior to all the organiza- 
tions put together, these are the

priesthood quorums of the Church, 
and I hope that the spirit of the 
brethren in this Church will be in- 
clined to the betterment of priest- 
hood work. In my affiliations with 
the work with which I am con- 
nected, I am led to observe that 
very largely our boys, when they 
leave the deacons' quorum, are not 
noticed until we find them recorded, 
possibly, in the elders' quorums and 
when found in these quorums they 
simply have their names upon the 
records, and do not have the spirit 
of this work in their hearts. I shall 
rejoice exceedingly when the time 
shall come in the history of this 
Church that the boy as he leaves the 
deacons' quorum will be trans- 
ferred to the teachers' and priests' 
quorums with the great spirit of 
this work in his heart. He 
then goes into the elders' quorum 
because he is eligible to become an 
elder, and has been educated in all 
the affairs of the Church, in all of 
the other priesthood quorums that 
have led up to it. 

May God's blessings be with us. 
May we be true to our religion, 
and stand for that which is right ; 
and may our lives be an example 
of the thing that we believe to be 
right and that we bear our testi- 
mony to the world is right, in Jesus' 
name. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. CARDON. 

(Editor of Liahona The Elders' Jour- 
nal) 

I rejoice with all my soul this 
morning for this opportunity of 
again attending the annual confer- 
ence of the Church. It has been 
my blessed privilege to attend these 
conferences for the last 16 or 17 
years, and I have always felt in the 
different capacities in which I have 



labored, that I could not prosecute 
the work required at my hands un- 
less I partook of the spirit of these 
conferences. I am happy to say to- 
day that this spirit is being mani- 
fested among the Latter-day Saints 
everywhere, so that in great num- 
bers we are privileged, through the 
blessings of the Lord, to come to 
this place and partake of the spirit 
that is poured out in such rich 
abundance. 

We do not, nor cannot, compre- 
hend how blessed we are as a peo- 
ple. It is only necessary for us to 
go into the world and see what 
others have in order to appreciate 
the many blessings which the Lord 
has so abundantly bestowed upon 
us as His people, and I rejoice with 
all my heart that His work is being 
so generously carried among the 
children of men within the confines 
of our own beloved country. 

It is a glorious privilege to know, 
my brethren and sisters and friends, 
that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, our Redeemer, and that 
Joseph Smith was a humble instru- 
ment in His hands in restoring the 
great work of the Lord, and that 
we have been made partakers of 
these glorious and blessed privi- 
leges which came through our ac- 
ceptance of the Gospel of the Son 
of God. The world does not know 
that God lives, simply because they 
have not been willing to comply 
with the requirements of our Heav- 
enly Father. If we do His will, we 
shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God or whether it be of 
man, and it has been, in part at 
least, through our having done the 
will of the Father that we are able 
to testify to all the world that God 
lives and that Jesus is His beloved 
Son and our Redeemer. 

The great Prophet Noah knew.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



through the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, that the mission to which 
he was assigned was divine, and 
he went about under the direction 
of the Holy Spirit in the prosecu- 
tion of the great mission which was 
placed upon his shoulders ; and had 
the people of that generation be- 
lieved in that message and humbled 
themselves as did Noah, they too 
would have known that the mes- 
sage which the prophet gave unto 
them was divine. The manifesta- 
tions of the power of God alone are 
not sufficient to prove whether these 
truths are from God or not, but it 
is necessary that every human soul 
who can testify that he knows shall 
be in possession of the Holy Spirit, 
and that can come only through 
our obedience to the laws and ordi- 
nances of the Gospel. 

When the Son of God asked His 
disciples, "Whom do men say that 
I the Son of man am?" They said: 
"Some say that Thou art John the 
Baptist, some, Elias ; and others 
Jeremias, or one of the prophets." 
"But whom say ye that I am?" 
"And Simon Peter answered and 
said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
of the Living God." "Blessed art 
thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and 
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, 
but my Father which is in heaven, 
and upon this rock I will build my 
Church, and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it." Notwith- 
standing the fact that Peter had 
daily ministered along with the 
Savior, yet it was necessary that the 
Lord should reveal unto him the 
fact that Jesus was the Redeemer 
of the world. And so it is with us 
today. It is necessary that we 
should be in possession of the Holy 
Spirit in .order to testify to each 
other that these great truths which 
have come into the world are di- 



vine, and that they are binding up- 
on the children of men. I am 
happy in the thought also, that men 
in these latter-days have seen the 
Father and the Son, and have wit- 
nessed the ministration of angels 
and holy beings, but notwithstand- 
ing these miraculous experiences, 
we, too, may know just as assuredly 
as they of these divine truths, if we 
comply with the requirements of 
our Heavenly Father. The Holy 
Ghost is their witness unto the chil- 
dren of men and unto the world, 
and we can gain possession of that 
Spirit in the same way that others 
have, and this influence and power 
will lighten the hearts and the 
minds of all men. 

I do know that God lives, and 
that He is ruling the destinies of 
the children of men, and that He 
answers the supplications of His 
humble children, and will reveal 
unto them the things that are neces- 
sary in order to go back into His 
presence. I know that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world, 
and that if we will obey Him and 
follow the example and the pattern 
which He has laid for us to follow, 
we will associate with Him in the 
eternal worlds. I also know that 
through the great and mighty mod- 
ern Prophet, Joseph Smith, this 
latter-day Gospel has been restored, 
and is being proclaimed to the na- 
tions of the world by authorized 
servants of God, who are endowed 
with divine authority to administer 
in the laws and ordinances of the 
Gospel, and make it possible for all 
men who will yield obedience there- 
to to know for themselves whether 
this doctrine is of God or whether 
we are speaking by the spirit of 
man. "If any of you lack wisdom," 
the Apostle James has said, "let 
him ask of God, that giveth to 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



91 



all men liberally, and upbraideth 
not ; and it shall be given him. But 
let him ask in faith, nothing waver- 
ing." 

The inspiration of this scripture 
rested so mightily upon the boy 
prophet, that he went and suppli- 
cated the Almighty to know which 
of all the warring and jarring 
creeds was right and which he 
should follow, for, in his early boy- 
hood, he knew that it was necessary 
to yield obedience to the require- 
ments of his Father in heaven. 
Every son and daughter of God 
who will go humbly before Him 
may also know for themselves 
whether or not we speak of our- 
selves or whether we are in very 
deed, divinely commissioned ser- 
vants of the Lord Jesus Christ. By 
that same spirit also we are able to 
testify that President Joseph F. 
Smith is a prophet of the true and 
living God, and a more humble, 
devoted, fearless man does not live 
in the world today. And those who 
are associated with him are men of 
God. There are no better in the 
world today ; and we can, through 
that Holy Spirit, testify to all the 
world that they are prophets, seers 
and revelators unto the children of 
men. 

I pray that the power and the 
Spirit of the Lord may permeate 
the hearts of those who are seeking 
after truth, wherever they may be, 
that they may come into the light 
and partake of the influence, power 
and glory that have come to us 
through our having yielded obedi- 
ence to the laws and the ordinances 
of the house of the Lord. 

May His peace and blessings be 
with the Saints everywhere, that 
they may follow the whisperings of 
the Holy Spirit, and vield obedience 
thereto, that upon all occasions we 



may know for ourselves whether or 
not we are following in that straight 
and narrow way that the Father 
hath laid out for us. That we may 
be saved and exalted with Him and 
His Son and the righteous who 
have fought the good fight and en- 
dured to the end, I humbly pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choirs sang the anthem, 
"Daughter of Zion." 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Strong condemnation of use of intoxi- 
cants and tobacco — Statistics show- 
ing splendid results of prohibition 
in Kansas — Dreadful disclosures of 
an old lawyer — Convincing quota- 
tions proving terrible evils of liquor 
traffic. 

I realize that, in the language of 
the hymn, "the time is far spent, 
there is little remaining." You, no 
doubt, are all tired, but I have 
something which I wish to say to 
this congregation, and if any of you 
do not care to remain and hear it, 
you will not offend me or hurt my 
feeling in the least if you get up 
and go out, and your doing so will 
not confuse me. I have preached 
on the streets of Liverpool and 
London; in Portland, Oregon, and 
in other parts of the United States, 
and have become accustomed to 
preaching to traveling congrega- 
tions. My ideas come just as rap- 
idly when my audience is a moving 
one. We did not start this overflow 
meeting until 20 minutes after 10 
o'clock, and therefore there are 
just thirty minutes belonging to me 
and I give all fair notice of what 
is coming, as I propose to occupy 
them, and it will be all right with 
me if anybody goes out. 

I desire to continue the remarks 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that I started to make in the Tab- 
ernacle day before yesterday. I 
talked as fast as I knew how, but 
did not get half through. I am 
going to cut out fully one-half of 
what I would like to say. 

It is claimed that the saloon, if 
banished from the community, 
causes a financial loss. I want to 
give a few facts as they are told in 
the Anti-Saloon League Year Book 
for 1908, page 26. Pellman, of 
the University of Bonn, tells of a 
very notorious drunken woman 
who died in 1800. A scientific in- 
vestigation made regarding herself 
and her descendants has brought 
forth the following astonishing 
facts : 

"The total number of her descend- 
ants have been 834. Of that number 
709 have been traced, with the result 
that the record shows that 7 were con- 
victed of murder, 76 were convicted of 
other crimes, 142 were professional 
beggars. 64 lived on charity and 181 of 
the women descendants were prosti- 
tutes. It has been estimated that the 
cost to the government of the crime 
and pauperism of that one line of de- 
scendants has been $1,250,000." 

How many of us would like to 
have saloons enrich our community 
by this kind of process? 

I want to give you the opinions 
of some eminent people on the use 
of tobacco : 

Benjamni Franklin — -"I never saw a 
well man in the exercise of common 
sense who would say that tobacco did 
him any good." 

Thomas lefferson — -"The culture of 
tobacco is a culture productive in in- 
finite wretchedness." 

Horace Greeley — -"It is a profane 
stench." 

Daniel Webster — -"If those men 
must smoke, let them go to the horse- 
shed.' 

T. DeWitt Talmage— "The path- 
way to a drunkard's grave and a 
drunkard's hell is strewn with tobacco 
leaves." 



Ruskin — -"Tobacco is the worst 
curse of modern civilization." 

E. H. Harriman [to whom we owe 
more for the development of this in- 
termountain country than to any other 
man not a resident of Utah, and who 
believed implicitly in the future of our 
fair state] — "We might as well go to 
the insane asylum for our men as to 
employ cigarette smokers." 

I desire that every man, woman 
and child within the sound of my 
voice shall be workers to bring to 
our fair State prohibition, and I 
want to quote to you one single 
verse of a poem by James Russell 
Lowell : 

"They are slaves who fear to speak 
For the fallen and the weak; 
They are slaves who will not choose 
Hatred, scoffing and abuse, 
Rather than, in silence shrink 
From the truth they needs mustthink; 
They are slaves who dare not be 
In the right with two or three." 

We hear so much of the financial 
ruin of Kansas because of prohi- 
bition that I want to give you some 
statistics that were furnished me by 
President Henry H. Blood, of the 
Millers' Association of Utah, taken 
from the Millers and Grain News, 
published at Kansas City, Jan. 9, 
1912: 

"Statistics from Kansas. 

"Not only wheat, but morals, 
showed a high quality last year. 

"Ninety-six counties out of the 105 
in Kansas have no inebriates." [Gra- 
cious, how prosperity is disappearing 
in Kansas!] "Six or seven along the 
Missouri border have them." [Please 
do not forget that Misouri is wet.] 

"Thirty-nine counties did not send 
a prisoner to jail last year." [My, 
prosperity is disappearing in Kansas!] 

"There were 912 prisoners in the 
state penitentiary last year, but only 
17 per cent of this number were 
Kansas born." [the 83 per cent, you 
see, brought prosperity to Kansas by 
allowing the state to support them.] 

"Fifty-seven counties in Kansas 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



93 



have no use for poor houses, and last 
year did not send a member there." 
[I declare, thev can't even be char- 
itable in 57 (counties in Kansas— 
haven't even the poor with them.] 

"Eighty-four counties last year did 
not report a case of insanity." [My 
gracious, if there are no insane there 
how wonderfully they must be failing 
to progress financially in Kansas.] 

"The death-rate in Kansas is less 
than in any other section in the 
world, seven and five-tenths per thou- 
sand of the inhabitants." [Thus vin- 
dicating God's promise in the Word 
of Wisdom.] 

"There are 700 newspapers in 
Kansas, and only four of them carry 
whiskey ads." 

The Lord says in the Word of 
Wisdom, in the last verse, regard- 
ing those who obey it: 

"And I the Lord give unto them a 
promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass them by, as the children of 
Israel, and not slay them." 

I thank the Lord from the bot- 
tom of my heart, as I announced in 
the Tabernacle, that all over the 
wide world the doctrines of the 
Lord Jesus Christ as revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
are being vindicated. In Kansas 
they have prohibition and are, there- 
fore, partially living the Word of 
Wisdom and are receiving the 
benefits therefrom, which is shown 
by the fact that the death-rate there 
is less than in any other section of 
the world. 

The great life insurance com- 
panies with their hundreds of mil- 
lions of dollars of assets, with their 
medical examination for every man 
who applies for a policy less than 
$50,000, and two examinations 
where he applies for fifty thousand 
or more, have a death-rate of ten 
per 1,000, or more than they have 
in the State of Kansas. No 
stronger proof on earth, it seems 



to me, can be found of the bene- 
ficial effects of prohibition in Kan- 
sas than the fact that there are 700 
newspapers in Kansas, and only 
four of them carry whiskey ads. 
in their columns. Do you think we 
have prosperity in Salt Lake be- 
cause three of our four daily papers 
carry whiskey ads. ?' 

Now, I intended to quote a great 
deal from a sermon which I 
preached in the Tabernacle at the 
Mutual Improvement Association 
Conference, June 14, 1908, but you 
will find the sermon in the August, 
1908, number of the Improvement 
Era, and I shall read only a small 
part of the sermon, but appeal to 
you to get the Era and read it all. 
Here is something I quoted in that 
sermon : 

"Leaves from the Diary of an Old 
Lawyer: 

"I believe that it will require the 
force of the whole people, men and 
women, applied at the ballot box, to 
effectually blot out of existence the 
great curse to the country, 'The laws 
that license and permit the sale of 
alcohol as a beverage.' I deny the 
right of the government to sell to one 
citizen the orivilege to tempt another 
to commit crime. I doubt the policy 
of those laws that seek to raise a rev- 
enue by the sale of that which de- 
bases the people, it is the prolific 
source of crime and pauperism, and 
costs the country annually a thousand 
times more than the revenue received 
therefrom. I deny the justice of those 
laws that on one page of the statute 
books legalize that which promotes 
crimes and makes criminals, and on 
the next, provide severe penalties to 
be administered to those they have 
tempted to transgress. This little vol- 
ume [larger than our large edition of 
the Doctrine and Covenants] is pre- 
sented to the public to promulgate 
those views. They may be thought 
radical, and perhaps are so; but they 
are the result of long years of experi- 
ence in our criminal courts, and are 
but a feeble expression of my abhor- 
rence of the vice of intemperance, and 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the laws that encourage and promote 
it. 

" 'Tell me if I hate the bowl — 

Hate is a feeble word; 
I loathe — abhor — my very soul 

With strong disgust is stirred 
Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell 

Of the dark beverage of hell.' 

My experience at the bar has satis- 
fied me that intemperance is the di- 
rect cause of nearly all the crime that 
is committed in our country. I have 
been at the bar over thirty years, 
have been engaged in over four thou- 
sand criminal cases, and on mature re- 
flection I am satisfied that over three 
thousand of those cases have orig- 
inated from drunkenness alone, and I 
believe that a great proportion of the 
remainder could be traced either di- 
rectly or indirectly to this great source 
of crime. In sixty-three cases of 
homicide forty-nine have been caused 
bv the maddening influence of strong 
drink. 

Think of it, my brethren and 
sisters, forty-nine murders out of 
sixty-three cases, were caused by 
strong drink! 

"I have seen upon the counsel ta- 
ble of our court room the skull of an 
aged father who was killed by a 
drunken son. My brother and myself 
sat by his side as his counsel, and I 
never shall forget the look of that son 
when the ghastly evidence of his 
guilt was laid on the stand before him. 
That silent yet eloquent witness! It 
was but an arch of bone, and was han- 
dled carelesslv by the jury in their 
investigation, yet it had once been 
covered by a father's gray hairs, be- 
neath it had throbbed a brain full of 
pride and affection for the son who 
was now on his trial for murder, and 
as it passed from hand to hand the 
fearful expression on the face of the 
accused plainly told the terrible feel- 
ing of remorse that filled his soul. It 
was a wicked and most unnatural 
crime, and begot feelings of loathing 
and horror in the breasts of all who 
witnessed the trial. Yet it was not 
in reality the son who had commit- 
ted the crime, but the demon that 
lurks in every cup of strong drink. 



And that cup had been filled and 
placed to the lips of that son by the 
hand of a most respectable member 
of society — a man who had a license 
from that very court to sell that which 
maddened the brain and prompted the 
hand to murder. 

"I saw upon the table the skull of 

young B , who was killed by his 

most intimate friend in a drunken 
brawl at Hartstown, and the respec- 
table proprietor at whose hotel the 
murder was perpetrated, and who sold 
the maddening spirit that prompted 
the deed, was witness to the trial. He 
said he had a license from that re- 
spectable court to sell liquor; yes, 
from the very court then sitting in 
judgment on that act, which was but 
the natural sequence of the license it 
had sold and granted. 

"I have seen upon the table the 
skull of a little child, with the evi- 
dence upon it of a murderous blow, 
inflicted by the hand of a drunken 
mother. Yet it was not the mother 
who had committed the most unnat- 
ural crime. All our knowledge of the 
promptings of the human heart deny 
the charge. Who that remembers his 
own mother and her maternal love 
could believe it? No! a demoniacal 
spirit had violated the sanctuary of 
the mother's heart and cast out the 
tender, loving tenant that once re- 
sided there, and that was the spirit 
of strong drink, sold to the woman 
by a man who held a license to sell 
under the seal and sanction of that 
very court. 

"I have seen upon the table the 
blood-stained skull of a wife, cleft 
from top to base by an ax in the. 
hand of a brutal, drunken husband, 
who came home from a neighboring 
licensed beer-shop, reeling, drunken, 
and maddened by drink there sold by 
a most respectable dealer, by a man 
who had a legal right to sell that 
poison whose effects are more terrible 
tha" the plagues confined within the 
fabled box of Pandora, and under 
v hose baneful influence 

"The hand that should shield the wife 

from ill, 
In drunken wrath is raised to kill. 

"I once defended a man for killing 
his own brother, by whom, in a fit of 
drunken frenzy, he had been attacked 
with a dangerous weapon, thereby

compelling him in his own defense, to 
strike a blow that had taken his broth- 
er's life. He was tried for murder, 
and in his defense I called the 'land- 
lord' to prove that the murdered 
brother was mad from the effects of 
the liquor he had received at the wit- 
ness' bar. He so testified, vet seemed 
conscious of no wrong. Why should 
he? He had a license from the court, 
and why should that brother's blood 
cry to heaven for venegcance against 
him? Oh, no! he was a respectable 
citizen, possessing a good moral char- 
acter, for the law grants license to 
none other. He had a legal right to 
present the maddening cup to his fel- 
low's lips, and no one should complain 
of him. He had acted in accordance 
with the law, and did not one of Eng- 
land's greatest and best of men say 
that 'the law was that science whose 
voice was the harmony of the world, 
and whose seat was the bosom of 
God?" 

I had the privilege of being one 
of the several thousand that walked 
down Pennsylvania Avenue, Wash- 
ington, D. C, and who stood before 
the Capito' and presented a human 
petition to our representatives in 
Congress to give us national pro- 
hibition by an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. 
I listened to a splendid speech there, 
a copy of which I hold in my hand, 
by Mr. Ernest H. Cherrington, the 
General Manager of the Anti-Sa- 
loon League of America. I will 
read only a few extracts. I wish 
I had time to read it all. 

"The Supreme Court of the United 
States is authority for the declaration 
that 'the statistics of every state show 
a greater amount of crime and misery 
attributable to the use of ardent spir- 
its obtained at these retail liquor sa- 
loons than to any other source." 

Really, is it not too bad that in 
every prohibition state they should 
be losing prosperity ! 

"No state of the Union has given 
prohibition so fair a trial as has the 
State of Kansas. Today t' n °t State 



presents the unparalleled record of al- 
most two-thirds of the counties of the 
state without a single prisoner serv- 
ing sentence for crime, while in some 
of the counties a jury to try a crim- 
inal case has not been called in ten 
years." 

How sad they must feel in Kan- 
sas because of a lack of prosperity, 
in not having their share of pau- 
pers, and just think how in prohi- 
bition Kansas they are robbing the 
poor jurors of their fees! 

"One-half of the people now living 
in license territory in the United 
States live in four states of the Union, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and 
New Jersey." 

The large cities of our Union are 
where crime concentrates. Every 
district all over the fa ; r State of 
Utah, where the Latter Jay Saints 
were in the majority, with one ex- 
ception, went dry when we had the 
privilege of voting on this question 
a few years ago. " Had the people 
of Utah not been robbed of the 
privilege of voting on the liquor 
question as county units instead of 
changing to precinct units by 
amending the existing law, we 
would have had a dry state years 
ago. 

'One-fourth of the people in this 
nation who live in saloon territory 
live in six cities, New York, Chicago, 
Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston and 
Cleveland. One-half of all the sa- 
loons of the United States are located 
in fourteen cities. There are fewer 
saloons south of Mason and Dixon's 
line than there are in the City of 
Chicago. Thirty-six states of this 
Union have fewer saloons in the ag- 
gregate than the City of New York. 
These significant facts, together with 
the well known fact that the vices of 
the nation center in our cities, thus 
adding complications to complica- 
tions, make the great moral and so- 
cial problems of the city practically

unsolvable so far as the city alone is 
concerned." 

Those of us who live in the cities 
appeal to you who live in the coun- 
try to help us to rid Utah's fair 
cities of crime. 

I have here a newspaper clip- 
ping from the Spokesman Review, 
which shows that Russia, Germany, 
England and France have learned 
that they can not win in the great 
war now raging unless they first 
kill whiskey. It reads as follows : 

It is Something More than a War 
Against War. 

"One of the many remarkable fea- 
tures connected with the war of the 
European revolution is that it is not 
only for many of the combatants a 
holy war against war, but for the gov- 
ernments is a war against alcohol. It 
almost seems as if the world at war 
had declared war upon the use of in- 
toxicating drinks by soldiers. 

"No vodka for the fighter is the 
word in Russia, no saki for the Jap- 
anese army, no whiskey or rum for 
the British trooper nor any absinthe 
for French infantry or cavalry. Re- 
ports from Germany as to the use of 
drink by its armies have not ap- 
peared, but doubtless the German 
military staff has no more use for 
drink than have its opponents. 

"This almost absolute elimination 
of alcohol from the supplies of 
armies in the field forms part of the 
modern theory as to efficiency in war. 
The inexorable demand for the max- 
imum of effectiveness in the soldier 
insists that his condition in the field 
shall approximate the Sunday school 
standard of conduct. Tommy Atkins, 
Jean Crapaud, Ivan Ivanovitch and 
Banzai Idzumo are far from the Cap- 
tain Falstaff who recognized his Cor- 
poral Bardolph through the redness 
of his nose. 

"The German emperor early in the 
year declared against drinking in the 
army and held up abstinence as the 
military ideal. Kitchener, when the 
war began, declared for total abstin- 
ence and ordered that no gifts of 
liquor be forwarded to the British 
forces. The government of France 
forbade the sale of absinthe at Paris 



during the war. Czar Nicholas has 
stopped the sale of liquor throughout 
Russia and one of the first acts of the 
Russians in Prussia was to shut the 
saloons. The French bill of fare for 
the soldiery omits alcohol." 

Let me tell you one thing about 
Russia. One of the officers of the 
largest life insurance companies in 
the world, on his way to San Fran- 
cisco, stopped off in Salt Lake City, 
and I had the pleasure of spending 
an evening with him. He told me 
that he had found some astounding 
figures in Russia, which were al- 
most unbelievable. That notwith- 
standing the war, because of the 
banishment of liquor, the death-rate 
of his company had been less than 
before the war. He felt there must 
be something wrong,, some mistake, 
and was going to investigate it fur- 
ther. I feel sure his additional in- 
vestigation will only be one more 
confirmation of the Lord's prom- 
ise in the Word of Wisdom. 

Here is something I must read to 
you, although my time is going : 

"According to the Kansas City Star, 
Mrs. James Watson, editor and pub- 
lisher of the Dearborn, Mo., Demo- 
crat, has the following suggestion to 
make to booze fighters: 'To the mar- 
ried man who cannot get along with- 
out his drinks, we suggest the follow- 
ing as a means to freedom from the 
bondage of the habit: Start a saloon 
in your own house. Be the only cus- 
tomer. You will have no license to 
pay. Go to your wife and give her $2 
to buy a gallon of whiskey, and re- 
member there are sixty-nine drinks 
in one gallon. Buy your drinks from 
no one except your wife, and by the 
time the first gallon is gone she will 
have $8 to put in the bank and $2 to 
start business again.. Should you 
live ten years and continue to buy 
boose from her and then die with 
snakes in your boots, she will have 
money to bury you decently, educate 
your children, buy a house and lot 
and marry a decent man and quit 
thinking about you " [Laughter.]

"On the 3rd and 4th of this month 
a remarkable temperance meeting was 
held in Philadelphia. Those in at- 
tendance were physicians and scien- 
tists. Sevaral notable papers were read 
on the increase in the number of 
slaves of alcohol and drugs, the rela- 
tionship between disease and drink, 
and the conclusion arrived at by in- 
surance societies regarding the mor- 
tality of drinkers of intoxicants. 
These are questions of immense im- 
portance to all." 

"Col. Maus, surgeon in the U. S. 
Army, made this statement: 

"During the last year (1912), 2,000,- 
000,000 gallons of wine, beer, whiskey, 
brandy, gin and other intoxicants 
were used in this country at a cost of 
as many billions of dollars. The 
country would be electrified if called 
upon to appropriate this sum to sup- 
press diseases and national epidemics. 
Yet this expenditure is the most im- 
portant factor in the cause of our mis- 
ery, poverty, suicides, robberies, mur- 
ders and crimes, besides the hundreds 
of thousands of deaths and the intel- 
lectually dead to be found in the in- 
sane asylums, feeble minded and epi- 
leptic institutions of the country." 

"Dr. Keister declared that if the 
American people would quit drinking 
intoxicating beverages homicides 
would be reduced by SO per cent, sui- 
cides by 60 per cent, and lunacy by 
33 per cent. [Thus adding to our 
financial ruin!] 

"These startling statements did not 
come from fanatics, but from men 
with exceptional opportunities to 
study the causes of sickness and 
crime, and well equipped for that 
study. We must accept their conclu- 
sions. And if we desire the better- 
ment of existing conditions, the evils 
must be attacked at the root." 

The following is a statement of 
the causes of deaths in the state of 
Kansas for 100,000 population : 

In In

1913 1913 

Nephritis (Bright's disease) 102.9 64.5

When the United States officials 
in Washington received the report 
of the death rate— 9.8 to the 1000 
— in Kansas they would not be- 
lieve it, and so they sent a special 
commissioner out there to investi- 
gate, and the report was substanti- 
ated. I would like to read the whole 
of the Era article by Brother Ed- 
ward H. Anderson, from which the 
above is taken, but my time is gone. 
The article is an additional con- 
firmation of the promise of the 
Lord Almighty that the destroying 
angel shall pass by those who obey 
the Word of Wisdom and keep His 
commandments. I appeal to you all 
to read Brother Edward H. An- 
derson's splendid article in the 
April Era, "For the Consideration 
of Utah Citizens." 

We listened yesterday to the tes- 
timonies at our prohibition meeting 
in Barratt Hall of Stephen H. Love, 
John L. Herrick, Melvin J. Ballard, 
Andrew Kimball and Joseph E. 
Robinson, as to the beneficial ef- 
fects arising from prohibition in 
Colorado, Arizona, Washington, 
Kansas and Oregon. I wish every 
man, woman and child in Utah 
could have heard these testimonies. 

May God help us to keep His 
commandments, to live the lives of 
Latter-day Saints, that we may be 
worthy of an exaltation in His 
Kingdom, is my prayer and desire, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

"Song of the Redeemed," was 
rendered by the combined choirs. 

Elder Bryant S. Hinckley pro- 
nounced the benediction.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder George F. 
Richards presided. The combined 
choirs of Forest Dale, Waterloo, 
and Richards wards again furnished 
the choral numbers. 

The hymn, 'Arise, my soul, 
arise," was sung by the choirs. 

Elder Samuel C. Parkinson of- 
fered the invocation. 

The combined choirs sang the an- 
them, "Palm Branches." 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President California Mission.) 

"Praise ye the Lord ; blessed is he 
who bringeth salvation." This is 
the strain that we have just listened 
to and the burden of the song ren- 
dered. 

I want to read to you from the 
holy scriptures an admonition from 
Paul's great epistle to his own 
brethren, the Hebrews, as recorded 
in their book, second chapter, be- 
ginning with the first verse : 

''Therefore we ought to give the 
more earnest heed to the things which 
ive have heard, lest at any time we 
should let them slip, For if the word 
spoken by angels was steadfast, and 
every transgression and disobedience 
received a just recompense of reward; 
How shall we escape if we neglect so 
great salvation; which at the first be- 
gan to be spoken by the Lord, and 
was confirmed unto us by them that 
heard him; God also bearing them 
witness, both with signs and wonders, 
and with divers miracles, according 
to his own will?" 

I have thought that we may be 
well admonished in this day by this 
exhortation of Paul's just as well 
as the ancient Saints, for God has 



borne witness in this day and age. 
He has revealed Himself anew to 
men in the flesh. His beloved Son, 
our elder brother, the first born 
among many brethren in our pri- 
meval childhood, in the pre-mortal 
life, born of woman in the meridian 
of time, crucified on Calvary's 
cross, resurrected and risen from 
the dead, the Redeemer of man- 
kind, hath made Himself known 
again, and by personal ministry re- 
established His Church in this day, 
with divers gifts, with the visitation 
of angels, with tongues and inter- 
pretation of tongues, with miracles, 
with healings and with all the gifts 
and signs that followed in the wake 
of the ancient apostles. Therefore 
as these things are manifest before 
our eyes, how can we hope to es- 
cape if we neglect so great salva- 
tion? Shall neglect, shall indiffer- 
ence, shall unbelief wean us away 
from the covenants of our fathers 
and mothers, and lulling us to sleep 
in the sense of security, make us 
unmindful of the responsibility 
that rests upon us as children of 
the Most High ? For in such sleep 
we forget God, forget our calling, 
and therefore lose our election and 
reward. 

In the remarks of Elder Orson 
F. Whitney and Joseph F. Smith, 
Jr., in the tabernacle, this morning, 
it was fairly indicated to us that it 
is the unbelieving one who has shut 
himself away from God. Let me 
read the admonition of the Master, 
as recorded in the twentieth chap- 
ter of St. John: After He had 
arisen from the dead and had made 
Himself known to the brethren and 
the faithful saints upon that first 
Lord's day. the Sunday that they 
observed by gathering together to 
partake of the emblems of His 
blood and flesh, and being afraid

of the Jews, had shut themselves 
up into an upper room, when they 
were suddenly visited by the Mas- 
ter. We read that they were af- 
frighted because they thought they 
had seen a spirit, but He said unto 
them, "Peace be unto you," and 
admonished them that it was even 
He Himself, and invited them to 
come forward and thrust their 
hands into His side, and feel the 
prints of the nails in His hands and 
in His feet, which witnessed that 
it was even He Himself and not His 
spirit. They seemed fearful still, 
and evidently did not take advan- 
tage of His invitation. Then He 
asked them if they had any bread 
or meat there, and they brought 
Him a broiled fish and part of a 
honey comb, and He did eat in their 
presence. They bore witness of this 
to Thomas, who was not present 
that day but who was one of the 
chosen disciples. Thomas, as many- 
men today, would not believe the 
testimony of his brethren. He said, 
I will not believe it unless I can 
see and feel the marks of the nails 
in His hands and His feet, and 
when they had come together upon 
the next Sunday, the Master again 
appeared before them, and these 
are the words that are recorded : 

"And after eigth days again his dis- 
ciples were within, and Thomas with 
them. Then came Jesus, the doors 
being shut, and stood in the midst, and 
said Peace be unto you. Then saith 
he to Thomas, Reach hither thy fin- 
ger, and behold my hands, and reach 
hither thy hand, and thrust it into my 
side, and be not faithless but believing." 



Remember this admonition, 
not faithless, but believing." 



'Be 



"And Thomas answered and said 
unto him, My Lord and my God." 

The Master rejoine'd, saying: 



"Thomas, because thou hast seen me 
thou hast believed; blessed are they 
that have not seen, and have be- 
lieved." 

So here again do I read this ad- 
monition, that we ought to be faith- 
ful and not faithless, that we ought 
to be believing and not unbelieving. 
And if you will recall the remarks 
of Elder Smith this morning, you 
remember how he cited the men of 
the world who hold the places of 
prominence as teachers and minis- 
ters for Christ, who do not accept 
the atonement of the Master, who 
do not accept the fact that He is the 
Only Begotten of the Father in the 
flesh, who do not believe we are 
created in His form, but that if we 
are made after Him at all it is in 
reason only that we resemble His 
personality. They question the 
statements of the early fathers of 
the ancient church, the statements 
of the apostles and of the patriarchs 
of old, because they think that in 
this day we have come into more 
learning and knowledge relative to 
the great course of life and the be- 
ing of this world, its creations and 
its environment. 

Let me recite a few words of Col. 
Robert G. Ingersoll. His brother 
Obed was a minister, so called, of 
the gospel of Christ. The colonel 
expected that when death overtook 
him his brother would see to the 
last sad rites, and would speak 
parting words of benediction over 
his body. But his brother died 
early in life, and the Colonel had 
the sad office to fulfill instead for 
his brother. In addressing the peo- 
ple assembled, he likened the life 
of his brother unto that of a beau- 
tiful ship that had set sail under 
most favorable circumstances, 
every sail in place, every rope taut, 
everything in order, so that a most 



100

successful voyage seems propitious, 
when suddenly, without a warning, 
the vessel, struck amidships by .a 
submerged rock, had broken it in 
two, and it drifted out upon the 
waves, driven and tossed by the 
winds, and was scattered to the 
four parts of the earth, never more 
to be brought together again. But 
when he had drawn this picture, 
his own soul within him remon- 
strated with the thought, and he 
expressed these feelings : 

"This life is a narrow vale between 
the cold and barren peaks of two 
eternities. We strive in vain to pierce 
beyond the heights. We cry, and the 
only answer is the echo of our soul: 
he who lies before us, mistaking the 
approach of death for the return of 
health, murmured with his latest 
breath, I am better now." 

And the Colonel concludes : 

"Let us hope in spite of doubt and 
fear, dogmas and tears, that this is so, 
of all the countless dead, for in the 
dark night of death hope sees a star 
and the listening ear catches the 
rustling of a wing." 

A complete contradiction to his 
former statements, "and showing 
that within his heart, as within the 
soul of every man, there is some- 
thing that reaches out after the in- 
finite. He said, "We strive in vain 
to pierce beyond the heights : we 
cry, and the only answer is the 
echo of our wail.'' Now because 
he was faithless ; and lacked faith 
in God and in His work ; — he be- 
lieved not, and therefore he received 
no answer, for we are to walk by 
faith and not by sight. And I take 
it in this scripture that I read to 
you, the Lord Jesus rather re- 
proaches' Thomas than blessing 
him, though happily for Thomas, 
he did confess his Master when his 



eyes beheld Him and his ears heard 
His loved voice; but the Master 
said to him, "Thomas, thou hast be- 
lieved because thou hast seen me. 
Blessed are they who have not seen, 
and yet have believed." And so 
with these modern men who were 
quoted today. So with Colonel In- 
gersoll. Those who are faithless 
and are not believing, do not have 
the testimony of the Christ. The 
Holy Ghost does not come to them 
as a witness for it has not been 
conferred upon them. They have 
not complied with the teachings of 
the Master, wherein He said, "My 
doctrine is not mine, but His that 
sent me, and if any man will do His 
will, he shall know of the doctrine, 
whether I speak of God or whether 
I speak of myself." And that 
promise is to the least of the chil- 
dren of our Father and to the least 
that shall come in the flesh, as well 
as to the great ones of the earth 
who lived with the Master in His 
day. 

So we may not wonder at the 
lack of understanding upon the part 
of those who were regarded as 
wise and prudent after the knowl- 
edge of men, for God has said that 
He had not chosen many rulers 
from among the great and the 
wise ; — but from those who were 
looked upon as insignificant, from 
the meek and the lowly of the earth 
He has raised up witnesses unto 
Him who bear with them such 
earnestness in their testimony that 
men cannot make light of the same, 
no matter if they stumble in their 
language or not. We feel it in their 
very presence, in the clasp of their 
hand. We read it in the light of 
their countenance, and cannot doubt 
the testimony of such men as these, 
to whom God has spoken by the 
voice of His spirit, or unto whom 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



101 



the Holy Ghost has come and borne 
witness of the truth, taking of the 
things of the Father and of the Son 
and revealing them to men. Not 
only the wise men, so called, of the 
world, but, sad to relate, some of 
our own young men, who have a 
little smattering of the knowledge 
of the world, and who have studied 
some of the philosophies of men, 
who are misinformed, and whose 
philosophies are not grounded on 
the truth, have by their specious 
pleading been led to believe, as was 
stated this morning, in evolution 
and in the higher criticism of the 
scriptures. They will tell us that 
the books written are not to be 
ascribed to those whose names fol- 
low as the authors of the works, 
that they are eastern allegories and 
fables and stories, and that they 
are not true histories of the deal- 
ings of Providence anciently nor in 
the meridian of time ; but the de- 
ductions that they make and the 
sophistries that they teach are much 
more difficult to explain, to accept 
and believe than the plain, simple 
statement of the holy scriptures 
themselves. 

An added testimony to the truth 
of these scriptures comes to us in 
the manifestos of some of the great- 
est living scientists, members of the 
Royal Society of Edinburgh, as 
given, I think, but about six years 
since, when unitedly these men de- 
clared that not only the history of 
the Bible and of God's hand-dealing 
with His people was true, but the 
very miracles performed, as stated 
in the New Testament, the turning 
of water into wine, the revivifying 
of the dead, the healing of the 
leper, the unstopping of the ears of 
the deaf, and the opening of the 
eyes of the blind, not only might 
be demonstrated scientifically, but 



were true to the principles of 
higher science. This wisdom and 
knowledge is gleaned in part now 
by men in their blindness ; and these 
very men feel that about us there 
are forces unharnessed as yet to 
serve men's will, — planes upon 
which we do not function, and are 
slow to reject the testimony of men 
of the past and even of the present, 
who say that they do know because 
they have come in touch with this, 
power and are witnesses of the 
hand-dealings of Christ and of the 
visitation of angels and the healing 
of the sick, etc. 

Why, how weak, how impotent 
after all, despite all that man has 
achieved, is man himself. Our poor 
ears, though they have been enrap- 
tured by the melody of song this 
afternoon, so sweetly rendered by 
the combined choirs and by the in- 
strument accompaying them, — our 
poor ears can only interpret and re- 
ceive a very few of the vibrations 
that we call .sound, and between the 
vibrations of sound and sight there 
lies a wondrous field, unheard, un- 
known, unexperienced by mortal 
man, because in our weakness, our 
finiteness, we cannot . function in 
that plane. The sights that might 
be seen, the sounds that might be 
heard, are uninterpreted and unseen 
because we are mortal. But some- 
times God quickens the ear and the 
eye of man, and they hear and see 
things unheard and unseen before. 
And so the poets have declared that 

"Ever near us though unseen, 
The dear immortal spirits tread, 

And all the universe is life; 
There is no dead." 

Ofttimes in rejecting so great 
salvation, we do it by looking back 
mournfully, as was stated this 
morning, into the past, by thinking 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of things that might have been, by 
weeping over time and conditions 
and .opportunities, perchance, that 
cannot come again, or that we lose 
because we look to the past and do 
not take heed of the present and 
look for the future. Ofttimes too 
there may be dreamers who are liv- 
ing in the future, who have buikled 
up for themselves an ethereal ex- 
istence that is not real, and because 
it is unreal is unhealthy. I have 
met people who think that they are 
so saintly that if they can retain 
certain divine thoughts, they shall 
never die, that they shall not taste 
of death, that they arrest the seeds 
of dissolution, and cannot even 
grow old. I have seen them not 
only grow decrepit and old, but die 
since they first announced this doc- 
trine to me in the mission field. 
Such creatures and dreamers of the 
future — and men who look mourn- 
fully to the past, and put off the 
issues of the present for the future, 
crucify today between, the thieves 
of yesterday and tomorrow the op- 
portunities for salvation gained 
only by living godly in Christ Jesus 
today. 

I admonish you Latter-day Saints 
to see to it that so far as you are 
concerned, complying with the doc- 
trines of Christ you shall set in your 
hearts and in the hearts of your 
children such love of truth, such a 
testimony of the Christ, that you 
will not be led astray by the spe- 
cious pleading of so called learned 
men, but in the effulgent sun of 
revelation you will be able to say, 
as did Peter, that "Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God ;" 
that with one of the ancient proph- 
ets you can say, "as for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." If 
tried, if tormented, if perplexed 
with griefs and fears, if there be 



obstacles in your pathway that you 
feel that you cannot surmount, if 
broken-hearted because loved ones 
have been wrested from you, or 
wantonly have gone astray, still be 
like Job, who could sit down in the 
ashes of his once happy home and 
declare, "though he slay me yet 
will I trust him," "for I know that 
my Redeemer liveth, and that he 
shall stand at the latter-day upon 
the earth ; and though after my skin 
worms destroy this body, yet in my 
flesh shall I see God, whom I shall 
see for myself and mine eyes shall 
behold, and not another, though my 
reins be consumed within me." 
That is the faith that surmounts 
the doubts and the difficulties of to- 
day; that is the faith that will en- 
able you to surmount every ob- 
stacle; that is the faith that will 
help you to recognize the hand of 
God in all of His hand-dealings, 
and meet meekly chastisement when 
it shall come from His beneficent 
hand. "Be not faithless, but be- 
lieving, for blessed are they who 
have not seen and yet have be- 
lieved." 

May the peace of our Father be 
with you, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

I am very happy, my brethren 
and sisters, for the opportunity of 
attending conference this spring. I 
think that the opportunity to meet 
here with the Latter-day Saints and 
mingle with them, and shake the 
hands of friends, of brethren and 
sisters, is one of the great pleasures 
of life, and I appreciate it very 
much. My experience in attending 
these conferences has always been 
a source of joy to me from the very

beginning. I have learned to love 
my fellow men and enjoy the asso- 
ciation of friends. I have never 
seen a crowd too big, or too many 
people, and I find happiness and 
great pleasure, when I can asso- 
ciate with men who bear the priest- 
hood of God and who are true to 
life. We find this condition among 
the Latter-day Saints to a greater 
degree than it is in the world among 
any other body of people. 

I appreciate the power of the 
priesthood. I have been thinking 
during this conference most seri- 
ously that I ought to be very care- 
ful with the testimony which I have 
received, and guard it as a precious 
gift. Above all other gifts is a tes- 
timony of this gospel, that God 
lives and that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet sent 
from God to live in this dispensa- 
tion, and to bear testimony unto 
men with such power that the 
Lord's work would be firmly estab- 
lished. It is a precious gift to you, 
my brethren and sisters ; it is worth 
more than anything else ; I want to 
guard mine more carefully in the 
future than T have ever done in the 
past. 

The testimony of Jesus is the 
spirit of prophecy. Men who have 
not the testimony of Jesus do not 
believe in prophecy and in revela- 
tion. Hence we are not surprised 
at all to hear them say there is no 
such thing as an authorized priest 
in the earth, no such thing as a tem- 
ple of God in the earth, no need of 
them any more. I attended a 
church in one of the Southern 
states a few weeks ago, between 
trains, when I was visiting the 
elders in the Central States mis- 
sion. I had two or three hours to 
wait, so T went into one of the 



churches. They were in session 
that evening, with a large number 
of people present. The minister 
made the statement that I have 
mentioned, that there was not a 
priest upon the earth, that there 
was no need of a temple in the 
earth; Christ had performed the 
work for all of us, and if we ad- 
mitted Christ we were sure of sal- 
vation. He did not believe in reve- 
lation at all, said it was unneces- 
sary. He did not believe in proph- 
ecy, and I was not surprised, for I 
knew the Apostle John had said 
that "the testimony of Jesus is the 
spirit of prophecy." Men who have 
not the testimony of Jesus are not 
in a position to state or to say that 
there are prophets in the earth, and 
that revelation does exist. They 
have not learned that much. And 
so I was not surprised when I heard 
him make this statement ; but re- 
membered at the moment the words 
of Paul, when he spoke along the 
same line, "that no man can say 
that Jesus is the Lord but by the 
Holy Ghost" (1 Cor. 12:3). I re- 
membered how the apostles preach- 
ed that the Holy Ghost would be 
received. On the day of Pentecost, 
when the people, touched in their 
hearts, asked, "Men and brethren 
what shall we do?" Peter said unto 
them, "Repent and be baptized, 
every one of you in the name of 
Jesus Christ, for the remission of 
sins, and ye shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts 2:37, 
38). He thus followed an order 
that had been outlined by the 
Christ, who labored with Peter and 
those apostles. Jesus said, "My 
doctrine is not mine but His that 
sent me." He never claimed it as 
His, but He claimed it as His 
Father's, that He had sent Him into 
the world to preach the gospel and

declare unto the children of men the 
words of life, the words that would 
give unto them the testimony that 
Job gave us, which has been so 
beautifully repeated here this after- 
noon. 

There is no salvation, no eternal 
life, outside of the gospel. There 
is only ohe way by which men can 
be saved, according to Paul wherein 
he states, "One Lord, one faith, one 
baptism" (Eph. 4:5). No matter 
how well a man may be read in the 
scripture, — and that gentleman that 
1 listened to that evening was well 
read ; in his letters he was perfect — 
unless his mind is illumined by the 
Spirit he cannot comprehend the 
Truth. I remembered, as he spoke, 
the words of the apostle that "the 
letter killeth but the Spirit giveth 
life" (11 Cor. 3:6). He was not 
able to understand the gospel, for 
as one of the former prophets 
stated, according to the scripture, 
"Where there is no vision the peo- 
ple perish." Where the visions are 
closed, the Lord does not reveal 
Himself ; then the people perish in 
unbelief, and they do not know the 
Lord, they have not the testimony 
of Jesus, they are unable to stand 
up and truthfully say, "I know that 
God lives, I know that Jesus is the 
Savior of the world." They are not 
in possession of that knowledge, for 
that comes only in one way, through 
revelation from God unto His ser- 
vants the prophets, for it is said, 
that "surely the -Lord God will do 
nothing but he revealeth his secret 
unto his servants the prophets" 
(Amos 3:7). My mind went to a 
revelation of the Lord here, that we 
are all acquainted with, recorded in 
the Doctrine and Covenants, 13th 
chapter. I should have liked to 
have had the opportunity of read- 
ing it to that gentleman that even- 



ing. I did not want to engage in a 
debate with him ; I did not want to 
engage in anything that bordered on 
contention, for contention does not 
carry with it the Spirit of the Lord ; 
but I should liked to have read 
to him the truth that the Lord has 
revealed from heaven, the priest- 
hood of God, the power that our 
Father delegated to man upon the 
earth. It was revealed through 
John and later through Peter, 
James, and John. Section 13 reads 
as follows : 

"Words of the angel, John (the 
Baptist), spoken to Joseph Smith, Jr., 
and Oliver Cowdery as he laid his 
hands upon their heads and ordained 
them to the Aaronic priesthood, in 
Harmony, Susquehannah County, 
Pensylvania, May IS, 1829: 'Upon 
you, my fellow servants, in the name 
of Messiah, I confer the priesthood 
of Aaron, which holds the keys of the 
ministering of angels, and of the gos- 
pel of repentance, and of baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, 
and this shall never be taken from 
the earth until the sons of Levi do 
offer again an offering unto the Lord 
in righteousness.' " 

Whether that minister stated that 
the priesthood was not in the earth 
or not, it makes no difference ; he 
never knew. But it was and is in 
the earth, and I should like to have 
had the opportunity of reading the 
revelation of the Lord upon it. for 
after all there are thousands of men 
and women in the earth who are 
ready to receive the eospel. Thev 
are a little afraid of "Mormonism." 
because "Mormonism" and polye- 
amv are regarded as synonymous 
in the world, and they take snao 
iudgfment and are not informed. 
Thev do not understand the gosoel. 
Thev do not know why we have, at 
one period of the Church's historv. 
preached polygamv. We believe in 
revelation from God : we believe in

a restoration of the gospel, not in a 
"reformation," and with the resto- 
ration there was revelated a prin- 
ciple which Abraham practiced and 
believed in — that Abraham of 
whom the Lord said, that through 
him and his seed all the nations of 
the earth should be blessed. That 
principle was restored and obeyed 
to a limited extent, under most try- 
ing circumstances, by men and 
women of great faith and integrity. 
The time came when it was taken 
away ; but it had been restored, and 
it has left its history. No better 
men can be found in all the world 
than those who came through that 
lineage. 

In this connection I remember 
the words of Jesus in the gospel of 
St. Luke, when he said unto the peo- 
ple that they should see Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of 
God, and all the holy prophets, and 
they themselves should be thrust 
out ; there would be weeping and 
wailing and gnashing of teeth. I 
want to tell you, if Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob and those holy prophets 
did not forfeit their rights, neither 
did the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
Brigham Young and others who 
conscientiously accepted and lived 
that principle. Had it not been in- 
cluded in "Mormon" doctrine, I sup- 
pose our opponents could have cen- 
sured us for not believing in it, for 
they could have produced abundant 
evidence in its favor from the an- 
cient scriptures. However, I allude 
to this matter only incidentally and 
without the slightest intention to ad- 
vocate the doctrine now, because as 
you all know, its practice has ceased 
among us by commandment of God, 
in order that another law — the law 
of the land — might be obeyed. And 
that is the situation today. Never- 
theless the world will yet become 



acquainted with the true nature of 
our belief and discover that w,e did 
keep God's commandments; an 1 
they will learn that "Mormonism" 
is the biggest and the greatest thing 
in the world, and the testimony of 
it is the greatest thing that one can 
possibly have. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
you. I see the time is going, and 
there are a number of others to 
speak. I take a delight in bearing my 
testimony for I have one. I know 
that the Lord lives and rules in 
the earth and in the heavens above, 
and that He has servants to admin- 
ister unto the children of men. I 
know that this is His work, and that 
He has established it never more to 
be given to another people, never to 
be re-organized, but to continue or- 
ganized as it was in the days of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith ; and it shall 
remain here until Christ comes to 
take His place upon the earth at its 
head. The Lord bless you. Amen.

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President Western States Mission.) 

A few weeks ago, Prof. Harvey 
A. Overstreet, of the College of the 
City of New York, speaking to a 
convention of ministers of one of 
the great Christian churches, at 
Pittsburgh, said substantially as 
follows : 

"The time is ripe for the formula- 
tion of a new religion. Much that is 
peculiar of the period of today is also 
peculiar of the Alexandrian period, 
when Christianity had its birth. To- 
day sees great cults arising. There 
are great social upheavals. It is a 
great age of ferment. I sometimes 
think that out of this vast social cal- 
dron will come some new thing. Tt 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



seems we can believe this; that the 
accredited religions institutionalized 
as they are, have been failures. We 
find the attitude towards the church 
is rather lukewarm. The accredited 
religions are not the great soul-inspir- 
ing, encompassing things they ought 
to be. The new religion will come out 
of the midst of those groups which 
have accepted the scientific, demo- 
cratic and social point of view." 

1 wondered, as I read the dis- 
patch accredited to this educator, if 
he had familiarized himself with all 
of the religions of the day before 
making the statement attributed to 
him, for it would seem that there is 
one rather widely known creed 
which might cover the vital features 
demanded by the gentleman in the 
new religion he is looking for. That 
religion I do not hesitate to say is 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Let us see how the 
Church would line up by compar- 
ison. The theology of "Mormon- 
ism" is in harmony with science, or 
better stated, the conclusions of 
some of the greatest scientific minds 
have been made to harmonize with 
much that has been set forth as 
"Mormon" teaching. When that 
religion was founded there was 
need, apparently, for some new 
thing, because there was much 
lacking in the confessed creeds of 
the various religions. For instance, 
most of them professed a belief 
that God was an incorporeal im- 
material Being, without body, parts 
or passions. They professed also 
that the world was created, literally 
created, out of nothing, and like- 
wise that man also was literally 
created, and that he was pre- 
destined to either a glorious salva- 
tion or eternal damnation, and that 
no act of his could change the plan 
of his life. 



With the teachings of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, these im- 
possible ideas were set aside, for he 
testified that God and Jesus Christ 
were separate and distinct beings, 
corporeal beings, that they visited 
him in vision the most remarkable 
of modern times, or for all time 
perhaps of which we have record, 
when he talked face to face with 
them, and received instructions re- 
garding the contemplated work to 
be established in the world for the 
last time, the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
It is also a cardinal teaching in 
"Mormonism" that matter is eter- 
nal, and that the object had by the 
Almighty in forming the world was 
to bring together the various forces 
that were already here, and that 
matter, while altered, could not be 
destroyed, i. e., annihilated. As re- 
specting man, it is confidently as- 
serted that he was born into the 
world of mortality through the plan 
of the Almighty, and that the in- 
telligence of man is also eternal, — 
is in fact co-eternal with God. Some 
advanced thoughts as regards as- 
tronomy were also made known, 
which science has since recognized. 
From the standpoint of democracy 
in religion we can pass muster 
surely for a revelation was received 
in 1830, but three months after the 
organization of the Church as fol- 
lows : "And all things shall be 
done by common consent in the 
Church by much prayer and faith 
for all things you shall receive by 
faith." That rule has obtained and 
still maintains in the Church. Can- 
didates for the priesthood must be 
approved by the voice of the people. 
Stake and ward authorities are pre- 
sented to be voted upon and this 
great conference has set its seal of 
approval by vote upon the General 
Authorities, and similar action is

also taken throughout the stakes at 
each quarterly conference. 

As to the social point of view. 
We are given credit for having 
solved most satisfactorily the most 
important problems, by those who 
have impartially investigated our 
conditions. Thomas M. Bicknell, a 
former president of the National 
Education Association and promi- 
nent educator of New England, 
writes as follows : 

"The 'Mormon' polity, on the side 
of social order, is recognized as the 
most thoroughly organized sytem in 
the world. Every intelligent man 
should study it for its recognition of 
the solution of economic health and 
social problems. Its details of super- 
vision are exact, thorough-g-oing and 
efficient. 

"Beyond and above all in perfection 
of system and in the realization of 
grand results, are the industry, fru- 
gality and temperance of the people. 
The beehive properly symbolizes the 
spirit and practice of the 'Mormons.' 
Go where you will, you will find no 
poverty, while wealth abounds in 
practical abundance. Homes are full 
of comforts and luxuries; art, music 
and literature are the endowments of 
all. The wealth of the land has at- 
tracted the 'Mormons' more than the 
wealth of the mines, and both are 
making wealth common and fairly 
distributed. 

"Utah is a rich land of great possi- 
bilities. Its richest possession is its 
'Mormon' population of honest, pure- 
minded, sweet-hearted men, women 
and children who have drawn on 
Nature's forces for her grateful ser- 
vices and returns. They have, out of 
the lion's mouth, plucked the honey- 
comb of sweet content and honest 
life, and were the Master to walk the 
streets of Salt Lake City today, would 
he not say to all critics and detractors 
of 'Mormonism:' 'Let him that is 
without sin cast the first stone'?" 

We are judged by the world be- 
cause they know little of the teach- 
ings of professed "Mormonism." 
Only last fall, while making a tour 



of the South, the Vice-President of 
the United States, Thomas R. Mar- 
shall, was quoted in the dispatches 
from Phoenix, Arizona, in speak- 
ing of Efficiency, as follows : 

"We want to be an efficient people, 
but we want to be also a free people. 
We cannot be both. The German na- 
tion and the 'Mormon' Church are the 
two greatest organizations in the 
world, but in each the individual is 
subservient to the organization. What 
we want is efficiency, but we also want 
freedom with it." 

I think one might well agree with 
him in the statement regarding the 
German nation, and without saying 
anything derogatory of them as a 
people it is pretty generally con- 
ceded that they have been subserv- 
ient to the powers that rule them. 
But we do take issue with him when 
he undertakes to say that men and 
women comprising this Church are 
subservient to men. The strength 
of the "Mormon" Church lies in the 
individual testimony of its mem- 
bers, because they know the truth, 
and yet we honor and respect the 
priesthood, and the great and good 
men at the head of the Church. We 
love them, and cherish them, and 
would lay down our lives for them, 
if need be; yet we do not worship 
them. We worship God and Jesus 
Christ. 

As we view the great mission of 
the Church, there looms before me 
this question, how are we individ- 
ually shaping our lives to advance 
that great work? Are we ready to 
go on missions and labor to advance 
God's purposes in the world? Are 
we prepared to sacrifice when the 
times comes to that end ? Is our 
example to the world such as we 
would have it to be, and since we 
are said to be one of the greatest 
organizations in the world today, 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



by those who stand high in the 
councils of the world, then we 
ought to be ready to say: I will 
dedicate my life, or a portion of it, 
to- the end that God's purposes may 
be magnified in the earth, and that 
this Church may also be magnified 
commensurate to the claims we 
make. 

I call upon you returned mission- 
aries, men and women, with all the 
fervor of my soul, as I called upon 
the missionaries of the Western 
States last night, in our reunion, to 
carry with you and keep with you 
as you return to your homes the 
spirit of the mission field; seek to 
be engaged in the work of the Lord, 
and be ready for any call that is 
made upon you, and endeavor to 
carry throughout the Church the 
spirit that you had in the mission 
field, for we at home have not all 
of us that inspiration ; many have 
not the power and influence that 
you had in the mission field, to keep 
young men and young women from 
going astray, as well as to keep 
yourselves free from sin. We have 
much to fear, let me tell you, from 
the powers of the Adversary, for 
they are at work in Zion as well as 
abroad in the earth. 

As I view sometimes the magni- 
tude of this work and what 1 hum- 
bly hope to do, I recall the lines of 
a poet, when he said : 

"If you could know that half of all I 
yearn to be to you, dear heart! 

Each day that dawns I struggle to be 
strong and do my part, 

Yet when at last the night comes 
softly down I humbly pray, 

'Lord, grant me still to prove my ten- 
der love just one more day!' 

"Just one more day to strive to rise 
above small troubles, petty care, 

That my cramped soul may break its 
earth-forged bonds, at last to dare 



To face the future and to gladly live 

with courage new, 
Loyal and cheerful facing toward the 

light for truth and you. 

"And yet I feel in spite of all the 

heights which I can never scale, 
In spite of all the many tests in which 

I daily fail, 
That my deep love, more deep and 

pure and strong than I can ever show, 
You somehow, through my failures, 

doubts and fears, will come to know. 

"The dreary clouds can't hide the sun 
for aye; it glimmers through. 

The sweet, wet violet, struggling 
through dead leaves, still shows its blue. 

And so I trust, though oft I strike 
love's chord with clumsy hand. 

You'll feel the melody I tried to play 
and understand." 

May God's blessing be with us to 
guide and keep us in the way of life 
and truth, I pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Softly 
beams the sacred dawning." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President Southern States Mission.) 

Sacred thoughts fill my heart as 
I face this congregation, because I 
know that all of you have made 
great sacrifices for the preaching of 
the gospel and the establishment of 
the kingdom of God in the earth. 
But you have embraced the truth 
and the faith which connects your 
souls with God, and you walk in 
the comfort of the Holy Ghost. 

In the Book of Mormon is this 
prophecy: "And blessed are they 
who shall seek to bring forth my 
Zion at that day, for they shall have 
the gift and the power of the Holy 
Ghost." Bearing in mind that 
among the choicest gifts of the 
Holy Ghost is the gift of prophecy, 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



109 



let us examine this prophecy for a 
moment or two and see whether it 
has been fulfilled. When the 
Prophet Joseph translated the Book 
of Mormon he was only 25 years 
old. The Church had not been or- 
ganized, but God did fulfill that 
prophecy by the mouth of His Holy 
Prophets, who spoke as they were 
moved by the Holy Ghost. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith, by the gift 
and power of revelation predicted 
the great Civil War which raged in 
ferocity and fearfulness for a num- 
ber of years. He predicted that the 
war would terminate in the death 
and misery of many souls. When 
war was declared the people of the 
South thought that the bravery and 
the valor of their soldiers would 
end the war in a few months, and 
that great patriot Abraham Lincoln 
himself believed that a few months 
would terminate the struggle. One 
of our brethren in the South, who 
was appointed to a command in the 
Confederate army, in addressing 
his men before they went to war, 
said : "Boys, do not delude your- 
selves ; this is going to be a long 
and a bloody war." They said, 
"How do you know?" "Because," 
said he, "I am a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, and 
he predicted that this war would 
terminate in the death and the 
misery of many souls." Did Joseph 
Smith have the gift of the power of 
thf Holy Ghost? Consult the an- 
nals of our great republic. Shake- 
speare declares there are sermons 
in stones. The monuments erected 
in the North and in the South to 
commemorate the valor and the 
heroism of the bovs in blue and the 
boys that wore the gray are elo- 
quent sermons in stones that Joseph 



Smith did speak by the gift and the 
power of the Holy Ghost. 

In that same revelation on war, 
it is predicted that after this war 
between the North and the South, 
then war would be poured out upon 
all nations. Behold the deadly war 
in Europe. Listen to the bursting 
of the bombs, the roar of the can- 
non, the groans of the dying, the 
moans from the mothers' anguish- 
stricken hearts, and then tell me if 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. The Latter-day Saints do not 
as a people pray for the victory of 
one wavering nation over another 
wavering nation. I will tell you 
what they pray for, they pray that 
the nations of the earth that are at 
war may lose their lust for con- 
quest, may stifle their greed for 
gain ; and they also pray that these 
nations may seek God for that 
choice gift which cometh from 
Him, even the gift of repentance. 

Isaiah, the prophet, declared : 
"When thy judgments are in the 
earth, the inhabitants of the world 
will learn righteousness," and O 
may God grant that these warring 
nations may forsake their stubborn- 
ness of heart. We pray that they 
will have a change of heart, that 
they may pray with David : "Create 
in me a clean heart, O God, and re- 
new a right spirit within me. Cast 
me not away from thy presence, 
and take not thy Holy Spirit from 
me. Restore unto me the joy of thy 
salvation, and uphold me with thy 
free Spirit." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
the mission of this Church is to 
preach the gospel, to awaken in the 
hearts of men and women the spirit 
of repentance. Indeed, so impor- 
tant is this, that Cod has said : "Say 
nothing but repentance unto this 
generation." The gospel is "God's

last warning" to men, and your sons 
and your daughters are boldly, 
bravely and grandly proclaiming 
the mission to bring to pass the 
purposes of God. 

Recently a minister said, "The 
description of the Millennium plain- 
ly indicates a revival of the pure 
faith and practice of primitive 
Christianity." "It is to be remem- 
bered," says this minister, "that the 
protestant reformation did not 
effect this. During the millennium 
period these will be brought back to 
their best estate, and become domi- 
nant, and this state of things will 
continue during the thousand 
years." It is our testimony, which 
we are bearing to the nations of the 
earth, that this primitive gospel hath 
been restored to the earth, and with 
it has been restored the holy priest- 
hood, which is the power and au- 
thority to minister in the things per- 
taining to the Almighty. Jesus 
said : "And this gospel of the king- 
dom shall be preached in all the 
world as a witness unto all nations, 
and then shall the end come." 
Among many nations are heard the 
voices of your noble sons and 
(laughters, approved of God, choice 
young men and young women, cry- 
ing "Repent for the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand." 

May God grant that the nations 
of the earth may not be compelled 
much longer to learn righteousness, 
to learn repentance, but may they 
turn to their God with repentant 
hearts and renewed spirits, and ac- 
cept the everlasting gospel, be bap- 
tized without stubbornness of heart, 
and with you and me rejoice in the 
blessings of the everlasting gospel, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Convincing character of testimony 
borne by the Saints — Man should 
follow Nature's example of obedi- 
ence to law. 

My dear brethren and sisters, if 
President Joseph F. Smith were in 
attendance at this concluding meet- 
ing of the conference, we might 
reasonably expect that he would 
leave his benediction with us, as 
that is his custom, and I know that 
many of the Saints look forward 
with keen anticipation of the priv- 
ilege of attending the last session of 
the conference, in the tabernacle, 
that they may hear his words and 
receive his blessing. Some of you, 
no doubt, feel very much disap- 
pointed at not having this privilege 
today. Therefore, as a representa- 
tive of President Joseph F. Smith 
and of the Lord, and by the author- 
ity of the Holy Priesthood, I bless 
you, my brethren and sisters. May 
God's choicest blessings attend you 
in the future as in the past, and even 
more abundantly, thus rewarding 
you for all your faithfulness and in- 
tegrity in serving Him. 

The testimonies to which you 
have listened this afternoon have 
been inspired by the Spirit of the 
Lord, those who have spoken have 
done so as the oracles of God. Their 
testimonies and instructions will be 
published to the world, and shall 
stand as a witness against those 
who, hearing or reading these testi- 
monies, shall reject them. To see 
both the Tabernacle and Assembly 
Hall filled to overflowing, and at 
the same time great throngs of peo- 
ple out on the Temple grounds must 
impress the thoughtful of those who 
are not of us, with the devotion of 
the Latter-clav Saints to their re- 



ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS. 



Ill 



ligion. I thank the Lord that I am 
identified with this great work, and 
have fellowship with you, members 
of His Church. The Latter-day 
Saints are, perhaps, more than any 
other religionists, convinced and 
sure of the correctness of their re- 
ligious attitude before the world; 
this is evident in the strength of 
their testimonies. Can anyone who 
has heard these elders speak this af- 
ternoon doubt their sincerity or the 
assurance they have of the truth of 
their own statements ? 

The Latter-day Saints have un- 
stinted faith in God ; they do not 
undertake, in any degree, to abridge 
His knowledge, His power, or His 
authority. While we regard Him 
as a man perfected, we accept liter- 
ally the scriptural declaration, "The 
Lord made heaven and earth, the 
sea and all that in them is." All His 
creations are governed by laws of 
His own making, and, excepting 
man, all His creations are obedient 
to His laws ; hence the order every- 
where throughout the universe. If 
these inanimate creations were as 
disobedient to laws made for their 
government as is man to laws made 
for his government, there would be 
universal confusion and chaos. On 
the other hand, if man were as obe- 
dient in his sphere as the heavenly 
bodies are in theirs, there would be 
like harmony and order, with peace 
on earth and good will towards men 
everywhere. If man's disobedience 
then is apparent, as also its baneful 
effects, what is the lesson we should 
learn by it ? As for the Latter-day 
Saints, we know better than we do. 
and have need of being impressed 
with the necessity for doing as well 
as we know. The poet, Waldo Em- 
erson, felt this same weakness and 
expressed it in terms as follows : 
"What I most need is somebody to 



make me do as well as 1 can." The 
Apostle James declared unto the 
people of his time : "Wherefore, lay 
apart all filthiness and superfluity 
of naughtiness, and receive with 
meekness the engrafted word, which 
is able to save your souls, but be ye 
doers of the word, and not hearers 
only, deceiving your own selves." 
When the Savior was concluding 
His sermon upon the Mount He 
seemed to have in mind man's fail- 
ing and took occasion to leave this 
admonition as the climax of His 
sermon : 

•'Therefore whosoever heaieui these 
sayings of mine, and doe-h them, 1 
will liken him unto a wise man which 
built his house upon a rock; and the 
rain descended, and the floods came, 
and the winds blew and beat upon that 
house, and it fell not: for it was 
founded upon a rock. And every one 
that heareth these sayings of mine, 
and doeth them not, shall be likened 
unto a foolish man, which built his 
house upon the sand: and the rains de- 
scended, and the floods came, and the 
winds blew and beat upon that house, 
and it fell, and great was the fall of it." 

It is one thing to give intellectual 
assent unto the commandments of 
the Lord, and another to obey the 
same. It is the obedience that 
counts for righteousness and for 
salvation. Obedience is the lesson 
we need to learn. This lesson 
learned, as the Lord would have the 
Latter-day Saints to learn the les- 
son of obedience, and the first sug- 
gestion from the presiding authori- 
ties of the Church that we do not 
indulge in card playing, immodest 
dancing, immodest dressing, etc., 
would be sufficient. We sing, "We 
thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
to guide us in these latter days," 
and then in many instances refuse 
to be so guided. This is displeas- 
ing to the Lord, as well as being 
hurtful to the individual.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prejudice in the minds of people 
who have been misinformed in re- 
lation to the Latter-day Saints and 
their religion, is a great barrier in 
the way of such people receiving 
the message of the Gospel which we 
have for the world. If our lives 
were consistent with our profession 
of faith, it would go a long way to- 
ward removing this prejudice and 
preparing the way for effective 
sowing of the seeds of truth, to the 
honor and glory of the Lord and 
the salvation of His children. 

May the Lord bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and may His 
peace be upon Zion and her people, 
and upon all the earth, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The anthem, "Praise ye the Fath- 
er," was sung by the combined 
choirs. 

The closing prayer was by Elder 
William C. Parkinson. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 2 
p. m. ; Elder George iUbert Smith 
presided, and the male choir of the 
Salt Lake L. D. S. U. furnished 
choral selections, under the lead- 
ership of B. Cecil Gates. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "How firm a foundation." 

Prayer was offered by Bishop 
Moses H. Pond. 

The male choir sang the anthem, 
"O Death, where is thy sting?" 

ELDER JOHN R. YOUNG. 

(Of San Juan Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, and 
friends who may be present here 
today, I feel very weak' and humble 



in standing before you, and I do not 
know whether I will be able to con- 
trol my feelings so as to speak to 
you or not; but there is a prayer in 
my heart, that God will bless me, 
and strengthen me, that I may be 
able, for the few minutes that I 
shall stand before you, to say some 
things that shall be comforting, and 
I trust, interesting to us as Latter- 
day Saints. 

I feel very grateful in my heart 
that I was born of parents who had 
received a testimony of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; and I feel very thankful to 
my parents for the examples that 
they always placed before me. My 
father was a man who believed in 
prayer. My mother was a Christian 
woman, she always called her chil- 
dren about her and had them kneel 
in her presence, and thank God for 
His mercies to them, every day be- 
fore they lay down to sleep. I thank 
my mother for these lessons. 

I have had the privilege of going 
out into the world, away from our 
people. I was called when I was 
a boy of sixteen, to go into the mis- 
sion field to proclaim t-he Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ to the chil- 
dren of men. I can recall how 
feeble and weak I was, and I thank 
the Christian world for the charity 
that they had toward me when I 
was but a child, trying to labor 
among them. I had them often ask 
me why I was a Latter-day Saint. 
I suppose that my replies to that 
seemed simple and childish to them, 
but my statements were honest and 
truthful. 

In the early years of my life I 
remember meeting the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I was a sickly child ; 
had suffered for two weeks, per- 
haps, with the chills and fever. I 
was a little skeleton, and peevish. 



ELDER JOHN R. YOUNG.

everything would annoy me. I re- 
member that one morning my father 
had led me out to give me a little 
sunshine, and in that walk we met 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, his 
brother Hyrum, and Sidney Rig- 
don. When they met my father, 
they shook hands with him, and the 
Prophet asked father if I was the 
little boy that father had requested 
the Elders to pray for. Now, the 
Latter-day Saints were a praying 
people; they had faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and that faith was 
strengthened in their bosoms by the 
testimonies of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; and on that occasion, when 
we met them, I knew the Prophet. 
I had seen him in the congregations 
of the Saints, and I knew that he 
was a man that our people honored 
and loved ; and hence I felt a thrill 
of pleasure pass over my little 
frame when he paid some little at- 
tention to me. When my father 
had told him that I was the child he 
had requested the Elders to pray 
for, the Prophet stepped toward me, 
and took my little straw hat from 
my head. He ran his fingers 
through my curly hair, and for the 
moment it seemed to me that he was 
looking far away, and then he said 
to father, "Brother Young, don't 
you worry about this little man, he 
will live to grow up to manhood, 
and will help carry this gospel to 
the nations of the earth." That is 
one of my strongest and earliest 
recollections of things that came to 
me in this life, and hence I have 
answered to those who have met me 
out in the world, and asked me why 
1 was a Latter-day Saint, that from 
my childhood, lessons came to me 
that gave me faith in the prophet of 
the last days, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

I also recall the martyrdom of the 



Prophets Joseph and Hyrum. My 
father was away from home, in the 
state of Ohio, doing missionary 
work at the time of the martyrdom. 
When he returned home, he said to 
the family, when they w^ere gath- 
ered around the table, "Just as long 
as Brother Brigham is faithful to 
the trust that is placed upon him, 
they will seek for his blood." I 
wondered, though a child, why that 
should be, but the experiences of 
my life have shown me that feel- 
ings of that kind are natural to the 
wicked. As I matured in years, so 
that I could read and begin to grasp 
what I read, I learned that persecu- 
tion was the common heritage of 
every man that has been called of 
God and given a mission to the hu- 
man family. 

As I have stated, I was called 
when a boy of sixteen, to go out 
and teach the gospel to the children 
of men. My mission was to the 
Pacific Islands, the Islands of Ha- 
waii. When I reached there, I was 
assigned to labor on the island of 
Oahu. I will tell you a little of my 
personal experiences. I can hardly 
go beyond that in my talking to you. 
I was placed in a native family, a 
man by the name of Kyama, and 
his wife, no children in the family. 
They two promised to take care of 
me, and give me a home with them 
while I should study their language. 
About one week after my arrival 
there, a native woman, one of the 
neighbors, died. The natives in- 
dulged in considerable and extreme 
mourning over her. I was curious 
to see the manner of interment, and 
I went to the home. I saw them 
wrap the body in carpets and sew 
it up in mats, and carry it to the 
grave. At the graveyard, we met 
the minister of that parish, a ven- 
erable looking man, in appearance 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



very much like our Brother Orson 
Pratt. I admired the man when I 
first saw him, on account of his re- 
semblance to Orson Pratt, whom I 
loved. I went straight up to that 
minister of the gospel and offered 
him my hand, and told him who I 
was. I feared no man on earth at 
that time. I had injured no one, 
and felt kindly toward everybody ; 
I wanted to do men good, that was 
the desire of my heart. I saw the 
minister draw Kyama to one side, 
and talk sharp to him ; and when I 
returned to the cottage that was to 
be my home there was no one there. 
For three days and nights I stayed 
there, without food. T felt indig- 
nant at the treatment that was given 
to me, I could not tell why it was, 
and I turned to leave. 

I took my little carpet sack, and 
started walking back to Honolulu, 
about forty miles. When I came to 
the creek that flows about a mile 
south of the village I stopped and 
asked myself, "What are you going 
to do?" ' 

Let me go a little further back, 
because there may be parents here 
of sons that are out in the mission 
field, or may be called into the mis- 
sion field, and I want to bear my 
testimony that God never forsakes 
those who trust Him. Now, Presi- 
dent Brigham Young had spoken 
to me, when I was called upon that 
mission, and I told him frankly and 
honestly that I did not know "Mor- 
monism" to be true, "I know that 
you do not know it to be true. That 
is one reason we want you to go on 
this mission. And T will make you 
a promise, if you will go on this 
mission and live close to the Lord, 
and not commit sin, I promise you 
that when you come home you will 
take me by the hand and look me 
straight in the face, and tell me 



that you know 'Mormonism' is true. 
\ T ow, will you go ?" I accepted the 
mission. 

When I stood at the bridge, I 
questioned myself, ''What are you 
going to do ? Go back to Honolulu 
and tell the President of the mis- 
sion that you have not sand in your 
crop so that you can stand a little 
hunger and a little unpleasantness? 
And when you tell him that, per- 
haps he will chide you for that. 
Then what? I will not be chicled, 
I have done no man wrong-, and I 
will not be chided, I will go home."' 
But I thought a little, and then felt 
ashamed of myself, and turned 
aside, and went up the creek until 
1 found a grove .of timber, and I 
slipped into that grove and knelt 
down and prayed, and while I 
prayed, that cloud of ill feeling 
passed from me, and there was 
rather a gleam of joy that came to 
me, and I retraced my steps back 
to the bridge. As I came back to 
the bridge a native man came also, 
leading a little burro with a load 
of oranges on his back. The burro 
was overloaded, his little back bent 
('own until the bundle of oranges 
almost touched the ground, it was 
almost all he could do to carry his 
burden. The native had a rope tied 
to a ring in the donkey's nose, lead- 
ing him. Across the bridge going 
northward there was a sharp, rocky 
hill, and when he reached the foot 
of that hill the dunkey stopped 
there. The man held the rope in 
his left hand, and with his right he 
commenced stoning the little burro, 
and swearing in English at him. I 
set my little carpet bag down and 
went to the man and said, "Stop 
stoning that burro, that is cruel, you 
must not do it. And why do you 
swear at him?" And he said, "Don't 
all white men swear when things

115 



won't do what they want them to 
do?" I replied, "No, it is only bad 
white men that swear. I would like 
to see you get the burro up the hill 
without swearing at him and ston- 
ing him; give me the rope." He 
handed me the rope, and I went to 
the side of the road and pulled a 
little grass, and wiped the blood 
from the burro's head, where he had 
been struck with a stone, then patted 
him and talked to him kindly ; and 
when I had done so, I started to 
walk up the hill. I did not pull the 
rope, I just held it in my hand, and 
that little burro, as if an inspiration 
had come to him, climbed up the 
hill with the load on his back. When 
1 reached the top the man, who had 
followed, said, "What is your 
name?" I told him, and he then 
said, "Where is your home?" Then 
I broke down ; that was a very ten- 
der word to me. The man then 
asked, "Don't you want to go and 
live with me?" That was just what 
1 wanted, and 1 said 1 would be 
very pleased to go and live with 
him. He said. "Stay here until I 
come back, and you can go home 
with me." He went on down to 
the landing, sold his oranges, and 
came back, and I started to walk up 
the mountain with him. When he 
saw that I was weak, he picked me 
up, for he was a strong man, and 
set me in the saddle on the burro. 
I went into the orange grove where 
his home was, and stayed with him 
until I learned to talk the native 
language. 

Afterward, when 1 met Kvama, 
who had turned me out, I asked 
him why he had done that, and he 
said. "The minister holds a paper 
on my little home, so he can take 
it away from me, and he told me 
von were a viper, and that if T kept 
yon, yon would sting me to death; 



and so I neglected tending to you, 
because I was fearful of the min- 
ister. When I learned that, I walked 
straight for that minister's home. 
He had company when 1 came 
there, knocked on the door, and 
they bade me come in, and I told 
him what I came for. I asked him 
if it was true that he told that na- 
tive man not to feed me, and to turn 
me from his home, he said it was 
perfectly correct. I said, "You a 
minister of the gospel? Where do 
you find in the teachings of the 
Lord Jesus Christ anything that 
will justify you in treating me that 
way ? I had not wronged you, there 
is not a being on the face of the 
earth that can say that I have in- 
jured them ; and yet you told that 
man to starve me, and you told him 
things that were not true — you told 
him that I was a viper, that I would 
sting him to death, that 1 was an 
imposter. You told him things that 
you imagined, for which you had 
no proof, and I ask you to recall 
what you did, and make acknowl- 
edgment of it." 

Those are some of the things that 
I met with when 1 first went out 
into the world. It taught me some 
things ; it taught me that some at 
least, in the Christian world have 
lost the spirit of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. That was the 
beginning of my coming against 
men that should be fathers to the 
people — bright, intelligent men who 
have lost the spirit that should ac- 
company a man who is a professed 
servant of the living God. 

By and by, I undertook to preach. 
I remember my first text, it was the 
16th verse of the 16th chapter of 
Mark. Tt was what Christ said to 
His apostles when He met with 
them after His crucifixion : "Go ye 
intn (-he world, and preach the gos-

pel to every creature, he that be- 
lieveth and is baptized shall be 
saved." Now, to me that is very 
strong and authoritative language, 
"He that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved." Then I went on 
to tell of the signs that should fol- 
low those that believe. Now, I had 
lived among the Latter-day Saints 
from a child up, but I had not seen 
manifestations that brought con- 
viction directly to me in regard to 
the fulfillment of those things, and 
I wondered a little myself in re- 
gard to them. But they are true, 
my brethren and sisters. God has 
restored them again to the earth. 1 
will tell you the first one that I ever 
witnessed, when I was out in the 
world. It may be good for some 
of our young people at home to 
hear it. It was in the city of San 
Francisco. Apostle Parley P. Pratt 
was presiding there. Three of us, 
Elders Joseph F. Smith and Wil- 
liam W. duff, and myself were 
given the task of tracting the citv 
of San Francisco. Brother Joseph 
F. Smith could not stand it — he 
came home in the evening and said 
to Brother Pratt. "I will work anv 
place that you will put me to work 
— I do not care what the nature of 
the work is, I will do it ; but I will 
not walk the streets of San Fran- 
cisco and receive the abuse that T 
receive when T offer to give them a 
tract, I cannot stand it." Brother 
Pratt consecmentlv released him 
from it, and Brother Cluff was re- 
leased also, but he held me to the 
task. I guess it was a blessing to 
me that I was such a little boy, be- 
cause men felt ashamed to be very 
rough with me : and T kept at the 
work. One day when T returned 
from tracting, I came to Sister 
Evans', the widow ladv who was 
giving me a home, and she said, 



"Brother Young, hurry up stairs, 
they are having trouble up there." 
T passed upstairs, and found the 
little room was nearly filled, there 
was scarcely room for any more. 
Not many of them were Latter-day 
Saints, and there was an excitement 
there. A woman was lying upon 
the bed, and when I came into the 
room, she sprang from that bed and 
tried to climb the walls of the room, 
but seA'eral of the sisters took hold 
of her. Elder William McBride, an 
Elder of experience, was in the 
room and he said to me, "Come 
here quick." I was frightened but 
hurried to his side, and endeavored 
to put my hand upon the woman's 
head, but she grasped my hand in 
one of hers, and it seemed to me 
like a bird's claw ; and she barked 
at me furiously, as a dog will bark. 
But we succeeded in laying our 
hands upon her head, and Brother 
McBride rebuked the evil spirit ; 
she then became quiet and calm. 
The excitement caused Brother Mc- 
Bride to feel sick, and he withdrew. 
I stayed there with my hands rest- 
ing upon her forehead. After a 
while I thought she was asleep, and 
I drew my hands. Just then, Parley 
P. Pratt came into the room and 
she sprang from the bed again, and 
with difficulty they succeeded in 
controlling her. Brother Pratt 
spoke like one who had authority. 
In the name of Jesus Christ he re- 
buked the evil spirit, and command- 
ed it to leave the room, and we then 
had peace. That lady was not a 
member of our Church. The sisters 
waited upon her, and gave her a 
little refreshment. She talked a lit- 
tle while with President Pratt, and 
then Elder McBride and myself 
walked with her to a convenient 
place and baptized her into the 
Church.

I do not want to occupy more of 
your time. I thank my Heavenly 
Father that He has let me live to 
see this people grow as we have 
grown. I drove a pair of oxen 
hitched to a little cart, and helped 
haul the dirt from the foundation 
of this Temple, when I was a little 
boy. I feel to rejoice that I have 
lived to see this Temple completed, 
and to see the prosperity and the 
power that our Heavenly Father has 
given to His chosen people. 

May God help. you to be faithful 
and true to the covenants you have 
made. I testify to you that when 
I have had the privilege of going 
into holy places, I have only been 
taught lessons that have helped me 
be a virtuous, an honest, and a pray- 
erful man. This is my testimony to 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Historian.) 

The remarks made in the morn- 
ing session of the conference today 
by Elder Orson F. Whitney, in 
which he referred to the testimony 
of the late Anson Call, and the tes- 
timonies that we have listened to 
from Elder John R. Young, in this 
meeting, have suggested to me the 
following paragraph contained in 
the Book of Mormon, written at the 



time that Christ was manifesting 
Himself in person upon this conti- 
nent: 

"And when Nephi had brought forth 
the records, and laid them before him, 
he cast his eyes upon them and said, 

"Verily I say unto you, I command- 
ed my servant Samuel, the Lamanite, 
that he should testify unto this people, 
that at the day that the Father should 
glorify his name in me, that there 
were many saints who should arise 
from the dead, and should appear unto 
many, and should minister unto them. 
And he said unto them, were it not so? 

"And his disciples answered him and 
said, Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy 
according to thy words, and they were 
all fulfilled. 

"And Jesus said unto them, how be 
it that ye have not written this thing, 
that many saints did arise and ap- 
pear unto many, and did minister unto 
them, 

"And it came to pass that Nephi 
remembered that this thing had not 
been written. 

"And it came to pass that Jesus 
commanded that it should be written; 
therefore it was written according as 
he commanded." (3 Nephi 23:8-13.) 

I desire, in this connection, to 
give expression to a thought : 
Brother Young is one of a few in 
this vast assembly who was ac- 
quainted with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. The time will come, say in 
fifty years from now, that Saints 
who were acquainted with President 
Joseph F. Smith and his contem- 
poraries will be as scarce as the men 
who were acquainted with the orig- 
inal Prophet, Joseph Smith, are 
now. 

There are a great many events of 
modern times that have not been 
properly recorded. I want to draw 
atention to this fact, (as one of 
your historians), that a great num- 
ber of our veterans have neglected, 
and are still neglecting to record 
such things as we have listened to 



118 



G EN ERA L CON FE REN CE . 



with interest today. The testimony 
of Anson Call in regard to the 
Saints coming to these Rocky 
Mountains to become the mighty 
people they are today, is of great 
importance. 

We have had just a little said 
about this great prophecy. We have 
known for many years that on the 
6th of August, 1842, Joseph the 
Prophet made remarks of this kind, 
and just a few lines have been writ- 
ten in Church history concerning 
it, but as we have indeed become a 
mighty people in the Rocky Moun- 
tains, we want to know more about 
this important prediction which has 
been so literally and accurately ful- 
filled. A few lines are not sufficient 
to record a prophecy concerning 
such an event, if we can get any 
more. We do not want Anson 
Call's testimony only ; we would like 
a hundred other witnesses, if that 
many were present and heard the 
Prophet's words on that memorable 
occasion. We want the testimony 
of all who heard the Prophet utter 
this important prophecy. We want 
their testimonies recorded in the in- 
terest of the many millions of peo- 
ple who by and by will be interest- 
ed in the early days of this Church 
as well as in our day, and in all the 
days and years that have elapsed 
since Joseph Smith first began to 
receive revelations from on high. 
1 want to draw attention to this 
fact, brethren and sisters, and state 
here in your hearing that many 
things are not recorded that ought 
to be recorded concerning the his- 
tory of the Latter-day Saints. 

At the Historian's Office, we have 
already compiled about four hun- 
dred volumes of Church history, 
each containing about six hundred 
closely typewritten pages, and we 
have made an estimate that if we 



compile and put into proper shape 
the historical matter which we have 
in sight at present we will have at 
least one thousand volumes (con- 
taining six hundred pages each) of 
Church history for the Nineteenth 
century alone. This compilation 
then will represent six hundred 
thousand pages of records pertain- 
ing to the history of the Latter-day 
Saints for that period of time. Of 
course a great deal of this vast 
amount of material may be as to 
details more or less important and 
interesting, but as works of refer- 
ence for the benefit of those who 
shall live after us it will have in- 
calculable value. The books are be- 
ing prepared in such a way that we 
can add pages here and there. 
ITence, we can easily incorporate 
the testimony of Elder John R. 
Young who has spoken to us here 
today, and we can add the testimony 
of as many others as desire to place 
themselves on record in regard to 
any important event which they may 
have witnessed in their experiences 
in life. 

1 am safe in stating that there 
are thousands of people in the midst 
of the Latter-day Saints who ought 
to make a record of what they have 
seen, heard and done. They should 
especially bear testimony of the 
many blessings which they have re- 
ceived from the hand of the Lord 
through having yielded obedience to 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these 
the last clays ; and not .only that 
which happened in the days of the 
Prophet Joseph, or in the earlier 
days of the Church, should be faith- 
fully recorded, but that which has 
taken place all along since we came 
to these mountain valleys and that 
which is taking place day by day. 
My advice to everybody would be 
this : Write something concerning 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

your experiences in life and what 
you have seen and witnessed in con- 
nection with the Church of Christ 
— to bequeath to your posterity, so 
that it may be said of you like that 
which has been recorded of Abel 
of old, ''Though dead, he yet speak- 
eth." 

This is the thought I would like 
to impress upon all who hear my 
voice on this occasion and upon all 
who may read the record made of 
this general conference of the 
Chrnch. I would like to explain 
further that my advice does not 
apply only to our brethren and sis- 
ters who have grown old in the ser- 
vice of the Lord, and who may soon 
expect to go to the great Beyond to 
receive, in due time, the reward 
which their deeds in mortality merit 
at the hands of a righteous judge 
and a merciful God, but it applies 
as well to you who are middle-aged, 
and even those who are young men 
and women in our midst at the pres- 
ent time. The time will surely 
come when your testimony will be 
of great importance, just as much 
as the testimony that we have heard 
today, because this Church will con- 
tinue to grow, and out of it will 
finally come the kingdom of God. 
As yet we are scarcely a hand full 
compared to the many millions of 
people who inhabit our earth, but 
after our testimony, or the testi- 
mony of the elders of Israel, shall 
have been borne to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people, and af- 
ter these people who listen to that 
testimony shall have been converted 
and gathered to the Stake of Zion, 
and after such stakes shall have 
been organized in all parts of this 
great land of promise, then the ex- 
periences of those who in an early 
<'ay helped to establish the Church 
in the midst of these Rocky Moun- 



tains will, if recorded, be read with 
the greatest interest by millions and 
millions of God-fearing men and 
women, who shall rejoice in the suc- 
cess and triumph of Zion, and who 
shall be members of the- Church of 
Christ and citizens of the Kingdom 
of God at the time that Christ, our 
Redeemer, shall reign on the earth 
as the King of kings and Lord of 
lords. When that time comes, many 
of the events which to us now may 
seem commonplace will be things of 
vast importance, because many of 
the little deeds that we now do and 
to which we pay but very little at- 
tention at the present time are the 
seeds from which, using a figure 
"the sturdy oak" shall grow ; they 
may be the little things that shall 
mark the beginning of great 
achievements hereafter. 

Even the eyes of unbelievers are 
upon us at the present time. Think- 
ing men and women know what a 
community that is doing right, peo- 
ple who are living moral lives — 
means for the future, and the ad- 
versary of our souls, the great arch- 
enemy of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ, is alarmed, together with his 
emissaries, because of the stand we 
are taking in the world, and the suc- 
cess that has attended us so far. 
They know what a God-fearing and 
a righteous community represented 
by superior men and women may 
mean to the rest of the world at no 
distant day. They know that, 
through transgressions of the law 
of God and the laws of nature, the 
human family are becoming weaker 
all the time, and that strong men 
and women, who comply with the 
laws of nature and the law of Go', 
are bound to obtain dominion, in- 
fluence and power in the mr'st of 
the earth ; and this indeed is the des- 
tiny of the Latter-day Saints.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



While I was filling a mission in 
Scandinavia, a few years ago, an 
old Luthern priest who had studied 
our religious system, and had be- 
come acquainted with our ways of 
living, exclaimed, "If the Mormons 
continue that way they will in due 
course of time not only control lit- 
tle Denmark, but their power will 
be felt throughout the entire 
world, for they live a different life 
to that lived by the majority of the 
people in the world." In making this 
statement that priest did not par- 
ticularly refer to the Word of Wis- 
dom, but to our moral life and prac- 
tical religion in a general way. And 
the priest was right. If we Latter- 
day Saints, if you, the sons and 
daughters of Zion, will take ad- 
vantage of your birthright, if you 
will do what is right, serve God 
and keep His commandments, it is 
only a question of time when you 
will rule the world. It cannot be 
otherwise, unless mankind gener- 
ally will turn from their evil ways 
and become saints of the most high 
God. 

My brethren and sisters, may God 
help us to fulfil our mission and 
our destiny on the earth. May we 
indeed become the redeemers of the 
world and saviors upon Mount 
Zion, and may we labor diligently, 
with our whole might and strength, 
to usher in the great millenium 
when peace and happiness shall 
abound on the earth, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(Late President of Mexican Mission.) 

In speaking of the signs that 
should precede the second coming 
of our Lord, He said, "And this 
Gospel of the Kingdom shall be 



preached in all the world as a wit- 
ness unto every nation, and then 
shall the end come." 

My labors, for the past ten years, 
have been as a missionary in car- 
rying the Gospel of the Kingdom 
to the Mexican nation ; and I feel 
that in this unhappy hour for Mex- 
ico I would not be true to the trust 
that is imposed upon me if I did not 
tell you some of the things concern- 
ing that people that make them what 
they are. I wish to associate the 
unhappy conditions that exist in 
Mexico with the promises of the 
Lord made to that people when 
Father Lehi and his little colony left 
Jerusalem. The Lord made very 
plain the history of the Mexican 
people before Lehi ever set foot on 
this great continent of ours. Lehi 
said the following, and it is record- 
ed in the first chapter of the Sec- 
ond Book of Nephi : 

"Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained 
a promise, that inasmuch as those 
whom the Lord God shall bring out 
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep 
His commandments, they shall pros- 
per upon the face of this land; and 
they shall be kept from all other na- 
tions, that they may possess this land 
unto themselves. And if it so be that 
they shall keep His commandments, 
they shall be blessed upon the face of 
this land, and there shall be none to 
molest them, nor to take away the 
land of their inheritance; and they 
shall dwell safely for ever. 

'But, behold, when the time cometh 
that they shall dwindle in unbelief, 
after they have received so great bless- 
ings from the hand of the Lord; hav- 
ing a knowledge of the creation of 
the earth, and all men, knowing the 
great and marvelous works of the 
Lord from the creation of the world; 
having power given them to do all 
things by faith; having all the com- 
mandments from the beginning, and 
having been brought by His infinite 
goodness into this precious land of 
promise; behold, I say, if the day shall 
come that they will reject the Holy 



ELDER REY L. PRATT.

One of Israel, the true Messiah, their 
Redeemer and their God, behold the 
judgments of Him that is just shall 
rest upon them; 

"Yea, He will bring other nations 
unto them, and He will give unto them 
power, and He will take away from 
them the lands ot their possessions; 
and He will cause them to be scat- 
tered and smitten." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, as 
students of the Book of Mormon 
and history of that people who are 
descendants of Lehi, we know that 
they have not kept sacred the cove- 
nants that men make when they 
enter into covenant with God in the 
Gospel of His Son Jesus Christ, and 
we know that no sooner did that 
colony set foot on this land than 
there was a factional division, and 
they became two great peoples, the 
Nephites and the Lamanites, and 
that, at times, the Nephite faction 
was obedient to the commandments 
of the Lord and the Gospel as given 
to them, and, at rare intervals, so 
were the Lamanites. But there 
came a time when all apostatized, 
and when all came under the con- 
demnation herein spoken of, and the 
Lord caused the Nephite faction to 
be utterly destroyed at the hands of 
their brethren, the Lamanites, and 
the Lamanites went forth upon the 
face of the land in scattered bands, 
warring among themselves, as they 
had overcome their hereditary ene- 
my, the Nephites, and having in 
their blood the spirit of war and 
strife they satisfied it by fighting 
one with another. 

But the time came when the 
promises of the Lord were fulfilled 
in behalf of this people. In the 
year 1519, a little band of Span- 
iards, only a few, about 600, under 
the leadership of Hernan Cortez, set 
foot upon the shores of Mexico, and 
that man and his followers over- 



came a nation of 30,000,000 of peo- 
ple. It is a pitiful history to read, 
how they were "scattered and smit- 
ten," and how every inch of the land 
of their inheritance, that they had 
received of the Lord, was taken 
away from them. Now, brethren 
and sisters, we have in this the 
basic cause of all the strife that has 
existed in the land of Mexico for 
400 years in that that stricken people 
have bowed their heads under the 
tyranical rule of the Spanish people 
who came in among them. From 
a nation of 30,000,000, they have 
been reduced until today they are 
scarce 15,000,000. And the best 
statistics given out on the matter, 
state that of the 15,000,000 of in- 
habitants in the land of Mexico, 
only 2,000,000 are property holders. 
The others have nothing but their 
poverty and degredation, and we 
have in that the cause for the pres- 
ent strife. 

Now, I wish to associate the strife 
in Mexico also with the promises of 
the Lord, for if we do not have the 
promises of the Lord to comfort us 
in these things, I fear, brothers and 
sisters, that my faith would not be 
sufficiently strong to enable me to 
go forth and continue to preach the 
Gospel unto that people, as I love 
to do and always shall, as long as 
the servant of the Lord asks me 
to continue my labors in their be- 
half. 

It seems that if their decrease 
should continue very long, as it has 
been going on, they would be ut- 
terly wiped off the continent; and 
the history of the Mexican people is 
only a counterpart of the history of 
the Indian races that inhabit North 
and South America, for they have 
indeed been reduced to a remnant, 
they have become scattered and 
smitten ; and I defy anybody to 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



point to me a tribe of the aborignes 
of this country that owns legitimate- 
ly any of their own country in their 
tribal condition as they owned it 
primitively. It has been absolutely 
taken away from them by the na- 
tions that the Lord permitted to 
come in, and that in fulfillment of 
His words to them should they dis- 
obey the Gospel of His Son that 
should be given them. But thanks 
to the Lord, we know that they are 
His covenant people. We know that 
in their veins, flows the blood 
of Israel, and God has made prom- 
ise not only of their bringing down, 
but of their coming up ; and in that, 
we get faith and inspiration to go 
on and preach to them the Gospel, 
for their redemption ; for the Lord 
said this to Nephi, when He had 
shown him the same things that He 
had shown to his father, Lehi : 

"Nevertheless thou beholdest that 
the Gentiles who have gone forth out 
of captivity, and have been lifted up 
by the power of God above all other 
nations upon the face of the land, 
which is choice above all other lands 
which is the land that the Lord God 
hath covenanted with thy father, that 
His seed should have for the land of 
their inheritance, wherefore thou seest 
that the Lord God will not suffer that 
the Gentiles will utterly destroy the 
mixture of thy seed which are among 
thy brethren. Neither will He suffer 
that the Gentiles shall destroy the 
seed of thy brethren." (I Nephi 13, 
30-31.) 

Now, brethren and sitsers. in this 
we see that the Lord has not des- 
tined that this people should be ut- 
terly destroyed from off the face of 
the land. And I wish to call the 
youth of Israel to prepare them- 
selves for the mighty work that lies 
before us, for the Lord said, "This 
Gospel of the Kingdom shall be 
preached as a witness unto all na- 



tions, and unto every people before 
the end shall come," and we have 
lying before us, the millions of 
Mexico who know nothing of the 
Gospel, we have the millions of 
Central America, and the millions 
of South America. They are abso- 
lutely ignorant of the great plan of 
salvation that has been restored for 
the redemption of all people in the 
age in which we live. 

The Prophet Nephi said, (II 
Nephi 30:3-6): 

"And now, I would prophesy some- 
what more concerning the Jews and 
the Gentiles. For after the book of 
which I have spoken shall come forth, 
and be written unto the Gentiles, and 
sealed up again unto the Lord, there 
shall be many which shall believe the 
words which are written; and they 
shall carry them forth unto the rem- 
nant of our seed. 

"And then shall the remnant of our 
seed know concerning us, how that 
we came out from Jerusalem, and that 
they are descendants of the Jews. 

"And the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
shall be declared among them; where- 
fore, they shall be restored unto the 
knowledge of their fathers, and also 
to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, 
which was had among their fathers. 

"And then shall they rejoice; for 
they shall know that it is a blessing 
unto them from the hand of God: and 
their scales of darkness shall begin to 
fall from their eyes; and many gen- 
erations shall not pass away among 
them, save they shall be a white and 
delightsome people." 

Brethren and sisters, do we, as a 
people, believe in the words of the 
book that has been written? I tes- 
tify unto you that the Book of Mor- 
mon came forth in the world by the 
power and inspiration of God Al- 
mighty, and we have it as a new 
witness for Him in the world; and 
in that book we find the testimony 
that we among the gentiles who 
should receive that book and be-

lieve in the words of it, should carry 
it back again to the remnant of 
those people — and they are the 
Mexicans, the Central Americans, 
the South Americans, and the In- 
dian remnants, that cover our own 
clear land here. God is no respecter 
of persons, but of whatever nation, 
he that will serve Him and work 
righteousness is accepted of Him. 
What we want is to teach the Gos- 
pel in simplicity unto that people, 
as unto every other people, that 
they may find in the Gospel, in very 
deed, the power of God, that will 
lift them out of their degraded con- 
dition, that it may be unto them the 
power of God unto their salvation. 

We are opening up work among 
the Mexican people in the United 
States, and it may be a revelation to 
some of you to know that down in 
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, 
California, and Texas, there are 
hundreds of thousands of people of 
Mexican blood, that are citizens of 
the United States, and they are only 
waiting' for someone to open the 
doors of the Gospel to them. And 
the crying need today is for elders 
who are willing to sacrifice their 
own desires, and to humble them- 
selves before the Lord and carry in 
humility the word of the Lord back 
to that people. 

I am thankful for the integrity 
of our missionary boys that go out, 
but I am sorry that there is a feel- 
ing among some few, when they 
enter the field, of disappointment, 
and they feel that there is nothing 
coming back to them, and they ask 
the question, "What good will this 
all be to me?" Brethren and sis- 
ters, that is a false conception of 
the spirit of missionary work : the 
spirit of our missionary work 
should be, What good can I be to 
my fellowmen, what good can I be 



to God's children, and to sacrifice 
our own desires, our own ambi- 
tions and wishes to the betterment 
of those who sit in darkness. 

May the Lord help us to perform 
well our missions in the world, and 
extend the light of the Gospel unto 
all men, for God Himself is no re- 
specter of persons, and we should 
not be. I maintain that this Gos- 
pel of ours is destined sometime to 
wipe out racial feelings and to bring 
to us a universal brotherhood of 
man. 

God bless us to appreciate our 
blessings, I pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEO. ALBERT SMITH. 

Similarity of missions of Parley P. 
Pratt and his grandson, Rey L. 
Pratt — Prayer for success of mis- 
sionary work. 

I am sure, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the eyes of many of this 
congregation have been moistened 
while listening to the pathetic dis- 
course of President Rey L. Pratt 
with refernce to our Lamanite 
brethren and sisters. He comes 
naturally by his love for the Indian. 
His father and grandfather both 
were missionaries to the dark- 
skinned natives of America. He is 
a grandson of Parley P. Pratt, who 
was called by revelation, and his 
was the first name called by the 
Lord in our day to take the Gospel 
to the Lamanites, as I will read to 
you from the 23rd Section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants : 

"And now concerning my servant, 
Parley P. Pratt, behold, I say unto 
him, that as I live I will that he shall 
declare my gospel and learn of me, 
and be meek and lowly of heart; 

"And that which I have appointed 
unto him is that he shall go with 
my servants Oliver Cowdery and

Peter Whitmer, jun., into the wilder- 
ness among the Lamanites." 

I think it is a beautiful thing that 
today his grandson is permitted to 
stand in our midst and testify of the 
hope that he has of the fulfilment of 
the promise of our Father to our 
Indian brethren and sisters who are 
dear to him, who live in this and the 
adjacent nation. I am sure you 
have been glad to hear from Broth- 
er Pratt and that the mission still 
goes on notwithstanding the dif- 
ficulty they are having in that un- 
happy land. 

Let us each pray to the Lord that 
His promises may be fulfilled in the 
interests of these our brethren and 
sisters, let each of us live so that 
if we should be called, that the Lord 
may be able to work through us for 
the amelioration of the condition of 
millions of His children who know 
not the Gospel of our Lord as we 
have received it. Let us go to our 
homes each with the determination 
that, the Lord helping us, we will 
serve Him and keep His command- 
ments and fulfil the obligations re- 
sulting from receiving His word. 

May you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, carry the spirit of this great 
gathering to your homes. May you 
have the desire to disseminate the 
truth taught among your associates, 
that your experience here may 
thereby be more profitable. May 
this conference be treasured in your 
memories as a time of refreshing 
from the Lord. And that each of 
us may magnify our opportunities 
and be worthy of the blessings of 
our Father in heaven, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn, "We thank Thee, O God, 
for a Prophet." 

Elder Benjamin Goddard of- 
fered the closing prayer. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir sang Evan Stephens' 
hymn, "Loyal to the True and the 
Right." 

The invocation was offered by 
Elder Brigham F. Grant. 

A chorus, entitled "The Snow," 
was rendered by the choir. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

A marvelous work and a wonder — 
The "Mormon Church" — Character- 
istic teachings of the Church con- 
cerning Jesus the Christ — The 
Lord's second advent — Near at hand 
— Today and tomorrow — The 
Church and the Kingdom. 

The presence of these multitudes 
at each recurring conference of the 
Church, and particularly the spirit 
of . earnestness and devotion which 
the people manifest, appeal to me 
as striking evidences of the marvel- 
ous work and the wonder which the 
God of Israel has accomplished and 
is accomplishing in these, the last 
days. That great work, of which 
the prophets in the ages past have 
predicted to be characteristic of the 
day toward which they looked with 
anxious and eager anticipation, is 
the establishment of the Church 
and the development and growth 
thereof in the dispensation of ful- 
ness. 

The kingdom of God has been set 
up upon the earth. In ancient writ, 
scriptural and otherwise, the ex- 
pressions "Kingdom of God" and 
"Kingdom of Heaven" were often 
used interchangeably ; or at least 
our modern translation of those 
writings present to us interchange- 
able usages of these names and 
titles of the great institutions ; but 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



125 



in this, as in many other instances, 
we find the light of modern revela- 
tion illuming and making plain 
what may otherwise be dark and in 
part unintelligible. Through the 
revelations given in this day and 
age, we recognize the fact that 
there is a distinction between the 
kingdom of God and the kingdom 
of Heaven. The Church estab- 
lished in the present age, embody- 
ing the restored Gospel, is the 
Kingdom of God, it is the Church 
of Jesus Christ. 

The members of that Church are 
often spoken of as "Mormons," 
and the Church has come to be 
known more generally as the 
"Mormon Church" than by its 
proper name and distinguishing 
title, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. We as a 
people do not maintain any strong 
protest against the application of 
the term "Mormon" and its several 
derivatives ; though we deplore the 
fact that misunderstanding may 
arise in the minds of inquirers and 
investigators respecting the sig- 
nificance of that name, which orig- 
inally was used as a nickname in its 
application to the Church. You 
may call us Mormons if you will; 
remember, however, as you must — 
must, if you will have respect 
unto the truth — that this is not 
the church of Mormon. Mormon 
was a man, a very worthy man and 
a very great man in his day when 
he lived in the flesh, and a very 
great personage since that time ; but 
he was a man among men, and 
while his name is very properly ap- 
plied to the abridgement of certain 
early records, which abridgement 
he made and supplemented by many 
writings of his own, now published 
under the name of the Book of 
Mormon, the Church is not his 



church, nor is it the church of Peter 
or James or John, nor is it the 
church of Joseph Smith, nor of 
Brigham Young, nor of Joseph F. 
Smith, nor the church of the pres- 
ent authorities of the body. It is 
the Church of Jesus Christ and it 
is the only Church upon the face of 
the earth affirming divine author- 
ization for the use of the name of 
the Savior of mankind as part of 
its distinctive designation. 

It is very proper that we inquire 
as to what particular message the 
Church thus distinguished has to 
give to the world respecting its 
Master, its divine Head, the Son of 
the living God, in vindication of its 
claims to so honorable a title as 
that which it bears. In the first 
place, it reiterates all the truth that 
has been given in former ages and 
earlier dispensations regarding 
Jesus Christ and His ministry, and 
it sets forth in plainness, together 
with other matters of the greatest 
worth, knowledge beyond all price, 
which has been given unto the 
Church as new revelation in the 
day and age in which we live. 
Among the distinguishing features 
of the teachings of the Church con- 
cerning the Savior and Redeemer 
of the race are these: 

First, the Church affirms the 
unity and continuity of the mission 
of the Christ in all ages. This, of 
necessity, involves the actuality, the 
verity, of His pre-existence and pre- 
ordination or foreordination in the 
spirit state. 

Second, the fact of His ante- 
mortal Godship. 

Third, the actuality of His birth in 
the flesh as the natural issue of di- 
vine and mortal parentage. 

Fourth, the reality of His death 
and physical resurrection, as a re- 
sult of which the power of death 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



over mankind shall be eventually 
overcome. 

Fifth, the literalness of the atone- 
ment wrought by Him, and the ab- 
solute requirement of individual 
compliance with the laws and re- 
quirements of His Gospel as the 
only means by which salvation may- 
be attained. 

Sixth, the restoration of His 
Priesthood and the re-establish- 
ment of His Church in the current 
age, which is verily the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times. 

Seventh, the certainty of His re- 
turn to earth in the near future 
with power and great glory to reign 
in person and in bodily presence as 
Lord and King - . 

In the interest of conciseness I 
have read these several specifica- 
tions as they have been summarized 
and will appear in the forthcoming 
edition of a work now published by 
the Church to its members and to 
the world respecting the life and 
mission of Jesus the Christ. I in- 
vite your attention to the last of 
these specified points, the certainty 
of the return of Jesus Christ to 
earth in the near future, to reign 
upon the earth in person by bodily 
presence as the rightful King of 
earth. You have read, I am sure, 
of the wondrous incidents con- 
nected with the association of the 
resurrected Christ with the apostles 
and others between the time of His 
resurrection and that of His ascen- 
sion from Mount Olivet, and when, 
on that eventful day, He led the 
Eleven who were still faithful to 
Him, and whom He had ordained 
to the holy apostleship, out toward 
Bethany. As He was conversing 
with them and giving them final in- 
struction and doubtless encourage- 
ment, He rose from their midst and 
they saw Him ascend until He was 



hidden from their sight. In wor- 
shipful wonder they became aware 
of the presence of personages other 
than themselves — white-robed mes- 
sengers from heaven who, remark- 
ing their wonder and astonish- 
ment, addressed them in these 
words: "Ye men of Galilee, why 
stand ye gazing up into heaven ? 
This same Jesus, which is taken 
up from you into heaven, shall 
so come in like manner as ye have 
seen him go into heaven." From 
that day the apostles preached the 
return of the Christ to earth, even 
as prophets before their time had 
predicted the great event. By the 
second advent of Christ we do not 
mean His manifestation to chosen 
prophets, to individuals or to a few, 
such as His ministrations to Saul of 
Tarsus or His appearance to Joseph 
Smith in 1820 and again in the 
Kirtland temple after the organiza- 
tion of the Church, but a return in 
glory of which all the world shall 
know. His coming shall be like 
unto the lightning that flashes from 
the east to the west, to be seen of 
all men. 

This Church proclaims the doc- 
trine of the impending return of 
the Christ to earth in literal simplic- 
ity, without mental or other reser- 
vation in our interpretation of the 
scriptural predictions. He will come 
with the body of flesh and bones 
in which His Spirit was tabernacled 
when He ascended from Mount 
Olivet. One of the characteristic 
features of the Church concerning 
that great, and in the language of 
the scripture, both glorious and 
terrible event, is its nearness. It 
is close at hand. The mission of 
the Church is to prepare the earth 
for the coming of its Lord. Bib- 
lical prophecies are numerous; the 
Book of Mormon prophecies are

abundant, respecting the return of 
the Christ. His own words, both 
before and after His crucifixion 
and resurrection are unambiguous, 
definite, convincing, and convicting 
unto those who do not close their 
ears wilfully against the truth. Re- 
ferring to Himself the Savior said : 
"For the Son of man shall come in 
the glory of his Father with his 
angels ; and then he shall reward 
every man according to his works." 
Read the context in the 16th chap- 
ter of Matthew. The prophets who 
lived before the meridian of time 
said comparatively little, though 
their testimony is abundant and all 
sufficient, concerning the return of 
the Christ; for they were devoted 
to the teaching of the doctrine of 
His first coming in the flesh, to live 
among men, to suffer and to die 
and to be resurrected from the 
dead. But after His resurrection 
and ascension the words of inspired 
teachers were definite in fore-tell- 
ing the certainty of His return ; and 
in this day and age of the world 
He has spoken with His own voice 
unto His prophets, impressing upon 
them the fact that the time of His 
coming in judgment is near at 
hand. Thus, within a few months 
after the Church was organized, in 
the year 1830, as recorded in the 
29th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, the Lord Jesus Christ 
said unto His Prophet Joseph 
Smith : 

"For the hour is nigh and the day 
soon at hand when the earth is ripe; 
and all the proud and they that do 
wickedly shall oe as stubble, and I 
will burn them up, saith the Lord of 
hosts, that wickedness shall not be 
upon the earth; 

"For the hour is nigh, and that 
which was spoken by mine apostles 
must be fulfilled; for as they spoke so 
shall it come to pass; 



"For T will reveal myself from 
heaven with power and great glory, 
with all the hosts thereof and dwell 
in righteousness with men on earth 
a thousand years, and the wicked 
shall not stand." 

A month later, or at least in the 
month following, He spake again 
admonishing His servants to dili- 
gence : 

"Wherefore," said He, "be faith- 
ful, praying always, having your 
lamps trimmed and burning, and 
oil with you, that you may be ready 
at the coming of the Bridegroom ; 
for behold, verily, verily, I say 
unto you, that I come quickly. 
Even so. Amen." 

Referring to the teachings of the 
apostles of old, and particularly to 
His own instructions unto them, 
and employing the same figure by 
which He had made plain unto them 
that men may know of the immi- 
nence of His coming, by the signs 
which He specified, He said in 
March, 1831, again speaking 
through His Prophet Joseph : 

"Ye look and behold the fig trees 
and ye see them with your eyes and 
ye say that when they begin to shoot 
forth and their leaves are yet tender 
that summer is now nigh at hand. 

"Even so it shall be in that day 
when they shall see all these things, 
then shall they know that the hour is 
nigh. 

"And it shall come to pass that he 
that feareth me shall be looking forth 
for the great day of the Lord to come, 
even for the signs of the coming of 
the Son of man: 

"And they shall see signs and won- 
ders, for they shall be shown forth 
in the heavens above, and in the earth 
beneath; 

"And they shall behold blood, and 
fire, and vapors of smoke; 

"And before the day of the Lord 
shall come, the sun shall be dark- 
ened, and the moon be turned into 
blood, and stars fall from heaven; 

"And the remnant shall be gath- 
ered unto this place, 



128

"And then they shall look for me, 
and, behold, I will come; and they 
shall see me in the clouds of heaven, 
clothed with power and great glory, 
with all the holy angels; and he that 
watches not for me shall be cut off." 

Still further impressing upon the 
Church in the early days of its his- 
tory the fact that there was no time 
to be lost in preparation, for the 
time was all too short, He made 
plain the fact that His coming was 
so near that the intervening time is 
properly to be spoken of as today. 
"Behold, now it is called today," 
said He, "until the coming of the 
Son of man ; and verily it is a day 
of sacrifice and a day for the tith- 
ing of my people ; for he that is 
tithed shall not be burned at his 
coming, for after today cometh the 
burning. This is speaking after 
the manner of the Lord ; for verily 
I say, tomorrow all the proud and 
they that do wickedly shall be as 
stubble ; and I will burn them up, 
for I am the Lord of hosts ; and I 
will not spare any that remain in 
Babylon. Wherefore, if ye believe 
me, ye will labor while it is called 
today." 

The scriptures abound in declar- 
ations and reiterations, in re- 
peated and solemn affirmations of 
the great fact that the day of the 
Lord's coming will be a day of 
glory and a day of terror — of glory 
and recompense unto those who are 
living righteously, and a day of 
terror unto the proud and unto all 
who do wickedly. Now, many 
have asked, do we interpret that 
scripture as meaning that in the day 
of the Lord's coming, all who are 
not members of the Church shall 
be burned, or otherwise destroyed, 
and only this little body of men and 
women, very small compared with 
the uncounted hosts of men now 



living, shall be spared the burning 
and shall escape destruction? I 
think not so. I do not think we are 
justified in putting that interpre- 
tation upon the Lord's word, for 
He recognizes every man according 
to the integrity of his heart, and 
men who have not been able to un- 
derstand the Gospel or who have 
not had opportunity of learning it 
and knowing of it will not be 
counted as the wilfully sinful who 
are fit only to be burned as stubble ; 
but the proud, who lift themselves 
in the pride of their hearts and rise 
above the word of God and become 
a law unto themselves and who wil- 
fully and with knowledge deny the 
saving virtues of the atonement of 
Christ, and who are seeking to lead 
others away from the truth will be 
dealt with by Him according to 
both justice and mercy. 

A word concerning the distinc- 
tion between the Kingdom and the 
Church. As already stated, the ex- 
pression "Kingdom of God" is used 
synonomously with the term 
"Church of Christ" ; but the Lord 
had made plain that He sometimes 
used the term "Kingdom of Heav- 
en" in a distinctive sense. In 1832 
He called attention to that in these 
words, addressing Himself to the 
elders of the Church: 

"Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one 
from on high, who is mighty and 
powerful, whose going forth is unto 
the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice 
is unto men — Prepare ye the way of 
the Lord, make his paths straight. 

"The keys of the kingdom of God 
are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the Gospel roll 
forth unto the ends of the earth, as 
the stone which is cut out of the 
mountain without hands shall roll 
forth until it has filled the whole 
earth; 

"Yea, a voice crying — Prepare ye 
thf way of the Lord, prepare ye the

supper of the Lamb, make ready for 
the bridegroom; 

"Pray unto the Lord, call upon his 
holy name, make known his wonder- 
ful works among the people; 

"Call upon the Lord, that his king- 
dom may go forth upon the earth, 
that the inhabitants thereof may re- 
ceive it, and be prepared for the days 
to come, in the which the Son of man 
shall come down in neaven, clothed in 
the brightness of his glory, to meet 
the kingdom of God which is set up 
on the earth; 

"Wherefore may the kingdom of 
God go forth, that the kingdom of 
heaven may come, that Thou, O God, 
mayest be glorified in heaven, so on 
earth, that thy enemies may be sub- 
dued, for Thine is the honor, power 
and glory, forever and ever. Amen." 

Such was the prayer, such is the 
prayer, prescribed for this people 
to pray, not to utter in words only, 
not to say only, but to pray — that 
the Kingdom of God may roll forth 
in the earth to prepare the earth for 
the coming of the Kingdom of 
Heaven. That provision in the 
Lord's prayer, "Thy kingdom come, 
thy will be done on earth as it is 
in heaven" has not been abrogated. 
We are praying for the Kingdom 
of Heaven to come, and are en- 
deavoring to prepare the earth for 
its coming. The Kingdom of God, 
already set up upon the earth, does 
not aspire to temporal domination 
among the nations. It seeks not 
to overthrow any existing forms of 
government ; it does not profess to 
exercise control in matters that per- 
tain to the governments of the 
earth, except by teaching correct 
principles and trying to get men to 
live according to the principles of 
true government, before the King- 
dom of Heaven shall come and be 
established upon the earth with a 
King at the head. But when He 
comes, He shall rule and reign, for 
it is His right. 



Many of us are prone to think 
that the day of His coming, the day 
of the setting up of the Kingdom 
of Heaven in its power and glory 
is yet far distant. I take it that 
that assumption is based, perhaps, 
upon our wish, none the less real, 
because we hesitate to frame it in 
words. How would you feel if 
authoritative proclamation were 
made here today that on the literal 
morrow, when the sun shall rise 
again in the east, the Lord would 
appear in His glory to take ven- 
geance upon the wicked, and to 
establish His Kingdom upon the 
earth? Who amongst you would 
rejoice? The pure in heart would, 
the righteous in soul would, but 
many of us would wish to have the 
event put off. We are very much 
in the frame of mind, or we may 
allow ourselves to fall in the frame 
of mind of the rule bound Phari- 
sees and the casuistical Sadducees 
in the days of the Christ in the flesh. 
They were intent upon keeping the 
people's interest alive in a future 
Messiah, in a Christ who was to 
come, but not one who was amongst 
them. We are very loath to accept 
and believe that which we do not 
want to believe, and the world to- 
day does not wish to believe that 
the coming of the Christ is near at 
hand, and consequently all kinds of 
subterfuges are invented for ex- 
plaining away the plain words of 
scripture. We rejoice in simplicity. 
The Gospel of Jesus Christ is won- 
fully simple. We as a people val- 
ue, I believe, scholastic attainments 
at their full worth. While we fos- 
ter and encourage the training and 
development of the mind, .1 was 
about to say to the full limit, cer- 
tainly almost to the limit, of our 
material ability, as witness the un- 
ceasing effort and continuous ex-

penditure of vast sums in the main- 
tenance of church schools, and the 
willingness with which the Latter- 
day Saints as members of the com- 
munity impose upon themselves, in 
common with their fellow citizens, 
taxes for the support of schools un- 
der state control and direction, we 
nevertheless hold that scholastic 
attainments are not essential to a 
full understanding of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. We do not believe 
that a diploma from a theological 
seminary is an essential part of the 
credentials of a teacher or preacher 
of the word of God. Nevertheless 
we endeavor to encourage and aid 
in a material way the training of 
the mind and the development of all 
the faculties that shall be conducive 
to educational advancement in the 
truest sense of the term, but we 
hold the Gospel is simple that all 
may understand it who will. It is 
the proud and they who do wick- 
edly who close their eyes and their 
ears and their hearts to the signs 
of the times, to the word of the 
Gospel and to the testimony of the 
Christ. It has long been a favor- 
ite excuse of men who were not 
ready for the advent of the Lord, 
to say, "The Lord delayeth His 
coming." Don't attach too much 
importance to the fact that He has 
thus far delayed His coming, for 
He has repeatedly told us that the 
day of His coming is very, very 
near, even at our doors. There is 
a tendency among men to explain 
away what they don't wish to un- 
derstand in literal simplicity, . and 
we, as Latter-day Saints are not 
entirely free from the taint of that 
tendency. Prophecies that have 
not yet been fulfilled are by many 
of us made the subjects of hypoth- 
esis and theory and strained inter- 
pretation. We read that one of the 



characteristic signs to precede the 
second advent of Christ shall be the 
bringing forth of the tribes that 
have been lost to history, led away 
where men have not yet found 
them, and we are told that they 
shall be brought forth with a strong 
hand by the power of God and shall 
come unto Zion and receive their 
blessings at the hands of Ephraim. 
But some people say that prediction 
is to be explained in this way : A 
gathering is in progress, and has 
been in progress from the early 
days of this Church; and thus the 
"Lost Tribes" are now being gath- 
ered ; but that we are not to look 
for the return of any body of peo- 
ple now unknown as to their where- 
abouts. True, the gathering is in 
progress, this is a gathering dispen- 
sation ; but the prophecy stands that 
the tribes shall be brought forth 
from their hiding place bringing 
their scriptures with them, which 
scriptures shall become one with 
the scriptures of the Jews, the holy 
Bible, and with the scriptures of 
the Nephites, the Book of Mormon, 
and with the scriptures of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints as embodied in the 
volumes of modern revelation. 

The Lord has said it. I am just 
simple-minded enough, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to stand upon the 
rock of assurance that not one jot 
or tittle of the word of the Lord 
shall fail. Do not allow yourselves 
to think that the coming of the 
Christ means merely the spread of 
different or more advanced ideas 
among men, or simply the progress 
and advancement of society as an 
institution. These shall be but in- 
cidents of the great consummation, 
the consummation of this particu- 
lar stage or epoch of the Lord's 
work. The Lord Jesus Christ shall 
come in the clouds of heaven, ac-

companied by the heavenly hosts, 
and His advent shall be marked by 
a great extension of the resurrec- 
tion of the just, which has been in 
progress since that resurrection 
Sunday on which He came forth 
from the tomb and took up the 
wounded, pierced body which He 
had laid down; and those who are 
not able to bear the glory of His 
coming because of their wickedness, 
their foulness, and wilful state of 
sin, shall, by natural means, perish. 
A strong current of electricity pass- 
es safely through a pure conductor, 
but where resistance is encountered 
it becomes a destructive power. It 
was necessary that the work for the 
dead be undertaken by the living, 
that temples be reared and this vi- 
carious labor be performed, that 
the hearts of the departed fathers 
might be turned toward their yet 
mortal descendants, and the hearts 
of mortal children be turned to their 
dead ancestors, lest the earth be 
smitten with a curse at the time of 
the Lord's coming. 

The Bible is very simple to those 
who read it with earnest and hon- 
est intent, as are all the scriptures, 
but it is very puzzling to the theol- 
ogians, very puzzling, sometimes to 
Biblical scholars and interpreters 
who seek to apply to it only those 
tests that are common among men. 
I rejoice in the testimony of the 
Savior that He is verily the Christ 
and we proclaim Him as such. 
Great interest is manifest at this 
time in the work and ministry of 
Jesus Christ, not only among the 
Latter-day Saints but in the world 
in general ; and He has been anal- 
yzed and measured and written 
about from many points of view, 
and as viewed from many different 
angles. There are volumes of re- 
cent publication dealing with the 



Christ of literature, the Christ of 
history, the Christ of reason, the 
Christ of experience. Never lived 
a man of whom more has been said 
or sung ; and there is none to whom 
is devoted a greater share of the 
world's literature. But the ten- 
dency is to view Him from this 
angle or that and not to look with 
direct vision. I am thankful that 
the Church to which I belong 
preaches Christ and Him crucified, 
and resurrected, the Christ that 
ascended into heaven, the Christ 
that shall come again, the Christ 
that was the offspring in the flesh, 
as well as in the spirit, of the very 
Eternal Father, the Christ who is 
the Savior and Redeemer of man- 
kind, beside whom there is none, be- 
side whose name there is no name 
under heaven, whereby mankind 
may be saved. May His Spirit be 
ever with us, and may we be pre- 
pared for His coming, I humbly 
ask, in His name. Amen.

Loyalty, a doctrine of the L. D. S. 
Church — God the only King on this 
land of Liberty — "Mormonism" 
makes f c good citizenship" — No 
"hyphenated" Americans in "Mor- 
mon" Church, all are true Ameri- 
cans — Admirable characteristics in 
people of other countries. 

It comes as a surprise to me, my 
brethren and sisters, to be asked to 
occupy this position this afternoon. 
I respond cheerfully, however, and 
even gladly, to testify to you of my 
faith and confidence in this work 
of the Lord and of the blessing that 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



it has in store for mankind, to all 
who believe and obey. 

While the first song was being 
sung this afternoon, "Loyal to the 
true and the right," I thought in 
that line was composed the whole 
duty of man, for if I am loyal to the 
truth and to the right in all things ; 
then I must be at all points accept- 
able to God, my Heavenly Father. 
We are taught in the revelations of 
the Almighty to this Church the 
doctrine of loyalty. If we believe 
really and truly in the doctrines of 
the Church, and believe that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, then 
that very belief must of necessity 
make us better citizens than those 
who do not so believe. Why? 
Because I believe that God -Al- 
mighty raised up men to lay the 
foundations of this great govern- 
ment. I believe in the Book of Mor- 
mon, which declares that there 
should be no king upon this land, 
but that God would be our King. 
By a singular co-incidence, the 
writer of one of our national songs 
seems to have hit upon this very 
thought, when he declares in the 
last verse of the hymn, "My Coun- 
try, 'Tis of Thee" : 

"Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
Author of Liberty, 

To Thee we sing; 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by Thy might, 

Great God, our King." 

The same inspiration that gave 
to Joseph Smith the understanding 
that there should be no king, but 
that the Lord would be our King 
upon this land, gave to the author 
of the song, our national anthem 
(who, by the way, is a Smith also) 
the same inspiration, that the Lord 
our God should be King over this 
land. Believing so, and under- 



standing that the Lord has had a 
hand in the establishment of this 
freedom and liberty that we enjoy, 
I say that if I really believe it, and 
live by it, that citizenship which I 
have must of necessity be more sa- 
cred to me, and will make me a bet- 
ter citizen than the man who does 
not believe that God raised up the 
founders of this land, and that He 
declared that there should be no 
king, only that He should be King, 
and that we should have Him and 
look to Him as King and Ruler of 
all. 

So, "Mormonism" makes for 
good citizenship, don't you see — 
the best, the very best that there is. 
I do not say but what there are mil- 
lions of excellent citizens — I know 
there are — in our land here who are 
loyal to what they believe to be 
right, but I want to impress upon 
you, and if my words could only go 
out to the world who do not under- 
stand us, this further fact that my 
religion impels me, constrains me, 
nay, I may say compels me, if I 
will listen to its advice, to be a bet- 
ter citizen in consequence of the 
belief in that religion, than I could 
be without it. And so we desire, as 
said in Brother Stephens' song, to 
be "loyal to the true and the right." 

There is no hyphen with "Mor- 
monism." We have in this Church 
no Scotch- Americans or Danish- 
Americans, or German-Americans, 
not one ; we are all Americans. 
Why? Because God is our King. 
No King George of England or 
King Wilhelm of Germany or no 
other do we acknowledge here, only 
the great God Almighty, He is our 
Ruler, He is our King, Him we will 
serve. And so right on that, a ques- 
tion is settled that which has to 
a certain extent perplexed this 
nation at this time, the hyphen- 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY. 



133 



ated American, as they call 
him, who owes, as he thinks, 
some allegiance to some other coun- 
try than his own, whether it be Eng- 
land or Germany or what it be. In 
England they are singing, today, as 
they sing always, "God save our 
gracious king, Long live our noble 
king, God save the king," but in this 
country we are singing, "Great God, 
our King," and the hyphenated cit- 
izen cannot exist in "Mormonism." 
There is a problem that is solved by 
our religion which may trouble the 
people, and which has troubled 
some of the leaders of this nation, 
and is troubling them at the pres- 
ent time, and I would like the word 
to go out that by the very fact that 
a man is a Latter-day Saint, a mem- 
ber of the "Mormon' Church, if 
you please, that by that fact it is 
impossible for him to be a hyphen- 
ated citizen or to have any hyphen 
between his native country and his 
home here in the mountains. His 
religion teaches him loyalty-teaches 
him that he must absolve himself 
from all emperors, from all poten- 
tates, from all countries ; and that 
this is the land of Zion, and that 
he must abide here and revere the 
King of this land, who is God Al- 
mighty Himself. 

Now I am not saying that there 
are not good people in different 
lands who take different views on 
this question. I admire the peoples, 
many of them, who are at war at 
this present time. The German na- 
tion as a people — there is no better 
people in all the world than the 
German people ; they have proved 
it, too, before this war began, in 
efficiency, in every man who could 
work being at work, work provided 
for him in some way, and more or 
less every man contented and com- 
paratively happy. They had given 



all the nations of the world a les- 
son in this respect; they had even 
given us a lesson, but there are 
those who hold, and I am one of 
them, that the very system which 
has grown up there is to some ex- 
tent subversive of liberty; the sys- 
tem, not the people ; the people, I 
repeat, are of the very best and 
choicest in the' world. Our Ger- 
man brethren and sisters, who have 
come from that land, and are set- 
tled with us here in this land of 
Zion, there are no better people 
among us ; you cannot produce them 
anywhere. But I wish those Ger- 
man brothers and sisters, and Eng- 
lish and Scotch and French, to re- 
member this — I must repeat it 
again, and my time is up, I see — 
that there is no hyphen connected 
with the loyalty of citizenship when 
once you are a "Mormon." 

I use that word "Mormon" as 
applied to a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, so that it may be more wide- 
ly known, if possible, that this 
Church, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, makes for the 
best citizenship in all the world. The 
very teaching of my Church, my re- 
ligion, the counsel of those who are 
over me, the revelations of Jesus 
Christ to me, impel me to the best 
citizenship, to be "loyal to the true 
and the right," and that there shall 
be no hyphen connected with the 
"Mormonism" and citizenship of 
any one who is connected with it. 

God bless you, bless Israel, bless 
those who give guidance and direc- 
tion to this organization ; the Lord 
does that through His servants. 
The Lord bless those servants that 
we may listen to them, and if we do 
we will never go far wrong. The 
Lord bless Zion, multiply and in- 
crease the people of Zion; that we

may be kind to the poor, that we 
may see that the poor do not suffer 
— that is a principle of our religion 
and we must live it — the poor shall 
not. want and suffer while there is 
abundance in the Church. The Lord 
bless us and help us to understand 
our duties and do them, and be 
"loyal to the true and the right," 
through Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I hold in my hand an excerpt 
from a recent number of the 
Outlook, of which Mr. Lyman Ab- 
bott, a religious teacher of great 
fame is the editor and also the pub- 
lisher. In it he has a department in 
which he answers questions from 
those whom he calls "unknown 
friends," and this question appears 
in that column : 

_ "Have there been any prophets 
since Christ who add to the great 
prophecies which are of value to those 
who wish to know the truth; or is it 
sufficient tc know the old prophets 
and the teachings of Christ?" 

To this question Mr. Abbott 
makes the following answer : 

"The prophets, we are told, spoke as 
they were moved, inspired, guided by 
the spirit of God. There is no reason 
to suppose that God has ceased to 
move upon the spirits of men and to 
inspire and guide them. Certainly 
there is nothing in the New Testa- 
ment to warrant any such opinion. 
Peter expressly declares that the 
promise of the Holy Spirit is to all 
who will receive it, and Paul bids us 
pray that we may be filled with all 
fulness of God." 

To the second part of the ques- 
tion he answers : 

"On the other hand there is ho 
reason to suppose that anything has 
been added to the substantial truths 



respecting God and His relations to 
His children, which are taught in the 
Old and New Testaments. Their 
teachings that God loves and serves 
and sacrifices Himself in love for His 
children leaves nothing beyond to be 
desired or even to be conceived. The 
prophets since that revelation are 
guided, not to add new truths, but to 
show how the truth of love, the love 
of God to man, and the love of man 
to God and to each other, is to be ap- 
plied in all the changing situations 
and conditions of human life." 

I thought I would like to read 
that passage to this great multitude, 
because in some respects it does 
mark a forward movement in the 
conceptions of this religious teach- 
er, at least, in regard to the princi- 
ple of revelation. In the early his- 
tory of our Church, the great nov- 
elty associated with it, and the won- 
der of its message, seemed to be that 
God had again spoken from the 
heavens ; that angels had visited 
servants of God to restore the Gos- 
pel. This was the point at which 
our message was met by the re- 
ligious teachers of those times with 
the claim that the volume of scrip- 
ture was completed, and forever 
closed ; that the awful voice of 
prophecy would no more be heard, 
that the last word of revelation had 
been spoken. In that controversy 
the early elders of the Church ob- 
tained an easy victory over their 
opponents ; because it was so easy 
for them to do just what Mr. Ly- 
man Abbott here does, namely, 
point to the fact that prophecy came 
not in olden times by the will of 
man, but holy men of God spake as 
they were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, and wherever that spirit is 
possessed there is the spirit of 
prophecy ; and it was an incon- 
sistency on the part of the Chris- 
tian world to claim that they 
were in possession of the Holy 
Ghost and yet without the gift of 



ELDER B. H. HOBERTS.

prophecy and of revelation. Con- 
sequently, I say, the victory of 
God's servants on that point was 
easily obtained. Mr. Abbott con- 
cedes the reasonableness of that ar- 
gument, because he himself here 
uses it. But the astonishing thing 
in connection with this answer of 
his to the question submitted to him 
is, in the second part of it, viz., that 
while admitting that the spirit of 
prophecy may still be upon the chil- 
dren of men, and there may be 
prophets among Christians, who 
possess that spirit, yet they may add 
nothing new to what has been re- 
vealed ! It would be extremely in- 
teresting to point out to Mr. Abbott 
and those who think with him how 
great necessity there is for divine 
wisdom to be manifested in, and di- 
vine instructions given upon, every 
many vital religious questions. One 
might call his attention, for in- 
stance, to the fact that in the matter 
of the very ordinance by which men 
may be admitted into the Church 
of Christ — baptism — the formula 
to be used and the proper subjects 
of baptism, and the purpose of bap- 
tism — in respect of all this the 
Christian world seems not able to 
come to a unity of the faith. Evi- 
dently they constitute problems that 
may not be solved by the scholar- 
ship of the world, applied to the in- 
terpretation of the scriptures, either 
in the original language in which 
they were written or in the transla- 
tions ; for Christendom is hopeless- 
ly divided upon these subjects, and 
the world stands in need of the 
word of God to settle their disputes. 
I am happy to know that the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, which proclaims the re- 
opening of the heavens and the res- 
toration of the Gospel, with divine 
authority to administer its ordin- 



ances, has a message to the world 
from God upon this subject of bap- 
tism; and that when the Lord re- 
stored that part of the Gospel, He 
fittitngly did so by sending him who 
was known in earth-life pre-emi- 
nently as The Baptist, and he re- 
stored the authority to baptize, and 
he supervised the first baptisms in 
this dispensation of the fulness of 
times. That is one added truth 
that has been revealed by the Lord 
in this dispensation. 

I might also call the attention of 
Mr. Abbott and those who think 
with him that in the important mat- 
ter of administering the holy sacra- 
ment — the Lord's Supper — the 
means that God has established in 
his Church for the perpetuation — 
Latter-day Saints, mark it! — for the 
perpetuation of the spiritual life 
that he brings into existence 
through acceptance of the Gospel, 
they are — the Christian world- — 
they are without the formula by 
which the emblems of our Lord's 
Supper may be fittingly and effec- 
tively consecrated to this great 
spiritual purpose. They know not 
how to administer the holy sacra- 
ment of the Lord's supper, for the 
perpetuation of the spiritual life of 
man. Through the Book of Mor- 
mon and in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, by the revelations we there 
have, something more is added to 
the religious truths by which men 
may be guided, viz., the prayer for 
consecration of the holy sacrament. 

It is not, however, for the pur- 
pose of referring to these matters, 
and many more that could be enu- 
merated, did time permit, that I 
presented the answer of Mr. Ab- 
bott to the questions that I have 
read to you. I did not have bap- 
tism and the sacrament in mind, but 
this : He tells us that no added

truth to that which is contained in 
the Old and New Testaments in 
respect of God may be looked for, 
notwithstanding the admitted pres- 
sence of the spirit of revelation 
among men ; and I wanted to place 
this man's statement in contrast 
with the great truths that have been 
announced in this conference, by 
President Smith and President Pen- 
rose, as proof that a world of added 
knowledge, of intelligence, and un- 
derstanding respecting God has 
been brought forth by the revela- 
tions of God to the great prophet of 
this new dispensation, Joseph Smith. 
Two things confuse the world to- 
day in respect to their knowledge 
of God — the duty that some feel, on 
the one hand, to regard God as a 
personality; and on the other hand 
to regard Him as universal spirit, 
as everywhere present, and every- 
where present with power. Recon- 
ciliation of the two conceptions is 
puzzling the theologians and the 
philosophers. Dean Mansel, in his 
great lecture, which amounts to a 
book, on the subject of "Limitations 
of Religious Thought," writes this 
as his conclusion : "It is our duty 
to think of God as personal, and it 
is our duty to believe that He is in- 
finite;" although he confesses that 
there is something inconsistent with 
the two views. Herbert Spencer 
seizing upon this inconsistency of 
the dean's and commenting upon 
the conclusions, remarks : "Let 
those who can believe there is eter- 
nal war between our intellectual 
faculties and our moral obligations. 
I for one, admit no such radical vice 
in the constitution of things." Of 
course, when you speak of God as a 
person, especially if you regard 
Him as a person in the sense that 
He is an individual., of whom Jesus 
the Christ, as a resurrected, immor- 
tal, and all-glorious personage was 



the full and complete manifestation — 
if you thus regard personality, then 
to think of God as everywhere pres- 
ent, diffused as a presence and a 
power through all His creations, 
there does appear a contradiction; 
because form means limitation in 
space, and the simplest philosophy 
teaches that a body, an object of 
form, bounded as it must be by cer- 
tain lines, cannot at the same in- 
stant be present in two different 
places ; that cannot be. 

The scriptures do teach, however, 
these two things — about God, viz., 
that God is a person of whom Jesus 
Christ is "the brightness of His 
glory and the express image of His 
person ;" and they also teach the 
omnipresence, or every whereness of 
God. David said when he contem- 
plated perhaps — I know not — but 
perhaps, the desirability of getting 
away from the presence of God, be- 
cause of his great sins ; but in any 
event he was led to remark — and it 
is scripture, and it presents the 
truth : 

"Whither shall I go from Thy 
Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy 
presence? If I ascend up into heaven, 
thou art there. If I make my bed in 
hell, behold Thou art there. If I take 
the wings of the morning and dwell 
in the uttermost parts of the sea, even 
there shall Thy hand lead me, and 
Thy right hand shall hold me. If I 
say, surely the darkness shall cover 
me; even the night shall be light about 
me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from 
Thee; but the night shineth as the 
day: the darkness and the light are 
both alike to Thee." 

Yet Mr. Gladstone, the great 
English statesman, like Dean Man- 
sel, felt the need of holding to the 
conception of the personality of 
God. Indeed, he regarded it as the 
need of the world, and the hope of 
the future. Speaking of those 
questions to his friend, Mr. Stead, 
who asked him, a short time before 



ELDER B. H. HOBERTS. 



137 



his death, what his greatest hope 
for the future of humanity was, the 
great statesman replied : 

"I should say we must look for that 
to the maintenance of the faith in the 
invisible. That is the great hope of 
the future. It is the mainstay of civ- 
ilization; and by that I mean a living 
faith in a personal God. I do not hold 
with streams of tendency; after sixty 
years of public life, I hold more 
strongly than ever to this conviction, 
deepened and strengthened by long 
experience, of the reality, and near- 
ness, and personality of God." 

But you observe that among 
these great minds there is a marked 
diversity of opinion concerning this 
great question, the necessity of 
holding to the faith of a personal 
God, and at the same time other 
men equally intellectual doubting 
the possibility of holding in con- 
sciousness and in faith the person- 
ality of God and at the same time 
His everywhereness. What a bless- 
ing that Prophet would be to his 
generation who should have his 
mind moved upon by the holy spirit, 
or who, by direct revelation and 
face to face communion with God, 
could come to the world with a 
word from the inner fact of things, 
and settle this question. Mr. Ab- 
bott needs it settled for him, as 
also other people need it settled for 
them. No human wisdom could 
find that word, but the inspired 
prophet of this new dispensation 
comes with a message that will set- 
tle it; a message that appeals to 
the understanding as well as to the 
emotions and the desires of men in 
their thirst for knowledge of God; 
and I may so far trespass upon your 
titme as to read that brief message 
in which both great truths — the 
personality of God and the univer- 
sality of His presence are main- 
tained. Listen to this sweetest — no, 
I may not say that it is the sweetest 



message, as it is difficult to tell 
which is the sweetest out of the 
many messages that God is sending 
forth to the world in this new dis- 
pensation ; so perhaps I am not 
warranted in characterizing one as 
sweeter than another, but listen to 
this splendid message that our 
Church has for the world. Speak- 
ing of the Son of God, this reve- 
lation says : 

"He that ascended up on high, as 
also He descended below all things ; 
in that He comprehended all things, 
that He might be in all and through 
all things, the light of truth." That 
is, the power by which the truth is 
manifested. "Which truth shineth." 
That is, it is apparent, not hidden ; 
it is before your vision. "Which 
truth shineth. This is the light of 
Christ." I pray you remember that 
phrase. "As also He" this light of 
Christ, "is in' the sun, and the light 
of the sun, and the power thereof 
by which it was made. 

"As also the light of the stars, and 
the power thereof by which they were 
made. 

"And the earth also, and the power 
thereof; even the earth upon which 
you stand. 

"And the light which now shineth, 
which giveth you light, is through 
Him who enlighteneth your eyes, 
which is the same light that quicken- 
eth your understandings." 

The Apostle John speaks of it as 
"the light that lighteth every man 
that cometh into the world." Job 
must have had it in mind when he 
said : "There is a spirit in man, and 
the inspiration of God giveth him 
understanding." But to continue 
with the revelation in the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

"Which is the same light that 
quickeneth your understanding ;" 
and now the message, "which 
light," the creative power, world- 
sustaining power, intelligence-in- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spiring power — "which light pro- 
ceedeth forth from the presence of 
God to fill the immensity of space. 

"The light which is in all things ; 
which giveth life" — and therefore 
the vital force in the universe — 
"which giveth life to all things ; 
which is the law by which all things 
are governed : even the power of 
God who sitteth upon his throne, 
who is in the bosom of eternity, who 
is in the midst of all things." 

Now, my beloved brethren, with 
this great truth before you, it is 
easy to comprehend the great mys- 
tery that confuses the world, name- 
ly, how to hold in your conscious- 
ness, in your faith, the belief that 
God is a personality in the sense 
that He is a glorified individual such 
as the Christ was after His resurrec- 
tion, and now is — an immortal per- 
sonage. We know not, perhaps, on 
what bright sphere, as a personality 
He makes His home, but wherever 
He is, as a personality, the Christ, 
is as He left the earth — after His 
resurrection — He is as He will re- 
turn to the earth, as set forth in the 
remarks of Elder Talmage at this 
conference. It is also possible at the 
same time to regard Him as a uni- 
versal presence and power — which 
men rightly call God — proceeding 
forth from the personal presence of 
the Christ, also from the presence 
of God the Father, and from the 
presence of the Holy Spirit — there 
goes forth into the space depths, the 
Spirit which emanating from these 
Holy Personages fills the immen- 
sity of space with the very pres- 
ence land power of God. That 
presence and power is constantly 
maintained, too, and is actual pres- 
ence of God in all consciousness, in 
seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing, 
and loving. I say this presence 
called in the revelation I have read 
from "the lisfht of Christ" — be- 



cause it is of His nature, and 
strongly bears forth into space his 
attributes — this Spirit is actual pres- 
ence of God ; for as the ray of light 
is not separate from its source, so 
this Spirit and Power which pro- 
ceeds from the presence of God is 
not separated from the personages 
of the Godhead whence He proceeds 
to fill the immensity of space. In 
this manner God in-dwells in his 
worlds, and those worlds in which 
God in-dwells shall fulfill and ac- 
complish the purposes of God. 

This is the immanent Deity of 
which men in our day have so much 
to say ; and for our enlightenment — 
that we might know God — even the 
Spirit of God — though proceeding 
from the several Divine personages 
of the Godhead — is called "the 
Light of Christ/' for the reason al- 
ready given, and, further, that the 
Christ might be in very deed and in 
all respects the manifestation, or 
evelation of God to man. 

I thought I would like to present 
this truth that attention might be 
called to the world's problem re- 
garding the doctrine of God ; and 
that the sermons of President Smith 
and President Penrose might stand 
as an answer to the sophistry and 
vain philosophy of the times about 
nothing being added by revelation 
to the world's knowledge of God. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

To demonstrate the sweetness of 
tones of the remodeled great organ, 
Prof. John J. McClellan played var- 
iations of the music, now usually 
sung to the hymn, "O, my Father." 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Heavens are telling the glory of 
God." 

Elder Walter P. Monson pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months.

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 

[The copy of the stenographer's tran- 
script of Elder Andrew Kimball's dis- 
course having been lost in transmis- 
sion by mail, Elder Kimball has writ- 
ten a statement covering the principal 
features of said discourse, and it is 
printed here. It would have been in- 
cluded in that part of the pamphlet 
where the other discourses appear that 
were delivered at the outdoor meet- 
ing, Sunday afternoon, April 9, but 
was received too late for insertion 
therein.] 

What appeals to me as one of the 
strongest testimonies of the divine 
calling of Joseph Smith as a 
Prophet, and benefactor of his race, 
is that contained in the revelation 
known as "the Word of Wisdom" 
(Sec. 89, Doctrine and Covenants). 
It is eighty-three years since 
the Lord admonished the world, 
through His Prophet, that strong 
drinks and tobacco were not good 
for man. 

Recently, while in Los Angeles, a 
gentleman who had been active in 



our state in the Anti-saloon League 
work, and now employed in the 
fight against the saloon in Cali- 
fornia, lectured before an audience 
at the Latter-day Saints Church, on 
the subject of prohibition. In the 
course of his remarks he traced de- 
velopments from an early day in 
this country, showing activities of 
various sectarian churches in their 
efforts to break down the liquor 
traffic. When he had concluded, 
Elder Joseph E. Robinson, Presi- 
dent of the California mission, read 
the following revelation, and showed 
conclusively that through the "Mor- 
mon" Prophet, God had made 
known the truths concerning the 
detrimental use of liquor and to- 
bacco, antedating every other move 
made in the world. I will here 
read the revelation : 

[The speaker read the "Word of 
Wisdom" in full] 

For over eighty years this peo- 
ple, the Latter-day Saints, have been 
taught, and have more or less ab- 
stained, not only from the use of 
intoxicating liquors, but also tea 
and coffee and tobacco, and the re- 
sult is we have two or three gener- 
ations of our people almost entirely 
free from the evil effects of these 
contaminating things. 

The Lord has made no mistake in 
this revelation ; like many other 
good things, He has given to the 
world admonitions and command- 
ments calculated to improve His 
children physically, as well as spir- 
itually. Along this line of reform, 
as also in many others, the "Mor- 
mon" people living in Arizona have 
been foremost and among the most 
reliable of the people residing in 
that State. 

Saloon keepers are bluffers ; they 
would make you believe that the 
abolition of the saloon would de- 
stroy all business relations, they

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



urge that the loss of revenue would 
be so great you would have no 
means to run the government, that 
business would be dull ; in short, it 
would kill the country. This is 
about the kind of talk they gave us 
in Arizona when we went into the 
light and put them out of business. 
In 1901 it was my good fortune 
to secure the passage of the 
"Texas" local option law while a 
member of the Arizona Territorial 
Legislature, but, my friends, "local 
option" will not do the work. Three 
counties only took advantage of the 
law and voted dry. They were 
where the Latter-day Saints were 
in the majority. 

Later, while an effort was made 
to amend the law, its enemies seg- 
regated the large cities from the 
country districts, making it almost 
impossible to rid the municipalities 
of the saloon ; so we can say from 
experience, that while local option 
is better than the saloon, it is not 
sweeping enough in its effects to 
rid the country of the liquor traffic, 
accordingly we insisted upon State- 
wide prohibition. 

The Temperance Federation of 
Arizona, so termed, was organized, 
an executive committee was chosen, 
with representation from the vari- 
ous organizations, W. C. T. U. 
Young Men's and Young Ladies' 
Christian Associations, Labor Fed- 
eration, the various sectarian 
churches, business and professional 
interests, and our "Mormon" peo- 
ple, women being very active in the 
work. We gave women their fran- 
chise and they gave us a dry state. 
God bless the women. 

A private citizen of one of our 
leading cities compiled statistics of 
the State, covering a period of but 
six months, and termed the com- 
pilation, "Six Months Prohibition 



in Arizona." From this pamphlet I 
will give you a few figures. You 
may draw your own conclusions as 
to the havoc wrought in Arizona by 
closing the saloons. It must be re- 
membered that when the saloons 
closed Dec. 31, 1914, at 12 o'clock 
at night, many saloon keepers re- 
tained a quantity of liquor, and 
scores of citizens laid in a supply, 
so that when the law went into ef- 
fect the State was not quite dry. I 
here give you the wording of the 
prohibition amendment to the Con- 
stitution : 

"Ardent soil its, ale, beer, wine or in- 
toxicating liquor or liquors of what- 
ever kind shall not be manufactured in 
or introduced into the state of Arizona 
under any pretense. Every person 
who sells, exchanges, gives, barters, 
or disposes of any ardent spirits, ale, 
beer, wine, or intoxicating liquor of 
any kind to anv person in the state of 
Arizona, or who manufactures, or in- 
troduces into, or attempts to intro- 
duce into the state of Arizona any 
ardent spirits, ale, beer, wine, or in- 
toxicating liquor of any kind, shall be 
guilty of a misdeameanor and upon 
conviction shall be imprisoned for not 
less than ten days nor more than two 
years and fined not less than twenty- 
five dollars and costs nor more than 
three hundred dollars and costs for 
each offense: provided, that nothing in 
this amendment shall apply to the 
manufacture or sale of denatured alco- 
hol." 

The constitutional amendment 
made it mandatory upon the first 
State Legislature to enact police 
regulations for the enforcement of 
the law. This they failed to do, so 
that all we have accomplished has 
been under the mandates of the con- 
stitution. 

Efficiency increased in the work- 
ingmen of the state in six months, 
according to these statistics, an av- 
erage over the state of 25 per cent, 
and at the Copper Queen, the larg-

est copper company, 31.4 per cent. 
Understand by this that, before pro- 
hibition, after each pay day through 
employes spending their wages and 
time in the saloon, and recovering 
from the consequences of drink, 
they would lay off two or three days 
each month, causing the company 
to lose 31.4 per cent in the efficiency 
of its operations. The pay rolls 
. being $4,000,000, 25 per cent of 
that amount is $1,000,000 saved, for 
now men go to work after pay day. 
Eighty-four per cent reported for 
work before prohibition, 98 per cent 
since. 

When men drank up their wages, 
their boys had to stay out of school 
to help support the family. There 
has been a great increase in attend- 
ance in the public schools, and 50 
per cent increase in our state uni- 
versity. 

There is 37.3 per cent less crime 
in the country, and 50 per cent less 
in the cities. Drunkenness has de- 
creased 85 per cent. There has 
been 2880 less arrests for drunken- 
ness in the state in six months. 

Eleven out of fourteen counties 
went dry. Three (Mormon) 
counties were already dry through 
local option. There has been 796 
less commitments in six months, a 
saving, by decrease in arrests, of 
$50,773.98, a falling off of 50 per 
cent in commitments. 

In cities and towns of promi- 
nence there has been a decrease in 
arrests of 2.403, an average of 50 
per cent ; saving by such decrease 
$85,170.14. While the state has 
apparently sustained a loss in reve- 
nue of $100,998, but when we take 
into consideration the many chan- 
nels through which business has in- 
creased, this loss of revenue is more 
than made up in business channels. 



In considering the moral benefits, it 
is inestimable. 

In Phoenix, our capital, there 
were 1125 less arrests in six 
months, 6 less police employed, 
$20,000 less cost in city govern- 
ment. 

The City of Tucson had 255 less 
arrests for drunkenness. Such ar- 
rests had cost $12.50 each, thus 
making a saving of $3,000 in six 
months, or $6,000 annually. 

Taxes have not increased in con- 
sequence of phohibition. 

In Apache county, taxes have de- 
creased 14.5 per cent, and in Gra- 
ham (my county) 28.5 per cent. 
These counties had been dry long 
enough to make a showing. 

There has been a great increase 
in savings deposits. Before pro- 
hibition, the laboring men, on pay 
day, would deposit their pay check 
in the saloon and go home with a 
stomach full of liquor and an empty 
pocket book. Now they deposit 
their earnings in the postal savings 
and in banks. There has been an 
increase of $387,252.00 in the postal 
savings, and over $3,000,000 in the 
banks. 

Where the saloon formerly stood, 
you now see progressive business 
institutions, moving picture shows, 
and other taxable property. Where 
before prohibition, children were 
running the streets barefooted and 
hungry, and mothers humiliated 
and dejected; now, under prohi- 
bition, there are thousands of happy 
homes. 

There has been a corresponding 
increase in public spiritedness, good 
roads, public improvements, better 
markets, and in every way there has 
been a livening up of affairs, 
greater confidence in business, and 
a general uplift to society. 

At the annual Temperance Con- 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



vention held this spring in Phoenix, 
and while presiding during the eve- 
ning session, I presented the fol- 
lowing figures on the birth rate and 
death rate of the various nations of 
the world, figures that may be used 
to prove the good effects of tem- 
perance. 

A short time after this meeting, 
the president of the Federation 
wrote and asked me for a copy, say- 
ing that of all the papers and talks 
in the convention this had im- 
pressed him most. These figures 
came into my hands from a very re- 
liable source, and you can depend 
upon them as being correct, at least 
up to a recent date.

It will be observed from these 
figures that the death rate is some- 
thing like one-half of the birth rate, 
in the United States — 28 births, 14 
deaths. France, you will observe, 
has more die than live ; consequent- 
ly, unless they attend more closely 
to family raising, they will eventu- 
ally become extinct. The state of 



Kansas has the lowest death rate of 
any in the Union, which can be ac- 
counted for because of their long 
drawn out efforts for temperance. 
But what we get out of this com- 
parison is that the Latter-day Saints 
lead the world in high birth-rate 
and low death-rate. This does not 
mean only its numbers residing in 
these healthy mountain valleys, and 
the offspring of "Mormon" parent- 
age, but our people in all the world. 
There has been more or less sym- 
pathy extended to our people living 
in Arizona, but mark from church 
statistics the splendid high birth- 
rate and low death-rate. The four 
stakes average 44 births to the 
thousand, and 7.2 deaths ; and the 
St. Joseph stake, where I have the 
honor to preside, leads the average 
of the Church, with 44 birth-rate 
and 6 death-rate. I am not claim- 
ing that this splendid record is be- 
cause the state went dry a little 
over a year ago, but it is a fact that 
we are largely the offspring of 
"Mormon" parentage who . have 
lived temperate lives. 

Another thing, the test is now on 
in these United States. I quote from 
headlines in a Cambridge, Mass., 
paper, under date of March 19, 
"Americans Not Fit for Duty. 
Average Man Can't Meet Military 
Hardships, Says Harvard Profes- 
sor." Compare this unfortunate 
condition with the acknowledged 
fact that not to exceed 10 per cent 
of American boys can stand the 
military examination. Is it not about 
time we were taking notice, and as 
an American people, correcting our 
mode of living ? Contrast this with 
the record of "Mormon" boys. I 
was told that 100 per cent of our 
boys at St. Johns, Arizona, passed 
muster when undergoing examina- 
tion for the National Guard. 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL.

Intemperance alone is not respon- 
sible for this alarming status of our 
American young manhood. It was 
told me by an instructor in a col- 
lege in Los Angeles that from 75 
to 90 per cent of the male popula- 
tion of that city, and other large 
cities of our nation, were more or 
less affected with disease resulting 
from immorality. As a general rule, 
this is traceable to intemperance, 
which, of course, with all its attend- 
ant evils, mean disaster to the hu- 
man family. 



What is "Mormonism" doing? 
What are we doing, as a people, to 
uphold the high standards of right 
living ? As I observed at the begin- 
ning of my remarks, the temporal 
salvation of this people means the 
perpetuation of a people whose 
work is not only to preach the gos- 
pel of spiritual salvation, but also 
the practical uplift of humanity, and 
observance of God's laws by His 
children upon the earth. Amen.

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and the con- 
ference services were commenced 
by the choir and congregation sing-

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight.

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all ! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ger- 
man E. Ellsworth. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Come, come ye saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
'Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive. 
Do this, and joy your hearts will sweli — 
All is well ! all is well !

lief. — Only 'Gospel truths taught by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. — The 
doctrines divine, the hatred unjusti- 
fiable. — Personal denial of wrong 
doing. — Eternal relationship of par- 
ents and children. — Distant colon- 
ization objectionable. — Peace, good- 
will, and industry enjoined. — Satan's 
rage increased, and his power di- 
minished, when Saints are faithful. 

I desire to express our feeling of 
welcome and good cheer to all the 
Latter-day Saints who have assem- 
bled here this morning for the open- 
ing session of our Conference. We 
are glad to see you, and we thank 
you for your presence here, for we 
feel that your presence is an evi- 
dence of the interest that you feel in 
our Conference, and in the great 
work of human redemption, in 
which you and we all are and 
should be earnestly engaged. It is 
a matter of congratulation, I think, 
to the Latter-day Saints that they 
are led by a spirit that inclines their 
thoughts, their minds and hearts to- 
wards the performance and' accom- 
plishment of the duties and respon- 
sibilities that rest upon them, and I 
take it as an evidence of your good 
faith, and of your fervent belief and 
feeling in the cause in which we 
are engaged, that you are present 
here today. 

I hope and pray that the Spirit of 
the Lord, the Spirit of wisdom and 
of eternal truth may pervade all 
the sessions of this Conference, in- 
cluding the meetings or gatherings 
of the various organizations which 
will hold their conventions during 
the time of the Conference. I hope 
that those who shall address the 
people may be led by the Spirit of 
God in their remarks, that they may 
speak words of comfort, of instruc- 
tion, of wisdom and testimony to 
the Latter-day Saints regarding the 



great work of God that has been es- 
tablished in the latter days in the 
earth. 

Whatever may be the feeling of 
those opposed to the work of the 
Lord, whatever may be the feeling 
of the unbelieving and scornful, and 
those that are contemptuous toward 
the work of the Lord, let the spirit 
of wisdom, of good judgment, of 
intelligence govern and direct all 
the acts and labors, and all the 
thoughts and desires of the Latter- 
day Saints. It matters but very lit- 
tle to me what men may think of 
me, or what they may say about me, 
so long as I can maintain a con- 
sciousness of having righteousness 
in view, of having an earnest desire 
to do good and not evil, and so long- 
as I am conscious that I am, to the 
best of my knowledge and under- 
standing, following the dictates of 
my conscience, and the promptings 
of the Spirit of the Lord to me in 
the line of my duty. -Yet we often 
wonder why people are led by such 
a spirit of bitterness, of animosity 
and opposition to any people or to 
any individual whose record in life 
has been, barring the common 
weaknesses of common mortality, 
absolutely above reproach. It is 
surprising how men can become so 
vile as to publish and declare slan- 
derous things, falsehoods and mis- 
representations with regard to men 
and people who have never in their 
lives done any man or woman, or 
any community of people in the 
world, any harm ; who have never 
injured a soul, and whose whole 
life and mission, hopes, labors, and 
earnest desires have been to benefit 
the world, and to bless and ameli- 
orate the condition of mankind. It 
is surprising that such is the case. 
Such has been the case from the be- 
ginning of this work until now. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

and such will continue to be the 
case so long as we abide in the 
truth, and are guided by the spirit 
of revelation, and have an earnest 
desire to do good to the children of 
men, and there are men who are 
full of wickedness and sin. 

It was said away back in the 
early days in the State of Missouri, 
by the leaders of the persecution 
against the Saints there, that all 
they desired was that the Mormons, 
or the Latter-day Saints, should 
discard their idea of revelation 
from God in this dispensation ; that 
they should renounce their faith in 
Prophets and their claim to the 
Apostleship, and to the restoration 
of the Holy Priesthood; that they 
should scatter abroad, cease to or- 
ganize, and to maintain their or- 
ganization, and become "like the rest 
of us." That was all that they de- 
manded in that early day, and it is 
a very true and correct index to 
the feeling of our enemies that has 
existed ever since, to the present 
time. Men are moved by some in- 
fluence, some spirit — judge ye what 
the nature of that spirit or influence 
is — to try with all their power to 
demoralize, debase, and sow the 
seeds of unbelief, the seeds of cor- 
ruption, error, lack of faith, and 
desire to do good ; to sow the seeds 
of disruption in the hearts of the 
people called Latter-day Saints, in 
order that their desire might be ac- 
complished, that they should be- 
come "like the rest of them," like 
the rest , of the world, and what is 
the difference? The difference is 
simply this: We believe just as 
the best Christians, or so-called be- 
lievers in Christ in the world be- 
lieve, that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Son of the Living God ; that He is 
the Savior of the world ; that He is 
the Redeemer of men from sin and 



from death unto life; and there is 
no people, whatever their profession 
may be, that believe in Christ more 
firmly, more perfectly, more confid- 
ingly, than do the Latter-day Saints 
— but where is the difference ? The 
difference, so far as that belief is 
concerned, is this : that the world 
say all that is necessary is to be- 
lieve and you will be saved, but the 
Latter-day Saints declare that it is 
simply a mockery for men to say 
they believe in Christ, and refuse to 
do the works that He did ; it is sim- 
ply folly ; it is un-Christian ; it is 
inconsistent for men to say that all 
that is necessary for men is to be- 
lieve in Christ and they shall be 
saved, when Christ Himself declar- 
ed that He required all men to do 
the works that He did, and to keep 
the commandments that He gave 
unto them. This is the difference. 
We believe that it is necessary to do 
the work that He did. We believe 
it is necessary to implicitly obey 
His commands and to follow in His 
footsteps, to emulate His example 
to the best of our ability, that we 
may become more and more like 
unto Him. Now, so far as that is 
concerned, wherein is man injured? 
Who is hurt ? Who in any sense in 
the world sustains any wrong at the 
hands of a people who believe in 
doing the works that were com- 
manded of the Lord, and in fol- 
lowing in His footsteps? Who is 
wronged by it? But the trouble is 
just as the Savior said: "If the 
light had not come, then would ye 
have been without condemnation." 
But this is the condemnation of the 
world, the light has come into the 
world, and the world loves darkness 
more than it does the light. That is 
the condemnation, and there is 
where the shoe pinches. 

And what is the difference? We

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



believe in the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; we believe that the Lord 
God Almighty raised up that boy 
and made him a Prophet; a Seer 
and a Revelator, and that through 
him, or that instrumentality, the 
Lord Almighty has restored to men 
the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, which is indeed the power 
of God unto salvation. The world 
don't believe it. They are welcome 
to their belief, whether it be belief 
or unbelief. We are not here as 
censors upon the judgment or be- 
lief of the children of men. We are 
not here to bring any railing accu- 
sations against men for their belief. 
Let them believe and worship how, 
where and what they may. That is 
their prerogative. But we object to 
their bringing railing accusations 
against our belief and our faith. 
We think that we should have the 
same privilege and liberty to be- 
lieve as we please, that the world 
has, and that we accede to the 
world ; and because we believe in 
Joseph Smith as a Prophet of God, 
the world is in no wise injured by 
it, but on the contrary, it is vastly 
benefited by that belief, at least to 
the extent that that belief takes hold 
upon honest men, and brings them 
to a knowledge of that great truth. 

What did Joseph reveal ? He re- 
vealed, or has been the instrument 
in the hands of God of revealing to 
the world Jesus, the Son of God, in 
His own person. He has been the 
instrument in the hands of the Lord 
of bringing the light to the inhab- 
itants of the world that God lives, 
that Christ lives, whom to know is 
life eternal, and whom the world 
have ignorantly worshiped as a 
myth, as something that fills the 
immensity of space, but is inde- 
scribable; a something that is al- 
mighty and all-powerful and all- 



present, but without personal exis- 
tence. Joseph has revealed to the 
world that Jesus Christ " who was 
crucified and rose again from the 
dead, is a personal Being, in whose 
likeness and image man is made, or 
is begotten in the world, and that 
the Father is a person in exact sim- 
ilitude to the Son. We have the 
history of the Son, given us by Plis 
disciples who sojourned with Him 
while He was in the mortal flesh : 
that He was born of His mother, 
Mary; that He was called the car- 
penter's son ; that He grew to man- 
hood ; that He taught the Gosrjel of 
Jesus Christ, and illustrated the ex- 
ample of righteousness, that is the 
true type for all mankind to imitate 
and follow ; that He possessed pow- 
er over death, and though they put 
Him to death, He rose again, and 
that while His body lay in the 
tomb, He proclaimed the same Gos- 
pel that He preached to the living, 
to those that were confined in dark- 
ness, and banishment from the pres- 
ence of the Lord, in outer darkness, 
because of their wickedness while 
they were in the flesh; and quick- 
ened by the Spirit He went and 
preached the Gospel to them as He 
had preached it to the living; and 
that when He rose and identified 
Himself beyond the possibility of 
any doubt to the minds of those 
who witnessed and saw Him, and 
knew Him, and afterwards testi- 
fied of Him to the world, that He 
was the same that was crucified, 
bearing the marks of the nails and 
of the spear in His body; that He 
was not a spirit ; that He was flesh 
and bone as- tangible as man, and 
that a spirit had not this flesh and 
bone as He had. He declared this 
to the world: This same physical, 
tangible entity called Jesus of Naz- 
areth, the son of Mary and the Son

of God, in His resurrected body, 
came to Joseph Smith, revealed 
Himself to Joseph Smith, the same 
God, the same Christ, the same Re- 
deemed of the world that was cru- 
cified on Calvary; and, that God, 
the Father, is like His Son; that 
it would be inconsistent and impos- 
sible for a spirit to beget a man like 
Christ, and therefore the Father 
and the Son are the exact resem- 
blance of each other. Joseph re- 
vealed this to the world. Who is 
hurt by it? Who is injured by this 
fact and by this revelation to the 
children of men? In what respect 
is the world worse off for having 
received this knowledge? I tell you 
that the world would be better off, 
a thousand times better off, if they 
would but consider this truth and 
receive it in their hearts, and then 
be guided by the doctrine that Jo- 
seph Smith was the" instrument in 
the hands of God in revealing anew 
to the world. 

This, then, is the difference, but 
wherein are you injuring anybody 
by it? What wrong are you do- 
ing ? None whatever. Why should 
men be embittered against you be- 
cause of this, because of your be- 
lief in Joseph Smith? Why should 
they become your enemies because 
you declare your faith in a new 
revelation from the Father and 
from the Son to mankind for their 
guidance? Why should they? Let 
me tell you why : for the very same 
reason precisely that the embittered 
and unbelieving Pharisees and hyp- 
ocrites of the Savior's time perse- 
cuted the Redeemer of earth, for 
the very reason that they later put 
to death the disciples of Jesus 
Christ, whom He ordained as 
Apostles and as special witnesses 
of Himself, who bore testimony of 
Him and of the Gospel to all the 



nations of the earth. They put 
them to death one by one, some of 
them in the most cruel manner, sim- 
ply because they preached Jesus 
Christ, and Him crucified and risen 
from the dead, and ascended into 
Heaven, and sitting with all glory 
and power and majesty and might 
at the right hand of His Father, 
God. The world felt injured by it. 
Why? Because it laid the axe at 
the root of the tree of error, of su- 
perstition and of tradition, of lack 
of faith, and unbelief. It laid the 
axe at the root of the tree of wick- 
edness, in the world, and of ig- 
norance of God and His principles, 
and the plan of life and salvation, 
and the world hated the disciples 
because of it, and they hated the 
Son of God because of it, and they 
crucified Him. They hated the dis- 
ciples because of it, and they put 
them to death. That is why they 
hate you, for the same reason, that 
is those that do hate you, those that 
have exercised their power, their 
will and their thoughts or minds 
sufficiently to be imbued with the 
(spirit of persecution and hatred 
against the light and the truth. 

What else did Joseph reveal, or 
did the Lord, rather, reveal through 
him? He revealed the identical 
Gospel, precept for precept, princi- 
ple for principle, doctrine for doc- 
trine, ordinance for ordinance, the 
exact Gospel of Jesus Christ that 
He taught Himself, and in no way 
did Joseph Smith vary in the least 
degree from the doctrines taught 
by the Son of God, even to the doc- 
trine in which the Lord Himself 
declared that if the Jews who were 
finding fault with him were the 
seed of Abraham, they would do 
the works of Abraham. So that I 
e tand here without any fear of ra- 
tional or reasonable or justifiable

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



contradiction, to say that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith revealed no 
principle to man, that was not 
taught, believed in, accepted and 
approved by the Son of God when 
He was on the earth, not one thing, 
and we can prove it — prove it by 
Scriptures, and from history. But 
we need not enter into that. What 
did he reveal? He revealed the 
Father and Son, and the Holy 
Ghost, which is a personage of spir- 
it, and not a personage of flesh and 
bone as God is, and as Jesus is. 
He revealed the doctrine that you 
must believe in God, that you must 
believe in Jesus Christ and in His 
power of redemption ; that you 
must believe, and believing, you 
must repent of your sins. Now, 
that- is a terrible crime in the eyes 
of some people, to be required to 
repent of their sins. If some men 
in the world, that have taken up 
arms against the Latter-day Saints, 
were to repent of their sins, God 
knows there would be nothing left 
of them. (Laughter.) Consequent- 
ly it is an awful crime to ask men 
to repent of their sins, but that is 
what the Lord taught through Jo- 
seph Smith ; repentance of sin, 
then baptism by immersion with 
Christ, being buried with Him in 
the water, in the liquid grave, and 
coming forth again out of the liquid 
grave in likeness of His resurrec- 
tion from death to life, baptism by 
immersion, and the baptism of the 
Holy Ghost, by the laying on of 
hands ; these are necessary for the 
salvation of the children of men. 
Joseph taught this. Who else taught 
it? Jesus taught it. . Paul, taught 
it. Peter taught it. James taught 
it. John taught it. Matthew 
and Luke and all the Apostles 
anciently taught this same doctrine, 
and left their tesitmonv on record. 



and it has been handed down to all 
subsequent generations to the pres- 
ent and we have it to look at today. 
But some people think it is a crime 
for Latter-day Saints to hold to 
such doctrines as these now, in 
these latter days. They say it is 
presumption and assumption for 
man to say he possesses authority 
to baptize for the remission of sins, 
and to confer the Holy Ghost by 
the laying on of hands. It was not 
an assumption in the days of Christ, 
nor was it a presumption on their 
part. Authority was given them, 
and they were sent out in the world 
to preach these doctrines, and bap- 
tize those who would believe ; and 
those who should believe and should 
be baptized should be saved, as the 
Apostles have said. And yet Christ 
Himself has said, "And they that 
believe not shall be damned." That 
was His word ; that was His decree 
and His law, and who will question 
the rigfht of the Redeemer of men 
to say the way in which they shall 
be saved, and the way in which they 
cannot be saved? Who shall ques- 
tion His right to say that? Jo- 
seph repeated it. We believe it. We 
have acepted it, and in this respect 
we differ from the generality of 
mankind, and they are wroth about 
it, angry about it. Then what ; was 
that all ? No ; the Lord revealed 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith that 
having been washed clean, having 
been cleansed from sin by baptism 
for the remission of sin, by one hav- 
ing authority from God to do it. 
that thereafter they were to live 
pure, chaste, holy, upright lives, and 
sin no more, if they could live with- 
out sin, or at least to do as nearly 
.that as it is possible for human cre- 
tures to do, who are possessed of 
the weaknesses that beset human 
nature. That was the doctrine of [o- 



PRESIDENT JO 

seph Smith, to live righteous lives ; 
inasmuch as you have been purified, 
inasmuch as you have been cleansed 
from sin, inasmuch as God has re- 
mitted your sins through obedi- 
ence to the ordinances of the Gos- 
pel, that you shall thereafter keep 
yourself pure and unspotted from 
the world. Anything wrong in 
that? Is jthe world injured by 
that? Any man injured by that 
procedure, or by that counsel and 
requirement? No. Well, then, 
what ? 

Then the Lord revealed the great 
principle of organization, by which 
His Church is to be governed, which 
the Lord Himself established in the 
Church, the authority of the Holy 
Priesthood, that of the High Priest- 
hood, the Apostleship, the Seven- 
ties, and the Elders, and then the 
organizations of the Lesser Priest- 
hood — the Bishops, the Priests, the 
Teachers and the Deacons — God es- 
tablished these organizations in the 
Church for the government of the 
people. What for? To oppress 
them ? No. To injure them ? No, 
a thousand times, no. What for? 
That they and their children might 
have the benefits of these organiza- 
tions for instruction, for admoni- 
tion, for guidance, for revelation, 
and for inspiration to do that which 
the Lord requires at their hands, 
that they may become perfect in 
their lives, and that they may per- 
fect the organization to which they 
belong in the Church, as the Lord 
God has revealed those things to 
us ; that thereby we may become 
stronger, more intelligent, pos- 
sessed of greater faith, of broader 
understanding of the truth, and of a 
higher conception .of God's princi- 
ples and purposes, for the existence 
of the children of men in the earth, 
and for a broader and more perfect 



*EPH F. SMITH. 7 

comprehension of the ultimate re- 
sult of obedience to the laws of God. 
Is there anything wrong about it? 
Has anybody been injured? 

Some people think that we are 
wonderfully injured, terribly 
wronged in consequence of these 
organizations. I am accused of be- 
ing tyrannical and unjust. I am 
accused of robbing and wrong- 
ing the Latter-day Saints. Well, 
you know about that. If there 
is a Latter-day Saint, or a latter- 
day sinner beneath the sun, any- 
where on earth, in hell, or any- 
where else that can point the fin- 
ger, to an act of mine, wherein they 
have sustained injury and wrong, 
God knows I will go farther than 
they could ask me to go, to make it 
right. I have never wronged any 
man, woman or child to my knowl- 
edge ; and I defy wicked men or 
good men, or women, or anybody 
else, to point to an act of mine 
wherein I have violated God's law 
of chastity. Well, why do you say 
it ? Because no man on earth knows 
it better than I do myself, and yet 
, my companions, my associates, 
those who have dwelt with me in 
secret and in public, those who 
know me can bear testimony to the 
same thing. I never used a dollar | 
belonging to the Church of Jesus , 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, that I 
did not have a legitimate right to 
use, and that, too, by the consent 
and approval of my brethren, who 
have the right to say how the funds 
of the Church shall be expended. I 
pay my tithing and offerings pre- 
cisely the same as you do, who are 
as faithful about it as I am. We 
do not all do our full duty with 
reference to this. Many of us shirk 
our responsibilities in regard to 
that, to some extent. That is, we 
feel a lack of faith in the princi-

pie and in the promise of the Lord, 
and we do not always come up to 
the full standard of the law. 

Now, the Prophet Joseph Smith 
has also revealed to the world a 
principle that has been practically 
kept hid from the foundation of the 
world. What is it? The union of 
husband and wife for time and for 
all eternity. Who knew anything 
about it? Who comprehended the 
principle ? Who understood the re- 
sponsibility that dwells with the 
union of husband and wife, till Jo- 
seph Smith revealed it in the sim- 
plicity and plainness with which he 
has revealed it to the world? The 
world hates that principle, that is, 
some do, not all of them, because a 
great many now are beginning to 
be leavened with the leaven that Jo- 
seph Smith has put into the lump 
of meal, and now you will hear both 
ministers and laity say, "Oh, we 
hope to have the privilege of seeing 
and knowing and embracing our 
wives and our children in the world 
to come." But the Lord revealed 
that principle to Joseph Smith, and 
he taught it to the world, and I 
thank God for that principle. It 
has opened my eyes. If anything 
in the world could have made me a 
better man, or a better husband, if 
such a thing is possible for me to 
be a good husband at all, it is that 
principle that the Lord has reveal- 
ed, which shows me the obligations 
that I am under to the mothers of 
my children. He has taught to us 
the' principle and the ordinance of 
the everlasting covenant, the union 
of parents and children for time 
and all eternity. What did the 
world know about it? Nothing. 
And yet the world is mad about 
these things, that is, the majority. 
I modify it, because I believe that 
there are thousands and tens of 



thousands of men in the world that 
are not identified with the Latter- 
day Saints, who actually believe 
those principles, and would accept 
them if their financial and social 
conditions in the world and their 
good name or reputation would 
only permit them to become mem- 
bers of the Church in good stand- 
ing, and not lose their favor with 
the world — they would be glad to 
do it. They believe the doctrine. 
And not only that, but the Lord re- 
vealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith the necessity of the children 
turning their hearts towards their 
fathers, and revealed to the world 
the fact that the hearts of the fath- 
ers were already turned towards 
their children in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times, and that there 
was a work most sacred and most 
important that the children must 
perform, if they have the opportu- 
nity to do it, for the redemption of 
their dead, that have died without 
the knowledge of the Gospel. God 
has revealed these things through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith to the 
world, and the world don't like 
these things. Why? Because they 
are in advance of anything that 
they are willing to accept. 

These things go beyond the mere 
belief that a man will be saved and 
exalted into the highest glory of 
God simply by saying on the gal- 
lows that he believes in the Lord 
Jesus Christ. That is a fallacy. 
Every man will be judged accord- 
ing to his works, whether they be 
good or whether they be evil, and 
that is a doctrine that was advanced 
and taught by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in plainness that cannot be 
ignored ; every man will be judged 
according to his works, whether 
they be good or whether they be 
evil. Anything short of that would

not and could not be of God, if 
( rod is just, if God is righteous, if 
God is impartial ; then this • princi- 
ple of justice is a righteous princi- 
ple, and it certainly has emanated 
from God, and not from Joseph 
Smith, nor from man. 

It would be unfair for me to oc- 
cupy much more of your time this 
morning. I thank my God for 
what is called "Mormonism." I 
thank the Lord that He has permit- 
ted me to come into the world in 
this dispensation. I am full df 
gratitude to my heavenly Father 
that He has honored me with the 
Holy Priesthood ; that He has call- 
ed me to be a witness of Him, and 
a witness of His Son Jesus Christ 
to the children of men. I thank 
God my heavenly Father that He 
has honored me in the midst of my 
brethren, that He has given to me 
their confidence and their love, and 
that I am sustained and upheld by 
them in my ministry. I feel grate- 
ful and thankful for all these 
things ; for these are better to me 
by far than any favors, praise or 
lienors the world could bestow, and 
I have no fear of the evil that is 
said of me by wicked and corrupt 
men. 

I believe in the Gospel in its 
fulness. I believe in the Holy 
.Priesthood, in its power, in its 
rightfulness to administer in the 
temples and in the waters of bap- 
tism, and in the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 
for healing of the sick, and for or- 
dinations, and for all other pur- 
poses for which the Priesthood is 
rightfully used. I bei'ieve in the 
gathering of Israel, and I believe 
that the dav will come when the 
valleys of the mountains will be- 
come too straight for the people of 
God. I believe that the time will 



come when we shad have to col- 
onize abroad, when we shall have 
to spread abroad in the earth, for 
I believe that the Lord designs that 
eventually the people that will 
name His name in righteousness, 
and that will believe in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, together 
with His works, will spread over 
the earth, and especially spread 
over this land of Joseph, which the 
Lord has preserved in which to es- 
tablish His kingdom and His 
Church in the latter days. I be- 
lieve that as much as can be, but I 
do not believe that the time has yet 
come when our people can scatter 
abroad here and there, singly or by 
twos or threes or by little com- 
panies, away off into Central 
America, away off into Southern 
Mexico, away off into the northern 
limits, and away down to the west- 
ern sea, or over onto the Atlantic 
seaboard. I do not believe the time 
has come that we can diffuse our 
strength and scatter ourselves 
abroad in the world, or colonize to 
such an extent and carry out the 
purposes of the Lord. I don't think 
that time has come. When it 
comes the Lord will make it man- 
ifest, and we will be able to do it 
too when that time comes. I be- 
lieve that an overruling providence 
compelled us to establish settle- 
ments in Canada when they were 
established there, and I believe that 
the same providence overruled and 
compelled us to establish settle- 
ments in northern Mexico at the 
time that they were established 
there. I believe that President 
Young was moved by a correct 
principle, and by prophecy and in- 
spiration when he determined that 
we should settle in Arizona and 
New Mexico in the south. I think 
that he was moved by the spirit of 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wisdom when he determined that 
we should settle at and in the vi- 
cinity of St. George, and we should 
build a temple and establish a col- 
ony there. I believe this. Why? 
Because he directed those move- 
ments by the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, and therefore it was right, 
and when the Spirit of the Lord 
moves upon His servants who pre- 
side over the Church to build col- 
onies in distant lands, it will be 
time enough for you to go, and we 
will call you to go, some of you ; 
but not till then. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, in 
conclusion I want to say, this: you 
may think perhaps that I have de- 
voted too much time in criticising, 
making illustrations between the 
doctrines of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the 
doctrines of the world. You may 
think I have been too generous in 
my use of reference, at least, to 
those who despitefully use you, 
and who persecute you, and who 
say all manner of evil against you 
falsely. You may think so, but I 
have done it merely with a view 
to showing the contrast between the 
spirit of the evil one, and the Spirit 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our 
spirit is a spirit of peace, of good 
will to ail mankind. We are seek- 
ing to build up and to establish 
righteousness in the hearts of the 
people, and I want to see you, as 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, male 
and female, so industrious, so active 
in the discharge of your duties as 
Latter-day Saints, so humble, so 
submissive to. the will of the Lord 
that you will not have time to spend 
in magnifying the weaknesses, the 
follies and the faults of your neigh- 
bors and of your fellow members 
of the Church. The Lord knows 



there is evil enough said in the 
world thoughtlessly, and without 
any particular intent to do wrong, 
but merely through the weakness 
of men to talk, talk, talk and say 
nothing — let us work and not talk. 
Let us at least try to say no evil of 
our fellow members in the Church. 
Let us cease to magnify the follies 
and the weaknesses of members in 
the Church. Let us cease to find 
fault with those that preside over 
us, the Bishop and his counselor^, 
the Presidency of the Stake, and 
the members of the High Council. 
Let us cease to find fault with in- 
dustries which are instituted in our 
midst for the purpose of giving to 
the people prosperity and advance- 
ment, a means wherewith to build 
themselves up, and with which to 
build up, or help to build up Zion. 
Let us not find fault with these 
things. 

I have a letter in my pocket to- 
day from a member, at least a for- 
mer member of the Church, who is 
now ready to leave the Church, and 
wants his name taken from the rec- 
ords, because the sugar factories 
run on Sunday, and I am the Pres- 
ident of the Utah-Idaho Sugar 
Company. My friends who are 
largely interested in this industry 
have honored me by making me the 
president of that organization. This 
man writes to me and demands that 
I shall stop the making of sugar on 
Sunday, and if I do not he wants 
his name taken from the rolls of 
the Church. Well, now, you can't 
reason with a man of that kind. 
You can argue with him, it is true, 
but you can't reason with him, for 
a man of that description has no 
reason, he is not capable of reason. 
The fact is that our sugar factories 
have brought more prosperity, 
more wealth into our country than 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



11 



any other single industry that has 
ever been established among us, 
and for nine months, at least nine 
months in the year, those sugar fac- 
tories not only keep every Sabbath 
day holy, and do no work in it, but 
they keep every other day in the 
year, or in those months, sacred, 
too, for they do not do anything; 
they just lay idle for nine months 
in the year ; but when they start, the 
juice from those beets has to run 
through miles and miles of piping, 
of tubes that are heated at a cer- 
tain temperature, that is. necessary 
to evaporate the water from the 
juice, condense the juice into a 
condition to make sugar out of it; 
and if you stop that one day, you 
ruin the whole run for at least 
twenty-four hours, and perhaps a 
great deal more. And what else? 
Why, every stockholder and every 
man who raises beets in the coun- 
try would be ruined, for the beet 
factories would have to shut up; 
they could not succeed if they did 
not, when they opened, run night 
and day, Sundays included, through 
to the end. It is the fool that saith 
in his heart, "No one has wisdom 

but me." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
we are doing the best we know 
how. Our lives, our labors, our ef- 
forts, our intentions, are like an 
open book to all who may read 
clearly, and they may run while 
they read. I want my brethren and 
sisters to do as I am trying to do, 
and I don't want to say it boast- 
fully, for T do not feel that way. I 
w ant von to pay your tithing as 
honestly as I do. That is all I will 
ask of you to do in that regard. 
And if yon will pay your fast do- 
nations for the poor, and if you will 
help to maintain your ward organ- 
izations as you should, as members 



of the Church, in which promise of 
blessing is involved in every in- 
stance, I can tell you that the world 
will have less and less power, and 
less and less reason to say — I was 
going to say evil things — but the)' 
will find, less reason and less occa- 
sion to say flattering things of us, 
because we will be that much bet- 
ter, and the better we are, the more 
the devil will rage, and the more 
bitter he will be But as President 
Young said at one time, and as re- 
peated later by President Wood- 
ruff, the more righteous and up- 
right, pure and undented, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints become, the less 
power will Satan have over them, 
for in proportion to your unity and 
uprightness, honesty, and fidelity 
to the cause in which you are en- 
gaged, in such proportion will the 
power of the adversary be weak- 
ened, and those who are seeking 
to entice your sons and daughters 
into haunts of shame, and dens of 
wickedness, that they might be de- 
filed, corrupted, wicked and "like 
the rest of" them will have less 
power over you, if you will watch 
your children better, and live bet- 
ter lives yourselves. 

God bless you, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder Edwin Tout sang as a tenor 
solo, the hymn entitled, "Oh Home 
Beloved," the words of which were 
written by Prof. Evan Stephens. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Recent persecution has increased in- 
vestigation. — Missionaries diligent, 
and the work prospering. — Immi- 
grants, and others without homes, 
advised to locate in rural districts. 
— Young members of the Church 
should attend the Church schools- 
Home products and home-made 
goods should he given preference.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Brother Stephens wrote the 
words of the beautiful song to 
which we have just listened. With 
you I have enjoyed the discourse of 
President Smith, and I hope that 
we will all remember the teachings 
he has given us. I am pleased to 
see this large congregation at the 
beginning of our conference. I be- 
lieve we will have a time of joy and 
edification while we are together, 
and I pray that the Lord will bless 
. all who shall address us, that they 
may be able to give us the word of 
life. 

Since last conference the work 
of the Lord has progressed encour- 
agingly, and we have good reports 
from all the missions. There has 
been some persecutions. Some 
have sought to stir up the people 
against the Latter-day Saints, and 
to get our Elders expelled from 
the nations in which they are la- 
boring. Even in good old Eng- 
land we have had something of 
this kind, to such a degree that one 
of the clergymen recommended 
that the Elders be carried across 
the island and dumped into the sea. 
I do not think that this opposition 
has had any harmful influence' 
against the Church. In fact, it has 
caused more inquiry to be made 
concerning the principles we believe 
in. 

Some ladies in the East who are 
much opposed to Mormonism, 
hired a man to go abroad to speak 
against us. When he got to Eng- 
land he started to teh great things. 
Much of what he said was not true, 
and it was not difficult for Presi- 
dent Clawson and the Elders to 
prove that his statements were con- 
trary to facts. When this became 
known the storm subsided there. 
Then he went to Holland, and to 
Denmark; and so much was said 



by him, and by a certain priest 
there, that Brother Andrew Jenson 
felt it went too far, and he had 
them brought before the court for 
libel. Our American man got 
away. The other one had to meet 
the issue in court, and did not want 
to take the official oath. He had to 
do this, but then he had forgotten 
everything; he did not know what 
he had said ; ■ however, when the 
testimony was read to him, he was 
forced to say yes or no. In Swe- 
den also some stir has been made, 
and for the first time since Brother 
Forsgren went to that country, in 
1850, four Elders have been noti- 
fied to leave. In Sweden the laws 
have been against us, and they have 
been able to imprison our Elders, 
but they have not expelled any of 
them from the country during the 
last sixty years. In Denmark, where 
we have perfect religious liberty, 
there has been quite a number 
forced to leave the country in 
years past on the plea that Den- 
mark has the right to say who shall 
be her guests, but not lately. Dur- 
ing this last onslaught the Danish 
press was friendly to the Elders. 
The latter declared that the accusa- ■ 
tions were not true, and so the 
press took up the matter and. de- 
manded that the charges be proved 
by those who had made them. They 
were given a chance to do this, but 
failed to bring proofs. 

The missionaries have been very 
faithful in bringing the glad mes- 
sage unto men. They are diligent ; 
they report their labors weekly and 
monthly, so that the presidents of 
the different missions know exactly 
what the brethren are doing. They 
have held a great number of meet- 
ings ; many books and tracts have 
been distributed, and many conver- 
sations held, to inform men and 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



13 



women concerning our faith and be- 
lief. Even as far as South Africa 
a little breeze of persecution has 
been felt, and some of the custom 
officers did not want to have our 
Elders land. I think, however, when 
they learn the untruths that have 
been told, they will feel to give our 
people the same liberty as arty other 
religious sect or denomination. Our 
Elders do not feel discouraged. They 
rejoice with those whom they are 
able to bring into the fold of 
Christ, and the people who join, 
rejoice in the doctrines of the Gos- 
pel, in the testimony they have re- 
ceived, and in the 'love they feel 
for one another. 

The spirit of gathering is upon 
the people, though our Elders are 
not preaching it; but when people 
join the Church they desire also to 
go to the headquarters, where they 
can iearn more concerning the ways 
of the Lord ; and for this reason, 
emigration continues, notwithstand- 
ing the Elders who' go abroad have 
been instructed to try to keep the 
people at home, to help build up 
stronger branches, and assist in the 
work of propagating the principles 
of the Gospel. 

Concerning the emigrants I want 
to say that when they come here, 
the Saints should try to do what 
they can for them. Remember that 
in most cases they have used all 
their means to come here, and they 
arrive without any money, so that 
if they do not meet acquaintances, 
and nobody receives them, they feel 
tempted and discouraged. This is 
the very time when the friendly 
hand of the brethren should be ex- 
tended unto them to make them feei' 
that they have indeed arrived in 
Zion. It takes very little to do this. 
Thev are mostly people who are of 
the laboring class. All they desire 



is to get employment. I would ad- 
vise the emigrants not to try to 
make a start in the large cities, but 
to get out into the settlements. They 
may not be able to get the class of 
work they have been accustomed to 
in the factories and the different 
employments they used to be en- 
gaged in, but in going out to the 
settlements they will be more likely 
to get a home of their own and in 
some degree become independent. 

I rather deprecate this flocking 
to the large cities and leaving the 
rural districts. I believe that per- 
sons can sooner make themselves 
comfortable homes out in the rurai 
districts than they can in the large 
cities. I allude to such as have no 
regular profession or trade. For 
them to locate in the cities means 
that they will probably always live 
from hand to mouth, while out in 
the country there is still lands to 
be taken up, and homes to make. 

Some think when they come here 
and see the comfortable homes of 
many of. their brethren, that if they 
had only come here in the early 
times they would have had a much 
better chance to obtain property. 
Well, you who came here before 
the advent of the railroad, as was 
alluded to yesterday, know that, to 
build up a settlement meant much 
work and many hardships. There 
was a great deal of labor to do to 
bring about the conditions of to- 
day. There were roads to make in- 
to the canyons, fields to be culti- 
vated, fences to be built, school- 
houses and meeting houses to be 
erected, a great deal of labor to be 
done in common before we saw 
things as they are seen today in our 
midst. Those who come today, 
though they may not be' able to 
take up lands in the neighborhood 
of large cities as cheaply as former- 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ly, still they come into a country 
where much of the hard labor has 
been done, and they can join with 
their friends, their brethren and sis- 
ters, in enjoying the fruits of the 
labors of the pioneers. But there 
are places — new places where they 
can go. There is the Uintah coun- 
try, where there is plenty of land 
and water ; and to our young men 
who have no homes, I would say: 
go to such places. Try to get land. 
Land will grow in value, and the 
land-owner is the one that is more 
inclined to be patriotic, both to his 
country and his Church. Try to 
get places of your own, where you 
can feel "This is my home. No 
landlord can tell me to leave. I 
am independent, though it is but a 
small cabin." Young man, don't be 
satisfied to spend your young life 
in day wage earning. Of course, 
there are many that must do this, 
many are adapted for it, and it is 
perhaps the life that they like most 
and would make them the happiest ; 
but to our young men generally, 
who have initiative of their own, I 
would say, strike out for yourselves, 
and though it means hard labor, 
and in many cases deprivation of 
things you could have in the city, 
yet by and by, what you are doing 
will come back to you with more 
than interest, and you will be 
thankful that you have started for 
yourselves. This is a week day, 
and we can talk about temporal af- 
fairs, I suppose. 

I want to say a word in regard 
to our Church schools. The Church 
expends a great deal of means for 
Church school education. It is not 
simply to give our young men and 
women an education. We have 
snlendid state institutions, and now 
high schools are springing up ev- 
erywhere, where a good secular ed- 



ucation can- be obtained. Our 
Church schools are not running in 
opposition to any of these. Of 
course, it may be that some of the 
courses are running parallel. That 
can not be entirely avoided. But 
in our Church schools we are teach- 
ing the principles of the Gospel ; 
our religion, and this can not be 
done in the high schools or state 
institutions. It is necessary that 
the latter be kept free from reli- 
gious teaching, because nobody 
would like to send children to an 
institution where they would be 
taught a religion not believed in 
by their parents, and hence our 
state institutions and common 
schools are kept free from religious 
instruction. The Latter-day Saints, 
however, feel that of all teaching, 
the teaching that leads to God and 
gives the children a knowledge of 
why they are here upon the earth, 
and what they must do to obtain 
eternal salvation, is of the greatest 
importance. This is what we are 
trying to give in the Church 
schools. We are glad that our peo- 
ple are in favor of education, and 
that they make so many sacrifices 
to have their children educated. I 
hope that our children are taking 
advantage of these opportunities, 
and that they are striving for an 
education for education's sake, and 
not with the idea in mind that by 
being educated they can make 
money without labor, and that labor 
is beneath them. We want our 
children taught that all labor is 
honorable, and that the hand ought 
to be trained just as well as the 
brain. This will make the best cit- 
izens. And again, brethren and 
sisters, remember that in the 
Church schools we are at liberty to 
teach the principles of religion and 
morality, and to instill in the hearts 



PRESIDENT ANTH OX H. LUXD. 



15 



of our young men and women love 
of God and the things pertaining 
to Him. I would like to encourage 
our people to take advantage of the 
Church school system at the side of 
the others, and any man who is go- 
ing on a mission — and nearly all 
our young men will have that priv- 
ilege — ought to have an opportu- 
nity of going' to a Church school. 
We find that when such go abroad 
they are better qualified for the 
work to which they have been 
called. 

A word to the people of the rural 
districts, our farmers. I want to 
put them in mind of what thev can 
do. When I hear of so many things 
being imported into our state that 
could be raised here, I think that 
we are not using the wisdom that 
God has given us. We send our 
products east and west, and' have 
them packed and returned to us, 
and we buy them here back again. 
Such a course needs no comment. 
I hope that ouf industries may mul- 
tiply, that those who understand 
manufacturing will take hold and 
>itart such enterprises in our midst. 
We have too few of that kind. And 
then our farmers, instead of devot- 
ing' themselves entirely to raising 
wheat or grain/ ought to try to 
turn their attention to raising other 
things that will pay. Those who 
live where there are sugar factories 
are blessed in having the opportu- 
nity of raising sugar beets, which 
bring the ready cash. When beet- 
raising was first tried, it was 
thought that it would not pay, but 
we find that in all the districts 
where there are sugar factories, the 
people are thankful that they have 
the oonortunitv of raising beets. 
People living' in other districts too 
far ' from the factories think that 
they cannot raise beets to advan- 



tage, but this is a mistake. I had .a 
talk with the editor of the "Indiana 
Farmer," and he informed me that 
the farmers in Indiana have learned 
that by raising sugar beets and us- 
ing them on the farm, they can 
make every ton into nine or ten 
dollars; especially by feeding them 
to the hogs. And here let me say 
that we import too much bacon. We 
send hundreds of thousands of dol- 
lars out of the state to buy bacon 
and hams, which we could raise at 
home just as well, and we would 
know better what kind of meat it is 
we get. I am not encouraging peo- 
ple to eat pork, but they ought to 
raise* hogs enough to furnish the 
state with all the ham and bacon 
required. And I could mention 
many different things that we im- 
port, and which we could produce 
ourselves. Canneries ought to be 
established wherever we can raise 
the meat, fruit and vegetables for 
the canneries, so that we could ex- 
port instead of import such things. 
Now, time will not allow me to talk 
more on this subject, but it is an 
important one and our people ought 
to give it some thought. We want 
to raise wheat and grains, the dif- 
ferent cereals, but other things 
ought to be combined with it, be- 
cause mixed husbandry is found 
to be the most profitable. 

Before I close I would like to 
say to all of vou, let us remember 
the saying of Jesus : "Seek first 
the kingdom of God and His right- 
eousness;" and to seek His king- 
dom is not alone to find it and to do 
the first things required, but it 
means to continue to keep His com- 
mandments, to work for the up- 
building of His kingdom, and to 
exercise that righteousness which 
belongs to Him. Let us show to 
the world that we are earnest and 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sincere in that which we have re- 
ceived. Let it not be a matter of 
indifference to us, but every one 
seek to be full of the Spirit of the 
Lord, feel its burning influence 
within us, and ever be ready to do 
what we can to further the pur- 
poses of the Lord in this our pro- 
bation. God bless you all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH E SMITH. 

President Taft's address heartily en- 
dorsed. 

I do not know how many of the 
Latter-day Saints present at this 
meeting were not here yesterday, 
when we had the the pleasure and 
profit of listening to the President 
of the United States, addressing the 
people from this stand on the great 
subject of Universal Peace. I hope 
the discourse that the President de- 
livered here yesterday may be pub- 
lished in all the newspapers that 
every man and woman who reads 
the papers in the state may have the 
privilege of reading the sentiments 
expressed by our nation's Execu- 
tive. I would like to say to you, 
that I sat her and listened with deep 
interest to his words, and T en- 
dorse without reserve every senti- 
ment that he so ably and so elo- 
quently expressed with reference to 
the great principle and glorious 
hope of "peace on earth and good 
will to man." 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the cleat- 
blue sky 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to flee. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Mel- 
vin J. Ballard. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

PREST. JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Establishment of this Government, 
and restoration of the Gospel, cause* 
for rejoicing. — The Latter-day 
Church organization continues in its 
perfected form. — Priesthood and 
Saints fulfilling sacred duties. 

I desire that you will give me the 
benefit of your faith and prayers., 
that the time which I occupy may be 
profitable to you as well as to my- 
self. T rejoice in the fact that there 
are present upon this occasion all of 
the First Presidency of the Church, 
that there are present all of the 
Council of Apostles except Brother 
Clawson, who is engaged earnestly 
and fully in his duty of helping to 
proclaim the Gospel among .the na- 
tions of the world. I am pleased 
that the Seven Presidents of Sev-

enties are all in the city and are 
present excepting one of them, who 
may have been delayed or detained 
in the performance of duties resting 
upon him. The Patriarch of the 
Church, and I believe the Presid- 
ing Bishopric in their entirety are 
here today. 

I rejoiced very much this morn- 
ing in the telling Gospel discourse 
delivered to us, following his words 
of welcome, by the President of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, to hear his voice de- 
claring the mercies of our Heaven- 
ly Father, and bearing witness of 
the truth as established in the day 
and age in which we live, and ex- 
pounding and explaining to us 
those primary doctrines of the Gos- 
pel, and reasoning with us upon 
those advanced principles of the 
Gospel revealed in this dispensation, 
with which the world at large has 
not been acquainted. It was a 
pleasure to me to hear his testimony 
to the mission and ministry of Jesus 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world, 
and to hear him declare in words of 
soberness the fact that the same 
Gospel, which was introduced by 
Him in that former dispensation, 
has been renewed to us in the dis- 
pensation in which we live, and 
that man was privileged to gaze up- 
on the face of Jesus Christ and oi 
God, our Heavenly Father. 

The impress of the spirit of the 
work of the Almighty should glad- 
den the heart of the aged who have 
left fatherland, connections and re- 
lations, and national ties, that they 
might be engaged in that wonder- 
ful work, having heard that mes- 
sage, "Come out of her, O ye my 
people, that ye receive not of her 
sins, and that ye partake not of her 
plagues ;" that the trials and trib- 
ulations that would beset the na- 



tions would surely come in the due 
time of the Lord, and that as the 
warning cry went forth, declaring 
the glad message of the visitation 
of our Father in heaven, and His 
introduction of that heavenly mes- 
senger, the Savior of the world, 
and that the human family should 
again hear, in language clear and 
explicit, the doctrines announced by 
the Redeemer of the world. Joy 
abounded in my soul in the re-dec- 
laration in the presence of this vast 
congregation, of these truths, and 
of the nature of that work which lay 
upon the shoulders of the men and 
women to whom that warning had 
come, and into whose soul the im- 
press of the Spirit from on high 
had found place and lodgment, and 
had led them to gather in this land, 
this land dedicated under our Fath- 
er in heaven for the accomplish- 
ment of His great purpose, the up- 
lift and blessing of the human race. 

I rejoice in the declaration that 
came through the fathers called up- 
on to establish this republic, in the 
Declaration of Independence, ut- 
tered and promulgated and ex- 
pounded among the people of this 
land, the principles involved in the 
Constitution of the United States, 
and the opportunities that were to 
be placed within the reach of the 
children of men, to believe in God 
and to obey the laws and ordin- 
ances of the Gospel, that no one 
should molest nor make them 
afraid. While in the application of 
the great fundamental law, that 
opened the doors of liberty to the 
human race, it has been in the keep- 
ing of the American people, the 
law itself remains untarnished. 
Some, in their misapprehension, or 
over-zeal in regard to the regulation 
and care of their fellows, have fail- 
ed to appreciate the fact that it was 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the design of providence to guard 
the consciences of men and open 
up to them the great privilege of re- 
ligious freedom. They are at liber- 
ty to accept the doctrines of Budd- 
ha if they choose, or to believe in 
the mission and ministry of Mo- 
hammed, or to regard and honor 
the laws and views presented in the 
Koran, or in the doctrines an- 
nounced by Moses, following the 
Jewish theories and ideas ; they also 
who should believe in Jesus Christ 
in these latter days, and literally ac- 
cept His doctrines, should with 
their fellow men enjoy their right 
to those laws, and live in harmony 
with the rules and principles set 
forth in the doctrines announced in 
this latter time, even as they were 
announced in that former day. 

My brothers and my sisters, I re- 
joice when I think of the complete- 
ness of the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints ; when I remember that 
the promise was given in the com- 
mencement that this work had been 
divinely established and would 
never again be taken from the 
earth; that this organization, with 
its prophets, its Apostles, its Pas- 
tors, its Teachers and its Evange- 
lists, should remain unbroken. I 
remember that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith himself ministered under 
these rules and regulations, and 
that, after his passing there came 
to the front that grand man who led 
us to these mountains, with the 
band of other grand men, among 
the truest and best that ever breath- 
ed the breath of life, that came 
with him and continued the work, 
maintaining each principle and doc- 
trine, announcing the glad message 
that had been entrusted to their 
watchcare. Having themselves been 
in the mission field, declaring the 



truth and pointing the way of life 
to mankind, raising that appeal 
which led you to gather into your 
mountain homes, "Come out of her, 

ye my children, that ye receive 
not of her sins, and that ye partake 
not of her plagues." 

There has been a continuance of 
the Church organization in an un- 
broken phalanx, with its Presidency 
holding the keys and rights of that 
presidency ; the Council of the 
Apostles, complete and perfect, stal- 
wart and true men, devoted to the 
cause, utilizing their talents in ev- 
ery way to extend the good work, 
and free themselves from the sa- 
ared responsibility that God our 
Father placed upon their shoulders. 

1 rejoice when I remember that 
their associates, the Council of Sev- 
enty, devoted and true, have kept 
their faces in the direction of the 
extension of this great work; and 
that the great body of High Priests. 
Seventies, and Elders, in their en- 
tirety, have kept aflame in their 
hearts the message entrusted to 
their watch-care, and have been 
true in the fulfillment of the duties 
that have been imposed upon them. 

As I gaze into the faces of this 
body of men and women, and rec- 
oginze their worth, understanding 
the message they have in hand, the 
sacredness of the obligation that 
rests upon them, I pray my God 
that nothing shall ever cau?e one 
of them to waver from the truth. 
Their faces aflame with goodness 
and gladness, with the teachings 
and instructions and complete or- 
ganization, from the Presidency, 
the Presiding Patriarch, the Apos- 
tles, the First Council of ^"ventv, 
the Hiq-h Priests, the Patriarchs 
throughout the Church, the preat 
bodv of Seventies, the great bodv 
of Elders, they recognize the fact 



PRESIDENT JOHN HENRY SMITH.

that this world is unconquered by 
the word of God. They have been 
sent into the world to fulfil that 
mission of conquering the world by 
the declaration of the truth, by the 
advice and counsel of righteous- 
ness, by themselves walking so 
clean and free from the trammels 
of crime that they can look at the 
best people in the world, wherever 
they may be found, and declare, "I 
know that God lives 1 ; I know that 
Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the 
world; I know He is the veritable 
Son of God, that He has opened the 
door to the human race, and the 
doctrines essential to the salvation 
of mankind are the doctrines an- 
nounced by Himself. Thou shalt 
"believe in God the Eternal Father ; 
thou shalt believe in the Redeemer 
of the world, and thou shalt witness 
thy belief by burial in baptism, and 
in the confirmation and receiving of 
the Holy Ghost, realizing that this 
message of morality, and the ob- 
servance of these ordinances, rests 
upon every man and every woman 
in the land, to receive and apply 
them in their lives." 

This body of men standing at 
the head of this work in a solid 
phalanx should faever turn their 
backs to their fellow men, but with 
their faces looking to mankind, 
should proclaim unto them, "This 
is the way, walk ye in it." Christ 
is the Redeemer of the world. The 
theories and fallacies of men in re- 
gard to this matter, seeking to make 
a myth of Him, are not true. He 
is the Christ, He is the Way and 
the- Life. He is the Redeemer of 
the race, and should be magnified 
and sustained by every Christian in 
the universe. Standing before you, 
T declare my absolute knowledge 
that He is the Son of God ; that He 
is my Redeemer and your Redeem- 



er, and that by Him, and through 
Him, and of Him the race will be 
reclaimed, and in no other way. 

May heaven's blessings abound in 
your hearts. May you have the 
power to impress upon your sons 
and daughters that faith which will 
lead them along the lines of right- 
eousness, and away from the 
schemes and devices of designing 
and misleading spirits, that the 
wicked may not be sucessful in en- 
tangling them in the meshes of 
crime. May you be enabled to say, 
as you point to the head of this 
work, "There stands the man 
God selected ; here is the Church 
organization Jesus established, un- 
broken from the day it was fixe' 1 
by the Prophet of the Lord, and 
God said it never would be taken 
from the earth or given to another 
people." It will never be given to 
this little organization, or that little 
party withdrawing from this work. 
Here stands this organization true 
to God, true to the principles He 
has announced, true to every re- 
quirement placed upon their shoul- 
ders, as men have ever been true to 
the obligations placed upon them. 

My brothers and my sisters, I 
am happy to be with you. I rejoice 
in the knowledge of the truth of 
this work, and bear my witness, in 
connection with my brethren, of its 
place and purpose and mission in 
the world, and to say that the men 
who speak of its overthrow, its 
displacement, its failure to accom- 
plish its mission, are dreaming 
myths, for this work will not fail. 
God has decreed its success, and it 
is to become the joy of the race. 
Amen.

peace have they that love the Lord." 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Saints give abundant evidence of love of 
God and mankind. — "Mormon" mis- 
sionaries' self-denial rewarded by- 
God's approval.— Divine truth of their 
message proven by their virtuous lives. 
Love of money a cause of loss of faith. 
— Knowledge imparted by the Holy 
Spirit makes men steadfast. 

It is always a pleasure to meet 
with the Latter-day Saints in stake 
and general conferences. I rejoice 
in the very splendid turnout that we 
have had during the meetings on 
this occasion. I do not remember 
to have ever seen so large a gather- 
ing at an opening session of any of 
our conferences as we had here this 
morning. It shows to me the faith 
of the Latter-day Saints, and is an 
evidence of their desire to hear the 
word of the Lord through the gen- 
eral authorities of the Church, who 
as a rule address the people assem- 
bled on these occasions. I earnestly 
desire that the time which I may 
occupy here this afternoon may be 
for our mutual benefit. 

I rejoice in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and in the knowledge which 
I possess of the divinity of the work 
in which we are engaged. It is ever 
my earnest prayer that I may re- 
main firm, steadfast and faithful, 
that I may not turn to the right nor 
to the left, but may walk in the 
straight and narrow path that leads 
to life eternal. This prayer which 
I offer for myself I also offer daily 
for all the Latter-day Saints; and 
I constantly pray that the honest the 
world over may see and comprehend 
the truth.. I pray also that those of 
us who have received a knowledge 
of the truth may live according to 
the teachings of the Savior, that we 
may so order our lives that other 
men, seeing our good deeds, may 



glorify God, and that they may be 
led to the truth. 

We find in the 22nd chapter of 
St. Matthew the following: 

But when "the Pharisees had heard that 
he had put the Sadducees to silence, they 
were gathered together. 

Then one of them, which was a lawyer, 
asked him a question, tempting him, 
and saying, 

Master, which is the great command- 
ment in the law? 

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 

This is the first and great command- 
ment. 

And the second is like unto it, Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 

On these two commandments hang all 
the law and the prophets. 

The longer I live, the more I 
study the gospel, the more I come 
in contact with men, the more forci- 
bly am I impressed with the truth 
of the sayings of our Savior in the 
words that I have just read to you. 
If we did in every deed love the 
Lord our God with all our heart, 
with all our mind, with all our soul, 
there would be no need of urging 
from time to time upon the people 
the necessity of keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord" It would 
be a pleasure to them to serve God 
and keep His commandments. We 
are told that where a man's treasure 
is, there will his heart be also, and if 
we loved the Lord with all our 
heart and mind and soul, serving 
Him would be the great object of 
our lives, and the treasure we would 
work to gain would be His love. If 
we followed that second command- 
ment, to love our neighbor as our- 
self, there would be no need of 
bishon's or High Council trials ; our 
difficulties would all be settled amic- 
ably, if we really and truly loved 
our neighbor. It would be' almost 
a waste of time to appeal to the peo-

pie for donations, to urge them to be tural heart of man, and the labor 
liberal, to. be generous, to strive for which they are performing is a la- 
the benefit and welfare of their fel- bor of love, without hope of reward 
lo ws. i ; . whatever in this life. They have a 

While we as a people do not fully hope of reward, of course, from God 
come up to the requirements of the our Heavenly Father who rewards 
first great commandment, nor com- us by a rich outpouring of His Holy 
pletely meet the requirements of the Spirit whenever we are engaged in

you here today, I believe that of all This labor which is beino- per - 
people upon the face of the earth, formed is costing on an average in 
there is no other people who love the neighborhood of, if not fully 
the Lord their God as do the Latter- twenty dollars per month per capita 
day Saints. There is no other peo- for each and every one of those two

love of God by their acts, by the sac- gospel, forty thousand dollars a

which they strive to serve God and men and their families, who are

there is no other people to be found not exaggerating at all to say that 
on the earth that compare to the these men would average, if 'they 
Latter-day Saints in these respects, were at home laboring for' the ma- 
I believe also that there is no other terial things of this world at least 
people to be found where there is as sixty dollars a month per capita for 
much of brotherly love, of real har- their time ; therefore we find that 
mony and good will, and a desire to the Latter-day Saints, by giving

among the Latter-day Saints. Not ulgate this gospel of Jesus Christ

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



was the worst of the lot, because he 
established this terrible gospel called 
"Mormonism." The Savior said, 
"By their fruits ye shall know 
them," and this is the infallible rule 
that you and I and everybody else 
can lay down, by which to judge 
men — by their fruits. By the fruits 
of love of our fellows, we stand 
supreme above all the world in 
preaching this gospel. Freely we 
have received, and freely we give. 
This gospel of Jesus Christ, which 
the world says is a delusion, a snare 
and a fraud, to each and every man 
who goes out to proclaim it, and 
who lives an upright and virtuous 
life, it brings peace, it brings joy, 
it brings happiness unspeakable. 
In standing up and proclaiming that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the 
true and the living God, there are 
hundreds, yes, there are tens of 
thousands of men who have gone 
out to preach this gospel, and who 
can bear witness that God their 
Heavenly Father, by the inspiration 
of His Spirit, blessed them and gave 
them utterance in proclaiming the 
fact that Joseph Smith was a proph- 
et of God, far beyond their natural 
ability of expression. They are able 
to bear witness that peace and joy 
ofttimes filled their very beings in 
testifying to the divinity of the mis- 
sion of this man as a prophet of the 
true and living God ; and that, after 
they have sat down, they have wept 
for joy because of the blessings of 
the Lord which have come to them 
while thus testifying. 

It fell to my happy lot to labor for 
three years in Great Britain, and 
other parts of Europe, as the Pres- 
ident of the European Mission. I 
came in contact with thirteen hun- 
dred Elders during that time, and 
I bear witness to you that those 
boys were sweet, that they were 



clean in their persons, in their 
thoughts, in their acts, that they 
were in very deed representatives of 
the gospel of Christ ; that they were 
leading God-like and Christ-like 
lives. I bear witness to you that 
every one of them was ready and 
willing to testify, and did testify 
time and time again in my hearing, 
that under the influence of the sweet 
spirit that comes from our Heavenly 
Father, that they had had times of 
joy beyond their ability to express, 
in proclaiming this gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Do you mean to tell me 
that the fruits of the gospel, that 
brings joy and peace and happiness 
unspeakable to those that are pro- 
claiming it, that are honest, that are 
upright, that are diligent, that are 
true, — do you mean to tell me that if 
that gospel was vile and wicked that 
it would fill the heart to overflowing 
with gratitude in those that are pro- 
claiming it? Why, it is an absurd- 
ity- 

I have often remarked, in public 
and in private, that, to me/"one"of 
the greatest of all the great testi- 
monies of the divinity of the work- 
in which you and I are engaged, is 
the fact that no man, in all the 
eighty years that this gospel has 
been proclaimed, has ever returned 
to us from a mission and announced 
that he has found the truth in some 
other part of the world. It is not 
to be found. Ministers warn their 
congregations against the Elders. 
They warn their congregations in 
the world against reading our tracts, 
against studying our literature, or 
listening, or having anything to do 
with the "Mormons." Did I warn 
one single, solitary Elder out of the 
thirteen hundred that I labored 
with, against the gospel that any 
man might have to give him? No. 
I warned him against doing evil. I 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



23 



warned him to shun wine and wom- 
en, in the language of the late Pres- 
ident Wilford Woodruff,! "as he 
would the gates of hell." I warned 
him to live sweet and clean and 
pure, and to bow down and pray 
God, day by day, for the guidance 
of His Holy Spirit. I told him to 
study the Bible, to study the teach-, 
ings of the Savior and of His Apos-' 
ties, and proclaim the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the people. I said, 
keep yourself sweet and clean and 
pure, and study the gospel, and 
God will bless you; and God did 
bless them. Do you mean to tell me 
for eighty years God would allow 
men to go on, year after year, living 
virtuous, upright, honest lives, pro- 
claiming a gospel that was not true, 
and that He would never bring one 
of those honest souls to a knowl- 
edge of the true gospel? What is 
the result on the other hand ? Hun- 
dreds, yea, thousands have been 
pricked in their hearts, and by the 
inspiration of the Spirit, and the 
revelations of God to them, they 
have received a knowledge of the 
divinity of the work in which we 
are engaged. They have received 
the witness of the Holy Spirit to 
them, satisfying their souls, satis- 
fying their very beings, causing 
them to cry out in joy that they 
know that God lives, that they know 
Jesus is the Christ, that they know 
Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the 
true and living God. No man on 
earth can say that he knows that 
what they say is not true. He may 
not believe their testimony, but he 
cannot rob them of the knowledge 
that they have. I may proclaim that 
I love my family, and a man may 
say, "I don't believe it," but that 
does not change the knowledge that 
I have that I do love them. When 
a man has received the witness of 



the Holy Spirit, when a man has 
received the knowledge that this 
gospel is true, and he knows it, and 
he proclaims it, the whole world, 
not believing, cannot change the 
knowledge that he has. The Lat- 
ter-day Saint possesses this knowl- 
edge, and it is this knowledge that 
. they have of the divinity of this 
work that enables them to live 
nearer to the first great command- 
ment, than any other people, to love 
the Lord with all our heart. 

The average man that did not 
have a knowledge of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ would never be an hon- 
est tithe-payer ; he would not have 
the courage to obey that law. The 
natural selfishness of man is so 
great that he would not and could 
not do it. Why, we love money to 
such an extent that many people will 
sell their very souls for it. The great 
criterion of success in the world is 
that men can make money, but I 
want to say to you Latter-day 
Saints that to do this is not true 
success. As a man grows and in- 
creases in the things of this world, 
if he is not careful, he will lose the 
Spirit of the Lord, and he will set 
his heart upon the things of this 
world, and if he loses the Spirit of 
the Lord, and fails to be honest with 
God in the payment of his tithes, as 
strictly and honestly as he would 
account to a partner if he were en- 
gaged in business, that man will 
lessen his strength, will lessen his 
power, will lessen the testimony of 
the Spirit of God within his soul. 
There is no question of it in my 
mind. We must be honest with the 
Lord. The great trouble is that 
there are many people who, as they 
grow and increase in the things of 
this world, set their hearts upon 
them and lose the Spirit of the Lord. 
Therefore, that which is counted by 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world as success is failure; be- 
cause if a man starts out for a prize 
and he fails to secure it after labor- 
ing nearly a lifetime for that prize, 
certainly his life has been a failure. 
I know many individuals who, 
when they made small sums of 
money, were absolutely honest with 
the Lord, and paid one-tenth of it; 
but when they made large sums of- 
money they paid all the way from 
One per cent, instead of ten, up to 
two or three per cent. What is the 
matter? Why, the appetite for 
money grows upon a man, increases 
and strengthens unless he is careful, 
just as much as the appetite for 
whiskey, and ' it gets possession of 
him, and he loves the money instead 
of loving it only for the good that 
he can do with it. He does not esti- 
mate properly the value of things. 
I once wrote a little sentiment for 
the' Improvement Era, which was 
published .fourteen years ago, as fol- 
lows : 

Not he who merely succeeds in mak- 
ing a fortune, and in so doing blunts 
the natural affections of the heart, and 
chases therefrom the love of his fellows, 
can be said to be truly successful : but 
he who so lives that those who know 
him best shall love him most; and that 
God, who knows not only his 'deeds, but 
also the inmost sentiments of his heart, 
Shall love him; of such an one, only — • 
notwithstanding he may die in poverty 
— can it be said indeed and of a truth, 
"he should be crowned with the wreath 
of success." 

Speaking of the wrong estimate 
of things calls to my mind a little 
incident that I have related many 
times in public, of a good old sister, 
a faithful Latter-day Saint up in 
Scotland. I had a very fine valise 
presented to me by some of my busi- 
ness associates before I went on a 
mission. It was an alligator hide 



valise, and it had on it those great 
big lumps, you know, that the alli- 
gators grow on their backs, about as 
hard as steel. This good sister, who 
had been used to seeing "bags," as 
they call them over there, that were 
very smooth, and that cost six or 
eight shillings, said, "Oh, I do wish 
somebody would give Brother Grant 
•a decent, respectable looking bag. 
What a pity it is that he has to carry 
such an awful looking bag." If 
somebody had given me a valise 
costing two or three dollars, she 
would have thought I had a treas- 
ure. I don't know what this valise 
cost that my friends gave me, be- 
cause you know they say you must 
never look a gift horse in the mouth, 
and I didn't ask the price, but I 
did price one before this was given 
to me, that was not as nice, and the 
price was thiry dollars, so I sup- 
pose this one I had cost over thirty 
dollars; but the good sister, I am 
sure, would not have given six shil- 
lings for it. She did not know its 
value. The next conference I at- 
tended was out at Sunderland, and 
there is one little section of the rail- 
road that runs out there that carried 
only third-class passengers. In the 
compartment where I was there 
were some first class passen- 
gers, who had changed to third 
at the Junction. You know, people 
ask why "Mormons" always travel 
third class, and the answer is "Be- 
cause there is no fourth class." I 
leaned back in the seat, closed my 
eyes, and the gentlemen who had 
been traveling first class thought 
I was asleep. One of them said, 
"I am sure that gentleman is an 
American." The other one said, 
"How do you know?" "Oh, I am 
positive of it, I am sure of it." The 
other one said, "I am not. How do

you know ?" And he said, "Nobody 
but an American would waste so 
much money on a bag." So you see 
he knew the value. 

The world thinks like the good 
old sister that we are wasting our 
money, because we 'will not ex- 
change a forty or fifty dollar valise 
for one worth half a dozen shillings. 
They do not know the truth. They 
do not realize the value of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. They do not 
know, for instance, the healing 
power of Almighty God that is in 
this Church. They do not know 
that there are men living who, but 
for the power of God, would not be 
here. I say to you that I know that 
I myself am a living witness of the 
healing power of Almighty God; 
that there are others now sitting 
upon this stand who would not be 
here today but for the restoration 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, with 
all the power, with all the authority, 
with all the graces, with all the gifts 
that were ever enjoyed by former- 
day saints. 

This is God's truth that you and 
I have embraced. It is the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and may He 
help us, that we may in very deed 
follow the admonition of the 
Savior, and so live that other men, 
seeing our good deeds, shall glorify 
God and be led to the truth, is my 
prayer and desire, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



At the close of his discourse, 
Elder Grant, by request of Presi- 
dent Smith, read a telegram from 
John W. Young, of New York 
City, in which Brother Young ex- 
pressed sentiments of high esteem 
for President Smith and his asso- 
ciates, and deep interest in the wel- 
fare of the Church. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 

Good resulting from malicious articles 
recently published in magazines.— 
Change manifest in attitude of intelli- 
gent people concerning 'the Church.— 
Pleasure in defending "Mormon" doc- 
trines. — Ward teachers should more 
frequently visit homes of the Saints. 
— The great modern sin of immorality. 
— Saving of wheat recommended. 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
suffering this afternoon from a se- 
vere headache, and I hope that while 
I occupy the short time this after- 
noon allotted to me, that I may for- 
get it, and that I may have a por- 
tion of God's Spirit to be with me. 
I hope to be lead to testify to His 
goodness, not only to myself, but to 
His people in general. 

"I am not ashamed of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, for it is 
the power of God unto salvation." 
I know as well as I live that, if the 
world is to be redeemed and man- 
kind saVed, it can only be through 
the power of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. The longer I live and the 
more I see of this world the more 
positive I am that God is with His 
people, and blessing them in every 
way promised through obedience to 
the gospel. He is blessing you spir- 
itually and temporally. I know of 
no people in all the world upon 
whom the blessings of our Heaven- 
ly Father are so bounteously bes- 
towed. He is also blessing us with 
increased faith, and I believe that 
He is blessing us with greater 
knowledge of things divine. 

While we see on all hands oppo- 
sition to God's work, criticisms 
against His servants, falsehoods 
expressed, both from pulpit and 
press, I desire to testify to you that, 
as far as the people of God are con- 
cerned, they are growing and in- 
creasing in knowledge, in numbers,

in faith, and, I believe, in the con- 
fidence and respect of honest men 
and honest women throughout all 
the world. I recognize that the re- 
cent magazine articles published 
against us are having their effect 
both for good and evil. I am sure 
they are having the effect of preju- 
dicing unthinking people against 
the work of God and His people, 
while on the other hand I am sure 
they are having the effect of call- 
ing attention of thoughtful men to 
the fact that they are written by 
untruthful men, and the statements 
made are false upon their face. I 
have tried to figure out the effect 
these malicious, false, lying articles 
have had upon the Church, and I 
have come to the conclusion that 
among the millions of persons that 
have read the article*, a great many 
have had their prejudicies increased, 
and, on a basis of one hundred of 
these, most of them unthinking peo- 
ple, there are at least, fifty others 
who detect the purpose and object 
of the articles and their absolute 
falsehood. This being true, a feel- 
ing of sympathy lias been created 
in the hearts of the latter towards 
a people so wickedly maligned ; and 
I have also noted that they are the 
men and the women who think. 
They are the intelligent class of 
people; and I believe the result in 
the end will be for the good of 
the work of God. 

I have faith that God will over- 
rule all things for the advancement 
of His work. I am confident that 
if we are true to Him and keep His 
commandments that it will be but a 
short time until we will be known 
for good throughout the world. For 
eighty years we have had bitter op- 
position. For eighty years the press 
of the country has been filled with 
anti-Mormon articles. Eighty years 



is a short time, a mere passing mo- 
ment, compared with eternity, so 
there is no reason for discourage- 
ment. I believe that it will not be 
many years before the honest peo- 
ple of the world, as well as the press 
and magazines, will be looking for 
and publishing the good and beau- 
tiful things found in the great plan 
of life and salvation as revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
instead of, as at present, seeking for 
everything that can cast a reflection 
upon the organization and members 
of the Church. 

I have taken great pleasure, and 
shall always do so, in explaining 
the articles of our faith, our ideas 
of this life and the life to come, 
our faith in God and His Son Jesus 
Christ, our form of baptism and its 
object, our belief in the laying on of 
hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, as well as all the principles 
and ordinances of the gospel as re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I testify to you that when 
explaining these great truths and es- 
pecially our belief as to the here- 
after, in the life to come, where 
we expect to meet our loved ones 
and know them, they appeal to many 
men and women. People are cu- 
rious to know what our belief is on 
all questions that modern Christian- 
ity teaches, and some express them- 
selves as not having known that we 
believed in Jesus Christ. It has al- 
ways given me pleasure in testify- 
ing to our belief in Jesus Christ and 
Him crucified; our belief in God 
the Eternal Father ; our belief in 
the literal resurrection of Jesus 
Christ, and that He is the actual Son 
of God. There is life,, there is truth 
and power in "Mormonism." No 
man need be ashamed of its prin- 
ciples and its mission, nor need he 
at any time or in any place offer 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



27 



any excuse for the doctrines that 
have been revealed by God, and His 
Son Jesus Christ, in this dispensa- 
tion. 

My brethren and sisters, our 
greatest danger is within, and not 
without. Have we a testimony that 
God lives, and are we living so as 
to maintain it? Are we consistent 
and loyal supporters of the laws of 
God — if so we need fear no opposi- 
tion. I think that, taken as a whole, 
no people on earth comes nearer 
living correctly, yet we must not 
close our eyes to the fact that we 
have failings and shortcomings. I 
believe that one of the weaknesses 
in our Church work today is the 
neglect of ward teachers to regular- 
ly visit the homes of our people. It 
is true that we are all teachers, but 
there are certain men selected in 
every ward whose special duty it is 
to visit the homes of members of the 
Church. It is the teacher's duty to 
call at every home, no matter what 
position the head of the house oc- 
cupies, whether it be the President 
of the Church, a member of the 
quorum of the Twelve, the presi- 
dent of a stake, bishop of a ward, 
or the humblest member in the 
ward. As soon as the teacher en- 
ters the door of a home, if it is the 
home of a Latter-day Saint, the 
family should be called together for 
instruction. The teacher then pre- 
sides, and it is his duty to expound 
the principles of the gospel, to in- 
quire as to the faith of each member 
of the family ; whether they, are at- 
tending to their prayers, whether 
there is anything in their home life 
contrary to the teachings of the 
Church and the Spirit of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. From the reports we 
receive, there are homes that are 
not visited once a year. This is not 
as God intended. I plead with the 



bishopric of every ward where such 
a condition exists, to rectify it as 
quickly as possible. Instruct your 
teachers to visit every home at least 
once a month, and oftener if neces 
sary. I believe that if this is done 
there will be a reformation in the 
lives of many. 

As I scan newspaper reports from 
all parts of the world, and as I see 
the conditions of society in differ- 
ent sections of this country, I am 
convinced that one of the greatest 
evils now sapping the spiritual and 
physical strength of the people of 
the world is the evil of immorality. 
I take pleasure in testifying, for I 
know it is true, that the Latter- 
day Saints are as clean and virtuous 
a people as live on the earth. But, 
fathers and mothers, I call your at- 
tention to the fact that we are not 
entirely free, as a people, from this 
curse. There is a responsibility up- 
on you fathers and you mothers to 
see that every child that God has 
given you is reared in the atmos- 
phere of virtue, and that your 
daughters and your sons, for the 
Latter-day Saints have no double 
standard of virtue, are guarded and 
protected from every evil or evil 
influence. Every boy and every girl 
in the Church should grow to man- 
hood or womanhood clean and free 
from immorality. Fathers and 
mothers, I beseech you not to let 
your girls walk the streets at night, 
bareheaded and unprotected. I wish 
I had the power to reach the ear 
and heart of every mother and im- 
press upon her the evil of this dis- 
graceful practice, the temptations 
accompanying it. Many may think 
there is no danger, but I know there 
is. No good can come from it, but 
evil and shame may be the result. 
The Bible, the Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants, all of the 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



works of the Church teach us the 
value of a virtuous life, and the evils 
following an unclean life. I trust 
the time will come, through the 
teachings of the Church, and the 
watchfulness of the parents, when 
we can say there is no immorality 
among us. There is work for the 
teachers, for the Priesthood, for 
every father and every mother in 
Israel, as long as there is one case 
-of immorality in all the Church. 
We might say, as one of old, that 
• "I am not my brother's keeper," but 
I say to every Latter-day Saint that 
I believe it is your duty, if you see 
a young boy or girl going wrong, 
to call the attention of the parent 
or guardian to it. It may be that 
you will receive a rebuff, but you 
will have the satisfaction of having 
done your duty. If the rebuff is 
given, I believe the time will come 
that the parent giving it will be sor- 
ry for it. 

Nothing can happen to the 
Church, or in the Church, but 
what it affects all the members 
of the Church. No evil can 
be inflicted upon any part of it 
without affecting the whole body. 
I pray of you, when you see tempta- 
tions and vice all around you, to 
guard well the children that God 
has*given you. I thank God for the 
teachings of my parents. I thank 
Him for the example which they 
set me, and I desire to say to all 
Israel that it was the teachings and 
the example that I received from 
my parents that has kept me clean, 
as far as the vice of immorality is 
concerned. I have said many, many 
times, to men of the world that if I 
should violate the law of chastity, I 
would leave the "Mormon" Church, 
or I would humble myself and seek 
God's forgiveness. 

In connection with my brethren 



who have spoken during this con- 
ference, I have a testimony that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that 
this is His work, and that it will 
never be taken from the earth 
again ; that we are God's people and 
that, as we strive to do His will, so 
will He bless and protect us. This 
is my testimony to the Latter-day 
Saints. It is my testimony to all 
the world, and God grant that you 
may have the same testimony. May 
you never waver in your duty or 
your loyalty to God's work, or to 
any requirement the principles of 
the gospel impose upon you. A 
testimony that God lives is one of 
the peculiarities of "Mormonism;" 
it is one of the promises of God to 
those that seek Him, and it is one 
the world cannot comprehend, nor 
can any person comprehend it until 
he has placed himself in a position 
to receive it, by complying with the 
requirements made of 'him by God. 

I am pleased to see the people 
prospering as they are, and I am 
more than pleased to see through- 
out this State bounteous crops and 
harvests, and let me ask you, my 
brethren and sisters, to take care of 
them. Do not waste any portion of 
these bounties, but save all you can, 
for, in these days of unrest — and we 
see it on all hands— no man can tell 
what a year will bring forth. It 
would not surprise me to see the 
time come when the people will suf- 
fer for want of sufficient breadstuff. 
I hope^the people will have at least 
a year's wheat supply on hand, 
rather than, as many are today, be- 
ing in debt for the wheat consumed 
during the year past. So presidents 
of stakes, bishops of wards, leading 
brethren, wherever you give advice, 
encourage the people to take care 
of all the bounties that God is be- 
stowing upon them, and I know if

you will do it it will be better for 
every man, and every family. 

May God give us strength to do 
our duty. May He give us a de- 
termination to live by every word 
that proceedeth from His mouth, 
and be loyal and true to His work, 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ.' 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 



Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able- 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, 
Feed us till the Savior comes.

SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, Oct. 
7th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
has said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder John 
L. Herrick. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that "Prophet and 
Seer"— 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Faith is only one principle of salvation. 
— The Church prepares its members 
for eternal life. — Possession of the 
Holy Spirit the strength of the Saints. 
— All who hold the Priesthood should 
be teachers and exemplars of right- 
eousness. — Acceptance of Priesthood 
implies willingness to perform duties 
thereof. — Duty of prayer incumbent on 
all. — Loyalty inculcated. — Exhortation 
to be pure in heart, and remarkable 
for good works. 

My dear brethren and sisters, I 
trust that the same good spirit that 
attended the speakers yesterday may 
be with us this morning, and during 
all the sessions of the conference. 
We were greatly pleased with the 



remarks of our brethren yesterday, 
and no doubt we were reminded 
again of the doctrines that have 
brought us together, and that, with 
the spirit that has accompanied 
them,' has so thoroughly established 
this people. I see before me, I am 
persuaded, some of the choicest and 
most faithful of the Latter-day 
Saints ; men and women who have 
been thoroughly tried, well experi- 
enced in the plan of life and salva- 
tion, the people that are generally 
with us on such occasions. Through 
my mind, yesterday, passed the 
thought, how precious it would be if 
all the Saints could gather with us. 
if we could all be together, and all 
have the privilege of enjoying the 
same spirit that we enjoy on such 
occasions. That is not possible, but 
it impresses me with the importance 
of the responsibility that rests upon 
the brethren and sisters who do 
gather together, and can be here, 
and will always be here, while they 
live; the same class, that is, the 
same percentage of the people from 
all the stakes of Zion, and repre- 
sentatives from the missions, and 
brothers and sisters who bear re- 
sponsibility (m the Church. We 
heard yesterday some of the ex- 
cellencies of the gospel of salvation, 
the principles of truth that commend 
themselves to all honest people 
whose ears and hearts are open to 
receive the word, and without 
which principles we are advised that 
' men cannot be saved. We all re- 
member that expression of the 
Apostle Paul, in regard to the 
principle of faith, that I have 
thought has unwittingly, deluded 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



the Christian people generally in the 
world, for he declared that "With- 
out faith it is impossible to please 
God." Naturally, it has been taken 
that with faith the Lord may be 
pleased, and that too with faith 
alone. But we have come to un- 
derstand that faith, genuine living 
faith produces the very important 
principle of repentance, and that 
without repentance it is not possible 
to please God. Without baptism for 
the remission of sins it is not pos- 
sible to please Him. Without the 
gift of the Holy Ghost it is not pos- 
sible to please Him. But, with these 
great and superior, and primary 
principles in the gospel of life and 
salvation, we have discovered and 
have proven in our lives that men 
may be saved. 

I thought, while the brethren 
were talking yesterday, that it would 
be a good thing to bring a little 
scripture to your attention — these 
brethren — Stake Presidencies, High 
Councilors, Bishops and counselors, 
High Priests and Seventies, these 
men who are looked upon and .con- 
sidered the teachers among the peo- 
ple—and while I do this I trust that 
your hearts will be touched, I trust 
that your souls will be so opened by 
the presence of the Spirit* of the 
Lord that you will not forget this 
scripture. It is homely, somewhat, 
but very important. It is a scripture 
that was given eighty-one and one- 
half years ago yesterday, on the 6th 
of April, 1830, and I am persuaded 
that it has not had quite the weight 
in our hearts that it should have, 
hence I desire to draw it to your at- 
tention, or your attention to it, and 
have it impressed upon your minds, 
for the conditions that are laid down 
here, that entitle the children of God 
to that saving ordinance of baptism, 
is of greater importance, I believe, 



than we have attached to it. I be- 
lieve that the brethren, the Elders in 
the world, have not been quite as 
careful in this regard, nor the breth- 
ren at home, the bishops who hold 
the key to open the door for every- 
body who comes into the Church. 
The bishop is the master of the sit- 
uation in his ward, and everybody in 
his ward in the Church coming into 
the Church, born of Latter-day 
Saint parents, and so forth, all these . 
are under the direct care and super- 
vision of the bishop of the ward. I 
want us to discover the fact that this 
Church, with its order, its organiza- 
tion, perfection and authority, is 
most admirably planned and ar- 
ranged by our Heavenly Father for 
the salvation of the children of men, 
for their training, their bringing up, 
and for preparing us for salvation 
in His kingdom; not only intended 
for our entrance into the kingdom, 
but to maintain our standing, fel- 
lowship, and growth therein, so that, 
though we are very enthusiastic, 
very devout and faithful in the be- 
ginning, that we shall continue in 
that condition until the finish of our 
contract with the Lord ; that is to 
the end, and the end is when we 
die; that is the end of our obliga- 
tion, taking us finally into the pres- 
ence of God, with our sins forgiven 
and blotted out. We are not there 
yet, but we will get there very soon, 
one at a time, or a few at a time, as 
we came into this world. This is 
the scripture that I desire to im- 
press upon your hearts, and that 
when we go home we can impress it 
on the hearts of those who could 
not come, officials and others, so 
that this may ring in the hearts and 
souls of Latter-day Saints. It is in , 
regard to the manner of baptism, 
and in regard to the conditions that 
should obtain, and that must obtain, 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in order for us to receive the bless- 
ings of salvation that we seek, all 
those who humble themselves before 
God, and no one else can have this 
blessing. 

"All those who humble themselves be- 
fore God, and desire to be baptized and 
come forth with broken hearts and con- 
trite spirits, and witness before the 
Church that they have truly repented of 
all their sins" — that is not a part of 
them, but the whole of them, — "and are 
willing to take upon them the name of 
'Jesus Christ, having a determination to 
serve him to the end" — and I have told 
you what the end is — serve Him to the 
end of this probation, this mortal life 
of ours, — "and truly manifest" — that is, 
without any deception — "truly manifest 
by their works that they have received 
of the Spirit of Christ unto the remis- 
sion of their sins, shall be received 
by baptism into His Church." 

And all those who do not thus 
come before the Lord, humbling 
themselves, and with these condi- 
tions, shall not be received into this 
Church. Now, if there have been 
any received into this Church that 
have not met those conditions, they 
are at fault and they have not 
pleased the Lord. Their faith has 
not been genuine, for genuine faith 
produces genuine repentance, genu- 
ine baptism, a profitable and accept- 
able baptism unto the Lord, and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the lay- 
ing on of hands. Now, that is a 
splendid condition for people to be 
brought into when they enter this 
Church, and the Lord understood 
that the day this Church was or- 
ganized, just as well as we begin 
to understand it today. When we 
have thus received tne gospel, when 
we" have received that measure of 
genuine faith, when we have ob- 
tained that gift from God, repent- 
• ance that worketh reformation and 
that puts us in condition that our 
sins may be washed away — for sins 
are not washed away without genu- 



ine faith and repentance — and bap- 
tism is not acceptable to the Lord 
unless that same faith and repent- 
ance be attained to by those who 
would be baptized, then water bap- 
tism may follow, and then baptism 
of fire and the Holy Ghost. This is 
the secret — right here lies the secret,, 
my brethren and sisters, of the 
strength of this Church. It is the 
individual testimony and witness of 
the Holy Ghost in the hearts of the 
people, that establishes every man 
and every women in righteousness, 
in purity, in faith, in morality, in 
uprightness and undefiled. How 
beautiful that is ! What splendid 
doctrines ! What great improve- 
ment that does make upon the na- 
tural, mortal, fallen man ; and the 
fruit of it is to be discovered among 
the Latter-day Saints today in good 
measure. There is room, of course, 
for more to be good, faithful and 
true than we have today, and there 
will be no doubt in the future. 

Now, the Lord is pleased with 
you. He is pleased with us so far 
as we have entered this Church 
properly, so far as we have re- 
mained in the Church, in His work, 
in obedience, in humility, and in 
faith and devotion to Him, as we 
have entered it. Every man who 
has so come into the Church has 
that witness and testimony abiding 
in his heart of the Father, the wit- 
ness of the Father and the Son, for 
the Lord has declared Himself unto 
us ; He has come unto us and borne 
witness to us of the doctrines that 
are presented, that they are true. 
Latter-day Saints know that they 
are true. They know it, having 
demonstrated and proven them to 
be true, and having the witness of 
the Spirit of the Lord, which in- 
spires their hearts and brings joy 
and happiness to their souls, and in 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



33 



that is the strength of the Church. 
There are no standing armies ; 
there is no compulsion; nothing of 
a physical nature brought to bear 
upon the Latter-day Saints ; no man 
is compelled to take a position; no 
man is compelled take an ordina- 
tion ; no man is compelled to labor 
after he has received these favors; 
but they are instructed, counseled, 
labored with, they are persuaded, 
and generally converted to the im- 
portance of maintaining their stand- 
ing and fellowship, that has 
prompted them to come into the 
kingdom and to maintain these con- 
ditions while they live. We feel 
their importance, and we recognize 
them among the brethren at home 
and abroad. 

We are very anxious that this 
same spirit and desirable condition 
shall be not only maintained by the 
presiding brethren, officers in the 
Church, and those who stand at the 
head of departments in Zion, and at 
the head of missions in the field, but 
that the Elders — and all are Elders 
who bear the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood ; the Apostle is an Elder and 
should be addressed as an Elder in- 
stead of an Apostle ; you should say 
"Elder Lyman," and the same to 
these brethren who hold the Apos- 
tleship. The Apostleship is a sacred 
term that ought not to be used in 
common parlance as we use it to- 
day. It was not in former times, in 
the davs of President Young.. It 
was after his death that Elders that 
are known as the Apostles in the 
Church were spoken of, or spoke of 
themselves as "Apostles." They are 
the Elders, the chief Elders of the 
Church. They are the Elders who 
hold the kevs of the kingdom, and 
who bear the responsibility of the 
kingdom at home and abroad, under 
the direction of the First Presidency 



of the Church, and we are Elders, 
and so are all who bear the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood ; and it happens 
today that all the bishops in the 
Church bear the Melchizedek 
Priesthood, every one of them. 

Then we have the Lesser Priest- 
hood, the Aaronic Priesthood — the 
Priests and the Teachers and the 
Deacons. We heard a little yester- 
day, — I am not sure but I think it 
was Elder Smoot, who dropped the 
thought that we are all teachers. 
If you remember and will read this 
scripture, it is right here, I need not 
give much time to speak in regard 
to it, but you can study it for your- 
selves, in the twentieth section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, you 
will find that the duties of a teacher 
are shared by the deacon. He is to 
work with the teacher, if occasion 
requires; and I have discovered, I 
think, in my ministry among the 
people, that the occasion always re- 
quires that the deacon should share 
with the teacher; and the teacher's 
duty is to watch over the Church al- 
ways, and to be with and strengthen 
the Church. Now, if Elder Smoot 
was correct in that assertion that we 
are all teachers, — 'and I am willing 
to grant that — I don't know of any 
more important and valuable call- 
ing or appointment than that of a 
teacher. I understand that our 
Savior was the greatest of all 
teachers, and it was not too small 
a w r ork for Him to pay attention 
to the teaching of the word of the 
Lord, and training the people, and 
so it should be from the greatest to 
the least in this Church ; and the 
greater men are, the greater respon- 
sibility and the more they are ele- 
vated before the people, the greater 
teachers they should be, and of all 
teachers, the bishops of the wards 
should be the greatest teachers in 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the wards. They should be men, 
as Paul happened, accidentally, 
maybe, to say on one occasion when 
he was talking to Timothy, in his 
letter he said that the bishop, among 
other things, after telling that he 
should be blameless, the bishop 
should be without fault ; he should 
be a perfect man ; just do every- 
thing exactly right ; but the injunc- 
tion that I refer to is that the bishop 
should be "apt to teach/' given to 
teaching. It should be natural for 
him to be a teacher, for if there be 
any fault with the teachers, they are 
his teachers ; he has selected them ; 
he has blessed them and set them 
apart; and if they be faulty and do 
not know exactly how to" do things, 
the reproach be upon the bishop of 
the ward. 

Another scripture I want to draw 
your attention to, and I want to ex- 
pound a little scripture and extend a 
little scripture, as I have had occa- 
sion to remark in some conferences, 
to expound a scripture and extend 
it. Now, parents in Zion who fail 
to teach their children faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ, repentance and 
baptism, the laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, the sin 
be upon the heads of the parents. 
Now, may I extend that scripture a 
little, so that it will not only take the 
father and mother of the children, 
but will take particularly the father 
of the ward, and say that the father 
who fails to teach his children how 
to teach, and fails to give them in- 
struction, and fails to train them and 
bring them up in the way they 
should go, that when they are old 
they are competent teachers, — the 
-bishop who fails to do this, with the 
assistance of his counselors who are 
chosen High Priests, and should be 
just as good as the bishop — the re- 
p roach be upon their heads. The 



responsibility that rests upon us, my 
brethren, who bear the Priesthood — 
for when men are ordained to the 
Priesthood, the Lesser Priesthood 
and the Greater Priesthood, when 
they receive these offices in the 
Priesthood it is indicative, it makes 
plain to the Church and to the 
world that these men are called with 
divine authority, that responsibility 
rests upon them, that they are ex- 
pected to be workers. 

Do you know now, I want to 
extend our practice a little farther 
than we have been doing. When 
we want a president of a stake, we 
want him for work ; and his coun- 
selors the same. When we want a 
high councilor, we want him for 
work. When we want a bishop, we 
want him for work. When we want 
his counselor, we want him for 
work. When we want a man to 
preside over a mission, abroad in 
the world, we want him to work. 
When we want an Elder to go into 
the world, we want him because we 
have work there. There is employ- 
ment in preaching the gospel. We 
want him to go out because there is 
something to do. Now, we have 
dropped somewhat into the fashion 
of ordaining Seventies and of or- 
daining Elders and ordaining Pa- 
triarchs ; and the brethren don't go 
to work. Now, suppose when a 
brother is ordained an Apostle, or 
is ordained a Patriarch, he does 
not go to work. Why, he does not 
get the spirit of his calling. It is 
the man who takes hold of his min- 
istry and the responsibility that is 
put upon him, who gets the spirit 
of his calling. It is so with a Sev- 
enty. He is ordained a Seventy 
and that is all — just ordained a 
Seventy, or he is just ordained an 
Elder, or just ordained a Priest, or 
Teacher or Deacon, or any of the 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



35 



offices in the Church, and he does 
not go to work ; there isn't employ- 
ment for him; the bishop has not 
so trained the material in his ward 
that when they are ordained to any 
position in the Priesthood, that 
there is employment. A man should 
work. It is indicative that he should 
work. He should be a prayerful 
man, at least when he receives the 
Priesthood. No man in this Church 
is entitled to receive divine author- 
ity from the Lord, and then forget 
Him. No man is entitled to receive 
the Priesthood in this Church, and 
stay at home on the Sabbath Day, 
and not partake of the .sacrament. 
No man is entitled to have the 
Priesthood who does not remember 
the Lord and bow his knee before 
Him in the season thereof ; and the 
Lord has said in a scripture that I 
may refer to. He that doth not 
pray, doth not say his prayers, re- 
member his prayers before the Lord, 
in the season thereof, shall be had 
in remembrance. If you remember, 
that is what the Lord said to Zion, 
the children of Zion, and we are 
among them. That is what He said 
to the inhabitants of Zion, a com- 
mandment that He gave, that those 
who do not pray before the Lord in 
the season thereof, shall be had in 
remembrance ; that is, shall be re- 
membered by the bishop or by the 
judg-e of my people, and he is the 
judge of the people. 

The bishop is the judge of every 
man. woman and child in his ward, 
and he is responsible ; that is, he is 
resoonsible to take care o.f them, 
and to mind his own business in his 
ward, just as the oresident of the 
st?Ve must mind his own business 
in his stake of Zion, and let nothing 
escape him. Now, the bishop is 
under obligation to instruct every 
man that he ordains, everv man that 



he allows to be ordained and directs 
to be ordained, every man that is 
called to any position of responsi- 
bility in his ward, it is the business 
of that bishop, as a good father 
of the brethren, and fathers of the 
people, to instruct that brother if 
he receives the office of an Elder in 
order to go and be married in the 
Temple, to bear the Melchizedek 
Priesthood, — it is the business of 
that bishop to give instructions such 
as he will never forget in his life, 
tell him that it is his business to go 
home from the Temple, with his 
wife sealed to him for time and eter- 
nity, and be a faithful worker at 
home. He can always find some- 
thing to do. He has the home to 
regulate. He has the order of prayer 
to regulate at his own hearth. It is 
his duty to offer prayer in his home. 

These Latter-day Saints pray, 
they pray in the morning and they 
pray at night, and that is the sea- 
son of prayer. And then they pray 
secretly. What do they pray for? 
Why, I have had brethren say, "If 
we were prayed for and remem- 
bered as you brethren are, it would 
be different. We all pray for Pres- 
ident Smith and for the-General Au- 
thorities. We pray for all these 
quorums of the Priesthood, all these 
presiding brethren. If we had the 
benefit of prayers,- we could be good 
people as you are." They think we 
are remarkably good, and we are 
pretty good. • Well, now, what about 
our prayers? I want to know if 
there is one person in this Church 
that prays more faithfully for Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith than he prays 
for you. I would like you to bear 
that in mind, my brethren and sis- 
ters who are here, that there is not 
a family so separated from the 
ward, and so far out on the range 
and in the mountains and canyons, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and neglected and overlooked and 
forgotten, almost, maybe, by bish- 
ops of the wards, — President Smith 
never forgets to pray for that fam- 
ily or that man ; he never forgets to 
pray for that woman, that mother in 
the family ; never forgets to pray 
for the smallest, simplest child in 
the family. We pray every morn- 
ing for you. We prayed this morn- 
ing, I did, I prayed for you, and I 
presume you prayed for me. I 
prayed for all ; my heart was opened 
so I could pray for all Latter-day 
Sjaints. I prayed for our govern- 
ment, our country. I thank the Lord 
for the strength of the country, of 
these great United States. Oh, what 
blessings they have vouchsafed to 
us, that we have been preserved, and 
that the Church is established, and 
so settled and fixed and protected 
by the wall of strength that God 
has established in these United 
States. How thankful we ought to 
be. We remember our neighbors; 
we pray for them ; we pray for their 
conversion, and we set good exam- 
ples before them. 

We do not patronize the saloons, 
we do not patronize any of these 
evils that are about us. You know 
that we come to you with good in 
your stakes of Zion. There is not a 
presidency of a stake that we have 
not blessed and set apart and helped 
to select, not a high councilor. 
There has not been a Relief So- 
ciety, not a Mutual Improvement 
Association organized, not a quo- 
rum organized, not a mission es- 
tablished in any part of the earth, 
but what the presiding officials have 
gone out with blessings, and with 
instruction in the hands of the ser- 
vants of God who bear the Holy 
Priesthood. And then we do not 
forget them. We pray for them. 
We pray for them when they go, 



we pray for them when they re- 
turn, we pray for them while they 
are abroad. I hope the Latter-day 
Saints do pray for us. I hope you 
pray for us at least as well as We 
pray for you ; for I pray always for 
you, for every family in this Church. 
There is not sickness in any home 
but what we pray for the sick, as 
well as those whose names some- 
times are handed in, that is to pray 
for especially. We have those re- 
quests by letter, sometimes — Please 
remember my wife, my daughter or 
son — and we pray for them. We 
call upon the Lord to notice that 
there is sickness in a home, that 
there is calamity or trouble or dis- 
tress or sorrow somewhere, and we 
want it relieved. We call upon the 
Lord. That is what we do; and 
then we behave pretty well. 

We are sober men, moral men, we 
are not corrupt and defiled. We 
don't come to you with corrupt doc- 
trines and principles to defile you. 
Have you been so instructed? Has 
any bishop, any elder, any seventy, 
any department of the Church been 
injured because we have carried 
corruption and trouble to them? 
No, we have been good to you, 
good to you all the time, and you 
have fed us and been good to us and 
kind to us, and slept us, but we have 
never trespassed upon you. We 
have never been inclined to trespass 
upon you, but to defend you and 
help you and instruct you, and re- 
prove you if it were necessary, if 
you were in transgression and sin. 
We have tried to have you help us, 
and you have helped us. There is 
wonderful improvement made dur- 
ing the last decade or more, two or 
three decades, so> far as my acquain- 
tance has been with you brethren 
here, you leading, presiding breth- 
ren. I have been with you on all 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



37 



occasions and under all conditions 
and circumstances, when we have 
had our troubles and little conten- 
tions, and little divisions, and so 
forth, and we have always given 
you good advice and set you good 
examples. These brethren here on 
this stand, whom you know, you 
know our hearts just as well as we 
know our own, and you are wit- 
nesses ; the people are our witnesses 
throughout this Church. They know 
we have been faithful and true to 
them, and that we have taught them 
to be loyal — loyal to our govern- 
ment, loyal to the government of 
God, and loyal to the government of 
our great country, for it is the 
Lord's country. He has established 
it and established this people. He 
has gathered the people, not only 
the Latter-day Saints, but He has 
gathered the oppressed and the 
downtrodden and the sorrowful 
and the humble and meek of the 
earth. God has gathered them to 
the land of Zion, the land of the 
pure in heart, the land where the 
pure in heart should dwell, and 
where all who dwell should be pure 
in heart. 

Now, we want the Latter-day 
Saints to benefit, we want you to 
profit, we want you to take home 
to your wards and to your stakes of 
Zion the instructions and spirit of 
this conference, you brethren who 
preside, and that you shall attend 
to your own business ; for the stakes 
of Zion are so extended, the wards 
are so numerous, and the General 
Authorities sitting in this little 
square here, — there are not many 
more than a score — upon whom rest 
the responsibilities of caring for the 
whole people at home and abroad, 
and to the preaching of the gospel 
throughout the world. And we need 
your help ; we want you to be good ; 



we want you to be faithful ; we want 
you to be sober ; we want you to be 
moral in principle, in spirit, in body ; 
we want you to be clean and pure 
and faithful and humble. We want 
you to be humble, yourselves, before 
God. We want you to remain hum- 
ble before God. We want you to 
repent of all your sins. We want you 
to take upon yourselves the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. We want 
you to serve Him and honor Him. 
Having the commandments and ob- 
serving them it will be 'positive evi- 
dence that you love the Lord, and 
if you do this the Lord will come 
unto you. He will love you, and 
the Father will love you and love 
us, and He will come unto us and 
manifest Himself unto us. He will 
not manifest Himself unto those 
who do not remember Him, and do 
not keep His commandments. Those 
who remember Him and love Him 
will keep His commandments, and 
the keeping of His commandments 
is positive evidence that they love 
Him. 

We want our brethren and sis- 
ters, we want the Latter-day Saints 
to love the Lord, and to honor Him 
and to serve Him with full purpose 
of heart, for we want to be saved ; 
we want you to be saved ; we want 
to be together when we get on the 
other side, under good and favor- 
able conditions. We will be better 
men there. We may not think there 
will be much change, but we will 
be a very great deal better men on 
the other side than we are here. 
Our children will love us better ; the 
wife will love the husband better, 
and our neighbors will love us bet- 
ter, because the faults and failings 
and weaknesses that were mani- 
fested here will disappear. We dis- 
cover them every day. They will 
disappear. They are of the earth 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



earthy, and we will act like men on 
the other side. We will be better. 
We will live and repent, and our re- 
pentance that we maintain through 
this life will have its genuine fruit 
of success and of relief from sin 
and transgression, and our minds 
will be freed from any weight of sin 
or trouble that we had in this life. 

We are going through a world of 
sin and distress and danger, yet it 
is a good world. I don't want to 
say a word against it, and I calcu- 
late to stay "here as long as I can ; 
but it is a world of danger, and 
trial and tribulation and hardship 
for men and women, but it is pos- 
sible for us to endure, it is possible 
for us to serve the Lord; it is pos- 
sible for us to do what is right, and 
nothing that is wrong. It is not 
necessary for us to do wrong, and 
we want to quit doing wrong and 
work righteousness and serve the 
Lord. Let the bishops then, the 
presiding brethren in the wards, re- 
member these things. I talk to them 
because there are more of them here 
than I will see again until next 
April. I will not meet many of 
them between now and then, pos- 
sibly, and we want the bishops to 
go into their wards, and we want 
them to take care of the people that 
are at large, the people who are 
roaming, and who are not gathered 
together, and who do not gather 
together in the ward meetings, who 
are not heard and seen there. Bring 
them together, hunt them up, try 
to know every family and to know 
what is the matter with every fam- 
ily, and draw their attention to the 
fact that if they do not partake of 
the sacrament, and do so worthily, 
it is positive evidence that they do 
not remember the Lord. If a man 
remembers the Lord he will keep 
His commandments, and we do keep 



them just to the measure of our love 
of God. You know where you are 
at, without me trying to find out. I 
could not if I tried, possibly, but you 
know. If you are serving the Lord 
and keeping His commandments 
perfectly and fully, that is positive 
evidence you love the Lord. If we 
do not do these things, we do not 
love the Lord as we should, 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. I testify to 
you that this is the Lord's work. 
Our Heavenly Father, by His Son 
Jesus Christ, has established this 
work, and kingdom. He brought 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and made 
him a Prophet, and inspired and 
qualified him, and sustained him to 
his death, to the shedding of his 
blood. Our Father in Heaven did 
this through His Son Jesus Christ, 
and established this Church, and it 
is growing, it is spreading, it is 
gaining strength. But are there not 
some who are weakening? Yes, I 
suppose so. Some will be weaken- 
ing, some will die off and pass away, 
but the Church will endure, and 
never grow less than it is today. It 
will grow stronger. 

I have another thought that was 
expressed by one of the brethren 
here. You remember it. You 
heard it yesterday, that in a little 
while, the virtues of the Latter-day 
Saints will begin to be advertised 
and shed abroad among the people^ 
of the earth as a remarkable people. 
We will be a remarkable people, for 
we will be a sober people, a moral 
people, an upright people, people 
who are reliable and trusted in busi- 
ness matters and everything else; 
reliable in politics and government 
and governmental affairs.' We 
won't rob the treasury, or rob any- 
body, or do anybody harm, but be 
conscientious, upright, good and re- 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

liable. If government authority is 
trusted in our hands, or in the hands 
of any of our brethren, it will be 
safe and there will not be a de- 
faulter. It is a reproach to a peo- 
ple who have a defaulter. It is a 
reproach to us when we fall into sin. 
We want always to be free of these 
things, and stand in the presence of 
the Lord approved of Him. 

I thank the Lord that 'we have 
been pretty good. I have no bad 
things to say about my brethren. I 
love them with all my Iieart. They 
are just as tender to me as my own 
dear children, just exactly, and I 
know my brethren, I know their 
hearts, every one of them, and you 
know them. They are just as true 
as steel, faithful, ready to live al- 
ways in the service of God; then 
we will die when we can't help it. 
but we don't intend to die as long- 
as we can help it. We intend to 
stay here -and assist in the building 
up of the kingdom. We want to be 
servants of God. We desire to 
serve Him and assist in the ac- 
complishment of His purposes 
in the earth. We desire to live a 
long time and bless the people. We 
desire to extend our hands over all 
Israel, and to bless them, and our 
neighbors included in Zion ; for we 
are greatly mixed up at the present 
time, and there are very many good 
precious people among us, good, 
honest and moral people, to say 
nothing about those that are other- 
wise, either with us or on the out- 
side. 

Let the Latter-day Saints serve 
God, and love Him, and honor Him, 
and keep His commandments, and 
be united in listening to counsel and 
walking uprightly before the Lord, 
and deal justly and properly on all 
occasions, and in regard to all mat- 
ters of every nature. That is our 



exhortation, and that is the doctrine 
we have been carrying to the peo- 
ple. We have . gone for the good 
and virtuous in the world, and called 
men to repentance. We do not 
want men who do not repent. This 
is the gospel of repentance that is 
entrusted to us, which shall be 
preached to every creature, and he 
that believeth and is baptized shall 
be saved, and he that believeth not, 
but rejecteth the message God 
has sent, will be condemned. It can't 
be helped. Be pure and upright and 
conscientious, and love the Lord, 
and He will come to you with His 
Spirit and sustain you now and for- 
ever, which I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Qualifications of successful Teachers 
designated. — Detailed statement of 
Teachers' duties. — Proper deportment 
of family when Teachers visit. — The 
faithful strengthened, the slothful en- 
couraged to good works, by Teachers. 

^The reference of the brethren to 
the question of teaching among the 
Latter-day Saints lias given me a 
desire to speak a few words upon 
the same subject. It has come 
prominently before the attention of 
the General Authorities of the 
Church that there is a great lack of 
teaching among the stakes of Zion, 
and in the wards of the Church, a 
very great neglect of duty on the 
part of those who are called to be 
teachers among the people, and, as 
a consequence, the Saints in their 
families are not being visited and 
instructed as the Lord designed that 
thev should be. 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In the organization of the 
Church, the Lord has provided offi- 
cers in the Holy Priesthood, and 
has defined their duties. We have 
been informed that it is the teacher's 
duty to be a watchman over the 
Church, to strengthen them, and to 
see that there is no iniquity in the 
Church, neither backbiting nor evil 
speaking, and to see that the people 
attend to their family duties and 
their Church duties. Brethren, we 
who are called to be teachers, many 
of us at least, have not as fully as 
we should have done, performed 
the labor allotted unto us. 

Now, there is a certain prepara- 
tion that should be had on the part 
of a teacher prior to his entering in- 
to the homes of the Saints to instruct 
them in their family and religious 
duties. In the first place, he should 
be duly^ ordained to the holy 
Priesthood, and called and set apart 
to labor among the people. Now, 
authority is not all that is necessary 
in order to be a successful teacher. 
Pie must have knowledge also, for 
except he have knowledge concern- 
ing the things of God, how can he 
impart instruction unto the Latter- 
day Saints? Therefore, the brother 
holding the Priesthood and desig- 
nated as a teacher among the peo- 
ple ,should have a knowledge of the 
truth. Pie should be well informed 
upon the principles of the gospel. 
He should be familiar with the doc- 
trines of life and salvation. He 
should be a student of the Scrip- 
tures. Pie should understand the 
word of the Lord, and be familiar 
with His commandments. And when 
he has this knowledge, then he 
should have a desire in his heart 
to impart of this knowledge unto 
the people, and to see that the peo- 
ple are instruc ted in the gospel, and 
are obedient thereto. Before a 



teacher attempts to go into the 
homes of the people on any special 
visit, he should make his going a 
matter of prayer before the Lord.. 
As has been suggested by President 
Lyman, he should go before the 
Lord and ask His blessings upon 
his labors, that he might enjoy the 
inspiration of the Spirit, that by the 
Spirit he may be directed in what- 
soever things he should say and do. 

When he has made this preparat- 
ion, and is qualified through knowl- 
edge and testimony, then when he 
enters into the homes of the Saints 
he can make inquiry of them con- 
cerning their condition and their 
conduct and their standing as mem- 
bers of the Church. The authority 
of the Priesthood gives him the 
right to ask questions of the family 
as to their diligence in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord, as to 
their faithfulness in performing the 
duties that the gospel enjoins upon 
them. The teacher has the right to 
inquire into everything pertaining 
to the welfare and standing of the 
people who call themselves Latter- 
day Saints. He may ask them if 
they live in peace together, if there 
is love. and affection existing be- 
tween husband and wife, if there is 
proper affection and love in the 
father and the mother for the chil- 
dren, and whether or not the chil- 
dren respect and honor their fathers 
and their mothers, as the Lord has 
commanded. He may inquire if the 
children live together in love and 
peace as brothers and sisters ought 
to live, and if the family engage 
in prayer night and morning; and 
if the parents teach their children to 
pray vocally, and believe in and re- 
member their secret prayers, as 
commanded in the revelations of the 
Lord. He may inquire of the Saints 
if they backbite or speak evil of

their neighbors, or of one another, 
or if there is quarreling or conten- 
tion, or dissension and lack of broth- 
erly love and kindness exhibited in 
the family, on the part of any mem- 
ber towards any other member, or 
on the part of members of the fam- 
ily towards their neighbors and 
friends. He may inquire if the 
Saints sustain and uphold the 
Priesthood of God, and those whom 
the Lord has called to preside as 
general authorities in the Church, 
or as the local authorities in stake or 
ward or branch ; whether or not 
they accent the restoration of the 
gospel and believe in it and believe 
in the Prophets who have been in- 
spired and raised up to perform the 
work the Lord has allotted them in 
the latter davs ; and whether or not 
they accept the organization of the 
Church. The teacher may inquire 
of the familv if they attend their 
sacrament meetings on the Sabbath 
day, and partake of the sacrament 
and if they do so worthily; and if 
they honor th* Sabbath day and 
keep it holy. These servants of the 
Lord mav also inquire if there are 
members in the family who take the 
name of the Lord in vain ; if they 
are honest and if they are truthful, 
and if they are pure. All these 
thinp-^ th° teacher has the right to 
inquire a K out. and it is his duty to 
inquire a^out them. js/ 
As ■> nqrt of trie preparation of a 
teacher it would be well, it seems 
to m* 3 . to find out the condition and 
the standing of the members of the 
Church in t^e district, as shown by 
the ward records, and besides this, 
as I hnv° cViowri. he has the right to 
inquire n-f the fatnilv and the mem- 
bers thereof in all things pertaining 
to th oi ' r c+qnrline and fellowship and 
conduct- as members of the Church. 
The t°acher should be prepared, 



and able to expound the word of 
the Lord, and to preach the gospel, 
and to correct whatsoever ought to 
be corrected that he discovers in 
the family, or in any member there- 
of. He should also teach the first 
principles of the gospel. He should 
inquire of the parents if they have 
taught their children the gospel of 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
repentance of sin, and baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins, 
and the laying on of hands, for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost ; and if they 
have taught them to pray, and walk 
uprightly before the Lord. And 
then, according as his findings may 
be, he can preach or give counsel 
or instruction. He should be pre- 
pared to answer questions that 
might be asked of him by members 
of the family, thereby enlightening 
their minds or removing therefrom 
doubts that may be lurking there 
concerning the doctrines of the 
Church or the principles of salva- 
tion. He should be able to make 
clear to the understanding of all the 
members of the household every- 
thing pertaining to this glorious lat- 
ter-day work. 

Now let the teachers go forth 
and do their duty, and accomplish 
the strengthening of the Church, 
and the increasing of faith among 
the people and stir up the Saints to 
greater diligence in the performing 
of the duties and obligations of their 
membership in the Church. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
would like to say a word pertaining 
to the duties of the Saints. You 
fathers and mothers, you heads of 
families, you parents of children 
who have homes in Zion, and you 
children, what is your duty with re- 
lation to the coming of the teachers 
into vour households ? It is the du- 
ty of the father or the head of the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



house to welcome most earnestly 
the servants of the Lord, to call his 
wife and his children together, and 
to bring order and peace in the 
house, and to introduce to his chil- 
dren or family the teachers as the 
servants of the Lord, who have 
come in the name of the Lord, and 
with the authority of the Priest- 
hood, to teach the family and to 
inquire into their welfare and their 
conduct. Then the family shall sub- 
mit to the instructions that the 
teacher shall be led to impart unto 
them, and there shall be no spirit of 
resentment or objection on the part 
of members of the family to the 
questions or inquiries that may be 
made of them by the servants of the 
Lord. 

I have been informed by some 
teachers that there are some mem- 
bers of the Church who object to 
the teachers inquiring into their per- 
sonal lives, and conduct, and ques- 
tioning them about their faith in the 
gospel and their obedience in keep- 
ing the commandments of God con- 
sidering them impertinent and un- 
necessary. Well now, you Latter- 
day Saints, if there are any who 
take such a position as that, you are 
in error, you are mistaken, and 
you don't understand the rights of 
the Priesthood as you should, nor 
the object of the coming of the 
teachers to your homes, as you 
should, neither have you the proper 
spirit in your own heart, if you re- 
sent the good will of the teachers 
when they ask these questions in 
order to find out your condition, 
that they may help you and bless 
you, and be a strength and a power 
to you in helping you to overcome 
the weaknesses of the flesh. You 
cannot show disrespect to the Priest- 
hood without bringing upon your- 
selves the displeasure of the Lord. 



Most of us men in the Church hold 
the Priesthood ourselves, and if a 
teacher comes into my house and he 
holds a lesser office in the Priest- 
hood than I, and for that reason or 
any other I resent his making in- 
quiry into my personal life and con- 
duct, and standing in the Church, 
I disrespect the Priesthood. If I dis- 
respect the Priesthood as it is held 
by another, I dishonor the Priest- 
hood as I may hold it myself, and I 
should not do that. We should re- 
spect the Priesthood and honor it. 
no matter who holds it, and especi- 
ally should we honor and respect a 
man who endeavors to magnify his 
calling in the midst of the Saints. 

Now, I would like to say that 
much for both teacher and those 
who shall be taught, that we shall 
teach our children and set them the 
example, when the teachers come in- 
to our houses, of respect for them as 
the servants of the Lord ; show 
them that if they respect the teacher 
who holds the Priesthood, they like- 
wise respect their father who also 
holds the Priesthood, and that in 
dishonoring any servant of God who 
holds that Priesthood, he dishonors 
his own father, and himself, and 
whosoever dishonors the Priesthood 
of God, shows dishonor to God 
Himself. Therefore, welcome the 
teachers to your homes, listen to 
them, answer their questions. We 
all may rest assured that whenever 
we object to any question that a 
teacher may ask, as he is moved 
upon and inspired by the Spirit of 
the Lord, we condemn ourselves. 
Where is the man who pays an hon- 
est tithing who will object to the 
teacher asking him if he pays his 
tithing? Why, instead he will feel 
a little sorry if the teacher does not 
ask him that question, so that he 
may answer, yes, honestly, before

the Lord I pay my tithes and my 
offerings. We will only object to 
those things wherein we fail to do 
our duty. If we object it will be 
when we are at fault. If we do not 
pay our tithing and offerings we do 
not want to be asked if we do pay 
them. If we are not pure in heart 
we would not like to be asked if 
we are. If we take the name of 
God in vain, why some of us would 
not like to have the bishop, or his 
representative, the teacher, inquire 
of us if we keep the Lord's name 
holy; and if we desecrate the Sab- 
bath day we may feel a little of- 
fended if we are asked about it, but 
we should not be. If we have the 
proper spirit, the proper under- 
standing of the rights of the Priest- 
hood, and of the organization, and 
authority of the Church, then even 
if we have offended in some things, 
we will have the spirit of humility 
and confess our sins, acknowledge 
our shortcomings, and have in our 
hearts the desire and show a will- 
ingness to be assisted by the 
teachers in overcoming these things ; 
that through the instructions and 
the counsel and the good feelings of 
these servants of the Lord, we our- 
selves may be helped in overcoming 
these weaknesses of the flesh. 

Now. I pray the Lord to bless us 
all, that we may put into effect the 
organization of the Church, to the 
end, that every home shall be visited 
by those holding the Priesthood, and 
that every man visiting shall be en- 
dowed with knowledge and inspira- 
tion and ability to teach, and that 
every family will have the spirit of 
reception, to receive and rejoice in 
whatsoever instructions may be im- 
parted, and to receive likewise with 
humility whatsoever reproof may be 
found necessary to be given by those 
who are our instructors. Thus may 



the Church be indeed blessed and 
benefitted, and the people strength- 
ened, and iniquity be done away, 
and sin be repented of, and right- 
eousness and good feeling and love 
for God and man, and a determina- 
tion to serve Him and keep His 
commandments, be manifest on the 
part of every member in the Church 
of God, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

God's commands an expression of a 
loving Father's wishes. — Each mem- 
ber of the Church may receive in- 
spiration. — Responsibility shared My 
all in God's work— Liberty and 
blessings assured only by righteous- 
ness. — Admonition to sustain the 
laws and government. 

I have listened with very great 
interest, and I am sure with much 
profit to me, to the kind words of 
counsel and admonition that have 
been delivered to us by our breth- 
ren. I have thought what a beau- 
tiful organization we are identified 
with, and how merciful the Lord 
has been to us His Childrenjn this 
day and age of the world. It is not 
hard for me to comply with the re- 
quirements that are made of me by 
my heavenly Father, and I realize 
that His teachings to me come 
through those whom He has chos- 
en. When I was a child I recog- 
nized, or thought I did, that the 
commandments of the Lord were 
His laws and regulations for my 
guidance. I thought I recognized 
in the disobedience to those laws 
that punishment would follow, and 
as a child I presume I may have 
felt that the Lord had so arranged 
affairs and so ordained matters in 
this life that 1 must obey certain 
laws or swift retribution would fol- 
low. But as I grew older I have 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



learned the lesson from another 
viewpoint, and now to me the laws 
of the Lord, so-called, the counsels 
contained in the Holy Scriptures, 
the revelations of the Lord to us 
in this day and age of the world, 
are but the sweet music of the 
voice of our Father in heaven in 
His mercy to us. They are but 
the advice and counsel of a loving 
parent, who is more concerned in' 
our welfare than earthly parents 
can be, and consequently that which 
at one time seemed to bear the 
harsh name of law to me is now the 
loving and tender advice of an all- 
wise heavenly Father. And so I 
say it is not hard for me to believe 
that it is best for me to keep the 
commandments of God. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
in the privileges that we enjoy. I 
am grateful for my standing in the 
Church. I am thankful for all that 
has been given to me, and I am 
particularly pleased today to be 
considered worthy to enjoy the 
companionship of such men as 
those who are called to preside in 
Israel, and of such men and wom- 
en as are in this congregation, and 
are scattered throughout the length 
and breadth of these great valleys 
of the mountains. I believe in 
you, my brethren and sisters. I 
have confidence in your faith and 
in your integrity, as I have confi- 
dence in those who preside over 
us. I realize that you are entitled 
to the same knowledge that he is 
who presides over the Church. You 
are entitled to the same inspiration 
that flows to those whom God has 
caused to be ordained as His lead- 
ers. You are entitled to the inspir- 
ation of the Spirit, and the knowl- 
edge that He is your Father, and 
when I say you I speak of all those 
who have obeyed the command- 



ments of our Father, and have par- 
taken of the sweet influence of the 
Spirit of the Lord in the Church 
of Christ. But, I realize that as 
each of us is entitled to the inspir- 
ation of the Lord in proportion to 
the manner in which we live a god- 
ly life, there comes to each of us a 
responsibility to do for others what 
hase been done for us. 

I realize, my brethren and my 
sisters, that I am responsible to the 
Lord for the furtherance of this 
work as the President of the Church 
is. I realize that each of you also 
are responsible to Him for the pro- 
motion of this work, as are those 
who preside over you. I cannot 
say, "Am I my brother's keeper?" 
I cannot shift the responsibility to 
those who preside over me, but 
standing in the ranks of the chil- 
dren of our Father I must bear my 
portion, I must carry that part of 
the load that the Lord places up- 
on me, and if I shirk, then T realize 
that I forfeit the blessing that 
would come to me by obedience to 
Jhe commandments of our Father. 
There is just one point that I desire 
to touch, that was upon mv mind 
before I came to the stand, and that 
is the condition that confronts us in 
this great nation. The Lord has 
given us a free country in which to 
live. It is only free to us so long 
as the laws that govern it are 
obeyed by the people who live 
here. The spirit of unrest that per- 
vades the world is in fulfillment of 
the prophecies that the Lord made, 
that in these latter days there 
should be wars and rumors of 
wars ; that there should be earth- 
quakes, and the sea should heave 
itself beyond its bounds. I see in 
the daily bulletins as we read them 
m the press.the fulfillment of oroph- 
ecy. I see the hand dealings of

God with the children of men. Oh, 
how my heart is filled with grati- 
tude that my lot has been cast in 
the land where the people of God 
dwell, the land of Zion, the land 
that is choice above all other lands, 
and that we enjoy the liberty of the 
government in which we live. I 
feel that, as long as the people of 
this land obey, or strive to keep the 
commandments of God, this liberty 
will continue to flow unto us, and 
that when selfishness, vice and 
crime arise, whether it be at the 
head or at the foot, there is a sap- 
ping of the vital life of the institu- 
tions of this land that bodes nothing 
but evil for us. I do hope and pray 
that the sons and daughters of 
God, born and reared under the 
folds of Old Glory, or who have 
made this their home, may stand 
true and faithful to the institutions 
of our country, and may ever raise 
their voices in defense of the law 
of the land, for it is the law of 
God to us in so much as it is for the 
uplifting of the children of men. 
Let us not associate ourselves with 
bands of men, or associations of in- 
dividuals, who may be finding fault 
and criticising, striving to tear 
down, villifying men who are called 
to preside over us, destroying, as 
far as their influence may be, the 
free institutions that our Father 
has blessed us with. Oh, my breth- 
ren and sisters, let me plead with 
you that each of us, wherever we 
may be, may raise our voices in the 
interest of law as it has been estab- 
lished, and will continue to be ad- 
ministered in the land in which we 
live. Let us not be among those 
who breathe the spirit of treason. 
Let us not be among those who en- 
courage the spirit of anarchy, for 
I say to you that our only hope, and 
the hope of the sons and daughters 



that God may bless us with, to en- 
joy peace and liberty in this land, 
is in standing by the Constitution 
that God has inspired to direct this 
government. Let us stand by the 
law-makers, and encourage them in 
the making of just laws, and stand 
by the executive departments, and 
the judiciary in the administration 
of those laws. God's house is a 
house of order, and we may only 
hope to enjoy His blessings by be- 
ing orderly in our lives, and by sus- 
taining those institutions that He 
has given to us, not to curtail our 
joy, not to prevent our happiness, 
but that our happiness may be com- 
plete, and that our joy may be 
full. 

May the Lord of Israel bless us, 
and may our brethren and sisters 
of other faiths, seeing us with a de- 
termination to be true children of 
the Lord, seeing in us a desire to 
be loyal to the institutions of our 
country, recognizing that beneath 
the folds of the flag that gives 
unto us the evidence of our liberty, 
we are marching onward steadily, 
with our faces to the responsibil- 
ities that confront us, not selfishly 
but with a desire to associate with 
all good men and women, and a 
desire to bless every child of our 
Father, wherever he may be. Let 
it be known throughout the land in 
which we live that in the valleys of 
these mountains there stands a body 
of men and women true to the insti- 
tutions of our country, true to the 
privileges that God has blessed us 
with. If we will do this He will 
be pleased with us, and those who 
misunderstand us will realize some 
day that we are indeed their 
friends, their brethren and their sis- 
ters. 

May the Lord continue to bless 
those who preside over us in the 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nation, and those who have been 
called in the midst of- this people to 
preside, that we may not forfeit in 
any way the blessings of our Father 
by our lack of obedience, or our 
lack of faith; and by and by, when 
each of us shall be summoned 
home, as President Lyman has 
said, we will be ready, whether it be 
one by one or in groups. When 
we get to the other side we may be 
able to strike hands or look in each 
other's faces. We may feel that we 
have fought the good fight, and that 
we have kept the faith, and that we 
may receive at the hands of our 
Father that welcome plaudit, 
"Well done, good and faithful ser- 
vant." 

May the Lord be with you all, 
and His blessings abound in your 
homes, and among all the people 
who are striving to do right in the 
world, and may peace abound in 
the land in which we live, and har- 
mony and union abide in the hearts 
of the Latter-day Saints, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PKESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Reverence due to Teachers. — Teachers 
visit all as members of the Church. 

There is just a few words that I 
desire to say in relation to the sub- 
ject on which some of the brethren 
have dwelt this morning, which I 
have no doubt they perfectly under- 
stand, but which, so far as I have 
heard, they omitted to say, and that 
is this : that the teachers who visit 
our homes do not come to visit us as 
Elders, or Seventies, or High 
Priests, or Apostles or Presidents. 
The teachers have jurisdiction over 
the membership of the Church, or 
the members of the Church, and 



when they come to visit us in our 
homes they, in their calling as 
teachers, visit us as members of the 
Church, and not as officers or mem- 
bers of the Priesthood. Consequent- 
ly it is the duty of all members of 
the Church, no matter who they 
are or what Priesthood they hold, 
nor what office they hold in the 
Church, — it is their duty to disrobe 
themselves, if you please, of all au- 
thority except the right of member- 
ship, or to be members in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, for it is the duty and 
prerogative of the teacher to inquire 
into the standing of members of the 
Church. Now, if we will only bear 
that in mind we will have no diffi- 
culty at all with reference to our 
"high and mighty" positions in the 
Church. 

When the teachers visit us we 
will remember that we are simply 
members of the Church, and it is 
the duty of the teachers to visit the 
members and to teach the members 
and to instruct the members of the 
Church, and to see that the members 
of the Church have no hard feelings, 
one against another ; that the mem- 
bers of the Church are united in 
their family capacities, and that they 
are in fellowship with the people of 
God, with their neighbors and with 
all mankind, and especially that they 
are in fellowship with God. That is 
the duty of the teacher, and when 
we keep that in mind everything re- 
specting the duties and authority of 
the teachers will be plain and clear 
to us. I want to say this too, that 
if somebody should happen ,to 
mount upon the "high horse" of his 
authority in the Church, it will be 
very becoming in the teacher to 
gently take him off his "high horse" 
and bring him down to the level of 
his membership, and let him un-

derstand that he (the teacher) is 
there to teach him as a member of 
the Church, and not as an officer 
of it. The teacher has a right to 
inquire into the performance of the 
duties of all members and learn 
whether they are doing their duty 
as members in all things, or not ^ _ 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

There is beauty all around, when there's ' 

love at home ; 
There is joy in ev'ry sound, when there's 

love at home. 
Peace an'd plenty here abide, smiling 

sweet on ev'ry side, 
Time doth softly, sweetly glide, when 

there's love at home. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Rey L. Pratt. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., in the Tabernacle. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the congregation to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

0, say, what is truth? Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of Truth will be, 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Fs counted but dross and refuse 

Prayer was offered by Elder Da- 
vid H. Cannon. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform ; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Christ the Revelator of truth.— God's 
purposes to be consummated in this 
age. — Man's spirit, and his immortal 
body, described. — Conditions of 
mankind after resurrection. — Eter- 
nal life explained. — Eternal life be- 
stowed on those who live by laws 
of Truth. 

If there is any one in this con- 
gregation who appreciates more 
highly than I do, the opportunity we 
have of assembling here to worship 
the Lord and receive instructions 
from His servants, it is because he 
has greater powers of appreciation 
and of enjoyment than I have. What 
there is of me in body and in spirit 
enjoys to the full this grand occa- 
sion, to assemble in general confer- 
ence and unite our faith and our 
attention, to receive the impressions 
of the Holy Spirit upon our souls, 
and to be instructed in our duties, to 
be brought to a common under- 
standing in regard to the principles 
of eternal life. This I suppose is 
the object we have in view — to gain 
eternal life, which means a great 
deal more than is generally under- 
stood in the world. We sometimes, 
in fact very often, qnote the words 
of our Savior in that sublime prayer 
which He offered to the Lord, to be 
found in the seventeenth chanter of 
St. John's record and testimonv, 
called the "Gospel of St. John." He 
said, "This is life eternal, to know 
Thee, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ whom Thou hast sent." For 
many centuries the world has been 
in comparative darkness in regard 
to the true God, in regard to the 
relationship between Jesus Christ 
and Him, and between us and our 
Eternal Father. Thus far. I think, 
we have learned a great many 
things concerning our divine par- 
entage, and the obligations we are 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



under to Him for life, being, light 
and intelligence, and for the means 
to obtain the great gift of eternal 
life in His presence. 

We yet know comparatively little 
concerning Him and His ways, but 
we have started on the right track, 
and we expect some time to see Him 
as He is, in all His glory and might 
and power, and to be made like 
Him, to be associated with Him, to 
be in full harmony with Him, and 
with beings of a like nature, and 
to enter into that blessing which is 
called eternal life. 

We are indebted for that .which 
we know, and may be indebted for 
that which we expect to know about 
our Eternal Father, to Jesus Christ 
His Son, "whom He has made heir 
of all things, and by whom also He 
made the worlds." He is the real 
witness for God in the earth. He 
was "God manifest in the flesh" 
when He dwelt among men. And 
it is by Him and through Him and 
of Him that all the truths which 
have been communicated to mortals, 
from the beginning of this world, 
have been made known. He is 
the chosen representative of the 
Father, and in Him dwelleth "the 
fulness of the Godhead bodily." He 
has had and now has under His di- 
rection men, mortal men, to repre- 
sent Him, as far as He can be rep- 
resented in mortality, and to carry 
on His work under His direction, 
and we are indebted, as an instru- 
ment in His hands, to the great 
Prophet of the nineteenth century, 
Joseph Smith, for bringing forth 
many grand and glorious truths 
concerning Deity and His work and 
His ways, His laws, His command- 
ments, and His precepts. Some- 
times we attribute these grand prin- 
ciples which we have received to the 
man through whom they came. We 



talk about "the religion of Joseph 
Smith." We talk about "the phil- 
osophy of Joseph Smith." But he 
never claimed that the religious 
truths which he brought forth, or 
the philosophical principles which 
were embodied therein, were his. 
He was an instrument in the hands 
of God of conveying divine truth, 
that truth which, as we have sung 
in the hymn this afternoon, is eter- 
nal and abideth forever. 

Truth does not change with the 
centuries. It will not change with 
the eternal ages. The truth of God 
abideth forever. That which is true,- 
coming from Him in one age of 
the world, is true in another. That 
which is true on one of His worlds 
that He has created, is true in all 
the worlds that He has caused to be 
organized and sent forth, each in its 
place, rolling in space, revolving" 
upon its own axis, preserved in its 
own. sphere, in its .own orbit, and' 
with the others contributing to the 
glory of God and bespeaking His 
handiwork. Truth never changes. 
Our conception of a truth may 
change as we grow in wisdom and 
understanding, and in clearness of 
spiritual vision. That which ap- 
peared to us to be true at one time 
we may find out later to be incor- 
rect, and so it is we who change, 
and not the truth that changes. 

President Smith, in that grand 
discourse he gave to us at the open- 
ing of this conference, referred to 
the Prophet Joseph, and to some of 
the glorious principles which have 
been revealed from heaven through 
him. These are but the beginning, 
the droppings of the shower of the 
great flood of truth which is to 
come. We are living in the dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times, and in 
this dispensation — the grandest and 
greatest of all, will be gathered in

one all things that are in Christ, not 
only His people gathered from the 
various nations to Zion to build it 
up, to prepare the place for His feet, 
but the hosts that have passed away, 
whom He will bring with Him. 
Not only are the people to be gath- 
ered together, but the glorious 
truths which have been made mani- 
fest in the ages that are past will 
all be brought forth in the dispensa- 
tion in which we are living, and 
things kept hid from the foundation 
of the world will be made manifest; 
for the Lord has promised it, and 
His promises never fail of fulfill- 
ment. This dispensation in which 
we live is signalized by a great 
many things that are different in 
some respects to former dispensa- 
tions, this being the great work of 
consummation of the purposes of 
the Almighty. The Father and the 
Son themselves appeared and 
opened this dispensation by speak- 
ing to the boy Joseph Smith. 

There is some little difference of 
opinion in regard to that great 
manifestation, on which I would like 
to say a word or two this after- 
noon. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
gives a brief account of that visita- 
tion, which is to be found in the 
book called the Pearl of Great Price. 
We can there learn the main par- 
ticulars in regard to that manifes- 
tation from on high, and it is well 
for us to read the Prophet's own 
words, so that we may know and 
understand how he considered it. 
Now, he called that manifestation 
given to him a "vision." Some of 
our brethren argue that it was not a 
vision, but that it was a reality. 
Well, is not a vision of that kind a 
reality? I view it in that light. I 
understand that Joseph Smith, when 
he had that manifestation which he 
repeatedly called a vision, actually 



saw the beings whom he described. 
To explain it properly we have to 
read Moses in his account of the 
vision of God that he had. That 
also is in the Pearl of Great Price, 
in the Book of Moses, chapter 1:11, 
and he explains it in this way : That 
he beheld the Lord and saw the 
glory that was round about Him, 
but he said "Not with my natural 
but with my spiritual eyes, for my 
natural eyes could not have beheld." 
Joseph, like Moses, saw in "vision," 
or with his "spiritual eyes." The 
fulness of the glory of God was not 
displayed to Moses even on that oc- 
casion, for no man, the Lord said, 
could behold the fulness of His 
glory and remain in the flesh. 

Now, here is a principle that we 
should understand. "There is a spir- 
it in man," or in the body of man. 
"Man," the Lord has revealed, "is 
spirit," and that part of man which 
is spirit was "in the beginning with 
God ;" and that Jesus, the Savior of 
the world, was "in the beginning 
with the Father, and is the first- 
born." We, then, are His brethren 
and sisters. We were in the be- 
ginning with God, and we could 
behold Him with our spiritual eyes 
before we had any bodies of flesh 
and bones. Now we are in the body, 
we find that we are of a dual com- 
position, that is to say, we are com- 
posed of those two first principles 
spoken of in the ninety-third sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants 
(verses 1-34). I use the term "first 
principles" because the Prophet Jo- 
seph used it when speaking on the 
subject. What are the "first princi- 
ples" in the constitution of man as 
a mortal being? We are told that 
there are certain elements which 
enter into our composition, and that 
these elements are eternal ; without 
beginning and without end. They

Doctrine and Covenants, that in the or the glory of the sun are those

who obey celestial law, who have 
fitted themselves for celestial glory 
so as to be quickened thereby when 
they are raised from the dead, by 
observing every precept and every 
commandment and every law of 
God. This is a natural process by 
which Our bodies are prepared to be 
quickened by the celestial glory, 
having rendered obedience unto the 
law, the spirit of which will quicken 
them. Next we are told about the 
terrestrial glory, that of those who 
shall enter into the terrestrial king- 
dom, whose glory compares with 
this just spoken of as the glory of 
the moon when compared with the 
sun. Then comes another division 
— that of the telestial glory like 
that of the stars in comparison with 
the others. Those who are fitted to 
enter into the telestial glory will be 
quickened by that glory, so the 
Lord says, when they have paid 
the just penalties for their sins and 
are raised from the dead; those who 
are only prepared to enter the te- 
lestial glory will be quickened by 
that glory. Then come those who 
are not worthy to enter either of 
these glories or kingdoms — the ce- 
lestial, the terrestial or the telestial. 
These are they who are called the 
"sons of perdition." 
S Satan is named Perdition, and 
the heavens wept over him when 
he fell from his high estate ; and 
those who have followed him so 
that they become imbued with his 
spirit, which is the spirit of destruc- 
tion, in opposition to the spirit 
which brings life, are his. The spir- 
it of murder enters their hearts ; 
they are ready to put to death even 
the Son of God, if His existence in 
life comes in their way. They re- 
ceived light and truth and then al- 
together turned therefrom. They 
gain power to attain to the highest 



altitude of light and truth and glory, 
then they turn around and through 
falsehood and wickedness and cor- 
ruption in their nature and in their 
works, they become servants unto 
Satan, sons of perdition. And the 
revelation says, that "all the rest, 
through the triumph and the glory 
of the Lamb, shall be brought forth 
by the resurrection of the dead" 
(verse 39). Now, then, because of 
that expression some of our breth- 
ren , entertain the notion that the 
sons of perdition will not be res- 
rected. But the Lord has told us, as 
you will read in section twenty-nine 
of the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that "then shall all the dead 
awake, for their graves shall be 
opened and they shall come forth, 
yea, even all." Very emphatic are 
the words in that section, verse 
twenty-six. The same doctrine is 
to be found in the Book of Mor- 
mon. But there is a passage in 
section eighty-eight, of the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants which will 
make the matter very clear to those 
who desire to understand it. I am 
not going to read this section ; it is 
a long one and a most manificent 
declaration of the purposes of God 
in regard to us in life, and the glory 
that is to come to us hereafter. In 
that section we have another declar- 
ation in regard to the resurrection, 
and the order of it, corresponding 
to that which we find in section 
seventy-six, but a little more ex- 
plicit in some things, though not 
quite so much so in others. I will 
tell you what it says, and you can 
hunt it up when you go home. It 
is good for you to hunt up the Doc- 
trine and Covenants and read the 
modern revelations of God. In that 
section the Lord gives an account 
of the coming forth of the differ- 
ent degrees among his children (as

the several angels shall sound their 
trumps) and enter the celestial or 
the terrestial or the telestial glory. 
And then, he says, "another angel 
shall sound his trump, which is the 
forth trump, saying, "There are 
found among those' who are to re- 
main until that great and last day, 
even the end, who shall remain 
filthy still" (verse 102). They also 
shall be raised from the dead, for it 
is written, "and they who remain 
shall also be quickened, but they 
shall return again to their own 
place" (verse 32). They are not 
worthy to enter into the telestial 
nor into the terrestial nor into the 
celestial kingdom, and therefore, not 
being willing to obey law ; but, as 
it is explained in verse thirty-five, 
"altogether abiding in sin, they can- 
not be sanctified by law nor mercy 
nor justice nor judgment, therefore 
they must needs remain filthy still." 
Because they became a law unto 
themselves, and would not abide the 
laws of God, neither in relation to 
the highest nor the other degrees 
that have been mentioned, and so 
they go away with the devil and 
his angels in eternity, and the height 
and extent and depth and the end 
of their torment no man knows ex- 
cept those who partake of that great 
condemnation. 

So that, according to the revela- 
tions of God, all shall come forth 
by the power of Jesus Christ, and 
all who are worthv to enter into the 
celestial world will receive the ce- 
lestial glorv; those wno were not 
valiant in the testimony of Jesus re- 
ceive the terrestial glory; honorable 
men of the earth, who were blinded 
by the craftiness of men, who did 
not receive the gospel in the flesh, 
but afterwards received it, inherit 
the terrestial glory. Several classes 
are spoken of who inherit that 



glory. And then a great multitude 
that no man can number, the vast 
majority of the inhabitants of the 
earth, who would not receive the 
testimony of Jesus, would not re- 
ceive the truth of God when it was 
declared unto them, they go away 
into punishment and suffer the 
wrath of God according to the 
claims of eternal justice. Justice 
will be dealt out to them, and they 
will suffer according to their de- 
serts, and pay the uttermost farth- 
ing for their debts, and then sweet 
mercy will be extended, and they 
will be brought forth and inherit the 
telestial glory. But the others, who 
are not fit "to be redeemed, either in 
the telestial or terrestial or celestial, 
are also to be raised from the dead, 
and because they would not abide 
in the truth made manifest unto 
them, but turned away from it wil- 
fully, going by degrees from wick- 
edness to wickedness, from sin to 
sin, from darkness to. darkness, they 
will go away into "outer darkness 
where there is weeping and wailing 
and gnashing of teeth." This is 
known as "the second death." They 
are banished from the presence and 
ministrations of God; they cannot 
inherit His glory; they cannot ob- 
tain the gift of eternal life, but they 
go away with the devil and his an- 
gels and suffer the wrath of God till 
justice shall be satisfied. When that 
will be we do not know, and we 
have no account concerning their 
redemption. They must, however, 
to suffer this capital punishment, 
first receive the truth and under- 
stand it. They must walk in ■ the 
light to a high and clear extent, and 
then repudiate it and become a law 
unto themselves, so that thev can no 
more be sanctified, but "must needs 
remain filthy still," But, all the 
rest, by the resurrection through

jesus Christ and His power, will be 
brought forth in their time and in 
their place, and be redeemed into 
some degree of glory, and they will 
occupy that position for which they 
have fitted themselves by their own 
doings. 

Now, about this grand gift of 
eternal life which is to be enjoyed 
by the faithful : is that inherent in 
everybody? Jesus Christ says that 
the Father gave Him certain souls 
whom He called His sheep. He 
prayed to the Father about them in 
the prayer that I have already al- 
luded to. He says: 'Thine they 
were and thou hast given them unto 
me, and I give unto them eternal 
life." In the tenth chapter of John 
and the twenty-eighth verse you 
will find the same sentiment re- 
peated. "My sheep hear my voice 
and they follow me, and I know 
them and call them by name, and 
/ give unto them eternal life, and 
no man shall pluck them out of my 
hands." Now, what does He re- 
fer to? Why, He is not speaking 
in regard to endless existence. End- 
less ■ existence is the property of 
spirit. It is also the property of 
matter. One is as eternal as the 
other in its original essence or prin- 
ciple. Matter or element is eter- 
nal, spirit is eternal. But the sons 
and daughters of God who walk in 
His ways, who receive His truth 
which abides forever, who walk in 
its light, who conquer the lusts of 
the flesh and the pride of the world, 
the sins of the world and the 
powers of darkness, who over- 
come all things, who live by 
every word that proceeds from the 
mouth of God, who come into har- 
mony with the great Eternal Father 
and Jesus Christ the Redeemer and 
beingsof a like order, who become 
one with them and overcome all 



things— they shall inherit all things, 
and they shall be like the Father and 
like the Son in glory, in happiness, 
m power, in dominion, "heirs of God 
and joint heirs with Jesus Christ." 
They shall inherit eternal life, not 7 
merely endless existence. 

Existence is one thing; life is a 
great deal more. There are things 
that exist, but they manifest no life. 
There are persons that exist and 
manifest but little life. There are 
others that have life so far as it can 
be enjoyed in mortality to the full. 
They are alive in body, they are 
alive in mind, they are alive in spir- 
it. They are spiritually, intellectu- 
ally, physically alive, and the power 
of increase is with them, and in the 
eternal world God will give this 
great gift eternally unto those who 
are worthy of it. These shall come- 
forth in the first resurrection and in- 
herit glory, immortality, eternal life 
and endless increase. One of the 
grand things referred to bv Presi- 
dent Smith as in the revelations of 
God to the Prophet Joseph, was the 
eternity of the marriage covenant, 
by which the man and the woman 
may be joined together according 
to God's order, and though death 
may part them, yet in the resurrec- 
tion they shall come forth to be hus- 
band and wife, to be parents of chil- 
dren, to have the gift of endless, 
perpetual increase, the beginning of 
their kingdom and their glory in 
worlds without end. That is real 
life, the power to continue and the 
nower to produce and to increase, 
the power of vitality in the spirit 
and in the bodv. That is full res- 
urrection, and the body and the soir- • 
it being joined together.— vou may 

call it a comoound if vou will, 

the body and the soirit being joined 
together inseparably, receiver/ a ful- 
ness of joy, a fulness of glory, just

like the Father, and just like the 
Son. Christ has passed through 
these conditions and is now an ex- 
alted being- on high, exactly like the 
Father, who is a being with a body 
of flesh and bones quickened by the 
eternal spirit that quickeneth all 
things, and in Him dwelleth the 
fulness of truth and life and glory 
and power and increase forever and 
ever. And those who follow in the 
footsteps of Jesus Christ, who is 
now to all purposes like the Father, 
will inherit similar glory, and it 
will never fade away, and it will 
be exemplified in them to the full. 
The spirit of life will be within them 
in body and in spirit, and they will 
increase forever and ever, and like 
the blessing that comes to our elder 
.brother, Jesus Christ, of the increase 
of their kingdom there shall be no 
end. 

Now, niy .brethren and sisters, in 
order to attain unto this great glory 
— the gift of eternal life which 
comes to us from the Father, 
through Jesus Christ His Son, we 
must live for it. He will give unto 
us eternal life and we shall enjoy 
it to the full, if we are sanctified 
by the truth. That is a principle 
vou will find in the prayer that I 
have alluded to, recorded in the 
seventeenth chapter of John. We 
have to be sanctified by the truth. 
We have to learn the truth and then 
live it. God will impart it unto us, 
here a little and there a little, line 
upon line, nrecept upon precept, and 
through His anointed servants 
whom He has called and appointed, 
He will convey to us those truths 
which we must receive in order to 
attain unto this great glory. Let 
us "live by every word that comes 
from the month of God." Let us 
be ready and be instant, in season 
and out of season, to perform our 



duties. Every man holding the 
Priesthood, every woman who is a 
member of the Church, strive to 
learn the truth as it is in Christ 
Jesus who speaks for the Father, 
learn the truth for ourselves, and be 
so imbued by the spirit of truth that 
we can discern truth from error and 
light from darkness, and then, hav- 
ing strength and power and ability 
in ourselves, to live by it, overcome 
all things, and be prepared to inher- 
it all things. God help us to do so, 
for Christ's sake. Amen,

I have seen, heard and felt much 
during this conference for which I 
am thankful to the Lord. The 
large attendance at the meetings, 
the" singing, the inspiring remarks 
and the influence of the Holy Spir- 
it, all contribute to make this con- 
ference most interesting. 

Those of us who have had years 
of experience in the Church, who 
have tried to conform our lives to 
the spirit and teachings of the gos- 
pel love to hear it expounded and 
when we do hear it touched upon 
by song or Sermon it vibrates 
through our souls. From sneaker 
to hearer the Spirit flows as oil from 
vessel to vessel, and we are able to 
testifv to its truth. 

My heart has been made to re- 
joice in the testimony of my breth- 
ren, and in the instructions they 
have given during this conference.

As I listened to the opening dis- 
course yesterday morning- by our 
beloved President, my mind seemed 
enlightened and my capacity en- 
larged to comprehend the beauties 
of the gospel, as I seldom have been 
privileged to do ; and my love of the 
truth and my appreciation of what 
the Lord has done for me and for 
you in providing a means of salva- 
tion and exaltation in His presence 
were greatly stimulated. 

I thank the Lord that I have been 
able to see the truth, to love it and to 
obey it ; notwithstanding the gospel 
requires that we deny ourselves 
many things which our carnal ap- 
petites and desires crave, and the 
gratification of which would give us 
a degree of pleasure. Notwith- 
standing it requires us to sacrifice, 
in some instances, association with 
parents, wives, husbands, children, 
friends, occupation and place among 
the people, and to . sacrifice our time 
and means. I thank God for the 
gospel. I desire to say unto this 
vast congregation that T find my 
greatest joy and satisfaction in de- 
nying myself, and sacrificing in this 
way for the gospel, to the extent 
that I have been called upon to thus 
sacrifice. It is my testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters, and the 
stranger that is with us, that as we 
engage to serve the Lord, to keep 
His commandments, and in proper 
spirit deny ourselves and sacrifice 
for the cause of truth, .we are bet- 
ter, happier and more hopeful. God 
sustains us by His power and by a 
testimony and assurance on > every 
occasion that the thing which we 
have done is pleasing and accept- 
able unto Him. Tt is food to our 
souls, it sustains and builds us up, it 
gives us joy, and hope of the bless- 
ing of eternal life: * 

I know the gospel is true, and I 



know the words to which we have 
listened during this conference are 
true, and I commend them to all 
who have had the privilege of hear- 
ing. The singing of the songs of 
Zion causes our souls to vibrate with 
a hearty response, and with our 
hearts full of joy and praise we sing- 
to the Lord in our conferences, and 
in other meetings and worshiping 
assemblies. The Lord has said that 
when we sing His praises, when 
the sacred hymns are the sentiments 
of our hearts, they will be received 
by Him as a prayer, and will be an- 
swered in blessings upon our heads. 
I have been delighted with the sing- 
ing during this conference, that of 
the choir and congregation, and also 
the vocal solos which we have heard. 

Just a word of criticism in rela- 
tion to singing, although I do not 
pose as a musician or a singer. In 
my traveling among the Saints, I 
have observed in some quarters that 
there is a disposition to displace the 
Latter-day Saint hymns with sec- 
tarian songs, which have been com- 
posed by those who know not the 
gospel, and not, in every instance, 
are the sentiments expressed in 
those songs in harmony with the 
truth. It is a matter of embarrass- 
ment to call our peoples' attention 
on such occasions to the necessity 
for culling out those hymns which 
do not express the truth, in which 
we can pour out our souls and sing 
with meaning and heart to the Lord, 
such as will .meet with His approval 
and call down a blessing upon us. 
I suppose that some of our breth- 
ren, choir leaders, would say that 
these hymns are old, that we want 
something new, something full of 
life and vim. I want to call atten- 
tion to the fact that that which is . 
dearer to us than all else, the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, is not 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



new. There is nothing with which 
we have to do that is older than the 
.gospel ; there is nothing dearer. Do 
we love our fathers and our moth- 
ers less because of their age, be- 
cause they are getting old? No; 
and I tell you that these hymns, 
which have been selected by inspir- 
ation from the Lord, they are never 
tiring- to the Latter-day Saints. 
They contain valuable sermons, and 
the people like to hear them, and 
we ought not to tire in singing 
them. Even in vocal solos there 
are some in our hymn books, such 
as "O, my Father," "The Seer," 
""Come, come ye Saints," and others 
that cannot be outdone or improved 
upon. I think it would be nice for 
our singers to try and arrange 
beautiful music to these beautiful 
words of praise and prayer to God. 
I know it would be edifying and ap- 
preciated by the Latter-day Saints, 
especially since we are adopting as 
a practice in the Church, more uni- 
versally, congregational singing. 

I desire to call attention of the 
bishops of the wards, and the choir 
leaders, to the fact that there is 
much talent among the Latter-day 
Saints which is dormant, which 
ought to be developing, and which 
should be encouraged among the 
young people. That is the time, 
while people are young, to develop 
the talent, and to utilize the abilities 
of those who are specially gifted. 
They should be encouraged to use, 
to a greater degree, the talent which 
God has given to them. I recognize 
that all talents are God-given. This 
would enable the Saints more uni- 
versally to join in congregational 
singing. Unto the people I would 
say, when you are solicited to join 
with the choirs of the Church to 
sirtg these hymns, you ought to feel 
that it is a mission, and feel that 



you are honored, to be called to sing 
in the congregations of the Saints 
the hymns inspired of the Lord. 
This is a very important feature of 
the worship of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
with you in the blessings of the 
Lord to us as a people ; the blessings 
which I enjoy you enjoy ; the knowl- 
edge and testimony which I have of 
the truth, I know that hundreds and 
thousands of you enjoy, in com- 
mon with me. It is well for us to be 
reminded of these things as we al- 
ways are when we meet in the wor- 
ship of the Lord. I advise the 
Saints to be faithful in attendance 
upon their sacramental and worship- 
ing meetings, as well as at your 
quorum and auxiliary association 
meetings, and thus give' evidence to 
the Lord of your appreciation of 
what He has done for you. 

I pray the blessing of the Lord 
upon all Israel. May His Spirit 
guide us in the ways of truth, duty 
and righteousness, that we may be 
saved in His kingdom, I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

the field, and looked at it in gen- 
eral. There it stood apart from the 
sagebrush and barren surroundings. 
But he was not satisfied with look- 
ing at it in the aggregate ; the con- 
veyance was stopped and he looked 
at individual heads of wheat, 
and exclaimed, ''Look what large 
heads." Just one ; it was the in- 
dividual stalk that gave him that 
impression. That was not enough. 
He broke the head, shuffled it in 
his hand, blew the chaff away, and 
examined each kernel. "The ker- 
nels," continued he, ''are plump and 
solid." After all, the test of that 
wheat field was the individual ker- 
.nel of wheat, and so it is in a com- 
munity, so it is in the Church. The 
test, after all, of the efficiency of 
God's people is an individual one. 
What is the individual doing ? Each 
one should ask, "Am I living so 
that I am keeping unspotted from 
the evil of the world?" God wants 
us here. His plan of redemption, so 
far as we are concerned, is here, 
and you, my fellow workers in the 
Church of Christ, are carrying the 
responsibility of testifying to the 
world that God's truth has been re- 
vealed, and that men and women 
can live in this world free and un- 
contaminated from the sins there- 
of, as did the Lord and Redeemer 
in His day. 

Now, what do we mean by the 
world? It is sometimes used as an 
indefinite term. I take it that the 
world refers to the inhabitants who 
are alienated from the Saints of 
God. They are aliens to the Church, 
and it is the spirit of this aliena- 
tion that we should keep ourselves 
free from. We are told by Paul 
not to' conform to the fashions of 
the world.. Titus was warned not 
to partake of those things, the evils 
of the world, and to "Flee also 



youthful lusts : but follow righteous- 
ness, faith, charity, peace with them 
that call on the Lord out of a pure 
heart." Purity of heart — Zion is 
the pure in heart, we have been 
told, and the strength of this Church 
lies in the purity of the thoughts 
and lives of its members, then the 
testimony of Jesus abides in the 
soul, and strength comes to each in- 
dividual to withstand the evils of 
the world. 

These evils present themselves in- 
sidiously in our daily associations. 
Thy come in the shape of tempta- 
tions, as they came to the Savior 
after His baptism. What were those 
temptations? When Satan said, 
"Command these stones to be made 
bread," he was appealing to the ap- 
petite. He knew that Jesus was 
hungry, that He was physically 
weak, and thought that by pointing 
to those little lime stones which 
resemble somewhat a Jewish loaf 
of bread, he could awaken a desire 
to eat. Failing in that, when He re- 
ceived the divine word, "Man shall 
not live by bread alone, but by every 
word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God." Satan then tried 
Him in another way. He dared him 
—an appeal to His pride, to His 
vanity, quoted scripture to support 
his temptation, for remember the 
devil can find scripture for his pur- 
pose, and "an evil soul producing- 
holy witnesses is like a villain with 
a smiling cheek, a goodly apple 
rotten at the heart. Oh, what a 
goodly outside falsehood has." But 
the Savior answered him in terms 
of scripture, "It is also written, 
thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy 
God." What was the third? An 
appeal to His love of power, do- 
main, wealth, "All these, (the king- 
doms of the world and the glory 
"thereof) , I will give you," said the 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY. 



59 



tempter, "if you will only fall down 
and worship me." "Get thee hence, 
Satan, for it is written, thou shalt 
worship the Lord thy God; and Him 
only shalt thou serve." Now, near- 
ly every temptation that comes to 
you and me comes in one of those 
forms. Classify them, and you will 
find. that under one of those three 
nearly every given temptation that 
makes you and me spotted, ever so 
little maybe, comes to us as (1) a 
temptation of the appetite; (2) a 
yielding to the pride and fashion 
and vanity of those alienated from 
the things* of God ; or (3) a gratify- 
ing of the passion, or a desire for 
the riches of the world, or power 
among men. 

Now, when do temptations come? 
Why, they come to us in our social 
gatherings, they come to us at our 
weddings, they come to us in our 
politics, they come to us in our busi- 
ness relations, on the farm, in the 
mercantile establishment, in our 
dealings in all the affairs of life, 
we find these insidious influences 
working, and it is when they mani- 
fest themselves to the consciousness 
of each individual that the defense 
of truth ought to exert itself. There 
may never come a great opportunity 
to defend this Church. 

It may not be on the mountain's height 

or over the stormy sea, 
It may not be at the battlefront that my 

Lord shall have need of me, 
But if by still stnall voice He calls to 

lands that I do not know, 
[ will answer, dear Lord, with my hand 

in Thine, 
T will go where you want me to go. 

When that little small voice calls 
to the performance of duty, insig- 
nificant though it seem, and its per- 
formance unknown to any one save 
the individual and God, he who 
responds gains corresponding 



strength. Temptation often comes 
in the same quiet way. Perhaps the 
yielding to it may not be known by 
any one save the individual and his 
God, but if he does yield to it, he 
becomes to that extent weakened, 
and spotted with the evil of the 
world. Let me cite an instance : 
A young missionary was in- 
vited to a wedding in a foreign 
country, at which two of his ac- 
quaintances were joined together in 
the bonds of matrimony, the cere- 
mony being performed by a min- 
ister of another church. This young 
man was the only member of the 
Mormon Church present amidst the 
one hundred or more guests at the 
table in the hotel. By each plate 
was the wine cup, filled to the brim, 
and also a glass of water. After 
the ceremony, as the guests were all 
in their places, the minister arose 
and said, "Now I propose that the 
company drink the health of the 
newly married couple.' They all 
arose. Now, propriety suggested 
that he take the wine cup. He was 
a missionary, he belonged to the 
Church that preaches the Word of 
Wisdom, revealed direct from God 
to the Prophet Joseph. Science since 
then has proved it to be indeed a 
word of wisdom. He was preach- 
ing that, and he was pretending 
to live it. Here was a time when 
he could indulge, no one would 
know ; indeed it seemed to be the 
act of propriety, but he resisted. 
Now was the time to defend his 
Church, and that is what he did. 
He took the glass of water, and 
some of his immediate friends by 
him, dropping their wine cups fol- 
lowed his example, and at least half 
a dozen wine glasses remained un- 
touched. Others saw it, and the cir- 
cumstance furnished an excellent 
opportunity to converse with these 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



guests upon the Word of Wisdom. 
Was he humiliated? No, he was 
strengthened. Were the guests em- 
barrassed? No. Did they feel to 
condemn him? No. Condemna- 
tion was replaced by admiration, as 
it always is in the hearts of intelli- 
gent and God-fearing men and 
women. I admire that counselor in 
the presidency of a stake who, at a 
political party last fall, when asked 
to drink the health and success of 
that party, left his champagne un- 
touched. When the chairman came 
he said, "You did not respond to the 
toast for the success of the party." 
Aren't you one with us?" He said, 
"Yes, I did." The chairman said, 
"There is your champagne un- 
touched." "But," replied the coun- 
selor, "you see the glass of water is 
empty. I do not drink champagne nor 
intoxicants, but I am with you in 
wishing the success of the party." 
The man grasped his hand and said, 
"I admire your strength in living up 
to your principles." They always do. 
Grater admiration have I for a 
young man who, in California a few 
months ago, was entertained by a 
man of the world and who refused 
a kind of entertainment which, if it 
had been accepted, would have de- 
prived mv friend of that which Lat- 
ter-day Saints hold as sacred as life 
itself — his virtue. The man of the 
world was somewhat surprised, but 
at the same time admired the de- 
fense — for so I consider it — and the 
strength in that "Mormon" defend- 
ing the truth and the principles of 
righteousness and the standard of 
living among the Latter-dav Saints. 
Did that "Mormon" Elder lose any- 
thing? No. he is respected among 
the men today, the thinking men of 
the world. They always are. Now, 
as I say. these temptations come 
to us in business transactions, or 



perhaps on the street car when we 
have an opportunity to refuse pay- 
ing the corporation five cents. 
Stooping to cheat a corporation! 
Well, let us always remember this, 
that the corporation can afford to 
lose that nickel, but we cannot af- 
ford to take it, to steal it. It is 
an insignificant thing, isn't it? It 
is really a great thing, it is one of 
these insidious things stealing into 
the character of the individual. 

Everywhere, in all places, let us 
remember that "Pure religion and 
undefiled before God and the 
Father, is this, to visit the father- 
less and widows in their affliction, 
and to keep himself unspotted from 
the sins of the world." Can we do 
it in aggregate? Is this just for 
the individual? Can we think of a 
body of men living this way', a hun- 
dred men and women, fifteen hun- 
dred men and women? If one can 
do it all can do it. I shall never 
forget, as long as I live, the impres- 
sion my mother gave me when she 
told the story of those two thousand 
sons who went to battle under the 
leadership of Helaman. Think of 
those boys. Hold them as a pat- 
tern, you priests, teachers and dea- 
cons, yes, and high priests, seventies 
and elders. If two thousand men in 
that ancient time could live such 
lives, two thousand, nay ten thou- 
sand and a hundred thousand men 
can live it today. These were their 
principles, founded upon the princi- 
ple of faith, inculcated into their 
hearts by their mothers, who taught 
them in their youth that if they 
praved to God nothing doubting, 
their prayers should be answered. 
Such is their testimony; such was 
the result of their mothers' teach- 
ings, showing the influence of home 
on the boys' lives.

They were all young men and they 
were exceeding valiant for courage, for 
strength and activity, and behold this 
was not all. They were men who were 
true at all times and in whatsoever thing 
they were entrusted. 

Now, I tell you that is good gos- 
pel, 

Yea, they were men of truth and sob- 
erness, for they had been taught to keep 
the commandments of God and to walk 
uprightly before Him. Now, it came to 
pass that _ Helaman did march at the 
head of his two thousand stripling sol- 
diers, to the support of the people in the 
borders of the land on the south by the 
sea. 

You know the story, you know 
how successful they were, and how 
God blessed them, as He will bless 
everv' man and woman, no matter 
where he may be, who will stand 
for righteousness and truth, and live 
so as to keep himself unspotted from 
the world. As I think of these two 
thousand men going out to defend 
their homes, pure in their lives, 
stead fa<=t in their testimony of God's 
truth, so I want to think of the 
Priesthood throughout all Israel, 
high priests, seventies, whose duty 
is to preach these things by their 
lives and words, of our elders, our 
young men, priests, teachers and 
deacons — a solid phalanx of men 
standing before the world as a light 
that cannot be hid, because their 
lives are clean and pure. Thev are 
unspotted from the world. Then 



we shall indeed be a "peculiar peo- 
ple" and become as God would have 
us, because we are preaching the 
gospel by our acts. "If you love 
me," says the Lord, "keep my com- 
mandments." 

May He help us to do it, keep us 
pure and free,- our homes pure and 
true, that our children may breathe 
the atmosphere of puritv and virtue, 
and we be ever true to the testimony 
of God that we have in our hearts ; 
viz., that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
is restored to the earth, that His 
prophets are upon the earth, that 
He revealed the grandest of truths 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith in this 
dispensation of the fullness of times, 
and that we holding the holy priest- 
hood must carry the responsibility 
of setting the example of truth and 
purity unto the whole world — I say 
may He help us to do this, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning ? 
The Latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis Anderson.

day, Oct. 8th, 10 a. m. 



THIRD DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Sunday, Oct. 
8th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by- 
President Joseph F. Smith, and he 
announced that an overflow meeting 
will convene this morning, in the 
Assembly Hall, for the benefit of the 
many who can not be accommodated 
in the overcrowded Tabernacle. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

An angel from on high 

The long, long silence broke ; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious wor'ds he spoke : 

Lo ! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 

A sacred record lies concealed. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Charles A. Callis. 

Lizzie T. Edward, Pearl K. Da- 
vis, Fred Graham, and Moroni J. 
Thomas rendered a quartette, en- 
titled, "As the dew from heaven dis- 
tilling." 

President Joseph F. Smith an- 
nounced that part of the morning 
service will be devoted to an address 
by Elder Orson F. Whitney, in hon- 
or of the memory of a great man of 
God, the late Apostle Orson Pratt. 
By request of President Smith, the 
family and relatives of Apostle 
Pratt arose in the congregation, and 
it was observed that they numbered 
about four hundred persons.

One hundred years ago, in a 
humble village of the Empire State, 
a man was born of whom it was 
said, as he lay in his casket at Salt 
Lake City on the 6th of October, 
1881, that he had traveled more 
miles, preached more sermons, 
studied and written more upon the 
Gospel and upon science, than any 
other man in the Church. That 
man was Orson Pratt, and the 
speaker who eulogized him was 
Wilford Woodruff, his fellow 
Apostle and Pioneer. 

There were many who knew Or- 
son Pratt better than I, but none 
admired or esteemed him more. 
And yet my knowledge of him was 
not based upon intimate associa- 
tion ; I scarcely knew him in a social 
way, and never had the opportu- 
nity to converse with him. My ac- 
quaintance with the man was wholly 
of a public character, and the in- 
formation I possess concerning his 
career is shared by tens of thou- 
sands. 

He was of English and Puritan 
descent, his father's ancestor, Lieu- 
tenant William Pratt, being among 
the first settlers of Hartford, Con- 
necticut. Lieutenant Pratt's father 
was Reverend William Pratt, of 
Stevenidge, Hertfordshire, Eng- 
land. Orson Pratt was born at 
Hartford, Washington County, 
New York, Sept. 19, 1811. His 
parents were Jared Pratt and his 
wife Charity Dickinson. Orson was

next to the youngest of six chil- 
dren. His elder brother Parley was 
destined like himself to become a 
noted preacher and writer, and one 
of the earliest settlers of the Rocky 
mountain region. Jared Pratt was 
a weaver and a tiller of the soil. 
He had no faith in creeds or 
churches, but taught his children to 
be moral, and to believe in the Bible. 

Orson received his first schooling 
at New Lebanon, Columbia County, 
in his native State. To that place 
the family moved when he was three 
or four years old. He was sent to 
school several months in each year 
until the spring of 1822, when he 
hired out as a farm boy. Whether 
in school or out, his studious mind 
was always at work, and at inter- 
vals he picked up a knowledge of 
arithmetic, bookkeeping, geography, 
grammar and surveying. 

Though a frequent reader of the 
Scriptures, he was not deeply con- 
cerned about religion until the au- 
tumn of 1829, when he began to 
pray fervently for spiritual light and 
guidance. About a year later two 
Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints came into his 
neighborhood and held meetings. 
One of these Elders was his brother, 
Parley P. Pratt, by whom Orson 
was baptized on the nineteenth an- 
niversary of his birth. October of 
that year found him at Fayette, 
Seneca County, the birthplace of the 
Church, which was then only six 
months old. While there he met 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and was 
confirmed by him a member and 
ordained an Elder on the first day 
of November, 1830. His first mis- 
sion, taken soon after, was to Coles- 
ville, in Broome County. 

Early in 1831 he followed the for- 
tunes of the Saints to Ohio, and at 
Kirtland, where he presided . over 
the Elders, was ordained a High 



Priest by Sidney Rigdon. From 
that time forth he was busy travel- 
ing, preaching, and building up 
branches pf the Church. Among 
his converts in the Eastern States 
were his brother Anson, at Hurl- 
gate, Long Island; Amasa M. Ly- 
man, at Bath, New Hampshire ; and 
the Farr, Snow, and Gates families 
in Vermont. At Kirtland he taught 
an evening grammar school, and 
was himself a student under Pro- 
fessor Seixas, a New York savant, 
who certified to his proficiency in 
Hebrew, after a course of instruc- 
tion extending through eight weeks. 

Orson Pratt helped to organize 
Zion's Camp, and during the jour- 
ney to Missouri, whither the ex- 
pedition went to reinstate the Jack- 
son County Saints upon the lands 
from which they had been driven by 
mob violence, he had charge of sev- 
eral wagons. When cholera broke 
out in camp, he was one of those at- 
tacked by it, but his great faith and 
iron will saved him, while others 
perished. In Missouri he was a 
member of the High Council. 

At Columbus, Ohio, in April, 
1835, he learned that he had been 
chosen one of the Twelve Apostles, 
and was expected to be at Kirtland 
on the twenty-sixth of that month, 
for ordination. A journey of two 
days by stage-coach enabled him 
to arrive there on the day appointed, 
and he was ordained an Apostle un- 
der the hands of David Whitmer 
and Oliver Cowdery, two of the 
Three Witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon. 

When the Church moved from 
Ohio, Orson Pratt was presiding 
over a large branch in New York 
City. Summoned to Far West, Mis- 
souri, which had become the head- 
quarters of the Latter-day Saints, 
he was on his way there with his 
family, and had reached St. Louis,

where he was ice-bound, the rivers 
being- frozen, when he learned of the 
expulsion of his people from that 
State. He rejoined them at Ouincy, 
Illinois, m the spring of 1839. 

During the previous summer, 
while the Saints were still in Mis- 
souri, the'Prophet, voicing the word 
of the Lord, had directed the Apos- 
tles to take a mission to Europe, and 
the appointment designated the very 
date upon which they should leave 
Far West, starting from the Temple 
lot in that city. This was before the 
mob troubles arose, and before there 
was any prospect of an armed col- 
lision between Missourians and 
Mormons. But now all was 
changed ! The Saints had been 
driven out; and it was almost as 
much as a Mormon's life was worth 
to be seen in Missouri. The day 
set for the departure of the Apos- 
tles was approaching, but they were 
far away, and the mob leaders were 
boasting that "Joe Smith's proph- 
ecy" concerning the event would 
fail. Joseph himself was a prisoner 
in the hands of the Missourians, as 
was his brother, Hyrum Smith, also 
Parley P. Pratt, and other leaders ; 
but Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- 
ball, Orson Pratt,, John Taylor, and 
others of the Twelve were at liberty, 
and they determined to fulfill the 
Proohet's prediction. Accordingly 
before daybreak on the day ap- 
pointed, April 26, 1839, they rode 
into Far West, held a meeting on 
the Temple lot, ordained Wilford 
Woodruff and George A. Smith to 
the Apostleship, and started upon 
their foreign mission ; the enemy 
meanwhile wrapt in slumber, oblivi- 
ous to what was taking place. 

Delaved by the founding of Nau- 
voo, Illinois, and by an epidemic of 
fever and aeue that swept over that 
newly settled region, the Apostles 
did not cross the Atlantic until 



about a year later. Landing at Liv- 
erpool, penniless, and among stran- 
gers, they remained in Great Brit- 
ain a little over twelve months, dur- 
ing which period they baptized 
seven or eight thousand persons, 
and raised up branches of the 
Church in almost every noted city 
and town throughout ' the United 
Kingdom. They also established a 
periodical, "The Millennial Star," 
with Parley P. Pratt as editor; 
published five thousand copies of 
the Book of Mormon, fifty thousand 
tracts, and three thousand hymn 
books; besides emigrating a thou- 
sand people to Nauvoo, and found- 
ing a permanent emigration agency. 
The British Mission had previously 
been opened by Heber C. Kimball 
and Orson Hyde, with their asso- 
ciates ; now its foundations were 
laid broad and deep. 

In the assignment of mission 
fields Scotland fell to Orson Pratt. 
It has been said that a Scotchman 
should always be in the right, for he 
is hard to turn. The Apostle proved 
the truth of this saying during his 
experience in and around Edin- 
burgh, where he fasted, prayed, and 
preached for nine months, succeed- 
ing, after much difficulty, in raising 
up a branch of more than two hun- 
dred members. His patient zeal 
never flagged. His daily climbs up 
the slopes of Arthur's Seat, a moun- 
tain overlooking the town and from 
the summit of which he besought 
the God of Israel to give him the 
hearts of that people, is one of the 
picturesque episodes of "Mormon" 
missionary life. While upon this 
mission he published his pamphlet, 
"Remarkable Visions," the perusal 
of which drew many into the 
Church. He returned to America 
early in 1841. 

During the next few years he

resided at Nauvoo, where he had 
charge of a mathematical school, 
and was a member of the City 
Council. He also filled missions in 
the East, and at the City of Wash- 
ington presented a memorial, pre- 
pared by himself and others, signed 
by the members of the Nauvoo City 
Council, praying for redress of the 
wrongs suffered by the Saints while 
in Missouri. During his leisure 
moments he calculated eciipses and 
prepared an almanac for publication 
in 1845. It was entitled "The Proph- 
etic Almanac," and was calculated 
from the latitude and meridian of 
Nauvoo and other American towns. 
"From 1836 to 1844," says the 
Apostle, "I occupied much of my 
leisure time in study, and made my- 
self thoroughly acquainted with al- 
gebra, geometry, trigonometry, conic 
sections, differential and integral 
calculus, astronomy, and most of 
the physical sciences. These studies 
I pursued without the assistance of 
a teacher." He was in the East 
when the Prophet and the Patriarch 
were slain, and returned to Nauvoo 
soon after the martyrdom. 

The exodus of the Latter-day 
Saints from Illinois began in Feb- 
ruary, 1846. The Mississippi River 
was frozen over, and some of the 
companies crossed on the ice. Or- 
son Pratt, who had recently re- 
turned from another eastern mis- 
sion, was one of the leaders of this 
migratory m movement, which was 
destined to redeem an arid waste, 
and found an empire in the heart of 
the Great American Desert. Dur- 
ing their slow progress over the 
snow-covered or rain-soaked 
prairies to the bluffs of the Missouri 
River, the pilgrims halted many 
times, and were even under the ne- 
cessity of forming temporary settle- 
ments. Garden Grove and Mount 



Pisgah, at which places the leaders, 
in council, decided to send a com- 
pany of pioneers to the Rocky 
Mountains, in advance of the main 
body of the people. Preparations 
for this expedition were under way 
when, at the Bluffs, in July, i846, 
the enlistment of the Mormon Bat- 
talion, five hundred volunteers, as 
part of the United States military 
force then invading Mexico and her 
provinces, postponed the departure 
of the Pioneers until the next sea- 
son. 

Orson Pratt was one of the one 
hundred and forty-three men led by 
President Brigham Young from the 
Missouri River westward during the 
spring and summer of 1847. They 
started from the "Mormon" town of 
Winter Quarters (now Florence, 
Nebraska), about the middle of 
April, arriving in Salt Lake Valley 
on Saturday, the 24th of July. 
Brother Pratt entered the valley 
three days in advance of the general 
arrival. 

It happened thus. President 
Young, after leaving Fort Bridger, 
had been attacked by mountain 
fever, and under his direction Orson 
Pratt, with a number of men and 
wagons, led the way down Echo 
Canyon, up East Canyon, through 
and over the Wasatch Mountains 
toward the shores of the Great Salt 
Lake. From the summit of Big 
Mountain, on the nineteenth of July, 
Orson Pratt and John Brown, rid- 
ing ahead of their companions, 
caught the first glimpse of the val- 
ley; and on the 21st, Orson Pratt 
and Erastus Snow, the latter a mes- 
senger from President Young, 
emerged from Emigration Canyon, 
a little south of where Fort Douglas 
now stands. They had a single sad- 
'dle horse, and were riding by turns. 
The day being warm. Brother Snow

took off his coat and hung it loosely- 
over the saddle bow. Missing it, he 
rode back toward the mountains to 
look for it, leaving his companion to 
walk on alone to the banks of City 
Creek. This stream then divided 
into two branches, one flowing 
south, the other west. Thus it was 
that Orson Pratt was the first of the 
Pioneers to tread the site of Salt 
Lake City. 

Any other member of that historic 
band might have done as much had 
chance or destiny so decided ; but 
how many of them could have laid 
out the town that was founded here 
that memorable summer? This 
honor also fell to Orson Pratt, who, 
assisted by Henry G. Sherwood, 
ran the original survey of Salt Lake 
City, on Monday, the 2nd of Au- 
gust. He ascertained the altitude 
of the Valley, and determined its 
latitude and longitude. We are also 
indebted to Orson Pratt and a few 
men like him for what we know of 
the experiences of the Pioneers 
during and after their journey to 
the West. 

From the summer of 1848 to the 
spring of 1851, this Apostle pre- 
sided 'over the European Mission, 
with headquarters at Liverpool. 
The British Isles contained at that 
time, according to his published 
statement, about 40,000 Latter-day 
Saints. President Pratt's reputa- 
tion as speaker and writer had pre- 
ceded him, and the sun of his fame 
now rose nigh to the zenith. As 
president, preacher, editor, and au- 
thor, he labored almost incessantly. 
Every noted town in the three king- 
doms heard the sound of his voice, 
deep, sonorous, powerful, proclaim- 
ing with fervid and fearless elo- 
quence the principles he had been 
sent to promulge — the principles of 
the Everlasting Gospel. While edit- 



ing the Millennial Star, he wrote, 
published and distributed many 
pamphlets on doctrinal, historical, 
and philosophical themes, and with 
means obtained from the sale of his 
works, supplied the urgent needs of 
a portion of his family who were 
still on the Iowa frontier. He was 
visiting them in the spring of 1850, 
when he received word from Presi- 
dent Young that he was honorably 
released from his mission and at 
liberty to return to Utah. 

In the Legislative Assembly of 
the Territory, almost from the be- 
ginning, Orson Pratt was a member 
of the Council, and he sat in every 
subsequent Legislature when at 
home. During several sessions he 
was Speaker of the House of Rep- 
resentatives. 

As one of the corps of instructors 
of the University of Deseret, now 
University of Utah, he delivered, in 
the winter and spring of 1851-1852. 
a series of twelve public lectures on 
astronomy, which awakened gener- 
al interest. He had now achieved 
fame in the field of higher mathe- 
matics, having discovered, in No- 
vember. 1850, a law governing 
planetary rotation, and subsequent- 
ly making other scientific discov- 
eries. Professor Proctor, the as- 
tronomer, while lecturing at Salt 
Lake City early in the eighties, re- 
ferred almost reverently to Profes- 
sor Pratt, expressing the opinion 
that there were but four real mathe- 
maticians in the world, and that Or- 
son Pratt was one of them. He was 
such an ardent lover of knowledge, 
and so anxious to disseminate it. 
that he offered to teach the youth of 
the community free, if they would 
give their time to study. 

In August, 1852, he took up a 
temporary residence in Washington, 
D. C. where he published "The 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

Seer," a periodical devoted to the 
dissemination of "Mormon" doc- 
trines. In its columns appeared the 
revelation on Plural Marriage and 
Joseph Smith's prophecy on War. 
At the same time he presided 
over the Latter-day Saints in all 
the States of the Union and in 
the adjoining British provinces. 
Then followed another presiding 
mission in Great Britain, from 
which he returned by way of Cali- 
fornia, while Johnston's army, sent 
to Utah to put down an imaginary 
rebellion, was in winter quarters 
east of the Wasatch Mountains. 

The spring of 1864 found the 
Apostle at Vienna, endeavoring to 
obtain a foothold for missionary 
work in the Austrian capital. But 
the laws of that country were too 
stringent for such an undertaking, 
and he, with his companion, Elder 
William W. Riter, returned to Eng- 
land. There President Pratt pub- 
lished, in May, 1866, an edition of 
his mathematical work, "Pratt's Cu- 
bic and Bi-Quadratic Equations." 
Three years later, in New York 
City, he transcribed and published 
the Book of Mormon in the phon- 
etic characters of "The Deseret 
Alphabet." 

August, 1870, was made memor- 
able by a g^reat public discussion in 
the Salt Lake Tabernacle, where 
Orson Pratt, the "Mormon" apostle, 
debated with Dr. John P. Newman, 
Methodist pastor and Chaplain of 
the United States Senate, the ques- 
tion, "Does the Bible sanction 
Polygamy?" The debate lasted 
three days, and was listened to by 
ten thousand people. The umpires, 
chosen by both parties, rendered no 
decision — that being one of the pre- 
liminary conditions — but it was the 
general verdict of "Mormons" and 
Gentiles that while Newman, was the 



more eloquent, ornately so, at least, 
Pratt was the better informed, and 
the more logical. Both men were 
thorough scriptorians, but the Apos- 
tle surprised even his learned oppo- 
nent by his profound knowledge of 
the original Hebrew, and his clear- 
cut mathematical demonstrations. 
The Boston "Banner of Light," 
commenting on the result, said: 
"Some one carrying more guns than 
Dr. Newman will have to be sent 
out missionarying among the 'Mor- 
mons.' " 

In 1874 Orson Pratt became the 
Church Historian, an office held by 
him during the remainder of his 
days. In 1877 he went to England 
to transcribe and publish an edition 
of the Book of Mormon in the Pit- 
man phonetic characters, but was 
recalled almost immediately by the 
death of President Brigham Young. 
The ensuing autumn found him re- 
visiting scenes of early "Mormon" 
history, in company with his fellow 
Apostle, Joseph F. Smith. 

December of that year brought 
another mission, the last one under- 
taken by this valiant veteran in the 
cause of Christ. It was his fifteenth 
voyage over the ocean ; this time to 
stereotype and publish at Liverpool 
the Book of Mormon and the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, as arranged by 
him in paragraphs, with footnotes 
and references. He also published 
while there his astronomical work, 
"Key to the Universe." In Lon- 
don he made a discovery regarding 
the Great Pyramid of Egypt, a dis- 
covery conclusively demonstrating 
to his mind that the date of the or- 
ganization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is sym- 
bolized in the chronological floor 
line of the Grand Gallery, in that 
ancient monument. 

The Apostle was now advanced in

years, almost upon the summit of 
his three score and ten. His ap- 
pearance was truly patriarchal, hair 
and beard being white as snow. 
Powerful in build, though of but 
medium stature, he was still men- 
tally and physically strong. During 
the whole period of his final mis- 
sion, ending in September, 1879, he 
worked, for weeks at a stretch, not 
less than eighteen hours out of the 
twenty-four. The enfeebled state of 
his health after his return showed 
that the heavy labor had told se- 
verely upon him. 

Two years later, on the third day 
of October, he died at his home in 
Salt Lake City. Just before breath- 
ing his last, he dictated to President 
Joseph F. Smith, who took down 
the words as the dying man uttered 
them, this epitaph, to be placed up- 
on his tombstone : "My body 
sleeps for a moment, but my testi- 
mony lives and shall endure for- 
ever." 

"The St. Paul of Mormondom" 
— as Tullidge styles him, was a 
preacher eloquent and powerful, a 
theologian learned and profound, a 
linguist to whom dead languages 
were an open book, a writer lucid 
and logical, a ' scientist of eminent 
attainments. Essentially a sage, 
having the philosophical tempera- 
ment as well as the philosophical 
cast of mind, he might easily have 
been classed with the Wise Men of 
Greec"e, or even with the Hebrew 
Prophets. 

The philosophical side of his na- 
ture may be illustrated by an anec- 
dote. One of the evidences of the 
humble circumstances in which he 
lived was a weather-beaten though 
respectable straw hat which he wore 
both summer and winter. One day 
his daughter, Mrs. Joseph Kimball, 
asked him : "Father, why do you 



wear a straw hat in winter ?" "To 
keep my head warm," he answered. 
"But," she persisted, "is a straw 
hat warm in winter?" "Warmer 
than no hat at all, my daughter," 
was the reply — worthy of a Dio- 
genes. 

Another incident tells something 
of his power of concentration, and 
his ability to control his feelings — 
all the more remarkable, when it is 
known that Orson Pratt was as 
high-spirited as he was fearless and 
determined. He was preaching at 
Liverpool, in the open air, when a 
noisy fellow, pushing his way 
through the crowd and planting 
himself squarely in front, began to 
denounce him. The speaker, with- 
out deigning to notice the inter- 
ruption, raised his stentorian voice, 
and going right on with his dis- 
course, poured forth a volume of 
sound that completely drowned the 
voice of his would-be disturber. The 
fellow then shouted his objections, 
but the Apostle, still further in- 
creasing his own lung power, again 
rendered the tones of the hoodlum 
inaudible.' This 'was kept up until 
the latter ceased from sheer exhaus- 
tion, and retired amid the laughter 
of the bystanders. The orator then 
lowered his voice to normal pitch, 
and continued his subject to the end. 

Orson Pratt stood at the head of 
a patriarchal household, the hus- 
band of several wives, the father of 
forty r five children, thirty-two of 
whom, evenly divided as to sons and 
daughters, survived him. Many of 
these are present today. His direct 
descendants — children, grandchil- 
dren and great-grandchildren — now 
number nearly four-hundred. 

It was a foregone conclusion that 
with a family so large, and a life so 
devoted to the public interest, he 



ELDER ORSO 

could hardly have died wealthy, 
even had he so desired. But it is 
exceedingly doubtful that he ever 
cherished such a desire. Had he 
been asked the question, once put to 
Agassiz, "Why do you not use your 
ability to acquire a fortune?" he 
would probably have answered, -as 
did the greatest naturalist, ' "I 
haven't the time." 

He may have lacked the gift. Be 
it so. Perhaps he had other gifts, 
just as great, and even greater.' 
The mind must be fed, as well as 
the body. "Man shall not live by 
bread alone." and he who ministers 
to the intellect and the spirit is, 
and ought to be, as consequential in 
any community as Hie capitalist, the 
business man, the politician, the ex- 
ecutive, whose skill is in governing 
men, or in acquiring and managing 
property, and ministering to the 
physical needs of his fellows. It 
may yet transpire that the true mis- 
sion of the man of affairs, in one of 
its functions at least, is to free such 
men as Orson Pratt from the excess 
of business cares and burdens, and 
give them time to devote to other 
pursuits, just as important and quite 
as useful, in the long run, as those 
which the many most appreciate. 
Doubtless there were times when 
this man found it difficult to pro- 
vide for his family the bread that 
perishes. One reason was that like 
his great Master, our Elder 
Brother, he had to "be about his 
Father's business," feeding a starv- 
ing world with the bread of eternal 
life. 

Why should any man assume, be 
he writer, preacher, or financier, 
that his ability was given for his 
own exclusive benefit, and his neigh- 
bor's ability for the benefit of the 
nublic ? No gift from God was ever' 
intended for self aggrandizement. 



F. WHITNEY 69 

All such endowments are altruistic 
in purpose, and were designed for 
mutual help and the general good. 
Nor should aptitude in any direc- 
tion be rated at its mere market 
value. Men pay most, as a rule, for 
things of least consequence. The 
gifts of the Gospel, which are not 
to be purchased, which are beyond 
all price, would be discounted in any 
market in the world. They who 
despise any of God's gifts are fit 
subjects for the divine clemency. 
They should be forgiven, "for they 
know not what they do." All kinds 
of good men are needed in the work 
of the Lord, and some day, under 
a better social system than now 
prevails, they will be found laboring, 
every man for the interest of his 
neighbor, "and doing all things with 
an eye single to the glory of God." 

"Without purse or scrip" — that 
was the insignia of the Apostolic 
mission ; and He who gave that mis- 
sion "had not whereto lay his head." 
Not that He was powerless to pro- 
vide for Himself and His friends, 
for He possessed all things ; but He 
made His servants poor, that the 
world might be proved, and the 
Lord's true disciples known. He 
who gives even a cup of cold water 
to a servant of God athirst, shall 
in nowise lose his reward. 

The American nation — the whole 
civilized world, or a great part of 
it, has gone money-mad, grasping 
after gold, and caring little or noth- 
ing as to how they acquire it ; mar- 
rying for money, stealing for mon- 
ey, killing for money— anything to 
get money. "Put money in thy 
purse," seems to be the 'slogan of 
the present hour; which might be 
well enough, as to money honestly 
obtained, if more people were found 
willing to open their purses, take the 
money out again, and use it as the

divine Giver intended it to be used. 
"How much is he worth in dollars 
and cents?" or "What is his capac- 
ity for making and keeping ?" is too 
often the gauge of a man's great- 
ness in these modern times. A false 
standard, unworthy of a great na- 
tion and a great people. 

What a predicament the world 
would be in if our Heavenly Father 
should act upon tliat principle? 
God's greatness is shown not so 
much by His ability to create and 
possess, as by His willingness to 
bestow, to give, to share, to min- 
ister to the welfare and happiness 
of His children, to provide ways 
and means for their advancement, 
opening for them the avenues of 
progress leading to those summits 
of glory which He Himself has at- 
tained. And He expects us to be 
like Him, to emulate His example, 
to be perfect even as He is perfect, 
according to our sphere. 

Thank heaven there are some 
men and some women who bow not 
down to the god of gold ; men and 
women who are not for sale ; men 
and women with whom the Giver, 
not the gift, is supreme. Such a 
man was the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Such were his associates and his 
successors. Such men lead us to- 
day, and such are all true Latter-day 
Saints, the world over. 

Such a man was Orson Pratt, a 
true and genuine Apostle. "A rich 
man," said President John Taylor 
at his funeral. Yes, for "he who 
hath eternal life is rich." Eternal 
riches was his quest. In moderate, 
even lowly circumstances, so far as 
this world's wealth was concerned, 
he was rich in powers of mind and 
accumulations of knowledge ; an in- 
tellectual and a spiritual millionaire.

Tribute to founders and leaders of the 
Church. — Repentance and righteous- 
.ness inculcated. — Characteristics of a 
righteous man. 

After listening to the eloquent re- 
marks which have just been made, 
and thinking of the many good 
things which have been said during 
the sessions of this conference, I 
feel very much as Alexander ex- 
pressed himself at the death of his 
father, Philip, that there was noth- 
ing more left to be done; because 
it does seem to me that the doctrines 
of the gospel of Christ, that the 
ideals which it holds up to us, and 
which we are all expected to seek 
after and to emulate, have been so 
fully expounded that no man or 
woman who has been present need 
leave this assembly, this great con- 
ference gathering, in doubt as to his 
duty or her duty as a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. For me to attempt to 
continue the subject treated by 
Elder Whitney would be like com- 
ing down from Point Lookout, on 
the Emigration Canyon railroad, in- 
to Liberty Park, in order that we 
might view the beauties of this val- 
ley. But his remarks have sug- 
gested one thought, a thought to 
which I shall venture to give a few 
moments discussion, and in order to 
emphasize it I will first read this 
brief verse from Proverbs, "Right- 
eousness exalteth a nation, but sin is 
a reproach to any people." 

I would like to amplify that and 
say that as righteousness exalteth a 
nation, so it exalteth a community, 
so it exalteth an individual: and as 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



71 



sin is a reproach to any people, so 
is sin a reproach to any individual. 
The one outstanding characteristic 
in the life of Orson Pratt — and 
when I refer to Orson Pratt I refer 
also to those men with whom he was 
associated, and with whom he la- 
bored^ — the one thing which has al- 
ways appealed to me, the one thing 
which stands out in bold relief above 
all others, is the righteousness of 
their lives. They were not sinful 
men, but men who sought to do 
God's will, men who loved the Lord 
with all their hearts, men who de- 
voted their lives to the welfare of 
humanity, because they loved their 
fellow man. To sin is to transgress 
the laws of God, and this they did 
not do. To sin is to be disobedient 
to the divine will, and this they did 
not do. To sin is to violate the 
command of God, either in purpose 
or in conduct ; this they did not do. 
To sin is to perform any act which 
we know to be wrong, or to leave 
undone any known duty. 

I love the memory of these men, 
the memory of the men who 
founded the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, men whose 
history has been written into the 
pages of the history of this Church, 
and the men who are now associated 
with it, directing its destinies, and 
managing its affairs, because I 
know them to be righteous men, and 
I know that God will exalt them. I 
know that He will exalt and mag- 
nify His people because of right- 
eousness, not that righteousness 
prevails perhaps to the degree that 
it might, not that we are all entirely 
free from sin, not that we all do the 
will of the Father as we ought, not 
that there are not some of us who 
violate the command of God in pur- 
pose and in conduct, — but I sincere- 
ly believe, and that belief is the re- 



sult of careful observation as I as- 
sociate with the people, the great 
masses of Latter-day Saints are 
like these men, these historic men 
whose memory we hold so dear. 
They are righteous men and women. 

Let me appeal to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, you Latter-day 
Saints who are here this afternoon, 
that you remember this scripture 
which I have read, the far reaching 
importance of it, the effect upon the 
lives of individuals, communities 
and nations of works of righteous- 
ness, its effect for good, and the 
far reaching effect of evil, of trans- 
gression of the law of God, of sin- 
ful practices of sinful acts. If my 
brethren and sisters could think of 
this important question as I think 
of it, I feel certain that there would 
not b.e a soul in the Church whose 
resolution would not be to serve the 
Lord their God, and if there are 
sins, if there are those who have 
transgressed, thank the Lord for the 
doctrine of repentance, for He has 
provided that sinful men and wom- 
en, men and women who have trans- 
gressed His laws may repent and 
receive a remission of their sins. I 
believe you will all agree with me 
that the tendency of the world at 
large is towards transgression of 
God's laws. Men and women are 
inclined to be sinful, and sin shuts 
us out from the presence of God 
and results in spiritual blindness and 
death, and so must we have contin- 
ued forever, had not the Lord in 
His mercy, through the atonement 
of Plis Son Jesus Christ, provided 
that through repentance from sin we 
may be forgiven, and our sins be 
blotted out and remembered against 
us no more. We may thus be re- 
established in the faith of our fath- 
ers, and in the fellowship of our 
brethren and our sisters.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ taught repentance from 
sin. John the Baptist proclaimed 
repentance, called upon people to 
forsake their sinful habits, to be 
baptized in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ for the remission of 
sins, and he declared to them that 
He who should come after, who was 
greater than he, would baptize them 
with fire and with the Holy Ghost, 
the Spirit of the Lord which forti- 
fies us against sin when we have 
received it. And so the transgressor 
is not left without hope of everlast- 
ing life. It is only required of him 
that he come back to the Lord in 
humility, that he come back to Him 
in faith, that he repent of his wrong- 
doing. This it was which brought 
joy to the father of the prodigal son, 
not that he had been a transgressor, 
not that he had wasted his sub- 
stance, not that he had consorted 
with wicked men and women. This 
did not make him better, far from 
it, but when repentance came to his 
heart and he returned and said, 
"Father I have sinned against heav- 
en and before thee, and I am no 
longer worthy to be called thy son. 
I am willing to come back as thy 
servant, to serve thee henceforth, 
only that I may be forgiven." The 
heart of the father was touched. 
Why? Because this my son who 
was dead, this my son who had gone 
away from the truth, my son who 
had forgotten the Lord, forgotten 
me his father, is alive again. He 
has repented of his sins, he has seen 
his error, he has come back to me, 
and I forgive him with all my heart. 
And he rejoiced, just as the good 
shepherd rejoiced who, leaving the 
ninety-nine sheep which he had 
•carefully gathered into the fold, 
went out into the storm and sleet 
of the mountain to look for the one 
lamb which had been lost, and when 



he found it he came back rejoicing 
because he had found that which 
was lost. 

Christ bore witness to us that 
there was greater rejoicing in heav- 
en over one sinner who shall repent 
and come back to the Lord, than 
over ninety-nine just men who need 
no repentance. He did not mean 
by that to depreciate the value of 
righteousness and the appreciation 
in which God our Father holds 
righteous men and women who have 
been faithful all their lives, but to 
illustrate the awful condition of a 
fallen soul ; to illustrate the condi- 
tion of one who denies God and 
gives way to sin, and is left with- 
out hope of everlasting life. When 
such a one returns it is like one re- 
deemed from the dead. So, my 
brethren and sisters, men and wom- 
en, our Father has placed us here 
that we may preach repentance to 
our fellows, extend the hand of 
sympathy to those who are in error, 
that we may redeem, if in our 
power it lies, the sinner in our 
midst, and bring him back into the 
fold of Christ. This characterized 
the lives of the men who founded 
this Church. This characterized the 
lives of all men and women who 
have believed in Jesus Christ as 
the Redeemer of the world, and it 
ought to characterize the life of 
every Latter-day Saint. 

As I contemplate the truths of 
the gospel which have been ex- 
pounded at this conference, this 
conviction comes to me, that I must 
be a righteous man, and yet I must 
not be a self-righteous man. I must 
be righteous in humility before the 
Lord, never glorying in my own 
strength, lest I fall. I must be a 
charitable man, and yet I must, be 
just, for whenever my charity shall 
prompt me to subvert justice, that

which is righteous and right, I have 
perverted that great command of 
the Almighty. I must be tolerant 
in my views, but my tolerance must 
not lead me to indulgence, or to 
approve of indulgence in others. I 
must tolerate them in righteousness, 
in that which has the approval of 
the Lord and all good men, but not 
farther than that, for the Lord can- 
not look upon sin with any degree 
of allowance. I must be temper- 
ate, and teach others temperance. 
1 must be truthful and teach truth 
to other people. I must be liberal, 
but I must not be extravagant, be- 
cause that would be displeasing to 
the Lord. I must be an industrious 
man, laboring, striving after those 
things which are necessary in order 
that my wants and the wants of my 
family and the necessities of the 
Church of which I am a member 
may be provided for ; but in my in- 
dustry, in my desire to acquire and 
accumulate I must not be selfish. 
I must not seek to unrighteously 
possess myself of that which be- 
longs to another, but carefully con- 
sider the welfare, the rights, prop- 
erty rights of my brethren and sis- 
ters. I may be ambitious, for the 
Lord desires that we shall strive for 
better things ; but my ambition, the 
accomplishment of my own pur- 
poses must never be at the expense 
of that which properly belongs to 
my fellows. I must not destroy or 
tear down in order that I may build 
myself up, but in humility labor, 
accepting that which comes to me 
with gratitude to the Lord, seeking 
to add to it by righteous means. I 
must be charitable ; I must love my 
fellow .men ; I must seek to admin- 
ister to him. In other words, I 
must do just what this passage of 
scripture says I ought to do. I 
must endeavor in mv life to be gfov- 



erned by principles of righteousness 
and not transgress either in pur- 
pose or in conduct the command- 
ments of the Lord my God. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, if 
we can all go out with this truth 
fixed in our hearts, resolved that as 
the Lord gives us strength so will 
we become, if we are not already, 
so will we continue who are al- 
ready, to be righteous men and 
women, fearing to do wrong, dar- 
ing always to do that which is right, 
advocating the truth, with our faces 
firmly but not aggressively set 
against evil of all kinds, that we 
may not be intense partisans, but 
that we may with firmness, consis- 
tency, and humility continue true 
to the commandments which God 
has given us, advocating them in 
the world and exemplifying them 
in our lives. Then, the Lord will 
always be with us, and He will mag- 
nify and exalt us, and He will make 
us what He desires that this Church 
shall be, a light to all the world, 
setting examples worthy of emula- 
tion, that other men and women, 
seeing them, may be led to glorify 
the name of God our Father and to 
repent of their sins and keep His 
commandments. To this end may 
the Lord bless us and help us, I 
pray through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith an- 
nounced that another overflow 
meeting will be held in the Assem- 
bly Hall, at 2 p. m., also, if neces- 
sary, an outdoor meeting will be 
held outdoors, near the Bureau of 
Information, at the same hour. 

The male members of the choir 
sang the hymn : 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee'; 

. Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 
Majestic rises on the world.

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., Sunday, Oct. 8th, 1911. 
The services were presided over by 
Elder Hyrum M. Smith. 

The Temple choir under direc- 
tion of Prof. C. J. Thomas, ren- 
dered the musical exercises. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Sweetly may the blessed Spirit 
On each faithful bosom shine ; 

May we every grace inherit; 
Lord, we seek a boon divine. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Fer- 
dinand F. Hintze. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Ere long the vail will rend in twain, 
The King descend with all His train; 
The earth will shake with awful fright, 
And all creation feel His might. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 

(President Northern States Mission.) 

I am pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, to have the privilege of at- 
tending this general conference of 
the Church. I have been delighted 
and instructed by the counsel, ad- 
vice and admonition that we have 
received thus far. 

I sincerely pray that, while I oc- 
cupy the time, the Spirit of the 
Lord will direct me, that I may 
clearly express the thoughts that 
come to me while standing before 
you. In the opening address, our 



beloved President, touched upon 
many of the glorious things that 
were revealed by the Lord to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, for the ed- 
ucation and preparation of His 
children upon the earth, to help 
them to come back and dwell with 
Him. Among the others, there was 
one thought which has been beauti- 
fully expressed by the poet that 
struck me forcibly. It is found in 
the hymn, "O My Father," wherein 
it says : 

"I had learned to call Thee Father, 
Through Thy Spirit from on high] 

But, until the key of knowledge 
Was restored, I knew not why." 

Most little children in the earth 
have been taught by parents and 
teachers to worship some kind of a 
Supreme Being, and for lack of 
power to explain their God they 
have taught them to worship our 
Father as a reality. Naturally, they 
have looked upon "Our Father in 
Heaven" as a personal being, the 
prototype of men, and in whose 
image we were created. It is only 
when the children have grown older 
that they worship the Lord (if they 
worship at all), in the abstract. 
They try to worship a being with- 
out body, without parts, and with- 
out passions. In this regard, we 
were like the rest of the world un- 
til the restoration of the Gospel. 
But, when the "key of knowledge 
was restored," we then understood 
really who God and Christ are. 
They visited the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and revealed again Their 
true character to the world, which 
revelation enables us to know bet- 
ter than the rest of mankind who 
God and Christ are. As one, of the 
speakers quoted yesterday, "To 
know Thee, the only true God, and 
Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent, 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



75 



is life eternal." True, we have the 
scriptures that have been an aid in 
bringing much light and informa- 
tion into the world, but in addition 
to the ancient scriptures, we have 
the glorious revelations and mani- 
festations of our Heavenly Father 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, which light and 
truth is causing thousands in the 
denominations and sects of the 
world to also believe in a personal 
God. As Latter-day Saints we 
ought to rejoice in these things. It 
has also been revealed and taught 
to the Latter-day Saints that, asso- 
ciated with our Father in Heaven 
we have a Mother there. The 
poet, in the same verse partly quot- 
ed above, gave expression to this 
beautiful truth: 

"In the heavens are parents single? 

No; the thought makes reason stare! 
Truth is reason; truth eternal 

Tells me I've a Mother there." 

The people of the world, in a 
large measure, after eighty years 
have elapsed, are growing in belief 
in the consistency of this idea ; they 
are beginning to say if we had a 
Father in Heaven, we must have 
had a mother, and to sustain that 
thought they quote the scripture, 
"God created Adam and Eve in His 
own image, male and female cre- 
ated He them." 

During the late conference of the 
Northern States Mission, in Nau- 
voo, the fact was impressed upon 
my mind concerning the great lib- 
erty, rights and privileges that were 
asserted by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith should belong to women, in 
the organization of the Relief So- 
ciety of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. Since that 
time many organizations have 



sprung up among the women in this 
and other lands. They have been 
given a chance to become in very 
deed the helpmeets of men, and 
their equal in many of the walks of 
life. Today we find numerous soci- 
eties, clubs and organizations for 
the betterment, education and up- 
building of the women of the world. 
They have been given liberty, and 
opportunity for advancement far 
more since the Prophet Joseph 
Smith's day than in almost any oth- 
er period in the history of the 
world. This is in keeping with 
what was promised concerning the 
last days, that knowledge should be 
multiplied, and that "truth should 
spring out of the earth and right- 
eousness look down from heaven," 
not only for the blessing of men, 
but also for the women, for all of 
God's children, both male and fe- 
male. I believe that the light of the 
Gospel is now rapidly permeating 
the whole world, and particularly 
the Christian world, along the lines 
revealed to our great Latter-day 
Prophet, and these truths are being 
recognized as coming from the 
Lord. Thousands now are heard to 
express a belief in God as being 
our Father, and having some kind 
of personality. Some sectarian 
ministers are now preaching that 
Christ was the revelation of God 
the Father to the children of men; 
and, while many may still believe 
that He is a spirit, or an essence, or 
some other substance, they are 
tending toward an absolute belief 
that Christ was a resurrected man, 
or a resurrected Redeemer, with a 
body of flesh and bones. 

I believe, too, that the Christian 
world are fast growing to compre- 
hend the true mission of women in 
the earth. Particularly in the last 
few years is this manifest. The 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thinking- classes are now proclaim- 
ing to the world that the highest 
mission of women is to be mothers, 
and to seek to build up a better 
race — to sucessfully do their part in 
peopling the earth with a noble 
and intelligent class of citizens. In 
harmony with this idea, one of the 
present-day poets has expressed 
the same truth of motherhood in 
heaven as found in the "O My 
Father" hymn. I will read this to 
you, for it illustrates how the spirit 
of the Gospel is. taking hold of the 
children of our Father, and it is in 
harmony with the declaration of 
President Joseph F. Smith concern- 
ing light coming into the world 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The poem is entitled "Completion," 
by its author, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, 
but I have called it "Eternal Moth- 
erhood," and it is, as I have said, 
in harmony with the idea of our 
having a mother in heaven, and in 
harmony with the light that has 
been given to the world, in relation 
to this subject. 

When I shall meet God's generous 
dispensers 
Of all the riches in the heavenly- 
store, 

Those lesser gods, who act as recom- 
pensers 

For loneliness and loss upon this 
shore, 

Methinks, abashed, and somewhat 
hesitating, 
My soul its wish and longing will 
declare, 

Lest they reply: "Here are no boun- 
ties waiting: 
We gave on earth, your portion and 
your share." 

Then T shall answer: "Yea, T do re- 
member 

The many blessings to my life al- 
lowed; 

My June was always longer than De- 
cember, 

My sun was always stronger than 
my cloud, 



My joy was ever deeper than ray sor- 
row, 

My gain was ever greater than my 
loss, 

My yesterday seemed less than my 
tomorrow, 
The crown looked always larger 
than the cross. 

"I have known love in all its radiant 
splendor; 
It shone upon my pathway to the 
end. 

T trod no road that did not bloom 
with tender 
And fragrant blossoms planted by 
some friend. 

And those material things we call suc- 
cesses, 

In modest measure crowned my 

earthly lot, 
Yet was there one sweet happiness 

that blesses 
The life of woman which to me 

came not. 

"I knew the hope of motherhood; a 
season 

I felt a fluttering heart beat 'neath 
my own; 

A little cry — then silence. For that- 
reason 

I dare, to you, my only wish make 
known. 

The babe who grew to angelhood in 
heaven, 

I never watched unfold from child 
to man, 

And so I ask that unto me be given 
That motherhood which was God's 
primal plan. 

"All womankind He meant to share 
its glories. 
He meant us all to nurse our babes 
to rest, 

To croon them songs, to tell them 
sleepy stories, 
Else why the wonder of a woman's 
breast? 

He must provide for all earth's cheat- 
ed mothers 
In His vast space of shining sphere 
on sphere, 

And with my son there must be many 
others — 

My spirit children who will claim 
me here. 

"Fair creatures by my loving thoughts 
created — 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

Too finely fashioned for a mortal 
birth— 

Between the border of two worlds 
they waited 
Until they saw my spirit leave the 
earth. 

In God's great nursery they must be 
waiting 

To welcome me with many an in- 
fant wile. 

Now let me go and satisfy this long- 
ing 

To mother children for a little 
while." 

Now the light along this and 
every other line revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith is permeat- 
ing the hearts of the children of 
men, and though they have not ac- 
knowledged the source; the time 
will soon come when they will be 
glad to give credit where credit is 
due, and even praise the Lord for 
that source by which light and in- 
formation have been given to the 
world. The Latter-day Saints, 
above all people, have defended and 
upheld the high moral standard of 
woman, and her divine mission and 
work in the earth. The Lord has 
acknowledged their labors upon 
the earth ; He has borne witness 
in the hearts of the women that they 
are placed upon the earth to be 
mothers of the children of God, and 
in rearing their sons and daughters 
have joy and satisfaction. The 
women of Zion can rejoice and take 
heart in the great calling given 
them, in being privileged to be the 
earthly mothers of the elect sons of 
our Heavenly Father. God loves 
them, and has manifested that they 
are blessed above all other women 
of the earth. They will be thrice 
welcome in His kingdom for their 
faithfulness and devotion to their 
high calling of motherhood. 

May the light and intelligence 
that God has so abundantly given 
to the Latter-day Saints eventually 



permeate the hearts of all the chil- 
dren of men, till God's kingdom is 
established and His will be done in 
earth as it is done in heaven, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.,) 

Our beloved President, Joseph F. 
Smith, in his opening address to this 
conference, made reference to some 
of the material things In which the 
Church has been interested. It has 
caused me to think, my brethren 
and sisters, that God is interested in 
the material condition of His chil- 
dren, as much, perhaps, as He is in 
their spiritual welfare, for, to Him, 
all things are spiritual. I have dis- 
covered this, as you who have been 
preaching the gospel have also, that 
it is exceeding difficult to interest in 
our message men or women who are 
hungry, or who are in dire necessity 
for the things of life, or whose lives 
are so depressed by long hours of 
service that they are too tired to be- 
come interested in the gospel. 

Looking over the past, we dis- 
cover that God has always been in- 
terested in the material welfare of 
His children. How bounteously He 
has provided the things of' life that 
men are in need of, in the forming 
of the earth, in the organizing of 
the elements, in the soil and the 
water, the coal, iron and oil, the 
gold and the silver, and all things 
that are calculated to make life en- 
joyable upon the earth. And God 
designs that His bounties should be 
distributed in a just and right man- 
ner, that those who labor should en- 
joy the fruits of their labor, that the 
idler should "not eat the bread or 
wear the raiment of him who la- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bors," and that there should be a 
just and honorable distribution 
among all His children. In the 
early ages of the world He gave, 
together with many spiritual laws, 
temporal laws also for the material 
interests of His people, the observ- 
ance of which so perfected them in 
material as in spiritual things, that 
we are told of at least one great 
community who had "all things in 
common," and became perfect, so 
much so that God removed them 
from the knowledge of the world, or 
at least from that particular part of 
the earth, so that their place of habi- 
tation has not yet been discovered 
by men. I refer to Enoch and his 
people, whom the scriptures say 
were translated because of their per- 
fection. Again, among the laws 
God gave to Moses He conde- 
scended to speak of material things. 
Many of these laws were intended 
as a "schoolmaster" to bring them 
to greater things that God had in 
mind for them, both spiritual and 
temporal. 

When Jesus ministered among 
men He announced advanced spir- 
itual laws, and, in all probability, He 
gave information with respect to 
material things as well. I cannot 
think that the apostles, of their own 
initiative, began to establish that or- 
der of things that made them to 
have "all things in common," so that 
the people brought, the scriptures 
tell us, all their earthly things and 
put them down at the apostles' feet 
for a common store. So also in the 
establishment of this latter-day 
work, God has likewise been con- 
cerned for the material welfare of 
His people. Many of the revela- 
tions given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, deal with temporal things, 
imparting information calculated to 
be an essential blessing to the peo- 



ple. The Prophet, himself, was in- 
structed to labor for the material 
welfare of the people, in the build- 
ing of cities, and in assisting to es- 
tablish mercantile and other insti- 
tutions looking to the benefit of the 
people ; he seemed to keep these ma- 
terial things in mind, so much so 
that many on the outside have found 
fault with the Prophet on this ac- 
count. I believe that they who com- 
plain have not properly understood 
the object the Church had in these 
matters. 

I begin to realize the necessity of 
the Church taking interest in more 
than the spiritual welfare of the 
people, and I notice that this idea 
is growing in many of the leading 
churches of today. Recently a - cer- 
tain congregation in the east, reply- 
ing to questions sent to them by the 
minister as to why they did not at- 
tend church, expressed themselves 
as being dissatisfied with what they 
heard there. One of the delinquent's 
said : "The reason is, you are al- 
ways telling me about the time that 
I am going to wear a white robe; 
why don't you tell me how to get a 
few white shirts now?" I believe 
that feeling will continue to grow. 
There is complaint against the min- 
isters, who are referred to as "sky 
pilots," that they live above the 
things of the earth, and are soaring 
beyond the comprehension of man- 
kind, who are in need of assistance 
in the settlement of problems that 
ought to be solved now. Not that 
we contend the church should usurp 
the functions of the state, but, 
wherein the state lacks in minister- 
ing to the wants of the people, the 
church should provide for those 
wants. 

We have discovered in the reve- 
lations of God to this Church, that 
He has provided, even in the mi- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



79 



nutest detail, for the government of 
the life of each member, his physical 
conduct as well as his spiritual regu- 
lation. For example, we are told 
we should "retire early to rest, and 
arise early, that we might be invig- 
orated and refreshed;" that we 
should abstain from the use of tea, 
' coffee, tobacco, liquor and other 
things that are injurious. Attention 
has also been paid to regulating the 
amusements of the people, in the 
dance, the theatre, etc. Members of 
other churches have ignored these 
dangers,' and permit their children, 
in many instances, to mingle with 
men and women who have no char- 
acter ; nor do they seem to feel any 
responsibility for the moral welfare 
of their young men and women. We 
believe that the Church was justified 
in taking into consideration the 
needs of its boys and girls, and pro- 
viding for them necessary and prop- 
er amusement. We believe that the 
Church has been justified in looking 
to the material welfare of the peo- 
ple in all directions. 

Not long ago, an editor in the 
city of Vancouver, B. C, made an 
attack upon us, sarcastically, saying 
that we ought to go to the back- 
doors of Europe and bring the poor 
out to our communities, and make 
them till the soil, and then extract 
one-tenth of their earnings from 
them, that being the method, he 
said, by which the Church has be- 
come wealthy. ' It is no reproach 
upon us for preaching to the poor ; 
don't you remember it was the poor 
that had the gospel preached unto 
them in the days of the Savior? If 
a tenth of their earnings has made 
the Church "immensely rich," what 
has the nine-tenths done for those 
who were before always dependent, 
having to go to the poor house when 
old age came upon them, and never 



knowing the joy of owning' their 
own homes. It is true that in the 
days that are past the Church did, 
through the Perpetual Emigration 
Fund, aid many men and women to 
come from the land of their nativ- 
ity to this glorious land, and as- 
sisted them in becoming located up- 
on the soil, helped them to acquire 
homes,- and saw them become inde- 
pendent, ninety per cent, we are 
told, eventually owning their own 
homes. The Church influenced them 
to construct irrigation ditches ; and 
lent them aid and assistance in many 
ways. It helped them in the dis- 
posal of their crops ; it assisted in 
the construction of a railroad, that 
enabled the products of the coun- 
try abroad to be brought in, and 
the shipping out of products grown 
or manufactured here. Before the 
days of the railroad, the Church in- 
terested itself in the beet sugar in- 
dustry, bringing machinery across 
the plains with ox-teams ; but ow- 
ing to the people not understanding 
beet culture as they do today, that 
enterprise was a failure then. But 
today, that industry has been estab- 
lished very largely through the ef- 
forts of the Church, so that beet 
farmers are now the most inde- 
pendent farmers in the community, 
they are well to do, as a rule, and 
this industry has been a great bless- 
ing to them in many respects. 

The Church authorities saw the 
prices that were charged by trans- 
ient merchants who brought their 
goods here to be sold, and, by their 
instigation, a commercial institution 
was organized, which purchased 
goods in large quantities, shipped 
them in cheaply, and, by selling to 
the people at reasonable figures, it 
became a great blessing to the men 
and women struggling here for a 
livelihood, and for means to rear 



80

and educate their children. This 
institution has since been a great 
price leveler. The Church sought 
to establish woolen mills, iron 
works, shoe factories, and other en- 
terprises calculated to be a blessing 
to the people. It did not leave them 
in ignorance, but built school houses 
and meeting houses, and gave them 
opportunities to acquire informa- 
tion, until now our state ranks third 
among all the states in our Union 
in the matter of our education. No 
wonder the "Mormon" men and 
women pay their tithing; they have 
received abundant returns in the 
numerous blessings that have flowed 
to them in a material way and also 
in a spiritual way. They have never 
been robbed by the Church, and 
have no reason to complain, but 
many reasons to rejoice. 

I do not raise any objection to 
the Church interesting itself in en- 
terprises for the blessing of the 
community. I expect to see the day 
when the Church will aid even more 
than it is doing now. The law of 
tithing was calculated to be only as 
a "school master" to bring us to 
greater and better things. The 
greater and better things are that 
we shall reach that condition when 
we shall practice and enjoy that sys- 
tem of Enoch, which was revealed 
to the Prophet Joseph, and the keys 
of which are held by the Latter-day 
Saints today. This will eventually 
bring us to enjoy on an equality the 
material wealth of the world, so that 
we shall have no rich and no poor, 
and have no oppression of one by 
another. Men shall love each other, 
otherwise there would be no reign 
of peace, no millennium. 

We have no quarrel with our So- 
cialist friends. While we recognize 
they have some truth, yet what the 
world needs, more than socialistic 



system and methods, is a people so 
trained that they can keep them- 
selves in line, and maintain high 
ideals and standards. Why was it 
that many of the communities that 
were founded and established to col- 
onize and develop the west, outside 
of the Latter-day Saints, failed? A 
man in Portland recently told me 
there was something remarkable 
about our people, as he recounted 
the failures of others and our suc- 
cesses. I stated, it is the unity of 
our faith, constituting within us a 
strong binding force, so that we 
have been enabled to stand togeth- 
er for a long period without get- 
ting results, not becoming discour- 
aged, but continuing mutually 
working for the common good. 

Let me tell you that the solution 
of the great problem that is con- 
fronting the world today, between 
capital and labor, shall be complete- 
ly solved through the instrumental- 
ity that God has devised, and 
through the faithfulness of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. An ensign, and a 
pattern to the world in these things, 
shall be raised and established 
through the men and women who 
have obeyed the "school-master." 
and are prepared to learn better and 
higher things. Let us fix our -eyes 
upon these things, for the Lord has 
decreed they shall be established. 
The men and women who do not 
obey the "schoolmaster," and keep 
themselves up to the standard of 
that law, will not keep the higher 
law. That man and that woman 
who pay their tithes, thereby wit- 
nessing that they are indebted to 
God, showing that they are but 
leasers of the portion of earth upon 
which they dwell, giving to Him 
grateful acknowledgment of His 
rightful ownership of it. and com- 
plying with the conditions upon

which final ownership may be se- 
cured to them as an everlasting in- 
heritance, unto them only will there 
be given the greater things. 

Every man and woman ought to 
feel thankful unto trie Lord for the 
glorious privileges that we have of 
being material assistance unto the 
Church. I know it is a splendid 
system that has been devised and 
given to the Latter-day Saints. God 
wants to make us unselfish : He 
wants to make us generous. -He 
loves a generous giver, and He pro- 
vides such with what He designs 
they shall bestow. He wants, not 
our dollars, but our hearts. In 
giving, our hearts should go with 
the gifts, this makes us truly lib- 
eral, as He is liberal. 

The father and mother who are 
constantly giving to their children, 
providing them education and giv- 
ing them social position, as well as 
the necessaries and comforts of life, 
and denying ^themselves; .personal 
comforts in order to bestow the 
means upon their children, should 
have respect, grateful acknowledg- 
ment, and honor from their boys 
and girls. I have looked with sor- 
row upon boys and girls who have 
been indulged by their parents and 
then -complained that they did not 
get more, that they were not given 
a better hat, or a better suit of 
clothes, and thus brought grief to 
their parents who were doing all 
they could for them, even with great 
sacrifice to themselves. I have 
looked with sorrow upon fathers 
and mothers under such conditions 
as these, when their children 
seemed to be ungrateful. What is 
the return that the father and moth- 
er want? They merely desire that 
their son or daughter acknowledge 
their obligation for the generous 
support and provision that is made 



for them. Such boys and girls 
ought to go to their fathers and 
mothers, put their arms around 
them and kiss them and say, God 
bless you father, God bless you 
mother, I appreciate your sacrifice, 
and I want to do something for 
you. What can I do? That pays 
and compensates the heart of that 
father and mother. 

God is like our fathers and moth- 
ers in His great, grand scheme of 
giving to and providing for His 
children, and He is grieved when 
He sees us receiving ungratefully 
the good things that He provides, 
coveting what He gives to others, 
and begrudging that which ' we 
should return as a tribute to Him. 
God loves to see a spirit of thank- 
fulness manifested by His children. 

God bless us and help us to keep 
fixed in our hearts and minds these 
things that He has revealed to us. 
Let us labor through these years 
of preparation — for we are in a 
state of preparation — to accom- 
plish what the Lord has laid out 
for us to do, not only for our own 
salvation but for that of our chil- 
dren and, as much as lies in our 
power, for the salvation of all our 
brethren and sisters in the earth. 
God help us to live up to these high 
ideals, and merit His promised 
blessings, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir rendered a selection, 
entitled, "Hushed was the evening 
hymn." 

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL.

The Latter-day Saints are known

mony as the sons and daughters of 
God. In listening to the remarks of 
those who have preceded me, I am 
strengthened in that thought, which 
I desire to dwell upon, that is, that 
we are looking forward to even a 
stronger degree of unity, not only 
unity in faith, but in material af- 
fairs as well. To attain to this po- 
sition, I am inclined to advise, that 
those who are blessed today with 
the material things of life should 
restrain themselves a little, that they 
should hold back in the expendi- 
ture of funds upon their children, 
that there might, consequently, be a 
more equal condition. I regret to 
notice, without any disposition to 
criticize, however, the tendency to- 
wards classification. I have ob- 
served in our Church schools that 
parents who can afford to dress 
them well, are allowing their girls 
to attend school clad in silks and 
satins, with their heads adorned by 
expensive hats, and some of the 
boys also are dressed in the finest 
of fashionable clothing. The boys 
and girls that develop in this life 
to the best men and women, are 
usually children of poor parents. 
This habit I am speaking of to some 
extent humiliates' the feelings of 
those not well off. 

I notice that there has been im- 
provement among the ladies in that 
they have acquired the habit of un- 
covering their heads in our meet- 
ings. There is a better condition 
in tliis respect, they are thus on an 
equality, not trying to outdo one an- 
' other, or to distract the attention 
of the congregation. This is enough 
to make us feel better for the 
change. 

If you carefully observe the men 
and women who have made the best 
of this life, you will find that gener- 
ally, they are those whose parents 



have not been able to squander 
means on their sons and daughters. 
At Berkley, California, one of the 
lecturers in the Summer School 
made this observation, that we must 
get back to first principles again. 
I submit, my brethren and sisters, 
that we ought to get back those 
sweet feelings that we enjoyed when 
the Saints would walk long dis- 
tances to congregate, that they 
might have a good shake of the 
hands and meet on equality. I re- 
member the early days in this val- 
ley, when our mothers wore the 
same kind of bonnets, and dressed 
in calico, they did not envy each 
other, they were all equal. But, I 
do not consider there is anything 
too good for the children of God, if 
we don't worship it. There is no 
fabric, too nice for the pure daugh- 
ters of God. It is the flaunting of 
rich clothing in such a way as to 
annoy those who are less fortunate 
in life that creates inequality and 
hurts the feelings of the people. I 
do hope, my brethren and sisters, 
that we will endeavor to restrain 
ourselves in the follies and fashions 
of the world. In my experience I 
have learned that the men and wom- 
en we love most are not those who 
dress the finest, but are those who 
make the best of the opportunities 
presented to them. The man and 
woman that we place in any posi- 
tion any time we need them, are 
they who will work cheerfully and 
do anything that is desired of them. 
We can depend upon such men. 
whether it be in the digging of a 
ditch or speaking in the. pulpit, 
whatever they may be called upon to 
do. 

Regarding our missionaries, some 
of our Elders spend too much mon- 
ey in the world. While traveling

most absolutely without purse or 
scrip. It is to be regretted that 
some of our boys now find they 
have not enough faith to preach 
without purse or scrip in the world. 
We want our boys to go out among 
the people and win their way. "The 
laborer is worthy of his hire." I 
always thought it an unfair propo- 
sition that, when we go out and give 
our time, and make the sacrifice of 
the comforts of home, to carry the 
pearl of great price to the world, 
that the people are not willing to 
give us our food and a bed to sleep 
in. I think it is a mistake for us to 
spend so much money, we are not 
training the people of the world a- 
right in that direction. I have ex- 
perienced it, and know what I am 
talking about. In my own experi- 
ence, and in association with other 
ciders, I have found we have suc- 
ceeded best when we went with- 
out purse or scrip. 

In this great educational period 
every boy and girl must go to 
school, we want them to go and 
we desire that they should have edu- 
cational privileges. But what is it 
doing for us at home? If we want 
to have a weak generation of boys 
and girls give them a fine educa- 
tion and all the money they want 
for fashionable clothes and amuse- 
ments. The rank and file of this 
people, the substantial element up- 
on whom God may rely, will go 
right along avoiding extremes, and 
can always be depended upon. If 
we are going to reach the splendid 
condition Brother Ballard has been 
telling us about, it will be by re- 
straining ourselves, getting back in- 
to the ranks, and using the com- 
mon sense God has given us, not 
following after the foolish fashions 
of the world. I submit it matters 
little what the position may be, as 



a rule the strongest, the happiest, 
the best, and the wisest of men are 
those who dress simply and live 
simply, who work for the good of 
humanity. May God grant that we 
shall all realize these things, and 
march in the ranks with the people 
of God, who are building up His 
kingdom and accomplishing His 
purposes upon the earth, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

The question asked by one of 
old was, "Canst thou by searching 
find out God?" It is interesting to 
me to observe man's efforts, with- 
out the aid of divine revelation, to 
find out God. I would not dis- 
parage the argument from creature 
to creator, from design to designer; 
and yet I appreciate the limitations 
that there are to that line of argu- 
ment. We have in scripture some 
instances of this process of reason- 
ing "from nature up to nature's 
God." For instance, the Psalmist 
David exclaims : "The heavens de- 
clare the glory of God, and the 
firmament showeth his handiwork. 
Day unto day uttereth speech, and 
night unto night showeth knowl- 
edge. There is no speech nor lan- 
guage where their voice is not 
heard." There is also in the Book 
of Mormon a beautiful instance that 
occurs in connections with the con- 
troversy between Korihor, the anti- 
Christ, and Alma, the great high 
priest. Korihor had been putting 
forth his agnostic arguments, and 
Alma meets him, in part, with this 
remark: "The scriptures are laid 
before thee, yea, and all things de- 
note there is a God ; yea, even the 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



earth and all things that are upon 
the face of it, yea, and its motion; 
yea, and also all the planets which 
move in their regular form, doth 
witness that there is a Supreme 
Creator." 

I noticed in the last number of 
the Improvement Era a beautiful 
selection along this line — 

There is a God. The herbs of the 
valley, the cedars of the mountains, 
bless Him ; the insect sports in his beam ; 
the bird sings Him in the foliage; the 
thunder proclaims Him in the heavens ; 
the ocean declares His immensity; man 
alone has said, "There is no God." Unite 
in thought at the same instant the most 
beautiful objects in nature. Suppose 
that you see at once all the hours of the 
day, and all the seasons of the year — 
a morning of spring and a morning of 
autumn — a night bespangled with stars 
and a night darkened with clouds — 
meadows enameled with flowers — for- 
ests hoary with snow — fields gilded by 
the tints of autumn — then alone you 
will have a just conception of the uni- 
verse ! While you are gazing on that 
sun which is plunging into the vault of 
the west, another observer admires him 
emerging from the gilded gates of the 
east. By what inconceivable power does 
that aged star, which is sinking fatigued 
and burning in the shades of evening, 
reappear at the same instant fresh and 
humid with the rosy dew of the morn- 
ing? At every hour of the day, the 
glorious orb is at once rising, resplen- 
dent as noon-day, and settling in the 
west; or rather, our senses deceive us, 
and there is properly speaking, no east 
or west, no north or south in the world. 

Proctor, the astronomer who once 
paid a just tribute to Orson Pratt 
whose memorial services are being 
celebrated today, Richard A. Proc- 
tor, in introducing his work en- 
titled "Other Worlds than Ours," 
uses a scriptural quotation — "Lo, 
these are but a portion of His ways" 
— meaning the ways of the universe, 
the marvels of> the- universe — "Lo 
these are but a portion of His ways, 
they are but a whisper of His glory, 



and the thunder of His power who* 
can comprehend?" And yet, not- 
withstanding all the evidences that 
we have of the. existence of Deity — 
and the strong and legitimate argu- 
ment that we have from design to 
designer, yet that is not of itself 
sufficient to reveal unto us all the 
attributes of God. Mr. Herbert 
Spencer, the great naturalist, after a 
life time in the study of nature, de- 
clared, 

But one truth must ever grow clearer, 
the truth that there is an Inscrutable 
Existence everywhere manifested to 
which we can neither find or conceive 
beginning or end. 

Again, 

Amid the mysteries which become the 
more mysterious the more they are 
thought about, there will remain this 
one absolute certainty, that we are ever 
in the presence of an Infinite Energy, 
from which all things proceed. 

Sir Oliver Lodge declared : 

To my mind a great world-soul in- 
timately connected with our own, is the 
most reasonable explanation of the pro- 
cess by which things came to be. 

But notwithstanding this process 
of reason, we should not lose sight 
of the fact that without revelation 
we could not know all the attributes 
of God — could not. "find out the 
Almighty unto perfection." 

Peter tells us in holy writ that, 
"all flesh is as the grass and the 
glory of man as the flower of. grass. 
The grass withereth and the flower 
thereof falleth away; but the word 
of the Lord endureth forever. And 
this is the word which by the gospel 
is preached unto you." Just as the 
statue of the Prophet Joseph and the 
statue of his brother the Patriarch 
stand upon granite foundations, so 
the gospel of salvation is grounded 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



85 



upon the granite bedrock of ever- 
lasting truth. It is an interesting 
fact that philosopher, poet and 
statesman, have grasped something 
of the great gospel truths. For in- 
stance, Joseph Smith placed empha- 
sis upon the doctrine of faith. We 
have Sir Oliver Lodge asserting: 
"Faith and trust in the love and 
goodness underlying the universe 
seems to me to be the most vital and 
helpful thing." 

Emerson exclaims : 

Belief and love, — a believing love will 
lift from your shoulders a vast load of 
care. O, my brothers, God exists. There 
is a soul at the center of nature and over 
the will of every man so that none of 
us can wrong the universe. * * The 
whole course of things goes to teach 
us faith. We need only obey. There 
is goodness for each of us and by lowly 
listening, we shall hear toe right word. 

Carlyle gives us to understand 
that skepticism means not intellec- 
tual doubt alone, but moral doubt; 
all sorts of infidelity, insincerity and 
spiritual paralysis. That our minds 
are not given us to doubt with and 
cavil with but to come to some sure 
understanding upon matters con- 
cerning which we are to act. 

Hugo tells us : 

We live by affirmation, quite as much 
as we do by bread. That faith is a ne- 
cessity, and woe to the man who be- 
lieves nothing. 

' Carlyle also reminds us that 

For man's well-being, faith is proper- 
ly the one thing needful; how with it 
martyrs otherwise weak,, can cheerfully 
endure the shame and the cross; and 
without it, weaklings puke up their sick 
existence by suicide in the midst of 
luxury. 

Tolstoi, in his book, "What I Be- 
lieve." confesses — 

I only passed from Nihilism to the 



church, because I felt the impossibility 
of living without faith— without a knowl- 
edge of what is good and evil, resting 
on something more than upon animal 
instincts. 

Take the words of the statesman 
in addition to that of the philoso- 
pher. We have Senator Beveridge 
in his work, "The Young Man and 
the World,", advising the young- 
man who is about to become a 
teacher to see first to this question 
of faith : — "Speaking as one of the 
men of the street, as one of the mil- 
lions, I think the best thing for you 
to attend to is this question of faith, 
Faith is only another name for 
power." Look to your faith then 
you who seek to save the souls of 
men. The Prophet Joseph taught 
the true relation between faith and 
works. Likewise one of the poets 
approaches a statement of our own 
belief in these words : 

If faith produce not works, I see 
That faith is not a living tree. 
Thus faith and works together grow, 
No separate life they e'er may know. 
They're soul and body, hand and heart, 
What God hath joined, let no man part. 

So we might go on with the views 
of the philosopher, poet, and states- 
man, corroborating this principle 
upon which the Prophet Joseph 
gave us corrected information. 

There was published recently in 
Public Opinion a quotation from 
a speech or the writings of the 
great English premier, William E. 
Gladstone, in reference to the in- 
consistency of the skeptic. He said : 

I contend that the skeptic is of all men 
the most inconsistent and irrational. 
He uses a plea against religion which 
he never uses against anything he wants 
to do or any idea he wants to embrace, 
viz., demonstrative evidence. Every day 
and all day long he is acting on evi- 
dence not demonstrative. 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He then gives numerous illustra- 
tions, and goes on to say, 

But when he comes to religion, he is 
seized with a great religious scrupulos- 
ity and demands as a pre-condition of 
homage to God what every where else 
he 'dispenses with and then ends with 
thinking himself more rational than 
other people. 

This caused the editor of Public 
Opinion to remark : 

We who believe ought not to stand 
upon the defensive. We have a right 
to demand that unbelief offer us some 
explanation of the phenomena of life, 
and show us that it is more probable 
than our explanation. What is your ex- 
planation of an intelligible universe if 
there is no intelligible God who has 
made us and who made it? What 
is your explanation of the fact 
that whenever man has emerged 
from a purely animal condition that 
there are altars and priests and temples 
and worship, if, in all these centuries 
he has found that worship unmeaning 
and unreal? What is your explanation 
of the fact that after eighteen centuries 
of moral and intellectual development 
and criticism and controversy, the Bible 
is still the world's best seller? What 
is your explanation of the fact that 
wherever the life and teachings of Jesus 
of Nazareth have become known He is 
the most revered and loved of all the 
figures in human history? 

I think we have reached a stage 
in the history of "Mormonism" 
when we may properly assume the 
same attitude, and call upon the 
world to give its explanation of 
"Mormonism," of all the phenomena 
of "Mormonism." If individuals 
are not satisfied with the explana- 
tion that Joseph Smith gave of how 
he came by the Book of Mormon, 
and of the revelations contained 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
of the translation of those ancient 
documents comprising the Pearl of 
Great Price, and of all the other 
numerous phenomena of "Mormon- 
ism" — if they are not satisfied, I 



say, with his explanation of these 
things, then we may say to them, 
What is your explanation of how 
these marvelous books came into ex- 
istence? Are you satisfied with the 
Spaulding theory, of how the Book 
of Mormon came to be? Are you 
satisfied with the thought that Sid- 
ney Rigdon wrote the Book of 
Mormon, while, as a matter of fact, 
he never saw it until after it was 
published and handed to him by 
Parley P. Pratt? So we may de- 
mand the world's explanation of 
other phenomena of "Mormonism." 
The teachings of these brethren who 
have spoken during this conference 
up to this time are a part of this sys- 
tem of "Mormonism and what is 
your explanation, — let me ask those 
who do not believe, — of these 
things? A testimony of these 
truths was deliberately sealed by the 
blood of the Prophet. What is your 
explanation of the marvels of "Mor- 
monism ?" 

The responsibility rests upon the 
jury of the world who have access 
to the truth, to place a proper esti- 
mate upon the sincere testimony of 
the three witnesses, and of the eight 
witnesses, and the testimony of Jo- 
seph, and the testimony of the com- 
plete and perfect organization of 
the Church, and of the wonderful 
history of "Mormonism," and of all 
of its beautiful and divine doctrines. 

Time does not permit a develop- 
ment of this theme ; I can only sug- 
gest this line of thought to you. 
The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Come, all ye Saints who dwell on earth, 

Your cheerful voices raise, 
Our great Redeemer's love to sing, 

And celebrate His praise. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph E. Robinson.

SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder George 
Albert Smith presided. 

The Murray choir, under direc- 
tion of conductor W. F. Robinson, 
rendered the musical exercises. 

The choir rendered a sacred chor- 
us, entitled, "Sing and magnify." 

Prayer was offered by Elder R. 
S. Collett. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

awake ! my slumb'ring minstrel, 
Let my harp forget its spell ; 

Say, O say, in sweetest accents, 
Zion prospers, all is well. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

It is my earnest prayer that the 
remarks I shall offer at this meet- 
ing shall be dictated by the good 
spirit. More than any other people 
on the face of the earth, the Latter- 
day Saints should be impressed with 
the sense of duty. It will indeed be 
an unfortunate thing for this people 
if they ever, at any time, lose this 
sense of duty. We hear a great deal 
of talk in these days about our 
rights, rights we think we ought to 
enjoy. But, I believe that if we, 
especially the Latter-day Saints, 
would think more about our obliga- 
tions than our rights we would be 
a happier, a more devout and a 
more grateful people. 

Of all the people on the face of 
the earth, we should be the most 
grateful, for we have received more 
light and truth concerning spiritual 
things than have many of our fel- 



low men. God has blessed us with 
the fullness of the gospel. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith opened the 
heavenly worlds to view, and unto 
us, by the gift and the power of the 
Holy Ghost, hath been revealed 
truths that are withheld from the 
people of the world who do not 
hearken unto the counsels of God. 
Indeed, the gift of the Holy Ghost 
is a strong proof that God is no re- 
specter of persons, because to the 
poor and to the rich, the learned 
and the ignorant, if they believe and 
obey the gospel with sincere intent, 
is given the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
which "leads and guides into all 
truth." So then even the poor man 
who has never been in a university 
as a student may say, with Job, 
when given the Holy Ghost, "I 
know that my Redeemer liveth, and 
that in the latter day he shall stand 
upon the earth." He speaks from 
the heart, and this heart-knowledge 
is the most direct, the most con- 
vincing knowledge of the gospel 
that we can have. The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
faithfully pursuing its mission of 
preaching Christ and Him crucified. 
That is our mission, and, with 
God's help, we are pressing along 
our way. 

It has ever been the case that 
when new light and truth have been 
introduced into the world, the 
powers of darkness have bitterly 
fought the introduction of that light 
and truth. "Mormonism" stands 
for the introduction of the whole 
truth concerning Jesus, the Christ. 
You will recall, in the days when 
Wycliffe and Tyndall were trans- 
lating the Bible into the English 
language, that men and women 
might peruse the precious truths in 
that volume, the evil one stirred up 
the clergy against these men, 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



against the work that they were 
accomplishing, and with the sword 
and with the stake they fought the 
introduction of the Bible into the 
homes of the people; but the work 
was accomplished. One of these men 
gave up his life in order that the 
Bible might be translated into the 
English language and introduced 
into the homes of the people. God's 
word could not fail, for Jesus said, 
"Search the scriptures ; for in them 
ye think ye have eternal life ; and 
they are they which testify of me." 
That was the reason why Satan 
fought the translation of the Bible 
into the English language. His work, 
has ever been and ever will be, to 
fight the gospel and purposes of 
Jesus Christ. Men, philosophers, to- 
day ask the question, why, in the cen- 
turies past, did the clergy, above all 
people, fight the translation, — the 
diffusion of the knowledge the Bible 
contains amongst the people? We 
must look for the answer in the say- 
ing of the Savior already quoted : 
"Search the scriptures; * * they 
are they which testify of me," Satan 
did not want the people to search 
the scriptures, he wanted to keep 
the prophecies contained in the 
scriptures and the mission of the 
scriptures from being fulfilled. He 
sought to have the Bible withheld 
from the people, that they might be 
kept in ignorance of the divine son- 
ship of the Son of God. The time 
came when men began to deny their 
God. 

Look in the world today at the 
number of ministers denying the 
divinity of Jesus Christ. They ad- 
mit — and perhaps we ought to feel 
thankful for this gracious admission 
— they concede, that Jesus was a 
great teacher, a great man, but 
many of them deny His divinity, 
deny that he was the Redeemer of 



the world. God in His goodness 
and mercy decreed that He would 
raise up a witness for the Lord 
Jesus Christ, when men should be- 
gin to deny Him, a witness who 
might convince them that Jesus is 
indeed the Christ. God has caused 
to be brought forth another volume 
of .scripture, to testify to the divin- 
ity of the Lord Jesus Christ. Men 
said that the canon of scripture was 
full. They said that God had ceased 
to speak to men from heaven, and 
they seemed to rest in this belief 
until : 

An angel from on high, 

The long, long silence broke ; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words He spoke — 

Lo! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 

A sacred record lies concealed. 

Joseph Smith, by the gift and the 
power of God, translated the Book 
of Mormon. What are some of the 
beautiful truths that the sacred Ne- 
phite record teaches? Shining as 
gems of spiritual truth, these two 
great heavenly truths stand prom- 
inent : The Book of Mormon estab- 
lishes the truth of the Bible. The 
Book of Mormon declares that 
Jesus was and is the Christ, the 
Son of God, the Redeemer of the 
world. A book declaring these two 
glorious truths is surely entitled to 
a fair and serious consideration. 
Compare the difficulties, the trials 
and persecutions that Joseph Smith 
suffered, in bringing forth the Book 
of Mormon, with the treatment and 
persecution that overtook Wycliffe 
and Tyndall, who brought forth the 
Bible in the English language, and 
the similarity is absolutely start- 
ling. The reason for the persecu- 
tion in both cases is precisely the 
same, Jesus said, "Search the scrip- 
tures : for they are they which testi- 
fy of me." Men began to lose

faith in God when "Lo, from Cu- 
morah's lonely hill" was brought 
forth the Book of Mormon, that de- 
clares that Jesus was the Christ, and 
that men could not gain salvation 
except in and through and by the 
Lord Jesus Christ. And so the 
devil, knowing the power, knowing 
the light that was coming into the 
world, wielded all his powers in 
fighting that book, and its trans- 
lator. Joseph Smith gave up his life 
as a martyr; his life was taken to 
satisfy the cruel unrighteous de- 
mands, and the hatred of those 
wicked men who persecuted him 
even to death's door. 

In a short time, not long hence, 
philosophers, scholars and states- 
men will ask, why did the people 
fight the introduction of the Book 
of Mormon, which is such a glor- 
ious and a powerful witness for the 
Lord Jesus Christ? History will 
repeat itself, and this answer will be 
given : Jesus said, "Search the 
scriptures ; * * they are they 
which testify of me." The Book of 
Mormon is scripture, it is the word 
of God, it testifies of His Son, and 
because of that, evil powers sought 
to prevent its translation, and the in-' 
troduction of that sacred book into 
the homes of the people. 

My brethren and sisters, the. 
efforts of the evil one will surely 
fail, for the angel said unto Joseph, 
"The knowledge that this record 
contains shall go unto every nation 
and kindred and people." The pre- 
diction made by the angel to the 
prophet of God is being fulfilled, 
and it will be completely fulfilled in 
God's own due time. 

We are told in the scriptures that 
the Bible and the Book of Mormon 
shall be one in God's hand for the 
confounding of false doctrine. It 
was said of Joseph, who was sold 



into Egypt, that he should "push the 
people together to the ends of the 
earth." By the Bible and the Book 
of Mormon false doctrine is being 
confounded; and as God has put 
them together — "one in mine hand" 
— we say "What therefore God hath 
joined together, let not man put 
as'under." The Latter-day Saints, 
imbued with the sense of duty, feel- 
ing that upon them rests the obli- 
gation to preach this gospel, will 
go forth by the power of God in the 
discharge of their duty, until the 
testimony of Jesus, which is the 
"spirit of prophecy" shall spread 
over the world like a sea of glory, 
until it covers the earth from pole 
to pole. To this mission, God grant 
that we may ever be faithful, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

The inspirational remarks of 
President Smith at the opening of 
the conference suggested to my 
mind this question : Is it worth 
while to be an exemplary Latter- 
day Saint? Emerson said, "A man 
is relieved and gay when he has 
put his heart into his work and done 
his best, what he has said and done 
otherwise shall bring him no peace." 
I believe those words. 

In the missionary field we have 
opportunities for observing many 
things which do not ordinarily come 
to the attention of the people at 
home in the body of the Church and 
I call to mind an experience of re- 
cent date which will illustrate the 
point I would like to make : A pro- 
fessor of several years standing at 
the law school of Ann Arbor had 
moved to Colorado for his health, 



v 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and in talking with one of our mem- 
bers over a business proposition he 
made the remark, "I was in Ann 
Arbor for a number of years. I had 
occasion to know and see men who 
came there to study law and it was 
my observation that the young men 
who came from Utah, most of 
whom were known as 'Mormons,' 
were ahead of all others of the 
world that came to that institution. 
Let me ask you why," said he, 
"why is it that they made such rec- 
ords ?" The answer was given that, 
undoubtedly, it was because of the 
lives that those men had been urged 
to live ; that they had been taught in 
their youth to be virtuous, to abstain 
from alcoholic liquors and from to- 
bacco, tea, coffee and stimulants of 
every kind. "Well," be said, "if 
that be the case, I would to God that 
my children might be reared in such 
an atmosphere instead of where 
they are today." It is not only 
those, my friends, who go to school 
to Ann Arbor and the colleges of 
the East or West — it is not only to 
those we are to look for exemplary 
men and women, but it is to every 
one of us, and if we wish for it in 
our hearts to be exemplary in our 
manners, in our habits, we do more 
than any other one thing in the 
world to advocate "Mormonism." 

Let me give you another picture : 
A family with whom we became 
acquainted in Denver had visited 
a number of families in Utah, and 
we were invited to their home one 
evening to have dinner with a num- 
ber of others of their friends, and as 
coffee was placed before us and we 
declined they asked why it was, and 
the opportunity came for me to ex- 
plain that it was a part of our re- 
ligion, a tenet of our faith, that we 
abstain from the use of such things. 
"Why, that is a peculiar thing!" 



said the gentleman, "we have been 
out in Utah a number of times in 
the home of so and so," (and, by 
the way, the man he spoke of was 
a man of my own town and I knew 
him very well, — a man representa- 
tive in the Church, too), "and they 
have put both tea and coffee before 
us in their home and we never knew 
that your people had such a law in 
the Church." Now, it may have 
been that those good people, out of 
generosity in entertaining the vis- 
itors, desired them to have what 
they wanted. It was not a question, 
hardly, of deciding that they could 
put on the usual beverage, as was 
illustrated a few days ago through 
one of the illustrious men of this 
nation, in addressing a toast to the 
Chief Executive of this country, 
when he said, "I propose a toast to 
our honored guest with the spark- 
ling beverage sealed with the ap- 
proval of the Almighty," and that 
was water. Perhaps our friends 
thought that they could not put 
water on the table without being 
thought lacking in courtesy when 
entertaining their friends from 
abroad, but it seems to me that we 
ought to live up to every principle 
in our homes, and let people who 
visit us understand how we live and 
what we do there. It will go far- 
ther toward impressing them with 
our belief and our faith than any- 
thing else. 

Just now we in Colorado, of the 
Western States Mission, are in the 
centre of the fight being waged by 
a renegade member of one of the 
splendid and cherished families of 
this state, a fight that is intended 
to rid Colorado of the "Mormon 
Plague." Think of it ! Well, I see 
in it only good, for at the time when 
one of his greatest efforts thus far 
made during his campaign, in one 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 



91 



of the churches in Denver a few- 
weeks ago, a prominent citizen of 
this country, a man who has trav- 
eled world wide, stepped out on the 
street during a meeting one Sunday 
afternoon in Denver, with several 
hundred people assembled, and in- 
terrupted one of our speakers, say- 
ing, "Young man, permit me to say 
a few words. " He took his place 
with the elders and said to the peo- 
ple, "I want to say to you that I 
have traveled all over the world. 
I have also traveled largely in 
Utah and wherever there are 
'Mormons,' and I have done ap- 
proximately two million dollars 
worth of business with them and 
have yet to lose a dollar, and I 
want to say to you here today that 
they are an honest people and a 
good people. Futhermore, when it 
comes to morality, you will not find 
angels in heaven any purer than 
the women and girls who belong to 
the 'Mormon' Church." He con- 
tinued, "Utah ranks third in edu- 
cation in the United States. And 
who has accomplished that? Why 
the 'Mormon' people, because they 
have been in control of Utah for 
all these years. I was born and 
raised a Roman Catholic, but," said 
he, "I am going to raise my voice 
here and everywhere I go in be- 
half of that people." An acquain- 
tance of his, a traveling man whom 
he had not met for several years, 
stepped out after he had concluded 
his talk, and said, "I want to say 
amen to what has been said by my 
friend, for I have had large busi- 
ness interests in Utah for over 
twenty years and what he has said 
to you is true." Another man still, 
a stranger to both, took off his hat 
and remarked, "The words spoken 
here are true." 

Now, perhaps we may have a lit- 



tle agitation; I don't doubt it; but 
when we can have men who will, 
of their own accord, stand up on 
the street corners and defend us, I 
think we have nothing particularly 
to fear. 

My brothers and sisters, there 
may arise certain things in our 
lives which will bring to us the 
thought that good days are pre- 
paring . for us ; a raise in rents, a 
political victory; tlie return of a 
lost one ; a bringing back to life of 
a dear one who was afflicted; all 
may tend temporarily to bring us to 
believe that all is well. But after 
all, it depends on individual action. 
Ours is essentially an individual 
work and each one of us will have 
to answer for his or her actions, 
not only in a measure to our friends 
and neighbors, but to our God. 
Again, the words of Emerson, 
"Nothing can bring you peace but 
yourselves. Nothing can bring you 
peace but the triumph of princi- 
ples." We have the principles 
which will exalt and save us if we 
will rightly live them. Let us not 
fear the world. Let us admonish 
all to weigh well the principles that 
we teach and practice and see if 
they find therein anything objec- 
tionable. Let us look them straight 
in the face and say we claim the 
God given right in this free country 
to believe as we choose, "and allow 
all men the same privilege, let them 
worship how, when or what they 
may." 

May the blessings of heaven be 
with you, my dear friends and like- 
wise all Israel, that our principles 
may direct us aright, and that our 
examples may be such that they will 
attract the world; and that we may 
be saved in the kingdom of God, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE.

a tenor solo, entitled, "Fairest Lord, 
Jesus." 

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 

(President of Granite Stake.) 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, 
that the Spirit of the Lord may di- 
rect my utterance this afternoon. 
I have been interested in what has 
been said in all the sessions of the 
conference, and in the remarks of 
our mission presidents this after- 
noon. It brings to my mind the 
thought that the fruits of "Mor- 
monism" are good, particularly to 
those who are laboring in the min- 
istry, devoting their time to the 
work of the Lord. I have often 
remarked that no greater blessing" 
could come to a young man than to 
be called on a mission to proclaim 
the truth to the nations of the earth. 
If he does not do much good to oth- 
er people, at least he makes a man 
of himself, and returns full of dig- 
nity, grace and testimony of the 
work of the Lord. 

I was traveling in the southern 
part of the state a few years ago, 
with a man who was an atheist, a 
good man, but without faith in the 
work of the Lord. He formerly 
belonged to this Church, and had 
witnessed the grace and the good- 
ness of it; but he had fallen into 
darkness, and the light within him 
had become very dark indeed. We 
were traveling together on the same 
train, and with us was a young man 
who had just returned from a mis- 
sion, who was on the way to his lit- 
tle home settlement. We entered 
into conversation with him, and 
found him a splendid sample of 
youth and manhood, clean, and pure 



in his habits. It seemed like his 
whole soul was full of sunshine and 
good cheer. He reported to us his 
missionary experiences, his call, and 
how gladly he had accepted it, and 
yet with what fear he went into the 
world, fearful of his lack of knowl- 
edge of the world and of what 
would happen in his case ; but he 
had faith, and he went, believing in 
the Lord Jesus Christ, in the divin- 
ity of the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and that this is the 
work of the Lord. He bore that 
testimony with faith and courage, 
in the face of the opposition of the 
world. He told us of his ups and 
downs, of the doors that had been 
closed in his face, of many evil 
things that had been said about him 
and his companions, the work, and 
the people living in these valleys of 
the mountains. Further, he related 
some of the pleasures that he en- 
joyed in his ministry, when pro- 
claiming these things, and told of 
the witness he had of the Spirit of 
the Lord. In common with nearly 
all of our young men who have been 
out proclaiming this Gospel, he tes- 
tified that the most pleasant time 
in his life was out in his missionary 
field. My friend was much enter- 
tained in the remarks which this 
young man had to make. He had 
known of other young men return- 
ing from missions, and had wit- 
nessed similar development evi- 
denced in them. Quite a concourse 
of people was at the station to re- 
ceive this young man, and the tears 
of joy and happiness witnessed in 
his behalf, in that settlement, had 
quite an effect upon my friend. 
After the train went on, he turned 
to me and said : 

"I don't know what there is about 
this faith of yours that brings about 
this wonderful result. I have a bov 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



about the age of the young man 
who has just left us, and I would 
be glad to have him go out into the 
world as a missionary, if he could 
only come back with the same spirit, 
energy, life and beauty that this boy 
manifests on his return, because 
truly something wonderful has hap- 
pened in his life. If my boy could 
go without his having to accept 
your faith, and get the education 
that these your missionary boys re- 
ceive, I would rather have him do it 
than to have him take the same 
length of time in the best college 
in the land." Again he said, "I 
don't know what there is about your 
religion that brings this result, and 
yet I witness the result." 

I tried to explain to him what 
there is in it that brings this result ; 
but, of course, he would not accept 
my reasoning, because his darkness 
was so great, owing to lack of faith 
in this work. I knew him. He was 
a man of the world. I rejoiced 
that the fruits of this missionary 
work were so manifest. It is one 
example out of hundreds and thou- 
sands of others of our boys who 
go out to proclaim this everlasting 
Gospel. The world ought to appre- 
ciate this fact! but they cannot un- 
derstand why it is that the men who 
are more deeply interested in this 
work, who devote most of their 
time to it, should enjoy the spirit 
of their ministry and work. But 
the truth is manifest in the good 
life they lead, and the fruits of the 
ministry are good to behold. 

In the stake where I preside we 
have a great many young men who 
go out to proclaim the Gospel, and 
when they go away I notice the 
class of young men they are ; and 
when they return, I witness again 
the wonderful transformation that 
has come over them. They are in- 



telligent, clean, sweet, honorable 
young people, and a credit to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I would that all of us 
could be judged by the standard 
manifest in the return of the elder 
who has been out proclaiming this 
everlasting Gospel in the world. We 
need not be ashamed of them, or of 
their ministry, or of their work, be- 
cause they add glory to the cause of 
God in the earth. 

My father, in teaching me, was 
anxious, of course, that I should do 
honor and credit to my family name 
and do what is right and proper, 
and honorable, and straightforward 
in life. He desired me to occupy, 
possibly, some prominent place be- 
fore my fellow men; but the greatest 
end to which he felt that any of us 
could aspire was to be a consistent 
an honorable, and an upright Lat- 
ter-day Saint. In this achievement 
there is scope, he felt, for people to 
hold up their heads with credit be- 
fore all men. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, 
that this missionary labor in the 
world is a glorious experience for 
our young people. I have noted 
what a wonderful influence it has, 
not only upon him who goes away, 
but faith is increased in the house 1 
hold from which he goes. They 
look forward with wonderful pleas- 
ure to the letters they 'receive from 
their boy, and to the testimony 
which he bears, the experiences that 
he has in the world, and the bless- 
ings of the Lord that come unto 
him. A miracle happens in his own 
life, when he goes out to preach 
the Gospel; while faith is increased 
in the hearts of his father and moth- 
er, his brothers and his sisters, and 
they all rejoice in a testimony of 
this work. Only a few days ago, I 
had a man call on me. He is a 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



member of the Church. He' is a 
good man of the world, but he 
"doesn't do much" in the Church, 
though an honorable and a splen- 
did man. His boy was called on a 
mission, had faith enough to go and 
went, and the parents rejoiced as 
did every one of the household. 
There was purity, virtue, and the 
spirit of the Gospel with them, and 
they rejoiced that a young man 
from that household was worthy to 
go out and preach the Gospel. Ev- 
ery once in a while, this father 
comes to me with a letter that he 
receives from this boy, and he 
thinks that his son is one of the 
most wonderful men in the world, 
because he has a testimony of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and is living such a good life in the 
world. It brings joy and happiness 
to the Latter-day Saints to have 
young people go out and preach this 
Gospel. I feel that there ought to 
be a missionary spirit in the hearts 
of the people — that where fathers 
have boys who can go out and offer 
their services unto the Lord our 
God to teach His word unto the 
nations of the earth, they ought to 
rejoice. No father's hand or voice 
ought ever to be raised against the 
going forth of their sons, whenever 
they have an opportunity to go out 
and preach .this gospel, because 
there is no greater joy or happi- 
ness can come to your children than 
to have them obtain acknowledge 
that Jesus is the Christ, and that the 
work that we are engaged in is the 
work of the Lord, our God. We 
should strengthen this missionary 
spirit in our midst. 

I remember being in one of the 
cities of the United States, in a 
long, crowded thoroughfare, when 
I saw two boys hurrying along with 
the rest of the crowd, and I picked 



them out. I did not know why, 
particularly, but in looking at them, 
there was something different about 
them from the people surrounding, 
and I made up my mind that they 
were Latter-day Saint missionaries. 
I had never seen them before, but I 
walked up to them, introduced my- 
self, and asked them if they were 
from Utah, and lo and behold, the 
answer revealed that they were 
boys out proclaiming the Gospel. 
Something about these boys ap- 
pealed to me, and I believed in my 
soul that they were Latter-day 
Saints. The thing that impressed 
me was that there was a purity 
about them that was different. 
There was an ambition, a hope, and 
something written in their counten- 
ances that impressed me as being 
different from their surroundings. 
I rejoice that our boys have this 
purity, and that they can go out in- 
to the world conscious that they are 
clean, and sweet, and pure from the 
sins of the world. 

Now that is the boy who preaches 
the Gospel in the world ; it ought to 
be equally true of our boys and 
girls here at home. We ought to 
be examples to the whole world, in 
regard to these things, and this 
missionary spirit ought to be prev- 
alent here at home. Oh what hap- 
piness comes to the boy who goes 
out as a missionary to preach this 
gospel ! He will endure the rebuffs 
and the scoffs of the world bravely, 
to be a minister "of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, testifying of this work and 
the things the Lord has done for 
this people. I feel that we ought 
to exercise some of this missionary 
spirit at home. I believe that our 
home boys and girls should also 
enjoy the fruits that come to those 
who are engaged abroad in the 
work of the Lord, for there is am- 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



95 



pie field for them to act as mission- 
aries here at home. There is not a 
settlement in our land but what 
there is need to labor among the 
people and to teach the Gospel unto 
them. Right here at home we have 
abundance of material, and any 
number of men filled with the spirit 
of missionary work, and yet we 
have scores of people who belong to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and many other peo- 
ple who are not members of this 
Church, who would be glad of an 
opportunity to hear this Gospel and 
to whom they could preach. We 
could do much more of this work 
right here at home. I have often- 
times thought that there is room for 
wonderful improvement among our 
people in the matter of preaching 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ at home, 
particularly to those people who are 
weak in the faith, who do not com- 
prehend fully the glory and the 
goodness of this work. We ought 
to go out of our way to try to build 
them up, and bless them, and do 
good unto them. I wish that our 
missionaries, when they come home, 
could do a little more of this work 
among their companions who have 
not the same light and understand- 
ing that they, have — that they 
would go out among those who 
perhaps have made some mistakes 
in life, and who are not living up 
to what they should, and try to 
bring them back to a realization of 
the truth, and to activity and res- 
olution in their religious life and 
duties. I have sometimes used this 
expression to our people ; we go 
out into the world to preach the 
Gospel, and we have the doors 
slammed in our faces, many and 
many a time, and after awhile we 
get some of these people to accept 
our tracts. We labor with them as 



we ought to labor with them, and 
we spend time and means to bring 
them into the Church, and when we 
haze done that, we feel that we 
have done a wonderful work, and 
we have. We do not ask so much 
abcut these people, as to their life 
in -the past, as long as they will re- 
pent of their sins and renew them- 
selves in the waters of baptism that 
they may receive the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. Yet I feel that many 
missionaries come home and feel 
that their missionary work is ended, 
and there is no opportunity to labor 
further ; but I - say unto you that 
there are hundreds and thousands 
right here in the wards and stakes 
of Zion who need laboring with, 
and if our missionaries would exer- 
cise the same spirit of love and 
charity and kindness, with them as 
with people in the world, they 
would do a wonderful work. One 
of the difficulties about these mat- 
ters is this, that we are so apt to 
see mistakes in the people with 
whom we are familiar, so much so 
that we cannot see much virtue in 
them ; but I believe that if we would 
work with the Spirit of Christ, right 
among our own people here at 
home, that we might garner many 
precious souls into the work of the 
Lord. We are so apt to see the mis- 
takes of our neighbors that we can- 
not imagine there is any good in 
them, and we make up our minds 
that they have gone to the bad ; but 
seldom will one find any one who 
will not be susceptible to the influ- 
ence of some good spirit that may 
work with them. I have had many 
young men tell me that they have 
never been labored with in the spirit 
of kindness, and that their mistakes 
have been magnified ; what they 
need is some good man to put his 
arm around them and try to lead 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them back into a better way. I 
feel that in this work there is great 
room for the returned missionaries 
to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
to their neighbors. All of us who 
hold the Priesthood of the Lord 
Jesus Christ should exercise it for 
the building up of the kingdom of 
God, and the dissemination of His 
word. I want to tell you that if it 
were my boy who thus needed to 
be brought back into the right way, 
I would be thankful to the man who 
would go out of his way to exer- 
cise that kind of a spirit to build 
him up, and to make him feel anew 
the spirit of the Gospel. I believe 
there is no kind of work in Zion 
of more importance than that. We 
ought to exercise charity, and be 
willing to put forth our efforts for 
one another, and especially to such 
as are in need of an awakening. I 
feel that we ought to do this among 
the Latter-day Saints at home, and 
try to magnify the cause of Christ 
here, so that we may have more of 
these boys imbued with this spirit, 
and thus testify to all mankind that 
the fruits of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ are good. God bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNIOff. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I have listened with interest to 
the remarks of the brethren who 
have preceded me, and I trust that 
the few moments I stand here, I 
may enjoy the same spirit that di- 
rected their words. 

These brethren have alluded to 
the interest that some people are 
taking in our religion, who are not 
of our faith, and it reminded me of 
the remark of the Savior when He 
said, "And this gospel of the king- 



dom shall be preached in all the 
world for a witness unto all nations : 
and then shall the end come." There 
is no question but that honorable 
men and women of the earth will, 
sooner or later, according to their 
day and time, listen to the teach- 
ings of the elders of Israel, for the 
gospel they teach is the "gospel of 
the kingdom" that was preached by 
the Savior. It is destined to attract 
the attention of the world, and they 
will listen respectfully to the proc- 
lamation made by ' elders of the 
"Mormon" Church. 

The world understands -"Mor- 
monism" better today than ever be- 
fore. When men take a stand of 
opposition now, and criticize the 
acts of the "Mormon" people, it 
usually happens that their antag- 
onism makes friends for us. We 
need not be afraid, for the Lord 
Almighty is the author of what is 
called "Mormonism." He stands 
behind it because He revealed it 
unto the children of men through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it 
will resound through this earth, un- 
til every man and woman under 
heaven shall have a chance to re- 
ceive or reject this gospel of the 
Savior of the world. 

The Lord revealed unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith this princi- 
ple, that no man can be saved in 
ignorance, and that, before men 
should stand before the judgment 
bar of God, every man or woman, 
either in this world or after depart- 
ing, will have the privilege of un- 
derstanding the gospel of the Re- 
deemer, so that they may be able to 
accept or reject it. I listened to a 
sermon, delivered a short time ago 
by a noted divine of the Presby- 
terian church. He took for his sub- 
ject the "Country Church." He 
stated that in company with some 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BEN N ION. 



97 



companions in the ministry, he had 
been holding a conference, and in 
that conference the subject of the 
country church was considered, and 
they deliberated upon the best meth- 
ods to reach the people in the coun- 
try. He said they were sadly neg- 
lected. They are a fine class of peo- 
ple, men and women who are pro- 
ducers, able to pay their debts and 
to support a minister, and who 
would do so if they had the chance. 
But he criticised their ministers 
this way : he said they preferred to 
live in the cities. When a certain 
district in the country wanted to 
have religious services, they sent to 
the city for one of the ministers to 
come clown there and hold service 
with them on the selected Sunday. 
He said that a woman living in the 
country might just as well send to 
town for a dress, or a man living 
in the country might just as well 
send for a suit of clothes already 
made up, and take chances on the 
fit. He said the ministers in the 
church must mingle with the peo- 
ple, labor with them, live with 
them, and thus create an interest 
among them. He declared that the 
Church in the world that is growing 
fastest is the "Mormon" Church, 
there is 'no church that equals it. He 
further said, they had preachers 
generally that appealed to men, and 
that their missionaries visited the 
country districts frequently, and 
their churches were filled wherever 
they went. 

My brethren and sisters, I cite 
you this for the reason, it is evi- 
dence that the world is taking no- 
tice of "Mormonism," and taking 
notice of the labors of the Elders 
of Israel out in the world, and the 
growth of the "Mormon" people. 
This gentleman did not understand 
that the Elders have within their 



hearts and within their minds a 
knowledge that God lives and that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that "Mor- 
monism" is the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer by which man may be saved 
in the presence of Almighty God. 
Moses, in speaking to ancient Is- 
rael, said, "The secret things be- 
long unto the Lord, our God; but 
those things which are revealed be- 
long unto us and to our children 
for ever, that we may do all the 
words of this law." The Lord reveal- 
ed unto the Prophet Joseph Smith 
the true condition of affairs as they 
existed in the religious World. He 
told him that he should not join 
any of the denominations extant at 
that time, that they had a form of 
godliness but they denied the power 
thereof, that while they honored 
God with their lips their hearts were 
far from Him. Joseph Smith was 
God's authorized agent in restor- 
ing the gospel to mankind. When 
we go out into the world, and 
preach in the country churches that 
have been neglected by the ministers 
of the world, we gather the honest 
hearted men and women everywhere 
that the gospel message reaches. The 
Savior said, "My sheep hear my 
voice, and a stranger they will not 
follow, and they come unto .me." 
So when the Elders go into country 
districts, and upon the streets of 
cities, and wherever they may have 
the opportunit) r to preach, men and 
women of the character named by 
the Savior thus hear His message, 
and a stranger they will not follow. 
It is not to be wondered at that peo- 
ple of the world are "beginning to 
take notice of "Mormonism." We 
aie making friends in every land 
and clime in this world today; we 
are becoming better known. 

I had a conversation a short time 
ago with a gentleman who lives in 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Pueblo, Colorado, in President Her- 
rick's mission field. He is president 
of one of the great banks in that 
country. In speaking of the apos- 
tate to whom Brother Herrick re- 
ferred, he said, "We know the Mor- 
mon people, and we know that 
writer wants to organize us into 
some kind of a club to fight you peo- 
ple, but," said he, "we know the 
Mormon people too well ; and he re- 
ceived no encouragement there." I 
say to our brethren, we need not be 
afraid to go on missions, if we live 
our religion. When men are called 
to go into the nations of the earth 
to 1 preach the gospel they should 
cheerfully respond. The Lord will 
open up the way for them to go 
into the world, and successfully pro- 
claim the message that the Father 
and the Son delivered to the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. They can fearless- 
ly declare that God lives, that He 
has a body, that He is able to speak ; 
to see ; to hear ; to walk arid talk ; 
that He is in very deed the true and 
living God. There are people in this 
world who profess Christianity, 
thousands of them, who are teach- 
ing today that God has not a body, 
that He is a spirit without body, 
parts or passions. The Lord has 
revealed the truth about Himself 
unto ancient and latter-day Israel. 
This important truth has been given 
unto us as a weapon to overcome 
the error which the adversary has 
disseminated, and gives every one a 
chance to use the free agency that 
God has given unto His children. 

I am sure that there are many 
people in the world who love the 
truth. There is faith in the earth, 
and since the davs of the Prophet 
Toseph Smith faith has increased. 
In support of this statement I will 
relate an incident that happened a 



short time ago. A certain jury that 
had been sitting in a case, and were 
to decide whether a man was to> be 
hanged or not, before they rendered 
their decision, they went into their 
room and there those twelve men 
knelt down and prayed unto the 
Father that they might render a 
true and a just decision. I say that 
I believe faith is increasing in the 
world, and that many men and 
women will yet join the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
because of that faith. They will 
go down into the waters of baptism 
as soon as they are converted. The 
duty of preaching the gospel unto 
the children of men is ours as long 
as the Lord permits us to live on 
the earth, and remain faithful unto 
Him. 

The statement recorded by Moses 
in the twenty-ninth chapter and 
twenty-ninth verse of Deuteronomy 
is correct. We know that it is 
wrong for us to use intoxicating 
drinks ; it is wrong for us to de- 
fraud ; or to commit sin of any kind. 
If we observe that which the Lord 
has revealed unto us, we will not err, 
we will respond better to the will of 
the Master. The Lord has sent His 
servants in the earth ; it is just the 
same as though He had Himself 
laid hands upon the heads of those 
who preside in this Church. When 
the Lord called Edward Partridge 
into the ministry as a bishop in the 
Church, He said* (36th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants) : "I 
will lay my hand upon your head 
by my servant Sidney Rigdon." 
There was an ensample. This 
work that the Lord revealed unto 
the Prophet Joseph Smith will 
stand, and the principles thereof are 
given to aid in accomplishing His 
work. The men and the women who 



ELDER WILLIAM T. IACK. 



99 



go forth and preach the principles 
of the gospel, at home or abroad, 
are assisting the Lord. We have a 
work to perform for the Lord each 
day. 

It ought never to be said of any 
man in the Church, that he ever 
raised his voice against the bishop, 
or against any of the presiding of- 
ficers of the Church. In the days 
when Israel demanded a king, and 
said: "We want to be like these 
other people who live in the land ; 
we want a king, we demand of you 
a king," the Prophet Samuel was 
troubled, and he knelt down and 
prayed unto the Lord and asked 
what he should do. And the Lord 
said unto him : "They have not re- 
jected thee, but they have rejected 
me, that I should not reign over 
them." The Lord has revealed 
many things unto us. We hear them 
in our homes, in our conferences, 
in our Sabbath day meetings and 
elsewhere, and we ought to be fa- 
miliar with them. The Lord has 
given unto us much knowledge, and 
therein is power that we might be 
able to withstand the attacks of the 
adversary, though those attacks be 
as numerous as the microbes that 
liave been alluded to by other 
speakers. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
us, latter-day Israel, that we may 
have faith to overcome our weak- 
nesses, and that we may be true 
men at home or abroad, and live as 
the Lord requires us, that no man 
nor set of men may justly condemn 
us. The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Master, the tempest is raging! 

The billows are tossing high ! 
The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness, 

No shelter or help is nigh. 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 

(President of Cassia Stake.) 

Truly "the song of the righteous 
is a prayer unto the Lord." I feel 
that we have been highly favored 
this afternoon in our services in 
this hall, in listening to the sweet 
singing and music that has been 
furnished by the Murray choir; in- 
deed, the singing that has been fur- 
nished during the former sessions 
of this conference in the great Tab- 
ernacle; as well as here, has been an 
inspiration to all those who have at- 
tended. 

I have rejoiced very much, my 
brethren and sisters, in the priv- 
ilege that I have of attending this 
conference, listening to the testi- 
monies and the instructions that we 
have received from the brethren. I 
rejoice very much in the testimony 
that we listened to at the morning 
session of this conference, by Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith, the man who 
is the mouthpiece of the Lord unto 
us at the present time. I rejoiced 
in the testimony that he bore con- 
cerning himself. I have watched 
his life for more than fifty years, 
and he voiced my sentiments when 
he mentioned that period of his own 
life. I have looked upon him all 
my life as being a model of purity, 
as being the most absolutely just 
man that I have ever known. I 
have admired him for his sterling 
integrity, his great strength of char- 
acter, his inspired mind, and for his 
ability to get, I believe, nearer to 
the Lord than any man I have been 
privileged to know in my life. I 
hope that those who comprise the 
membership of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints appre- 
ciate this man as does your humble 
servant, that we appreciate all our 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



brethren who stand as leaders in 
Israel, and that we show our ap- 
preciation of them by acting upon 
and carrying out their precepts, and 
following their splendid example. 

I rejoice very much in the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. My heart 
has been made glad this afternoon, 
in listening to the stirring remarks 
of the previous speakers, brethren 
who are in the midst of the battle 
in this great work, mission presi- 
dents who are laboring in the field 
in the forefront of the fight for 
righteousness. It is safe for us to 
listen to their testimonies and to 
accept their counsels, because they 
are men of God, laboring for the 
gospel of righteousness, and they 
enjoy the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty. The gospel will bless us at 
home, the same as it has done for 
many of us in the mission field, if 
we will only apply ourselves in the 
same diligent manner. The reason 
why some of us do not feel as good, 
perhaps, as those who have been out 
in' the mission field as messengers 
of salvation, is due to the fact that 
we are not as active at home as we 
were when we were abroad. If 
Ave will continue missionary work, 
take upon ourselves the duties and 
responsibilities of disseminating the 
gospel at home, we will enjoy the 
missionary spirit in our lives, and 
the Lord will bless us and inspire 
our minds, will strengthen our 
memories, and cause us to expand 
in our intellect and feelings, and 
increase in wisdom, and in under- 
standing of His divine will and pur- 
poses, so that we will not be at a 
stand-still at home, as, I am sorry 
to sav, some of our brethren are 
who have returned from active mis- 
sionary life. 

We have heard this afternoon of 
the field there is for missionary 



work here at home. How true that 
is, and yet some of our brethren 
who were active in the world fail 
to appreciate this fact, and are not 
as active at home as they might be. 
I remember a young man to whom 
I listened as he bore his testimony 
after returning, and in one of his 
remarks he said he was thankful 
that his preaching days were over. 
I wonder if there are many who feel 
the same way after returning home, 
thankful that their missionary days 
are over? It has been said by one 
of old that the "race is not to the 
swift nor the battle to the strong, 
but to him that endureth faithful to 
the end." We may run swiftly, and 
do an exceptionally splendid work 
for two or more years, as our mis- 
sionaries do ; but if, when we come 
home, we forget the Lord, fall back 
into the ways of the world, and 
give way to weaknesses that some 
are addicted to before they go into 
the missionary field, we will not 
enjoy the Spirit of the Lord at 
home. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that it is our duty, as Latter-day 
Saints, that we should kneel down 
in our homes morning and night, 
and pray to the Lord to prosper His 
work upon the earth. I thought to- 
day while sitting here that, in a 
sense, the Lord cannot prosper this 
work unless we will take hold of the 
duties and responsibilities that rest 
upon us as consistent members of 
the Church, as faithful men and 
women. This Church cannot be 
better than its membership. When 
speaking with men in the world 
that say the "Mormon" people are 
all right, that they find no fault 
with the rank and file of the "Mor- 
mon" Church, but complain against 
leading authorities of the Church, I 
feel in my soul to wish that all the 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 



101 



members of this Church were 
nearer to coming up to the standard 
of those men who stand at the head 
of the quorums of the priesthood. 
There is plenty of room, it seems 
to me, my brethren and sisters, for 
us to make an improvement in our 
lives as members of the Church. 
There is a great responsibility rest- 
ing upon every one of us. It seems 
to me there is no other church in the 
world that has to meet the responsi- 
bility of the action of the humblest 
member of that church to the extent 
that is true of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. When 
there is one member of our Church, 
in the communities in which we live, 
that goes astray, or brings upon 
himself reproach, he does not suffer 
the contumely alone, but the stigma 
is cast upon all members of the 
Church who reside in that locality, 
and some even blame- the whole 
membership of the "Mormon" 
Church, and claim that it is the 
fruits of "Mormonism." While this 
is not a proper view to take, it is 
the view that many in the' world 
take, and I presume that, to some 
extent, they are justified in that 
view, because we hold up a higher 
standard than does any other re- 
ligious organization in the world. 

We claim that our Church has 
been organized by divine direction, 
that the Lord Himself has been 
instrumental in bringing forth this 
work, that is known in the world as 
"Mormonism," and that He has re- 
vealed the glorious principles of 
truth that we have accepted as our 
rule of faith and our guide. We 
claim that we are constantly re- 
ceiving revelations from the Al- 
mighty, that we are guided day by 
day by those revelations, and that 
we have in our midst prophets, 
apostles, and inspired men. Now, 



you can see readily how much bet- 
ter we ought to be than the people 
of the world • it is quite natural for 
them to look for more from us than 
from people who are not able to 
make such professions. It would be 
a victory for the adversary if he 
could induce the Latter-day Saints 
to forget their high calling, and 
come down to the standard of their 
fellow men in the world ; the enemy 
of righteousness would then have 
accomplished his purpose. It is his 
design to impede the progress of 
this work. He cannot do it, as far 
as the majority of this people are 
concerned. I feel sure it is impos- 
sible for him to overcome the high 
authorities of the "Mormon" 
Church, because of the purity of 
their lives and the devotion that 
they manifest to this work of the 
Almighty. I believe it is not pos- 
sible for the adversary to come into 
this congregation, nor any other 
congregation of the Latter-day 
Saints, and successfully combat this 
work. That is not his plan of oper- 
ation ; his plan is to influence the 
individual members of the Church, 
some of us with discontent, some 
with fault finding, some with a fail- 
ure to pay tithing, some with neg- 
lect of one duty and some with an- 
other, until we lose the spirit of the 
work and forget our high calling 
and destiny. 

Now I feel that, as members of 
the Church of Christ, we ought to 
examine ourselves, each one of us, 
and find out where we and our 
families stand, see that our boys 
and girls are being taught in the 
fear and nurture of the Lord, and 
that they are being preserved from 
those evils that are extant in this 
age of the world. I believe with 
all my heart that we are living in 
the hour of God's judgments, "and 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that the adversary is spreading be- 
fore our young people those tempta- 
tions that, if he succeeds, will lead 
them away from Christ and from 
His work. I feel that we cannot 
be too careful, circumspect, and 
conscientious before our families, to 
preserve our integrity and fidelity, 
and make every possible effort that 
our children may grow up around 
our firesides, free from allurements 
and infatuation that would cause 
them to fall. They should be made 
to feel in their souls that their father 
and mother are honest, and that 
there must be something in this 
work, something that has induced 
them to willingly make sacrifices, 
and that they do make them cheer- 
fully for the gospel's sake. 

I pray that the Lord will bless 
us,, that the spirit of this conference 
may be taken to our homes and may 
sink into our hearts, and that we 
may realize the great obligations 
that rest upon us as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. I trust that we will 
constitute ourselves missionaries at 
home, first with our own households 
and then with the families of those 
that are around us, our friends and 
associates. We find, in the stake in 
which I have the pleasure to live, 
that there are thousands of good, 
honest men and women coming in 
from the eastern states, and from 
other parts of the country, casting 
their lots with us in the. new lands 
that are being opened up for homes, 
and I find that there is the best 
field for missionary work, perhaps 
as great as can be found anywhere 
in the world. 

We have a great many men in 
the Church who have the spirit of 
the gospel with them, but they are 
never prepared, financially, to go 
out into the world and preach the 



gospel. ■ They are willing to go if 
they had the means, but they never 
get the means to enable them to re- 
spond to a call to go abroad. Now 
we are going to get around this 
fall, up in Cassia stake of Zion, and 
we are going to call a hundred or 
more of just such men, and give 
them a mission in that stake, give 
them some books and tracts, and 
send them forth among the people 
to preach the gospel. In this man- 
ner, I believe the people will be 
benefited, and our brethren who en- 
gage in that work will be benefited, 
and good results will come to the 
great work that we are engaged in. 

I rejoice in the testimony of 
Jesus. I know that the gospel is 
true, and I know that it will save 
all those who shall endure faithful 
unto the end. I hope that we will 
remember the duties and responsi- 
bilities that rest upon us, and that 
we will do our full duty as members 
of the Church of Christ, which I 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Admonition to sustain the Church au- 
thorities,' and do the will of God. 

We will now present the general 
authorities of the Church, and we 
desire that each one of you here will 
vote as you feel that you ought to 
vote. In voting for the general au- 
thorities of the Church, we exer- 
cise the individual privilege that we 
have to sustain them, and, if we 
think there is any good reason why 
they should not be sustained, it is 
our privilege to vote against them. 

I feel to say to the Latter-day 
Saints today that, as far as I am 
concerned, this conference has been 
profitable to rhe, and I hope that we 
may all go home with this feeling. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



103 



I believe it will be profitable for us 
to examine ourselves and see where- 
in we may make improvement in 
our lives, that we may continue to 
enjoy the blessings of the Lord, and 
that we may indeed increase within 
us the measure of power of the 
Spirit of God. You may fall, and I 
may fall by the wayside, but, as sure 
as the sun shines, this is the work 
of Jehovah, and He will communi- 
cate a knowledge of it, by the power 
of His Spirit, to the hearts of the 
children of men. 

Let us obey those who are in au- 
thority over us, and sustain them 
not alone by word of mouth, but by 
acts and efforts ; through this obedi- 
ence we may know every moment 
that Jesus is the Redeemer of the 
world, and that there is placed with- 
in our reach His gospel for the up- 
lift and salvation of the human fam- 
ily. 

Let each one of us who are here 
today examine ourselves, find 
wherein we are short of what our 
Father in heaven would have us be, 
repent of our sins and turn unto Him 
with full purpose of heart. I prom- 
ise you, in the name of the Lord, 
if we will do this that this confer- 
ence will have been productive of 
good for us as long as we remain 
upon the earth. 

May the Lord add His blessing. 
May peace, joy and comfort be in 
,the hearts of the Latter-day Saints. 
May the gospel of our Lord find its 
way into the hearts of the children 
of men, that they may be touched 
by its purity, and by the evident di- 
vinity of the work that the Lord has 
established for their salvation, that 
they may understand the desire of 
our Father, and may be saved. May 
we put our shoulder to the wheel, 
each and all of us, and help to carry 
this work to a successful fruition, 



that in the end of our lives there 
may come unto all of us that wel- 
come plaudit, "Well done, thou 
faithful servant." This is my 
prayer in the.name of Jesus Christ.. 
Amen. 

Elder Bryant S. Hinckley pre- 
sented the names of the General 
Authorities of the Church, and offi- 
cers of General Boards of auxiliary 
organizations, and they were sev- 
erally sustained in the positions 
named, by unanimous vote of the 
congregation. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Damascus." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Mark Austin. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

Thousands of people gathered on 
the Temple grounds, unable to ob- 
tain admission to the Tabernacle or 
Assembly Hall, and an outdoor 
meeting was held for their benefit, 
at 2 p. m., near the Bureau of In- 
formation building. The services 
were presided over by Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. Music was fur- 
nished by Prof. Wm. C. Clive's or- 
chestra, and Elder Evan Arthur led 
the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. 
H. Smart. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"America." 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDES, BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

4 

(Of Bureau of Information.) 

My brethren, sisters and friends, 
we all rejoice and thank God for the 
privilege of meeting in General 
Conference, and we cannot fail to 
notice, from the increased attend- 
ance at each succeeding conference, 
that "Zion is growing." For many 
years past, it has been impossible to 
accommodate the visitors in the 
buildings on Temple block during 
the sessions, and when the weather 
is as auspicious as on this occasion, 
the large crowd assembled on the 
outside cannot all hear the speakers 
in an open-air meeting. 

We are glad to greet you in this 
meeting, and regret that we cannot 
provide seats for all present. We 
observe that in the congregation we 
have representatives from many 
countries, and from the islands of 
the sea. Elders who nave labored 
in New Zealand will remember how 
patiently the Saints in that far-off 
land would remain at such meetings 
as these, seated upon the ground 
or standing for eight and nine hours 
at a time. 

However, we do not intend to 
weary you at this session, but we 
trust that all who have come to wor- 
ship may be blessed in this gather- 
ing. I commend unto you again 
the thought that "Zion is growing." 
It now appears that the time will 
come when the Temple block will 
not hold the assembled Saints at con- 
ference time. Our buildings are al- 
ready too small, and the words of 
our hymn are applicable to this fea- 
ture of our work, as well as to the 
spreading of the Saints into the dif- 
ferent localities where they dwell. 

We often sing 



Give us room that we may dwell, 

Zion's children cry aloud ; 
See their numbers how they swell ! 

How they gather like a cloud ! 

Zion, now arise and shine ! 

Lo, thy light from heaven is come ! 
These that crowd from far are thine ; 

Give thy sons and daughters room. 

We feel that God will respond to 
this plea, for the Spirit that has 
caused Israel to gather together has 
emanated from Him. 

May the blessings invoked upon 
this congregation by President 
Smart be realized. May our hearts 
indeed be receptive, and may our 
souls be blessed by the truths that 
may be given unto us. 

The brethren who will speak, 
come before you in all humility, and 
with no other desire than to serve 
God, and respond to the call made 
of them. It depends largely upon 
us how much blessing we receive 
from the Lord at this meeting. We 
rely upon the promise "Blessed are 
they who hunger and thirst after 
righteousness, for they shall be 
filled." May the Spirit of the Lord 
satisfy the cravings of our hearts, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I sin- 
cerely desire an interest in your 
faith and prayers, and in your sym- 
pathy, that I may be able to say 
something upon this occasion that 
will be beneficial. 

• In the little experience that I 
have had in the preaching of the 
gospel in the world, I have learned 
this one lesson better than any other, 
that man of his own strength is not 
capable to teach his fellowman the 
things of God.

I rejoice in this privilege, and it 
is to me indeed a pleasure to see 
so many of my brethren and sisters 
congregated together on this spot 
to partake of the good spirit that has 
been poured out upon the people 
during our conference. I am 
thankful for the gospel, and I am 
thankful that I am a partaker of its 
blessings ; and that I have been 
counted worthy to spread the gospel 
message in the world. 

We read in the Scriptures that 
John saw that in the last day an 
angel should fly through the midst 
of heaven, having the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto those who 
dwell upon the earth, to every peo- 
ple, every nation, every kindred and 
every tongue. We also find that the 
Savior commissioned His apostles, 
after His resurrection, to take this 
same message and preach it unto 
every creature, saying that those 
who obeyed it, those who put it into 
practice, should be saved. It has 
been my privilege to be engaged in 
this work during the past five years, 
and it does me good to know that 
the gospel is being preached 
throughout the world, and that 
thousands are receiving its mes- 
sage. I know, with Paul, that it- is 
the power of God unto salvation, 
and I know that it is the only plan 
by which man can be redeemed. 

The Scriptures that I have cited 
teaches that the gospel is not alone 
unto one people, not alone unto 
those who are in a state of enlight- 
ened civilization. The gospel is un- 
to every creature, and it is for the 
purpose of saving all mankind and 
bringing them to a knowledge of 
the truth, and saving them in the 
presence of our Father in heaven. It 
is for the purpose of teaching man- 
kind faith in God, that true God 
whom to know is life eternal. It 



is for the teaching of mankind that 
they cannot be saved in His pres- 
ence in their sins. If men are 
wicked, they must repent, or they 
cannot be brought into that state 
of salvation that is prepared for 
those only who will accept the 
truth. It is a mistaken idea to be- 
lieve that men can be saved in the 
highest degree of glory in any man- 
ner of sin. Men must be pure, 

I rejoiced in the remarks of our 
beloved Apostle McKay yesterday, 
when he taught so faithfully the 
duties of those who receive the gos- 
pel. I tell you, my brethren and 
sisters, that if there are men in this 
congregation who are addicted to 
the habit of drinking, before they 
can be saved in the presence of our 
Father in heaven, they must repent 
of that evil ; and I say the same to 
any who. may be guilty of taking 
advantage of their brethren. They 
must repent or they cannot be 
saved. And I say the same to young 
people who, perchance, are addicted 
to any evils that exist in the world 
today, they must become clean. 
They must emulate the great ex- 
ample that was set us by our 
Savior, and be free, and clean, and 
pure from everything that is evil. 
Men may say that it is impossible for 
us to attain this in mortal life. I had 
the privilege of traveling with a 
learned Greek in Mexico, away 
down near the Isthmus of Tehaunta- 
peck, and I had an opportunity to 
explain to him some of the prin- 
ciples of our gospel. He is a man 
that speaks about ten different lan- 
guages, and has traveled this globe 
over, and he says that he has in- 
vestigated most creeds, and he be- 
lieves it utterly impossible for men 
in this mortal sphere to attain to 
that condition of perfection. u He 
was particularly emphatic in the 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



statement that he believed that the 
people among whom I am called to 
labor, the Mexicans, the Lamanites, 
descendants of Father Lehi, who 
reside on this continent, are incap- 
able in their nature of receiving 
and putting into practice these prin- 
ciples. But, I testify to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that the gospel 
is for the salvation of every man 
who will avail himself of it, and it 
makes no difference unto the Lord 
the color of a man's skin, or the 
nation to which he belongs. When 
the gospel message is presented to 
him if he will accept it, he has the 
power to cast out of himself every 
evil that he may have inherited, or 
that he may have acquired, and 
though his sins be as scarlet, he 
can • be washed pure and white as 
wool by the blood of our Savior, 
through obedience to the principles 
of the gospel. I testify to you, be- 
cause I know whereof I speak, that 
although the people among whom I 
labor have been brought low, in the 
providences of the Lord, and have 
been in the dregs of degradation, 
'sin and crime, I have seen them 
washed clean, and made pure, and 
many of them are today the equals 
of any men and women that live 
on the earth in purity, and in good- 
ness of life. There is no other 
power under the sun that could 
have done this for them except the 
gospel of our Savior, and His re- 
deeming grace. 

It is a grand mission, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to carry this mes- 
sage into the world, and I have re- 
ceived more joy, more satisfaction, 
and more consolation in my labors 
among those who know not the 
truth, than I have in any other duty, 
or privilege, or pleasure that I have 
enjoyed in my life. I say to the 
young and the middle-aged, and the 



able-bodied, that there are mil- 
lions yet who have not heard the 
gospel, millions who are seeking for 
the truth, millions who are in error 
. because they do not know any bet- 
ter, and what a blessed privilege it 
is to carry the truth that we have 
received, and redeem those who are 
in such a condition ! Woe unto us, 
I say, woe unto me if I do not 
preach the gospel, for freely I have 
received, and it should be our de- 
sire, and it is our duty to give free- 
ly. Not only preach it in the world, 
but live a consistent, a clean, and 
a pure life at home or abroad, that 
those who are not of us may see our 
good works, and be led to glorify 
our Father in heaven because of 
them. 

My brethren and sisters, I love 
this work. I am glad to have this 
privilege of speaking to you today 
and bearing my testimony that I 
know that the gospel is true, that I 
know it will never be taken from 
this world again until this world is 
redeemed. My prayer is that the 
blessings of the Lord may be 
poured out upon this people, that 
they may continue to grow in num- 
bers and in good works, and that 
the gospel may continue to be car- 
ried unto all the world until the 
prophecy of the Savior is fulfilled, 
when He said that this gospel of 
the kingdom should be preached in 
all the world as a witness before the 
end should come, a witness that men 
have the privilege of accepting the 
gospel, which is the power of God 
unto salvation, and that none may 
present themselves before our 
Father in heaven on the grand judg- 
ment day and be able to say, "Lord, 
I had not the privilege in my mor- 
tal life of hearing those principles." 

May God grant that we may have 
the spirit of this work upon us. 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY.

Particularly I appeal to the young 
men. Pray for it, my brethren, the 
desire to carry the gospel unto the 
world ; pray for the privilege. Avail 
yourselves of every opportunity to 
acquire knowledge, and the Lord 
will prepare you and will grant you 
this grand favor ; and He will fill 
your hearts with joy such as you 
have not yet felt, if you do so. May 
this be our happy lot ; and may the 
Lord bless you all, I ask in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 

(Of the Presidency of Wayne Stake.) 

I rejoice exceedingly in the spirit 
that has been manifest in the proc- 
lamation of the gospel by the ser- 
vants of the Lord during this con- 
ference. As we meet this afternoon, 
in this overflow meeting of the con- 
ference, under the canopy of heav- 
en, and shadowed by the temple of 
the living God, I am reminded of 
the prophetic words of Isaiah when 
he said that, "it shall come to pass 
in the last days the mountain of the 
house of the Lord shall be estab- 
lished in the tops of the mountains, 
and. shall be exalted above the hills, 
and all nations shall flow unto it, 
and many shall say, Come let us go 
up to the Mountain of the Lord, 
to the house of the God of Jacob, 
where we will learn of His ways and 
walk in His paths, for the law shall 
go forth of Zion and the word of 
the Lord from Jerusalem." The 
object of our Heavenly Father in 
gathering together His people from 
the various nations of the earth has 
been to teach them in His ways. It 
is true that in the nations where 
they were born, there is opportuni- 
ty, for a few of them at least, to 
learn something of the ways of the 
Lord. 



I am reminded of the remarks of 
Elder Goddard at the commence- 
ment of this meeting, that there are 
gathered here people from many na- 
tions, and we are a few out of the 
many that heard the glad tidings of 
great joy that were proclaimed in 
our fatherland. The question has 
occurred to me, while sitting here 
this afternoon, whether the Latter- 
day Saints, generally, who have 
gathered up to Zion, are as faithful, 
earnest and devoted in the perform- 
ance of their religious duties as 
when they received the light and the 
truth in the old countries? In the 
prophecy that I have quoted, we are 
reminded by Isaiah that the object 
of gathering was that the people 
should be taught in the ways of the 
Lord. In order that we may be 
properly taught, it is necessary to 
have authorized teachers; and this 
leads me to the thought that no 
man, as stated by Elder Pratt, is 
competent, of his own wisdom, of 
his own understanding and learn- 
ing, to declare the things of God. 
In contemplating the remarks of 
Elder McKay yesterday, with re- 
gard to the Latter-day Saints being 
a peculiar people, I am reminded 
that we are peculiar in this partic- 
ular, that, unlike all other "ortho- 
dox" Christians, we- believe that 
men must be called of God to 
preach the gospel and officiate in 
the ordinances thereof. It was de-. 
clared by the Apostle of old, "How 
shall they hear without a preacher, 
and how shall he preach except he 
be sent?" I draw your attention to 
the fact that the Son of God, the 
Redeemer of the world, came not 
unto mankind claiming any author- 
ity of Himself, save that which was 
given to Him of His Father. He 
proclaimed, "My doctrine is not 
mine, but His that sent me, and if 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



any man will do the will of the 
Father, he shall know of the doc- 
trine whether it be of God or 
whether I speak of Myself." Surely, 
if any living being had a right to 
claim authority for himself, it was 
the One who purchased the world 
by the shedding of His own blood ; 
but He recognized that eternal prin- 
ciple of authority. He knew be- 
cause He was present in the granu 
councils of heaven before thisearth 
was created, when the plan of salva- 
tion was formulated. He under- 
stood that He had been chosen of 
the Father, and that council, to be 
the Redeemer of the world. He 
glorified in the privilege of coming 
to earth to perform His mission, but 
He gave the glory, thanksgiving, 
and credit unto God the Father, 
whose will He had come to do. 

The Apostles did not call them- 
selves to the ministry. They did 
not assume to preach the gospel to 
the children of Judea before they 
were called. No, they were attend- 
ing to their duties, their labors and 
various avocations of life when the 
Savior went to the sea shore, and 
while some of them had their nets 
in the sea, in the very act of catch- 
ing fish, the Son of God called them 
to be fishers of men, and thus He 
selected them from that and other 
avocations of life. He told them 
that they had not chosen themselves 
to be ministers of the gospel, but 
He had called them, and "as the 
Father has sent me, even so, send 
I you." He gave them the commis- 
sion to go abroad and preach the 
gospel ; and, being called by the 
proper authority and power, we find 
that wherever they went signs fol- 
lowed their ministry, and the seal 
of heaven was put upon their labors. 
After the ministry of the Savior had 
closed, after He had made the great 



atonement and sacrifice, and after 
His resurrection, when all power 
was given unto Him in heaven and 
in earth, and He came to reason, 
counsel, and advise with His dis- 
ciples, and to teach them concern- 
ing the future, in His last instruc- 
tions He commanded them to go 
into all the world and preach the 
gospel to' every creature, saying, 
they that believed on Him, and were 
baptized with the baptism that He 
had instituted, should be saved, and 
they who believed not should be 
damned. Hence, we see that the 
Apostles of Jesus Christ were called 
by divine authority. They received 
their commission before His death 
and resurrection, and later, at His 
last appearance, He gave them 
power and authority to go into all 
the world. 

I have not the disposition to refer 
to the subject of the apostasy that 
followed the ministry of the first 
apostles of Jesus Christ, but I de- 
sire to draw the attention of the 
Latter-day Saints, and my friends 
who may not be of us who are pres- 
ent here this afternoon, that through 
all the ages of darkness, and the 
ages of reformation, since the ad- 
vent of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
the Apostles, until the coming of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, no man 
assumed to say that he had received 
a visitation from God. No man as- 
sumed to say that he had been di- 
rectly sent of God to preach the gos- 
pel, as Jesus proclaimed He was 
sent, as the apostles proclaimed they 
were sent, or as any of the other 
prophets anciently declared they re- 
ceived their commission of God. 
True it is that there have been many 
good and noble ones, men who have 
devoted their lives, men who have 
sacrificed their time and all they 
possessed for the progress of the 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 



109 



truths that they believed in. I think 
of the early reformers, of Luther, 
Knox, Calvin, Wesley and all the 
army of noble men whom God 
raised up to prepare the way for 
the coming of greater and better 
things, paving the way, so to speak, 
through those dark ages, that con- 
ditions might be favorable for the 
restoration of His Gospel and Holy 
Priesthood, and yet these men did 
not assume, as I say, to have been 
called of God. 

I think of the words of Charles 
Wesley, who was led, in thinking of 
the apostolic dispensation, to utter 
these words, a sentiment of his 
brother John and of the early re- 
formers : 

"O, what an age of golden days, 
0, what a choice, peculiar race, 
Washed in the Lamb's atoning blood, 
Anointed kings and priests to God." • 

What a glorious vision he had of 
that early dispensation of gospel 
gifts, and privileges and blessings. 
And then looking around in the 
world about him, summing up the 
faith of all the various religious 
sects, he says, 

"Where shall I wander now to find 
Successors they have left behind? 
The faithful, whom we seek in vain, 
Are 'minished from the sons of men." 

And then, in an exhortation to the 
Christians of that age, he says, 

"Ye differing sects who all declare 
'Lo, here is Christ,' or 'Christ is there,' 
Your stronger proofs divinely give 
And show me where true Christians 
live." 

Yes, if Charles Wesley had lived 
in these days, we might have 
thought he was a Latter-day Saint. 



At heart, he was a saint of God, but 
the fulness of light and truth had 
not then come, though these re- 
formers had a glimpse of it. They 
had their place in the great work of 
human redemption, and God will re- 
member them, as He will remember 
every soul for the good that they do 
in 'this life. It was left for Joseph 
Smith, the boy who sought the Lord 
in the woods, to receive the fulness 
of authority and power, and the 
principles of life and truth that 
should save mankind. 

We may, in our skeptical minds, 
object to the manner and method in 
which God revealed the truth in 
the last age, but if there were time, 
we would show that the way the 
Lord has worked among the chil- 
dren of men has always been taken 
exception to by the worldly intelli- 
gent, learned, prudent and wise. As 
the heavens are high above the 
earth, so are the ways of the Lord 
higher than the ways of man, and 
so are His thoughts more profound 
and deep. We have reason to re- 
joice and be exceeding glad that 
God in these last days has again 
spoken, through His instrument 
and prophet, Joseph Smith. 

My testimony to you, because of 
the experience that I have had, is 
that no man is qualified to teach the 
truth 'unless he be sent of God. He 
may attempt to teach the truth, may 
seek to preach the gospel, but the 
seal and power of God will not and 
cannot accompany his testimony and 
his words. The Lord has called 
men to proclaim His word, by di- 
vine authority, and I am sure that, 
as we have listened to the words of 
inspiration that have fallen from 
the lips of the Elders during this 
conference, our hearts have rejoiced 
greatly in the God of our salvation. 

I desire to say just one word by 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



way of admonition, counsel and ex- 
hortation, to the Latter-day Saints 
that are present here this afternoon. 
Let us go to our homes with a re- 
newed desire to practice the counsels 
that are given to us at our con- 
ferences, and for that matter, that 
are given to us every time we meet 
and listen to the servants of God. 
Let us be assured that they will 
never lead us astray, that God is at 
the helm, that this is His work, that 
He is inspiring His servants, and 
that this work will increase and 
grow, until it fills the whole earth. 
I rejoice in the beautiful principle 
that was touched upon by Elder 
Pratt. The day is hastening on, 
brethren and sisters, when every 
knee shall bow and every tongue 
confess that Jesus Christ is the Re- 
deemer of the world, to the glory of 
God the Father. 

I rejoice in the comprehensive- 
ness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
in its saving power ; and I rejoice in 
the principle that every soul will be 
judged according to their own 
works. I thank God for these pre- 
cious principles, that every man and 
woman who desires salvation may 
be saved. "Come unto Christ all ye 
that are weary and heavy laden, and 
you shall have rest." Go unto the 
. Master, ye that are burdened and 
weary with the cares and trials of 
life, or even with your sins. Go 
unto God and confess your faults. 
Hearken unto the voice of the men 
whom God has raised up, to whom 
He has given divine authority, and 
you shall know that God lives, that 
Jesus is Christ, the Redeemer of the 
world, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, entrusted with 
power and authority to minister in 
His name and to delegate that au- 
thority to others. As a result of his 



ministry, and the authority dele- 
gated to the servants whom God has 
called, this gospel has been carried 
to the various nations of the earth ; 
and this afternoon, in this beautiful 
space, we have the privilege of wor- 
shiping God according to the dic- 
tates of our conscience. 

My brethren and sisters, may God 
bless us and give us a desire in our 
hearts to live those principles that 
we received in our fatherland. May 
we seek earnestly for the faith that 
was once delivered to the saints. 
• May we believe with all our hearts 
in the gospel of gifts and blessings, 
the gospel of power and of redeem- 
ing grace. I thank God that I can 
bear testimony to these things, that 
God has in these last days spoken 
from heaven, has given divine au- 
thority to men, not only to preach 
His gospel, but to administer in the 
ordinances thereof, ordinances that 
bring spiritual and temporal life and 
salvation. When you look upon me 
and see the ravages that disease 
wrought upon me, you look upon a 
monument of God's saving power 
and mercy. I bear testimony that 
God lives, that all the world sooner 
or later will know this truth and 
believe it, for every knee shall yet 
bow and every tongue confess that 
Jesus is the Christ, to the glory of 
the Father. 

May we go home with renewed 
desires to serve the Lord, to give 
our life, in His service, and we will 
have joy in time and glory in eter- 
nity. May God grant it, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Prof. Wm. C. Clive rendered a 
violin solo, a beautiful arrangement 
of the old melody, "Home, sweet 
home." 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 



Ill 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 

(President of Bear Lake Stake.) 

To speak in the open air, my 
brethren and sisters, is . a new ex- 
perience for me. I therefore pray 
that the Lord will sustain me, that 
I may be able to be heard by this 
large congregation. I have rejoiced 
exceedingly in the testimonies of 
my brethren who have spoken here 
this afternoon, as well as in the 
proceedings at the regular meetings 
of our conference. 

One of the testimonies, it seems 
to me, of the divinity of the work 
in which we are engaged, can be 
witnessed upon this block when 
the semi-annual conferences of the 
Church are held. Where in the 
world will you find such a general 
response to the .call of any other 
church for a gathering of its mem- 
bers as you will see upon these 
grounds at each conference ? From 
all parts of this country the Saints 
gather to hear the word of the 
Lord. I doubt if such a sight as 
this can be witnessed anywhere in 
the world, tens of thousands gath- 
ered from various parts of the 
United States, from Canada, from 
Mexico, and from islands of the 
sea, to hear the servants of the 
Lord. When we witness the con- 
duct of these people who gather to 
these conferences, we also have an- 
other witness that they are engaged 
in the work of the Lord, for the 
test can be applied, according to 
the words of our Master, "By their 
fruits ye shall know them," and 
thus we may see that the people 
gathered at this conference, belong 
to the Church of Christ. We can- 
not gather grapes of< thorns nor figs 
of thistles. When we wish to judge 
a system, we must judge it by that 



which it produces. We must judge 
it by that which is manifested by 
the people, by their acts, by the lives 
of all those that belong to the or- 
ganization or system, and we invite 
the world to thus investigate "Mor- 
monism." We invite the world to 
compare the results of "Mormon- 
ism" with the results of any other 
system of religion that has been 
promulgated on the earth in these 
latter days. We are willing, with 
all of our weaknesses, to submit to 
that test. We acknowledge that we 
have failings, we know that many 
of us can improve in our lives, and 
yet, with all of this, we know that, 
as a result of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the organization which 
He has established in this day, that 
there has been gathered from the 
nations the best people upon the 
face of the earth. And this is as 
it should be. We should be as a 
light set upon a hill, whose light 
cannot be hid ; and if we are not 
better than the world, then we have 
failed in performing that which 
God designed that we should do. 

As I came to this conference, I 
came with a full car-load of breth- 
ren and sisters from our little town, 
and attached to the train was a car 
that had been set aside for those 
who wished to indulge in smoking 
tobacco. I am proud to say that 
that car was empty all the way 
along, and that not one of our 
brethren took advantage of it for 
that purpose. This is one of the 
fruits of Mormonism. We have 
some among us who use tobacco, 
but take the people as a rule, they 
are living godly lives, they are 
striving to redeem themselves and 
their families, and further than that 
to redeem the world. 

I want to impress upon you, my 
brethren and sisters, the necessity 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of our living good lives in accord- 
ance with the principles of our re- 
ligion. "By their fruits shall ye 
know them." I believe that the 
truths of "Mormonism" are having 
more effect in the world, and with 
those with whom we associate by 
reason of the every-day conduct of 
the Saints than by their preaching. 
I believe that by setting good exam- 
ples, by living righteous and pure 
lives, that we are making the great- 
er impression upon those with 
whom we associate. Therefore, how 
necessary it is that every Latter-day 
Saint, male and female, old and 
young, should realize that wherever 
they go, and under whatever cir- 
cumstances they may be placed, 
their lives should be such as to 
command respect, and be a silent 
witness and testimony to the world 
that their good life is a result of 
the teaching of that system of re- 
ligion commonly called "Mormon- 
ism. 

I have talked with many people 
who have come from different parts 
of the nation, business men, tour- 
ists, and others, and I say to you 
it is my opinion that the pure lives, 
the excellent example that is set 
by the Latter-day Saints as a peo- 
ple, is doing more to break down 
the prejudice of the world at large, 
and is doing more in commanding- 
respect, than any other thing that 
we can do. Again I say that is as 
it should be. We cannot expect to 
gather good fruit from a corrupt 
tree, neither will we get corrupt 
fruit from a good tree. These are 
the words of our Savior, and they 
are true. That is the test that will 
be applied, and, as I said in the 
beginning of my remarks, with all 
of our weaknesses, we are willing 
that this test shall be applied to the 



Latter-day Saints, as compared 
with other religious organizations. 

I presume that you will find no 
larger percentage of people who 
own their own homes, or who are 
independent so far as means are 
concerned, than among the Latter- 
day Saints. I presume you will find 
no people where education is valued 
higher than it is among the Latter- 
day Saints, where the arts and sci- 
ences are encouraged more ; nor a 
people purer in their habits and 
lives. I doubt whether you can find 
upon the face of the earth a people 
among whom. there are so few who 
indulge in the intoxicating drink 
habit, and in the use of tobacco. 
All of these things are evidence that 
the source from which the people 
get their instruction is pure, and 
logically, we must infer that the 
source, the Church, is of God, be- 
cause its teachings are uplifting, el- 
evating, and are producing in this 
western country a people who can 
stand up and look the whole world 
in the face, and are not ashamed of 
their religion. 

I repeat, this is as it should be. I 
wish to impress upon every man, 
woman, and child claiming to be 
Latter-day Saints, the necessity of 
living pure and circumspect lives, 
because wherever you go you are 
either supporting, encouraging, and 
working for the benefit of this 
Church, or else you are pulling it 
down — one or the other. Your con- 
duct in life will either add to the 
dignity of the Church or else bring 
reproach upon it. How pleasant it 
is to go into communities where the 
greater number of that community 
do not belong to the Church, but 
who speak well of some individuals 
in that community who are Latter- 
day Saints. On the other hand, how

discouraging it is if our young men, 
or older men, who may be work- 
ing or traveling among those who 
are not of our faith, conduct them- 
selves so as to bring reproach upon 
the Church. Let us live, my breth- 
ren and sisters, so that, whether we 
be at home or abroad, we always 
are witnesses for the kingdom of 
God, and are always seeking to 
build up the kingdom. 

We do not have to go upon mis- 
sions to perform missionary work, 
we can be missionaries at home. We 
can be missionaries in our traveling, 
wherever we may be. The gather- 
ings at these conferences are a tes- 
timony to the people that there is 
something behind' this work that is 
above the wisdom of man, and 
thinking people must come to the 
conclusion that it is supported by a 
divine power. How pleasant it is 
to see upon these grounds so many 
people who are not using tobacco. 
Wherever in the world can you find 
such a large concourse of people as 
are attending this conference and 
see so few who are smoking tobac- 
co? You cannot find it, you may 
go anywhere you please. Now this 
is a testimony that the work of the 
Lord is reforming the people. We 
have been gathered, as has been 
stated, from all parts of the world. " 
We have been brought here to learn 
of God's ways, and we are learn- 
ing of God's ways, and we are set- 
ting an example to the world. May 
God help us to let our light so shine 
that those who see our good works 
may be led to glorify our Father 
who is in heaven, and give credit 
to that organization which God has 
established in these last days for 
bringing about the redemption of 
mankind, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR. 

(President of Summit Stake.) 

The last time that I had an ex- 
perience of this kind was in the 
Southern States. It was in a place 
where many had not seen a negro. 
That may be a surprise to some of 
you people. A committee of citi- 
zens had invited a noted negro 
preacher to come out into the 
mountains of North Carolina and 
preach; and they had engaged the 
Methodist church. But when we 
went to the church to hear this 
great negro preacher, he did not 
come. Then the committee came to 
the Eiders and said, "You will have 
to take his place." We said to them, 
"We are in a Methodist church, and 
the Methodist minister is here. Go 
to him and have him preach." They 
went to him, and he said, "No, sir, 
I will not preach after you have 
asked the Mormon Elders. I will 
not do it ;" and he took his hat and 
went home. Then they came to us ; 
and we said that inasmuch as this 
was his church, we had rather go 
out under the trees and preach. So 
they invited the congregation out 
under the trees, and we deliv- 
ered our talk. I think the Lord 
sometimes opens the way for the 
Elders that they do not always have 
to hunt up congregations. 

Another time, when I was down 
in Tennessee, we had been through 
the country and made appointments 
for meetings. A man by the name 
of Turner had given us the privilege 
of preaching in the church at Bethel, 
at 11 a. m. The night before we 
had stayed a mile or two from the 
meeting house, and desired to get 
to the church at 9 o'clock for Sun- 
day School, but when we started 
out, and were going through the 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



woods in the morning, it seemed to 
me as if I heard a voice saying, 
"Don't go to that Sunday School," 
and I stopped. My partner had 
stopped and said to me, "Brother 
Taylor, the strongest impression 
that has ever come over me in my 
life has come to me that we must 
not go to that Sunday School." 
So we agreed that we would stay 
there. We stayed in the woods, and 
about the time for meeting, went 
down to the meeting house, and 
found all the shutters closed: There 
wasn't any Sunday School. There 
had been none held, and we won- 
dered what was the matter, but 
when we went to go, a man rushed 
up and said, "Do you know, when 
Squire Turner was entering the 
meeting house this morning, Squire 
Hawkins struck him in the face and 
knocked him to the ground because 
he had allowed you the use of the 
church, and Squire Turner and his 
friends, about thirty in number, and 
Hawkins and his friends about 
thirty in number, all had a free 
fight. Now," he said, "You men 
had better get right out of here just 
as quick as you can, Decause Squire 
Hawkins' men are gathered at his 
house, and Squire Turner's men are 
gathered at his house, and if they 
come here you will be killed." I 
thought, "Well, it will be a mighty 
good thing to get out.-" My com- 
panion, who was a little bit of a 
man, rose up in his dignity, and he 
said, "No siree, we are out here to 
preach the gospel, and we are going 
to preach it to you folks right here 
under the trees, and if you will stay 
here, we will talk to you. I thought, 
"Well now, we are in for it," but I 
got up along side of him just as 
bravely as I knew how. We got 
our hymn books and opened them 
up, and were just going to sing 



when a young lady came rushing 
through the trees and said, "Gentle- 
men, I am a daughter of Squire 
Turner. He is the man that gave 
you the privilege of the church, and 
he is your friend. Now, he is so 
enraged and so insulted with the 
fact that he has been struck, that 
he is gathering his friends, and just 
the minute you start to sing and 
commence meeting, they will start 
out and hunt up the other crowd 
and some will be killed." My com- 
panion said, "We are not here to get 
our friends into trouble, and we 
will go away." We started to walk 
down the road; and the same man 
came up and said, "Don't go that 
way, that is where Squire Hawkins 
lives. Go out this way." But my 
companion said, "We know some- 
body down here, where we can get 
a dinner, so that is where we are 
going," and we walked on. We 
came to a large mansion, and on the 
. lawn there were about forty men. 
Instead of going on the other side 
of the street, we kept on that side, 
and, wanting to be polite, I walked 
up to the fence and said, "Good 
morning gentlemen ; this is a beauti- 
ful day." Not one spoke back to 
me, but looked around on the lawn 
like they were hunting for four leaf 
clovers, and I said to my companion, 
"If they won't speak to us, we have 
done our part," and we walked 
along. The next day we were pass- 
ing by a hedge nearly as high as 
this wall, [Temple block,] and we 
heard two men talking. One of 
them was saying to the other, "Have 
you read the paper this morning? 
Well, there is a Mormon giant come 
into our community, and his name 
is Taylor. He challenged forty men 
to fight him yesterday, and they 
were all afraid of him." Now, I 
believe, you know, that the Lord

sometimes "magnifies us in the eyes 
of the people." 

We had appointed a meeting for 
the next day, Friday, and the min- 
ister of that place decided that he 
would hold meetings all day, (our 
meeting hour was four o'clock). 
He commenced at 10 o'clock with a 
prayer meeting, and went right on 
through the day. We went to hear 
his services, and a multitude of peo- 
ple gathered. About 3 :30 I remem- 
bered that I had left my Bible home, 
at, the place we stayed the night be- 
fore. I got up and went out of the 
meeting. Outside of the meeting 
house there was a pole fence, and 
some large trees on the other side 
of it. Under these trees was a 
crowd of men, and among them was 
the man that I had stayed with, so I 
climbed over the fence and went 
over toward him, and all the men 
separated. I went down between 
two lines of men, and said to him, 
"Eph, I forgot my Bible, and left it 
at your house ; give me the key, be- 
cause our meeting is going to start." 
He never said a word, but started 
off and climbed the fence, and I 
went after him. When he got into 
the lane and was going home, I said, 
"Eph, you haven't answered me yet, 
you have closed up like a clam." 
"Well," he says, "I was so mad I 
couldn't speak. Just before you 
came out of that meeting house 
those men had got a bucket of tar 
and a pillow full of feathers, and 
had said they were going to tar and 
feather you and your companion, 
and I had just said to them, 'the 
whole crowd of you darsn't lay 
your hands on that man Taylor, and 
if any one of you lay your hands on 
that man Church, I will grind you 
to powder." 

Now, the next day, we went to 
the place where the minister had 



deserted the meeting house, left the 
people without a preacher and they 
called upon us to talk to the people. 
I have the Yankee habit of whit- 
tling and, after the close of the 
meeting, I was over by the stove 
with a stick whittling. When near- 
ly all the people had gone out, a 
big fellow about six feet tall and 
weighing about two hundred and 
fifty pounds, said, "We want a sign : 
we want a sign : and then just as 
soon as you give us a sign, there 
are forty of us want to join your 
church." He addressed himself to 
me. I was whittling away, and said 
to him, "All right. How would you 
like to be struck dead?" ' He said, 
"Not that, not that, not that/' and 
backed out of the house as fast as he 
could, and all his crowd with him. 
As we were going to dinner that 
clay, he followed us up, and came 
shivering and shaking, and said, 
"Mr. Taylor, I do not want you to 
think I am your enemy. I want 
you to think I am your friend." 

While Brother Shepherd was 
speaking to us just now, there was 
a story came to my mind. The 
circumstance happened in the stake 
which Brother Shepherd comes 
from, and made a great impression 
upon my mind. President Budge, 
who used to be the president of that 
stake, told me the story. There is 
a man up there named Wright. He 
was in one of the wards, and took 
it upon himself, one day when the 
bishop wanted to present something 
for the benefit of the people, to op- 
pose that move. It didn't suit 
Brother Wright, and so he got up 
in the meeting and opposed it with 
all his heart. He got so anxious 
about it, and got himself so worked 
up and so mad, that he marched out 
of the meeting house ; but, as he was 
going out, just as he opened the 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



door, he saw a man standing there, 
who had been peeking, looking in 
through the crack. This man shut 
the door and said, "You've done 
just the right thing, you've done 
just the right thing." Brother 
Wright looked at him, and said, 
"Did you say I did the right thing? 
Then I must be wrong, because you 
have never been right — you have 
been wrong in everything that has 
happened in this community since I 
have been here, and because you say 
I am right I know I am wrong." 
So Brother Wright turned round 
and went back and said, "Bishop, I 
know I am wrong. Brother so-and- 
so met me outside the door and said 
I was" right, and I want to apologize 
because now I know I am wrong." 

I presume you have all been read- 
ing the inscriptions on the monu- 
ments. My father was with the 
Prophet and Hyrum Smith in Car- 
thage Jail, and he. was wounded in 
several places, and stood upon ex- 
actly the same spot as the Prophet 
stood when he was killed. When he 
was lying down and the doctor came 
in with a pocket knife, and was cut- 
ting the bullets out of him, he 
wanted to know where the Higbees 
and the apostates were who had 
brought about the martyrdom. He 
wanted to swear out warrants 
against them. The impression has 
always come to me that there is no 
man or set of men since the days of 
the. Prophet Joseph Smith, that have 
raised their hands against the 
Prophet of the living God and have 
prospered in the land — not one, and 
their names will go down to obliv- 
ion, while those who' stand up for 
and sustain the prophet of the liv- 
ing God will live forever, and their 
names will be perpetuated here on 
earth. 

Now, once in a while I hear some- 



one say about the Prophet Joseph 
F. Smith, that they do not agree 
with him, and at the same time ex- 
tol the prophets who have passed 
away. I want to testify to you to- 
day that one living prophet is worth 
more than a grave-yard full of dead 
ones. I testify to you that I want 
to sustain the living prophet, who- 
ever he is. Of course, in sustaining 
him, you sustain the others, but you 
cannot sustain the dead prophets 
and not sustain the living. That is 
absolutely impossible. 1 do not 
want to see the Latter-day Saints 
get led away by every fad and 
fancy. I say to you that the men 
of this nation, a good many of them, 
are striving right now to knock the 
cornerstone from under this gov- 
ernment. They are following a 
whole lot of fads and fancies, and 
if the Latter-day Saints live like 
they should be living, and . sustain 
the Constitution of the United 
States, they may soon be called up- 
on to govern ; but if they follow 
every fad and fancy, and do not 
keep on solid ground, they will 
never be able to rule. Good men 
and good women cannot help but 
be rulers in the land in this world, 
and in the world to come. But, 
when you follow the vices in the 
world down you go. 

I had an experience in Nevada 
recently. I was at a great big ranch, 
and on that ranch the foreman was 
a big man. I happened to be there 
negotiating for the purchase of it, 
and of course was a kind of an 
honored guest, and sat up near the 
head of the table. We had a man 
there that pretended to be an apos- 
tate, and rather boasted about it ; 
and one morning he commenced to 
talk about what foolery it was for 
us to drink water. When, the 
Chinaman waiter came and • saidL 



ELDER MOSE. 

"A little more wattee?" This man 
said, "Why don't you drink coffee 
and tea ? I do not object to you not 
drinking liquor or smoking tobacco, 
but it is nonsense not to drink cof- 
fee and tea." There happened to 
be a young man there, a grandson 
of Erastus Snow, a great big 
healthy fellow weighing over two 
hundred pounds. He was out there 
surveying for the Ranch Company ; 
and so I said to him, "Now, Mr. 
Snow and I are the only ones here 
drinking water, there are thirty or 
forty men around this table, all the 
rest of you drinking coffee and tea. 
We are willing to stand up and take 
an examination, physical, intellec- 
tual, or any other way against the 
whole crowd." The foreman of the 
ranch said to them, "He has got the 
dead cinch on you." When Brother 
Snow and I were alone I told him 
how I appreciated his conduct, for 
he was adopting the virtues of the 
men among whom he labored, but 
none of their vices. 

The next day the apostate took 
another tack. He said, "It's all 
nonsense for your elders to go into 
the world to preach the gospel, and 
oat the food of the poor people." So 
1 said to him, "Now, you have be- 
come a comparatively wealthy man, 
but you would have been living in 
Denmark and working for thirty 
cents a day if it hadn't been for the 
gospel. When the elders came to 
your father and mother they said 
this, 'We have a certificate from the 
prophet of the living God that says 
that every man, woman, or child 
that provides for the comfort of 
these Elders, shall be blessed of the 
Lord.' Now, I want to testify to 
you today, and I want you to agree 
with it, that the Latter-day Saints 
have been blessed of the Lord, and 
the people out in the world who 



W. TAYLOR 117 . 

have entertained them, have been 
blessed of the Lord." And he said, 
"Well, I guess that's true." 

Now, I say to the Latter-day 
Saints, you need have no fear to 
send your boys on a mission, and 
you need not be anxious to send 
them fifty dollars or seventy -five 
dollars a month either. I heartily 
agree with President Smith on that 
question. I have traveled without 
purse or script and got just as good 
treatment without it as I could pos- 
sibly get with it. It may be nec- 
essary to send some money, but do 
not send too much. I had the op- 
portunity of presiding for a short 
time over a mission, and I tell you 
that those who live nearest the gos- 
pel in that respect are the best 
Elders, and those most likely to 
make a failure are the boys that get 
too much money. 

Now, may the peace and blessing 
of heaven be with us, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 
Do what is right ; the 'day-dawn is break- 

Hailing a future of freedom and light; 
Angels above us are silent notes taking 
Of every action ; do what is right. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Tamihani Te Awe Awe.

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JE. 

Latter-day visions and revelations. — 
The sublime doctrine of salvation for 
the dead. — Temple work an important 
part of God's great plan of salvation. 
' — Organization of genealogical soci- 
eties-inspired by the Lord. — Vicarious 
work for the dead a serious responsi- 
bility. 

We have listened during the var- 
ious sessions of this conference to 
the preaching of the gospel in power 
and plainness, in such a manner that 
it must appeal to the souls of all the 
Latter-day Saints. With . you, my 
brethren and sisters, I have rejoiced 
in these principles which have been 
presented for our edification, and 
that we might be strengthened in 
the faith and live more nearly our 
religion which has been revealed to 
us from heaven in these latter days 
— the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. We have been taught faith 
in our Lord and Redeemer, and in 
the Father of us all; the necessity 
of repentance from sin; baptism 
by immersion for the remission of 
sin; and the reception of the Holy 
Ghost through the laying on of the 
hands of the Elders of Israel. We 
have been taught the doctrine of 
the atonement; the universal resur- 
rection of the dead, and the exal- 
tation of the righteous in the celes- 
tial kingdom of our Father. We 
have been instructed in our duties 
as members of the Church and as 
officers therein, by men holding au- 
thority, who have spoken as they 
were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, and who have not spoken as 
the Scribes and Pharisees, for the 
words which have been uttered here 
have been true. It seems to me they 
should appeal not only to the Latter- 
day Saints, but to all the honest in 
heart who may hear them. 

One of the things that is difficult 



for me to understand is why men 
will harden their hearts, and close 
their eyes against the truth when it 
is spoken in such plainness and 
power, accompanied by the Spirit of 
the Lord. We know these things 
are true, and that Joseph Smith was 
called and sent into the world to 
establish again the kingdom of God 
in righteousness, that the gospel of 
repentance might be preached in all 
the world, among all nations, kin- 
dreds, tongues and peoples, that 
those who believe and repent might 
come out of Babylon and be re- 
deemed from their sins. I rejoice, 
as my brethren have rejoiced and 
as the Saints have rejoiced, in this 
knowledge of the truth. 

There is one phase of this great 
subject of salvation that appeals to 
me, that I desire to speak of, briefly, 
this afternoon. It has already been 
alluded to in part. ( It is our duty 
to save the world. That is our mis- 
sion, in so far as they will listen 
unto us and receive our testimony. 
All those who reject the testimony 
of the Elders of Israel will be held 
responsible, and will have to give an 
accounting for their stewardship, 
just as we will give an accounting 
of our stewardship as Elders and 
teachers of the people.) 

Early in the year 1836, after the 
completion of the Kirtland Temple, 
the leading brethren of the Church 
assembled from time to time in that 
building in solemn assembly, to be 
instructed in their duues and to 
learn the Ways of the Lord. On 
these occasions preceding, at the 
time, and following the dedication 
of that house, the Spirit of the Lord 
was poured out upon them in 
power; the heavens were opened; 
many of them saw visions ; angels 
appeared to them, and they were 
instructed. Principles were revealed

that had been kept hid from the 
world, and on one occasion, on the 
21st day of January, while they 
were thus assembled, wonderful 
heavenly manifestations were given, 
and the Prophet tells us what he 
saw. Said he : 

The heavens were opened upon us, 
and I beheld the celestial kingdom of 
God, and the glory thereof, whether in 
the body or out I cannot tell. I saw 
the transcendent beauty of the gate 
through which the heirs of that king- 
dom will enter, which was like unto cir- 
cling flames of fire; also the blazing 
throne of God, whereon was seated the 
Father and the Son. I saw the beautiful 
streets of that kingdom which had the 
appearance of being paved with gold. I 
.saw fathers Adam and Abraham, and 
my father and mother, my brother, Al- 
vin, that has long since slept, and mar- 
veled how it was that he had obtained 
an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing 
that he had departed this life before the 
Lord had set His hand to gather Israel 
a second time, and had not been bap- 
tized for the remission of his sins. 
Thus came the voice of the Lord unto 
me, saying — All who have died with- 
out a knowledge of this gospel, who 
would have received it if they had been 
permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the 
celestial kingdom of God; also all that 
shall die henceforth without a knowledge 
of it, who would have received it with 
all their hearts, shall be heirs of that 
kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all 
men, according to their works, accord- 
ing to the desires of their hearts. And 
I also beheld all children who die before 
they arrived at years of accountability, 
are saved in the celestial kingdom of 
heaven. 

This was a glorious revelation of 
truth," not understood in the world 
previous to the receiving of this 
vision. And the Prophet saw that 
which was yet future, as well as 
what was already past, for he be- 
held his brother Alvin, who died 
before the gospel was restored; he 
saw his father and his mother tak- 
ing part in the glory of the celestial 
kingdom, yet his brother Alvin had 



not been baptized for the remission 
of his sins. The Lord says that we 
cannot enter there without baptism 
for the remission of our sins. Lit- 
tle children are redeemed, of course, 
for they are without sin and receive 
salvation through the atonement of 
Christ, which was made in their be- 
half as well as in behalf of all peo- 
ple. His father and mother were 
still living in the flesh, so he saw 
that which was yet future. Alvin 
died before he had the opportunity 
of receiving a remission of his sins. 
At the time of his fatal sickness the 
bringing forth of this work had 
merely commenced. lie approved 
of it and encouraged his younger 
brother to continue in the labor 
which the Lord had given him to 
do; but he did not enter that ce- 
lestial kingdom until after the gos- 
pel was restored to the earth in its 
fulness. And thenf the Lord taught 
the people, through His servant the 
Prophet, the means by which those 
who would have received the truth, 
but were denied the privilege, flight 
receive it and enter into this king- 
dom. We who have received it have 
the right and the power, which has 
been delegated unto us, to go into 
the house of the Lord and there be 
baptized in behalf of our dead, that 
they also might receive salvation in 
common with us, and this was done 
for Alvin Smith. It has been done 
for thousands and tens of thou- 
sands of true, faithful souls who 
were denied the privilege of re- 
ceiving the truth in the flesh, but 
afterwards received it and had a re- 
mission of their sins, after repent- 
ing of them, and received the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by proxy, according to the vi- 
carious work that the Lord has 
delegated unto us and commanded 
us to perform in behalf of the dead.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



All who would have received the 
truth will enter into that kinsrdom, 
those who have' lived in the ages 
past, when the gospel and the au- 
thority were not on the earth, as 
well as those who received it here. 
All, even down to the end of time, 
shall receive salvation who will re- 
pent of their sins and come unto the 
Lord with a desire to keep His cbm- 
. mandments and serve Him and 
obey Him in all things. They are 
heirs of the celestial kingdom. 
Therefore, as we have heard this 
afternoon in the singing of the 
choir, the Lord has prepared the 
temples so - that the Latter-day 
Saints can go to them, not only to 
receive ordinances in their own be- 
half, but that they might also per- 
form these same ordinances in be- 
half of their dead, that they might 
be redeemed from their sins, for 
they cannot personally receive bap- 
tism and the laying on of hands for 
the gift of the Holy Ghost now, be- 
cause those ordinances belong- to 
this mortal life. They have passed 
into the life beyond, therefore it is 
necessary that some one perform 
this work for them by proxy. This 
is not strange. Some people scoff 
at the idea and say that it is im- 
possible for one man to act in be- 
half of another, and yet they accept 
Christ as the Redeemer of the world 
and they say that He came into the 
world and took upon Him our sins, 
that we might be redeemed. He 
having power to do that for all of 
us, surely He has a right to say to 
us that we shall have power, in a 
lesser degree, to perform ordinances 
in behalf of others') And so He has 
done. 

Now, all who will listen to the 
truth and receive it shall become 
members of the Church of the First 



Born, and shall enter into the ce- 
lestial kingdom. Those who reject 
it after it has been preached to them 
will not have this privilege, as we 
have already heard at this confer- 
ence. Children are redeemed be- 
cause they are without sin. f Those 
who die without law will be re- 
deemed, because they will be judged 
without law, but all who have re- 
ceived law and who have known the 
truth in a degree will be judged ac- 
cording to the truth that they have 
known, and if they have not lived 
up to that which they have known, 
or which they have been taught or 
had the privilege of receiving, then 
they cannot enter into this celestial 
kingdom. It is, however, our duty 
to save the world, the dead as well 
as the living. We are saving the 
living who will repent by preaching 
the gospel among the nations and 
gathering out the children of Is- 
rael, the honest in heart. We are 
saving the dead by going into the 
house of the Lord and performing 
these ceremonies — baptism, the lay- 
ing on of hands, confirmation, and 
such other things as the Lord re- 
quires at our hands, in their behalf} 
But we are going to save even those 
who reject the truth, those who have 
been blinded by the craftiness of 
men, those who have received the 
truth in part, for not all who have 
entered into the kingdom of God 
shall enter into the celestial king- 
dom, for they will be judged, each 
one according to his works. Tf we 
have not kept the law of that king- 
dom ; if we have not been true to the 
covenants we have made with the 
Lord, then we will not receive the 
fulness of glory in His kingdom, 
and thus the scriptures tell us that 
those who are not admitted into the 
celestial kingdom, but into the ter- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

restrial are those who died without 
law, and also they who are the spir- 
its of men kept in prison, whom the 
Son visited and preached the gos- 
pel unto them, that they might be 
judged according" to men in the 
flesh. 

These are they who arc honorable men 
of the earth, who were blinded by the 
craftiness of men. These are they who 
received of His glory but not of His 
fulness. These are they who received 
of the presence of the Son but not of 
the fulness of the Father, wherefore 
they are bodies terrestrial and not bodies 
celestial, . and differ in glory as the 
moon differs from the sun." 

Following this remarkable vision 
and revelation of truth in the Kirt- 
land Temple just a little more than 
two months, other visions were re- 
ceived, they were the manifesta- 
tions of holy messengers in that 
same house. Among them came 
Elijah the Prophet, who laid his 
hands upon the head of Joseph 
Smith and upon the head of Oliver 
Cowdery, his fellow servant, and 
conferred upon them the keys which 
he held of the turning of the hearts 
of the children to their fathers, and 
from that time forth the spirit of 
Elijah's work, the planting in the 
hearts of the children the promises 
made to the fathers, was poured 
out upon the people. Not only the 
Latter-day Saints, but upon the 
honorable people of this land and of 
Great Britain and other nations of 
Europe. The Kirtland Temple was 
not a complete structure as we build 
T>"-.;Jcs today. No provision was 
made in it for the salvation of the 
dead. When it was built this glor- 
ious gospel of salvation for the dead 
was not understood, but in that 
building these principles were re- 
vealed, and when the Lord called 
upon the people later to build an- 



other temple to His name, he com- 
manded them to build in it a bap- 
tismal font and make it a structure, 
where the salvation of those who 
had gone to the great beyond might 
be brought about. The font was 
prepared in it, and the people went 
into it and were baptized in behalf 
of their dead. 

In the year 1844, the year of the 
martyrdom, a number of men met 
together in Boston, Massachusetts, 
and organized themselves into a so- 
ciety for the purpose of gathering 
up the records of the dead, filing 
them away and preserving them. 
The following year, 1845, their or- 
ganization was incorporated, and is 
known today as the New England 
Historical and Genealogical Soci- 
ety. From this time the spirit 
spread among the people until to- 
day similar societies can be found 
in great numbers of the states of 
. the American Union, in most of the 
countries of Great Britain, in some 
of the larger cities on the continent 
of Europe, in Scandinavia, in Ger- 
many, where the hearts of the chil- 
dren, since the restoration of those 
keys, have turned towards their 
parents. The^people are searching 
among the records of the dead, 
gathering them out, compiling them, 
publishing them, and making it pos- 
sible that the Latter-day Saints may 
obtain them, go to the house of the 
Lord and perform these ordinances 
— these saving principles in behalf 
of their dead. 

This is a great responsibility that 
rests upon us, for the Prophet says 
it is the burden of the scriptures, 
and if we fail to do it in behalf of 
our dead we do it at the peril of our 
own salvation. We cannot be saved 
without them, and they cannot be 
saved without us, that is the faith-

ful, because there must be a weld- 
ing, a joining together of the gen- 
erations from the days of Adam to 
the end of time. Families will be 
joined and linked together, parents 
to children, children to parents, one 
generation to another, until we shall 
be joined together in one great 
grand family with our father Adam 
at the head, where the Lord placed 
him. So we cannot be saved and 
exalted in the kingdom of God un- 
less we have .within our hearts the 
desire to do this work and perform 
it. so far as it is within our power 
on behalf of our. dead. This is the 
responsibility and the duty that rests 
upon the Latter-day Saints, and the 
Lord will hold us responsible, and 
we will not be found guiltless of the 
blood of our generation and of our 
relatives who were true and faithful 
to the truth so far as they knew it, 
unless we do something in their be- 
half. This is a glorious doctrine, 
one of the grand principles of truth 
revealed through the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. We should take ad- 
vantage of our opportunities and 
prove ourselves worthy and accept- 
able in the sight of the Lord, that 
we might receive this exaltation for 
ourselves, and. there rejoice in the 
kingdom of God with our relatives 
and friends in this grand reunion 
and assemblage of the Saints of the 
Church of the First Born, who have 
kept themselves free and unspotted 
from the sins of the world.} 

The Lord bless us and grant that 
we may have the desire in our 
hearts to magnify our 'calling and to 
serve Him in faithfulness in all 
these things, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Brother David Rees, and the 



choir, rendered the sacred song, 
"Hosannah." 

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Of First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters, Charles 
Dickens wrote, "If you would un- 
derstand the feelings of your fellow 
man, try to put yourself in his 
place." I realize the responsibility 
resting upon the brethren who arise 
to speak to this vast congregation, 
and I can say today, of a truth, that 
I have been greatly edified' and in- 
structed by the remarks of my 
brethren during the sessions of 
this great conference. Nothing 
of greater interest has trans- 
pired during our meetings than 
the salient points expressed by 
each speaker on the subjects by 
them handled. The address on the 
life of the Pioneer, Orson Pratt, re- 
minded the people of the labors of 
that great man, especially those who 
have been somewhat conversant 
with his life and history and his de- 
vout and unceasing toil for his fel- 
low man. We were reminded of 
his charming personality, and of his 
devoted friendship to all who had 
the pleasure of his acquaintance and 
friendship. This afternoon we have 
been interested very much in the 
subject of the temples of our God, 
and the work that has been done in 
these great edifices for the benefit 
of the living as well as the dead. 
In the dedication of the Kirtland 
Temple the Prophet Joseph gave 
utterance to this beautiful prayer, a 
portion of which I will read, found 
in the 109th section of the Book of 
Covenants : 

Thanks be to Thy name, O Lord 
God of Israel, who keepeth covenant 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG.

and showeth mercy unto Thy servants 
who walk uprightly before Thee, with 
all their hearts; 

Thou who hast commanded Thy 
servants to build a house to Thy 
name in this place [Kirtland]. 

And now Thou beholdest, O Lord, 
that Thy servants have done accord- 
ing to Thy commandment. * * * 

For Thou knowest that we < have 
done this work through great tribula- 
tion; and out of our poverty we have 
given of our substance, to build a 
house to Thy name, that the Son of 
Man might have a place to manifest 
Himself to His people. 

The following afternoon, Sidney 
Rigdon was called upon to speak, 
and given a portion of the time of 
the dedicatorial services. In his ut- 
terance of a great sermon — for I 
believe that he was under the inspir- 
ation of the Spirit of the Lord, for 
that was in the day of his fellow- 
ship with the Church and with the 
Prophet Joseph — he said: 

In times that have passed and up to 
the present day the Christian churches 
of all the civilized world have builded 
places of worship, houses where they 
have met together, and churches to 
accommodate the people in their re- 
ligious services, and one church has 
been dedicated to the name of Paul. 
Another church has been dedicated to 
the name of Peter, and another to the 
name of James and John, and so 
through the catalogue of names of 
holy men, of prophets and apostles 
that have spoken under the influence 
of the Spirit of the Lord, and so have 
hallowed their names and the memory 
thereof to future generations, and 
their names have been used, and the 
buildings of the churches have been 
dedicated to these prophets and apos- 
tles, and their names inscribed upon 
the lintel of the doorway. It has fal- 
len to the lot of a people who have re- 
ceived revelation through their proph- 
et today, and who have been organ- 
ized by the power of the Lord into 
quorums of the Priesthood, the de- 
spised people called Latter-day Saints 
they are the first to build a house of 
worship, and place upon it the name of 



Jesus Christ and devote it and ded- 
icate it to Him, and by the power and 
testimony that has rested upon the 
congregations of this people in these 
assemblages we know that it has been 
accepted by Him. 

The Lord chose a boy, if you 
please, as we were told yesterday. 
Joseph Smith was only a boy when 
the Lord called him, when appeared 
unto him the Father and the Son. 
They sent before them their mes- 
senger, the Holy Ghost, to rest up- 
on the boy to drive away from him 
the evil influences that were strug- 
gling to overcome him, and prepare 
him by the endowment of this holy 
power to receive the visitation of 
the Father and the Son. This was 
not the first record that we have 
of a like visit ushered in by a like 
presence. You remember what 
Luke says in regard to the birth of 
the Savior of the world, in the most 
ideal language that was ever used. 
No one of the evangelists comes 
near to him in the expression of the 
truth of that event as it occurred. 
The Angel Gabriel came to Mary 
and he said to her, "Hail, thou that 
art highly favored above women!" 
And she knew not what to make of 
the salutation and then the angel 
continued and said, "The Holy 
Ghost shall come upon thee, and 
the power of the Highest" — who is 
the highest? God the Eternal 
Father — "the power of the Highest 
shall o'ershadow thee; therefore 
also that holy thing which shall be 
born of thee shall be called the Son 
of God." 

So we know that the Lord can 
prepare the least of His servants 
or handmaidens for the labors and 
for the ministry that He places up- 
on them. We have another very 
glorious example of the Lord call- 
ing a small boy, much younger than 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Prophet Joseph when he re- 
ceived the visitation of the Father 
and the Son. I allude now to the 
Prophet Samuel. Samuel was given 
to his mother Hannah. She was 
the wife of Elkanah, a High Priest, 
and she was childless, and her sor- 
row knew no bounds. She sought 
the Lord in her home in her private 
chamber, and she also went to the 
temple and prayed upon the steps of 
the temple, without the door of the 
temple, and one day as she was 
praying for relief from her re- 
proach in Isarel, because she was 
barren, Eli in a heartless manner 
said to her— Eli, by the way, was 
the High Priest of the temple— he 
said to her, "How long wilt thou be 
drunken? put away thy wine from 
thee." And she said to him, "I 
have drunk neither wine nor strong- 
drink, but have poured out my soul 
before the Lord." When Eli heard 
this his heart softened and he said 
to Hannah, "Go in peace; and the 
God ^ of Israel grant thee thy peti- 
tion." We are told that she vowed 
in her heart and covenanted before 
the Lord that day that if He gave 
her a son she would devote him to 
the work in the temple of the Lord 
all his days. Sure enough, the Lord 
answered her prayer and gave her 
a son, and when he was of very 
tender years she brought him to the 
temple, and he made his abode there 
with the High Priest Eli, and slept 
near him in the temple. And one 
night a voice said "Samuel !" And 
the boy arose quickly and went over 
to Eli, and said to him, "Here am I ; 
for thou calledst me." "I called 
not," said Eli. Samuel returned to 
his couch again, and the voice came 
again to him, "Samuel!" And he 
arose again and went to Eli, but 
Eli said "I called not, my son." But 
after the third time, said Eli to him, 



"It shall be, if he call thee, that 
thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for 
thy servant heareth." So when the 
voice came again calling Samuel the 
boy answered accordingly, and the 
Lord gave him a commission, a 
command to call Eli to account for 
the wickedness of his sons. There 
are very many examples, very many 
records, but these are salient points 
that I think of now that will bear us 
out in the testimony that we give of 
the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Although he was 
called to the ministry when a mere 
boy, how well he filled that ministry 
and mission given to him by the 
Son of God. . How eagerly he gave 
the strength of his young manhood, 
as he matured in years and grew in 
knowledge, and as the Lord reveal- 
ed unto Him, line upon line, and 
precept upon precept, of how and 
when, and the proper way to min- 
ister in the Gospel ordinances ; and 
at the completion of the temple he 
gave this wonderful prayer, a por- 
tion of which I have read. About 
six clays after, the following .reve- 
lation was given to Joseph the Seer 
and to Oliver Cowdery : 

The veil was taken from our minds, 
and the eyes of our understanding 
were opened. 

We saw the Lord standing upon the 
breastwork of the pulpit before us, 
and under His feet was a paved work 
of pure gold in color like amber. 

His eyes were as a flame of fire, the 
hair of His head was white like the 
pure snow, His countenance shone 
above the brightness of the sun, and 
His voice was as the sound of the 
rushing of great waters, even the 
voice of Jehovah, saying: 

I am the first and the last, I am 
He who liveth, I am He who was 
slain, I am your advocate with the 
Father. 

Behold, your sins are forgiven you, 
you are clean before me, therefore lift 
up your heads and rejoice. 



PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 



125 



Let the hearts of your brethren re- 
joice, and let the hearts of all my peo- 
ple rejoice, who have, with their 
might, built this house to my name. 
* * * 

' And the fame of this, house shall 
spread to foreign lands, and this is the 
beginning of the blessing which shall 
be poured out upon the heads of my 
people. Even so. Amen. 

After this vision closed, the heav- 
ens were again opened unto us, and 
Moses appeared before us, and com- 
mitted unto us the keys of the gath- 
ering of Israel from the four parts of 
the earth, and the leading of the Ten 
Tribes from the land of the north. 

After this, Elias appeared, and com- 
mitted the dispensation of the Gospel 
of Abraham, saying, that in us, and 
our seed, all generations after us 
should be blessed. 

After this vision had closed, another 
great and glorious vision burst upon 
us, for Elijah the Prophet, who was 
taken to heaven without tasting death, 
stood before us, and said: 

Behold, the time has fully come, 
which was spoken of by the mouth of 
Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah) 
should be sent before the great and 
dreadful day of the Lord come. 

To turn the hearts of the fathers to 
the children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the whole earth be smit- 
ten with a curse. 

You have heard from Elder Jo- 
seph F. Smith, Jr., this afternoon 
in regard to the principle of bap- 
tism for the dead. This was the 
covenant that was established by the 
visit of Elijah, in fulfillment of the 
promise made to the Prophet Jo- 
seph when the Angel Moroni first 
visited him, and informed him con- 
cerning the plates, the record from 
which the Book of Mormon was 
translated. This work has been go- 
ing on since that day, sometimes in- 
terrupted by force of circumstances, 
in the times that the people were 
gathering from their homes in the 
east to this land in the great west- 
ern desert. As soon as the labors 
could be again perfected and a tem- 
ple could be built, the labor and the 



work has gone faithfully forward, 
and many hundreds of thousands of 
our dead kindred have received, or 
will receive the benefit of the ordin- 
ances performed for them in these 
holy houses which the Lord has per- 
mitted us and assisted us to build. 
Every one of them, all four temples 
in this country, have been dedicated 
to the name of the Lord God of 
Israel, and He has accepted of that 
dedication and allowed His name to 
be placed upon them, every one of 
those holy edifices. 

My brethren and sisters, I must 
not take more of your time. May 
the Lord bless you and increase 
upon you the desire to keep every 
commandment that He has given 
unto you, that you may have joy 
and rejoicing all the days of your 
lives, and be fitted and prepared to 
associate with those for whom we 
have labored here in the flesh, for 
the redemption of our kindred, as 
we shall meet them again if we are 
faithful and true. 

May this be our happy portion in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, I was in 
hopes that this task would pass by, 
as I have often said, preaching is 
not my forte. 

I have listened attentively to all 
which has been said during the con- 
ference, and I can endorse every- 
thing which we have heard. I real- 
ize that the Spirit of the Lord has 
been here during this conference, 
and has actuated those who have 
spoken to us. I trust that which 
we have heard will sink deep into 
the hearts of the people who have 
heard it, that we may all profit 
thereby. 

I ask God, the Eternal Father,. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to let His blessings rest upon all 
Israel and guide all of us in the true 
path, pour out His Spirit in rich 
abundance upon all who bear rule 
in His Church; that He may espe- 
cially bless those who are called to 
preside, the First Presidency of the 
Church, the quorum of the Apostles 
and their- associates. 

I trust that the Latter-day Saints 
may remember what they have 
heard during this conference, that 
they may go forward in the path of 
righteousness. I bear testimony of 
the goodness of the Father unto 
His people, and pray that we all 
may walk in the true path and be 
qualified for every duty, filling the 
mission whereunto our Father has 
called us, that we may be worthy of 
His blessings, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Saints advised to live in unity, and 
keep out of debt. — Statement con- 
cerning expenditure of tithing. — 
Reasons for the Church assisting 
in building Hotel Utah. — Voluntary 
obligation assumed by members to 
sustain Church authorities. — Bless- 
ings invoked upon Priesthood and 
People, and the Nation. — Mobo- 
cratic spirit a national menace. 

If there are any two individuals 
in this congregation, or who may 
have attended this conference, who 
have any ill-feeling in their hearts 
toward each other, or toward any 
one else, I hope they will go home, 
and that any or all others to whom 
the thought applies, will go home 
from here and be reconciled to each 
other, and become good neighbors 
and abide in good fellowship in the 
Church. If there is any one here 
who is in debt I would advise that 
when he goes home, and when I go 
home, too, that we will begin with 
a determination that we will pay 
our debts and meet all of our ob- 
ligations just as quickly as the Lord 
will enable us to do it. If there is 
any one here intending to go into 
debt for speculation, and especially 
if he is intending to borrow money 
to buy mining stock and other 
scaley or uncertain things, I would 
advise him to hesitate, pray over it, 
and carefully consider it before he

obligates himself by borrowing 
money arid going into debt. In oth- 
er words, keep out of debt if you 
can. Pay your debts as soon as 
you can. That means me as well as 
any one else. 

If there is any one In the congre- 
gation who has been negligent in 
observing the law of tithing, I hope 
he will go home from this confer- 
ence with a new awakening in his 
soul to keep this obligation that 
rests upon us as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, that there may be plenty 
in the storehouse of the Lord to 
meet all the necessities of the 
Church in a financial way. We feed 
the poor, and we maintain our tem- 
ples, we assist our missionaries to 
return from their missions, we sus- 
tain our Church schools, which are 
numerous, and expensive, and we 
are doing every other thing that we 
feel is wise and proper for us to do, 
with the means we have for the 
building up of Zion. We have suc- 
ceeded in purchasing, as far as we 
could,, the property that was offered 
for sale surrounding this -temple 
block, with the express intent to 
keep it from going into the hands of 
persons who would make an im- 
proper use of it. It has cost us a 
great deal, for generally when peo- 
ple realize that the Church wants or 
needs to get anything' they have for 
sale they want to get all out of it 
they possibly can. I am sorry to 
say that, but I suppose it is human 
nature for some people to do so. We 
have been under the necessity of im- 
proving some of this vacant land 
which we have purchased, and that 
has cost money, but now, instead of 
it being unoccupied, unimproved, a 
source of expense to the Church, we 
have built upon it and now it pays 
for itself, or meets its own obliga- 



tions and helps the Church just a 
little. 

We have helped to build one of 
the most magnificent hotels that 
exists on the continent of America, 
or in the old continent either. I am 
told that it is equal to any in the 
world, in its facilities for conveni- 
ence and comfort for its guests, for 
sanitation, for its situation, and 
architectural beauty, and in many 
other ways. Well, some of our 
people have thought that we were 
extravagant. I would like you to 
turn to the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants and read the command- 
ment of the Lord to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in the city of Nau- 
voo.* The people were requested 
to contribute of their means to take 
stock in this building, and they andj 
their children after them, from gen-I 
eration to generation, should have! 
an inheritance in that building; fori 
it was intended for the beauty of 
the city, for the glory of that stake 

*See Doctrine and Covenants Sec- 
tion 124:22-24. 

"Let my servant George, and my 
servant Lyman and my servant John 
Snyder and others build a house unto 
my name, such an one as my servant 
Joseph shall show unto them, upon 
the place which I shall show unto 
them also. And it shall be a house 
for boarding, 'a house that strangers 
may come from afar to lodge therein, 
therefore let it be a good house, wor- 
thy of all acceptation, that the weary 
traveler may find health and safety 
while he shall contemplate -the word 
of the Lord," etc. 

"This house shall be a healthy hab- 
itation," etc., etc., and again: 

"And let the name of that house be 
called Nauvoo House, and let it be a 
delightful habitation for man, and a 
resting place for the weary traveler," 
etc. (v. 60) And like the corner stone 
of Zion "Which shall be polished with 
that refinement which is after the 
similitude of a palace." (verse 2, sec 
124).

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of Zion, and to accommodate the 
stranger from afar who came to 
contemplate the doctrines of the 
Church and the work of the Lord. 

We are not responsible for the 
character of men who come here 
and are entertained in the hotel. 
We did not make or form their 
character, neither are we responsi- 
ble for their conduct. Men who 
come here to this city from the 
world are generally men of the 
world,, men accustomed to the hab- 
its of the world. Now, I hoped, 
nd I prayed, and I voted and did 
11 I could in the hope that the 
good people of this city would vote 
it "dry," so that we would not be 
compelled to allow a saloon or bar 
to be operated in the Hotel Utah. 
If you had voted it "dry," we would 
not have had any bar there. It 
would not have been necessary, be- 
cause the people that come here 
would have to put up with the law, 
and with the conditions in the city, 
but it "went wet" and therefore the 
people that visit us want something 
to "wet up" with once in a while, 
and unless it is provided for them 
they will go somewhere else, and in- 
stead of beholding and viewing the 
beauties of Zion they will go where 
they will see everything that is not 
beautiful, and be associated with 
that which is not good, instead of 
being where they can see the best 
side of everything. 

The building itself has been built 
by a company called the Utah Ho- 
tel Company. Not one of them is 
a hotel keeper. They know nothing 
about the science of hostelries, or 
of keeping a hostelry or managing 
a hotel, so they rented it. They 
have rented it to another company 
called the "Hotel Operating Com- 
pany." an operating company which 
has been formed with a capital of 



some $300,000.00, I believe, and 
they have rented the building and 
are responsible for the running of 
the hotel. They are paying those 
who built it, that is the "Utah Hotel : 
Company," the interest on their 
money as it falls due, and also in- 
terest on the bonds that have been 
issued for the purpose of obtaining 
the money necessary to put it in '■■ 
commission. Now, we do not want 
the Latterday Saints to go off and 
condemn Joseph F. Smith or An- 
thon H. Lund or John Henry 
Smith, or anybody else, because 
there is a bar in the Hotel Utah. We 
are not responsible for it. We do 
not go and drink there. We invite 
you to keep out of the bar and not 
go there to drink; you don't have 
to ; therefore we advise you on gen- 
eral principles to observe and keep 
the Word of Wisdom, both in the 
"Hotel Utah" and in your own 
homes, and wherever you travel. 
Keep the Word of wisdom, which 
is the word of the Lord to His peo- 
ple. I could say more perhaps, but 
I think I have said all I need to on 
that score. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
want to thank you on behalf of my- 
self and counselors, the Council of 
the Apostles,- the Seventies, the Pa- 
triarch, and the Presiding Bishop- 
ric, who are the general authorities, 
for the unanimity that has been 
manifested here by the uplifted 
hands of this vast congregation, 
with reference to the matters that 
have been presented to you. I un- 
derstand this as an evidence of 
good will, of faith and of fellow- 
ship on the part of this vast con- 
gregation to all the authorities, both 
general and local, or auxiliary, that 
have been presented before you, 
and that you will all abide the 
pledge you have given to the Lord 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



131 



and to one another by the uplifted 
hand, that you all mean to uphold 
and sustain these officers in all 
these various organizations, from 
first to last, that you will not back- 
bite them, that you will not find 
fault with them without a cause, 
that you will not try to injure their 
influence or hinder their progress, 
or interfere with their legitimate 
work but that on the contrary you 
will do everything you can to help 
them, to benefit them, bless them, 
and encourage them in the good 
work in which they are engaged. 

Now, may the Lord God Al- 
mighty bless and preserve His ser- 
vants from evil works, from all er- 
ror and mistakes. Oh, that the 
Lord God will guide His people 
and not leave them to the guidance 
of man. I testify to you that no 
man has ever led the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
in the sense that by his own wis- 
dom and intelligence, and by his 
personal power and influence he 
did it. I maintain and testify to 
you that it has been the power of 
God that has guided this people, 
from the Prophet Joseph down to 
the present moment. No man of 
himself is responsible for it. There- 
fore I pray that the Lord may 
bless His servants; that they may 
do nothing contrary to His will; 
that they may do nothing in- 
jurious to His work; that they 
may not lay any block or ob- 
stacle in the way of the progress 
of the kingdom of God ; that they 
may do nothing to grieve or hurt 
the feelings of the faithful children 
of the Father throughout all the 
Church. And I pray God to bless 
every organization of the Holy 
Priesthood that was revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
from the deacon to the apostle, each 



in its place, and each man in his 
place, and that the Lord may help 
each one to perform his duty, 
whether that duty may be great or 
small. 

I pray God to bless the teachers, 
the men that are called by the bish- 
ops and sent out among the Latter- 
day Saints to teach them the princi- 
ples of right living, principles of 
the Gospel, the principles of unity, 
of harmony, of righteousness and 
of equality and justice, the princi- 
ple of love and kindness between 
husband and wife, between parents 
and children, between neighbors, 
and in every way to teach the peo- 
ple righteousness, faith in God, in 
Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Spirit 
which proceeds, from the Father 
and the Son, and bears witness of 
them to the children of men ; faith 
in the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
in the divinity of his mission, faith 
in the intent and purpose and power 
of God to carry out His purposes 
and designs among the children of 
men, and faith in the destiny of 
God's work, in the destiny of His 
people, that we may not wander 
away nor be misled into error and 
doubt by those who are cunning 
and crafty, and who lay in wait to 
deceive and mislead the people of 
God, from their righteous ways. 

I pray God to bless all our auxil- 
iary organizations, from the first to 
the last, that they may do their 
duty, that they may not sit idly 
down and neglect to work. The 
idler is not in favor before the 
Lord, and he that is idle is in dan- 
ger of temptation, and of falling 
into the power of the adversary. 
We are only safe when we are do- 
ing, when we are at work, when we 
are in earnest, when we are en- 
gaged in the discharge of our duty, 
and when this condition exists with 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us we are safe, for then we are in 
the hands of God and not in the 
hand of the adversary. 

God, bless the Holy Priesthood, 
the noble men, pure men, just men,' 
men of honor, men of integrity, 
men who have gathered out, many 
of them, from the nations of the 
earth for the love of the gospel ; 
and many of them have been born 
under the covenant of the Holy 
Priesthood, and I pray God to bless 
you, my brethren, with an abun- 
dance of His goodness, of His 
mercy and loving kindness, that 
you may prosper in the land, that 
you may be indeed truly His ser- 
vants. 

1 pray you and I pray God to 
help you, fathers and mothers, to 
teach your children the principles 
and precepts of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, that they will grow up with- 
out sin unto salvation. I pray that 
God will help you to rear your chil- 
dren in the love of truth, in the love 
of virtue, free from the contam- 
inating vices of the world, free 
from defilement, from drunkenness, 
from the use of tobacco, from 
strong drinks and narcotics, and 
vices of every description; that 
you will teach them to be pure in 
their lives — in their habits, that 
they may be holy temples in which 
the Spirit of the living God may 
dwell and find congenial habitation. 
It is your duty to do it, and it is my 
duty; it is the duty of every man 
living to teach his family these 
things, and bring them up in the 
way they should go. 

May the Lord bless our Presid- 
ing Bishopric, on whom rests so 
much responsibility of gathering 
and assisting in keeping the rec- 
ords, receiving and disbursing the 
tithes of the people for every pur- 
pose for which it is appropriated 



towards the building up of Zion, 
the building of temples and school- 
houses, the compensation of teach- 
ers in our schools, the care of the 
poor, and the paying of other ex- 
penses. O, may the Lord bless our 
Bishopric that they may be fathers 
and not masters, that they may be 
tender in their hearts towards God's 
poor, and wise and prudent with 
reference to the "poor devils" who 
would impose upon them and up- 
on the Church if they could. May 
the Lord bless them with wisdom, 
knowledge and understanding, that 
they may not be deceived, that they 
may not yield to any kind of evil 
temptation, but that they may be 
true and faithful before God, that 
they will be able to give a faithful 
account of their stewardship before 
all the people of the Church, and 
when necessary before the people of 
the world, but more especially be- 
fore the great Judge of the quick 
and the dead, for it is to Him that 
we will eventually have to answer 
for every work and every word that 
we have done and said in this life ; 
for every man will be rewarded ac- 
cording to his works, whether they 
be good or evil. 

The Lord God bless Israel, not 
only all Israel but the honest in 
heart m all the world. The Lord 
bless the executive of this great na- 
tion, the man that stands at the 
head, together with his cabinet, that 
they also may be men of wisdom 
and of sound judgment, that they 
may be able to devise ways of peace 
and good will on earth, that there 
may be peace everywhere, that war 
may cease, that strife, contention 
and oppression of every description 
may be checked and subdued by the 
wisdom of the great statesmen and 
capable and honest judges of our 
country. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



133 



One of the greatest menaces to 
our country is that of the combina- 
tion of men into irresponsible, reck- 
less mobs, wild with prejudice, ha- 
tred and fanaticism, led by men of 
ambition, or passion, or hatred. 
There is no other thing in the world 
that I can conceive of so absolutely 
obnoxious to God and good men as 
a combination of men and women 
filled with the spirit of mobocracy. 
When men combine together to 
stop or shut off the food supply 
from the mouth of the honest la- 
borer, to starve the man that is 
willing to work, and the wife and 
the children who are dependent up- 
on him, because he is not willing 
to join a mob, is one of the most 
infamous perils and menaces to the 
people of our country today. I do 
not care who they are, or what 
name they go by. They are a men- 
ace to the peace of the world, and 
I hope and pray that President Wil- 
liam H. Taft, and his cabinet, and 
the Congress of the United States, 
will be able to devise means and 
measures by which the constitution- 
al laws of this government will be 
executed for the protection of the 
lives, the liberty and happiness of 
all its people, against mobocracy of 
every kind or description, whether 
it be in the form of soulless corpor- 
ations, monopolies or other combin- 
ations, it matters not to me. Let 
the strong hand of the government 
put a stop to anything that is tyran- 
nical and unjust, to anarchy and 
all else calculated to sow the seeds 
of destruction, poverty and ruin 
upon our. land. 

Now I must quit so you can catch 
the train. The Lord bless all Israel. 
The Lord bless our government 
and make it great, and help those 
who are at the helm to increase its 
greatness, that it may be sustained 



on the principles of eternal justice, 
righteousness and truth. 

I pray God to bless our choir, not 
only this choir, but all the other 
good choirs of the Latter-day 
Saints, and especially this on this 
occasion when it is about to 
start from here to visit New York 
and to sing for the world. .1 pray 
that the Lord will give them suc- 
cess, help them to win honor and 
laurels for the people of Utah, for 
the singers of Zion, and especially 
for the great Salt Lake Tabernacle 
Choir. The Lord bless Brother 
Stephens at their head, and Brother 
McClellan and those assisting them, 
that they may be true to their trust, 
honorable and faithful, and carry 
with them the virtues and honor 
that men cannot bestow, and can 
only exist in the souls of the right- 
eous. 

The/ choir sang the anthem, 
"God is our refuge and strength." 

Benediction was pronounced hy 
Bishop Charles W. Nibley. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 

Prof. Evan Stephens conducted 
the singing of the choir and congre- 
gation at • all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof. 
John J. McClellan played the ac- 
companiments, interludes, etc., on 
the great organ, assisted by Ed- 
ward P. Kimball and Tracy Y. Can- 
non. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken by Elders 
Franklin W. Otterstrom, Frederick 
E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker. 

The discourses delivered in the 
Tabernacle, reported by Elder Ot- 
terstrom, were transcribed by Mrs. 
John Meibos.

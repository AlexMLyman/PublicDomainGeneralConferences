of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints 

FIRST DAY. 



The Eighty-fifth Semi-Annual 
Conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints con- 
vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, at 10 a. m., Sunday, October 
4, 1914, President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

AUTHORITIES PRESENT. 

There were present of the First 
Presidency, Joseph F. Smith, An- 
thon H. Lund, and Charles W. Pen- 
rose ; of the Council of the Twelve 
Apostles, Francis M. Lyman, Heber 
J. Grant, Rudger Clawson, George 
F. Richards, Orson F. Whitney, 
David O. McKay, Anthony W. 
Ivins, Joseph F. Smith, Jr., and 
James E. Talmage; of the First 
Council of Seventy, Seymour B. 
Young, Brigham H. Roberts, J. 
Golden Kimball, Rulon S. Wells, Jo- 
seph W. McMurrin, Charles H. 
Hart, and Levi Edgar Young; Pre- 
siding Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith; 
of the Presiding Bishopric, Charles 
W. Nibley, Orrin P. Miller, and 
David A. Smith; Assistant Histor- 
ian Andrew Jenson. There were also 
a large number of Presidents of 
Stakes with their Counselors, Presi- 
dents of Missions, Bishops of 
Wards, Patriarchs, and numerous 
other prominent men and women 
representing various quorums and 
organizations of the Church. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 



the assembly to order, and an- 
nounced that, in consequence of the 
over-crowded condition in the Tab- 
ernacle, another meeting will now 
convene in the adjoining Assembly 
Hall, under direction of Elder 
George F. Richards. 

The conference services were 
commenced by the choir and congre- 
gation singing the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints 
No toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you 
This journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Joseph W. McMurrin. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
Palms." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Precautions taken for safety of mis- 
sionaries in Europe — General condi- 
tions of Church affairs reported — 
Missionary service neded at home — 
Active employment of all the Priest- 
hood advised — Reminder of duty to 
pray, and give thanks always — 
Christendom would not war if true 
Christianity prevailed — God not re- 
sponsible for war— Peace should be 
in hearts of Saints that they may 
disseminate it to the world. 

I suppose it is somewhat expected 
of me to make a few remarks at the 
opening of this, the first session of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Eighty-fifth semi-annual confer- 
ence of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints ; and, while I 
feel entirely inadequate to the task, 
I will try with the help of the Lord 
to say a few words as they may be 
given to me by the good Spirit. I 
feel truly grateful that my life 
has been spared to meet with you 
this morning under so favorable 
circumstances as those under 
which we have met. I am also 
grateful that my counselors have 
also been spared to be present with 
us, and also that the number of the 
Apostles has^ been unbroken since 
our last conference. And I am verv 
grateful indeed to behold so many 
of the Latter-day Saints as are as- 
sembled here this morning, appar- 
ently in the enjoyment of the many 
blessings and privileges of life 
which have been vouchsafed to the 
people of God and the Church up to 
the present. I sincerely hope during 
the sessions of this conference we 
may be fed with the bread of life, 
that the Spirit of the Lord may rest 
upon His servants, who may ad- 
dress the conference from time to 
time, .and that the same Spirit may 
rest abundantly upon all who as- 
semble from day to day to listen to 
that which may be said. 

It may be proper for me to say a 
few words relative to our foreign 
missions. I need not spend much 
time upon that subject as about 
everything that we have learned of 
the conditions in Europe, with ref- 
ence to our elders and the work of 
the ministry there, has been pub- 
lished from time to time in the Des- 
eret News and in other papers. But 
I think it will be safe for me to say 
that every precaution has been taken 
that could be taken for the protec- 
tion of our elders in those foreign 
missions where war exists. In Ger- 



many, France, Austria, and portions 
of other countries so dreadfully in- 
volved in war, our elders have all 
been invited to withdraw, to come 
away from those parts of the coun- 
try, and so far as we know our Ger- 
man missionaries have largely and 
almost entirely withdrawn from that 
country, and also from France. 
Some of them are located temporar- 
ily in Holland and in Scandinavia, 
and a few of them, quite a number 
indeed, have come across the Atlan- 
tic and have been distributed to the 
various missions in the United 
States, while those who had prac- 
tically completed their missions in 
Europe have been honorably re- 
leased to return home. Reports that 
we receive from England, notwith- 
standing the conditions of war that 
exist there, are that our elders are 
in safety at present, and that the 
field is opening before them with 
somewhat better prospects than 
heretofore. A great many people 
arc beginning to feel the necessity 
of praying for deliverance and 
safety, and as the spirit of prayer 
rests upon their minds, they begin 
to feel after their spiritual as well as 
their temporal welfare. Reports 
which we have received from Hol- 
land are very encouraging, indeed, 
and while the Presidency of that 
mission and of the Scandinavian 
missions have been instructed to be 
very careful about the welfare of 
the Elders, and if necessity arises 
to see that they are promptly re- 
leased to escape any difficulty that 
might come upon them, the reports 
from these missions are very en- 
couraging. They do not appre- 
hend, for the present, any difficulty ; 
and those who are laboring there 
seem to be contented and are doing 
good work. Nevertheless, they are 
all under instructions that when the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

necessity arises, our Elders who are 
laboring there now, apparently suc- 
cessfully, will be promptly released 
and guarded against any danger or 
evil, so far as it is possible. The 
poor Saints who are practically left 
without guidance of the Elders are 
feeling sadly the want of their pres- 
ence and regret very much that they 
have been under the necessity of 
withdrawing from among them. 
The best experienced men that 
could be obtained have been advised 
to take charge as far as possible of 
the local interests of the missions 
abroad, and possibly a few of our 
Elders will remain among them un- 
til the end of the war, provided 
they can do so without jeopardy to 
their lives. Now, I don't know that 
I need to say anything further in 
regard to these matters. Others 
who follow me, and who have more 
clearly in their minds other in- 
stances, can express themselves as 
they feel led. I believe that the best 
that could possibly be done has been 
done, and the wisest course that 
could have been pursued has been 
pursued with reference to our mis- 
sions upon the European continent 
respecting their release and their 
deliverance from trouble. I feel to 
thank God for all His' mercies and 
loving kindness to His people. 
£1 have before me a few memor- 
anda to which I will briefly refer. I 
am reminded that the winter season 
is coming and that it is advisable 
that all the Bishops should exercise 
fatherly and kind consideration to 
the needs of the worthy poor in 
their midst whether Latter-day 
Saints or not. The purpose of the 
Relief Societies is to assist the Bish- 
ops in relieving the necessities of the 
worthy poor; it is part of their 
first duty. ^ We should endeavor to 
take care, as far as possible, of the 



refugees who have been driven 
from their homes in Mexico, many 
of whom have established them- 
selves in various parts of the coun- 
try, and in various stakes of Zion. 
Some few have returned to their 
homes in Mexico, not without more 
or less risk of further trouble, and 
at present Bishohp Bentley is in 
charge of the colonies, or of the 
people who have returned to Mex- 
ico. How long they will be suffered 
to remain there in peace we cannot 
tell, but we sincerely hope and pray 
for peace throughout all the land., 
and in this hope we desire that the 
people will exercise all the faith 
they can in behalf of our associates 
our fellow members of the Church, 
in their endeavor to recover their 
homes and property from which 
they have been driven and very 
largely despoiled. 

In connection with the Presiding 
Bishop and one of his counselors 
I had the privilege of visiting, in 
August last, our settlements in Can- 
ada, and of holding conferences 
there in the two stakes. The walls 
of the temple, which is being erected 
at Cardston, are in process of build- 
ing. We have decided to build them 
of granite, and have already ex- 
pended a little over fifty thousand 
dollars toward the erection of that 
building. Had it not been for the 
great drought that has prevailed in 
that country for the last two or 
three years, and especially during 
this season, the temple, without 
doubt, would have been farther in 
progress than it is today. 

I am happy to announce, also, to 
the conference that we have com- 
pleted a magnificent new wing to 
the Latter-day Saints hospital. It 
has seventy-three private bed- 
rooms, splendid suites of operating 
rooms on the sixth floor, and an 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



open-air ward, on the roof, with a 
capacity of about thirty beds. It 
has ample kitchens and storage 
plants, and sub-basements, etc. It 
is one of the most beautiful hospital 
buildings in the United States, and 
the Latter-day Saints should re- 
member that we have a hospital of 
our own. 

We are also erecting what is 
called the General Church Office 
Building. It is progressing slowly 
but satisfactorily. It will provide 
offices for the First Presidency, the 
Council of the Twelve, the Presid- 
ing Patriarch, the Historian's office 
the Genealogical Society, and other 
Church organizations. I might add 
possibly without inconsistency that 
the progress of this building might 
have been a little more rapid if we 
had seen clearly our way to supply 
the means necessary to force it 
along a little faster. But we can 
only provide means for the improve- 
ments that are being made, not only 
for this building, the very costly ad- 
dition to the hospital, and that re- 
quired for the building of the tem- 
ple in Canada, but means also re- 
quired for schools and the assistance 
of the various wards and stakes of 
Zion to build numerous meeting- 
houses, amusement halls, and other 
places that are necessary for the 
use of the people throughout the 
Church. We have been pretty 
closely run for means and can only 
supply the money for these improve- 
ments and necessities as we obtain 
it from the Church. As the people 
pay their tithings, we are able to 
direct the application of it toward 
the improvements necessary to be 
made, as well as toward the meeting 
of all the current and reasonable 
expenses of the Church, the ac- 
counts of which are correctly kept 
to the very cent in the Presiding 



Bishop's Office, and also in the of- 
fice of the Trustee-in-Trust. 

Efforts to secure employment for 
immigrants, and for missionaries 
upon their return from their mis- 
sions, have been put forth to the 
best of our ability; and it is re- 
quested of the bishops everywhere 
throughout the Church to look after 
those who come to them from for- 
eign countries, who immigrate to 
Zion, that they may be assisted as 
far as possible, and put in position 
to acquire a livelihood, to build 
homes for themselves, and to feel at 
home amongst us. They come here 
strangers, meeting new conditions 
and depending much upon the fel- 
lowship of their brethren for their 
success in obtaining new homes. 

It is also a good thing for the 
bishops in all the wards to look after 
their returned missionaries. It is a 
pity that after so many of our boys 
who go abroad and fill good mis- 
sions return home, they should be 
apparently dropped or ignored by 
the presiding authorities of the 
Church, and be permitted to drift 
away again into carelessness and 
indifference, and eventually, per- 
haps, to wander entirely away from 
their Church duties. They should 
be kept in the harness, they should 
be made active in the work of the 
ministry, in some way that they may 
the better keep the spirit of the Gos- 
pel in their minds and in their 
hearts and be useful at home as well 
as abroad. 

There is no question as to the 
fact that missionary service is re- 
quired and is as necessary in Zion, 
or here at home, as it is abroad. 
Many people seem to be careless 
with reference to the proper train- 
ing of thir children. We see too 
many boys that are falling into very ' 
careless, if not into pernicious, ways 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



and habits. Every missionary boy 
who returns from his mission full 
of faith and good desire should take 
it upon himself to become a savior 
as far as possible of his young and 
less experienced associates at home. 
When a returned missionary sees a 
boy falling into bad ways and is be- 
coming accustomed to bad habits, he 
should feel that it is his duty to 
take hold of him, in connection with 
the presiding authorities of the stake 
or of the ward in which he lives, 
and exercise all the power and in- 
fluence he can for the salvation of 
that erring young man who has not 
the experience that our Elders 
abroad have had, and thus become 
a means of saving many and of es- 
tablishing them more firmly in the 
truth. 

Efforts have been made by the 
Presiding Bishopric and others to 
locate the Saints, who gather from 
other lands, where they can get a 
livelihood. All are employed as far 
as the records show. Many bish- 
ops have taken fatherly interest in 
the Saints who have immigrated to 
Zion. Homes have been provided, 
employment secured as far as pos- 
sible, and through the united efforts 
of the Saints, supplies and furniture 
have been .obtained and given them 
to help them to get started again in 
life. This should be the policy of 
all the organizations of the Church. 

Since the last April conference the 
Shelley stake of Zion has been or- 
ganized from a part of the Black- 
foot stake. Nine new wards, and 
seven new branches, have been or- 
ganized. Thirty-four bishops have 
been ordained to replace those who 
have been released. The presiden- 
cies of the Jordan, Juab, Union and 
North Sanpete stakes have been re- 
organized. Three bishops have 
passed away since our last confer- 



ence. There are now sixty-six stakes 
of Zion, and seven hundred and 
thirty-five bishops' wards. There 
have been entered on the records of 
the Church, by baptism, in the stakes 
and missions, six thousand one hun- 
dred and ninety-eight souls during 
the six months of the year. The pre- 
siding bishopric have issued quar- 
terly bulletins which have kept pres- 
idencies of stakes in closer touch 
with the general conditions in all 
the stakes of Zion, than in the past. 
Ward teaching is being rapidly de- 
veloped in many of the stakes of 
Zion. Some stakes are still indiffer- 
ent to this important movement. 
There is a splendid opportunity in 
this work to use every ordained 
priest and teacher and man holding 
the priesthood, and it would seem 
rather strange that there should be 
any of the presidencies of the stakes, 
or any of the presiding officers in 
the Church, who would be indiffer- 
ent to the subject of keeping in con- 
tact and in harmony with the prog- 
ress of all the other stakes. It is 
good to be in possession of the 
knowledge of things as they are and 
as they are going along. 

We have inaugurated a move- 
ment to encourage the monthly pay- 
ment of tithing. The stake and ward 
officers are complying with this re- 
quest as far as they can. Really, 
the only practical method and 
proper way to pay our tithes it. 
when we receive that which we earn 
into our hands. It is quite proper 
to remember what we owe to the 
Lord before we epend our means 
otherwise. 

There are two companies each 
day passing through this Temple to 
perform the ordinances of the 
House of the Lord for the living 
and for the dead, and our gene- 
alogical work is bearing fruit as we 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



see in the attendance upon the tem- 
ples for the performance of these 
ordinances, and we hope that this 
good work will go on. The work of 
the bishopric is both temporal and 
spiritual. The average bishop gives 
. all his time and efforts for the bet- 
terment of the people over whom he 
presides. The bishop should not try 
to do all the work that is necessary 
to be done in his ward. His coun- 
selors are there to help him, and a 
due portion of the responsibility of 
the bishop of the ward should be 
placed upon his counselors. Neither 
is it wise that the bishopric of the 
ward should feel they are com- 
pelled to do all that is necessary to 
be done in their wards. They should 
exercise their right to call upon the 
priesthood to visit the people as 
teachers and preachers qf the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ that they may give 
to all as far as possible an oppor- 
tunity to exercise their talents and 
to do good in their wards. It is 
sometimes advisable to give to each 
counselor special duties, and assign 
each of the counselors his propor- 
tion of the responsibilities which be- 
long to the bishopric, each one doing 
some special work for which he is 
adapted, so that all may be active. 

Now, these are a few things I 
think worthy of note, and there are 
very many more. But I desire to 
call attention to one thing ; it is this : 
I fear the Latter-day Saints, in the 
midst of the prosperity with which 
they are blessed, sometimes fail to 
observe that great commandment 
given of the Master, always to re- 
member the Lord, to . pray in the 
morning, and in the evening, and 
always remember to thank Him for 
the blessings that they receive day 
by day. I fear that there is more 
neglect than there should be among 
the Latter-day Saaints in regard to 



following out this rule of the 
Church. It is the commandment of 
the Lord that we shall remember 
God morning and evening, and, as 
the Book of Mormon tells us, "at all 
times." We should carry with us 
the spirit of prayer throughout ev- 
ery duty that we have to perform in 
life. Why should we ? One of the 
simple reasons that appeals to my 
mind with great force is that man is 
so utterly dependent upon God! 
How helpless we are without Him ; 
how little can we do without His 
merciful providence in our behalf! 
I have often been led to make the 
remark, that not one of us, not a hu- 
man being in all the world can make 
even a single spear of grass grow 
without the help of God. We have 
to use His earth, we must avail 
ourselves of the benefit of His soil. 
His air and His sunshine, and the 
moisture that God provides and 
gives to the earth, to enable us to 
produce even a single blade of 
grass; and the same applies to ev 
erything that ministers to our exis- 
tence in the world. You can't raise 
an ear of corn or wheat without 
God's help. You cannot produce a 
single thing essential to the exist- 
ence of man or beast without the 
help of God. Then, why should we 
not feel dependent upon the Lord? 
Why should we not call upon His 
name ? Why should we not remem- 
ber Him in our prayers? Why 
should we not love Him with all 
our heart and mind and strength, 
since He has given us life, since He 
has formed us in His own likeness 
and image, since He has placed us 
here that We may become like unto 
His only begotten Son and to in- 
herit the glory, exaltation and re- 
ward provided for God's own chil- 
dren. 

My brethren and sisters, let us re- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

member and call upon God and im- 
plore His blessings and His favor 
upon us. Let us do it nevertheless 
in wisdom and in righteousness, and 
when we pray we should call upon 
Him in a consistent and reasonable 
way. We should not ask the Lord 
for that which is unnecessary or 
which would not be beneficial to us. 
We should ask for that which we 
need, and we should ask in faith, 
"nothing wavering, "for he that 
wavereth," as the Apostle said, "is 
like the wave of the sea, driven by 
the wind and tossed. For let not 
that man think that he shall receive 
anything of the Lord." But when 
we ask of God for blessings let us 
ask in the faith of the Gospel, in 
that faith that He has promised to 
give to them who believe in Him 
and obey His commandments. 

We want peace in the world. We 
want love and good-will to exist 
throughout the earth, and among 
all the peoples of the world; but 
there never can come to the world 
that spirit of peace and love that 
should exist until mankind will re- 
ceive God's truth and God's mes- 
sage unto them and acknowledge 
His power and authority which is 
divine, and never found in the wis- 
dom only of men. 

The condition of the world today 
presents a spectacle that is deplora- 
ble, so far as it relates to the re- 
ligious convictions, faith and power 
of the inhabitants of the earth. Here 
we have nations arrayed against na- 
tions, and yet in every one of these 
nations are so-called Christian peo- 
ples professing to worship the same 
God, professing to possess belief in 
the same divine Redeemer, many oi 
them professing to be teachers of 
God's word, and ministers of life 
and salvation to the children of men, 
and yet these nations are divided 



one against the other, and each is 
praying to his God for wrath upon 
and victory over his enemies and for 
his own preservation. Would it be 
possible — could it be possible, for 
this conditions to exist if the people 
of the world possessed really the 
true knowledge of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ? And if they really 
possessed the Spirit of the living- 
God — could this condition exist? 
No; it could not exist, but war 
would cease, and contention and 
strife would be at an end. And not 
only the spirit of war would not 
exist, but the spirit of contention 
and strife that now exists among 
the nations of the earth, which is 
the primal element of war, would 
cease to be. We know that the 
spirit of strife and contention exists 
to an alarming extent among all the 
people of the world. Why does it 
exist? Because they are not one 
with God, nor with Christ. They 
have not entered into the true fold, 
and the result is they do not pos- 
sess the spirit of the true Shepherd 
sufficiently to govern and control 
their acts in the ways of peace and 
righteousness. Thus they contend 
and strive one against another, and 
at last nation rises up against nation 
in fulfilment of the predictions ot 
the prophets of God that war should 
be poured out upon all nations. I 
don't want you to think I believe 
that God has designed or willed that 
war shohuld come among the people 
of the world, that the nations of the 
world should be divided against 
each other in war, and engaged- in 
the destruction of each other ! God 
did not design or cause this. It is 
deplorable to the heavens that such 
a condition should exist among 
men, but the conditions do exist, 
and men precipitate war and de- 
struction upon themselves because

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of their wickedness, and that be- 
cause they will not abide in God's 
truth, walk in His love, and seek 
to establish and maintain peace in- 
stead of strife and contention in the 
world. 

Now, we wish this morning to re- 
member the admonition of the Pres- 
ident of the United States, to offer 
prayer for peace to come upon the 
distracted nations of the world, for 
peace to abide upon those who are 
at peace, and to abound more abund- 
antly. I pray God that this spirit 
.may especially enter into the hearts 
-of this people, that they may strive 
for peace among themselves, that 
peace may dwell in their, own hearts 
and homes, that peace may exist be- 
tween neighbors, that peace, good- 
will, love and union may character- 
ize the associations of members of 
the Church with their fellow mem- 
bers, and that there may be no con- 
tention among them, nor strife, nor 
bitterness, nor back-sliding, nor 
back-biting, nor complaint of any 
description, but that peace on earth 
and good will to men may pervade 
the hearts and minds of all the 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; and 
that from them this spirit of peace 
and love for God and for our fel- 
low man may go out into the world, 
as far as we have power to send it 
forth through the elders of the 
Church and otherwise, that men 
may hear the good tidings and re- 
ceive them in their hearts, obey the 
truth, and join the ranks of the 
peaceful, of the peace-loving, of the 
peace-makers, of the God-fearing, 
and of the God-loving people that 
all Latter-day Saints should be, in 
every part of the world. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, I humbly pray ; and now we 
will call upon President Charles W. 



Penrose to offer to the Lord a 
prayer in behalf of this assembly 
and in behalf of all the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints that God will move upon 
the hearts of the people of the 
world to accept the spirit of peace 
in their souls, that peace may come 
to the distracted world, apd that 
life and union may prevail instead 
of bloodshed, death and destruction. 
When Brother Penrose shall pray, 
he will pray unto the Father of our 
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in 
whose image and likeness we are 
made, or were born into the world, 
and in whose likeness and image we 
are, for we are God's children and 
therefore must resemble His Son in 
person, and also spiritually, so far 
as we will obey the principles of the 
gospel of eternal truth. For we 
were fore-ordained and predestined 
to become conformed to His like- 
ness through the wise and proper 
use of our free agency. So that we 
may enjoy the blessings of the king- 
dom of God where He dwells, and 
inherit His glory and the salvation, 
the reward, and dominion that has 
been promised unto the faithful of 
His children, which may God grant 
is my prayer. Amen.

A PRAYER FOR PEACE, 

O God, our . Eternal Father 
Father of the spirits of all men, we 
come unto Thee in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, and 
worship Thee and render thanks 
unto Thee for all things that we 
haye received, both spiritual and 
temporal, for our sustenance, for 
our guidance, for our enlighten- 
ment, for our understanding and 
knowledge, that we may be prepared 
to come into Thy presence, eventn-

ally and be crowned with eternal 
lives. Wilt Thou accept of our 
thanksgiving this morning for all 
Thy favors and look in mercy upon 
us and unite our hearts together un- 
der the influence of Thy Divine 
Spirit, that we may be one in very 
deed and that our supplications may 
come up unto Thee acceptable. For- 
give us of all our sins, our follies, 
our imperfections, our unworthi- 
ness, our lack of obedience unto Thy 
commandments and Thy counsels, 
and wherein we have in any way of- 
fended Thee, we crave Thy pardon 
and forgiveness. We ask Thee, our 
Eternal Father, to look in mercy 
upon the nations of the earth. They 
are Thy children, even though they 
may have gone astray, and have 
been stirred up in bitterness and in 
anger unto war one with another, 
wilt Thou, O Lord, look down upon 
them in Thy loving tenderness and 
kindness and Thy mercy upon them 
and prepare the way whereby war 
may cease and peace may be estab- 
lished. 

Thou hast inspired Thy prophets 
in days of old and in these latter 
days to predict that the day would 
come when men would cease their 
strife and would study war no more, 
when they would turn their weap- 
ons of destruction into agencies of 
peace for the cultivation of the 
earth and for the development of 
its resources, and we pray,' our 
Father, that that time may be hast- 
ened. Wilt Thou look down in 
mercy upon the rulers of the na- 
tions, upon all who have part in the 
conduct of human affairs in the va- 
rious governments in the world, and 
cause Thy divine spirit to shine up- 
on their understandings and to 
touch their hearts, that they may feel 
the absolute need of establishing 
peace on the earth, drawing the peo- 



ple of the world together in frater- 
nity instead of going forth upon the 
field of battle to destroy each other's 
lives. 

O Lord, look in mercy upon the 
wives and the children and other 
relatives of those who are now per- 
sonally engaged in the strife that is 
causing bloodshed and horror 
throughout the continent of Europe. 
Have mercy upon them, O Lord, 
and turn aside the outpouring of the 
spirit of war, and grant that the 
angel of peace may hover over the 
nations and that the influences flow- 
ing from his presence may come 
down upon them; that the wives 
and the children may be relieved of 
their sufferings, and that their loved 
ones may be restored to them — 
those that remain of them who are 
striving against each other, and 
may they who seek to establish un- 
righteousness and untruth and op- 
pression and tyranny not succeed. 
We ask Thee, O Lord, to look in 
mercy upon those nations. No mat- 
ter what may have been the cause 
which has brought about the tu- 
mult and the conflict now prevail- 
ing, wilt Thou grant, we pray 
Thee, that it may be overruled for 
good, so that the time shall come 
when, though thrones may totter 
and empires fall, liberty and free- 
dom shall come to the oppressed na- 
tions of Europe, and indeed 
throughout the world. We pray 
that liberty may come out of this 
oppression, that freedom may come 
out of this strife; and wilt Thou 
grant that in Thy divine providence 
all things may conspire together 
for good, so that righteousness may 
be established, that the fruit of 
righteousness, which is peace, may 
be enjoyed. 

Wilt Thou grant, Heavenly Fath- 
er, that the Spirit of the Lord may

GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



rest down mightily upon Thy peo- 
ple, even Thy Saints, those who are 
assembled here in conference and 
those whom they represent in the 
various stakes of Zion and the mis- 
sions abroad, and grant that they 
may obey the instructions that have 
been imparted and dwell together in 
peace. May there be no spirit of 
enmity or of strife among Thy 
Saints. Do Thou grant that they 
may be able to understand each 
other, that they may be able to ac- 
cord to each other that liberty which 
they desire for themeslves, so that 
though, they may differ in opinions 
and in views, they may accede and 
concede to others that liberty which 
every man should enjoy under the 
Constitution of the United States 
which Thou didst raise up good and 
wise men to establish, and grant,, 
O Lord, that there may be no real 
spirit of strife among them, that 
Thy Saints, as neighbors, may dwell 
together in amity and in brotherly 
love and in unity, and may this 
peace prevail throughout the land 
of Zion, that Zion may be indeed 
the pure in heart, those that serve 
God and keep His commandments. 

Now, O Lord, we unite with all 
who are praying unto Thee this day 
to ask Thee that in Thy mercy, in 
Thy providence, this terrible slaugh- 
ter may soon be brought to an end ; 
that the spirit of strife may depart ; 
that the spirit of peace may brood 
over the nations, so that all these 
terrors that have come may speed- 
ily pass away and that Thy right- 
eous purposes may be accomplished, 
that good may come to the world, 
and the way be prepared for the 
coming of the King of rea.ee, even 
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our elder 
Brother in the spirit, whom we love 
and adore this day, and in whose 
holy name we come unto Thee. 



"Wilt Thou hear our prayers, O God, 
the Ruler of nations, the Might) 
One on high I Wilt Thou Took 
down in mercy upon the world, and 
wilt Thou cause the spirit of peace 
to come forth to accomplish that 
which we desire in our hearts. YW 
know, O Lord, that Thy purposes 
shall be accomplished; we do not 
wish to step in the way or to attempt 
to hinder them in any degree, but 
we come unto Thee and express the 
desires of our souls, Thy children, O 
Lord, plead with Thee that peace 
may come and that the time may 
soon arrive when Thy will shall be 
done on earth as it is done in 
heaven. We dedicate ourselves and 
all that we have and all that we are 
unto Thy service, and desire to be 
ambassadors of peace, to carry witli 
us the spirit of peace, to have it in 
our hearts, to have it in our homes, 
to have it prevail throughout out- 
land and go forth from Zion to the 
uttermost parts of the earth ; and to 
this end we dedicate ourselves and 
all we have and are unto Thee, and 
ask these favors at Thine hands, in 
the name. of Jesus Christ . Amen.

and what I say unto one I say unto 
all, be of good cheer, little children, 
for I am in your midst, and I have 
not forsaken you; 

"And inasmuch as you have hum- 
bled yourselves before me, the bless-

I have been very much pleased 
this morning with all that has taken 
place in this meeting; I have fol- 
lowed with interest the remarks of 
our President, and I hope that we 
will all remember the instructions 
that he has given us. We all took 
part with President Penrose in that 
beautiful prayer, in which we peti- 
tioned our Heavenly Father to be 
merciful to His children who are 
now in the war-ridden zones of the 
world. I admire the head of this 
nation for his belief in the efficacy 
of prayer, and his having appointed 
this day for the whole nation to 
come before the Lord and petition 
Him for peace in Europe and in 
countries where there is war. I 
believe in prayer. I know I am ad- 
dressing a people this morning who 
are a prayerful people, who have 
oftentimes felt convinced that their 
prayers have been heard and an- 
swered, and who are firm in the con- 
viction that God answers prayers 
today as well as formerly. 

We have many instances on rec- 
ord in the Holy Scriptures, both the 
Bible and the Hook of Mormon, that 
God hears prayers, From Adam, 
the first who offered prayer, and 
down through history, we have seen 
that the Lord has lent ear to peti- 
tions which have been made to Him. 
Before Adam withered his i'b','ht 



eons posterity around him, in 
Adam-Ondi-Ahman, he had taught 
them about the true God and the ef- 
ficacy of prayer, so that they knew 
to whom to pray; and after the 
Hood we find holy men approaching 
our Father in prayer, and that He 
was merciful to them. Abraham 
Gideon, David,* Solomon, the proph 
ets ,all bear testimony to the value 
of prayer. Our Savior, dtfrjng His 
life upon the earth, inculcated 
prayer, and He would often with- 
draw Himself from His disciples, go 
up into the mountain and commune 
with God. He felt the necessity of 
obtaining aid and assistance from 
His Father in heaven, to perform 
Ilia! j', real mission which had been 
given Him here upon the earth. He 
taught His disciples to pray. He did 
not want them to make many repe- 
titions, He did not want them to 
pray to be considered of men, but 
He wanted them to come as chil 
dren to their Father, and ask for 
the things they stood in need of. 
That beautiful prayer, "Our Father, 
which art in heaven," that has been 
for generations a model to worship- 
ers, contains so much for serious 
thought, and it shows the plain and 
simple manner in which Jesus want- 
ed us to come before the Lord, not 
using high-sounding words, uut to 
approach I lim as a child would its 
father, and ask for the very things 
we stand in need of. I don't believe 
that He meant for us always to use 
that formula of prayer, but He gave 
it to us ,as an example, that when 
we pray we should pray in a similar 
manner. On one occasion when He 
was with His disciples, He told them 
that whatsoever they should .ask in 
His name should be granted. What 
a splendid promise 1 And I believe 
this promise is given not only to the 
disciples that surrounded Him at the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



time, but to all who believe in the 
Son of God. I believe also that 
when we approach our Father, He 
knows before we ask what we want, 
and He also knows whether that 
which we ask of Him is for our best 
good or not, yet He has commanded 
us to pray and open our hearts to 
Him. When Jesus was suffering in 
the Garden of Gethsemane, he asked 
the Lord, if it were possible, to 
take that bitter cup away from Him. 
Can you wonder at it when you re- 
member that He was in such agony 
that the sweat fell like drops of blood 
upon the ground? But He added, 
"Not my will, but thy will be done," 
giving us a pattern to follow m our 
prayers, that although we ardently 
desire certain things ; and believe 
that they would be for our best good 
still we should be submissive to the 
Father's will, and say, with Christ, 
not our will, but His will be done. 

In the prayer that He taught His 
discipes Jesus emphasized the great 
principle that God is our Father, 
and that we should address Him as 
such in our prayers. We believe 
that God is the Father of our spir- 
its, and hence that we are in reality 
His children. When Jesus so ad- 
dressed the Father, it was not a 
figurative title given Him, but it 
means that God is indeed our Father 
as He was His Father; Jesus was 
His only begotten Son in the flesh. 
Paul says that God is the Father of 
our spirits, and knowing this, we 
can approach Him in confidence, 
knowing that He will hear and 
grant unto us such blessings as will 
be for our good. In that prayer we 
are told to say, "Hallowed be Thy 
name," and in doing so we should 
resolve to keep His name hallowed, 
holy. I hope that the Latter-day 
Saints will remember this and that 
such a thing as taking the name of 



the Lord in vain will never be heard 
from their lips. The words spoken 
by them should be free from all 
things verging on profanity, and 
they should ever feel the greatest 
reverence for the name of the 
Father. 

Next we ask, "Thy kingdom 
come, Thy will be done upon earth 
as it is done in heaven." We should 
seek His kingdom first of all, for its 
possession is far better than riches. 
When we imagine conditions exist- 
ing in heaven, we feel convinced 
that there is no such thing as diso- 
bedience found among the happy 
throngs that dwell there, and this is 
not because they are forced to do 
His will, but because they know it 
is right and most productive of 
happiness. Those who are privileged 
to enter into the presence of the 
Father, and dwell in His kingdom, 
will be such that have gone through 
a probation, and have been tried and 
found true, that have seen the con- 
sequences of sin and disobedience 
and who have chosen and firmly re- 
solved to serve the Lord and keep 
His commandments. They are those 
that have proved themselves able to 
keep such a resolution, so that when 
they go into those blissful regions 
they feel that what the Father wants 
is for their own good, and hence it 
is their choice and delight that His 
will be done there. We should 
use our influence that His will may 
be done here on earth as it is done 
in heaven. We should use our free 
agency to serve the Lord and always 
choose to do His will ; it will bring 
us the greatest happiness. There is 
no true happiness that can come to 
a person who violates the command- 
ments of God, because those com- 
mandments were given for the bless- 
ing of the human race. Every com- 
mandment given by the Lord has a

tendency to do good to them who 
will obey it, and those who will not 
obey His commandments will reap 
the consequences. His command- 
ments to His children are not arbi- 
trary like those of a tyrant, but they 
are measured for the benefit and 
blessing of all who live upon earth. 
So we can heartily pray also that 
His will may be done here upon the 
earth as it is done in heaven. 

We are taught in that prayer to 
ask for our daily bread,showing that 
it is not only for spiritual things we 
dare ask our Father, but also for the 
temporal things that we need as 
well, and in daily bread, of course, is 
included all our interests. We need 
not fear to come before Him and 
ask for success in our business, as 
well as to ask for spiritual blessings. 

We are taught in the prayer to 
ask the Lord to forgive us our debts 
as we are willing to forgive our 
debtors. How much there is in- 
cluded in this ! How this would 
tend toward peace if we were will- 
ing to forgive one another, if we 
could eradicate from our hearts 
every tendency to hatred and bitter- 
ness. We have no right to hate our 
brother. We are asked even to love 
our enemies — a hard thing to do, no 
doubt, but Jesus showed us the ex- 
ample. When hanging upon the 
cross and suffering exquisite tor- 
ture, the most painful that the Ro- 
mans could invent, He could still 
say, "Father, forgive them, for they 
know not what they do." Shall we 
not follow His example? Let us 
have peace, with one another. Let 
us not go to law with our breth- 
ren. Let us not take revenge for 
wrongs done to us, but try to be 
reconciled with those who have any- 
thing against us ; and, if we have 
anything against our brother, let us 
remember the instruction in this 



beautiful prayer, that as we hope to 
be forgiven by our heavenly Father, 
to whom we owe so much, we must 
forgive one another. 

We are also taught here to ask 
"Lead us not into temptation," or. 
as it is given in the French Bible, 
"Abandon us not," or "leave us not 
in temptation." If we know that we 
are weak, brethren and sisters, in 
anything, let us avoid to go where 
there is temptation of the kind that 
may be hard to resist, and we be 
tempted to do that which is not 
right. Remember that it is to him 
who overcomes that the choicest 
promises are made. When we pray 
the Lord not to allow us to be led 
into temptation, let us make the firm 
resolution not to indulge in sinful 
thoughts, and shun evil associations 
and all places where we are in dan- 
ger of temptation, and then the 
Lord will help us to overcome every 
evil tendency. 

The prayer closes with these 
beautiful words of adoration and 
praise, "For thine is the kingdom, 
the power and the glory forever." 
Let us look upon this prayer as 
teaching us true worship. We come 
together to worship the Lord both 
in prayer,- in preaching, in praising 
the Lord, and in singing inspired 
hymns. We do adore Him who is 
our Creator and our Father. We 
know He is all-good, all-wise and 
all-powerful, and worthy of all 
praise, and we rejoice in the prom- 
ise given us that He will hear and 
answer our prayers. 

I see the time is going. I feel very 
much concerned and sad when I 
look upon the condition of the war- 
ring nations. Although we have 
looked forward to a time when war 
shall be poured out upon all nations, 
still when it comes we feel to ask 
that that day might be postponed.

and peace come unto afflicted hu- 
manity. When we think of Europe 
two months ago — of the busy fac- 
tories in Belgium and Germany and 
France, and the busy husbandmen 
in Russia, and other countries that 
are now afflicted with war, and then 
today see millions of men engaged 
in the fiercest and bloodiest of bat- 
tles related in history, we are 
shocked at the terrible carnage, and 
the misery of the widows and the 
orphans that are made daily. Our 
hearts go out to them in the deep- 
est sympathy, and we feel to take 
part in a prayer like that which was 
offered by Brother Penrose, that 
the Lord will be merciful unto them. 

May the day hasten when peace 
shall reign upon the earth, when 
Christ shall come and reign, and the 
thousand years of peace be intro- 
duced, and the announcement of the 
angels shall indeed be fulfilled. 
"Peace on earth and good will to 
men," I ask that we may be pre- 
pared for this, and that the Lord 
may bless the Latter-day Saints, and 
bless the leaders of this nation, that 
they may avoid all foreign entangle- 
ments, and that peace may continue 
to reign in this land, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Smith stated that an- 
other overflow meeting will be held 
in the Assembly Hall, at 2 p. m., at 
which Elder Joseph F. Smith, Jr., 
will preside. He also announced that 
arrangements have been made, by 
the Presiding Bishopric, to furnish 
accommodations to Conference 
visitors who are not otherwise pro- 
vided for. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Oh 
come, let us sing, let us sing unto 
the Lord." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Samuel O. Bennion. 



Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m. The services wre presided 
over by Elder George F. Richards, 
and the Emerson Ward choir fur- 
nished the music. 

The Choir sang the hymn : 

Lo ! the mighty God appearing, 
From on high Jehovah speaks ! 

Eastern lands the summons hearing, 
O'er the we t His thunder breaks. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Charles A. Callis. 

The Choir sang the anthem, 
"Trust ye in Jehovah." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Unity of the Saints in prayer for peace 
— Inspiring effect of knowledge that 
we are God's children — The mission 
of Jesus, our Elder Brother — En- 
couragement to subject ourselves to 
Gospel laws — Faith increased by 
studying Scriptures — Advantages of 
obedience to every principle of truth. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
inasmuch as I have received the ap- 
pointment, by the President of the 
Church ,to preside at this overflow 
meeting, I desire to extend to you 
a cordial welcome to the conference, 
and express, in behalf of the Presi- 
dency, their and our appreciation of 
the presence of so many of you in 
this, the opening session, of our 
semi-annual conference. I realize 
that it is somewhat of a disappoint- 
ment to our brethren and sisters 
not to be able to find places in the 
large Tabernacle this morning, but I

am sure that if we can compose our 
minds and feel, above all else, a de- 
sire to acceptably worship the Lord 
in our meeting here this morning, 
that His spirit will be poured out 
upon us, and we will have occasion 
to rejoice before Him, in the knowl- 
edge of the Gospel which He has 
given unto us, and the testimony 
which we have received of its truth. 
I appreciate, with you, the beautiful 
singing of the Emerson Ward Choir 
this morning, and feel thankful for 
their services. 

I endorse, with all my heart, the 
sentiments of the opening prayer of- 
fered by President Charles A.Callis, 
president of the Southern States 
mission. I believe in the scripture 
which says that the prayer of a 
righteous man availeth much, and I 
believe that where many righteous 
men and women are met together to 
worship the Lord, and have brought 
their minds to a singleness and com- 
munity of faith and interest, and lift 
their voices in prayer, that the Lord 
will hear the prayer. This is my 
faith, my trust and confidence, and 
T trust that that which is our will 
concerning the troubled nations of 
the earth today, that peace may ob- 
tain, that bloodshed may discon- 
tinue, and that those who have oc- 
casion to sorrow and mourn be- 
cause of the wars which are in the 
earth today may be comforted of 
the Lord; I trust that this will be 
the mind and will of the Lord, and 
that He can, consistently with His 
will and purposes, answer our 
prayers this day. I remember that 
there will be thousands of earnest 
prayers, this day, offered to the 
Lord in behalf of the troubled na- 
tions and the people who are in 
mourning and sorrow. 

I rejoice with you, my brethren 
and sisters, this morning, in the 



Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
never had a stronger testimony of 
the truth than I have today. There 
is scarcely room for doubt in my 
mind — I think there is no doubt — 
in regard to the truth of all of the 
principles of the Gospel as they are 
taught today by the Latter-day 
Saints. It is the Gospel which was 
instituted, as the scriptures tell us 
very clearly, from the foundations 
of the world, a plan for the exist- 
ence of man and of the earth, of 
their fall, their redemption and their 
glorification, a Gospel which is to 
be taught unto the world of man- 
kind as the justice and mercy of 
God demands, to the living and the 
dead, a law by which all shall be 
judged, a savior of life unto life or 
of death unto death to those who re- 
ceive it, who are faithful in the 
keeping of the commandments or to 
those who reject and fight against it. 

I rejoice in the testimony which I 
bear this morning that God, the 
eternal Father, lives, an immortal 
and glorified being, whose power 
has no limitations. He is the Cre- 
ator of the heavens and earth and 
the seas, and of all things that are 
therein, as the scriptures affirm, and 
they are His ; the earth is the Lord's 
and the fulness thereof. He is the 
very eternal Father of the spirits of 
men, for we all had a spiritual birth, 
a spiritual existence and experience 
and we were born of God. Think of 
it, brethren and sisters, sons and 
daughters of God inheriting from 
Him through our spiritual birth the 
very attributes and qualities of De- 
ity, which in our Father in heaven 
are pefect and make Him what He 
is. We are placed here upon the 
earth for the purpose, in part, of im- 
proving, magnifying and perfecting 
those qualities and attributes; so 
that, while we are now but gods in

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



embryo, having been born of God, 
in His likeness, in His image, and 
having received from Him the at- 
tributes of Deity, through perfect- 
ing those attributes in time and in 
eternity we will be like Him in very 
deed, and be glorified with him in 
His kingdom. 

I rejoice in the testimony that I 
have, and cheerfully bear to you to- 
day, that Jesus Christ is the Savior 
of the world, the Messiah which was 
predicted should come in. the mer- 
idian of time to redeem mankind 
from the effects of the transgres- 
sion of our first parents, or the fall 
of man, and also to redeem us from 
the effects of our individual sins, on 
condition of our acceptance of His 
atoneme'nt and His laws, and the or- 
dinances of the everlasting Gospel. 
Jesus lives. He has passed through 
the experiences of a life here upon 
the earth. He was true and' faithful 
in the beginning, in contradistinc- 
tion to that other great spirit who 
fell away, who was rejected of the 
Lord, who was driven forth from 
heaven, and with him many of the 
sons and daughters of God. Jesus 
stood for the principle, "Thy will be 
done," and "The glory be thine for- 
ever;" the righteous exercise of 
agency as our Father would have us 
all to be, wise and righteous in the 
exercise of our agency. When He 
came upon the earth He was still 
true to the covenant which He made 
with the Father, and uppermost in 
His mind, and in all His life's work 
was that thought, "Father, Thy will 
be done and the glory be Thine for- 
ever." He was the great prototype 
and exemplar of mankind, our ex- 
emplar, brethren and sisters and 
friends, He leads the way, and every 
path defines, as we sing in one of 
our hymns that we, His followers, 
His brothers and sisters, are re- 



quired to walk in in order that we 
may, when we have passed through 
this life,_ go to the glory beyond ; 
and, as He took up His body, we 
may take up our bodies again and 
go on, as He has gone, to eternal 
exaltation ; and as He sits at the 
right hand of God, the eternal Fath- 
er, in His celestial kingdom, an heir 
to all that our heavenly Father pos- 
sesses ; that we, by following in His 
steps, may become joint heirs with 
Him in all things. This is my tes- 
timony to you in regard to Jesus 
Christ, our Savior, His life and 
ministry, in brief. 

.1 rejoice in the knowledge which 
has come to me through the study 
of the scriptures, a knowledge and 
assurance of the immortality of the 
soul, life beyond the grave. Oh, 
what a joy! What a joy to those 
who have this hope, and are making 
preparation according to the best 
light they have to meet the condi- 
tions beyond this life. I am thank- 
ful for the knowledge which the 
Gospel gives me, that the conditions 
of life beyond the grave depend up- 
on the lives we live while we are 
here in mortality. I thank the Lord 
for the influence of this knowledge, 
the influence of the Gospel restrain- 
ing me from doing those things 
which would exempt me from the 
enjoyment of those blessings which 
are in store for the faithful. I am 
thankful, also, for the stimulating 
and encouraging influence of the 
Gospel upon my life, encouraging 
me to make the sacrifices that are 
necessary to be made to do the 
things which may be -required of me 
in order that I may not fall short of 
those blessings. 

However, I cannot boast. I ac- 
knowledge before the Lord and my 
brethren and sisters, my weakness 
and my imperfections, and my de-

pendence upon the Lord for 
strength and power day by day to 
live the law which He has revealed. 
But I have assurance of the neces- 
sity for living by that law, that sal- 
vation and eternal life can be ob- 
tained through obedience unto the 
laws and commandments of God. 

I think that the lack of faith on 
the part of many people in the 
Church, and out of the Church, is 
due to the fact that they have not 
given clue attention to these things. 
I understand that faith comes by 
hearing, for so the scriptures teach. 
Or, in other words, as I would in- 
terpret it, faith comes by investiga- 
tion. We have the scriptures, an- 
cient and modern, which are the 
revelations of the Lord unto His 
servants the prophets in different 
Gospel dispensations. They have 
been preserved and have been de- 
livered unto us for our guidance, 
with a commandment from the Lord 
that we search the scriptures, "for 
in them ye think ye have eternal life, 
and they are they which testify of 
me." They do testify of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost, of the great plan of life and 
salvation, the life beyond the grave ; 
and a study of these things causes 
the mind to reflect upon them, the 
reason to be brought to bear upon 
them, and the conclusion reached by 
the honest-hearted person is usually 
that those things are true, that they 
are just, that they are good for man. 
And still some have need for teach- 
ers, which was so with the eunuch., 
as you remember. He was reading 
the scriptures, but he did not under- 
stand them. It took a Phillip, in- 
spired of the Lord, learned in the 
scriptures, to explain them to his 
understanding. But when he saw 
the truth, and being honest in his 
heart, he was willing to obey it. 



I invite the Latter-day Saints to 
read the scriptures more than they 
do, for while the Latter-day Saints 
have a measure of faith, which is a 
gift of God, until we shall reach the 
perfect life, the high standard which 
was set for us by our Savior, we 
still have need of faith ; and if inves- 
tigation is going to give us faith, we 
need to investigate, we need to study 
we need to pray, and it is just as 
true that if we would receive the 
witness of the Spirit of God, we 
must obey and act, we must receive 
those things which are offered unto 
us. We must, when we receive faith 
to believe in these principles that 
they are true, we must have the* 
fortitude, the • courage to accept 
those truths, and putting our trust 
in the Lord, acknowledge Him, and 
make our lives conform therewith. 
Happiness in the life of the Latter- 
day Saint consists in the conscious- 
ness of having lived closely to the 
law of the Lord. He who has em- 
braced the Gospel, who has had a 
witness of its truth, and then only 
half lived the law is constantly un- 
der self-condemnation. It robs him 
of the joy, of the peace, yes, and of 
the hope of eternal life, that it is 
intended true Latter-day Saints 
should enjoy. 

I admonish the Saints, if they 
would be happy, and if they would 
have an assurance that it would be 
well with them beyond the grave, 
that we be more faithful in the keep- 
ing of the commandments of the 
Lord. • Who is there that can say in 
truth that 'Mormonism," so-called, 
is not true, is not good for man ? I 
will make the declaration to you, 
my brethren and sisters and friends, 
that that which is good for man is 
true, and the Gospel is good. Are 
we not taught, in fact it is an article 
of our faith, the thirteenth article: 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"We believe in being honest, true : 
chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in 
doing good to all men. We believe 
all things, we hope all things, we 
have endured many things, and we 
hope to be able to endure all things. 
If there is anything virtuous, lovely 
or of good report, or praiseworthy 
we seek after these things." The 
Gospel teaches us that as children 
of our Father in heaven, we have 
the same attributes which He pos- 
sesses, such as justice, judgment, 
mercy, truth, love and other quali- 
ties, and the requirement is that we 
labor with ourselves constantly to 
perfect these attributes. Would not 
that be good for any man, for all 
men? I believe firmly that that is 
what Jesus meant when He said, as 
recorded in the fifth chapter of Mat- 
thew : "Be ye perfect even as your 
Father which is in heaven is per- 
fect." Now, is not that good for 
us ? Is it not good for every man to 
be just in judgment, to be virtuous, 
to be pure ? Yes, and we are to add 
to our faith, as Peter said: "virtue, 
to virtue knowledge, temperance 
patience, godliness, brotherly kind- 
ness and charity." Are not these 
things good? They are included in 
the Gospel. But I fancy I hear 
some individual say, "Well, that is 
all right. We believe in these things 
outside of the Church. They are 
good for man ; we will admit that ; 
but these ordinances and the neces- 
sity for faith in God we do not un- 
derstand." Now, there is a class 
who do not believe that there is a 
God, a Creator of all things, and 
who do not believe that there is a 
life beyond the grave. It is an un- 
fortunate condition. If there is a 
God and a life beyond the grave 
there will come a time when that 
fact will be known. Now, if it shall 
prove that there is a God, and a life 



beyond the grave, and that faith in 
Him is necessary to salvation, as the 
scriptures teach, how much better 
off will those be who have had that 
faith than those who have rejected 
it. And if it were possible that we 
were mistaken, we would still be as 
well off as the atheist and better off 
than we would have been without 
this faith, for it is helpful to make 
us better men and women than we 
otherwise would have been. 

But faith is not all that is neces- 
sary, and yet there are some who 
hold that faith is all that is neces- 
sary. But the Latter-day Saints be- 
lieve the scriptures which teach that 
there are certain ordinances which 
must be complied with in order to 
obtain salvation. Now, then, if it 
shall prove that these things are 
true, as they are scriptural, how dis- 
appointed then will be those who. 
not having believed in these things, 
have not yielded obedience to them, 
and therefore have not made the 
necessary preparation for the life 
beyond the grave? While those of 
us who have believed, and believing 
the scriptures, have yielded obedi- 
ence, find ourselves in the favor of 
God, in the way of salvation. You 
see that that which we have accept- 
ed is on the oositive side of these re- 
ligious questions, and not the neg- 
ative ; and if they prove true, we 
are on the safe side, but if it were 
possible that they should be other- 
wise, we would still be as well off as 
those who reject these things. 

So we may take each of the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. You may take 
also that very important principle 
eternity of the marriage covenant. 
We believe in the scriptures which 
teach that "neither is the man with- 
out the woman, neither the woman 
without the man in the Lord," and 
in that scripture which teaches that

power and authority was given to 
men upon the eearth — Jesus con- 
ferred it Himself upon Peter and his 
associates, power to bind on earth 
and it should be bound or sealed in 
heaven, to loose on earth, and it 
should be loosed in heaven. In this 
day He has revealed anew the Gos- 
pel, and this power and authority, 
and a knowledge of the ordinance 
of marriage, with instructions to 
build temples that we may enter 
therein and solemnize marriages in ' 
the way that He has ordained, and 
as will be effective beyond this life. 
The Latter-day Saints have accepted 
these principles, amply sustained 
by the New Testament and modern 
revelation also. If it shall prove 
that we are correct, Latter-day 
Saints, then those who have re- 
jected this principle will be at a 
serious loss and will suffer a great 
disappointment. How much better, 
then, to accept the safe way, to be 
on the safe side ? That is where the 
Latter-day Saints stand. There can 
be no disappointment on their part, 
if they are true to that which they 
have accepted. 

We may say the same in regard 
to our dead. We believe, for the 
scriptures teach it, that the gospel 
must be preached to the dead, and is 
being preached to the dead. "For 
this cause is the Gospel preached to 
the dead [says the Apostle Peter], 
that they might be judged ac- 
cording- to men in the flesh and live 
according to God in the spirit. 
Not only that but the work 
which is necessary for the liv- 
ing, the identical ordinances which 
we have accepted as Latter-day 
Saints are necessary for our dead, 
and we are called to be saviors upon 
Mount Zion for them, that through 
the atonement of our Savior and 
the work that Ave do for them, a vi- 



carious work, by their acceptance 
of it when the time comes that they 
shall be prepared to accept of it, that 
work becomes effective for them 
and for their salvation. How much 
better off we will be, having accom- 
plished this great work for our 
dead, if it proves true, as it is scrip- 
tural, and necessary for the salva- 
tion of our dead, and for our own 
salvation and glory, for we are told 
in the scripture — Paul expressly 
states — that we cannot be perfect 
without our dead. How much bet- 
ter off are those who receive than 
those who reject these principles? 
Are we not on the safe side? Are 
not these things good, brethren and 
sisters? They have inspired us to 
be more helpful, to look to the hap- 
piness of others, to serve our God 
by serving our fellow men, the liv- 
ing and the dead. That is what the 
Gospel teaches, the Gospel which 
the Latter-day Saints have re- 
ceived. 

You have occasion to rejoice. 
There is nothing offered in the 
world that can be a substitute, that 
will be satisfying to you ; and be- 
cause this is true, the Latter-day 
Saints are not being converted to 
other religious doctrines. Conver- 
sion of the Saints to other creeds is 
almost unknown, although we have 
preachers among us. Our elders 
who go into the world and preach 
the Gospel among the people, min- 
gle with learned men who are rep- 
resentatives of other denomina- 
tions, and yet they are not convinced 
or converted, either of the error of 
that which they have received or of 
the truth and superiority of that 
which the religions of the world 
have to offer. We are making con- 
verts here by thousands right here 
among us, in our cities and wards, 
and in the mission fields abroad ; be-

cause these ordinances, as well as 
the truths that we have been speak- 
ing of, appeal to them as being rea- 
sonable, good for man, and they 
want to be on the safe side. 

I bear you my testimony, my 
brethren and sisters, that I know 
the Gospel is true, and know that it 
is indeed the power of God unto 
happiness and joy in this life, and 
salvation and exaltation in the 
world to come. I admonish you 
with great earnestness, my brethren 
and sisters, that you try, for your 
own sakes and for the sake of your 
children, and your children's chil- 
dren, and those who come within 
our gates, to be diligent and faith- 
ful in living up to the perfect law 
of God, which has been given for 
cur guidance here and our eternal 
salvation. 

May the Lord bless all Israel to 
this end, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Heavenly Father." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the opportunity afforded me of 
meeting with the Latter-day Saints 
in our annual and semi-annual con- 
ferences. I recognize in the lives of 
the Latter-day Saints, who are 
looked upon as being a peculiar and 
choice people of the Lord, that there 
is not the ordinariness that is usu- 
ally found in professing Christians 
in the world. I rejoice in knowing 
that my parents had the courage 
and fortitude of character to leave 
the old country and come unto this 
goodly land as Pioneers, where they 
could raise their family in the air 



of freedom and religious liberty. I 
rejoice in being made partaker of 
the numerous blessings of the New 
and Everlasting Covenant, the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, as partly en- 
numerated by Elder Richards this 
morning. 

I have a firm and abidng testi- 
mony in the truth of the message 
which we bear to the world. My 
heart is made glad on this occasion 
by having the opportunity of bear- 
• ing my humble testimony before my 
brethren and sisters, that I know 
God lives, and that Jesus is the 
Christ. I thank the Lord that this 
Church was not born out of the 
division and dissension which has 
been prevalent in the man-made re- 
ligions, but that it has been born of 
God, and is sanctioned by Him. 

When I spoke here, six month.-, 
ago, I referred to the passage of 
scripture found in the second chap- 
ter of I Peter, wherein it says that 
"Ye are a peculiar people, a chosen 
generation, and a royal priesthood," 
and said that I rejoiced in the truth 
of that passage of scripture as ap- 
plying to the Latter-day Saints. 
When I returned to New York, 1 
found published, in the Christian 
Statesman, a most scurrilous article 
with respect to the Latter-day 
Saints, making ridicule of this state- 
ment quoted from the writings of 
St. Peter, who stood close to the 
Master in his life's mission. If the 
Latter-day Saints are not that pe- 
culiar people, where will you find 
them? Where is that peculiar peo- 
ple, that chosen generation, that 
royal Priesthood? 

It seems hardly necessary for the 
President of the United States to 
suggest to Latter-day Saints that 
this day be devoted to prayers for 
peace, because it has ever been the 
burden of our message to the world, 



ELDER WALTER P. M ON SON. 



21 



a message of harmony, peace and 
salvation. We teach that brother 
should cease to contend with 
brother; and hold out our arms 
in love to all mankind. Amidst per- 
secution and tribulation, we have 
asked the people of the world to bow 
at the shrine of Jesus Christ, who 
loved the world's inhabitants with 
that wondrous maganimity which 
impelled Him to give His life that 
we might live. Nineteen long, war- 
scarred centuries have passed since 
the humble shepherds upon the 
plains of Judea, watching their 
flocks by night, heard the most glor- 
ious of anthems sang by an angelic 
choir. This was called to my mind 
listening to the last anthem so beau- 
tifully rendered by the Emerson 
Ward choir. The angels sang, 
"Glory to God in the highest, and 
on earth peace good will toward 
men ;" and for nineteen centuries 
Christians have been singing this 
song. But. when we look over the 
Christian world, today, we see prac- 
tically two-thirds of those who are 
professed followers of Christ, en- 
gaging in deadly conflict with each 
other, in quest of power, authority 
and dominion. And so it seems a 
travesty upon Christianity, to pro- 
fess peace and engage in war. We 
find some of those people, who pray 
for peace have, stood in pulpits, in 
sacerdotal robes, and stated that 
" 'Mormonism' is a menace to this 
nation and the Christian world, un- 
less we can conquer its adherents by 
means of legislative enactment, we 
will feel called upon to unsheath 
our swords and exterminate them." 
Yet they pray for peace! I won- 
der how long, O Lord, it will be be- 
fore all of the Christian world will 
realize that the. teachings of the 
gospel of peace are meant not only 



to be a beautiful sentiment but also 
to be put in effect ? 

We are a peculiar people, differ- 
entiated from other religious de- 
nominations in the world, and I 
thank God most sincerely for the 
difference. God has raised up this 
people for a most important and 
glorious work. It is our special 
duty to carry the message of life and 
peace to the world. Where there 
is strife between father and son, we 
are to manifest the spirit and power 
of the Priesthood of Elijah, the 
Prophet, in that "the hearts of the 
fathers should be turned unto the 
children, and the hearts of the chil- 
dren unto the fathers." It is our 
good pleasure to take the message 
of divine peace unto those who are 
not in the enjoyment of that bless- 
ing. 

There is a power with the Latter- 
day Saints that the world does not 
perceive. It is that spirit which 
Jesus, when among His disciples 
upon the earth, said was necessary 
to come. He declared "it is ex- 
pedient for you that I go away, for 
if I go not away the Comforter will 
not come unto you ; but if I depart 
I will send him unto you." 

I remember that, when I was a 
child, attending the Primary organ- 
ization in my home town, the good 
sisters taught us children the beau- 
tiful song: 

"I think when I read that sweet story 
of old. 

When Jesus was here among men, 
How He called little children, as lambs, 

to His fold. 
I should like to have been with Him 

then; 

I wish that His hand had been placed on 
my head, 

And His arm had been thrown about 
me, 

That I might receive His kind look 
when He said, 
'Let the little ones come unto Me.' " 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



O how I used to repoiee in the 
sentiment of that song. But, by 
long experience in the service of the 
Lord, and by the whisperings of that 
still sweet spirit unto my soul, I am 
not sure that I would have been 
more happy had I lived in the days 
of the Savior than I am today. The 
Savior said that it was expedient He 
should go away. Wherein lies the 
expediency? Is there any example 
that would confirm that statement in 
the hearts of the children of men? 
Let us see. St. Peter, who was so 
closely associated with the Master in 
his ministry, was so very impetuous 
in his nature that he even rebuked 
the Savior, when the Savior showed 
him that He would die at the hands 
of wicked men. Peter said "Be it 
far from Thee, Lord ; this shall not 
be unto Thee," and indicated his 
determination to defend the Master. 
The Savior rebuked him, and said: 
"Get thee behind Me, Satan, for 
thou savourest not the things that 
be of God but those that be of men." 
Peter, boasting of his implicit faith, 
in his impetuosity would have gone 
still further, but the Savior warned 
him. Said he : "Verily I say unto 
thee, that this night before the cock 
shall crow, thou shalt deny Me 
thrice." When the Savior was taken 
b|y wicked men and beaten with 
staves, a scarlet robe put upon Him 
in mockery of His authority, and a 
crown of plaited thorns was put 
upon His head, when he was spat 
jtipon, and all manner of indignities 
heaped upon him, Peter still loving 
the Savior, followed Him to the in- 
ner court where the Jews were heap- 
ing these indignities upon Him. As 
Peter skulked in the shadow of the 
wall, a little maid pointed her finger, 
and said : "Here is one that was 
with Him." Peter said, "You are 
mistaken ; I knew Him not." At the 



third accusation he even cursed and 
swore, and said he knew not the 
Master. Then the cock crew, and 
Peter went out and wept bitterly. 

I am not sure that I would have 
been any stronger than St. Peter in 
that trying moment, unless there 
were some power given, such as 
came upon the great congregation 
that assembled on the day of Pente- 
cost, when the spirit came like 
cloven tongues of fire and rested 
upon the disciples who had gathered 
together. After Peter had preached 
that most memorable discourse, 
proving to the Jews that they had 
crucified the Lord of glory, they 
rose with one accord and said, "Men 
and brethren, what shall we do?" 
Then Peter, in the authority of his 
calling, stepped forward and in the 
dignity of his leadership in the 
Church, said : "Repent and be bap- 
tized, every one of you, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, for the remission of 
your sins, and ye shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, for this 
promise is unto you and your chil- 
dren, and those that are afar off, 
even as many as the Lord our God 
shall call." O, what a glorious 
promise is given unto us, even 
though we are far removed in 
time and distance from this event 
which happened on that day of 
Pentecost! Do you, find any other 
time in the life of St. Peter when 
he ever denied the Master? Then, 
was it not expedient for the disciples 
that He should go away, that the 
"spirit which the world cannot re- 
ceive," might come upon the faith- 
ful followers of the meek and lowly 
Nazarine, which would give them 
sustaining power by which they 
could face men and devils, and de- 
clare that Jesus was the Christ, the 
Savior of the world? Therefore, I 
say that we have 'received an anoint- 



ELDER WALTER P. M ON SON. 



23 



ing that maketh us that no man 
need teach us what we should say, 
for that anointing will inspire us to 
teach in the same hour what we 
ought to say. I feel much pity and 
sorrow for an individual who, in 
life, has parted company with the 
influence that is conferred upon men 
by that Spirit by which we draw 
nigh unto God and learn of Him and 
His Son, Jesus Christ. It is the 
revealing power of God that calmly 
speaks unto the human heart, and 
awakens noble sentiments by which 
man may correct any evil tendencies 
of his life. 

I remember, when I was going to 
England on a mission, about five 
years ago, I was very much inter- 
ested in the sound of the wireless in- 
strument on board the good ship 
Dominion. It had a peculiar crack- 
ling sound; I cannot just describe 
it. I introduced myself to the oper- 
ator, and asked him if - he would 
mind my being in the room while he 
was receiving a message. He re- 
plied, "Not at all, come in my 
friend." After he had received a 
message, he took a chamois skin and 
wiped off a little dust, showing that 
he regarded the instrument as very 
precious. I said, "You seem to pay 
a great deal of care and attention to 
this instrument." . He said, "Indeed, 
it is absolutely necessary; if a bit 
of dust or lint should get on this in- 
strument it might be thrown out of 
tune. Should we strike a reef, we 
would be unable to send out our 
message of distress to some ship for 
help, that might be near, yet out of 
sight; or we might be upon the 
water, and not be in a position to 
receive a message, by reason of be- 
ing out of atunement with other 
wireless instruments on the At- 
lantic." I went away thinking what 
a glorious lesson I have learned. 



There is a wireless instrument with- 
in us ; a principle by which we re- 
ceive messages from our heavenly 
Father for our guidance, for our 
comfort and safety. I wonder if 
we keep our wireless instruments 
clean and polished. And there I 
made a firm resolve, and repeated it 
aloud, "I would rather lose my life 
than have my spiritual wireless be- 
come soiled and injured." I trust 
that a similar resolve is incorpor- 
ated in the prayer of all Latter-day 
Saints, that they may always keep 
themselves in harmony with that 
Spirit which leads in the true path, 
and which says, "This is the way, 
walk ye in it;" that the wireless in- 
struments of our souls may be kept 
so clean and pure, and in such per- 
fect attunement with the refined in- 
fluences of the Spirit of God, that 
we may be said to be in accord with 
it, and derive the invaluable and 
life-giving influences that flow from 
it for our guidance, our comfort 
and our everlasting good. 

There comes to my mind a pass- 
age of scripture, found in the 68th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and I often turn to this pass- 
age and read it to the elders who 

1 • • • 1 
labor under my direction in the 

Eastern States, and I think it is a 
splendid thing for the Priesthood 
at home also to read it occasionally, 
because in it there is comforting 
power that makes you feel that you 
are among the chosen people of the 
Lord : 

"My servant Orson Hyde was called 
by his ordinance to proclaim the ever- 
lasting Gospel by the Spirit of the 
living God, from people to people, and 
from land to land, in the congrega- 
tions of the wicked, in their syna- 
gogues, reasoning with and explain- 
ing all scripture unto them. ; And 
behold and lo, this is an ensample 
unto all those who are ordained unto

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this Priesthood, whose mission is ap- 
pointed unto them, to go forth; and 
this it an ensample unto them, that 
they shall speak as they are moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, and whatso- 
ever they shall speak when moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost shall be 
scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, 
shall be the mind of the Lord, shall 
be the word of the Lord, shall be the 
voice of the Lord, and the power of 
God unto salvaton: behold, this is the 
promise of the Lord unto you, O ye 
my servants; wherefore be of good 
cheer, and do not fear, for behold, I 
the Lord am with you, and will stand 
by you; and ye shall bear record of 
Me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the 
Son of the living God, that I was, 
that I am, and that I am to come. 
This is the word of the Lord unto 
you my servant, Orson Hyde, and also 
unto My servant Luke Johnson, and 
unto My servant Lyman Johnson 
unto My servant William E. Mc'Lel- 
lan, and unto all the faithful Elders 
of My Church." 

Then, we have reason to trust 
the power that God has promised 
unto us ; if we will depend upon 
Him for the truth, or for the utter- 
ance of truth. He will not desert us, 
but will teach us in the same hour 
what we shall say. I fear that some- 
times we are following- the example 
of the world, that we are preparing 
our sermons ahead of time, instead 
of turning a prayerful heart and 
mind unto our heavenly Father, ask- 
ing Him to indite the words that we 
might utter, that the humble prayer 
of some individual who may hear 
might be answered, as though our 
words were flowing from the lips of 
the Lord Himself. Is there not a 
point of differentiation with the 
world in this? 

There comes to my mind a cir- 
cumstance that happened; within the 
last six months, in the Eastern 
States mission, where some of your 
sons, or husbands, perhaps, may be 
laboring. The scripture just read 
says, "Wherefore, be of good cheer, 



and do not fear, for I, the Lord, am 
with you." Two humble Elders 
were traveling in the country dur- 
ing the month of July, and there 
were people trying to circumvent 
our influence and the progress of the 
Church there, saying all manner of 
evil against us falsely. These two 
Elders, one night, about ten o'clock, 
were seeking some kind hearted 
Christian who would shelter them 
for the night. There was a lady en- 
gaged on the lecture platform, going 
from city to city, in that section, 
warning the people against the 
preaching of the "Mormon" Elders. 
These two young men from Utah, 
unwittingly, called at the house 
where this lady was staying, and 
asked for entertainment. The man 
of the house met them, and, turning 
to those within the house, he said: 
"Here are two 'Mormon' Elders 
now ; speak of the devil and he is 
close by." His wfe said, "Call them 
in, I would like to look at a 'Mor- 
mon,' " and he called them in. The 
woman lecturer said to them, "I am 
out on an errand against you. I am 
surprised that you should befoul our 
Christian atmosphere by your pres- 
ence, and now I wanted to have a 
look at you." After she had looked 
at them for a moment, she went out 
of the room, suspiciously satisfied. 
They were then told they could not 
remain, but were called in only as 
objects of scorn. One of the Elders 
said : "My good friend, we are very 
tired, we have traveled all day with- 
out dinner or supper, we feel that 
we can't go any further. Do you 
have any objections to our sleeping 
in your barn tonight?" He said: 
"I suppose there is no objection to 
your going out to sleep in the barn 
where the cattle are, and I will give 
you two quilts." They went out into 
the barn, into a hay mow, and 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON.

spread the quilts. Before retiring 
to rest, the two Elders lifted up their 
voices in .song, singing "Come, 
come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear," including the second verse: 
''Why should we mourn, or think 
our lot is hard? Tis not so, all is 
well," etc. Then they knelt down 
and prayed that the blessing of the 
Lord might be upon the owner of 
the place, that he might always 
hold his property in peace for ad- 
ministering unto the wants of God's 
servants. When they had finished 
praying, they heard some one out- 
side the barn : the man and his wife, 
and the woman who had come to 
lecture against them, had stolen out 
to see what manner of mischief the 
"Mormon" Elders might do, and 
they heard the sermon of their lives, 
with the result that the woman who 
was once so bitterly opposed to us 
is now investigating the Gospel. I 
want to tell you that fidelity to truth 
does not lie within man's" power 
alone, it is the upholding and sus- 
taining power of God that brings a 
realization of divine blessings. 

Another instance: There were 
two Elders laboring in a city in 
Pennsylvania; the parents of one 
of them are not members of the 
Church, he being the only one of 
the family who has accepted the 
Gospel. The two faithful young- 
elders were beginning to hold a 
meeting upon the street, and a sec- 
tarian minister, standing off to one 
side, saw them. He had made his 
threat that they would hold no 
meetings on the streets of that city, 
as long as he breathed the breath of 
life. One of the elders, a mere boy 
of 19 or 20, stepped out and com- 
menced preaching, and the minister, 
who was acting in the double capac- 
ity of spiritual adviser and spy, 
called on a policeman to come and 



arrest the young man. Responding, 
the policeman took the young elder 
by the arm with a vise-like grip. 
The young man silently prayed, "O 
God give me courage that I may not 
cry out for pain." He was taken 
off toward the police station. When 
they had walked through the streets 
about a block and a half, the young 
man, in boyish innocence, looked up 
and said: "I suppose this city is 
thoroughly Christianized." The 
policeman was deeply affected and 
said: "My young ' fellow, I am 
sorry that I have to do this ; I am 
not responsible for this indignity 
that is brought to you." "No," 
said the young man, "you are not 
responsible, but -that minister who 
stood on the sidewalk did not tell 
you to pinch my arm till it is black 
and blue." And he added, as it be- 
came certain that he was going to 
jail, "Is there anyone else in there?" 
"O yes, there are several." The 
youthful "Mormon" missionary 
then said it would be the crowning- 
effort of his mission to have the 
privilege of preaching the Gospel 
to spirits in prison. While the 
policeman was taking this elder to 
jail, his companion, notwithstanding 
his being alone, went out and began 
preaching, and another policeman 
took him to jail. The two elders 
were put in a cell together. After 
they had been there about two 
hours, during which time a consul- 
tation had been held on the outside 
by the officers, an automobile was 
brought, and they were taken to the 
outskirts of the town, where they 
were told that they must never come 
back again. The young man said, 
"My right to liberty is" written on 
the face of the Constitution of the 
United States, which has always 
protected the innocent and held evil 
doers in subjection. I have been 



26

sent by the authority of the Lord to 
deliver His word to the people of 
this town, and I will suit myself 
whether I come back again or not." 
The elders then turned and walked 
back to the city. Now there is a 
glorious prospect in that city of or- 
ganizing and building up a most 
splendid branch of the Church. 

I tell you, when the powers of 
darkness come, while our elders are 
in the line of their duty they stand 
up as giants in spiritual strength 
and endurance. I praise the Lord 
that the third and fourth genera- 
tions of the pioneers of this people 
are valiant, and worthy the names 
which they bear. 

May God bless us with His Holy 
Spirit, that the strengthening and 
consoling power thereof may be dis- 
tilled upon our hearts, that we may 
love each other, that we may ex- 
tend help and sympathy to those 
who have made mistakes in life, and 
helpful forgiveness to all mankind. 
I praise the Lord that Lie has plant- 
ed in our hearts the desire for that 
peace about which the angelic choir 
sang. May God bless us with His 
Holy Spirit always, that we may 
realize the true position which we 
hold in the world, and ever, with 
the strength and fortitude that 
comes from the power of the Al- 
mighty, be willing to proclaim to 
the world that God really has 
spoken from the heavens, and that 
we are truly His ambassadors ; 
which may God grant unto us all, I 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 

Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Oh, 
Light Eternal." 

Benediction was pronounced, by 
Elder Willard L. Jones. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order, and stated 
that, in addition to the overflow 
meeting in the Assembly Hall this 
afternoon, an open air meeting will 
be held in front of the Bureau of 
Information, to be conducted Iby 
Elder Benjamin Goddard. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
hymn : 

Ye simple souls who stray 
Far from the path of peace, 

That lonely, unfrequented way 
To life and happiness. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Solomon Hale. 

.The anthem, ''Grant us Peace," 
was sung by the choir, Mrs. Sarah 
L. Wood and James Moncar ren- 
dering the duet. 

PREST. FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Latter-day Saints generally a prayer- 
ful people — Constant prayer and 
thanksgiving due to Him by whom 
we exist — Seventies should always 
be engaged in their special calling- 
Priesthood and people should con- 
stantly minister for each other's 
welfare — Abundant opportunities 
for missionary work at home — To 
please God, compliance with Gospel 
ordinances essential. 

I presume you were all here this 
morning, and that you realize how 
good the Lord was to us in inspir- 
ing the brethren who spoke to us, 
and I trust the same good spirit will 
be with those who speak to the great 
multitude of people this afternoon 
in this and the other gatherings on 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

this square. If you will do your 
best to hear, I will do my best to 
make you hear. 

It seems to me as though the 
Lord was smiling upon His people, 
the Latter-day Saints, and upon all 
people who are in the land of Zion, 
on this side of the world,- where we 
are fairly favored with peace; yet 
we want a little more of it, so that 
we will have peace altogether. 

On this special day of prayer, it 
is not very trying on the Latter-day 
Saints to be asked to appear before 
the Lord in prayer, because we are 
a prayerful people. All Latter-day 
Saints pray. They pray in the 
morning, they pray in the evening; 
they pray secretly and they pray in 
their families. We pray in our 
meetings of worship in opening and 
in closing the services-; and on spe- 
cial occasions, such as today, we 
pray for special blessings, to be in 
harmony with the people of our na- 
tion, and also in harmony with the 
direction and counsel of our file 
leaders. But, we pray always for 
peace, and for every other blessing 
that we require. When I listened 
to the brethren this morning preach- 
ing upon prayer, and to the prayer 
by President Penrose, I was re- 
minded of a few words of the 
Savior that He delivered to the 
Nephites, after His resurrection, 
when He came to visit that people 
in the western part of the world. I 
want to read to you just a few 
words from Him in regard to the 
subject of prayer, in third Nephi, 
the 18th chapter, commencing at the 
fourteenth verse. After he had 
thoroughly taught His disciples and 
the multitude in regard to the sac- 
rament he said : 

"Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall 
keep my commandments, which the 



Father hath commanded me that I 
should give unto you. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye 
must watch and pray always, lest ye 
be tempted by the devil, and ye are 
led away captive by him. 

"And as I have prayed among you, 
even so shall ye pray in my church, 
among my people who do repent and 
are baptized in my name. Behold I 
am the light; I have set an example 
for you. 

"And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had spoken these words unto 
his disciples, he turned again unto the 
multitude and sa'd unto them, 

"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto 
you, ye must watch and pray always, 
lest ye enter into temptation; for 
Satan desireth to have you; that he 
may sift you as wheat; 

"Therefore ye must' always pray 
unto the Father in my name; 

"And whatsoever ye shall ask the 
Father in my name, which is rierht, 
believing that ye shall receive, behold 
it shall be given unto you. 

"Pray in your families unto the 
Father, always in my name, that your 
wives and your children may be 
blessed." 

These are doctrines that are en- 
tertained by the Latter-day Saints. 
We are trained therein, and as I 
say, all Latter-day Saints who are 
. in proper state, as all should be, re- 
member the Lord every morning 
and every evening, and secretly. 
Jesus not only set the example of 
prayer with the multitude and in the 
congregations of the people, but He 
prayed secretly, He retired from 
His brethren, from the people in 
Jerusalem, and also on this conti- 
nent He retired from His disciples, 
leaving them to pray with the multi- 
tude, and more than once did He re- 
tire and present Himself before the 
Lord, rejoicing exceedingly in the 
faith and splendid labor performed 
by His disciples. He was not con- 
tent that the disciples should be 
found attending to this important 
duty, but it was required of the mul- 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



titude, and it is required of this mul- 
titude today. If I were to express 
my opinion, which I feel disposed 
to do, I would claim that there is 
not another congregation in the 
world today of ten thousand people 
so generally devoted to family wor- 
ship, and appearing before the Lord, 
as this body of men and women, 
Latter-day Saints, and some of our 
neighbors who are with us here to- 
day. In this great congregation 
there are many who are not Latter- 
day Saints, and who have learned 
the fact that prayer is the rule of 
our lives; it is required of us, and 
we observe that requirement fairly 
well. When the President this 
morning suggested that he was 
fearful that we are a little careless, 
I could quite agree with him that 
that may be the case, but with all 
that, and with all our weaknesses, I 
believe that there is not another 
people in the world that so uni- 
formly and generally bow the knee 
before the Lord in family prayer, 
and that appear before the Lord in_ 
secret prayer on all occasions. The 
Lord requires that we shall pray 
always, and that we should watch 
always, that we should always be 
on the watch and always ready to 
pray. 

I suggest to this great body of 
people, if they have not heard it 
many times before, I want to sug- 
gest it today, that when we meet 
together in this great Tabernacle, 
or in any other gathering place of 
the Latter-day Saints, and our 
brethren of the Priesthood are re- 
quired to minister to us, it is the 
duty of every Latter-day Saint, in 
his heart and in her heart, to ask 
the Lord to bless His servant who 
is speaking to us. That is a prayer 
that should be offered by this great 
body , of people, by every individual 



soul; it should be the training of 
our lives. I believe that President 
Wilson will not find a people in the 
United States that will give greater 
care, thought and faith "to his 
proclamation than have the Latter- 
day Saints on this occasion ; and we 
will be prepared to pray whenever 
he wants us to pray, if he will only 
keep peace in the country so that we 
don't have to engage in fighting. 
Prayer is very much better than 
warfare. I wanted to say that much 
in regard to the subject of prayer. 
If Latter-day Saints have a neces- 
sity for reformation upon that sub- 
ject, we should address ourselves to 
entering into the spirit of prayer, 
and maintain and enjoy it con- 
stantly. We should remember the 
Lord always, and especially in the 
season thereof. All Latter-day 
Saints, thoroughly trained, under- 
stand that the season of prayer in 
the home is in the morning and in 
the evening, and that secretly we 
should remember the Lord on all 
occasions, and our hearts should go 
out to Him! I do not know that T 
ever felt more distinctly than I did 
this morning, when the President 
spoke upon that subject, the fact of 
the importance of the Lord to us, 
for in Him we live and without Him 
we die. In Him we move, and with- 
out Him we will never move. In 
Him we have our being, without 
Him we would not be; we would 
not have been, nor yet would we be 
in the future. Whatever we have 
and enjoy comes from the Lord ; we 
ought to recognize that fact, and I 
presume no people in the world do 
so as thoroughly as do the Latter- 
day Saints. 

My mind has been occupied just 
lately upon the subject of our min- 
istry, my brethren and sisters, and 
I want to say a few words in regard ' 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



29 



to that subject. I see to the right 
here the Presidents of Seventies. I 
find that in the Church there are 
very many thousands of seventies ; 
they have become very abundant 
and they are being multiplied. Dis- 
covering that the nations in trouble 
and in war has made it necessary 
for us to call many of pur elders 
home, and release those whose mis- 
sions were completed, and give 
those who were just starting out 
new fields in other nations, I would 
ask that the brethren who have the 
direction of their labors, of their 
ordinations and training and so 
forth, should give careful attention 
to the body of seventies in this 
Church. We are preaching the 
Gospel as best we can in the world 
with the elders, quite generally, 
when in preference to the elders, 
and the Lesser Priesthood and high 
priests, the seventies should be 
found in the field, every seventy. 
When I was called and ordained a 
seventy, I was instructed that I had 
become a minute man. I have been 
a minute man for over fifty years, 
ready and willing at any moment. 
I believe that I have never hesitated 
when I was wanted in the field, for 
I have been a seventy from that 
time, and expect to be as long as I 
keep the faith. We need the seven- 
ties, Bishops and presidents, the 
general presidency, the" presiding 
presidency of the seventies, and 
presidency of quorums of seven- 
ties, we want the seventies ; we need 
them in our business of preaching 
the Gospel. I hold that no man 
should be ordained a seventy unless 
he is prepared to work, that is work 
in the ministry abroad. It isn't nec- 
essary that men should be ordained 
seventies to work at home, for the 
elders have ample authority to work 
at home. In the home mission 



fields, so far as that is concerned, 
the seventies are perfectly compe- 
tent, but they are expected to labor 
in the foreign ministry, as those 
upon whom the Twelve depend, and 
call upon, in preference to all others. 
I want to interpret that scripture for 
the benefit of the seventies in this 
Church. Bishops and presidents of 
stakes, and all who are intrusted 
with recommending elders for the 
field, should regard it as their duty 
to recommend the seventies in pref- 
erence to any other elders in the 
Church, for foreign ministry. Every 
seventy should be in condition to go, 
that is be ready to go ; and his con- 
dition should be such that he is able 
to go. If he is not able to go into 
the field, he may take a place with 
the elders and high priests, and he 
can labor at home, because there is 
ministry needed at home that will, 
perhaps, never be quite fully and 
completely occupied. The field is 
not filled here, no more than we can 
fill it abroad. There is work enough 
in Zion, among the Latter-day 
Saints, to occupy the labors of the. 
ten thousand or more seventies that 
are now at home. The elders and 
high priests can take care of that 
labor, as well as to go abroad when 
necessary. But, we advise that our 
brethren of the seventies, wdio have 
had experience and training, and 
possibly have been in the missionary 
field at least once, and also had 
training and experience at home, 
that they be put into the field. We 
want at least one of them by the 
side of every two elders or inex- 
perienced men ; we would rather 
have more. We would like them to 
have the opportunity, and it should 
be the pride of every seventy in this 
Church to fulfill one mission, and 
after he has fulfilled that one mis- 
sion he should be willing to fill an- 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other mission to preach the Gospel. 
These are opportunities that are 
very precious to the elders in Israel. 
The Priesthood is given to them 
and to us to magnify. When the 
presiding brethren in the Church, 
in the stakes and quorums, and in 
every department are called upon, 
and are set apart and instructed, it 
is because they are needed, and 
should be employed. We are will- 
ing, the Twelve are willing, to put 
our hands upon those brethren and 
bless them and send them forth, if 
you will send them to us. We don't 
think it necessary to multiply sev- 
enties simply to fill up quorums of 
seventies and keep them here at 
home, not at all. We want them 
prepared and ready to preach the 
Gospel. We want that to be the 
pride of their lives, to work while 
they are in the prime of life, and 
can stand the hardships that attend 
upon missionary service ; and those 
who are unable to go abroad and 
do that, can take place with the high 
priests, and work in the home min- 
istry, there is plenty of labor here. 

I want to draw your . attention 
also, my brethren of the Priesthood, 
that it is not alone the foreign min- 
istry, it is not alone the utilizing of 
the labors of the seventies, nor yet 
of the high priests and elders 
abroad, but the great and most im- 
portant work of all is to engage the 
efforts and labors of the Priesthood 
at home. Every man who bears the 
Priesthood is a minister, a teacher 
and preacher, and should teach and 
preach and magnify his priesthood 
and calling, which is pleasing unto 
the Lord. Every member of the 
Church, not only those who bear the 
Priesthood but all others, should be 
suitably considered, suitably labored 
with, young men and young women, 
and older ones also, property 



trained, instructed and brought into 
the service of the Lord until they 
become nearly faultless as mortal 
men and women can be, working 
diligently and faithfully every day, 
accomplishing some good minis- 
terial work. Our sisters have mis- 
sionary fields at home to fill as well 
as some that go abroad, but gener- 
ally their fields of labor are domes- 
tic; they belong at home, but there 
is a ministry for them also, an op- 
portunity for them to teach the 
truth. They can advocate it, and 
they can live it and fulfill the pur- 
poses of the Lord at home. Cottage 
meetings and other gatherings 
should be arranged, so that those 
who become careless, or that are 
situated so that it is difficult for 
them to overcome their conditions, 
either from physical weakness or 
otherwise, may be found and known, 
that the Bishop of the ward can 
vouch to his stake presidency that 
every man, woman and child in his 
ward is being suitably considered 
and cared for, spiritually fed and 
instructed. That should be done, 
and there are plenty of the lesser 
and higher priesthood that haven't 
anything of a ministry on their 
hands to prevent them performing 
this labor. Thus all the Latter-day 
Saints may be inspired, and prompt- 
ed, and reminded of their duties, 
and stirred up to become alive, like 
live coals ; and become prayerful, 
and partake of the sacrament when- 
ever they can do so. Latter-day 
Saints can't be quite perfect without 
partaking of the sacrament ; neither 
can they become perfect without at- 
tending to their prayers on suitable 
occasions, and in due season. Then 
there is the services that fathers owe 
to their children, husbands to wives, 
parents to children, wives to hus- 
bands ; those services and helps that 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 31 



strengthen each other's faith can be 
performed in the homes, even if 
they can't reach the houses of wor- 
ship. But it is pleasing to the Lord 
that we should gather together on 
the Sabbath day in the houses of 
worship, all members of the Church. 
That is what we should do. There 
is inspiration in a congregation, in 
a multitude of people listening to 
the word and will of the Lord. The 
Lord is willing to inspire His ser- 
vants in their own families and 
homes, men who are so strong in 
the faith that they can attend to all 
requirements that are necessary in 
their families, to bless their children, 
administer to the sick and impart 
other blessings. They are author- 
ized to do such service, they belong 
to every household and family in 
the Church, and those who live for 
those blessings are entitled to re- 
ceive them. I wanted to say that 
much. 

I am delighted with the oppor- 
tunity to speak to such an enormous 
congregation as we have here today, 
the brethren representing all the 
stakes and many of the missions in 
the United States. I would be de^ 
lighted if we could have the presi- 
dents of other missions with us on 
such occasions. If they only could 
reach us as handily as those in the 
United States it is probable they 
would be here, to meet with us. 
Those who can meet with the 
Twelve twice a year and we look 
them over, and inquire after them, 
and after their conditions, and con- 
cerning their fields of labor and the 
missionaries entrusted to them ; and 
require of them that they shall look 
carefully to the conditions of the 
young men that we send to them, 
that they shall be trained, that they 
should watch and pray always. We 
discover that it is very fitting that 



presidents of missions should watch 
and pray always, that they should 
watch the interests entrusted to 
them; that presidents of stakes 
should be watchful, and bishops of 
wards, and presidents of high priests 
quorums, and of seventies quorums, 
and elders quorums, and the bishops 
at the head of the lesser priesthood, 
that all these men should be wide- 
awake, and know the individuals 
that they have to deal with. 

The brethren of the Twelve are 
not a very large body, and the First 
Council of Seventies added to us 
makes just a few brethren to look 
over the missionary work of this 
Church, the ministry of the Church 
at home and abroad. You will find, 
I say, and these presidents of stakes, 
I think, can bear witness, that we 
look them over, we inquire after 
them, and after high councils, and 
after the bishops and counselors, 
and prominent men in the quorums, 
so far as we have opportunity to 
find them, we look them over, in- 
quire after them, and know their 
status. It is the duty of the brethren 
in the stakes and wards, and in the 
quorums, to know the nature of 
their assistants in the priesthood, 
and when they bring them into posi- 
tions of responsibility, give them 
employment, much or little, what- 
ever they do, they should know what 
their conditions are, and if they are 
fully worthy and qualified for the 
responsibility that is given them. 
Especially when we recommend 
brethren to go into the world, to go 
abroad into the nations of the earth, 
they should be prayerful, faithful 
and humble, they should be alto- 
gether worthy, moral, upright and 
true ; this is very necessary. 

I suppose while men are in the 
flesh they are liable to get into some 
trouble, some difficulties. We are

sometimes high strung, and sin with 
our lips and tongues; we talk has- 
tily and say things inconsiderately. 
We ought to have ourselves in good 
training so that whatever we do is 
well and properly done. All men 
who are Latter-day Saints, who 
have repented, and been baptized for 
the remission of their sins, and have 
received the gift of the Holy Ghost 
through the laying on of hands, 
every such man is inspired by the 
Lord with the understanding that it 
is quite possible for him to do what 
is right. And there isn't any ex- 
cuse for men to do wrong, no justi- 
fication ; we can't plead any excuse. 
I care not what my neighbor does, 
what my brother does and others 
do, and how much they may be 
wrong, I have no excuse or justifi- 
cation for doing wrong, for the law 
is we should do good for evil. That 
is the standard of Latter-day Saints, 
that we do good for evil, that we 
pray for our enemies if we have any, 
and pray for our friends, and bless 
them, and appreciate them because 
we have none to spare, we need 
them all, and are grateful for them. 
We want the arrangement of stakes, 
and wards, and quorums and asso- 
ciations such that these organiza- 
tions will accomplish the purposes 
for which they were designed, for 
the salvation of the people, for their 
own salvation, and to labor for the 
salvation of others. That is the min- 
istry that belongs to the Latter-day 
Saints, and we are laboring in our 
ministry at home. 

I want to say for brethren and 
sisters who can't go abroad, what- 
ever their conditions and reasons are 
that they can't go into ministry 
abroad, that their missions and min- 
istry at home is just as acceptable, 
just as profitable and pleasing in the 
sight of God as a missionary service 



abroad, just exactly. I have had a 
little experience abroad as well as 
at home, and I have learned the les- 
son that it is just as important and 
valuable for a man to labor at home 
as it is abroad, and it is just as easy ; 
and the Spirit of the Lord is as 
generous to come to the aid of an 
elder at home as it would if he 
were in a mission field abroad. To 
cure conditions suggested by the 
President here, I think it was this 
morning, the brethren should be 
taken hold of and employed when 
they return from their missions. 
Every man who performs a mission 
and does it in the proper spirit, and 
is gone two or three years, when he 
comes home he should have good 
training, and have stamina enough 
in him to attend to his duties and 
to furnish employment for himself, 
and find something that needs to be 
done. In the mission field, they find 
something to do, they are not fol- 
lowed by the president, they are 
there at liberty among the people in 
the world, and they find people to 
labor with, they find something to 
say and something to do, and they 
have that kind of field and ministry 
right here at home in every stake, 
in every ward, in every quorum, in 
every family. The Lord has gener- 
ously bestowed His divine authoriu 
upon man, so that every man in the 
Church, almost, bears the priest- 
hood, and the Lord serves notice on 
you, my brethren, from the high 
priest to the deacon, that there is a 
ministry for you to perform. You 
should engage yourself therein, just 
as the patriarchs, presidents of 
stakes, bishops of wards, and the 
Twelve, the Presidency of the 
Church, thev are never at a loss to 
find something to do. The only 
question is whether they can find 
time to do what is required of them

and do all things that are expected 
of them. There is a ministry and 
mission for the Latter-day Saints 
everywhere. I have thought that if 
the world should cast us out, and we 
would have to stay at home, suppose 
we could only have peace in Zion, 
that is on our own continent, why 
there is opportunity here for all 
Latter-day Saints to lahor. If there 
should be war in our nation, or any- 
thing occur that we would not be 
permitted to mingle among the peo- 
ple in different parts of this conti- 
nent, North and South America, and 
we were confined to our own popu- 
ation of the few states that we are 
interested in here, there is need for 
ministry here. There are people 
who haven't received the truth, 
haven't listened, they have not 
opened their hearts to receive the 
message that has been sent to them 
by the Lord, the message of the 
restoration of the Gospel and the 
doctrines of the Gospel, the princi- 
ple of faith, without which no man 
can please God. 

Men who denounce faith in God 
can't please Him at all, because they 
don't believe there is a God. We 
must believe there is a God, and 
have faith in Him, and in His pow- 
er, and in the doctrine of repentance. 
Without repentance it is not possi- 
ble for men to please God, and with- 
out baptism we can't please God; 
without receiving the gift of the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of 
hands it is not' possible for us to 
please the Lord; that is to please 
Him entirely. The Lord is pleased 
with every good thing that we do, 
and that any of His children do, 
righteous, proper things. Good 
things that are done are pleasing in 
the sight of the Lord so far as they 
go, the truth told and righteousness 
accomplished ; but to fulfill the pur- 



poses of the Lord, and please and 
satisfy Him, and for our salvation, 
compliance with the ordinances of 
the Gospel is important and neces- 
sary, indispensable. I want to tes- 
tify to you, as your brother, that 
without these doctrines men cannot 
be saved, and it takes all of them, 
it isn't enough for a man to be per- 
fect in any one form. That is good 
as far as it goes, but he must be 
good in all points ; he must be faith- 
ful and true in all things ; he must 
be perfect as our Father in heaven 
is perfect, and our Father in heaven 
is just perfect enough to do just 
exactly what is right. He does just 
exactly what is right with us. Jesus 
did the same, He walked in the 
footsteps of His Father, and we are 
expected, when He sets the example 
for us as He says He did, for He 
invites us; we should follow in His 
footsteps, and do as He has done to 
earn the same right to be heirs of 
God and joint heirs with Him in all 
that the Father possesses, that is the 
promise that is given to us. Those 
promises, and the Spirit of the Lord 
that accompanies His service, estab- 
lishes these strong men in the faith. 

You take these men, sixty-six 
men that stand at the head as presi- 
dents of stakes, and twice as many 
counselors and, then take these 
seven hundred and thirty-five bish- 
ops, and twice as many counselors 
with them, they constitute a strong 
body of men, and they are laboring 
diligently as they are directed, and 
they listen, they take counsel, and 
they commune with the Lord, and 
they are substantial and solid in 
their calling. They know the doc- 
trines and principles of the Gospel, 
and they are serving God and keep- 
ing His commandments. They are 
shepherds of the flocks, and saviors 
among the people, and they are per-

forming works such as I have sug- 
gested should be performed, and all 
Latter-day Saints are thoroughly 
trained and taken care of, none 
overlooked. I want to draw your 
attention to the fact that it is the 
sick that need the physicians, but 
often it is the well that receive the 
chief attention from the physicians. 
That is the trouble, because those 
that are well we find easily, they 
are right in our way all the time, 
but those that are sick need to be 
hunted up by the physicians, and re- 
ceive treatment at their hands. 

May God bless us with peace on 
earth and good will among men. 
that the prayers offered this day 
throughout our nation may have the 
weight that is necessary, and influ- 
ence the great Christian nations 
who now have their swords drawn 
against each other, trying to destroy 
each other's lives by the tens of 
thousands, that they may be brought 
to think, and cease their war and 
bloodshed. What a shame and hu- 
miliation it is; you and I might just 
as well turn in and fight each other ; 
there is no sense nor reason to it. 
If a nation gets to balking, there 
ought to be influence and power 
enoucrh in other nations of the earth 

• 

to box their ears, make them sit 
down and behave themselves. That's 
the way the brethren do with me. T 
tell you they keep me pretty 
straight, I have got to walk just as 
straight as can be. I hold that every 
nation in this world should be held 
in such control that they would 
have to behave themselves. The 
majority should rule, and rule for 
the right. When the Lord has His 
way I tell you that peace will reign 
on earth, and there will be good will 
among men. 

God bless all Tsrael, and God bless 
oiir friends that need the blessings 
and favor and help of the Lord to 



settle their difficulties, that peace 
may come presently, and that it will 
not be necessary to destroy the lives 
of so many precious and valuable 
men, leaving two or three or four 
other Christians broken hearted for 
every man that dies in the war. 
•May the Lord come to their rescue, 
I humbly pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

I have taken great pleasure to- 
day not only in listening to the re- 
marks that have been made by our 
brethren who have addressed us but 
in looking upon this great congre- 
gation. I don't believe that such an 
assembly can be duplicated or has 
been duplicated anywhere through- 
out the land. One thing I am sure 
of, and that is that there cannot be 
found anywhere within the confines 
of the United States an assembly 
of people so united in mind and 
spirit, so devotional as this congre- 
gation now assembled from various 
parts of the land of Zion. 

It is a joy to my soul to look upon 
this assembly, to be in the society of 
men and women of the character 
of those who have gathered here, to 
look upon such a number of the vet-

erans of the Church, veterans in the 
great latter-day work which the 
Lord has begun on the face of the 
earth, men of faith, men of honesty, 
men of honorable character and 
mind ; men of virtue who have re- 
sisted the temptations and allure- 
ments of the world ; tried men, men 
who have been placed in positions 
wherein their courage and their 
fidelity have been tested, and they 
have been worthy and have stood 
the trial and the struggle and, so 
far, have been able to overcome. 
Now they are getting prepared to 
enter into their rest so far as their 
bodies are concerned, to close their 
earthly career, and to enter upon a 
wider and higher sphere in the 
spirit, still to be engaged in the 
great latter-day work, the work of 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, only part of which can be 
accomplished on the earth in the 
flesh, a great deal of which has to 
be performed in a different sphere, 
in the spirit world, for the work of 
the Lord pertains to those who have 
departed as well as those who are 
remaining here on the earth in the 
body. They are His sons and daugh- 
ters just the same when they have 
parted with their earthly forms, and 
have gone into the world behind the 
veil and all have to be prepared for 
the great events which lie before 
them, and all have to learn the mind 
and will of the great Father of all. 

This idea, which I merely repeat 
— nothing original about it nowa- 
days, because the Lord has trained 
onr minds in this direction for many 
years — this idea may be strange to 
some people, who take the notion 
that has been planted in their minds 
by false teachers for centuries, that 
this life, this stage of our existence, 
is the only one wherein man can re- 
ceive the principles and doctrine of 
salvation through Jesus Christ, our 



Redeemer, and that when death 
comes, that ends their opportunity. 
The Lord has revealed to us this is 
not true, that we are His sons and 
daughters whether in the body or 
out of the body ; that He is our 
Father, the Father of our spiritual 
part, which is the most important 
part, not saying anything against 
the importance of the temporal part, 
for the body has to endure, its ele- 
ments persist, and the time is to 
come when all persons who have 
lived in the body will have their 
earthly tenements revived. 

The Lord has shown to us that 
the elements are eternal and that it 
requires the eternal union of spirit 
and element to obtain a fulness of 
joy. For the spirit part of man and 
the earthly, or temporal part just 
now, shall be united together per- 
petually, eternally, the body and the 
spirit being made one again, only 
joined together after the power of 
an endless life, that without that 
union a fulness of joy cannot be ob- 
tained. That is very easy to under- 
stand in a degree, if we will reflect 
upon our nature and upon the posi- 
tion that we now occupy. The spirit 
having come from above and the 
body from beneath, the spirit be- 
ing born from God who is the 
Father literally, the Father of the 
spirit, and the body formed from 
the earthly elements, through 
earthly parentage, without this body 
many things that will give joy, 
pleasure, power, increase, perpet- 
uity, cannot be enjoyed. This is ra- 
t'onal. The spirit reaches out to that 
which is spiritual ; the body reaches 
down to that which is called tem- 
poral, that is, physical — the grosser 
materials of earth and air and all 
the surroundings that pertain there- 
unto. These are realities as much as 
those that are spiritual. 

There is a notion that has ob- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



taineci somewhat in the world, in 
philosophy and in some things that 
are called religions, that earthly 
things, those things we can see and 
handle and taste and experience in 
the common way of nature, will all 
pass away -and be no more. That is 
a result of the notion that "in the 
beginning" the earth was made out 
of nothing and that man's body was 
made out of nothing, because the 
term "create" has been used in re- 
lation to this part of God's great 
work. "Creation," properly speak- 
ing, is organization ; so we have 
learned through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and that the elements, the 
fundamental principles of that which 
we call temporal, are eternal, with- 
out beginning and therefore without 
end, that the earth and the things 
upon it were not fashioned out of 
nothing but out of something. "Out 
of nothing, nothing comes" is an old 
adage of years and ages ago ( ex 
nihil nihil fit), and we have learned 
that it is true, that though the earth- 
ly elements may be formed and un- 
formed, so to speak, can be organ- 
ized or disintegrated, yet that they, 
in their original nature and charac- 
ter are something, that they are just 
as eternal and just as real as that 
which is spiritual, and the spiritual 
is just as real and enduring and 
tangible to spirits as earthly sub- 
stances are to those that are earthly. 

We have learned this by revela- 
tion. It has not been a philosoph- 
ical theory invented by anybody nor 
conceived by anybody, but it is the 
word of God given to mankind in 
the nineteenth century through that 
great Prophet and Seer and Reve- 
alator, Joseph Smith, who yielded up 
his life to the hands of wicked men 
and, like the prophets of old. sealed 
his testimony with his blood. Now, 
that which is temporal at present 



will be made eternal, that is, in its 
form. That was the resurrection 
taught by Jesus of Nazareth, taught 
to His apostles that they might teach 
it when they went forth to all the 
world. That was the very founda- 
tion of their testimony concerning 
the Christ ; that He died on the 
cross by way of atonement for the 
sins of the world; that the just died 
for the unjust that He might bring 
them to God, but that He was raised 
again from the dead. And they bore 
witness to this great fact wherever 
they went. It was one of the grand 
truths that they had to present to 
the world, and they proclaimed it 
everywhere. It was for the cause 
of the resurrection of the dead that 
they stood and that they lived and 
prayed and died. 

A great many of our modern 
"Christian" theorists and philoso- 
phers who are ministers of what 
they call the Gospel, deny this now. 
They think those men were only 
talking of something they imagined. 
But they bore testimony to the fact 
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ; 
and He, before He died, proclaimed 
Himself "the resurrection and the 
life." and declared that all that were 
in the graves should eventually hear 
His voice, and should come forth — 
they that had done good in the res- 
urrection of the just, and they that 
had done evil in the resurrection of 
the unjust, or as it is put in 
the Gospel of St. John, so called. 
"They that have done good in the 
resurrection of life, and they that ' 
have done evil in the resurrection of 
damnation." This was the doctrine 
that Christ taught ; this was the doc- 
trine that He exemplified in His 
career and character; and He ap- 
peared in the body that hung on the 
cross to His disciples, to the men 
and the women who surrounded the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



cross when He died. He after- 
wards appeared and showed them 
the marks of the wounds in His 
hands and in His side which were 
inflicted in His crucifixion, and pro- 
claimed the great truth that He was 
all there. Said He, "Behold, this 
is T, myself ; handle me and see, for 
a spirit hath not flesh and bones as 
you see me have. And while they 
yet believed not, for joy, and won- 
dered, He said to them, "Have ye 
here any meat, and they gave him 
a piece of broiled fish and of an 
honey-comb, and He took it and did 
eat before them." 

You will read that in the last 
chapter of what is called the Gospel 
according to Saint Luke. This, the 
body of man, then, is a part of him 
and an essential part to his joy and 
glory and development and continu- 
ance, that he may go on through all 
the eternities gaining knowledge 
and wisdom and understanding and 
experience. For, development will 
be found by and by to be an eternal 
principle, because we shall be eter- 
nal beings ; and we are now, in one 
sense of the word. Now, these 
bodies of ours have come from the 
earthly elements and, apparently, at 
any rate, will go back to those earth- 
ly elements when we die. How far 
that is true I don't know. There 
are some things that we see and 
other things that we cannot see, our 
vision only penetrates to a certain 
degree and we can't behold the es- 
sences of things. We may take one 
element and dissolve it and it ap- 
pears to go out of existence, but it 
is there in such a shape and form 
that we can't see it. 

Here is a very simple illustration : 
We take water, which is composed 
of two gases joined together in cer- 
tain definite proportions, and by the 
annlication of heat we can dissolve 



the water into vapor, or it may be 
dissolved by the heat of the sun and 
it goes out of our sight, but does it 
go out of existence ? The vaporized 
particles are still there. We can't 
see them with our natural eyes, thev 
go off into the air, and up into the 
firmament above us and, by and by, 
through condensation, they come 
back again in the form of water and 
rain down upon the earth, or in the 
form of snow upon the mountains, 
the same elements restored. The 
oxygen and hydrogen can be separ- 
ated and made invisible to mortal 
sight and can be brought together 
again as water. That is a very sim- 
ple thing, and all chemistry will go 
to bear witness of the truth of this 
principle that the elements are eter- 
nal. The body that we see may be 
dissolved as to its form, but the ele- 
ments of it, the essential parts of it, 
remain and are perpetual. 

Now there are, according to God's 
revelation, in existence these two 
principles, spirit and element, or 
matter, as the term is commonly 
used ; spirit and matter, and matter 
in its elementary and essential ex- 
istence is eternal just the same as 
spirit is. The elements of spirit and 
the elements of matter are both eter- 
nal and, according to that which 
God has revealed, it takes the eter- 
nal union of the two to bring a "ful- 
ness of joy," also to get a fulness of 
experience and power and dominion. 
•Without the body we could not take 
hold of and control the lower ele- 
ments, and without the spiritual part 
we could not reach up to the higher, 
the spiritual, to commune with 
Deity, to be in harmony with God, 
to be part of Him, to be really and 
truly His beloved sons and daugh- 
ters, walking in the way that He 
marks out, mingling with the gods 
on high, associating with them in 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



their councils and in their grand and 
mighty works under the great 
Elohim, the God of gods, the Father 
of our spirits, the Mighty and Eter- 
nal One to whom today we address 
our praises and our prayers. We 
wish that the rest of the world who 
are engaged in prayer could, in their 
thoughts and minds, reach out to this 
great Eternal Being as their Father, 
in whose image and likeness they 
are because they are His sons and 
his daughters. Every seed beget- 
teth of its kind, and we are the seed 
of God, He is our Father, and we 
are His children, and this was the 
grand truth referred to by the Lord 
Jesus Christ as stated and quoted 
and spoken upon this morning by 
President Lund. 

Now, it takes the eternal union of 
the spirit part and the physical and 
material part of man to be joined 
together in one so that he may be 
able to advance on all lines in the 
future. If we leave our bodies in 
the grave and they are restored to 
us no more, our existence will have 
to be entirely along the spiritual line 
— spirit without being joined to the 
body. But when the body is raised 
again, quickened by spirit and not 
by blood, raised up by the power of 
God, like the body of Jesus Christ 
was, and the body and the spirit are 
rejoined, and we have an eternal 
future before us, then we can draw 
from the highest heights and from 
the lowest depths of all parts of 
God's great universe everything that 
will contribute to joy, to pleasure, 
to progress and development, to 
knowledge, to wisdom, to power, 
and to dominion above all, if we 
have that glorious gift of celestial 
glory, the power of endless increase, 
worlds without end. And this is 
what we Latter-day Saints are after, 



what we are trying to get, this 
fulness of glory and joy and power 
and dominion ; in other words, to be 
made exactly like the Father. We 
read in the writings of the early 
apostles a great deal concerning 
this. The apostle John, for in- 
stance, in writing to the saints in 
his day, said : 

''Beloved, now are we the sons of 
God, and it doth not yet appear what 
we shall be; but we know that when 
He shall appear we shall be like Him, 
for we shall see Him as He is; and 
every man that hath this hope in him 
purifieth himself, even as He is pure." 
(I John 3:2, 3). 

There is the great lesson, my 
brethren and sisters, and friends. If 
we want to come into the. complete 
and perfect society of God, in His 
personality, to be where He is, to 
enjoy His company, His divine pres- 
ence, His instructions, the joy that 
comes from looking upon His coun- 
tenance, and feeling the influence 
that proceeds from Him who is our 
life, if we want that we have to be 
like Him. In this respect, to be pure, 
even as He is pure ; to keep His 
commandments; to ^walk in His 
ways ; to do that which He desires 
us to do. And this is the lesson that 
Jesus of Nazareth taught, in Flis ex- 
ample, in His life : "I came not to 
do My own will, but the will of Him 
who sent Me." That was His mot- 
to ; that should be ours. He left that 
to us "as an example, that we should 
follow in His steps ;" that we should 
be Christians. And if we really are 
Christians we will follow Christ; we 
will do that which He commanded, 
that which He came here to teach ; 
and as He gave His life for us, that 
we will value the atonement that He 
wrought out for us and show our 
appreciation for it by keeping His 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



39 



commandments. "If ye love Me, 
keep My commandments." "Every- 
one that loveth Me doeth My word." 
''He that loveth Me not keepeth not 
My sayings." That was what He 
declared, and so if we want to be 
real Christians we should find out 
what Christ taught, find out what 
He showed in His personality and 
character, that as He is we may be : 
that we may meet Him face to. face, 
that we may be one with Him in 
time and in eternity. 

We read in the writings of John, 
that He said on one occasion to His 
disciples : "He that believeth in Me, 
the works that I do shall he do also, 
and greater, works than these shall 
he do, because I go unto Mv 
Father." (John 14:12).. What is 
the meaning of that? It is that he 
will not only do the works that 
Christ did while He dwelt in the 
flesh, those works that Christ per- 
formed when He dwelt in mortality, 
but that as He was going to the 
Father, they also would go to the 
Father; that when He went away 
from this earth, whatever He did 
then they would follow and do sim- 
ilar work, and as He was going to 
the Father, they also would go to 
the Father and be with the Father 
and the Son and the Holy Ghost 
and always be under their direction. 
They would be eternally progress- 
ing, obtaining light and wisdom and 
knowledge and power and eternal 
joy. When Christ died, so we Lat- 
ter-day Saints have learned He 
went and preached to the spirits 
which were in prison. What spirits ? 
Why, we are told they were the 
spirits that were disobedient in the. 
days of Noah while the ark was 
preparing. Christ went and preached 
to them, "preached deliverance to 
those captives," "the opening of the 
prison to them that were bound ;" 



that He preached the Gospel to the 
dead, "that they might be judged 
like men in the flesh but live accord- 
ing to God in the spirit." When 
His disciples departed from the 
earth they followed in His foot- 
steps and went and preached to the 
spirits that were in the spirit world 
that needed enlightenment and 
teaching. And so in the latter days, 
the Gospel having been restored in 
its fullness, and all the powers and 
authorities and gifts and blessings 
pertaining thereto having been re- 
stored with it, the authority of the 
Holy Apostleship and all the of- 
fices and ordinances of the Holv 
Priesthood, so when the servants of 
God depart in the latter days, they 
will follow in the footsteps of the 
Redeemer in times of old, and of 
Apostles in the earlier days and pro- 
claim liberty to the captives. 

O, what a mighty host there must 
be in the spirit world who did not 
understand the Gospel of Christ! 
Think of the millions of heathen 
who never heard of Christ ! Think 
of the millions of the house of 
Judah, who have never believed in 
Christ, who have been trained up 
from their childhood to believe thai 
Jesus of Nazareth was an impostor 
and that their forefathers put Him 
to death properly, or aided in that 
great tragedy! Think of the mil- 
lions of those people called "Chris- 
tians" who have for ages been wan- 
dering in darkness and many of 
them sunk in corruptions and abom- 
inations ! Think of those whose 
blood has been shed in the wars 
between "Christian" nations, na- 
tion rising' against nation, and peo- 
ple against people, and each nation 
praying to God for strength and 
power and understanding to go 
forth and destroy the lives of other 
"Christians!" Where are they?

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Where are all these multitudes that 
have gone from the earth ? Has the 
spirit of man perished , with the 
body? Has the knowledge and un- 
derstanding and wisdom and exper- 
ience gained by dwelling in the flesh 
departed? Do wisdom and knowl- 
edge and understanding and exper- 
ience and all the ties that have been 
formed between mortals go down 
into the grave and perish when the 
body is shuffled off, when the 
earthly tenement is taken away from 
the living spirit? No. Our reason 
tells us to the contrary, and reve- 
lation denies it and proclaims that 
man is immortal, that when he dies 
his body goes to the dust, but that 
some time in the great eternity that 
lies before us that body shall be 
resuscitated, that the essential, ele- 
ments forming it and giving it pe- 
culiar identity shall be brought to- 
gether again, by a natural process to 
God but something mysterious to 
us, and that like the body of the Re- 
deemer, it shall be joined together 
with the spirit and the man shall 
stand up on his feet and be in a 
position to give account for the 
deeds done in the body. 

For man in spirit form, in his 
spirit nature, is an independent en- 
tity. It is an organized being, a 
son of God or a daughter of God, 
as the case may be, and in the spirit 
birth he obtained not only an eternal 
organization, but power and intel- 
ligence by which he can determine 
and understand light from darkness, 
truth from error, - and choose be- 
tween that which is right and that 
which is wrong. In the Pearl of 
Great Price we read that God gave 
him that power. The Lord revealed 
to Moses in the beginning, when He 
made manifest to him how this earth 
came into being and how the vari- 
ous orders of earthly creations were 



formed in their time and season, 
each of the animal creation and of 
the vegetable, bearing seed within 
themselves to be reproduced of the 
same kind always, that before this 
took place there was a council in 
the heavens and the Lord says that 
He gave to His only begotten Son 
the right to come here and perform 
the work of redemption, a power 
that was coveted by the Evil One : 

"But, behold, My Beloved Son, 
which was My beloved and chosen 
from the beginning, said unto Me — 
Father, Thy will be done, and the 
glory be Thine forever." 

"Wherefore, because that Satan re- 
belled against Me and sought to de- 
story the agency of man which I, 
the Lord God had given him, and also, 
that T should give unto him Mine own 
power; by the power of Mine Only 
Begotten, I caused that he should be 
cast down." (Book of Moses, Chap. 4.) 

Here we read that that power of 
choice, the gift, the ability to under- 
stand right from wrong, to under- 
stand light from darkness, was given 
to the spirit of man by the Lord and 
He gave to him that agency, power 
in himself to choose the good and 
refuse the evil, to choose the light 
or the darkness as he willed. So 
because of that, man can be brought 
to judgment for the deeds that he 
performs, for he is not forced to do 
evil, neither is he forced to do right. 
The power of volition is in the 
spirit man and he brings it with him 
when he is born into the earthly 
sphere, and. so we can do good or 
do evil as we elect, and therefore 
we will be brought to judgment and 
every man will be judged according 
to the deeds done while in the body : 
according to his works, so will his 
future be determined. 

Now, to explain briefly, I will say 
that the Lord has revealed that there

41 



are various degrees of the condi- 
tions of mankind in the future, but 
all are to be raised from the dead — 
everyone without exception, the good 
and the evil, the old and the young, 
the rich and the poor, all races and 
colors and conditions of men. They 
die because of the transgression of 
one; they live again because of the 
righteousness of One who redeemed 
them I and when they are brought 
up again from the dead they shall 
all come forth in their own order; 
but there is the resurrection of those 
who are Christ's. Christ was the 
first fruit of them that slept; after- 
wards, the Apostle Paul says, "those 
who are Christ's at His coming. 
Who are they ? They are they who 
keep His commandments. They are 
they who are baptized unto Him in 
water and in the Spirit. They are 
they who follow Him. They are 
they that drink of the influence that 
comes from His presence ; who fight 
the good fight, who overcome, who 
are His in very deed. He will num- 
ber up His jewels in that great day 
and they will be His at His coming, 
i [ : e will call and they will answer ; 
and they will come forth in the 
first resurrection to inherit glory 
and immortality and eternal lives, 
which means endless increase. 

Then there is another class who 
will not come up until another gath- 
ering in the resurrection. The glory 
of the first is called the glory of the 
sun. Just to make it clear to our 
minds * it is called the glory of the 
sun because the sun appears to us as 
the greatest luminary in the heav- 
ens, although it is not so in reality, 
but it is to us. The next is the 
glory of the moon — honorable men 
of the earth who are blinded by the 
craftiness of men, people who would 
not receive the Gospel in the flesh 
but afterwards receive it. they come 



forth in that portion of the resurrec- 
tion. And then there is an innumer- 
able company who were corrupt and 
wicked, who rejected the truth and 
they were thrust down to hell ; the 
rebellious and the abominable, those 
who rejected light and truth, those 
who walked in the ways of darkness. 
They go down unto death, but the 
time will come when, through the 
atonement of Christ, and the preach- . 
ing of the truth and their willing; 
obedience to it in the spirit life, theyj 
will bow the knee to God and to* 
King Immanuel, and will be brought 
forth to come up in the resurrection 
which is called telestial, the glory 
of the stars ; and as one star differs 
from another star in glory, so also 
is this resurrection from the dead. 
But they will all be brought forth. 

There is one class which will be 
different from all the rest. They 
shall be brought forth, the Lord 
says, but they will go back into their 
own place. They would not receive 
that which they might have had ; 
they would not obey that which they 
might have obeyed. They received 
the light and the truth and then 
would not use it in the way that God 
had appointed. They would not go 
on unto perfection by keeping every 
word that proceeded from the mouth 
of God, but prostituted the power 
God had given them, to rise to the 
highest heights but sunk down to 
the lowest depths ; denying the truth 
revealed to them ; shedding inno- 
cent blood ; consenting to the death 
of Christ; thus sinning against the 
Holy Ghost and becoming so cor- 
cupt and abominable that they can- 
not be redeemed. But they shall 
be brought forth from the grave and 
become subject to the devil and his 
angels in eternity. What is their 
end we do not know ; nobody knows, 
the Lord says. Some people are in- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



quiring about the end of these sons 
of perdition. The Lord says no man 
knows it, that the end thereof and 
the height and the extent and the 
depth thereof no man knoweth and 
if the Lord does reveal it to some 
He shuts up the vsion. What, then, 
is "the second death?" Why, the 
Lord tells us what that is in His 
revelation in the twenty-ninth sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
It is eternal banishment from His 
presence. He is the source of light 
and truth and power and glory and 
happiness and joy and dominion and 
increase forever, of which they will 
all be deprived. Being shut right out 
from the light, these shall go away 
into outer darkness where no ray of 
light comes, spiritual or physical — 
no ray of light from sun or moon 
or twinkling star or even a comet ; 
to be in outer darkness, and no 
wonder there is "weeping and wail- 
ing and gnashing of teeth," to use 
the scripture expression. 

Now, brethren and sisters, and 
friends, we are here on the earth for 
a purpose. It is that we may learn 
the things that pertain to this lower 
world, that we may obtain a body 
through which we can become 
acquainted with these earthly ele- 
ments and the laws that govern the 
earth on which we live and other 
planets of a similar character ; that 
we may face truth and error and 
choose the good and refuse the evil, 
or take the evil and refuse the good ; 
that we may be tested and proved 
to see what we shall be fit for in 
the future in the great future that 
lies before us all, and to form our 
family associations according to the 
mind and will of God, according to 
His law. And if we do so accord- 
ing to that law, it will be made per- 
petual — the wife sealed to the hus- 
band by the law that God has re- 



vealed will come forth in the resur- 
rection, and they will be husband 
and wife forever, and the children 
of that union, if fit to come into that 
family circle, will be there, sharing 
with the parents in the joys and the 
glories of the celestial world. If 
not, then they will have to take that 
which justice shall deal out to them. 
After justice has had its course, 
mercy wil reach out its hand and 
rescue them from darkness and de- 
spair and from banishment, but the\ 
must go into the condition for which 
they have fitted themselves. There 
isn't time to enter into the detail 
of that; but here is a point that I 
wish to touch upon before sitting 
down, that is this : 

We are left to ourselves to a large 
extent. We can appeal to our Father 
and obtain His Spirit and by the 
power of that Spirit entering into 
our personalities we can conquer the 
lusts of the flesh, the powers of 
darkness, the evils of the world ; we 
can refrain from doing harm to our 
neighbor; we can cultivate the spirit 
of peace, which is the Spirit of 
God. We can avoid the troubles 
and strifes and wars that exist in the 
world, by being in communion and 
harmony with our great Creator, by 
obeying the Gospel and being bap- 
tized into Christ. If we put on 
Christ and follow in His footsteps 
and are imbued with His Spirit we 
shall be the children of peace, the 
children of humility, the children of 
obedience, seeking to God our 
heavenly Father to guide us in the 
right path. If we turn on the other 
road we may mingle with the world 
and become imbued with its spirit 
and go clown to darkness and 
death. 

Some may say : Well, why can't 
God stop all this? Why does He 
permit these evils to be here upon 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE. 



43 



the earth ? They are a part of the 
present conditions of this world in 
which we live and the things that 
pertain to it. It was intended to be 
a world of trial and testing and 
proving. God could stop the wars 
that exist on the continent of Eur- 
ope, but He permits them. Why? 
Because He will not interfere with 
the agency of man, that He gave 
him in the beginning before He 
gave it to our parents in the Garden 
Sf Eden and which we have inher- 
ited — power in ourselves, so that we 
may exercise this great gift of lib- 
erty, in freedom. He will not re- 
strain us; He will not prevent us. 
Satan can't force us, but we walk 
in the ways of Satan when we yield 
to him, and we walk in the ways of 
God when we yield to Him, and we 
shall find when we get to understand 
all of God's purposes concerning 
this earth, and other worlds that He 
has created, that these intelligences 
which are born of Him are placed in 
these opposing conditions that they 
may manifest what they are fit for 
in the great future, and a place will 
be found for everyone and every- 
one will find his place in the vast 
Eternity to which we are all hasten- 
ing. 

And now here, today, we have this 
power within ourselves; and if w.e 
will exercise it for right, right will 
come to us. If we seek after the 
good, good will come to us. If we 
reach up to the Eternal Father for 
His light and guidance and power 
it will come to us. If we yield to the 
power of that Evil One and walk in 
the ways of the wicked and yield 
ourselves to sin and are imbued with 
the spirit of the Adversary, then 
we will go down to darkness and to 
death.. It is our duty and our privi- 
lege, and it should be our pleasure 
and joy, to do the will of the Father, 



to keep His commandments, to walk 
in His ways. And these good men 
whom I alluded to in the beginning 
of my remarks who have fought the 
good fight so long, let them take 
care that in their latter days they do 
not wander into darkness and go 
down to death and lose the gift and 
power and glory that shall come to 
the Saints of God. but endure faith- 
ful to the end. 

Let us continue, my brethren and 
sisters, in this grand and glorious 
work to which God has called us. I 
know that He has called us today; 
that He raised up Joseph Smith in 
the Nineteenth century to introduce 
and usher in this grand and mighty 
latter-day work in which we have 
labored so long. Now, let us con- 
tinue while we have strength and 
power and ability and endure to the 
end of our earthly career, and then 
when we pass away we will have a 
wider sphere, greater works to per- 
form than we had while we dwelt in 
the flesh. We shall be rid for the 
time being of that which drew us 
down to the earth by the law of 
gravitation. We will mount up to 
the spirit world, and we will carry 
the Gospel to countless millions of 
the once inhabitants of the earth, 
and in the footsteps of our Lord 
Jesus Christ we will walk always 
until the resurrection day shall 
dawn, and in the glorious morning 
thereof we shall come forth, clothed 
with power and glory and immortal- 
ity and eternal lives, and with our 
loved ones gathered around us we 
will go right into the family of our 
Eternal Father, and while endless 
ages roll along we will glorify God 
and keep His laws and walk in Flis 
ways and obtain power and domin- 
ion forever. May God bless us and 
enable us to be faithful in all things 
and do our duty in every respect. 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Let us hearken to the counsel that 
we have had today from our Presi- 
dent and our brethren, and perform 
our duties faithfully and untiringly 
and we shall have joy therein while 
we live, power and glory when we 
depart, and in the eternal future we 
shall tie come one with God and 
Christ and the Holy Ones forever. 
Amen. 



President Joseph F. Smith ex- 
pressed his appreciation of the ex- 
cellent doctrinal discourse just de- 
livered by President Penrose, and 
said : "He has explained in the 
greatest clearness and simplicity the 
great principle of eternal life, which 
is the power of God unto salvation. 

"I believe every word of it, and I 
want to know how many of you be- 
lieve as I do." 

On the call for a show of hands 
the entire vast assembly responded 
in the affirmative. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The 
nations bow to Satan's thrall ;" the 
soprano solo part was sung by Sis- 
ter Elizabeth T. Edward. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 
a. m., Monday, Oct. 5th. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Joseph F. 
Smith, Jr., presided. 



The Waterloo Ward choir, con- 
ducted by Arthur McFarlane, furn- 
ished the musical service, accomp- 
anied by a string quartette; Tracy 
Y. Cannon organist. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Come, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love, in every breast; 

Then shall we know, and taste, and feel 
The joys that cannot be expressed. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
Nathan Hawkes. ; 

The choir sang the anthem 
"Hark ! hark my Soul !" 

ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER. 

(President of Utah Stake.) 

I feel grateful, my brethren and 
sisters, for the opportunity of associ- 
ating with the Latter-day Saints in 
this conference. I feel to appreciate 
the blessings which we all enjoy 
in listening to the servants of the 
Lord. I think that we do appreci- 
ate President Joseph F. Smith, and 
that we appreciate President Lund, 
and President Penrose. I think we 
all appreciate the Twelve, the gen- 
eral authorities of the Church, the 
organization to which we belong, 
and that Priesthood which many of 
us are favored to hold. I believe 
our appreciation goes out to our 
heavenly Father to the extent of our 
ability to appreciate ; and T believe, 
as we work further in this Church, 
that we shall have greater capacity 
to understand and appreciate the 
Gospel of our Savior, and we shall 
have, in time, a fullness of joy. 

We belong to a wonderful or- 
ganization. We do not know of a 
greater organization ever existing 



ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER. 



45 



upon, the face of the earth than now 
exists. We know that the Gospel 
has been upon the earth in times 
past. But inasmuch as this is the 
fullness of times, when all things 
shall be brought together in one, we 
are constrained to believe that this 
organization, for the salvation of the 
human family, is the greatest that, 
ever existed upon the face of the 
earth. I know that we do appreciate 
the blessings of our heavenly Father 
in His appearing with His Son Jesus 
Christ to the boy Joseph, and giving 
authority to him to proceed with 
His work upon the earth. He said to 
Joseph: "This is My beloved Son, 
hear Him." And then the other told 
Joseph many wonderful things, and 
made known the mission that he, 
Toseph, was to perform upon the 
earth. My brethren and sisters, this 
organization, this Church of Jesus 
Christ, has the personal supervision 
of the Redeemer. It was begun by 
Kim, and was fostered by Him. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith received in- 
struction from the Savior from time 
to time, as was necessary for the 
establishment of this Church. Fur- 
thermore, when ever it was neces- 
sary, angels came and instructed 
the Prophet Joseph, and those who 
were associated with him. Angels 
came and gave power and authority, 
as they were directed from on high, 
to the Prophet Joseph, that he might 
go forth and organize the Church of 
fesus Christ. 

When we think of it, it is wonder- 
ful to our minds. We say that the 
constitution of the United States on 
which our government is founded is 
a great and a glorious instrument, 
and so it is. But, in. the considera- 
tion, and in the bringing together 
of those principles which compose 
that instrument, it took the best 



wisdom of many men and many 
minds. In fact, it was not the work 
wholly of those who were its fram- 
ers, for they had the benefit of the 
experience and learning of others 
who were behind them, and we say 
this is a mighty instrument. It was 
by the will of the Father that it was 
given to the children of men, and 
especially to those who composed 
this nation. But here we have a 
young man, not learned in these 
things, not learned in the schemes 
of government, we behold him set- 
ting forth the principles of a gov- 
ernment which not only gives liberty 
to men, liberty to develop as men 
among their fellow men, but it also 
holds out to all mankind salvation 
now and hereafter. Now we see 
that this could be done only by the 
guidance of the Holy Spirit and the 
instruction of heavenly beings : 
therefore we are fortunate indeed 
that we belong to such an organiza- 
tion. • 

Christ did not organize this 
Church through His servants, and 
then go off and leave it, He is here 
today. His guiding hand is over 
all those delegated by His authority 
and inspired by Him, and He it is 
who is guiding this Church, as He 
also guides the nations. I say we 
are particularly blessed by having 
a membership in this Church. 1. 
for one, feel to appreciate these 
great blessings. Furthermore, we 
have the principles and ordinance- 
of the Gospel ; sometimes we say the 
first principles, those things that are 
fundamental. Well now, men talked 
about faith and repentance and bap- 
tism and the Holy Ghost, a long 
time before Joseph Smith's day ; but 
were these principles of power and 
authority to the human family, the 
principles of salvation ? Were these 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the principles that would lead men 
back into the presence of the 
Father ? They were ; provided they 
had been coupled with authority and 
the power of the Holy Ghost. But, 
there were no men for ages, upon 
the face of the earth who had the 
authority to say to a man, If you 
will have faith in God, if you will 
believe that He is, if you will re- 
pent of your sins and will go down 
into the waters of baptism, you shall 
receive a remission of your sins and 
ultimately be saved in the kingdom 
of God. Men might say that, but 
how many had the authority to say 
it, and could assist in making it 
good? But now we have this au- 
thority among us, it having been del- 
egated of God, and this boy Joseph 
Smith was called of God, authorized 
of our heavenly Father, to build up 

\ this Church and this kingdom. 

\ These first principles of the Gos- 
pel, some of which were mentioned 
in our hearing this morning by 
President Smith and President 
Lund, have now become alive to us. 
They become a source of power unto 
us. They are all necessary, just as 
necessary as the waters that spring 
from the earth, or the rain from the 
clouds or the dews of heaven are 
necessary for the nourishment of the 
plants, so are these principles nec- 
essary for the nourishment and de- 
velopment of man's soul And in- 
deed they have connected with them 
a power. They take hold of the 
soul of man, and cause it to grow 
and to develop. Faith, this mighty 
principle of power that we talk of, 
is a living fountain of power within 
man, and man is so organized by his 
Maker that he may develop this 
power within him, so that in time he 
may say, as God said in times past 
to the world. Be ye in existence, be 



ye framed, come into being. He 
can develop himself to the extent 
that he can have this power, as it is 
given unto him through God, the 
Eternal Father. 

We should take hold of these prin- 
ciples and strive to apply them in 
our lives. How can we increase our 
faith in God? How can we gain 
power by this principle? Why, 
simply by the exercise of the power 
of faith in our hearts. We must 
have a great desire in our hearts 
for these things.. We must put 
forth our hands whenever occas- 
ion arises in order to develop this 
power within us. Exercise faith? 
Yes. Do the sick need to be healed ? 
Yes. There has never been a prom- 
ise annulled. If the sick exercise 
faith, and those who are called in of 
the Priesthood exercise faith, the 
sick shall be healed ; if they are not 
appointed unto death they shall rise : 
if they die, they die unto the Lord, 
if they live they live unto the Lord. 
What a mighty opportunity there is 
for the blessing and also for the 
cultivation of this power within 
man, to exercise it whenever occa- 
sion requires. The sick will be 
healed ; the sick are healed by this 
power. So it is in every direction 
in our lives Repentance also may 
become a live thing. When men 
exercise repentance, they cease to do 
those things which they know are 
against the law of God, or against 
the law of their being, against the 
laws of humanity. When they 
begin to exercise this principle of 
repentance, by turning away from 
those things which are wrong, then 
they become strong in repentance, 
they are more powerful, they have 
more power to overcome the next 
temptation that may confront them. 
But if a man never practices re- 



ELDER JOSEPH B. KEELER. 



47 



pentance, if he never repents of his 
sins, of course he will have hard 
work, because the power to over- 
come is very limited within him ; 
but to the extent that he knows he 
has gone astray and has done that 
which he knows is not pleasing in 
the sight of God, and then turns 
away from sin, he becomes power- 
ful in that he can quickly make 
amends for those things which he 
may happen to do which are wrong. 

Every child of God that enters 
into the kingdom must come in by 
the door of baptism. And why? 
Because God has instituted it. We 
may philosophize today, and say 
many things for and against this 
ordinance; but there is no denying 
the fact, no man will ever get into 
the kingdom of God without this 
ordinance being complied with. It 
is a principle of power, it is a prin- 
ciple of salvation, and there is no 
other way by which man can enter 
in at the door of the kingdom of 
God, except through the door of 
baptism. And so it is with the Holy 
Ghost. As I said before, men knew 
of this Holy Spirit. They have read 
about it, but they have only to a 
limited extent received of its power. 
None of them have had that par- 
ticular and peculiar promise and 
endowment of the Holy Ghost, ex- 
cept it be through the laying on of 
hands by those having authority. 
Then, when they have received this 
Spirit, it becomes a spirit of power 
to them. Thenceforward men may 
know, women may know that which 
is good for them, and that which 
God requires at their hands. 

Now if we will go back on our 
lives and look over our experiences, 
right up to the present time, we will 
see, just as surely as we can see 
anything, that the power of the Holy 
Ghost has been with us, as made 



known to this people. Why are we 
here, why are we attending this con- 
ference? If we look for it, we will 
see that it is through the office work 
of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God 
that has brought us here, and to this 
point in our lives. And although the 
Hand has been invisible, almost, and 
while it has been so gentle, still it 
has led our minds, and when we 
made a choice in anything it has 
been the right choice, especially, if 
it has been dictated by this Spirit, 
and so it has brought us up to this 
point. 

Now, I feel grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, that the Lord has been 
so merciful to us. I am glad to 
know that our spirits have been 
hid with Christ to come forth in 
this day and age of the world. In- 
asmuch, as we are in this position, 
inasmuch as we have received these 
great blessings, We ought to show 
forth our appreciation of these 
things, we ought to assist in build- 
ing up this Church and kingdom. 
I tell you, my brethren and sisters, 
this latter-day work is the greatest 
thing in our lives. There is not a 
thing on earth today that stands 
anywhere near its greatness, and 
magnitude and power as does this 
Church in this world. It is wonder- 
ful, it is powerful and it should not 
be accounted by us as dross, for the 
power of God is with it and it will 
succeed. By the way, this organ- 
ization is the only thing that will 
succeed on the earth. All the or- 
ganizations of the world will go 
into oblivion ; they will pass away, 
but this organization will not pass 
away, if will go on forever ; and we 
who a're connected with it, and will 
keep connected with it, will go on 
forever. 

Men and women look sometimes 
for the sure things in life. They 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



want to be connected with the sure 
things, those things about which 
there is not a possibility of mistake 
or chance. I don't know of any- 
thing in this world that is more en- 
during than this Church, and the 
principles of the Gospel in our lives, 
and it will take us through to the 
end. This being the fact, how fool- 
ish it is for us to attach ourselves 
to anything else! There is always 
room for all our activities and pow- 
ers right here in the Church assist- 
ing to build it up, and it seems wise 
that we should not associate with 
our fellowmen in other organiza- 
tions which are inconsistent with it 
When it comes to attaching our- 
selves to organizations for safety, 
to that which will endure, there is 
nothing to compare with the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ; and we will find it out. too, 
that in a temporal way it is the 
safest institution we can be con- 
nected with, temporally as well as 
spiritually. And so we ought not 
to fritter away time and talents in 
organizations that are ephemeral, 
that are only for a time, only for 
the moment. We ought not to pay 
very much attention to such, but 
should pay our attention to and be- 
stow our talents and our powers on 
that which pertains to the kingdom, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Then if we do this, 
we shall be saved, we shall be happy. 

Are any of us feeling badly now 
because we belong to the. Church of 
Jesus Christ? I wonder if any of 
those good brethren and sisters who 
came from England, from France 
and from Germany, and from any of 
those countries where there is strife 
and turmoil, I wonder if any of 
them are feeling badly now that they 
listened to the Elders, and listened 
to the cry : "Come out of her, O ye 



my people?" I think not. As time 
goes on we shall find out that it is a 
splendid thing to be where the 
Priesthood is, and to be where the 
organization of Jesus Christ is, be- 
cause it is a place of safety, it is a 
place of refuge in the time of 
storms and calamities which are sure 
to come upon the earth. It is my 
judgment that what we are seeing 
now is only as a drop in the bucket 
to what we shall yet see in the 
world, for God has given us fore- 
warnings of trouble" and sorrow to 
come. We pray for peace and peace 
will come eventually. We pray for 
a time when there shall be a broth- 
erhood, and all shall acknowledge 
the fatherhood of God. That is not 
yet, but it is developing. It is de- 
veloping among all people, particu- 
larly Christian people, and it is 
proper to talk for peace, to pray 
for peace, because it is necessary 
when great events are to come upon 
the human family, which have been 
predicted are to come upon the 
earth, that the shadow of those 
things should be cast before. So 
it is necessary for us to talk of 
peace, that when the time comes, 
our hearts will be in a frame to ac- 
cept peace. But there is a storm 
coming before there will be a cleat- 
sky. And all we can say is, let us be 
encouraged to go on, and let us 
make this work the main thing of 
our lives, and if we want a greater 
testimony than we have, that this is 
the work of God, let us go to and 
perform the things that devolve 
upon us. Let us be honest, let us 
be truthful, let us be humble, let us 
stand ready to sustain this organiza- 
tion. , 

Let us not think that because this 
is an organization of spiritual char- 
acter that it is not to be sustained 
also in a temporal way, by temporal

things. The Lord has given us 
temporal duties to practice that we 
may become strong in that direction. 
We assist His Church and. His king- 
dom by contributing to it in its 
temporalities. Why? So that we 
may know and feel and understand 
that this is really a Church that has 
power and salvation in it. Let us 
contribute in every way we can for 
its upbuilding and its perpetuation 
in the earth. 

That we may prove true and 
faithful to the trust we have re- 
ceived ; that we may show forth our 
appreciation of these things in our 
lives ; that we may eventually re- 
ceive the benefit of a salvation in 
our Father's kingdom, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG. 

(President of Sevier Stake.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, 
[ can truly say that T never was 
more thankful to my Heavenly 
Father for the standing that I have 
at the present time in the Church of 
jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I feel that my fellowship with you 
is worth more to me than anything 
else that I can think of. I have en- 
joyed very much the remarks of 
President Keeler, and his timely in- 
structions. 

In our meeting in the Tabernacle 
this morning, every soul seemed to 
breathe a hearty response to all that 
was said by our beloved Prophet 
and President, and the prayer that 
was uttered by President Penrose, 
and commented upon by President 
Lund, showing to us the great effi- 
cacy of prayer. I was called back 
for a moment to remembrance of 
my labors in the mission field, in 



Australia. The people had suffered 
in that country from a great 
drought, until it seemed as though 
it was threatening them with star- 
vation. They called together all the 
ministers of that country, particu- 
larly in Oueensland,to a meeting in 
Brisbane, inviting all other ministers 
except the elders of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The question was asked of some of 
them why they did not extend an 
invitation to the elders of the "Mor- 
mon" Church, and they said that 
they were praying for rain, and they 
were in hopes that they would se- 
cure it, and for fear that the Lord 
would be displeased they left the 
"Mormons" out. But they did not 
get rain, to amount to anything, for 
nearly a year after that, until the 
ground became parched, dusty and 
barren, hardly a spear of grass to 
be seen. I felt so glad, so thank- 
ful, that the President of our great 
country was more thoughtful of all 
the churches, and had faith in the 
efficacy of prayer, and required this 
day to be set apart as a day of 
prayer for peace. I think it is a 
very appropriate day ; and I pre- 
sume that the Latter-day Saints as 
a whole would agree with me in this 
matter. 

As I said, I feel grateful that I 
am identified with this Church, that 
I have a standing in this Church. I 
have never seen in all my travels or 
in all my associations with men, a 
place where I need be ashamed of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ; but 
rather I have gained favor when I 
have, as Latter-day Saints should, 
borne testimony to the divinity ot 
the mission of Joseph Smith. It 
reminds me of some words of the 
poet that were quoted by one of our 
elders : 



5U 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"However the battle is ended, 

Though proudly the victories come, 
With fluttering flags and prancing 
steeds 

And the echoing roll of drum, 
Still truth proclaims the motto, 

In letters of living light, 
No question is ever settled 

Until it is settled right." 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, to 
commend such men as those who 
have contributed great sums, and 
their moral support, for the estab- 
lishment of peace, and the gathering 
of peace conventions. But I feel — 
and I have felt it more today than 
perhaps ever before — that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints should be thankful 
that they have settled the question 
right for themselves. Until the peo- 
ple of the whole world solves this 
problem, by accepting the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, the question of peace 
will never be settled right. The 
Gospel and mission of Jesus Christ 
was peace on earth, good will to 
men. It was to banish from the 
hearts of men self-aggrandizement, 
and selfishness, the desire to covet 
that which belongs to our neighbors, 
and make us possess the spirit of 
long-suffering, gentleness, kindness, 
faith and patience, that we might be 
able, not only to shun the evils of 
war, but to shun, as Paul tells us, 
the very appearance of evil. 

I wish to read a little from the 
Doctrine and Covenants, beginning 
on page 250 : 

"And again, inasmuch as parents 
have children in Zion or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach 
them not' to understand the doctrines 
of repentance, faith in Christ, the Son 
of the living God, and of baptism and 
the gift of the Holy Ghost by the lay- 
ing on of the hands when eight years 
old, the sin be upon the heads of the 
parents; for this shall be a law unto 
the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of 
her stakes which are organized; and 



their children shall be baptized for the 
remission of their sins when eight 
years old, and receive the laying on of 
the hands, and they shall also teach 
their children to pray— [which we 
heard quoted in the splendid dis- 
courses, and which were so beautifully 
illustrated in the prayers that we had 
this morning, in the supplication of 
our Heavenly Father for peace]— and 
walk uprightly before the Lord. And 
the inhabitants of Zion shall, also, ob- 
serve the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 
And the inhabitants of Zion, also, shall 
remember their labors, inasmuch as 
they are appointed to labor, in all 
faithfulness; for the idler shall be had 
in remembrance before the Lord. 
Now, I the Lord, am not well pleased 
with the inhabitants of Zion, for there 
are idlers among them. * * * * 
These things ought not to be, and 
must be done away from among them: 
wherefore, let my servant, Oliver 
Cowdery carry these sayings unto tW 
land of Zion." 

Recently T clipped an item from 
a newspaper. Tt was a comment of 
the Daily Mail, after the speech of 
Lord "Roberts, appealing to the pa- 
triotism of the men of their country. 
Tn this comment they stated that the 
people were playing, as it were, on 
the deck of a ship with the compass 
and sails, believing they were self- 
governed, while down in the hull of 
the ship was a powder magazine of 
whose existence they knew not. It 
commented on the secret diplomacv 
of their country,, stating that it 
should have no part nor portion in 
any government ; that the people 
should know and understand the 
things that are being carried on bv 
their nation. I was very much 
struck by this : that secret diplomacy 
should not and must not have any 
part, and that if Europe Avould be 
free from menace in the future they 
must follow the example of the 
United States. In reading this, my 
brethren and sisters, I have thought 
a great deal of the prophecy, where- 



ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY.

in we are told that the law should go 
out from Zion, and the word of the 
Lord from Jerusalem. Remember- 
ing that this whole land, our great 
country, is the land of Zion, here, in 
my opinion, was a suggestion in the 
right and proper direction. 

I wonder how many of us are pre- 
paring our homes, setting our homes 
in order, so that we will be able to 
have our children practice the prin- 
ciple of prayer, and observance of 
the Sabbath day, that they may 
grow up and be as a light upon a 
hill, or be as the leaven that is to 
leaven the whole lump. I believe 
that in some of the homes of the 
Latter-day Saints there is need 
for reformation, and more diligence 
should be manifest in teaching chil- 
dren the efficacy of prayer, how to 
pray and what to pray for properly, 
that they may grow up with the 
faith in the divinity of this great 
work, that they should have as Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

I trust and pray, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord will bless us, 
that we may be able to more fully 
appreciate the wonderful blessings 
that are showered out upon us in 
this goodly land where we reside, 
where the Lord has brought us, and 
that we may be able to remember 
Him in the requirements that Lie 
has made of us, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Beautiful Zion for me." 

ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 

(President of Hawaiian Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is in- 
deed refreshing to me to meet with 
you in this conference, as I have 
been away for a number of years 
from the body of the Church, labor- 
ing in what was once a foreign land, 



but which today forms a part of 
Zion. It is indeed pleasing to meet 
so many who have taken upon them- 
selves sacred covenants and obliga- 
tions to serve the Lord with all our 
might, mind and strength, and rely 
upon His promises which will not 
fail. The Lord has said, through 
His prophet, in this day and dispen- 
sation in which we live, that "I, the 
Lord, am bound when ye do as I 
say ; but when ye do not as I say, 
there is no promise." I feel that we, 
as Latter-day Saints, should take 
this to heart. We should remember 
these precious promises that have 
been made to each of us. Every soul 
in this room, and in the other vast 
congregations in conference assem- 
bled, have, if they are members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, received such a 
promise, and that promise is sure if 
we do our part. Therefore, I re- 
joice, as the brethren who have 
spoken have expressed themselves, 
more today than ever before in my 
life that I am a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ, that I have 
been called, by the servants of the 
Lord, to preach the words of life 
and salvation to a nation of people 
who have been hidden up by the 
power of God, the Eternal Father. 
Great promises have been made to 
that people, the Hawaiians, who 
have been despised because not 
properly known by but very few. 
They are a good people; they are 
of Israel, and a remnant of them 
will be saved in the kingdom of God, 
because the promises have been 
made. There are thousands who 
live in that far-off land who are true 
Latter-day Saints, true to their cove- 
nants, faithful in payment of tithes 
and offerings ; and they are a pray- 
erful people, and teach their chil- 
dren to pray.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



When the missionaries found that 
people in the year, 1820, (mission- 
aries of the Protestant denomina- 
tions), they 'found them believing in 
God, a truly prayerful people, for 
they pray in a child-like manner, 
they open their souls unto the Lord 
as little children do. I have often 
envied them in their devotion, in 
prayer, for it has seemed to me that 
they could get nearer to the Lord 
than I could. I bring greeting from 
that people to the members of the 
Church in conference assembled. 
They send their "Aloha nut ia onkou 
a pan." Many of them would love 
to gather to Zion, and I feel that 
many of them will. I hope that be- 
fore the war is poured out upon 
all nations, many of them will 
be gathered to this land of safety, 
this land of peace, where the Lord 
has promised peace. 

My heart goes out to those that 
have joined the Church in foreign 
lands, in Europe. They must 'feel 
sorry, yea, very sad to think that 
they have not gathered to Zion. 
Perhaps there are many of them 
who could not, that is not for us to 
say, but no doubt they will feel in 
their hearts to wish they were in 
Zion, a land of peace. 

I feel that we should heed the ad- 
monitions that have been given us 
as a people by the President of the 
Church, that man whom we all love, 
that we should pray, that we should 
go into our closets, our secret 
places, and there offer up our de- 
votion to God as He has directed. 
We should teach our children to 
pray, and to do what the authorities 
in the Church ask them, to honor 
and sustain those over them in au- 
thority. We who preside over mis- 
sions realize the need for this, be- 
cause we receive elders from dif- 
ferent parts of this country, from 



families who have been brought up 
under different conditions, and we 
find that some of them need to be 
taught to pray. On one occasion 
an elder told me, when I asked him 
to pray in our family devotion at 
headquarters, that that was the first 
time in his life he had knelt down 
to pray with a family. He had faith 
enough in the Church and kingdom 
of God to leave his home to go and 
preach the gospel of peace to the 
world, but it would have been bet- 
ter for him had he been taught to 
pray at home. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that young men and young women 
who are called to the mission fields 
should not try to direct the Priest- 
hood as to where they are to go, 
but let the Priesthood say. That has 
been my faith always. We ought to 
learn the little song the chorus of 
which runs something like this: 

"I will go where you want me to go, 
I will say what you want me to say, 
And will do what you want me to do. ' 

And sing it until its principle be- 
comes part of us. If our young 
men and our young women learned 
this, and really realized it in their 
hearts and in their souls, they would 
say to the brethren who called them 
to go to the nations of the earth, 
wheresoever it might be, "I will 
go where you want me to go ; I will 
do what you want me to do, and I 
will say what you want me to say, 
by the help of Him who rules on 
high. .We ought to do this, because 
we would then go feeling in our 
hearts that we were just where the 
Lord wants us to be. I have 
never known in my life an 
instance of the Lord making any 
mistakes, or of the brethren who 
were called to preside making mis-

takes when guided by the influence 
of the Holy Ghost. It is the right 
and privilege of all to be guided 
by that influence, because it has been 
conferred upon us for that especial 
purpose. I feel that we Latter-day 
Saints ought to be faithful, and ap- 
preciative of the goodness and bless- 
ings of our Father. 

I thought, while President Smith 
was saying this morning that none 
of us could make a blade of grass 
grow without the power of God, 
how true it is that "Paul may plant 
and Apollos may water, but God 
giveth the increase." Let us have 
complete faith in God who gives the 
increase, and that He is at the helm, 
guiding all things. 

This work will go on, brethren 
and sisters, I have no doubt of it ; 
the only doubt I have is in my abil- 
ity to prove faithful under all con- 
ditions. I want to be faithful; I 
want to be true ; I want to be loyal 
to the Priesthood ; I want to be 
loyal to the work of God in every 
particular, and I want to do my duty 
faithfully and well. 

Now I believe that we have, as I 
have said, a good people clown in 
Hawaii, there are not very many of 
us — a little over 8,000 souls that be- 
long to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. There are 
other thousands who have belonged 
to the Church and have passed to 
the other side, who will need to 
have ordinance work done 'for them 
in- the temples. I am trying to en- 
courage those who are faithful to 
see to it that they gather their gene- 
alogies. It is going to be a difficult 
task, because those people do not 
take the name of the parent as we 
do ; a man might be called John, and 
that would be the only name he 
would be known by, and his father's 
name Samuel, only; furnishing no 



clue in names as to parenthood, ex- 
cept so far as their recollection goes. 
It appears to me that, after a while, 
the Lord will have to reveal many 
things pertaining to that good peo- 
ple, because of the promises that He 
has made through His prophets. 

You will remember reading,' in 
the Book of Mormon, of the prom- 
ise made to Joseph, the son of Lehi, 
that a remnant of his seed should 
be preserved, and they would re- 
ceive the Gospel. And then we read 
of one Hagaoth, a Nephite ship 
builder, who builded a large ship 
and took emigrants of the Nephites 
to the north, then he came back and 
builded other ships, and some of 
those were lost and driven away, 
and whether they sank in the mighty 
deep or were drifted to other lands, 
the writer says he knows not. But 
we believe, through tracing their 
genealogies, traditions and legends, 
that they are of that people who 
were lost, the Nephites that were 
migrating to the north, and that 
they drifted off to Hawaii-. The na- 
tural currents of the ocean teach us 
that. 

1 have a glass bottle in my office, 
at the mission headquarters, that 
was picked up on the shore of Laie, 
upon the island of Oahu. That bot- 
tle was thrown overboard from a 
vessel, north of San Francisco, and 
it contained documents giving the 
date, the latitude and longitude, the 
name of the vessel and the name of 
the captain of the ship from which 
it was thrown. How long this bot- 
tle had lain upon the sands of the sea 
shore we do not know, but we know 
that it was found, and we know that 
not so very long a time elapsed be- 
tween the throwing of this bottle 
into the sea, containing the informa- 
tion that I have named sealed within 
it, until it was picked up on the

shore at Laie a place familiar to all 
the elders and sisters who have la- 
bored in the islands of Hawaii. 

Laie used to be a city of refuge 
in the days of the old kings, and it 
is now a city of refuge for the Saints 
living in that land, a gathering- 
place. The servants of the Lord, the 
committee chosen to select a gath- 
ering place for the Saints of that 
mission, one of whom was our be- 
loved President Joseph F. Smith, 
had the land shown in vision to 
them, and they reported the same to 
President Young, who authorized 
the purchase of the land, and since 
then it has been owned by the 
Church. It is a beautiful place. We 
are trying to build it up, and make it 
a city of refuge indeed for that peo- 
ple, where they can be cared for. I 
feel that the time has come when we 
need to have them gather together 
more than heretofore. They are be- 
ing oppressed, and their lands are 
being bought by other people, and 
many of them are left homeless, so 
to speak. * We need to teach them 
to cultivate the soil more than they 
have done before. The spirit to 
plant and to cultivate has come over 
them ; and there will be a market 
for everything they can raise, be- 
cause of the large number of 
United States troops located upon 
that island ; and also that they may 
have something in time of famine 
to feed the needy. We are trying 
to teach them to' save foodstuffs, 
that they may be prepared for a 
time when they will need it, as we 
have been taught, not only to pro- 
vide for our spiritual welfare but 
for our temporal wants also. 

Now I pray the Lord to bless this 
people, to bless all Israel, to bless 
al our missions in the earth, and 
all the elders and sisters who go out 
to preach peace and good will to 



gather Israel and to bring them 
home to Zion, where they may 
escape the judgments that are to be 
poured out upon those who will not 
repent. 

May the Lord bless the people 
here in Zion, and help us to ap- 
preciate these beautiful valleys, and 
mountains of ours, and what the 
Lord has done and will do for us, 
if we are faithful ; and that He will 
finally save us all in His kingdom, 
with the redeemed and sanctified, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON. 

(President of Uintah Stake.) 

I think it is Winston Churchill, 
in his rather remarkable book "In- 
side of the Cup" that says: "The 
test of any doctrine is whether or 
not it can be translated into life, 
whether it will make those better 
who believe and obey it." This 
quotation and thought has come to 
me this day in listening to the re- 
marks of my brethren. In the same 
book the same author puts it into 
the mouth of one of his characters 
to say, in speaking to a minister of 
the gospel: "O if you only knew 
the yearning that exists in this great 
city for a religion that will satisfy 
the soul !" These two quotations 
have come to me, I say, during the 
day. and I am so grateful that, so 
far as my soul is concerned, the re- 
ligion of Jesus Christ, as I under- 
stand it, satisfies. And more than 
that, I am willing that this test, 
as to whether or not this doctrine 
may be translated into life, may be 
made in the case of the members 
of the Church. To me one of the 
greatest evidences that the doctrines 
of the Church are translated into 
life, yea indeed become life itself. 



ELDER DON B. COLTON.

is the fact that out of every land 
and clime have been gathered peo- 
ple with various thoughts of life, 
with various habits of life. 

From the southern parts of Eur- 
ope, the Slavs have been gathered ; 
from the Central, the Teutons ; 
from the north, the Saxons and the 
Britons and various peoples from 
the islands of the sea, and they have 
become one homegenious whole, 
welded together by a power that 
is a marvel to many people who 
make a study of the Church. 
"Translated into life." These 
doctrines are life to the members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. They have 
brought our people from foreign 
lands, many from scenes of poverty. 
The elders have gone forth preach- 
ing this word among the poor, the 
poor have been gathered here to this 
goodly land. These people who have 
received the Gospel have made good 
homes, they have reared good fam- 
ilies. They have sent their sons 
back to the land of their forefathers 
as missionaries ; and what wonder- 
ful changes one generation has 
wrought in the lives of the people. 

Young men are called from var- 
ious walks of life, from the farm, 
from the store, from the school- 
room, and from the various profes- 
sions, that go out humbly, yet will- 
ing to receive the impressions and 
willing to work, and they have be- 
come valiant and courageous and 
able defenders of God's work. They 
become men who are not afraid to 
meet the learned of the earth and 
talk to them upon the principles of 
the Gospel. Have these doctrines 
been translated into life? Look 
again. See a man as' he is in his 
native place, often in wickedness, 
turn and in the face of the world 
embrace this Gospel with sincere 



soul, turn around and become a 
good, honest, God-fearing man. I 
have known of the influences of the 
Gospel to take hold of young men 
while riding upon the range, and 
have melted them to tears. Ther 
would get off their horses and ask 
God's forgjiveness. The light of 
the Gospel has come into their souls, 
and they have been .better, aye, a 
thousand times better, for the Spirit 
and power of God that has come to 
them when they have put their soul.^ 
in a condition to receive the Gospel 
and its benefit and light. It ha.^ 
impressed itself upon our boys to 
go to school, because they have 
learned that the glory of God is in- 
telligence, and that a man cannot be 
saved in ignorance. Therefore, all 
over the land, and all over the 
Church, young men and young wo^ 
men are filled with a desire to learn, 
to know, to become better, to feel 
what there is in life itself. They 
have learned to feel life, to know 
what life is, by seeing and feeling 
the brighter life translated into their 
lives ; it has become part of their 
very lives, through the Gospel. 

Does it satisfy the soul? Ask 
these men who have gathered from 
those lands and made homes among 
the happy people who are true to the 
Church. Ask them if they are satis- 
fied, and they will answer. Yes, I 
am thankful to God that out in the 
world I heard this word ; I heard 
and embraced it. Satisfied? They 
never knew happiness until this mes- 
sage came to them. Ask the boy who 
wants to study. Ask him who wants 
to g'et into the mysteries of life, are 
you satisfied? To him this life is 
not what Ingersoll said it was '"A 
narrow vale between two cold and 
barren peaks of eternity." No, it 
is not so with a man who comes in 
and studies this Gospel. Tt is an 



56

explanation to him of life before he 
came here, of life here and of life 
hereafter. No depth, no height, no 
width to which he may not go in the 
study of the problems of life. There 
are things revealed, light revealed 
sufficient to satisfy the most learned 
student, who with prayerful heart 
goes in and asks God to unlock to 
him the mysteries of the life here- 
after, as well as life before coming 
here. 

Ask the man or the woman who is 
called to part with a loved one, with 
a child, for instance. I have seen 
it; you have seen it, my brethren. 
You have been called, and vou have 
gone to administer to the sick. We 
have seen the sick, in dozens of in- 
stances, praise God that His power 
is manifest in the Church. At times, 
it is true. God has called home our 
loved ones, and still are we satis- 
fied. You and I have witnessed it. 
I have myself gone into the homes 
where death has come, and I have 
seen broken-hearted — may I say 
that — at least sorrowful fathers and 
mothers, weeping over the bier of 
their children, but they have looked 
up through their tears, and said : "I 
thank God, for I know my child still 
lives, and though God has taken him 
or her from me, they still live, and 
the Lord liveth and the Lord giveth 
and the Lord taketh away, and 
blessed be the name of the Lord." 
Where else can you find such satis- 
faction? Where else can you find 
such true happiness? Where else 
can you go to find the soul-satis- 
tion that you can find in the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ? And if this au- 
thor's test is a true one, if this work 
is to be judged and measured by its 
power to be translated into the lives 
of its people, or if it is to be meas- 
ured by its power to satisfy the soul. 



we say that the requirements are 
met. 

Now, in conclusion, one thought 
— the satisfaction that comes to me 
and to you, in this work to impart 
strength. The strength of the Gos- 
pel lies in this truth, that I have the 
right to know for myself whether 
this work is true or not. I have a 
right to have my soul satisfied along 
this line. So have you. And the 
strength of this work, I repeat, lies 
in the fact that all men may know 
God and know of this doctrine ; that 
out in the Stakes of Zion, all over 
the world where the Gospel is 
preached, men and women rise up 
and declare, in words of soberness, 
that they know that this work is 
true, that God has revealed it to 
them. We sustain the authorities of 
the Church, not because we know 
them personally, but because God 
has called them to positions which 
they occupy, and we know it. We 
know this work is true, and there- 
fore we sustain and uphold them. 

God bless us all, that the testi- 
mony of the 'truth may be with us 
and make our hearts rejoice. I feel 
sure in my knowledge of the glori- 
ous truths God has revealed, and 
may we all feel that into our lives 
are translated the glorious truths of 
the Gospel, that we shall show the 
effect of that translation by our con- 
duct, in just and true and pure lives, 
and if we shall do it, the results will 
follow, and our souls will be satis- 
fied. God bess us to this end, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

As the dew, from heaven distilling, 
Gently on the grass descends, 

And revives it, thus fulfilling 
What Thy providence intends.

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

I bring you greetings, my breth- 
ren and sisters and 'friends, from the 
California mission, and am happy to 
tell you that everything is propitious 
there for the work of the Lord, your 
fathers and husbands, your sons and 
brothers are doing good service in 
the Master's cause. 

With the brethren who have pre- 
ceded me, I appreciate, as I know 
every Latter-day Saint does, the 
fact .that they are members of the 
Church of Christ, and citizens of 
Zion. Our songs and most of the 
talk this day has been in praise of 
the fact, or stating the fact, that 
this is the land of Zion, the land of 
peace. You who are familiar with 
holy writ know that this land has 
been hidden away from the ken of 
man, a choice and a chosen land for 
Joseph and his seed, who was sep- 
arated from his brethren; and that 
the Gentiles who should come to this 
land, and acknowledge Christ as 
king and Lord, should be great in 
the eyes of the Omnipotent One, and 
that He would care for them and 
provide for them. He would fight 
their battles. All who would come 
up against Zion, white or black, 
bond or free, should perish, and 
those who would seek to set up a 
kingdom here should have their 
schemes brought to naught, and 
should signally fail ; even those who 
should strive from afar to set up 
kings upon this land should likewise 
perish. This land, if the testimony 
of the greatest of our scientists be 
true, was hoary with age when 
Egypt was in her swaddling bands : 
First of the continents to thrust its 
head above the waters, and first to 
pierce the sky with its mountains, 
was this glad land of America. 



Just now, almost within the con- 
fines of the City of the Angels, 
in California, is the greatest archae- 
ololical find known to modern times. 
Bones are being disinterred there 
that, in the mind of the scientist 
and paleontologist, have determined 
the fact that here on this western 
hemisphere life began, both that of 
the beast of the field, the fowl of the 
air and of human kind. Elephants 
of huge and ponderous size, camels, 
horses, tigers, lions (greater than 
any known to modern times, and 
estimated to be 250,000 years old), 
the greatest bear known to history, 
the greatest wolf, the greatest bird 
of prey, have all been disinterred in 
the oil pits of Lake La Brea, on the 
western confines or city limits of 
Los Angeles. The skeleton of a 
woman head downward, also sup- 
posed to be at least ten thousand 
years old, was found there. Whether 
she was thrown headlong into the 
pit of tar by angry spouse or a dis- 
gruntled lover, or whether she fell 
in while plaiting her hair before the 
lake as a mirror, is not known. 
But these things have gone to de- 
termine in the minds of men that 
America was the home of the hu- 
man race, and the home where God 
first set His creatures free. From 
this land, Maya tradition tells us, as 
told by Le Plongeon, in his "Queen 
Moo" civilization was taken to 
Egypt. This was possibly by 
Egyptus — as recorded in the Pearl 
of Great Price, and the riddle is 
thus solved where Egypt and Egyp- 
tions obtained their civilization, and 
the wondrous knowledge of astron- 
omy, of surveying, of agriculture, of 
medicine, etc., it came from Amer- 
ica, the land from whence Noah 
sailed when he with his family em- 
barked in the ark, when the waters 
of the great deep were broken up 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and the lands both of the old and 
the new world, so called, were in- 
undated. This hidden land of Jo- 
seph, seen only in transient vision, 
perchance, sometimes, as by Isaiah, 
when he looked across the sands 
of Sahara, beyond the gates of the 
Mediterranean Sea, and cried out : 
''Woe! to the land shadowing with 
wings, which is beyond the rivers of 
Ethiopia;" and beheld that there 
should be gathered the elect of God's 
people in the last days, that there 
should His house be set up, and 
here should men learn of His ways 
and walk in His paths, as has been 
stated today, that "the law should 
go forth of Zion and the word of 
the Lord from Jerusalem." If we 
needed evidence of the fulfillment 
of that part of this prophecy, we 
only need look at what is done today 
by the great nations striving for 
supremacy yet appealing to Amer- 
ica for recognition, each one plead- 
ing to America to acknowledge the 
integrity and honor of their purpose 
in war, and to defend them through 
pubiic opinion. We find ag^ain a 
testimony in the Monroe doctrine, 
which determined the policy of the 
states of America, that there should 
be no intervention come from 
abroad, that this land in its auto- 
nomy and integrity should be pre- 
served by the government of the 
United States, founded under God 
and His inspiration for the establish- 
ment of liberty and conserving the 
rights of men, "nobly defended by 
the blood of our fathers," and 
prayed for in the revelation prayer 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
for the dedication of the Kirtland 
Temple, that "it should stand for 
ever." 

A vindication of the promise that 
T quoted from the Book of Mormon 
relative to kings is found in the his- 



tory, most melancholy, indeed, of 
Maximilian, one time a prince of 
Austria, who sought to set himself 
up as Emperor of Mexico. You 
know his sad fate (executed at the 
hands of the native forces of Mex- 
ico) perchance better than you do 
the fate of his loving and charming 
wife, Carlotta, who after all her 
vicissitudes of fortune which vainly 
seeking to bolster up the kingdom of 
her husband by European powers, is 
still an inmate of an insane asylum. 
Louis Napoleon, who refused to 
withdraw his troops, when England 
and Spain did upon the protest of 
the United States. At that time this 
country was unable to use its forces 
against those armies for the reason 
that we were engaged in a 'fratrici- 
dal war, foretold by the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith many years before it 
came about, and from which time 
war should be poured out upon all 
nations. 'Twas then our countrv 
received its baptism of fire. At that 
time those two nations withdrew 
their forces. France persisted 
against our protest. What became 
of Louis III who sought to establish 
a king here? He became an exile 
to England, where he died, and his 
only son, Prince Bonaparte enlisted 
in a British regiment was ambushed 
and killed by the Zulus in South 
Africa. 

Again in the house of Portugal. 
John VI, went to Rio Janeiro with 
his court and set up his son as em- 
peror of Brazil, from which country 
he governed Portugal. In the early 
part of the 19th century, he returned 
to Portugal in a mad effort to over- 
come conditions there and establish 
his house firmly in that land but died 
broken-hearted. Dom Pedro, of 
Brazil, found his reign a tempestu- 
ous one, and abdicated in favor of 
his own son, who afterwards himself 



ELDERJOSEPH E. ROBINSON 



59 



was glad to flee the land, when a 
republic was instituted. Portugal 
has seen, or we have seen, the ful- 
fillment of God's promises relative 
to the fate of the house of John — 
the assassination of Don Carlos and 
his brother and the exile of his 
brother, Manuelo, who now is a ref- 
ugee in England, without a country 
and without a home that he can claim 
as his own. The same condition ob- 
tained when Antone Creile would 
have set up a kingdom in Chile, and 
made his daughter the "richest wo- 
man of Europe." Put to death, in 
an uprising of the denizens of that 
state, he perished, and his daughter, 
broken-hearted, withdrew herself 
from the courts that she had graced 
with her smiles and her riches, and 
retired to Copenhagen, and three 
years ago, died in penury and was 
buried in the Potter's field. God has 
kept His promise relative to this 
land of Zion. And as I recognize 
that the Lord has kept the other 
promises He has made, we may read 
the signs of the times and know 
that the Lord will fight the battles of 
this land just so long as the people 
of this loved country of ours shall 
acknowledge Christ as Lord and He 
shall be their king. 

It was the note of John Hay, 
Secretary of State, that determined 
the outcome of the Russo-Japanese 
war before it was fought. He de- 
clared for the integrity of China and 
her autonomy, the withdrawal of the 
Russian forces and that the ports 
of that empire should be open to the 
commerce of the world. "It stag- 
gered the diplomats of the world for 
a brief instant, the Kaiser of Ger- 
many and the King of England, ob- 
jected, but it was not long, three 
days at the farthest, I think, until 
they themselves repeated the Hay- 
note, and declared it for their policy. 



which is again, an example of the 
"law going forth from Zion" and 
having a radical and vital force in 
the affairs of the nations of the 
earth. 

We have exercised a protectorate 
over some of the islands of the Pa- 
cific, as well as bringing Hawaii into 
Zion, as mentioned by Brother 
Woolley. We have exercised a pro- 
tectorate over some of the West 
India islands, and the beneficient in- 
fluence of this country, guaranteed 
by the constitution framed by our 
fathers, under the inspiration of God, 
must be recognized by the great na- 
tions of the earth. Verily, saith the 
Lord, as it written in the scriptures 
that shall be published by the people 
in this land of Joseph, the law they 
have of God shall find place in the 
hearts of men, they shall acknowl- 
edge the Christ as their king, they 
shall bow their knee and pay hom- 
age to Him, and His words shall go 
forth in power among the nations 
of men until all shall know the Lord, 
and "there shall be no need for one 
man to ask' another, Knowest thou 
the Lord ? but every man shall know 
Him from the greatest unto the 
least." Then men, having become 
sickened with war and bloodshed, 
and famine, and rapine and plunder, 
shall turn themselves away from it, 
and learn the arts of peace, of in- 
dustry, and walk in the ways of 
righteousness, and the millennium 
shall have dawned, and Christ shall 
have begun His reign for ever with 
His Saints. God hasten the day, I 
ask it, in Christ's name. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Gospel Restoration." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder William N. Williams.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

A meeting was held in front of 
the Bureau of Information, at 2 
p. m. Elder Benjamin Goddard 
presided, and the 20th Ward choir, 
conducted by David J. Watts, fur- 
nished the music. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad 
morning, 

Joy to the lands that in darkness have 
lain ! 

Hushed be the accents of sorrow and 
mourning, 
Zion in triumph begins her glad reign. 

Prayer was offered by Patriarch 
William Jex. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Behold, the mountain of the Lord 

In latter days shall rise, 
On mountain tops, above the hills, 

And draw the wond'ring eyes. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Sup't Bureau of Information.) 

Brethren and Sisters': We are 
very glad to welcome you all to 
this meeting. We realize that you 
may feel tired before the close, but 
the brethren whe will addiess you 
are interesting speakers, and I be- 
speak for them your faith and 
prayers. There may be a little con- 
fusion while people are passing by, 
but I am quite sure that most of you 
will be satisfied to stay to the end 
of the service, at least we hope so. 

I will refer very briefly to one or 
two items that may interest you. 
First, I direct your attention to the 
sterling character of the "Mormon" 
people, in contrast with prevailing 
views in some parts of the civilized 
world. I introduced to you, for the 
opening prayer, Elder William [ex. 



a patriarch of the Church, from 
Nebo Stake. I desire to say that 
he is in very deed, -a patriarch. We 
compliment him upon this sacred 
calling. We commend all Israel for 
their desire to raise families of 
children that shall be an honor unto 
God's cause. 

Brother Jex and his good wife, 
now in their declining years, have 
been exceedingly blessed. Here is 
their family photo (showing it) 
and I venture to say that there are 
few communities outside of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints that can produce an 
equal record. This aged patriarch 
and his wife have a posterity of over 
two hundred souls, and all are good 
faithful members of the Church, 
and a credit to any community ; and 
mark you, this is a monogamous 
family. 

It is well to be familiar with such 
a record, at a time, especially, when 
there appears a desire on the part 
of some women to limit the size of 
their families. We commend all 
such people as Patriarch Jex and his 
wife for God has elected that spirits 
shall come from the eternal world 
and, when they come through such a 
lineage, they are fortunate "indeed. 

I desire also to read to you the 
last hymn sung by the choir, as we 
observe that many of you do not 
have hymn books. Probably some 
of you did not hear the words dis- 
tinctly and they are too good to pass 
by lightly, especially in view of -the 
conditions now prevailing abroad, 
and that have been referred to so 
often during this conference. The 
sentiments will appeal strongly to 
all Latter-day Saints, for the verses 
breathe the spirit of prophecy, and 
contain a sermon well worth con- 
sideration. 



ELDER MELVIN 1. BALLARD. 



61 



The words of the hymn, which 
the choir sang so sweetly, are as 
follows : 

"Behold the Mountain of the Lord 

In latter-days shall rise, 
On mountain tops, above the hills, 

And draw the wond'ring eyes. 

To this the joyful nations round, 
All tribes and tongues, shall flow: . 

"Up to the hill of God," they'll say 
And to His house, we'll go." 

The rays that shine from Zion's hill 

Shall lighten every land; 
The King who reigns in Salem's tow- 
ers 

Shall all the world, command. 

Among the nations He shall judge, 
His judgments truth shall guide, 

His sceptre shall protect the just; 
And quell the sinner's pride. 

No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds 

Disturb those peaceful years; 
To plowshares men shall beat their 
swords, 

To pruning-hooks their spears. 

No longer host, encountering host, 
Shall crowds of slain deplore; 

They'll hang the trumpet in the hall 
And study war no more. 

Come, then, O house of Jacob, come, 

To worship at His shrine, 
And, walking in the light of God, 

With holy beauties shine. 

I think you will join in the 
prayers that have been offered this 
day, that God will hasten the time 
when these prophecies shall be truly 
fulfilled, and I commend these 
thoughts to you, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

To me this is a momentous day 
in the history, not only of modern 
Israel, but the world. Never since 
the year 1820, when the Prophet 



Joseph received in answer to his in- 
quiry, which of all the churches was 
right, has the divine statement of 
the Lord Jesus, that all denomina- 
tions had departed from the truth, 
that they had the form of godliness, 
but not the power thereof, and that 
he should not affiliate with any of 
them, witnessed a day more fruit- 
ful in evidence of the truthfulness 
of that statement than today. A 
summary of the changing of the 
creeds of the various religious de- 
nominations from the year 1820 
would convince any reasonable- 
minded person that the Lord told 
the truth, and that out of the sev- 
eral denominations has there been a 
revolution of religious thought and 
doctrine, faith and belief, until the 
man or woman who was orthodox 
in the year 1820 if he or she enter- 
tained the same views today, would 
be considered guilty of heresy. Such 
have been the wonderful changes. 
But these changes perhaps have 
been so slow, that even to our minds 
we have not fully appreciated what 
it all means. And to the world the 
changes may have been so slow that 
the world has not observed any 
change at all. But this day, this 
year, is fruitful with new evidence 
of the truthfulness of that state- 
ment. And as I listened to the re- 
marks of our President, this 
morning, in reference to the great 
disturbances that interest us all, 
and the balance of the world, 1 
found in this very thing a literal, an 
absolute and a complete fulfilment 
of the words of the Master when 
He said: "They have the form of 
godliness, but not the power 
thereof." 

When we realize that from a 
thousand altars in Austria there 
are going up this day prayers^to 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the same God whom the French 
worship, the Russians, the English, 
and all Christian men are paying 
their devotion to; that up from 
these Catholic altars of Austria 
(and Austria stands as one of the 
strong nations of the world rep- 
resenting the great Roman Catholic 
Church), that from these altars 
are rising prayers to God for 
strength that the Austrian soldiers 
may repel their brothers of the 
Greek Catholic Church, who sweep 
down upon them in mighty force 
from Russia, the strong quarters of 
that other great faction of the 
Christian religion, the Greek 
Catholic Church. And then over 
in Germany, the headquarters of 
Protestantism, at least where Pro- 
testantism was born, where it has 
been protected and thrived, the 
same prayers are being offered for 
power to destroy the Christian 
brethren of another nation. Like- 
wise in France, where there are a 
mixture of Protestants and Cath- 
olics, prayers are ascending for the 
success of the armies of the allies. 
And in England, the headquarters 
of another faction of Protestantism, 
the mighty Episcopal, or English 
Church, there are ascending similar 
prayers; so that well nigh all fac- 
tions, or at least the great major- 
ity, of Christianity is represented 
in these mighty nations who are in 
this terrific struggle. And I have 
thought of what I have read during 
the last few weeks, questions that 
have been ringing through all the 
leading magazines, periodicals, and 
from the pulpits of the great re- 
ligious denominations, "Has Chris- 
tianity then, broken down, and has 
it failed ? After two thousand years, 
is this the fruit of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ ?" I discover that there 
are many men and women losing 



their faith. They are beginning to 
question if there is ?. God ; if there 
is a God of the Christian religion, 
where is He? If there is a God, 
why has He deserted us ? Why does 
He not speak ? Why does He re- . 
main silent and witness the slaugh- 
ter and destruction of countless 
thousands of innocent men daily? 

It is a good time for us to begin 
to observe if we have allowed our- 
selves to grow careless and indif- 
ferent. Have we read the signs of 
the times to observe what God 
means, that He is speaking, is exer- 
cising control among the destinies 
of the nations? What does all this 
mean ? There is no reason why the 
Latter-day Saints should be in the 
dark, in view of the light, in view 
of the truth that has come into the 
world. All this spells something to 
the Latter-day Saints, the fulfilment 
of ancient and modern prophecy, 
and the fulfilment of the truth of 
the utterance made by the Lord 
Jesus when He said that all the re- 
ligions of the world, although claim- 
ing to be His, had but the form of 
godliness, but lacked the power 
thereof. What has become of the 
vital power of Christianity that 
would convert pagan men, teach 
them to love God, to love their 
brethren, to learn to control their 
own feelings and desires, master 
their tempers and their passions so 
that they might when smitten on the 
one cheek turn the other, if sued for 
their coat, give their cloak also? 
What has become of the religion 
that would produce these fruits? 
Anciently it was possible to discover 
among the Christian men and 
women who accepted the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, fruits of this charac- 
ter, men who could willingly, cheer- 
fully face death itself without mur- 
muring, without resenting, leaving 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

vengeance in the hands of God. I 
proclaim to you my brethren and 
sisters, that in thunder tones, there 
is ringing forth over the world the 
evidence that Christianity is not the 
vital Gospel, nor has it the power 
and force that Jesus Christ endowed 
it with in the beginning. I do not 
speak; of this to rejoice over the 
weakness or the failures of my 
brothers of other Christian denom- 
inations, who are struggling against 
great odds, trying to make the re- 
ligion of itself effective. I sorrow 
for them ; I do not rejoice at their 
failures. I grieve, because among 
them are thousands of honest work- 
ers who are handicapped because 
they do not have the truth ; and 
from this day forward their strug- 
gle will be a struggle against great 
odds, because there will be thrown 
in the face of all appeals for men 
to be Christians, the present failure 
of Christianity to mellow the hearts 
of men, to soften them towards 
their fellows. 

Perhaps there is no war that has 
been waged in the world, of any 
consequence that had so little ex- 
cuse for its existence as this war; 
and yet it comes after these hun- 
dreds of years of preaching of the 
( rospel of Peace. There is a form 
of godliness over Belgium, Ger- 
many, France, Russia and other na- 
tions. There are evidences of a 
form of godliness in the thousands 
of church towers that rise to the 
skies, but I regret to say that the 
evidence of the Christianity of the 
men and women of these nations is 
lacking, as shown by their eager- 
ness to fly at each other's throats 
with all the venom and greediness 
for blood and destruction ever ex- 
hibited by pagan nations. And so, 
my brethren and sisters, you men 
who have been in the world preach- 



ing the restoration of the Everlast- 
ing Gospel, if you have lifted up 
your voice long and loud proclaim- 
ing this truth, if you have sought 
and endeavored in your lives to live 
so that your lives would proclaim 
the restoration of the whole power, 
the whole truth with all of its vital 
force, if you have done this in the 
past, there is every evidence and 
more reason why you should do it 
more earnestly, more devotedly to- 
day than ever you have done be- 
fore. 

A few years ago a Christian min- 
ister in the State of Montana, a sec- 
tion of our mission, had his eyes 
opened, and strange to say, this is a 
day when so many men, having eyes 
see not ; ears, they hear not, and 
hearts, they do not understand, and 
are blunted to the truth; but here 
and there men catch glimpses of the 
real situation and are fearless 
enough to proclaim it. And when 
I read these striking words from 
this Christian minister it impressed 
me, and today his declaration sounds 
nearer the truth, and rings more 
strikingly . than it did a few years 
ago. He asks : 

"Is the church anything but a mere 
social organization? Is the Christian- 
ity of today the true doctrine of the 
Christ of the Bible? Has the so-called 
Christianity of today anything in it 
that ought to attract more than any 
other creed that is supposed to help 
humanity? The Christian community 
of the present is loud in its claims of 
Vast conquest and remarkable vic- 
tories. We are invited to see its ac- 
quired wealth, its tremendous expan- 
sion and to hear the clang of its 
enormous and intricate machinery. But 
with all of this, I maintain that the 
Christianity of the present is face to 
face with a lamentable loss. The Chris- 
tianity of today has acquired much, 
but in its getting it has lost its own 
soul. There are periods in the Chris- 
tian era we look back upon with won-

der and admiration. In those days 
men were convicted of sin and a judg- 
ment to come. Then the more than 
human element was visible in our 
creed. Holy men had heavenly visions. 
Sickness was cured by spiritual power. 
The dead were raised. Holy men spoke 
with other tongues as the Spirit gave 
them utterance. Prison doors were 
opened and Ananias and Saophira fell 
fifeless at the Apostles' feet for play- 
ing with 1 this power. Is the spiritual 
element that so characterized those 
days an ancient relic of something 
worn out like a garment? The com- 
mission to the early Christian teachers 
was that they must be imbued with 
oower from on high and then go and 
baptize all nations in the name of the 
Father and the Son and the Holy 
Ghost, and that power was always 
manifested when they performed the 
deed. 

The Christian religion of the present 
is merely a social code and has noth- 
ing in it whereby it' could claim a di- 
vine origin. It is truly pitiable to be- 
hold the church religion of today try- 
ing to save this sinful world. We have 
lost our magnet. The Christ who said 
He would draw all men to Him if He 
was lifted up, is disobeyed and ignored 
in the multiplicity of our present 
church life. Since we have presented 
many substitutes in the world for gen- 
uine spiritual power, they are of no 
more value in the saving of the sinner 
than an artificial heart would be in 
pumping blood through the arteries. 

\ are like men trying to run an en- 
gine without steam. 

The church of today is the church 
of man, not the church of God. I pre- 
dict its crashing to pieces like a ship 
on the rocks before a heavy sea, in the 
nearby years, unless there is a mighty 
turning to God in our ranks. 

T think these extracts from this 
minister of the Methodist Church 
is one of the evidences from the 
outside, that the Lord Jesus told 
the truth to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in the year 1820, and I say- 
that this year is bringing forth the 
best evidence that has ever been 
produced to prove it. When I want 
to judge the world, as I now say 



they ought to be judged, by their 
fruits, to demonstrate whether or 
not they have indeed the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, I feel that 
"Mormonism," so-called, or the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as 
proclaimed by the Latter-day Saints, 
ought to stand the same test. In ap- 
plying that test, I will ask you, is it 
possible that there has been pro- 
duced a community of people, gath- 
ered from all nations of the earth, a 
race of men and women, wrio, in 
their lives are demonstrating that 
they are producing the fruits of the 
Gospel of peace and of good-will to- 
wards their fellow men, and that 
they are not chargeable with the 
things that we charge against the 
Christian denominations? Looking 
back in a short and brief glance over 
the history of the past, there come 
distinctly to our minds the severe 
trials through which the Latter-day 
Saints have passed, giving them 
the opportunity to demonstrate 
whether or nor they could resist 
the natural inclinations of the. flesh 
to fight and retaliate, an eye for an 
eye, a tooth for a tooth. Go back 
to the days of Illinois, back to the 
days of Missouri, when they were 
expelled from Jackson County, 
when they were expelled ultimately 
from the State of Missouri, or at 
the period when the prophet was 
taken and unjustly imprisoned and 
foully murdered in Carthage jail in 
the State of Illinois. Notwith- 
standing the Latter-day Saints were 
in great numbers in Nauvoo, and 
Carthage had but two thousand 
souls, was there a spirit of murder 
in their. hearts or of retaliation? 

I remember on a visit to the city 
of Carthage of meeting a man, now 
an old gentleman, who was a wit- 
ness of the martyrdom of the 
prophet. He said that, returning 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

from hauling away from the City of 
Carthage the records of the county, 
for fear the "Mormons" would 
come down to Carthage and destroy 
them, he met men, women and chil- 
dren fleeing in every direction, fear- 
ing the wrath of the "Mormons." 
That when he arrived in Carthage 
he said, there were about six fam- 
ilies remaining in the city; all had 
fled. ("The wicked flee when no 
man pursueth.") It was feared the 
•Mormons" would come. It was 
known that just provocation had 
been raised, and if they did take 
vengeance in their own hands and 
come down to mete out justice, it 
would have been only the ordinary 
course of events. And then the next 
night he was permitted to go with 
his iather and others towards Nau- 
voo with the bodies of the Prophet 
Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and he 
said : "We met the '.Mormons/ but 
they were not carrying arms. We 
met them, twenty thousand of them, 
lining the street leading out from 
Nauvoo to Carthage, with their 
heads uncovered, weeping for the 
loss of their dead, and murmuring 
all along the way the words : 'Ven- 
geance is God's he will repay'." 
' I assert that all through our ex- 
istence we have said "Vengeance is 
the Lord's, He will repay." _ And 
there has been born and bred in our 
spirit, as young men and young 
women, the disposition to train 
our impulsive souls. When we 
go into the mission field and 
have the door slammed in our 
faces, are insulted and abused, we 
have been taught by the spirit of 
the Gospel to go by ourselves and 
say : "Father, forgive them, for they 
know not what they do." We have 
been led to love them, though they 
hate us. 

I have never seen among the min- 



istry, or among men of the world, 
evidence of the power of the Lord 
Jesus Christ to love your enemies, 
as exhibited in the lives of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Our fathers and 
mothers have set a splendid exam- 
ple to the young men and young 
women of this Church; and inas- 
much as the struggle is not ended, 
and the battle is yet on, I appeal to 
you, that the day is coming when 
you shall be given a grand oppor- 
tunity of exhibiting and displaying 
before the world the fortitude and 
the power there is in the restored 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. Not from 
your public sermons, not from the 
publication of your word and mes- 
sage, but from your lives shall arise 
evidences to convince men of the 
truth. And when they look over 
the world and see the wreck and 
ruin that has been wrought in the 
very centers of modern Christianity 
they will search for something more 
powerful in effecting the salvation 
and peace of men. When their eyes 
shall light upon this community, es- 
tablished as a city upon a hill, whose 
light will shine forth and direct the 
attention of the world, they shall 
say: "What is this?" "Come, let 
us go up to the mountain of the 
House of the God of Jacob, that we 
may learn of His ways and walk in 
His paths." Such shall be the dec- 
laration of the honest in heart in the 
years that are yet to come, and I 
appeal to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to live from this day forward 
more nearly that standard that has 
been laid down and established, live 
up to what the Gospel teaches. 

The best of us have never ob- 
tained from the Gospel what the 
Gospel would give, and I say that 
there will be an opportunity such 
as has never been given before, to 
demonstrate in a practical way what 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Gospel is. There are numerous 
evidences that ought to inspire and 
influence every boy and girl, and 
every man and woman that here 
is the truth. No matter what dis- 
couragements we meet — and some- 
times we get discouraged, and some- 
times we are offended, and some- 
times we go away like some Saints 
of old did from Jesus. He looked 
upon them tenderly, as they de- 
parted, and said to the Apostles : 
"Will ye go also?" He had taught 
them doctrine that was hard to ob- 
serve ; it required personal sacrifice 
and self-denial. If so tempted, I 
hope we shall say as Peter did : 
"Whither shall we go? Thou hast 
the words of eternal life?" And I 
want to ask every young man and 
young woman, and every member 
of the Church, if the day of trial 
comes, and you may be offended 
grieved and feel that somebody has 
not treated you just right — I want 
you to ask ''Whither shall you go?" 
Ask yourself : "Is there a haven O'f 
rest for you outside of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints?" And should we not be 
willing to be true though trials may 
come. Ella Wheeler Wilcox said : 
"It was easy to be pleasant when the 
world went like a song, but the 
man worth while is the man who 
smiles when everything goes- dead 
wrong." I paraphrase her words. 
Tt is easy enough for you to be a 
member of the Church when all we 
ask and covet and desire comes to 
us, when if we ask for prosperity it 
comes ; when our sick lie at the 
point of death and we pray for them 
and appeal to God, and they are 
healed. We are then quite willing 
to be members of the Church. It is 
easy for us, when our brothers are 
all very agreeable, and there is no 
disturbance, and we have our own 



sweet will and way, it is easy, then, 
for us to be members .of the Church. 
But the man worth while, and the 
man who will survive, is the man 
who will take the disappointments 
of life, the man or woman who will 
stand in the presence of appalling- 
disasters. Death comes, and not 
life, when you seek life ; when you 
desire prosperity, we are tried with 
poverty, with affliction and with 
temptations of the world. It is then 
the test comes, and strength must be 
exhibited, it is then that it takes true 
courage, love and fidelity to believe 
the truth and live it. And so, not- 
withstanding we have difficulties 
and obstacles, here is the truth. We 
must learn early to know that it is 
the truth, that we can trust God. 
come what may, that we may stand 
unappalled, no matter what the lit- 
tle personal difficulties and obstacles 
and fault-finding or complaint we 
may have. We must have such trust 
and abiding faith that if we are not 
made the Bishop of the ward or 
counselor of the bishopric, or Pres- 
ident of the stake, that we will still 
be true, just as true and faithful as 
a lay member of the Church. My 
glory, my heaven, shall come 
through my individual work, and I 
must be willing to trust him, no 
matter whether I have my own 
sweet way or not. 

I have thought the love displayed 
on the part of our Father in heaven 
towards His people, towards the 
world, and especially towards the 
Latter-day Saints, was sufficient to 
hold us, no matter what may come. 
And as I look back upon the ex- 
perience of this Church, its trials 
and difficulties have been many, and 
yet out from these many difficulties 
our Father has brought goodness 
and blessings to the Latter-day 
Saints. I have thought of our own

great Civil War, and of the drivings 
and mobbings and pillaging of the 
Latter-day Saints ; I have no doubt 
with what great sorrow and great 
difficulty our fathers and mothers 
left their homes, forsook those 
goodly lands and made that won- 
derful pilgrimage to this land, be- 
lieving that it was the trial of their 
lives. And it was a severe trial, but 
they had to wait only a short time 
to see, shining behind those dark 
clouds, the smiling face of their 
heavenly Father, for He led them 
to the only place in all this goodly 
land where there was peace; and 
the very place where they wanted to 
stay became the battle field between 
the North and South; and had the 
Church remained it would have suf- 
fered in the midst of the conflict. 
Through the mercy of the Lord we 
were taken away from the war zone 
of the United States, and brought to 
this land of peace. Not that we 
shirked our responsibilties, for the 
first message that went over the 
wires to President Lincoln by Pres- 
ident Young, who was then the gov- 
ernor of this territory was, "Utah 
has not seceded, but is firm for the 
Constitution and the Union," and 
offered the services of our men. The 
services were accepted, hundreds of 
them enlisted, and then, through the 
kind providence of our. Father, we 
were not placed at the battlefront, 
but were given the privilege of do- 
ing military duty in the western part 
of the country ; and the regular sol- 
diers from here were withdrawn to 
do service at the front of the battle. 
I now look back upon the wonderful 
gathering of modern Israel, one of a 
city and two of a family, have been 
gathered to this land. "Come out 
of her, O ye, my people, that ye be 
not partakers of her plagues," has a 
clear meaning to us now. We ought 



to be thankful to be here, brethren 
from Great Britain, from Austria, 
and all those nations that are now 
full of trouble and strife. We 
might have been in the European 
armies, fighting, had it not been for 
the Gospel that reached our fathers 
and mothers, and brought them to 
this land. Once again the wonder- 
ful manifestation of the goodness 
and the mercy of the Lord is indi- 
cated in the peaceful settlement of 
the Latter-day Saints in glorious 
America, the land of peace, the land 
of Zion. 

I proclaim to you that there is if 
we shall observe and study, enough 
evidence to satisfy us all, notwith- 
standing our enemies have been nu- 
merous, our drivings and mobbings 
have been many ; and though today 
we stand misrepresented and mis- 
understood, that the favor of the 
Almighty is over this people. If 
God ever had His hand over a peo- 
ple in the history of this world, then 
that people are the Latter-day 
Saints. 

I have thought, as I have had the 
opportunity of traveling over the 
sections where our people were once 
established, and have seen the blight 
that has fallen upon them .and sel- 
dom have I discovered one of them 
that is as large as it was when the 
Saints left it. Some are without 
railroads and sadly neglected; that 
the man was blind who could not 
see that the disfavor of the Lord 
rested upon those who abused and 
drove the Latter-day Saints from 
their homes in Missouri and Illinois. 
And his favor is with them in the 
mountain fastnesses, the desert 
wastes smile and blossom as a rose ; 
the late and early frosts were 
stayed, the springs were opened, the 
ground became productive ; and the 
blessings of God has been wherever

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Latter-day Saints have estab- 
lished themselves, until it seems to 
me that the man or woman is blind 
indeed who cannot see this evidence 
of God's goodness and mercy to us. 
I have felt that the Lord wanted us 
to understand that He loves us ; He 
was teaching us this when He gave 
to' Abraham the test of his life, to 
offer his son, Isaac, whom he loved 
with all his heart, the child of his 
promise, to give him as a sacrifice, 
he was speaking to us of His love 
through the test of Father Abraham. 
He was trying to make us feel how 
much He loved us, that He would 
give His Only Begotten Son for us. 

There have been numerous evi- 
dences given to the world from the 
very beginning, that our heavenly 
Father loved His children, in the 
blessing of the people of the world 
with health, life and strength, that 
has been given to each one of us ; 
and if there is anything bigger and 
greater than His giving of His pre- 
cious Son, as an evidence of His 
love towards men in the world, then 
I do not know what the Father 
could do to manifest His love. 

Take the case of Abraham: he 
was to be the example and the pat- 
tern or illustration of the love and 
" affection that the Father had for his 
children. "Take your only begotten 
son and offer him as a sacrifice." I 
have thought of the poor old man 
gathering up the fagots, starting up 
the mountain with his child of prom- 
ise. Three days they walked until 
they reached the place where the 
sacrifice was to take place, and then 
his only child and son of promise 
said to his father: "We have for- 
gotten something, father. Where is 
the sacrifice ?" Oh, how it must have 
torn the father, made his heart to 
bleed to hear from the innocent lips 
of his child, whom he loved better 



than life itself, the reminder that he 
should take the life of his child ! He 
could not speak, his heart must have 
swelled almost to bursting. And 
still he went on day after day, until 
he reached the spot. The altar was 
erected, the fagots placed upon it, 
the child bound, the steel bared, the 
arm raised that should strike the 
blow. "It is enough," said the angel 
who stayed the hand. Here is the 
sacrifice. It was to make you feel 
what our Father felt, when He who 
loved His Son better than it is pos- 
sible for mortals to love their own 
flesh and blood, gave His Son to the 
world, for the world's redemption, 
for the world's peace, and the 
world's salvation. Do you not think 
that while the Father, who had the 
power to save His Son from the 
abuse, from the crown of thorns, 
from the whippings and mistreat- 
ment ; do you not think it was a 
trial for Him, who had the power 
to save His Son, to stand by and 
witness the appeal of the Son, in 
agony until great drops of blood 
came from His body. "If it is pos- 
sible, save me, O Father!" Think 
of your own child. If your child 
was in distress, is there a man 
among us entrusted with the power 
to save, and would not use it? God 
knows that we are so human that if 
He should give us power to save our 
own, we would save them every 
time. And yet he had the power to 
save and did not save. What mother 
would not fly through fire and water 
at hearing the appeal of her child in 
distress. How it must have tried 
the father to hear the cry and la- 
mentation of the Son : "If it is pos- 
sible, Father, let it pass by!" I say 
the Father was grief-stricken when 
He heard the taunting of those who 
stood by? "He saved others, why 
don't He save Himself?" After the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



hours of grief and agony, there 
came a moment when Jesus cried 
out, "My God, my God, why hast 
thou forsaken me?" If Jesus truly 
said that, it was not that the Father 
had forsaken, but that the hour had 
arrived, which often arrives in our 
own human experience, an hour 
when the mother, for example, who 
cannot any longer stand to bear the 
sight of her dying child, after the 
farewell is given, is taken out of the 
room, not to witness the last dying 
struggles of her loved one. And so, 
the Father, taxed to the utmost, had 
withdrawn, and somewhere was 
weeping for His beloved Son. Even 
He could not stand the sight any 
longer. But as I have thought of 
it, in my heart I have thanked God, 
that when in that critical moment, 
He might have saved His Son, he 
saw us, perishing in the grave, lost 
to Him, and lost to that salvation 
which is to come, he saw that on 
the one hand, and the appeals and 
the suffering of His Son on the 
other ; and, thank God, He decided 
in our favor, and allowed the suffer- 
ing and death of His Son. And in 
that, 1 maintain that He has mani- 
fested His love for us, that ought 
to make us trust him, though clouds 
may gather and darkness come, 
though like Job of old, "He may 
slay me, yet shall I trust Him," be 
cause I know that He loves me, and 
I know that He is not anxious to 
see my tears of sorrow and- distress. 
I know that He designs to purge me 
and purify me, and that behind this 
apparent darkness and cloud, there 
is a smiling face. 

So I say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, if doubt and discouragement 
shall ever come to your heart with 
reference to the truth of this work 
established, look back upon these 
evidences of the wonderful provi- 



dence and mercy and love of our 
Father, and read anew, the truth 
that God loves us, that this is His 
work, that His Son Jesus lives, 
and is the Savior of the world, and 
that the Elders of this Church are 
the servants of the Father in heaven. 
We are human beings with human 
weaknesses, and yet I confess to 
you that I have had the opportunity 
to meet leading men of other "com- 
munities, and I say in all earnest- 
ness, and I do not- want to be a hero- 
worshiper, either, but I assert to 
you without fear of contradiction, I 
have never met, in all the world, 
men whose hearts are as clean and 
as pure and as undefiled as the lead- 
ers of this Church. I testify to you 
that they are the servants of God, 
that the light is in the ship, and God 
is at the helm. May He give us the 
strength to stay by the ship until she 
weathers the storms and comes into 
that haven of rest after the great 
battle that God has assigned to her 
is ended, and human emancipation, 
redemption and salvation — and, ul- 
timately, the reign of peace is ob- 
tained. That out of this trouble and 
this strife shall merge peace. The 
world may have to get it through 
the gates of war, but there shall 
come an era of peace, when wicked- 
ness shall cease, when the powers 
that have oppressed men shall be 
done away with, and liberties and 
rights shall be given to every nation 
that we enjoy in this favored land. 

There is no blunder. Though 
death and destruction may yet be 
numerous and abundant on all 
hands, I can see, shining through 
the black clouds of the present, an 
era of peace, a day of rest and sal- 
vation. I can see a people leading 
to that way, pointing the way for 
the countless thousands who shall 
remain : the mission to do this is

God bless them that they may fulfill 
their divine mission and destiny, I 
ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER Q. HALE. 

(President of Boise Stake of Zion.) 

When I got on the train yesterday 
evening, leaving Boise. I had the 
pleasure of meeting a gentleman 
from New York,' a distinguished 
man, who stated to me that he had 
spent the last five months in this 
part of the country, investigating the 
history of the people who developed 
this country, and what he found is 
a great revelation to him, in the re- 
suits and labors of the men who 
live here. He stated that he be- 
longed to a distinguished church of 
the world ; and, in the diocese of 
New York, he stated, they have over 
five million dollars in the vaults and 
treasuries of that church. Not- 
withstanding all their enormous 
wealth, said he, there is poverty on 
every hand, there is sin in every 
community. We see the laws of God 
violated every day, and yet we have 
all this means, we have many 
churches sending their spires up to 
heaven. Since I have been among 
you, I have observed the great 
wealth you have, and I have also 
observed the energetic, progressive 
people. You seem to be working 
with one heart and mind for one 
purpose, and the revelation of my 
life is to see what has been accomp- 
lished here. Within the lifetime of 
a man these valleys have been made 
to blossom as a rose, the ground 
has been reclaimed from its aridity, 
the soil has been moistened and 
made fertile, and has given forth of 
its life, and brought forth crops to 
gladden the heart and feed hungry 



souls. Said he: "Tell me if you 
can, what is the vital force behind 
all this? How has it all been 
brought about? How is your peo- 
ple held together? How is it there 
is less iniquity and less sin? How 
is it there is a less percentage of 
immorality among young men and 
young women ? How is it that your 
jails are less populated by your peo- 
ple than by the outsiders?" I told 
him the only solution to that ques- 
tion is in the fact that we have the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that 
Gospel we apply to our lives. 

Every one who has come here to- 
day will contribute his share to the 
general enjoyment ; we will go away 
satisfied. He' who is an hungered, 
when he sits down to the table of 
the Lord, he will go away full. This 
is a Gospel of work, this is a Church 
of workers, and every man in it has 
some position to fill, has some re- 
sponsibility upon his shoulders, and 
knows his place. He does not de- 
pend upon a crutch that indicates 
he has not ability to stand alone. 
In the various organizations of this 
Church, from the heads of the 
Church down to the least member, 
you find opportunity for every man 
to exercise ability, develop his char- 
acter, his virtues and talents, for 
attainment of salvation and the ex- 
altation of his soul, in the name of 
the Master, who is the Savior of 
all mankind. I have made a little 
study of this question, and I am 
of the opinion, firm and convinced, 
that no man can develop any vir- 
tue unless he has exercised ' that 
virtue. If you have love in your 
heart, and desire to attract love to 
you, you must exercise love toward 
your fellowmen. You must give 
expression to good things, in .order 
that good things may come back to 
you. 



ELDER HEBER Q. HALE.

The lives of the Latter-day Saints 
are attracting the attention of the 
entire world, from the simple fact 
that they live their religion, that 
they give expression to the virtues 
inculcated by the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Every man who cultivates 
a field knows that it is through the 
exercise of his mind, and the mus- 
cles and power of his body, that he 
is able to wring from the soil the 
harvest. He knows that it is only 
as he contributes his labors that he 
shall be rewarded. He knows that 
he must contribute time and ability, 
he must sow the seed in the ground 
in order to reap a harvest that will 
gladden his heart and fill his gran- 
ary, and provide the means to tide 
him over the time when the ground 
ceases to yield, and the chills of 
winter surround him. So it is that 
every man, if he be a merchant, a 
school teacher, a lawyer, a doctor 
or skilled in any profession, he 
knows that in order to receive a 
reward for his labors, he must ex- 
ercise his talents. The student in 
the college knows, and utilizes it, he 
will be duly rewarded for his ef- 
forts. So it is in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ ; as we give of our 
i time, as we give of our talents, as 
we exercise our virtues, among our 
fellow men for their good, all these 
unselfish activities will bring us a 
satisfactory reward. 

That is why the Latter-day Saints 
are becoming famous ; they are 
looked up to by the world today be- 
cause they live the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. They have in their hearts 
love for their fellow men. They 
give of their time, they give of their 
talents, they give of their love to 
others, and all those things come 
back unto them to gladden their 
hearts and make them happy. As 
already stated, this is a Church of 



workers. We believe in the prin- 
ciple of "Six days shalt thou labor, 
and the seventh shall be unto thee 
a day of rest." We believe that the 
day of rest is not earned until it 
is preceded by six days of labor. 
We believe in the principle that in- 
iquity spells decay. It is only the 
man that is actively alive that can 
survive ; it is only the man that will 
properly exercise himself who will 
ever succeed. A German scientist 
discovered this principle in his ex- 
periments, that the longer an electric 
current passes through a volume of 
oxide magnesium, the greater be- 
comes the conductivity of that 
thing. The same law holds good 
in the mind of man ; the longer a 
certain train of thought is concen- 
trated in the brain, the greater be- 
comes the brain to the conductivity 
of that thought. The more we ex- 
ercise our muscles, the greater is 
the power they develop. The more 
we exercise our virtues, the easier 
it becomes for us to exercise them, 
the greater they increase and be- 
come of value to ourselves and 
others. So it has proven in the ex- 
ercise of the qualities among the 
Latter-day Saints. We have de- 
veloped young man and young wo- 
men of virtuous character, the su- 
periors of whom are not to be found 
anywhere else in the world today, 
and it is because of these- things 
which I have mentioned. Mark 
Twain said: "Man is the only an- 
imal that blushes." He could have 
gone on to say : Man is the onlv 
animal that has need to blush, be- 
cause he is the only animal that 
ever drinks intoxicants ; he is the 
only animal that smokes tobacco ; 
he is the only animal that beats his 
wife, he is the only animal that tells 
a lie; he is the only animal that is

immoral in his nature ; and he has 
need to blush indeed. 

Some of the purposes of the mis- 
sion of the Latter-day Saints in the 
world are to reduce crime, to in- 
struct men and women in the Gos- 
pel of Christ, that they may resist 
evil. The way to do this is to build 
the foundation of true manhood, 
make the man complete, and 'so 
morally courageous that he will al- 
ways say, "No !" when tempted to 
do wrong". When he says "yes," it 
will be a response to do right. He 
is in control of the tabernacle of 
God which his spirit inhabits, and 
has been given it to manifest his 
agency. A man can only claim that 
he is a man when he is master of 
himself ; when he regulates what 
goes into that body : when he can 
hold his tongue, and say only things 
that should be said ; when he can ex- 
ercise feeling and kindness in return 
for scorn ; who can say a word of 
lnve in return for bitterness; when 
he can do good 'for evil ; when' he 
can respond to the wants and neces- 
sities of his fellow men. 

These are the kind of young men 
and young women this Church is 
producing, and I am thankful and 
proud that I have the honor o£ be- 
longing to it, and of contributing my 
mite to the building of this broad, 
expansive, ennobling Church, known 
as the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-da} r Saints. To me it is the 
grandest thing in all the world ; 
there is nothing' like unto it. I find 
facilities for expressing all the good 
there is in me ; I find opportunity for 
developing all the goodness that T 
should develop. I find opportuni- 
ties for my social need, for literarv 
need, 'for spiritual need. When I 
come to a meeting of this kind, I 
come hungry so that I can sit at the 
table of God and be filled. I want 



to have Church work to do, so that 
1 can create 'an appetite for spirit- 
ual thing's, just as the laborer works 
in the field and has created an ap- 
petite for his daily bread ; he eats 
with a relish, because he has worked 
and has done well. 

May God bless us and help us, 
and inspire us to do good, and in- 
spire us to manifest by exercise the 
good there is in us, to upbuilding 
and betterment of ourselves, and to 
the glory of God who is our Cre- 
ator ; T ask, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER GERMAN E.ELLSWORTH 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am 
thankful for the privilege of associ- 
ating with you this afternoon upon 
this Temple block. T am thankful 
for the association of men and wo- 
men whose hearts are drawn to- 
wards God and to the restored truth, 
that will save and redeem His chil- 
dren. T am thankful for my parent- 
age, and for the privilege of com- 
ing to earth in this day and time, 
the best time that has ever been in 
the history of the world, when so 
many wonderful things have been 
revealed for the blessing and com- 
fort of mankind. T am thankful for 
citizenship in this glorious country, 
that has been made up from the best 
hood of all nations. I am thankful 
that my parents were among those 
who came in response to the voice 
of the good shepherd, "one of a city 
and two of a family," to this goodly 
land, a land of peace, the land of 
Joseph. 

You who have had your patri- 
archal blessings have been told that 
you are of the lineage of Joseph, 
through Ephraim or Manassah, and 



ELDER GERMAN E.ELLSWORTH. 73 



that you have been gathered to this 
goodly land, under the guiding in- 
fluence of the divine will, to escape 
the judgments of God which are to 
overtake' the wicked in the last days. 
You have also been told that, be- 
cause of your former faithfulness, 
present willingness to obey the voice 
of truth, that light and faith has 
been given you which would lead 
you to keep the commandments of 
the Lord and be prepared not only to 
withstand those things which God 
has said would be visited upon those 
who did not believe in Him, but pre- 
pare yon to return to your heavenly 
home and there dwell with the right- 
eous. 

I rejoice with the righteous that 
early in my life, a testimony of the 
Lord Jesus came to me, and with 
that testimony knowledge, that I 
was a son of God, destined to go 
back and dwell with Him if 1 lived 
right in this life. My heart swells 
within me, to see the hundreds of 
young men with whom I have la- 
bored come to this knowledge, and 
to see them realize who they are and 
what their mission is in the earth. 
1 can tell you that it is a glorious 
thing for a young man to under- 
stand early in life, that he has been 
placed upon the earth to perform a 
great mission, and to realize what 
his blessings will be for keeping the 
commandments of the Lord. Salva- 
tion is the blessing promised as a re- 
ward for a well spent life, but I hold 
that if there was an eternal reward 
the blessings that come to the man 
here in this life for being honest, 
truthful, and virtuous is more than 
worth the effort. Every one of you 
will agree with me that honesty 
livings its own reward, that truthful- 
ness brings its reward, that a virtu- 
i .us and honorable life among your 
fellowmen will bring peace of mind. 



that makes of earth a heaven. But 
in addition to the earthly rewards, 
we are firm in the knowledge that 
heavenly and eternal blessings are 
added for keeping the command- 
ments of God and living righteously 
on this earth. We are promised. that 
we shall go back and- dwell with all 
other men and women who have 
lived honest and upright lives. "Eye 
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither 
have entered into the heart of man 
the things which God hath prepared 
for them that love Him ; but God 
hath revealed them unto us by His 
Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all 
things, vea, the deep things of 
God." 

From the history of the world we 
learn what a glorious thing it is to 
understand who you are. and why 
you are here upon the earth. The 
Lord, from the beginning of this 
world's history, has opened the eyes 
of young men. in various ages, and 
revealed to them their mission, and 
they have become great leaders 
among the children of our Father. 

You remember the Prophets 
David, Samuel, Daniel, Joseph 
Smith, and many others who have 
been selected by our Father as lead- 
ers. They were selected and noti- 
fied early' in their youth, or young 
manhood. Even the Savior of men, 
at twelve years of age, understood 
that He must be "about His Fath- 
er's business." and that understand- 
ing at that early time in His life 
helped Him for the great mission 
that rested upon His shoulders. So 
close was He to the Father that, 
after the temptation, angels were 
sent who ministered to Him and 
strengthened Him. Latter-day 
Saints have learned, early in their 
lives, who they are, and why they 
are in the earth, and everyone of 
you understand well the question 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Lord put to Job, when He said : 
"Where wast thou when I laid the 
foundations of the earth?" Like- 
wise the statement to Jeremiah 
wherein the Lord sanctified and or- 
dained him a prophet before he was 
born. 

Through the Spirit of the Lord 
our eyes have been opened as to who 
we are, and as to our missions in the 
earth, and, knowing that, we ought 
to be the best people in the world. 
We ought to be a light to all people, 
and so filled with love that we would 
be like a healing balm to the na- 
tions. Our love and devotion to the 
work of the Lord, and our willing- 
ness to go to the ends of the earth, 
have proven we do love the Lord, 
and love our fellowmen ; through us 
all nations of the earth have been 
enabled to hear His voice, and many 
have gathered to Zion for safety. 

I rejoice in the testimony of 
Brother Ballard concerning the 
Latter-day Saints, that in all their 
mobbings and whippings and driv- 
ings, that they did not retaliate in 
kind but trusted in the Lord to fight 
their battles for them. My mind 
goes back to the time when the 
army was coming to Utah, coming 
with the same spirit that inspired 
the organized mobs of Missouri and 
Illinois. We did not meet them in 
Echo canyon with intention of shed- 
ding their blood, but to detain them 
till proper representation could be 
sent to the government. The fun- 
damental thing pertaining to our 
mission in Echo canyon was to shed 
no blood, to do everything we could 
to keep the United States soldiers in 
the mountains all winter. We did 
not want the blood of our fellowmen 
upon us. I believe we have proven, 
at least in a small degree, that we 
can turn the other cheek when smit- 
ten, on the one, and we hope to be 



strong enough, as a people and na- 
tion, at this hour to extend the olive 
branch of peace. 

My mind also goes back to Joseph 
who was taken by his brethren and 
put into the pit, but afterward 
drawn out and sold into Egypt. How- 
he withstood temptations and bore 
in patience his imprisonment 
brought upon him for turning aside 
the wiles of a wicked woman. 
Joseph, the son of Jacob, was one 
man that proved himself worthy of 
his birth and parentage, and worthy 
to be the savior of his father's 
house, both temporal and spiritual. 
Notwithstanding their mistreatment 
of him, and their great injustice, 
when they came to Joseph he opened 
his arms and received his brethren 
with a love beyond the power of 
words to describe, and in the good- 
ness of his heart forgave them, 
showing especial interest in Simeon 
who was the arch enemy against 
him in selling him into Egypt. My 
blood tingled with the spirit mani- 
fested in the thought of Joseph 
meeting his brethren, and his desire 
to gather to his bosom his brother 
Benjamin, whose mother had died 
since Joseph had been in Egypt. 1 
recall the wonderful picture of 
Joseph forgiving his brethren, and 
how they came and bowed down 
before him, in fulfillment of his boy- 
hood dream. 

We are the sons of Joseph, 
through Ephraim or Manasseh. We 
are living in the land of Joseph, a 
land of peace and promise to all who 
will keep the commandments of the 
Lord, and not oppress their broth- 
ers. It seems that the eyes of the 
nations of the world are turned to- 
ward this land, and commissioners 
from all the war-stricken countries 
are being sent to represent favorably 
their nation before this government. 



ELDER GERMAN E.ELLSWORTH. 



as if the Lord had set us to be 
peacemakers among the nations. 
Even more shall it be in spiritual 
things. The honest in heart of the 
world shall come bending to the 
land of Joseph, that they may learn 
the ways of the Lord, and walk in 
His paths, for "out of Zion shall go 
forth the Law, and the word of the 
Lord from Jerusalem." 

I pray that God will help us to 
prove ourselves worthy, that we 
might be ready to open our arms to 
the world and save them as Joseph 
saved his brethren. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints. I 
love them. I love their missionary 
sons, and I am happy in laboring 
with them, in seeing their growth 
and development, seeing their eyes 
opened, their hearts touched, and 



their tongues loosened to bear wit- 
ness to the world concerning God 
and Christ, and their mission upon 
the earth. May God grant us peace, 
and all other blessings, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Lo ! the mighty God appearing, 
From on high Jehovah speaks ! 

Eastern lands the summons hearing. 
O'er the west His thunder breaks. 

Elder W. E. Evans pronounced 
the benediction. 

At the afternoon services in the 
Tabernacle the audience numbered 
over ten thousand, in the Assembly 
Hall about twenty-five hundred, and 
fully two thousand at the open air 
meeting. 



SECOND DAY. 



Tn the Tabernacle, Monday Oc- 
tober 5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Elder Erastns S. Christensen of- 
fered the invocation. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Gifts of the Gospel possessed by Latter- 
day Saints — Blessings secured by du- 
ties fulfilled — Works an expression of 
Faith — Knowledge concerning God 
must be followed by obedience to Him. 

It is a pleasure to me, as it always 
is. to meet with the Latter-day 
Saints in our conferences and to lis- 
ten to the inspired' words that we 
alwavs hear upon these occasions. 
T have never in my life from the 
days of early childhood until now 
attended a conference, — and T have 
no recollection of ever, missing one 
when I have been in the city, unless 
confined to my bed with sickness, — ■ 
but that I have been fed the bread 
of life. And I experienced that same 
pleasure in our meetings yesterday. 

T endorse with all my heart all of 
the very splendid things that we 
have heard here in our conference 



meetings, and at our Sunday School 
Union meeting last evening. I de- 
sire most earnestly that the few mo- 
ments which I may occupy that the 
same good Spirit which has been 
enjoyed by those who have pre- 
ceded me may fall to my portion. 
The only desire of my heart is to 
say something that may be encour- 
aging and uplifting to the Latter- 
day Saints. I realize the beauties 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I re- 
joice exceedingly in a knowledge 
of the divinity of the work in whicli 
we are engaged. I rejoice in know- 
ing that all the gifts and graces and 
every power, privilege and blessing 
which has ever been enjoyed by the 
Saints of God in any dispensation of 
the Gospel upon the earth are en- 
joyed today by the Latter-day 
Saints. I rejoice in knowing that 
the things which should be enjoyed, 
the blessings, the healing power of 
Almighty God, the inspiration of 
His Spirit whereby men and women 
have manifestations from Him, the 
inspiration of the Spirit of God, 
whereby people speak with new ton- 
gues, and have the interpretation 
thereof, and each and every grace 
and gift, are enjoyed today by the 
Latter-day Saints. My heart swells 
with gratitude when I listen to an 
inspirational sermon about the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ and of our rela- 
tionship to our Heavenly Father, 
as we heard here yesterday from 
President Charles W. Penrose. I 
rejoice in the vigor of his body and 
his mind ; although he is past eighty- 
two years of age, I have never heard 
him speak with greater power or in- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



77 



spiration, and as I listened I knew 
that all the Latter-day Saints in the 
audience as well, rejoiced. 

I asked myself while enjoying the 
inspiration of the Spirit of God to 
him, and endorsing all he said of the 
blessings that are to come to us and 
our- relationship to our Father and 
our Savior, whether the Latter-day 
Saints were living in such a way 
and in such a manner that they 
would be entitled to the blessings of 
God which belong to the Gospel of 
[esus Christ, when the battle' of life 
is ended. I asked myself, how many 
who are rejoicing here today under 
the inspiration of the Spirit of the 
Lord are in very deed Latter-day 
Saints ? -how many are full and hon- 
est tithe payers? how many are ob- 
serving in very deed the Word of 
Wisdom? how many are attending 
to their secret and their family 
prayers? I thought of this when 
President Lyman was talking upon 
prayer. We have in very deed the 
truth, but unless we, as Latter-day 
Saints, live the truth, all these glori- 
ous principles are of no value to us. 

This morning, in our Mutual 
meeting, one of the General Board 
referred to some splendid plans that 
had been drawn by an architect, 
costing thousands of dollars, but 
finally it was decided by the man 
ordering the plans not to make use 
of them. We have the plan of life 
and salvation ; we have in very deed 
the truth, but are we making use of 
the plan ? Are we Latter-day 
Saints? If not, then we are not 
entitled to the blessings of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. 

"By their fruits, ye shall know 
them." The Lord has said, as re- 
corded in the Doctrine and Cove : 
nants, that when we do that which 
is commanded that then He is 
bound, but if we do not keep the 



commandments of the Lord, we 
have no promise ; and so far as I 
have the ability, I would like to im- 
press upon the hearts of the Latter- 
day Saints to be doers of the word 
and not hearers of it only. If there 
is anyone of the former apostles 
above another whose teachings have 
found a hearty response in my 
heart, it is the Apostle James and 
his teachings wherein he emphasizes 
that faith without works is dead, 
that it is like the body without the 
spirit, and we all know that when 
the spirit leaves the body the body 
must be buried, or soon becomes 
obnoxious. We do not want a dead 
faith, -we want a living faith, we 
want a faith that will give us the- 
power and the ability to live the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ in very deed. 
When we go to meeting, we should 
go with a prayer in our hearts that 
the Lord will inspire those who 
speak, by His spirit, and after they 
have spoken to us by the inspiration 
of His Spirit, we should go away 
with a determination, with a desire, 
with a prayer, that we shall in very 
deed learn the lesson that we have 
heard, that we shall put it into prac- 
tice in our lives. 

I remarked last Sunday, at a con- 
ference, that when young it always 
appeared ridiculous to me to call the 
last day of school, the day when 
young men and young ladies receive 
their diplomas, when they graduate, 
after completing their lessons, to 
call it commencement day ; but as 1 
have grown in years and experience. 
T have discovered that in very deed 
commencement day with the boy 
and the girl who have graduated 
from school is the day when they 
commence the battle of life. This 
life is a school, and commencement 
day to us will be when the battle of 
this life is o'er, and we commence

anew to travel on forever. Then if 
we can pass an examination, we are 
welcomed back into the presence of 
our Heavenly Father, because we 
have been true and faithful. 

I never read this testimony of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigdon with reference to the Sav- 
ior : ^ /'Now, after the many testi- 
monies which have been given of 
Him, this is the testimony last of 
all, which we give of Him, that He 
lives; for we saw Him, even on the 
right hand of God, and we heard 
the voice bearing record that He is 
the Only Begotten of the Father, 
that by Him and through Him, and 
of Him the worlds were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are. be- 
gotten sons and daughters unto 
God," but I rejoice in this testi- 
mony, in this knowledge, which 
these men had of actually seeing 
God, with the Savior sitting at His 
right hand, and actually hearing the 
voice bear witness that He is in very 
deed the Savior of the world. I re- 
joice every time I read their testi- 
mony. I rejoice also when I read 
of the blessings x>i the Gospel as re- 
ferred to here yesterday by Brother 
Penrose when speaking of those 
who had accepted the Gospel, who 
had gone down into the waters of 
baptism and who would be worthy 
by living according to the teachings 
of the Gospel, to enter into the celes- 
tial kingdom. I rejoice in this 
knowledge, but how I do mourn 
when I find that there are scores 
who know all these things, who tes- 
tify that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the true and living God, 
and yet their lives do not square 
with this knowledge. Knowledge is 
absolutely of no value, except to 
condemn us before God, unless we 
live up to that knowledge. 



That God may help each and 
every one of us as we grow in years, 
as we increase in understanding, as 
we advance in the light of the Gos- 
pel of Testis Christ, to grow in hu- 
mility, in good deeds, in the love of 
our fellows, and in a determination 
to serve Him with all our hearts, is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON, 

Attainment of excellence possible only 
as result of earnest effort— God's great 
blessings worthy our willing self-sac- 
rifice. 

This is a very remarkble confer- 
ence. The hosts of Israel have come 
up to wait upon the Lord. By actual 
count, the congregation assembled 
in this building yesterday afternoon 
numbered ten thousand and fifty- 
five souls, and at the same time 
there was a gathering in the assem- 
bly hall and an open-air meeting- 
upon the grounds. The counsel, the 
testimony, the instructions delivered 
to us have been varied and choice, 
and I am sure will be sanctified to 
the good of the Latter-day Saints. 

I take it, brethren and sisters, that 
anything in life worth having and 
keeping can only be obtained by 
effort, and the greater the value of 
the object desired, the greater the 
effort required in its attainment. 
For example, here is a young man 
who desires an education, full and 
complete. His father cannot give it 
to him, his mother cannot give it to 
him, the instructors in the school 
cannot give it to him; but the way 
is open, it depends on his own in- 
dividual efforts. Now, the question 
is, will he pay the price? It means 
days and weeks and months of con- 
centration, of devotion and attention 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



r 9 



to his studies, but if he will give the 
proper efforts to his ambition he 
will succeed. And again, our friend 
there is seeking a profession, per- 
haps it is that of the law or medi- 
cine, or dentistry in which he de- 
sires to excel. Will he pay the price? 
ft means the avoidance of riotous 
living, it means the renunciation of 
light and unnecessary amusements, 
it means very close, careful and 
strict- attention to his business. It 
may be necessary for him occasion- 
ally to burn the midnight oil, but as 
in the other instance, the way, the 
opportunity, is open to him. Will 
he pay the price ? Will he reach up 
to that point where he may receive 
recognition, where he may obtain a 
diploma that will be the foundation 
upon which he can build for the 
future ? 

Here is a young man who is am- 
bitious to be an efficient, thorough 
and successful missionary. Will he 
pay the price ? He cannot become 
so by wishing. The desire, itself, 
will not make him such. It means 
sacrifice, it means that he must lay 
clown his secular affairs, it means 
that he must part with his parents 
and with his sweetheart, if he has 
one, (and he ought to have one), it 
means that he must leave all that is 
near and dear to him and go forth 
into the world. It means- that he 
must be prepared to suffer every 
conceivable inconvenience, that he 
must meet the scorn and ridicule of 
the world, that if need be, he must 
endure persecution. He will be re- 
minded of what the Savior said, 
"Blesed are ye when all men shall 
hate you and persecute you and sep- 
arate you from their company, and 
cast out your name as evil, for the 
Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in 
that day and leap for joy: for great 
shall be vour reward in heaven." 



He must be prepared for these 
things. I remember one instance. I 
cite it as an example. A young mis- 
sionary went forth in the spirit of 
faith and humility, with a determin- 
ation to succeed in his work. He 
was not a preacher in the common 
acceptance of the term. If he stood 
before a congregation he halted and 
stumbled in his speech. He had 
difficulty in finding words to ' ex- 
press himself, but he was a deter- 
mined and incessant worker. He 
was going from morning until night, 
in distributing tracts, in making- 
friends, in visiting and re-visiting 
investigators, in going from family 
to family, until his companion could 
hardly keep up with him. But this 
young missionary was unwearying 
in his labors. He succeeded, he was 
a success in this important activity, 
and before he withdrew from the 
mission field, he was able, under the 
providences of the Lord, to bring- 
some thirty or forty people into the 
Church. He was willing to pay the 
price. 

We have here, upon this block, 
the temple of God, a most wonder- 
ful edifice. Now, within this build- 
ing priceless blessings are dispensed. 
They are within the reach of the 
poorest of the poor and they may 
be denied to the richest of the rich. 
When a man or a woman desires the 
blessings of the House of God, the 
question arises, is he or is she will- 
ing to pay the price, and, mark yon, 
it is not a monetary consideration. 
Strangers have offered considerable 
sums of money from time to time 
to get admission into the temple. 
They wanted to see the interior, they 
wanted to examine it closely, but 
the door was closed against them. 
A thousand, five thousand, ten 
thousand dollars would not bring 
this privilege to them, but yet the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



temple is of easy access to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, if they will but pay 
the price. What is the price? It is 
a consistent, faithful life, as a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ, 
one who observes the command- 
ments of God, one who is humble, 
faithful and diligent. He can pass 
through and obtain for himself and 
perhaps for others, those who are 
dead and passed away, the blessings 
of the Holy Temple, and he can se- 
cure to himself the benefits of the 
new and everlasting covenant. 

Last of all, I take it, that we are 
all ambitious to secure a celestial 
glory in the presence of the Father. 
There is no Latter-day Saint in the 
congregation today, who would be 
satisfied with less. He wants the 
very highest and best that the Lord 
has to give. Will he pay the price? 
And what is the price ? It means, if 
need be, the sacrifice of all earthly 
things, even to our lives, should that 
be required, whether in the mission 
field, or at home, or under any other 
circumstances. If our lives are de- 
manded for the testimony of Jesus, 
then we must be ready and prepared 
to give them. The price of this in- 
estimable blessing is also beautifully 
defined in the seventy-sixth section 
of the book of Covenants : 

"And again, we . bear record, for we 
saw and heard, and this is the testi- 
mony of the Gospel of Christ, concern- 
ing them who come forth in the resur- 
rection of the just; 

"They are they who received the tes- 
timony of Jesus, and believed on His 
name and were baptized after the 
manner of His burial, being buried in 
the water in His name, and this ac- 
cording to the commandment which he 
has given, 

"That by keeping the command- 
ments they might be washed and 
cleansed from all their sins, and re- 
ceive the Holy Spirit by the laying on 
of the hands of him who is ordained 
and sealed unto this power, 



"And who overcome by faith, and 
are sealed by the Holy Spirit of prom- 
ise, which the Father sheds forth upon 
all those who are just and true. 

"They are they who are the church 
of the first born. 

"They are they into whose hands the 
Father has given all things — - 

"They are they who are Priests and 
Kings, who have received of his ful- 
ness, and of his glory, 

"And are Priests of the Most High, 
after the order of Melchizedek, which 
was after the order of Enoch, which 
was after the order of the Only Be- 
gotten Son." 

Now, we see from this that it is 
only possible to attain to so great a 
degree of glory in the presence of 
God by keeping His commandments, 
yielding obedience to the ordinances 
of the Gospel and walking in the 
light continually and being just and y 
true. This is the price we have to 
pay for it, but if we are willing to 
make the sacrifice, if it can be called 
a sacrifice, our highest ambition, our 
fondest hopes,'our most earnest de- 
sires will be realized to the very 
fullest extent. We learn from this, 
that is to say, we learn from the 
manner in which the Lord deals 
with His children, that we cannot 
obtain something for nothing. If we 
secure the blessings then we must 
give the service ; these matters will 
be determined upon merit. We arc 
told in the Scriptures that when the 
dead come forth, they will be judged 
acording to the deeds done in the 
body ; and again, as bearing upon 
this subject, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith laid down this great princi- 
ple ; he said : "There is a law irre- 
vocably decreed in the heavens upon 
which all blessings are predicated, 
and when we receive a blessing from 
God it is by obedience to the law 
upon, which it is predicated." 

May the Lord bless us and help 
us to appreciate His goodness, and

may He put upon us the spirit not 
only to worship Him in prayer and 
song and praise, but also, to labor 
with our might while the day lasts 
for the salvation of souls. I ask it 
in the name of the Lord, Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

was sung by Elder Franklin Mad-

Peace and happiness result of keeping 
God's laws — Church leaders made sor- 
rowful when members sin. 

In referring to my own feelings 
this morning, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I can say that I have been very 
happy in my associations with you 
and others in attending the various 
sessions of this conference, and in 
worshiping the Lord in this capac- 
ity. Without boasting, I confess my 
love for the Lord, for His work and 
for His peopl'e, and I hope my love 
extends to all men, for this is some- 
thing I desire to cultivate. I desire 
and constantly pray for an increase 
of knowledge of the Lord and of the 
Gospel, for an increased apprecia- 
tion and love for the same. I know 
that one having a knowledge of the 
truth of this work experiences great 
happiness and satisfaction, when 
faithful in keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord, and in the dis- 
charge of religious duties, and that 
he experiences pain and self re- 
proach when violating the com- 
mandments of the Lord and in com- 
mitting sin. My conscience con- 
demns me when I do that which is 
wrong, and thus rob myself of that 
peace, happiness and hope I might 
have by answering strictly the re- 
quirements of conscience. 



I have had much satisfaction in 
seeing the faithfulness of men and 
women of the Church who have 
been called to labor as presiding 
officers in various positions, general 
and local. Their devotion has been 
a splendid example and inspiration 
to me ; and because I have the work 
of the Lord at heart and desire its 
triumph, I am not jealous of those 
who have greater ability, and who 
are able to accomplish more than I 
for the cause, but rather take pride 
in their accomplishments and feel a 
common interest with them in the 
success of the work. 

It is a cause for pride that we 
have in the Church men and women 
who would stand in the front ranks 
of intelligent men and women of the 
world. Who are willing to give, 
and are giving to this work the best 
efforts of their lives. I rejoice that 
the Lord rewards all such with the 
bestowal of the Holy Spirit and a 
testimony of the Truth. The com- 
fort that comes to all men and 
women who are devoting them- 
selves in righteousness to the ser- 
vices of the Lord, and for the good 
of their fellowmen is inestimable. 
They receive that peace, joy and 
hope that cannot be purchased with 
the wealth of the world. 

I have had occasion at times to 
sorrow for the sins of others, but 
I thank the Lord I have been able 
to forget, for I do not think I could 
be happy if I had to retain always 
the feelings I sometimes have when 
I go among the people, and it is re- 
vealed to me by presiding authori- 
ties that certain evils exist among 
our people. Revelations are some- 
times made that fill my heart with 
sorrow because of the wrongdoings 
of some members of the Church, 
and also because the Church is af- 
fected thereby. When we disgrace 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ourselves we, to an extent, disgrace 
the Church, and both must suffer. I 
know that men and women who 
have committed sin reap the fruits 
of their sowing. I am just as sure 
that the penalty will be paid in sor- 
row for all wrong doing, as I am 
sure that good deeds will be justly 
rewarded. I am sure the sins of 
this people are a great sorrow to the 
President of this Church, because 
of his responsibility as President 
and his love for the people. We 
could not do better by way of sus- 
taining him and lightening his- load 
of anxiety than by being faithful, 
consistent Latter-day Saints. Those 
who love the people, sorrow for 
their sins and rejoice in their right- 
eousness. 

We read in the Book of Mormon 
(Mosiah 3:7), a prediction of the 
coming of the Lord in the meridian 
of time, and how he would suffer 
for the sins of the people: "For 
behold blood cometh from every 
pore so great shall be his anguish 
for the wickedness and abomina- 
tions of his people." It was in the 
Garden of Gethsemane that this 
nronhecy was fulfilled. Our Father 
in heaven and His Son, the Savior, 
sorrow for the sins we commit and 
rejoice in our righteousness. To 
obey the Lord is a pleasing way of 
serving Him. 

I want to ask the Latter-day 
Saints to support and sustain the 
President of this Church and his 
counselors, and the General Author- 
ities, also those who preside over 
stakes and wards of Zion by avoid- 
ing sin, and being faithful in keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord, 
also by laboring faithfully and dili- 
gently when called upon for the 
good of the Church, and by so doing 
find peace and salvation, and glorify 
our Father in heaven. 



May the Lord add his blessings, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

Our dependence upon God — How we 
know the Truth — The Holy Spirit — 
What is revealed is not incomprehen- 
sible. 

If I sense one thing more fully 
than another, among the many good 
things uttered during this confer- 
ence, it is that reminder from our 
President that we are entirely de- 
pendent upon God — a truth empha- 
sized by Brother Lyman in his re- 
marks, following those of President 
Smith. Brethren and sisters, I feel 
my dependence upon God, that I 
may know what to say to His people 
that shall be for their good, and I 
therefore ask for your prayers, and 
for the inspiration of that Spirit 
which knoweth all things, yea, the 
deep things of God, that searches 
all hearts and reads them as an open 
book, that comprehends our needs 
on such occasions as this, and is 
alone able to supply them. 

How do I know that this is the 
Lord's work? I know it because 
He has shown it to me. How can 
I retain this knowledge without 
Him ? How can I accomplish suc- 
cessfully my mortal pilgrimage and 
lay hold upon eternal life, except 
the Lord be with me? How can 
you or I do anything without Him ? 
There is a spirit, an intelligence, 
that proceeds from His presence and 
fills the immensity of space ; it is 
the light of the sun and the moon 
and the stars ; the light that illum- 
ines our understandings ; the light 
that enlighteneth every man that 
cometh into the world ; but it ex- 
ists in degrees of force and power 
and quantity, and they who live

nearest to God have most of it. They 
are entitled to most, having made 
covenant with Him at the waters of 
baptism, having manifested their 
faith by their works, having re- 
pented of their sins, which have 
been washed away in the manner 
that God has appointed. These are 
entitled to the special gift of God's 
Spirit, and by that Spirit they know 
that this is God's work, and they 
can know it in no other way. The 
most intelligent man in the world, 
whatever his gifts and powers, is 
like a child in the presence of this 
great problem, before which, as was 
predicted ages ago, the wisdom of 
the wise perishes and the under- 
standings of the prudent is hid. 

A friend of mine outside the 
Church said to me in New York 
City a few weeks ago: "I believe 
'Mormonism' to be true, I regard it 
as a sound philosophy, but I do not 
know that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet. If not a prophet," my 
friend added, "he was certainly the 
most marvelous thinker of modern 
times, but I have no testimony that 
he was specially sent from God." 
I asked him how he could expect 
to have such a testimony unless he 
obeyed the Gospel, unless he took 
the course which the Lord has point- 
ed out whereby men may lay hold 
upon divine knowledge. He is an 
honest man, a man of intelligence 
and culture, with no less than eight 
languages at his tongue's end, and 
is apparently versed in all the learn- 
ing of our time; but he does not 
know what you and I know — we 
who have so little of his learning, 
and yet possess something inesti- 
mably greater, a testimony of the 
truth. If he ever arrives at the 
knowledge which you and I possess 
it will be when he has obeyed the 



same principles that you and I have 
obeyed. We believe in God, and in 
the true God at that, not in a phan- 
tom, a man-made deity. We have 
faith in the true God, and have re- 
pented of our sins by turning away 
from them. We have been baptized 
by Divine authority, and have had 
our sins washed away, thus becom- 
ing fit receptacles for the Holy 
Ghost, and the Lord has confirmed 
our faith by the knowledge that 
comes through the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. And this way is open to all ; 
the king upon his throne or the 
peasant in his cot may have it if he 
so desires ; but there is only one way 
for the king or for the peasant. 
When it comes to candidacy for sal- 
vation, for citizenship in the king- 
dom of heaven, all men are equal — 
they get salvation and glory upon 
precisely the same terms. 

During the past summer it was 
my happy privilege to visit some of 
the early scenes of our Church his- 
tory. Among these was the site 
of the old log and frame farm- 
house in the township of Man- 
chester, New York, where the 
Prophet Joseph was living with his 
parents, as a boy between fourteen 
and fifteen years of age, when God 
appeared to him in person, and 
opened the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times. I stood within the 
very grove where it is believed the 
Father and the Son appeared to and 
conversed with him as one man 
converses with another. I am sure I 
cannot tell you how profoundly im- 
pressed I was while standing upon 
the spot where these marvelous 
events took place. I sensed the dif- 
ference between reading of things 
or hearing of them, and 'being where 
T could feel them as I never felt 
them before. Not that any partic- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ular place gives a testimony of the 
truth, but it seemed to me that my 
testimony was renewed, or deepened 
and expanded, by what I saw, and 
I felt the truth more vividly. I 
know, for God has revealed it to 
me, that Joseph Smith was and is a 
prophet of the Most High. I know 
that he saw God face to face and 
spake with Him, and that he saw 
Him in the form of man. I am not 
dependent upon man, but upon God, 
for this knowledge, and as to 
whether I retain it or lose it ; for 
the testimony of the Holy Spirit, by 
which alone we can know and com- 
prehend God, will stay with us or 
depart from us, according to the 
life we lead. 

As I stood there, drinking in the 
inspiration of those sacred scenes, I 
recalled another trip that I had 
taken earlier in the season, in com- 
pany with President Anthon H. 
Lund. Down in Sanpete Valley I 
had come across a little booklet 
which was being distributed by cer- 
tain pious, well-meaning people who 
had come to Utah to convert the 
Latter-day Saints from the supposed 
error of their ways. This little book 
was entitled, "The Truth about 
God." I took the pains to read it 
from lid to lid — not because my 
faith needed confirmation, partic- 
ularly, from such a source, but be- 
cause I wanted to see how far the 
leaven had worked, the leaven of the 
truth about God, received by the 
Prophet Joseph and preached by 
him and other elders of the Church. 
And what did I find in that book? 
Briefly this : That God is a spirit, 
everywhere present ; that He is ut- 
terly incomprehensible ; and that He 
made all things out of nothing ; spe- 
cial emphasis being laid upon that 
passage of Scripture which reads, 



"No man hath seen God at any 
time." They were using this as a 
cudgel against the faith of those 
who believe that Joseph Smith did 
see God. I thought it rather queer 
that people who proclaim in effect 
that they know nothing about God, 
who declare that no man has ever 
seen Him, and that He cannot be 
comprehended, should be found here 
in our midst trying to tell us "The 
Truth about God." It looks a little 
ridiculous, and the folly of it is em- 
phasized, in our minds, by the fact 
that these people who admit that 
they know nothing about God, have 
come to teach the followers of a 
prophet who saw God, who con- 
versed with Him, and who taught 
the truth concerning Him — though 
not all. 

We do not believe (as Brother 
Penrose beautifully showed yester- 
day) that God ever made anything 
out of nothing. We dismiss that as 
an unphilosophical absurdity — for 
no power, human or divine, ever did 
or ever will make something out of 
nothing. I shall only glance, too, 
at the proposition that God is in- 
comprehensible. The unrevealed in- 
finite fulness of God is of course in- 
comprehensible to the finite mind. 
The finite cannot grasp the infinite. 
That being the case, God in his ful- 
ness is incomprehensible to us at the 
present time. He cannot reveal His 
fulness, because it cannot be com- 
prehended. The finite can no more 
comprehend the infinite, than the 
river can swallow up the ocean. But 
we do not claim that the infinite ful- 
ness of Gad has been revealed to 
man ; we only claim that a part of 
it has been revealed. But the part 
revealed is certainly not incompre- 
hensible — else why did God reveal 
it? If incomprehensible, how could 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



85 



He have revealed it? It is an ab- 
surdity to say that God has revealed 
Himself even in part, and then de- 
clare that He is' utterly incompre- 
hensible. It is charging Him with 
folly and a waste of time. 

As for God being a spirit, we do 
believe that — as President Smith 
forcibly reminded us on a former 
occasion. God is a spirit, and man 
is a spirit ; but man has a body, and 
so has God. Man is the child of God, 
fashioned in His image and en- 
dowed with divine attributes. Men 
and women are the sons and daugh- 
ters of heavenly Parents, who said 
in the beginning, "Let us make man 
in our own image — male and fe- 
male." That is not incomprehensi- 
ble, and the Lord never intended it 
to be ; but man has tried to make it 
so. We believe also in the Holy 
Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a person- 
age of spirit, the third member of 
the Godhead ; and there is a spirit or 
influence that proceeds from the di- 
vine presence and pervades the im- 
mensity of space. But that is not 
our Father in heaven, that is not our 
Savior, not the Father and the Son 
with whom Joseph Smith conversed 
and from whom he received instruc- 
tions. God revealed Himself to the 
Prophet in the visions of heaven by 
the power of His Spirit, and Joseph 
saw Him, not with the natural eye— 
for no man, with the natural eye, 
hath seen God at any time— but with 
his spiritual vision, reinforced by 
the power of God's Spirit, without 
which no man can see or compre- 
hend Him. 

We are dependent upon the Lord 
for this testimony, and I feel the 
need of it every day, every hour— 
the need of guidance by that Spirit 
which manfests the things of God, 
which brings things past to remem- 



brance, shows things to come, ex- 
plains the otherwise mysterious 
present, and puts within the hand of 
man the key to celestial glory, the 
power to lay hold upon eternal life, 
God's greatest gift. Amen. 

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Benefit to Sundays Schools of the 
presence of the Priesthood — Exces- 
sive number of meetings — Priest- 
hood classes may be held at such 
times as most convenient — No need 
to have organizations outside of the 
Church — All our energies needed 
within the Church of Christ. 

Before we adjourn for the after- 
noon session, I have a very few 
words to say to our brethren, the 
presidents of stakes, the bishops and 
their counselors, and the brethren 
acting in the priesthood, particular- 
ly, and the subject will to some ex- 
tent bear upon the whole congrega- 
tion. 

I made a few remarks at the close 
of the splendid session of the Sun- 
day School conference last evening 
in regard to the labors of the priest- 
hood in the Sunday Schools. We 
used to have, generally, in the dif- 
ferent wards of the stakes of Zion, 
priesthood meetings on Monday 
evenings. In many of the wards 
that has been changed, to holding 
priesthood classes on Sunday morn- 
ings, and I learn that in consequence 
of that in some places, the Sunday 
Schools are denuded, so to speak, of 
the influence and power and author- 
ity and presence of men holding the 
priesthood, men of experience. We 
have so many meetings to attend, 
particularly on Sunday, that instead 
of being a day of rest it becomes to 
some a day of toil. 

Now, it is not obligatory upon all 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the wards and stakes of Zion to 
make this change. If they find it 
better to have the priesthood meet- 
ings held on Monday evenings they 
are at liberty so to do, so far as the 
Presidency of the Church are con- 
cerned. What we want is to have 
the greatest good come to the great- 
est number ; and it is advisable that, 
so far as possible, the men who hold 
the Holy Priesthood, particularly 
men in authority, will by their pres- 
ence and their influence and their 
teachings, aid in the glorious work 
of teaching our young people — chil- 
dren and the teachers of the chil- 
dren, the things of God. So, it is 
advisable as far as possible, to have 
the brethren of the priesthood, if 
they hold their meeting on Sunday 
morning as classes in the priesthood, 
to remain and attend the Sunday 
Schools. But if they can't do both, 
they can make their arrangements, 
if they so desire, to have their priest- 
hood meetings as before on Monday 
evenings. This is not obligatory 
upon all the brethren because of the 
change that has taken place in some 
of the wards. In some wards it 
works well ; in others it does not 
work so well. Do that which is best, 
brethren, and all will be right. 

Now, in regard to having so many 
meetings, we are told by a great 
number of our brethren that about 
every night in the week they have 
some duty to perform, either as 
teachers or attending priesthood 
meetings or class meetings or some 
other meetings connected with the 
wards of the Church in which they 
reside. I would say then if that is 
the case, confine your time and your 
talents and your labor and work to 
the institutions of the Church. 
There is no need to go outside into 
other organizations established for 
other than Church purposes. The 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints contains within its or- 
ganization all that is needed for the 
labors of our brethren in the priest- 
hood, and for our sisters in their 
auxiliary societies, for the benefit of 
the Saints, for their uplifting, for 
their enlightenment, for their prog- 
ress, for the consolidation of their 
energies in any direction. So, 
brethren, the advice of the Presi- 
dency is to you, do not be entangled 
with orders, or societies, or outside 
and extra organizations that are be- 
ing attempted or set up, but bring 
your energies together inside the 
Church, its quorums, its organiza- 
tions of every kind, and you will 
have plenty to do. May God bless 
you and help you to do it. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced bv 
Elder Rey L. Pratt. 
Conference adjourned unto 2 p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m., President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excel- 
lent word! 
What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

The invocation was offered by 
Elder William H. Smart. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



87 



The congregation sang the hymn : 

ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow and the 
clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 
flee. 



ELDER DAVID O. M'KAY. 

God's laws should govern all life's 
affairs, trivial or great — War's hor- 
rors, like other evils, result from 
ignoring Divine laws — Duty of pro- 
claiming those laws rests upon the 
Priesthood — To be consistent, those 
who proclaim law must live it. 

I sincerely trust that I may be 
able to express what I have in my 
heart to say. To me, it seems im- 
portant and practical; but I rather 
fear that when I attempt to say it, 
it will seem to the Saints trivial and 
unimportant, so I pray that the in- 
spiration of this conference, the 
bessings "of the. Lord that have at- 
tended the brethren who have occu- 
pied this position before, may direct 
me this afternoon. 

The Gospel principles are glori- 
ous, they are divine, and I beiieve 
that there is not a soul in this house 
who does not believe that they are 
glorious and divine. Most of us 
know the source of these principles 
and these ordinances. We know 
that God is revealing and has re- 
vealed His will to men ; but the 
great important thing to me is, To 
what extent do we introduce these 
glorious principles into our lives. 
In other words, how do we apply 
our religion? We just sang the 
opening hymn, 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word; 



What more can He say than to you He 

hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge hath 

fled?" , y \ 

When we think of the revelations- 
He has given to the human family 
since the beginning of time, down to 
this last and greatest of dispensations 
in which He has revealed, through 
the greatest of prophets, revelations 
that are glorious and practical, when 
we contemplate, I say, all that God 
has given us, it does seem that we 
can say with the poet, "What more 
can He say than to you He hath 
said ?" But on the other hand, when 
we contemplate how little we apply 
these principles in our individual 
lives, in our civic lives, in our na- 
tional lives, we begin to realize how 
much more God has done for us 
than we are doing for Him. We 
should apply these principles, too, in 
what seem to be trivial things. 
There is no one great thing that we 
can do to obtain eternal life, and it 
seems to me that the great lesson to 
be learned in the world today is to 
apply in the little acts and duties of 
life the glorious principles of the 
Gospel. Let us not think that be- 
cause some of the things named this 
afternon.may seem small and trivial, 
that they are unimportant. Life, 
after all, is made up of little things. 
Our life, our being, physically, is 
made up here of little heart beats. 
Let that little heart stop beating, 
and life in this world ceases. The 
great sun is a mighty force in the 
universe, but we receive the bless- 
ings of his rays because they come 
to us as little beams, which, taken 
in the aggregate, fill the whole world 
with sunlight. The dark night is 
made pleasant by the glimmer of 
what seem to be little stars ; and so 
the true Christian life is made up of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



little Christ-like acts performed this 
hour, this minute, in the home, in 
the quorum, in the organization, in 
the town, wherever our life and acts 
may be cast. 

I want to call your attention to 
part of the farewell address that an 
aged man gave to his people many 
hundreds of years ago, for it seems 
to me that the power of that address 
as it influenced the people of his 
time is applicable to the world to- 
day. Many hundreds of years ago 
an old prophet, tried and proved by 
a life of service to God, gathered 
his people around him, related their 
history, and pointed out the hand of 
God over them, how He had pre- 
served them, led them through 
trials, temptations, delivered them 
from their enemies and blessed them 
time after time, notwithstanding 
their frequent departures from His 
will. Then He appealed to them 
to say whether or not they were 
going to serve Him, or whether 
after all the Lord had done for them 
they were going to fall back and 
worship false gods. They were so 
impressed that they cried out in 
their hearts, "The Lord, our God 
will we serve and His voice will we 
obey," and then Joshua, the aged 
prophet, gathered them around him 
and, under an old oak tree that 
stood close by the sanctuary, erected 
a pile of rocks which was to stand 
as a reminder of the covenant which 
they had that day made, and so long 
as they should see that, they were 
to remember the covenant which 
they had made ; they were going to 
serve God and His voice obey. 

Brethren, these conferences ap- 
peal to me as opportunities for us to 
renew our covenants. This confer- 
ence, particularly, is a time of re- 
freshing, a time of renewal of spirit, 
and an opportunity for all Israel to 



say after all they hear, after all they 
know to be true, "We will serve the 
Lord and His voice we will obey." 

I said that the great need of the 
world today is applied religion. 
When I think or read of the horrors 
of the most wicked of wars, now 
going on in Europe, when I picture 
young men who have been forced to 
carry the gun and slay their fellow- 
men, running across a field, burrow- 
ing into the earth as animals, to pro- 
tect themseves from their fellow- 
men, when I read of these men lying 
heaped in trenches, and in fancy 
hear their groans as they turn their 
o-hastly faces to heaven, when I 
think of the devastated towns and 
see fleeing from those towns hus- 
bandless women, dragging father- 
less children, when I think of the 
thousands of human beings who are 
going to die of starvation and dis- 
ease, — because we are told that for 
every soldier that dies in battle five 
others at least will die of exposure, 
disease and starvation — I say when 
I think of all these horrors that 
come in the wake of war, I try to 
find out the cause of it all. Each 
nation is calling its people to "Come 
to the defense of the nation, be- 
cause the war is forced upon us." 
Germany says, "We are forced to 
fight Austria says, "We are forced 
to fight ;" so France and England. 
As a matter of fact, thus far it 
seems clear that only the little nation 
of Belgium is forced to fight. They 
seem to have such right on their side 
-that they are fighting for their life, 
for their country, their God. But 
the real causes are not evident; 
however you will discover that one 
cause of the disastrous war lies 
deeply rooted in the fact that those 
highly so-called Christian nations 
have never applied the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

The leaders and rulers who 
brought this war upon the people 
failed to apply the little, simple 
principles that Christ taught centur- 
ies ago. Why, if they had applied 
only one of His teachings the whole 
war might have been averted. For 
example, "If you bring your gift 
to the altar and there rememberest 
that thou hast aught against thy 
brother, leave there thy gift upon 
the altar and go first to thy brother ; 
first reconcile thyself to him, then 
come and offer thy sacrifice." If 
the first two nations that clashed, 
because af having misunderstood 
each other, had applied that little 
simple doctrine and live it, may be 
the whole thing would have been 
averted for a time. But that is only 
one. The roots of the causes of 
this war lie deeply bedded in vanity, 
one monarch feeling above another, 
so far above him, in fact, that he 
would not arbitrate, would not go 
to his brother and have an under- 
standing of the misunderstandings 
that had risen. Vanity, selfishness, 
unjust commercialism, unrighteous- 
ness, and other things contrary to, 
the Spirit of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. O, if they could only apply 
the Gospel in their nationalism ! But 
they have considered it only as a 
thing appart from daily life — as 
something to be treated as a mere 
social function. They haven't felt 
that it is a vital force, the vital force 
in humanity. 

It may be that this dreadful 
carnage which is going on — the top- 
pling of thrones, the destruction of 
monarchies, may be but a step to 
prepare the way 'for the preaching 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
the giving to the millions of honest 
souls in those countries the oppor- 
tunity of accepting it. I, for one, 
believe it with all my soul. Upon 



whom, then, rests the responsibility 
of carrying this message to them, 
after the way is prepared? Upon 
whom but those unto whom has 
been given the power and authority 
to represent God in this \wfc>rld? 
That is you, my brother ; that is you, 
my sister. How glorious the Gos- 
pel seems to us ; but oh, how mighty 
the responsibility upon the Elders of 
the Church ! The first step toward 
carrying this responsibility is to ap- 
ply our religion in our lives. 

Did you notice the last part of 
President Smith's impressive prayer 
last night in the Sunday School Un- 
ion ? Read it after this meeting and 
see how his heart went out and 
prayed that we might have the spirit 
of peace in our hearts. That is the 
true beginning of peace. When we 
talk to the world about the need of 
applying religion, our first duty is 
to apply it in our lives. 

Let us see what this means. In 
one of our meetings recently, Presi- 
dent Lyman said, in substance, "I 
believe, that there was never a time 
when it was more necessary to teach 
to the people the necesisty of ab- 
staining from the use of tobacco, in- 
toxicants and s timulating bever- 
ages." In other words, though for 
many years we have heard the word 
of wisdom taught, yet it is still just 
as necessary to teach it to the Saints. 
The word of wisdom is a simple lit- 
tle thing, isn't it, but if we could say 
to the world that here in the west 
there are one hundred thousand peo- 
ple not one of whom indulges in 
intoxicants, not one of whom has 
violated the law of chastity, what 
would it mean ? To accomplish this 
among Latter-day Saints isn't im- 
practical. Let us particularize : 
Here are these men in the leading 
counsels of the Church who sub- 
scribe to those things. There are 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sixty-six presidencies and sixty-six 
stake cerks of whom the same can 
be truthfully said. There are sixty- 
six times eighteen who ought to do 
it ; and if they cannot, they are not 
true to the responsibility which they 
have accepted. If those men can do 
it, cannot the seven hundred and 
twenty-five times three men who oc- 
cupy the bishoprics in this Church, 
do it ? They must do it. They have 
said they would do it. If these men 
can comply with these requirements 
because of the offices they hold and 
the responsibilities that are before 
them as leaders in Israel, cannot 
the men who occupy positions in the 
quorums do it? Why. Bishops, you 
ask them to when you put them in, 
and each man can do it if he will 
only desire to. If he will only say 
in his heart, "I love to do it because 
it is true, because it is my duty." Do 
you realize what it means to have 
the Priesthood — all the men who 
hold responsibility, live temperate, 
chaste and righteous lives? Sixty- 
six stake presidencies and clerks ag- 
gregate twti hundred and sixty-four 
men ; Higii Counselors, eleven hun- 
dred eighty-eight ; seven hundred 
and twenty-five Bishoprics, includ- 
ing the ward clerk, twenty-nine hun- 
dred ; Deacons, just the officers and 
class instructors, about twenty-nine 
hundred ; Teachers and Priests, ap- 
proximately, fourteen hundred and 
fifty; three hundred and fifty quor- 
ums of Elders, each one presided 
over by three men who carry the re- 
sponsibility of pure living just as 
much as the Bishopric of the ward, 
one thousand and fifty ; there will be 
seven hundred class instructors with 
those Elders, every one of whom is 
an unfit teacher unless he teaches by 
his life ; one hundred and ninety 
quorums of Seventy, thirteen hun- 
dred and thirty men ; sixty-six quor- 



ums of High Priests, one hundred 
and ninety-eight, with seven hun- 
dred and twenty-five class instruc- 
tors ; making a grand total of over 
twelve thousand men, every one of 
whom has the strength and I hope 
he has the love to live up to those 
principles and to apply them in his 
daily life. Or, to approach the 
question another way. Since the 
year, 1900, over ten thousand young 
men in this Church have gone out 
to the nations to preach the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. Those young men 
have stood on the streets of some 
of these nations now in war; they 
have stood on the street corners in 
our own cities here in America, and 
have declared the eternal principles 
of the Gospel revealed through the 
Prophet, Joseph Smith. Those ten 
thousand young men during that 
time were clean and pure and sweet 
in their lives, or else they were hyp- 
ocrites. Now, they have come back 
and are mingling here in our social 
life, in our political life; some of 
them are on the road acting as 
drummers. Are they applying these 
Gospel principles? There are ten 
thousand young men on whom the 
responsibility rests to apply these 
influences in their lives. And we 
may add others. There are the 
teachers in the auxiliary associa- 
aions. Do you want a girl to teach 
your children in Sunday School who 
does not live a life of purity, a con- 
sistent life in her home and in so- 
ciety? Why, the responsibility is 
upon the girls just as much as it as 
upon the men. And when you class 
just the teachers, eliminating the 
general boards, eliminating the 
Ward teachers, eliminating the 
membership of quorums, — which 
ought not to be done, — we have an 
army of fifty thousand teachers, men 
and women, every one of whom can 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



91 



apply this principle in daily life and 
every one of whom should do it. 
Think of it! Suppose that during 
1915 and the remaining part of this 
year each one of those fifty thousand 
teachers touches the life of five boys 
and girls, only five, and influence 
those boys and girls to practice ab- 
solutely a life of temperate living 
and of chastity and of devotion to 
the principles of life — for that is 
what the Gospel is, principles of life, 
salvation here, happiness here, as 
well as hereafter — we should then 
have a community of two hundred 
and fifty thousand people applying 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I think 
such a condition not impracticable, 
to obtain ; for most of them are liv- 
ing it now, and the Gospel truths 
are dearer to them than life. 

Let us go from this conference 
feeling in our hearts as Israel of old 
felt, we will serve the Lord and His 
voice we will obey. God help us 
to do it, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

Had it been suggested yesterday, 
my brethren and sisters, that I ad- 
dress you this afternoon I should 
have thought it impossible, for I 
have been suffering because of 
bodily conditions to an extent that 
it would have been very painful for 



me to have attempted to do so, but 
I feel very grateful to the Lord, and 
give Him credit, that I am so far 
relieved from pain that with His as- 
sistance and your faith I am able to 
occupy a few moments of the time. 

I believe in the Lord. I believe 
in the vital forces which character- 
ize His Gospel, and apply to all 
those who put their faith in Him ; 
and so I depend upon Him as I have 
all my life. Whatever I do I think of 
the Lord, and my utter dependence 
upon Him for strength to accomp- 
lish it. So I feel very grateful this 
afternoon, my brethren and sisters, 
and wish to make this acknowledg- 
ment here in your presence, that my 
life has been prolonged and pre- 
served until today ; that your lives 
have been preserved ; that we are 
permitted through His mercy and 
goodness to come up here again as 
we are wont to do, to worship the 
Lord, to bear witness of His good- 
ness to us, to review the condition of 
the Church, to compare our prog- 
ress, our development, our work, 
with the words of His servants, the 
prophets, that we may know wheth- 
er or not we are in harmony with 
that which the Lord expects us to 
accomplish. 

I feel very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for my membership in 
the Church, for the testimony which 
has come to me, and which has been 
so convincing that I do not remem- 
ber a moment in my life, either my 
mature life or my childhood, when I 
have ever doubted, when my faith 
in the Lord has ever wavered. I be- 
lieve in Him and recognize Him 
as the Creator of the earth upon 
which I dwell, the organizer of the 
universe with which we are sur- 
rounded, the Father of my spirit and 
the spirits of all men, and that He 
did send in the meridian of time His

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



only begotten Son that we might see 
God in the flesh as He was mani- 
fested in our Lord, Jesus Christ, 
with the doctrines of the everlast- 
ing Gospel which have been taught 
aforetime, through obedience to 
which men and women might be 
brought back into His presence. I 
believe in these things, my brethren 
and sisters, with all my heart. 

I thank the Lord for the written 
word which we have that is con- 
tained in the scripture ; that He has 
sent prophets into every dispensa- 
tion of the world. From the time 
that this earth was created and man- 
kind began to inhabit it the Lord 
has been very near to His children. 
He has always guided them or 
sought to guide them in the right 
way. He has revealed Himself to 
them through His servants. Proph- 
ecy does not come to us simply that 
we may know that which is to trans- 
pire. The Lord sends inspired men 
to outline to us the future in order 
that, having that knowledge we may 
be brought to repentance ; that we 
may avoid, by repentance, the in- 
evitable judgments which come to 
men because of their wickedness-; 
that we may become partakers of 
the blessings which are vouchsafed 
to all those who repent and serve the 
Lord. This is the purpose of proph- 
ecy, this is the spirit of prophecy, 
and the prophets have always been 
with God's children from the besrin- 
nmg of time, and they are with 
them today to warn and admonish 
them and to point out to them the 
way in which they should walk. A 
prophet is not only one who foretells 
events that are to come, but one 
who, inspired of the Lord, instructs 
people in that which they ought to 
do in the day of their own probation, 
that they may be brought back into 
the presence of the Lord. 



It never has been very popular 
to be a prophet. I am reminded of 
that; from the very beginning the 
inclination of man seems to have 
been to disbelieve in the Lord, to 
drift away from Him and to treat 
lightly the admonitions which have 
come to them through His servants. 
When Noah preached repentance to 
the antediluvians, warning them of 
their wickedness, there were only a 
few who believed. O, he was a 
visionary man ; the earth would not 
be submerged with water; they 
would not be destroyed; and they 
laughed him to scorn ; but there 
were just a few who had sufficient 
faith to believe in him and be saved. 
Only a few people believed in the 
Redeemer, notwithstanding the fact 
that they professed faith in the 
scripture and that His coming had 
been clearly outlined, the time, the 
place, the manner, there were just a 
few wise men, who understood the 
signs of the times, who came and 
did homage to the Babe of Beth- 
lehem. The world at large rejected 
Him. The Jews rejected His doc- 
trines, they were not warned by 
those signs which were manifest 
clearly before their very eyes, and 
they rejected the Lord. They knew 
not of His coming, and rejected His 
doctrines and ridiculed Him and 
scorned Him and finally crucified 
Him. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 1 
might go on and recount many suck 
instances. There have been times 
when people have listened to the 
words of the prophet and through 
obedience and repentance have been 
saved. When Jonah went down to 
Ninevah and warned those people 
that because of their wickedness the 
judgment of the Almighty hung 
over them and that they would be 
destroyed except they should repent, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 9 



they were pricked in their hearts 
and did repent. They fasted before 
the Lord; they clothed themselves 
in sackcloth and threw ashes upon 
their heads and cried mightily to 
the Lord for forgiveness ; and He 
heard them just as He always hears 
those who turn to Him. It was not 
that the deluge had been irrevocably 
decreed; it was not that the Lord 
desired the destruction of multitudes 
of men who were on the earth ; not 
at all. He desired their redemption, 
that they should repent, and had 
they repented of their sins and 
turned to Him, there would have 
been rejoicing in the heavens. That 
generation of men would have been 
redeemed ; but they refused to listen, 
acting upon the agency which the 
Lord had given them. That is what I 
want to call your attention to, my 
brethren and sisters, that prophecy 
is given to us that we may profit by 
it, and by having fore-knowledge of 
those things which are to come, we 
may so square our lives that we will 
be prepared for them. So it is not 
very strange that this latter dispen- 
sation, in which the restoration of 
the Gospel had been just as clearly 
outlined as had been the dispensa- 
tion of Christ, our Savior, should be 
revealed by the Lord, through His 
servants, the prophets. He revealed 
it to John, the divine, upon the Isle 
of Patmos : He revealed it to Isa- 
iah and others of His prophets, the 
time, the place and the manner of 
the restoration, and we know as we 
know that we live, that through the 
instrumentality of Joseph Smith, 
just a boy, but a boy chosen of 
the Lord and loved of Him, that 
this latter Gospel dispensation has 
been ushered in, as the Lord said 
it would be. 

The world does not believe this. 
They will never believe it except 



they shall turn from their wicked- 
ness and do the will of the Lord. 
But that does not change the truth 
at all. We bear witness of it to the 
world. I bear witness of it here this 
afternoon, that Joseph Smith was 
and is today the prophet of this dis- 
pensation, the chosen instrument of 
the Lord, through whom by the 
agency of that angel that was to fly 
through heaven, seen of John, the 
Revelator, the Gospel has been re- 
stored to earth, that its inhabitants 
may be warned and brought to re- 
pentance if they are to avoid the 
judgments of the Almighty which 
hangs over them. Not because He 
has declared that they shall be de- 
stroyed, not at all. He does not love 
war; and there would be rejoicing 
if the nations would repent; but 
without repentance, without humil- 
ity, unless they shall .acknowledge 
Him and acknowledge the restora- 
tion of the Gospel in this dispensa- 
tion, through these agencies to 
which I referred, there can come no 
salvation for them. 

Nearly thirty years before it oc- 
curred, Joseph Smith predicted the 
great civil war which should occur 
in our own country. Well, the un- 
believer says, "Any far-seeing man 
might have known that the South- 
ern states would be divided against 
the Northern states and there would 
be war." But the prophet states 
more than that. He told us just 
where the war would begin. He told 
us just what the result would be, 
and has the sequel not proven that 
that war began just as this revela- 
tion said it would begin, in South 
Carolina? We might have some 
reason to doubt or to question the 
inspiration of this prophet of the 
Lord, if during that war the South- 
ern states had not called upon Great 
Britain for assistance. There might 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be some reason to doubt if in a 
single detail there had been a mis- 
take, but it chanced that the South- 
ern states did call upon Great Brit- 
ain, and we were very nearly at 
war with that nation because of her 
participation in behalf of the Con- 
federacy in that struggle. 

So, my brethren and sisters, you 
may read the word of the Lord as 
it is contained in these books and 
there you will find outlined for your 
benefit, that you may be governed 
by it, the destiny of all the nations 
of "the earth. Now, we are not so 
much interested in the deluge, we 
are not so much interested in things 
that occurred in the meridian of 
time, although they are of very great 
interest to us, as we are in the word 
of the Lord as it applies to the pres- 
ent. We are here in peace today: 
thank the Lord for it. We pray for 
peace! we desire it. I want to say 
to you that all the prayers that we 
offer for peace, however great our 
desires may be, will not stay the 
judgments of the Almighty which 
hang over this nation as they hang 
over the nations of the old world, 
except repentance shall come to it, 
and faith in God, our Father. 

There is no land in the world, no 
people upon earth to M-hom greater 
promises have been made than this 
nation of which we form a part. 
There is no part of the earth's sur- 
face of which the Lord has said 
more plainlv and with greater em- 
phasis than He has of this.that it is a 
land choice above all other lands. 
There is no other place where He 
has said with greater emphasis that 
it is His eternal and irrevocable de- 
cree that whatever nation or people 
shall inhabit this promised land shall 
serve Him, the true and the living 
God, or they shall be removed from 
it. There is no nation to which He 



has made greater promises than the 
nation of which we form a part, and 
which exists here today. Neither is 
there any other nation that He was 
warned more plainly than He has 
this nation. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let 
us look the situation squarely in the 
face. We see the ravages of war in 
the old world. They have been re- 
ferred to here. I want to admonish 
my brothers and sisters and I want 
to admonish this nation to read the 
word of the Lord, to believe in this 
book, the Book of Mormon, which 
is the scripture of this American 
continent, and which contains the 
irrevocable decrees of the Al- 
mighty as they apply to this land, 
that they may, by coming into pos- 
session of this knowledge, avoid the 
pitfalls which are before them. 

It is not my purpose, not my in- 
tention to make lengthy remarks. 
W e are living in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. My brethren 
and sisters, I would like to read here 
just a few words, the words of the 
Savior, and which apply very di- 
rectly to us and to this nation : 

"Ye say that ye know .that the 
end of the world cometh, ye say also that 
ye know that the heavensi and the earth 
shall pass away; 

"And in this ye say truly, for so 
it is; but these things which I have 
told you shall not pass away until all 
shall be fulfilled. 

"And this I have told you concern- 
ing Jerusalem; and when that day 
shall come, shall a remnant be scat- 
tered among all nations; 

"But they shall be gathered again, 
but they shall remain until the times 
of the Gentiles be fulfilled." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, fol- 
low me a little further. 

"And in that day shall be heard of 
wars and rumors of wars, and the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



95 



whole earth shall be ' in commotion, 
and men's hearts shall fail them, and 
they shall say that Christ delayeth 
His coming until the end of the earth. 

"And the love of men shall wax 
cold, and iniquity shall abound; 

"And when the times of the Gentiles 
is come in, a light shall break forth 
among them that sit in darkness, and 
it shall be the fullness of My Gospel; 

"But they receive it not, for they 
perceive not the light and they turn 
their hearts from Me because of the 
precepts of men ; 

"And in that generation shall the 
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." 

That light has broken forth with 
the restoration of the Gospel 
through Joseph Smith, the prophet. 
That prophecy was fulfilled but they 
perceive not the light, recognize it 
no more than did the Jews perceive 
the light when Christ ministered 
among them, or the antediluvians 
believe the words of Noah, or the 
Nephites the words of Samuel, the 
prophet, or the Jaredites the words 
of Ether, but they went on in their 
wickedness and transgression until 
by their own acts they brought down 
upon themselves the judgment and 
indignation of an offended God. 

I say unto you, my brethren and 
sisters, the time has come in this na- 
tion when the Lord will have its 
people to serve Him — to turn from, 
their profanity, to turn from their 
blasphemy which we hear wherever 
we go, and honor the name of' God, 
our Father, and serve Him and keep 
His commandments; a time when 
their whoredoms must cease, when 
they must cease to corrupt the foun- 
tains of life and yield obedience to 
that first command in honorable 
marriage, increase and multiply and 
replenish the earth, as God designed 
that His children should do from the 
beginning; a time when they must 
cease from their drunkenness and 
abolish from among them those 



things which corrupt men and de- 
base them and make them easy vic- 
tims to the wiles of the adversary; 
a time when the rich must cease to 
persecute and bear down upon the 
poor, a time when the poor must in 
humility recognize and acknowledge 
the Lord and, without envy, treat 
properly those who have been 
blessed more greatly than they with 
the necessities of life; a time when 
the legislators who frame the law, 
must, in righteousness before the 
Lord, seek the enactment of right- 
eous laws; and a time when the 
judges who execute the law must be 
incorruptible and not to be pur- 
chased with money, or because of 
the love of the world's honor, cor- 
rupt the trust that is reposed in 
them. In other words, a time when 
all men, those who profess faith, 
those who profess it not, must turn 
unto God, and except they return I 
bear witness that God's judgment is 
hanging over them and that it will 
fall upon them. All men upon this 
earth must come to recognize the 
Lord and acknowledge His Son, 
Jesus Christ, if they would be saved 
from the judgments which are to 
come. 

God bless you, brethren and sis- 
ters, keep us in the faith, increase 
our testimony, give us strength that 
we may bear this witness before the 
world, that when the Lord's judg- 
ments come, our garments may be 
clean of the blood of this generation, 
because of having fulfilled this great 
mission of ours, to be witnesses of 
the Lord, testifying of the import- 
ance and truth of His written word, 
and the word uttered by His ser- 
vants ; for just as prophetic words 
have been uttered in the past, so 
does that prophetic spirit exist in the 
Church today through His servants 
who preside over us. I bear witness

of this and pray that the Spirit of 
the Lord may help us to bear wit- 
ness of it in all the world, that the 
people may be brought to repentance 
and God's judgments averted, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

"Christian" ministers denying divinity 
of Christ's earthly birth — Implicit 
faith in Christ characteristic of Lat- 
ter-day Saints — Scriptures abound 
with testimony of Christ's divinity, 
and resurrection — Personal revela- 
ton of Christ to man in this age. 

I desire to bear testimony to the 
words of counsel and instruction 
which we have received during this 
conference, and commend them to 
the Latter-day Saints, and pray that 
they put them into practice, that we 
may stand united in the keeping of 
the commandments of the Lord and 
the covenants we have made with 
Him. 

Like my brethren who have 
spoken, I too realize and know that 
the time must come when every knee 
must bow and every tongue confess 
that Jesus is the Christ. I was im- 
pressed by the remarks this morning 
by Elder Orson F. Whitney, in 
which he called to our attention the 
fact that/the Spirit of the Lord has 
been given unto us, even the Holy 
Spirit of promise, and therefore we 
may know the truth and walk in the 
light and understanding of the Gos- 
pelj While he was speaking, my 
mind dwelt upon a statement that 
was made some few months since by 
a certain minister who has a high 
standing in the Christian world, not 
only in this land, but also through- 
out Europe, for his learning and his 
ability as a public speaker. This man 
has been trained and educated in 
the colleges of the land, according 



to the customs and the theories 
prevalent at the present time in so- 
called Christian institutions, to in- 
terpret the* scriptures, and is now a 
Doctor of Divinity. Yet this 
gentleman who has received this 
training and standing amibng his 
fellows, made the startling declara- 
tion in one of his discourses several 
months ago that he did not adhere 
to and would not support the doc- 
trine of the miraculous conception 
and birth of Christ. "My con- 
clusion upon the question," he an- 
nounced, "is that the faith of Mark 
and John, and James and Paul, is 
good enough for me, it is good 
enough for any Christian. These 
men say nothing about Jesus hav- 
ing come into the world in a mir- 
aculous manner, and I prefer to 
stand with them. What do we 
mean by saying He was divine? It 
is a question of quantity and not of 
quality. There is divinity in us ; 
but so much more in Him that I 
prefer to call Him divine. Perhaps 
it would be better to speak of the 
divineness of man and the divin- 
ity of Christ." In other discourses 
in keeping with this, this gentle- 
man denied the resurrection from 
the dead. He denied that Jesus 
came forth from the tomb. He de- 
nied, as he has in this statement I 
have read, that Jesus was the only 
begotten Son of God. He set forth 
the idea that He was the son of 
Joseph and Mary, and that there is 
no resurrection from the dead. Be- 
cause of his doctrine which was 
boldly declared, there was some op- 
position raised among his fel- 
low ministers, for he stood as the 
President of the Federation of Min- 
isters in the city where he preached 
in one of the fashionable churches. 
Action was brought against him by 
those who did not accept these 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



97 



views, to have him relieved of his 
position as President of the Minis- 
terial Federation. The case was 
heard and the man reiterated his ex- 
pressions, declaring that while he 
was preaching in the city of New 
York and in London, where he rep- 
resented another denomination 
whose doctrines, in part at least, 
were different from those of the or- 
ganization he now represented, he 
had been far more emphatic and 
had spoken more clearly in favor of 
these doctrines for which he had 
now been called in question. The 
matter of his resignation was put to 
vote and seventy-four of the minis- 
ters voted in his favor while but 
nineteen voted that he should be re- 
quested to resign. 

I think this is a startling situa- 
tion, in a community professing to 
believe in the mission of Jesus 
Christ and professing to be Chris- 
tian in doctrine, f Could a member 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, called to be a 
minister to the people — a Bishop of 
a ward, a President of a Stake, or 
one occupying a .position in any other 
capacity — go forth among the peo- 
ple declaring that he did not be- 
lieve- that Jesus was the Christ, the 
Son of God, and denying His great 
and glorious mission in the world, 
and hold his position ? No ! Be- 
cause it is in opposition to the very 
foundation of Christianity. It is 
contrary to the Gospel and teach- 
ings of the Redeemer of the world. 
It contradicts His entire life, and 
ministry and is destructive of faith 
in Plis name. Any officer in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints who should put forth 
such a declaration would very soon 
be relieved of his responsibility.,/ 

This minister, notwithstanding 
his learning and degrees received in 



colleges to qualify him as a minister 
of the Gospel, presumes to declare 
that he stands on the same ground 
as "Mark and John, and James and 
Paul," none of whom, so he de- 
clares, has testified of the miracu- 
lous birth of Jesus of Nazareth. 
Little does he understand the scrip- 
tures ! Little does he understand 
the teachings of these worthy dis- 
ciples of the Master as they have 
declared tfiem in their writings in 
the scriptures. He has no concep- 
tion of the doctrines of true Chris- 
tianity when he declares that Jesus 
is not the Son of God ; that there is 
no resurrection of the dead, and 
that we are not redeemed from our 
sins through the blood of Christ, for 
this is the foundation of Christi- 
anity. Destroy these teachings and 
what is left ? Any; man who denies 
these great truths is in the gall of 
bitterness and gross darkness con- 
cerning the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
It is no wonder, however, that blind 
teachers will hold to these ideas, for 
they are without the Spirit of God, 
and therefore, I suppose, we can af- 
ford to be charitable unto them and 
pity them. Why, the Savior Him- 
self has very clearly taught, as it is 
recorded by these very witnesses of 
whom this gentleman speaks, that 
He is the Son of God. He taught 
His disciples to pray to the Father 
in His name, and that He and the 
Father are one. He said He came 
into the world to do the will of the 
Father and not to do His own will, 
and that as the only begotten Son 
of God He came to redeem us from 
our sins. This was His great mis- 
sion. You will remember having 
read that on one occasion while He 
was on His way to Jerusalem it was 
reported to Him that Lazarus, a 
faithful follower in the city of Beth- 
any, was dead. And as He ap- 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



proached the city which was near 
to Jerusalem, He was met by 
Martha, a sister of the man who 
was dead, and the following conver- 
sation took place: 

"Then said Martha unto Jesus, 
Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my 
brother had not died. 

"But I know, that even now, what- 
soever thou will ask of God, God 
will give it Thee. 

"Jesus said unto her, Thy brother 
shall rise again. 

"Martha said unto Him, I know 
that he shall rise again in the resur- 
rection at the last day. 

"Jesus said unto her, I am the resur- 
rection, and the life: he that believeth 
in Me, though he were died, yet shall 
he live: 

"And whosoever liveth and believeth 
in Me shall never die. Believeth thou 
this? 

"She said unto Him, Yea, Lord: I 
believe that Thou art the Christ, _ the 
Son of God, which should come into 
the world." 

This is the testimony of the 
scriptures, the testimony of John, 
the testimony of James, of Paul and 
Mark and all others who have testi- 
fied, whose word is published in the 
scriptures. How a man can stand 
up and say that they have not testi- 
fied of these things, seems to me a 
mystery. 

(We accept Jesus as the Redeemer 
of the world. We know, as it was 
testified to us this morning, that He 
revealed Himself in this dispensa- 
tion. We are not dependent upon 
the testimonies of these ancient 
worthies, who lived in His day and 
conversed with Him in His minis- 
try, and to whom He appeared after 
His resurrection. We have wit- 
nesses who have lived in our own 
day, who have seen Him, who knew 
that He lives and have testified to 
us and to the world of this fact. We 
know their testimonies are true. Jo- 
seph Smith was not left alone to 



bear witness in this dispensation of 
the mission of Jesus Christ, for the 
Lord raised up other witnesses who, 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith, saw 
the Redeemer, received instruction 
from Him and beheld Him in the 
heavens sitting on the right hand 
side of the Father surrounded by 
the holy angels. They have given us 
their testimony which shall stand 
against the world to condemn all 
those who heed it not. But neither 
are we dependent as members of the 
Church upon the testimonies of Jo- 
seph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sid- 
ney Rigdon or any others now dead, 
who in this dispensation received 
wonderful revelations and visions 
from the Lord by which they knew 
that Jesus lives and is the Redeemer 
of the world. We have an indi- 
vidual testimony given through the 
Spirit of the Lord to all who have 
lived in accordance with the Gos- 
pel. If we have been in harmony 
with the truth after having been 
baptized for the remission of our 
sins, and confirmed by the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Spirit, the Lord has revealed unto 
us individually that these things are 
true. We are not dependent upon 
the testimony of anyone else for this 
knowledge for we know through the 
Spirit that Jesus is the Christ, the 
Redeemer of the world. ^ 

In conclusion, let me read to you 
one testimony that was given of 
the Savior many hundreds of years 
ago. I read from the second chap- 
ter of II Nephi, in the Book of Mor- 
mon, beginning with the latter part 
of the fourth verse : 

"And the way is prepared from the 
fall of man, and salvation is free. 

"And men are instructed sufficiently, 
that they know good from evil. And 
the law is given unto men. And by 
the law, no flesh is justified; or, by the 
law, men are cut off. Yea, by the 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



99 



temporal law, they were cut off; and 
also, by the spiritual law they perish 
from that which is good, and become 
miserable for ever. 

"Wherefore, redemption cometh in 
and through the Holy Messiah; for He 
is full of grace and truth. 

"Behold He offered Himself a sacri- 
fice for sin, to answer the ends of the 
law, unto all those who have a broken 
heart and a contrite spirit; and unto 
none else can the ends of the law be 
answered. 

"Wherefore, how great the import- 
ance to make these things known unto 
the inhabitants of the earth, that they 
may know that there is no flesh that 
can dwell in the presence of God, save 
it be through the merits, and mercy, 
and grace of the Holy Messiah, who 
layeth down His life, according to the 
flesh, and taketh it again by the power 
of the Spirit, that He may bring to 
pass the resurrection of the dead, be- 
ing the first that should rise. 

"Wherefore He is the first fruits 
unto God, inasmuch as He shall make 
intercession for all the children of 
men; and they that believe in Him 
shall be saved." 

This was uttered nearly six hun- 



dred years before the birth of Christ 
in the flesh. This is the testimony 
of every Latter-day Saint today 
unto the world, for we know that 
these things are true ; that Jesus is 
the Redeemer of the world and 
there is no other name given under 
the heavens by which men can be 
saved but that of Jesus Christ. The 
Lord bless you, my brethren and 
sisters in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burn- 
ing! 

The latter-dav glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are 
returning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Thomas Hull. 

Conference adjourned until Tues- 
day, Oct. 6th, at 10 a. m.

THIRD DAY. 



Conference was resumed in the 
Tabernacle, at 10 a. m., Tuesday, 
October 6th ; President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Elder Joseph R. Shepherd of- 
fered the invocation. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform; 
He plants His footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

The hand of God in all things — God 
not responsible for sin — Not all 
things are according to His will — 
Prayer not of the lips — The fore- 
knowledge of God not a determining 
cause — Are we on the Lord's side? 

In a revelation given to Joseph, 
the Prophet, in 1831, the Lord said: 

"In nothing doth man offend God 
or against none is His .wrath kin- 
dled save those who confess not His 
hand in all things, and obey not His 
commandments. Behold this is ac- 
cording to the law and the prophets. 
* * * I, the Lord, have spoken 
it, and the Spirit beareth record. 
Amen." (Doc. and Cov. 59 :21.) 

I take it that the confession there- 
in declared to be essential to a God- 



fearing life is not a confession in 
words alone, but genuine acknowl- 
edgment of the hand of God as 
manifest in the lives and actions of 
men. There is a very general ten- 
dency today to relegate God to the 
background in human affairs, to 
consider that He has no voice in our 
doings and in this course the Lord 
hath declared Himself and thus 
makes plain to us that His anger is 
aroused against those unfilial chil- 
dren of His who forget Him ; for 
the man who forgets the living God 
turns to idolatry, and having once 
known God and turned away from 
Him he is worse than the heathen 
who has never known other gods 
than those of wood and stone. I be- 
lieve in my heart that many of us 
are prone to lead relatively Godless 
lives. I speak of the human family, 
not of this people distinctively. 
Many of us, children of God, forget 
our Father, forget what He has 
done for us, what He is doing for 
us ; forget how truly we depend up- 
on Him for all that we have and all 
that we are ; and those who do so 
are great offenders in the eyes of 
the Lord. For He doth hate in- 
gratitude and He doth hate pride 
that lifts man in his own estimation 
and causes him to look around upon 
the things that God hath given and 
say to himself, as said the Babylo- 
nian king, "All these things have I 
made; all this wealth have I gath- 
ered ; all these great buildings have 
I erected ;" and be it remembered 
the Lord smote him in His anger 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



101 



and reduced him to the level of a 
beast in his capacities and faculties. 

The Lord's hand is in our lives ; 
if we will but feel for it, in the dark- 
ness, we can grasp it and be lifted 
thereby. Nevertheless, the Lord will 
permit those to deny Him who 
choose so to do. For to such end 
was the decree in the great council 
of the angels and the Gods, when 
the proffered services of Lucifer, a 
son of the morning, were rejected, 
and the offer of the well beloved 
Son was accepted, that man should 
be free — free to choose the path 
that shall bring him back into the 
presence of His Father, clothed with 
glory, because of His victory over 
sin, with immortality through the 
redeeming sacrifice of the Lord 
Jesus, and with eternal life as the 
supreme gift of God, or he may 
choose the path that will lead him 
into the company, there to abide 
forever, -of the devil and his angels. 
Among our human weaknesses we 
must reckon the tendency, mani- 
fest in some degree, perhaps, in the 
lives of most of us, to place the 
blame for our misdeeds on some- 
body else. When our "conscience 
pricks us and we begin to realize in 
a small measure our weaknesses, 
imperfections and shortcomings, we 
are very prone to excuse ourselves 
by citing what others are doing, 
what others have done; and it is 
only when the Spirit of God con- 
victeth us of sin that we feel to take 
the blame upon ourselves and cry 
out in our hearts as did the peni- 
tent, pentecostal multitude, "What 
shall we do to be saved?" 

The Scripture I have quoted is to 
be interpreted in the light of rea- 
son, common sense, if you please. 
There are some who interpret it 
selfishly and in a wholly unwar- 
ranted manner. Some go so far as 



to say that the hand of God being 
in all things, God Himself is re- 
sponsible for all that is, and for all 
that takes place. I have heard it 
taught by advocates of a frivolous 
theology that whatever is, is in ac- 
cordance with the will of God, that 
all we see is as He would have it 
be. My whole soul revolts against 
any such conception as that. I can- 
not believe that it is God's will that 
men shall be as they are in sin. I 
cannot believe that it is according to 
the will of God that vice walks our 
streets and stalks through the land ; 
that dishonesty, and drunkenness, 
and the spirit of murder are ram- 
pant in the land. Do not hold God 
accountable for such things ; do not 
•acknowledge His hand in the sense 
of placing the blame upon Him, but 
acknowledge His hand in the free 
agency that is thus given to men 
and in His power to eventually 
bring good out of all this evil. The 
warring nations are severally voic- 
ing prayers to God, prayers for 
what ? For the right ? No, for tri- 
umph, for the success of their arms, 
whether they t>e fighting on the side 
of right or on the side of wrong. 
Someone has suggested, with what 
I may call sacrilegious humor, that 
it would be better perchance if the 
nations would confess their idolatry 
and each one of them pray to his 
own god. It would be more con- 
venient, said a grim humorist re- 
cently, for each nation to have the 
exclusive attention and services of 
some deity. Thus one of them 
might pray to Baal, and another to 
Ashtoreth, and another to Moloch, 
and yet another to Dagon, and so 
to all the gods that men have made 
for themselves. We are striving 
not only in a national capacity, but 
in the capacity of individuals, for 
triumph rather than for truth, for 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



selfish success, rather than for the 
vindication of the right and for the 
furtherance of righteousness. Is it 
God who leads men to contend with 
one another? Is it God who leads 
nations to fight with one another? 
It is when the Spirit of God is with- 
drawn from men that they fight. It 
is when the Lord hath hidden His 
face from the nations that they go 
to war. Yet out of it all He can 
cause to rise the principles of truth. 
As the crystal forms in the brine, 
He can cause the principles of 
righteousness to crystallize out from 
the gory magma which is presented 
to us by this terrible conflict. 

We, as a people, profess to be a 
prayerful people. I ask you sever- 
ally, and you may answer to your 
own conscience individually, do you 
pray or do you content yourself 
with saying your prayers ? There is 
a vital difference between the two 
processes. Many of us are taught 
to say prayers and have not learned 
how to pray. What inconsistency 
is there, what glaring inconsistency, 
in the man who kneels and says: 
"Our Father, which art in heaven," 
and then proclaims that he is the 
offspring of the brute and not the 
child of God; that God is no per- 
sonage but an influence, an essence, 
an immaterial nothing— there can't 
be an immaterial something — and 
then address that conception of his 
as "Father." Oh, what sacrilege in 
the man who is profane of heart 
and who drags the name of God in 
the mire of his foul, blasphemous 
oath, and then says, "Hallowed be 
Thy name !" What of us who pray, 
"Thy kingdom come," and then, 
through the operation of political 
machinery and through our partisan 
plans and designs, seek to establish 
and to maintain power whose chief 
purpose is that of oppression and 



denial of the rights that were vindi- 
cated in the great battle of Michael 
and his hosts against Satan and his 
followers. 

"Thy will be done on earth as it 
is in heaven," say some, and then 
they go out to thwart the will of 
God and to hinder His purposes 
and to put obstacles in the way of 
progress. 

"Give us this day our daily 
bread," is said as a prayer, but can- 
not be truly prayed by the man who 
is storing up for his own distant fu- 
ture by taking the bread out of the 
mouths of the present hungry. We 
are not taught to pray, Give me my 
daily bread only, but, Give us, all 
Thv children, the sustenance that 
we require. 

"And forgive us our debts as we 
forgive our debtors," or "Forgive 
us our trespasses as we forgive 
them who trespass against us," and 
rise from our knees, as some do, to 
go out to seize a brother by the 
neck and say, "Pay me that which 
thou owest ; I demand it." The un- 
forgiving soul who thus prays con- 
victs himself of hypocrisy and of 
sacrilege. 

"Lead us not into temptation," or 
as some render it, "Leave us not in 
temptation," and then go as fast as 
we can into the very place where 
we know temptation is strongest ; 
we want to be tempted. 

"Deliver us from evil," when we 
love the haunts of evil more than 
the abode of righteousness. 

"For Thine is the kingdom," 
when we deny our Lord any and all 
influence or participation in the af- 
fairs of these earthly kingdoms and 
principalities and powers which man 
has established, and ascribe to Him 
the- glory when we are taking all 
the credit to ourselves, and seal the

whole with a great Amen, which is 
but a blasphemy. 

I am afraid you will think I am 
making a severe arraignment. I 
want to assure you, my brethren 
and sisters, I don't apply these re- 
marks to any one of you, not one — 
unless you think I do. I don't mean 
any man who honestly, soberly, sin- 
cerely does not feel that these re- 
marks are applicable to him. 

The infinite foreknowledge of 
God has made known to Him and 
does make known to Him the end 
from the beginning; but there are 
some of us so short-sighted, so weak 
of mind, so unfitted or unwilling to 
analyze the proposition, that we 
have come to hold and to teach that 
the foreknowledge of God deter- 
mines what shall take place. How 
absurd is such an inference, how 
utterly unwarranted is such a con- 
clusion, that because God in His 
wisdom sees and knows ahead what 
will take place among nations and 
men, under given conditions, which 
conditions He can also foresee, that 
knowledge of His determines that 
such things should be. Let us make 
a concrete example : The college 
professor instructs his students, ex- 
plains to them, demonstrates to 
them by blackboard and chart, and 
perhaps by apparatus upon the ta- 
ble, makes plain to them the opera- 
tion of the laws that are under con- 
sideration and study ; not only that, 
he will help individually the student 
who' reaches after him, who comes 
to him in the proper spirit and asks 
for help ; and that teacher foresees 
the outcome. After he has studied 
his students well, he says, "I know 
that that young man is going to 
fail ; I know that disappointment 
will come to him ; sorrow will come 
to his parents ; I am positive that he 
is going to do himself discredit." 



The teacher foresees it and does all 
that he reasonably and consistently 
can to avert it. Do you dare af- 
firm that that teacher's foresight de- 
termines that student's failure ? On 
the other hand he sees one who is 
devoted, earnest, and able, and he 
says, "That young man will grow 
to be a master in his chosen profes- 
sion ; he is leaving nothing undone 
that ought to be done ; he is not 
studying pages, but subjects; I can 
foresee for him a great future." 
Does that foresight determine the 
young man's success? Or consider 
the case of an earnest, thoughtful 
and loving father in mortality who 
watches with great concern the er- 
ring ways, let us say, for the pur- 
pose of example, of a wayward son. 
He warns him, he prays with him, 
he ministers unto him, he sets him a 
good example and yet he can see, 
though the vision of the future is 
a cloud of sorrow upon his soul, 
that this young man is going to de- 
struction ; aye, he can see the prison 
doors opening for him, and shud- 
ders at the thought of what is im- 
minent in that young boy's life. 
That father would give anything he 
possesses to avert what he sees com- 
ing. Can we be consistent in saying 
that because he has thus studied his 
son, learne'd his nature, and thus 
knows what is approaching, that his 
knowledge determines that that son 
shall sin? Were that so, it would 
be better that we teach parents not 
to study their children, not to know 
anything about them — let them go 
their way and take their course, be- 
cause our knowledge will determine 
what they shall do and be. If I 
examine the barometer, the hy- 
grometer and other instruments of 
precision that have been constructed 
for the purpose of revealing atmos- 
pheric conditions, and if by the ap-

plication of the laws of meteorology 
I am able to say, "there will be a 
rain within a few hours; a great 
windstorm will break upon us soon ; 
we shall have snow before morn- 
ing;" can you say that I cause the 
rain, that I summon the wind, or 
that I am the giver of the snow ? If 
this be true, ignorance is not only 
bliss, but much to be preferred, for 
practical reasons. God's foreknowl- 
edge showed Him exactly what our 
first parents would do under given 
conditions, but He did not cause 
them to fall ; He did not cause them 
to disobey; He gave them their 
freedom and their agency to do as 
they chose to do and take the con- 
sequences of their choice. Let us be 
men and be willing to take the 
blame for our evil acts, if we have 
chosen the evil. 

In the same way many of us 
blame Satan for a great deal for 
which he is not responsible— poor 
devil. If Satan and his hosts were 
bound today and no longer able to 
work personally upon the earth, evil 
would go on for a long time, be- 
cause he has very able representa- 
tives in the flesh. When I traveled 
in distant Russia, years ago, I 
learned of a peculiar conception 
among the moujiks, or peasants, m 
that land. They say that there is a 
household sprite, an unseen little 
imp that dwells in every house and 
that is always trying to cause trou- 
ble ; and if a girl, through careless- 
ness drops a dish and breaks it, the 
mother shakes her head and says, 
"That was the sprite." If the man 
forgets himself and gets drunk, and 
in his drunkenness wreaks barbar- 
ity they say, " Ah, poor fellow ; he 
is under the influence of the sprite ; 
he could not help it;" and so for 
every little detail of life they find an 
excuse and blame that little unseen 



imp for their own acts of evil or 
carelessness. 

This is a practical religion of 
ours, my brethren, a very real re- 
ligion. There is nothing of the fan- 
ciful and theoretical about it. Let 
us learn to analyze our own souls 
and see to it that we are striving to 
work righteousness. A remark that 
is credited to the great Lincoln, and 
one which, whether made by him or 
not, is wholly worthy of the man, is 
perhaps profitable for consideration 
here. When asked, during the great 
conflict in which brother was ar- 
rayed against brother, whether he 
felt in his heart that the Lord was 
on his side, he answered, "I don't 
know, and as a matter of fact, that 
does not concern me; what I want 
to know is, am I on the Lord's 
side?" It is a great deal better for 
us, a far loftier conception, I take it, 
to consider that we are on God's 
side than to worry ourselves as to 
whether He is on our side. In your 
dealings, my brother, in your bar- 
ter and your trade, be on the Lord's 
side ; do as He would have you do 
under those conditions. As a people 
we profess to be on the Lord's side. 
It is for us to make good that pro- 
fession, to live up to it, to avail our- 
selves of the influences that are at 
work for our good, and the powers 
that are operating for the salvation 
of men. Remember that this help is 
extended by the Lord in all reason 
— not capriciously and not when it 
is undeserved and unappreciated; 
for thus He declared Himself, as 
you will find recorded in the first 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants : 

"For I, the Lord, cannot look up- 
on sin with the least degree of al- 
lowance. Nevertheless he that re- 
pents and does the commandments 
of the Lord shall be forgiven ; and

he that repents not, from him shall 
be taken away even the light which 
he hath received ; for my spirit shall 
not always strive with man, saith 
the Lord of hosts." I pray that we 
may not forfeit the influences of 
that Spirit, but that we may be open 
to its influences, be guided by its 
power and eventually come back 
into the presence of the Father, and 
the Mother, who are waiting to wel- 
come their children on their return 
from this earth school in which we 
are now pupils and students. God 
grant it in the name of the Master, 
Amen.

PREST. SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I am very much honored, this 
morning, in the privilege of stand- 
ing before you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, for a few minutes, to occupy 
your valuable time, and I desire that 
you will, give me the benefit of your 
faith and prayers while I am thus 
engaged. 

It is written in the scriptures that 
angels were heard singing "Glory 
to God on high, peace on earth, and 
good will to men." It was about the 
hour of the birth of the Child of 
Promise, that was to be the Savior 
of the world, who was to introduce 
conditions that would lead to the 
salvation of the human family. The 
subject of the redemption of man- 
kind was about to be introduced, the 
set time had come. We have an ac ■ 
count of a prophecy uttered on this 
continent, by Samuel, the Lamanite, 
who stated to those with whom he 
associated, a small number of peo- 
ple who accepted the teachings of 



the Gospel truths of the Nephite 
prophets, that there would come a 
time when a sign would be given, 
and this sign should be a prophetic 
evidence of the coming of the Lord. 
This sign was, there would be no 
darkness between two days, there 
would be a day, and a night, 
and a day when there would 
be no darkness. The enemies of 
the members of the little church 
forbade the people who belonged 
thereto uttering this prophecy, or 
expressing their belief in its fulfil- 
ment, and finally threatened that if 
they again uttered their belief, in 
this saored prediction that death 
should be the penalty and destruc- 
tion would come upon the Church. 
The Nephite prophet, as recorded 
in III Nephi, sought a secret place 
and knelt in prayer to God to learn 
if He might look for the fulfillment 
of that prophecy, and the deliver- 
ance of his people. The Lord Him- 
self spoke unto him in an audible 
voice and said, "Lift up your head 
and be of good cheer, for behold, 
the time is at hand, and on this night 
shall the sign be given, and on the 
morrow come I into the world." 
The history records that on that 
very night as the sun went down, 
there was no darkness, the light was 
bright and did not fade away, and 
the prediction was fulfilled, to the 
discomforture of the enemies of the 
Church, and to the joy of those who 
believed in the fulfillment. 

Far away, across the ocean, in 
the land of Palestine, in the town 
of Bethlehem, the child Jesus was 
born, and wise men, we are told, 
came to do homage unto Him. They 
had followed a star that had beck- 
oned them, or inspired them we 
might have said, to follow; it cer- 
tainly was an inspiration to them. 
When these wise men had come to 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jerusalem, they, visited King Herod, 
and asked him where the child was 
born that was to be king of the 
Jews. Herod was very much ex- 
cited, no doubt, because of the 
question, but he could not answer 
it, and he appealed to the Jewish 
Sanhedrin and they answered him 
that the child should be born in the 
city of David or Bethlehem, as it 
was called, and the wise men con- 
tinued their journey until they came 
to where the star stood over the 
place where the young child lay. 
Herod had said unto them, Return 
to me when you have found the 
new born child and bring me word 
that I too may come and worship 
him. But we find here an inter- 
position of the Spirit of the Lord, 
for an angel who guarded the 
young child and its welfare, whis- 
pered unto the wise men, Go not 
back by the way of Herod : he seeks 
the young child's life. So the wise 
men went their way back to their 
homes in another direction, and did 
not call at Herod's palace. The 
record says, when Herod found 
that the wise men had mocked him, 
or deceived him, he was very much 
enraged, and he issued an edict that 
every child in Bethlehem and vicin- 
ity, from two years old and under, 
every male child, should be put to 
death. To escape this violence, or 
this threatened death, the angel of 
the. Lord warned Joseph and Mary 
to take the young child and flee into 
Egypt. The purposes of the Eter- 
nal" Father were not to be thwarted, 
were not to be prevented of their 
fulfillment bv any act of a wicked 
king. It had been decreed that the 
coining forth at the appointed time 
of this precious child should be for 
the redemption of the human fam- 
ily, for the salvation of our Father's 
children. 



We read that when Jesus began 
His ministry, the first act recorded 
of Him was His coming to John. 
John, his fore-runner, we are told r 
had been baptizing in Jordan, and 
Jesus came to him and asked, or 
demanded baptism. John said, "L 
have need to be baptized of Thee,, 
and comest Thou to me?" But 
Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now." 
And then he suffered Him ; and 
when He came up out of the water 
John saw the Holy Ghost "descend- 
ing like a dove, and lighting upon 
Him," and a voice from on high 
was heard to exclaim, "This is My 
beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased." 

In the day in which we live, we 
have a history of a boy, a farmer's 
boy, one who was not versed in the 
religious doctrines of the Christian 
churches, one who had never been 
ordained a minister, according to 
the manner of their ordinations, one 
who had not been chosen by them, 
and if his name had been mentioned 
anywhere in their churches for ad- 
vancement, or for ordination, he 
would probably not have been ac- 
cepted. He was fourteen and a 
half years of age, without educa- 
tion, but there was a power and 
presence on high that was watching 
over this boy, and was ready to 
answer his prayers. When he re- 
tired into a secret place, within the 
confines of a shady grove, he bowed 
himself before the Lord and humbly 
inquired in fervent prayer, how he 
could obtain knowledge and wis- 
dom from his heavenly Father. It 
appears that while he was earnest, 
and his desires true and faithful to 
learn and to understand, there was 
an evil power watching and follow- 
ing him, and that power seized upon 
him and choked his utterance, and 
had such effect upon him that he de- 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



107 



clares that he was unable to audibly 
utter his prayer, and continue his 
supplications, but he said, "I lifted 
my heart to God, I prayed earnestly 
in the silence of my soul, and very 
soon I saw a bright light shining 
upon the leaves of the trees above 
my head, and it was so bright I 
thought at first that the leaves of 
the forest were on fire, and yet 
though the light was so vivid, it did 
not consume the trees nor the fol- 
iage." Soon that light settled down 
upon the youthful supplicant and 
filled his soul, filled his being, every 
fiber thereof with its effugence, and 
as soon as this occurred the evil 
power fled and left him free to the 
enjoyment of the Holy Spirit that 
was sent down from God, even the 
Holy Ghost. 

President Smith informs me that 
my time is about up. I will close 
by saying that Joseph Smith, the 
occupant of that sacred grove, was 
ministered to by the power of God, 
and thus prepared by the minis- 
tration of the Holy Spirit to re- 
ceive the presence of the Father and 
the Son and to be commissioned by 
Them to do a great work for the 
redemption of our Father's chil- 
dren. The Prophet Joseph main- 
tained his position as a chosen ser- 
vant of God from that time through 
all the days of persecution and trials 
that he was called to pass, until the 
day of his martyrdom, sealing his 
testimony with his blood. I know 
that he was a prophet of God, and 
he fulfilled the measure of his crea- 
tion, and the destiny that God had 
assigned unto him. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 
The word of the Lord to Moses : 
"But only an account of this earth, 
and the inhabitants thereof, give I 



unto you. For behold, there are many 
worlds that have passed away by the 
word o f my power. And there are 
many that now stand, and innumerable 
are they unto man, but all things are 
numbered unto me, for they are mine 
and I know them. 

"And it came to pass that Moses 
spake unto the Lord, saying: Be mer- 
ciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell 
me concerning this earth, and the in- 
habitants thereof, and also the heav- 
ens, and thy servant will be content. 

"And the Lord God spake unto 
Moses, saying: The heavens they are 
many, and they cannot be numbered 
unto man; but they are numbered unto 
me, for they are mine. 

"And as one earth shall pass awav. 
and the heavens thereof, even so shall 
another come; and there is .no end to 
my works, neither to my words." 

I read this passage of scripture 
because there is in it the representa- 
tion of a great program of the cre- 
ations of God, the integration of 
worlds and the disintegration of 
worlds, and it presents on a grander 
scale than any other scripture that 
I am acquainted with, the great gov- 
erning and controlling power of 
God, both in the integration or cre- 
ation of things, and also in the dis- 
integration of things ; but whether 
worlds are being formed from 
chaos and brought into orderly sys- 
tems, or whether systems them- 
selves be disintegrated, it affords 
me unspeakable pleasure and confi- 
dence in the stability and in the . 
preservation of orderly creations, 
that God presides over all. I be- 
lieve, too, from the manifestation of 
God's wisdom that wherever disin- 
tegration is going on, where de- 
struction apparently takes place, it 
will only be for the purpose of mak- 
ing room for more excellent things ; 
and so this scripture ministers to me 
very comforting thoughts, and 
though I sometimes read in the 
works of men who give attention to 



103 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the extent and greatness of the uni- 
verse, and the laws that govern 
therein, so far as they can under- 
stand them, that they, too, as well 
as this inspired man, become ac- 
quainted with the fact that here and 
there in spots throughout God's uni- 
verse, disintegrating forces are go- 
ing on and worlds are sometimes 
blotted out — yet the cosmos is pre- 
served and order prevails instead 
of chaos. 

That is rather a lofty conception 
of things that God gives us then of 
His masterfulness in the midst of 
His creations, and now I am a lit- 
tle sorry to draw your minds out of 
this great conception of things to 
make application of that principle in 
our earthly affairs, and yet I must 
do it if I would teach the lesson I 
have in mind. 

Several times in this conference, 
when the fear came to me that I 
might be called upon to occupy this 
position for a few minutes, the 
thought came to me several times, if 
that happens I will not speak a word 
in relation to the great war now go- 
ing on in Europe ; so much has been 
said, and well said, that there is no 
need for me to say a word upon that 
subject, and anyhow I am a man of 
peace. I love peace and I pursue it. 
If you will pardon the personal note 
of it for just one moment, I may 
say to you that I really never had, 
in my boyhood days, a fight in my 
life but what it was forced on me. 
(Laughter.) Personally I was just 
in the same condition that the na- 
tions of Europe are now in, I was 
forced to fight ; and generally, in fact 
so far as I can remember always, I 
entered every engagement that fell 
in my way with a good deal of anx- 
iety, even fear, but there was this 
peculiarity about it — I don't know 
that it is peculiar, however; per- 



haps it is a common inheritance to 
all men — but' the first blow struck, 
I was always very comfortable after 
that. (Laughter.) But I believe 
in peace, and most heartily have T 
joined in the prayer for peace for 
those distracted nations now en- 
gaged in the dreadful arbitrament 
of their differences in war. This 
principle that is here described in 
regard to God's control of disinte- 
grating forces in the universe as 
well as integrating forces, leads me 
to feel, in spite of all the horror of 
this great modern war, that God 
will control it just as He controls 
the wrath of men, which He makes 
to praise Him, and the rest of man's 
wrath He restrains. So my confi- 
dence is that the dreadful forces of 
war will not go beyond those limits 
that are necessary to bring to pass 
the purposes of the Almighty; and 
while I join in sorrow for those who 
will be brought to misery and pov- 
erty and death in this awful war, I 
nevertheless cannot help but believe 
that as God causes worlds and sys- 
tems of worlds to pass away, that 
have doubtless reached the climax 
of their possibilities in their present 
form, and hence He destroys those 
forms so that there shall be better 
ones created, so now in this awful 
struggle I believe that it will finally 
end in the higher planes of civiliza- 
tion being reached, rather than that 
the present glories of our civiliza- 
tion shall pass away. 

I say I join with you in the splen- 
did services we have held in this 
conference in praying for peace, but 
deeper than that prayer for peace, 
more earnestly than for that prayer 
of peace, do I pray that justice, na- 
tional justice shall prevail; and I 
hope the present war will not halt 
until justice, as God sees justice, 
shall be established. If it were halted 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



109 



Ijefore that great achievement, the 
hecatombs of the slain up to now, 
the misery that will come in corise- 
quence of the war, will all be in 
vain; and so, though it may seem 
harsh and cruel, yet I sincerely trust 
that now the inevitable war has 
started, it shall go on to the end for 
the establishment of justice, and as 
God presides over the disintegrat- 
ing forces in His universe, yet out 
of that destruction re-creates still 
better, so do I believe that the very 
forces of war are sometimes but in- 
struments in His hand for the ac- 
complishment of His purposes. I 
can conceive nothing of weakness in 
the attributes of Deity, and some of 
the things necessary sometimes to 
make progress are physical forces 
as well as moral and spiritual 
forces, and when used by him, of 
course, they are used in righteous- 
ness, and sometimes God is in the 
battle as well as in the still small 
voice and the wonderful invisible 
spirit that overspreads nations of 
people and changes, their mental 
and moral attitude towards the 
great things that are going on in 
the worFcl; God moves upon the 
minds of the people to bring them 
to the accomplishment of things 
even as He will. In evidence that 
God is sometimes in war, I have in 
an old note here, a statement about 
an occurrence in Israel, to the ef- 
fect that the tribe of Reuben and 
Gad and one-half of the tribe of 
Manasseh were at war with the 
Hagarites, and they were successful 
in their contest, "for there fell down 
many slain ( of the enemy), because 
the war was of God." On another 
occasion when Joshua was taking 
possession of the heritage which 
God had given to Israel, and Israel 
was sore beset by the enemy, sud- 
denly there appeared a magnificent 



warrior clothed cap-a-pie in shining 
armor, and Joshua approached him, 
apparently with some temerity and 
said, "Are you on our side or on 
the side of the enemy?" "No," re- 
plied this personage, "But as cap- 
tain of the Lord's hosts come I 
now." And Joshua fell down be- 
fore the personage and worshiped 
at his feet, without reproach. We 
read that there was war in heaven. 
I think God was in that war, for 
Satan was overthrown and forced 
from heaven. I cannot help but 
think that when the patriot fathers 
who founded our nation drew the 
sword against the great empire of 
England,in the maintenance of their 
avowed rights, and for the establish- 
ment of free government in this 
world, God sustained their feeble 
arms and crowned them with glory, 
though to do it He brought to their 
assistance the old-time monarchies 
of Spain and France, one of the 
most wonderful lessons in history — 
the use by the Lord of these repre- 
sentatives of arbitrary power in the 
old world to establish free institu- 
tions in the new, a remarkable inci- 
dent in the history of men. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I 
feel very comfortable even in the 
midst of these war times, knowing 
that God stands in the background 
of things and that He will have His 
way. 

Speaking now of our own nation, 
just for a moment, and the pride I 
feel in it. I think we have a right to 
be a bit optimistic in relation to our 
own nation, I believe it is fulfilling 
the high destiny that God has 
marked out for it in these modern 
times. He founded it by wise men 
whom He raised up to frame the 
Constitution, which outlines the 
true principles of civil government, 
a law that I feel has gone forth 



110

from Zion to permeate the whole 
world, to break up monarchial insti- 
tutions, to break militarism, and to 
exhibit to the nations that there are 
other forces of government that 
should prevail rather than those pol- 
icies of "blood and iron," in which 
men have so prided themselves. I 
believe our country will fulfill that 
kind of a mission. God not only 
founded this great government by 
the wisdom which He gave to wise 
men, the men upon which He 
caused His inspiration to rest; not 
only did He found it, but He pre- 
served it. He tells us here in one 
of these revelations where He de- 
clares that He founded this govern- 
ment by wise men whom He raised 
up for that purpose, that He sanc- 
tified the land by the shedding of 
blood, and niade it holy to us, be- 
cause we can see what our freedom 
cost in the best blood of the human 
race in our great Revolutionary 
War. And God not only founded 
our nation, but He preserved it in 
one of the most awful conflicts that 
had existed in the world up to that 
time, now, however, rendered well- 
nigh insignificant in comparison 
with the terrible war now raging 
in Europe. The war in Eu- 
rope is on a scale in keeping with 
our modern life, and reveals to us 
the great progress that the world 
has been making, since it would 
have been impossible a hundred 
years ago, when Napoleon Bona- 
parte was fighting over practically 
the same area of country that is 
now strewn with drawn battle lines, 
in France and Belgium, — it would 
have been impossible then, and I say 
this, in a way, is a revelation of the 
greatness of our modern life ; our 
very wars are more stupendous than 
those of former ages. 

Well, I say the Lord has pre- 



served this nation; and it is 
possible for this nation to hold 
to the sacred heritage that God has 
given it. Brother Ivins, in his re- 
marks yesterday, and other brethren 
who have spoken here, have called 
attention to the conditions upon 
which our nation may preserve its 
heritage, and its power in the world, 
and especially in this new world. It 
is remarkable to me that all the mes- 
sages of scripture — or nearly so, 
that pertain to this western hemi- 
sphere — we find those messages, 
those warnings, those conditions up- 
on which the safety of our national 
life depends, are in this record, the 
Book of Mormon. I say it is re- 
markable to me, and yet it is not so 
upon second thought, because that 
is where you would naturally look 
for them; but perhaps the idea la- 
boring in my mind is the importance 
of this American record revealed 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
the things that are found in it con- 
cerning our America. To those 
splendid passages read by Brother 
Ivins here yesterday, I want to add 
one more, because it constitutes a 
message which the Latter-day 
Saints must deliver to this nation, 
we must make it known ; and conse- 
quently in this official conference of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, where what is said has 
something of an official character to 
it; where we speak, in a way, with 
collective voice, I am taking' the lib- 
erty of reading this scripture. They, 
are the words of Moroni, when he 
was translating the records of Ether 
and giving an account of the colony 
of the brother of Jared coming to 
this land of America, and the cove- 
nants of the Lord upon the land. 
The comments are by Moroni in 
this record of Ether, from which I 
now read : 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



Ill 



"And the Lord would not suffer that 
they Tthe Jaredites] should stop be- 
yond the sea in the wilderness, but he 
would that' they should come forth 
even unto the land of promise, which 
was choice above all other lands, which 
the Lord God had preserved for a 
righteous people; 

"And he had sworn in his wrath 
unto the brother of Jared/that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, 
from that time, henceforth and for- 
ever, should serve him, the true and 
only God, or they should be swept off 
when the fullness of his wrath should 
come upon them. 

"And now we can behold the de- 
crees of God concerning this land, that 
it is a land of promise, and whatsoever 
nation shall possess it, shall serve 
God, or they shall be swept off when 
the fullness of his wrath shall come 
upon them. And the fullness of his 
wrath cometh upon them when they 
are ripened in iniquity; 

"For behold, this is a land which is 
choice above all other lands; where- 
fore, he that doth possess it shall 
serve God, or shall be swept off; for 
it is the everlasting decree of God. 
And it is not until the fullness of in- 
iquity among the children of the land, 
that they are swept off. 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye 
Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees 
of God, that ye may repent, and not con- 
tinue in your iniquities until the fulness 
■come, that ye may not bring down the 
fulness of the wrath of God upon you, as 
the inhabitants of the land have hitherto 
■done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it, 
■shall be free from bondage, and from 
captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ." 

This scripture does not leave the 
Gentile nations in doubt as to whom 
it is that must be worshiped as God. 
He is — 

"The God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, who hath been manifested by 
the things which we have written." 
(Book of Ether,' ch. ii.) 



How valuable to the Gentile na- 
tions and to Israel, too, so far as 
he occupies the land, is this 
knowledge ! What a great message 
is in this revealed American Scrip- 
ture — the very conditions upon 
which the nations who occupy the 
land may hold an inheritance, is here 
written down and proclaimed in this 
great Nephite record. How pre- 
cious it is unto the inhabitants of 
this land! How honored we ought 
to feel that we can, through the 
blessings of the Lord, make procla- 
mation of these conditions and de- 
liver the very word of the Lord 
unto the inhabitants of this land, 
and especially to our own na- 
tion, which exercises the dom- 
inating political 'power in the land 
— that we can give them the 
conditions upon which they may 
perpetuate their inheritance and 
their power. And I say, notwith- 
standing a terrible arraignment 
might be made of the wickedness 
and of the corruption that is in our 
own nation, yet I believe the people 
en masse are yet sound, and have 
enough of virtue to build upon, and 
which may be caused to grow in 
strength and in volume until the fa- 
vor of the Lord may be perpetuated 
upon our nation. 

I think it is a good omen, a splen- 
did omen, that the executive of the 
nation in this hour of the world's 
trial can call all the inhabitants of 
the land to come to the throne of 
God and pray for peace, thus recog- 
nizing God and His influence upon 
the. affairs of men. If we can only 
perpetuate that kind of spirit in the 
land, I believe that having had our 
chastisement as a nation for our na- 
tional sins — including the shedding 
of the blood of our prophets— hav- 
ing had our chastisement in the ter-

rible Civil War that swept the land, 
that filled it with mourning and sor- 
row for a generation — I hope that 
the correction will be enough, and 
that from now on we shall have 
power to preach- the Gospel in such 
plainness and manifest power of the 
spirit of the Lord, that we shall 
keep the nation in the favor of the 
Lord, and go on from righteousness 
to righteousness, from peace to 
peace, until we shall develop more 
completely than we have yet devel- 
oped those great underlying princi- 
pes of civil government that God 
gave to our nation, and that finally 
will become the inheritance of the 
world — God's law that shall go 
forth from Zion. I pray so, in the 
name of Jesus, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing; 

Fill our hearts with joy and peace; 
Let us each, Thy love possessing, 

Triumph in redeeming grace. 

Elder John L. Herrick pronounced 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 
President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

The invocation was offered by 
Elder Samuel E. Woolley. 



The congregation sang the hymn : 

O, say, what is Truth? 'Tis ihe fairest 

gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce ; 

And priceless the value of truth will be, 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is- counted but dross and refuse. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

The short time that I occupy I 
very much desire to have the Spirit 
of the Lord. I think possibly it 
would not be amiss if I occupied the 
time in talking about the Seven- 
ties. I claim to be good authority 
on that subject, and the information 
that I shall use comes from the Pre- 
siding Bishop's office, and they will 
vouch for its accuracy. 

My object and purpose in speak- 
ing of the Seventies is to enlighten 
the Church as to that great body 
of Priesthood, who have a special 
calling as witness of the Lord to the 
nations of the earth. They are 
preachers of righteousness and our 
great effort has been not only to 
keep up with the organization, but 
where it has been deenued wise, the 
quorums have been increased in or- 
der to get the benefit that comes out 
of the class work. For we find where 
quorums are scattered throughout 
a stake, one quorum in a stake 
or one quorum in five or six or eight 
wards, it is very difficult to hold 
class mettings. It is understood 
that in all such cases that they hold 
a general Seventies' meeting, once 
each month. Last Sunday, at four 
p. m., we called a special conference 
of the Seventies, and we were very 
happy in finding four hundred and 
four Seventies in that gathering in 
the Bishop's building. By a show, 
of hands, I think we could safely 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL.

say, that eighty-five per cent of that 
number were presidents of Seven- 
ties. We had a program which 
was well handled, taking up Quor- 
um Administrative Questions. This 
body of Priesthood, to give you an 
idea of the greatness of the num- 
ber, there are enough Seventies in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints to fill this great 
building to overflowing. 

The activities of Seventies as 
compiled from the stake and ward 
reports for the year, 1913, are as 
follows : 



Total number of Seventies in 

the Church 10,968 

Total number enrolled in Quor- 
ums as reported for the year 
1913 8,078 

Total number enrolled in Sev- 
enties Class 9,190 

Total number of Seventies not 

enrolled in Quroums 2,890 

Total number of Seventies not 
performing any duties in 
Stakes or wards 2,145 

Total number who did not at- 
tend a Quorum meeting dur- 
year 1913 1,308 

Seventies who are acting as 
Presidents of Seventies and 
Instructors of Quorums.... 1,782 

Seventies who are performing 

Stake duties 704 

Seventies who are performing 
Ward duties 6,933 

Seventies who are acting as of- 
ficers and instructors in Aux- 
iliary organiations 3,778 



We learn from this report that 
the total number of appointments 
filled by Seventies in the Church 
is 13,197. If we are correct in our 
analysis of the above report, the 
First Council is held responsible for 
2,145 Seventies who are not per- 
forming any duties in the stakes or 
wards, and still we find that there 
are 2,890 Seventies not enrolled in 
any quroums of Seventy, and it is 
just possibe that they are not mem- 



bers of any ward, but are wander- 
ing to and fro throughout the 
Church. They are, no doubt, good 
men in their way, but must be 
"billy-goats," and not sheep, but 
they should belong to the sheep 
fold. 

This report gives information as 
to the activities of Seventies at 
home and abroad, and gives proof 
that 95 8-10 per cent of this body 
of Priesthood are giving good home 
service, and performing mission- 
ary work, under the direction of 
the local authorities. The report 
does not give the condition of Sev- 
enties financially, nor does it at- 
tempt to speak of their struggles, 
failures and poverty, and that death 
sometimes finds its way into their 
homes. Neither does it give the 
information that many of these 
Seventies have sons who are on 
missions, and the fathers are de- 
fraying their expenses. It is not 
understood that the standard and 
spiritual measurement of the men 
is to be found in the report. This 
report does not attempt to tell of the 
visits of representatives of the First 
Council, but it merely shows the 
activities of Seventies at home. If 
it be true that 25 per cent of 8,078 
Seventies who are enrolled in quor- 
ums are not performing any duties 
in stakes or wards, it leaves 75 per 
cent of the total number enrolled 
who are actively engaged in home 
and foreign service. 

We desire, that you may know, 
that notwithstanding that 2,890 
Seventies are wanderers that we are 
trying to overcome this difficulty. 
Quorums of Seventies are instruc- 
ted to receive all Seventies who 
come in their quorum district, who 
are received by the Bishops in the 
wards, and to receive them without 
recommendation, without trans- 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fers, as their transfers can be se- 
cured afterwards. It must be un- 
derstood by the Priesthood of God, 
in this Church, that there can be no 
such thing as resigning from a 
quorum of Priesthood in the 
Church. When you have made 
covenant with God and the Church 
and received the Priesthood you 
cannot resign. The only way to 
get out of a quorum of Priesthood 
is to commit sin, and get disfellow- 
shiped from the Church. As long 
as you hold that Priesthood we have 
the right to receive you into the 
quorums and it is the duty of those 
who preside to labor with those who 
are careless and indifferent. Breth- 
ren and sisters, we want to show 
you, what this great body of Priest- 
hood are doing in home service. In 
1913, there was only three hundred 
forty-six Seventies on missions in 
the word preaching the Gospel, but 
we have been training and educating 
and directing this body of Priest- 
hood to labor faithfully and de- 
votedly under the direction of the 
local authorities. 

Now, brethren, with a good deal 
of pride, I challenge you High 
Priests and you Eders, and the les- 
ser Priesthood, to make a better 
showing. We grant you that our 
quorums are made up of young men 
and older men of great experience, 
men who have filled missions, many 
of them, and they are devoted to the 
Church. That has been the line of 
our work in the past few years. 
' The Lord has truly blessed us in 
the labor, with the assistance that we 
have received and the sustaining 
support that we have had from the 
brethren of the authorities, the 
Counsel of the Twelve, the presi- 
dents of stakes and the Bishop of 
wards. If we are correct: take the 
two thousand one hundred and 



forty-five Seventies who are not 
taking any part in Church duties, 
and the two thousand eight hun- 
dred ninety "billy-goats," that are 
wandering throughout the Church, 
that belong to no quorums and are 
scattered all over the land, there is 
a great missionary work to be done 
by the presidents of Seventies ; as 
there are five thousand Seventies in 
the Church of Christ that need la- 
boring with by preaching the Gos- 
pel to them, because of their care- 
lessness and indifference. 

In conclusion : I don't know 
when. I have been more delighted 
for a long time, than when I heard 
President Francis M. Lyman, the 
president of the Twelve Apostles, 
say to the presidents of stakes and 
the bishops of wards, "When you 
want missionaries, you are to go 
to the Seventies instead of any 
others. As you need them in the 
missionary field to go with our 
boys." We have ample proof, ample 
evidence that we need men of ex- 
perience to go with our young men, 
until they get under training. 

As to missionary work at home : 
I need not go but a short distance 
from here as I happen to have in 
mind an illustration. We can go to 
the Jordan stake, as I remember it, 
they have nine thousand members 
of the Church ; in that one stake 
alone there are over nine thousand 
persons who are non-members ot 
the Church. A great missionary 
work can be done under the direc- 
tion of the local authorities, the 
presidents of stakes, and the bishops 
of wards, in setting apart these Sev- 
enties, instructing them, enthusing 
them, awakening them until they 
love the souls of the children of men 
and are willing to give good service 
in preaching the Gospel. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

I hope it goes without saying; that 
I have unfaltering, unwavering 
faith in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints — it is the great 
thing in my life. If I fail in this 
one object — salvation — I have failed 
in everything.- I sustain the au- 
thorities of the Church ; I sustain 
President Joseph F. Smith and the 
Council of the Twelve. I have an 
abiding faith in Joseph Smith as a 
prophet of God. I believe all that 
has been revealed unto this people, 
whether I can live it or not ; I be- 
lieve it all ; I swallow every bit of 
it, I don't sugar-coat it, either. 
Brethren, I am willing to place all 
that I have and am upon the altar. 
It does not amount to very much, 
but you are welcome to every bit 
of it. The Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I too, am a man of peace. I be- 
lieve in peace and love to walk in 
the paths of peace. If there is any- 
thing that is contrary to my na- 
ture, it is to be in the midst of strife. 
I desire peace in my home, peace in 
my country, peace in my own soul. 
But notwithstanding my native love 
for peace I find myself continually 
involved in war, in what may be 
termed a universal war. Across the 
waters a great war is being waged in 
which many nations are engaged ; in 
this struggle, to which I allude all 
nations are involved, indeed, every 
human being has a part. 

It is the war again sin, against 
weakness and imperfection. It is 
God's battle for the right against the 
powers of evil which are everywhere 
arrayed against Him. It is a san- 
guinary war. Many there be who 
fall upon this battlefied, and when 



they thus die they are dead indeed, 
and well may those who love them 
shed tears of sorrow. Some are 
only slightly wounded and others 
are wounded mortally. The Lord 
has provided His Red Cross Society 
— the ministry of His Church, and 
supplied it with a healing balm—-, 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and it 
should be applied to all alike for all 
have been wounded and need his 
healing balm. None have escaped 
the darts of the adversary but all 
may be healed by the application of 
this remedy — even the dead may be 
brought to life again. 

Then let us fight on for the cause 
of truth ; let us labor for the salva- 
tion of human souls, thai all may be 
delivered from this enemy, the arch 
enemy of God, the adversary of the 
souls of the children of men. Let 
us march on under the capacity of 
our Redeemer; let us march under 
His banner, on to victory, for event- 
ually victory will be perched upon 
His banner, and every foe shall be 
overcome. This is a battle to the 
bitter end ; this is a battle that 
means the utter rout of the enemy. 

My brethren and sisters, you and 
I are engaged in this struggle ; we 
are fighting under the banner of 
Christ ; we are endeavoring to bring 
comfort and relief to those that are 
wounded and to those that have fal- 
len upon the battlefield. Let us, be 
untiring in our efforts, then, to save 
the souls of our fellow men, of our 
brethren and sisters throughout the 
world, until peace be restored and 
established in all the world. Let us 
draw night unto the Lord that we 
may have power and strength; for 
the sword of truth is the weapon 
with which we fight : it is a two- 
edged sword that cuts in both direc- 
tions ; let us learn how to wield it, 
and let none lay down his arms, but 



116

let us fig-lit valiantly on until we 
have achieved a glorious victory. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

It is quite an experience, my 
brethren and sisters, to sit here in 
the stand hour after hour for three 
days, in more or less fear all the 
time because of the thought that the 
time is approaching to be called 
upon to occupy this very important 
position as spokesman. It is always 
a very great relief when the duty 
has been performed, and one is per- 
mitted again to take his seat. Some 
of the brethren have been extending 
to members of the First Council 
what I think I may call mock sym- 
pathy, it has been given good- 
naturedly, the brethren indicating by 
their word- that we had awaiting us 
the performance of a duty which 
they had no need to worry about, 
as their part had been accomplished. 
While it is a considerable trial and 
anxiety to undertake to stand be- 
fore a great congregation of this 
character, there is nevertheless con- 
nected with it a goodly degree of 
pleasure, also; the pleasure comes 
from an understanding that the 
work that is being advocated is the 
work of the Lord, and that the testi- 
mony that is to be delivered is to 
be in favor of the cause that our 
Father is seeking to establish among 
men. It is the teaching of the Lord, 
Jesus Christ, that those who hear 
His words and do them shall be lik- 
ened unto men who have digged 
down deep and laid a foundation 
upon bedrock, with such foundation 
the winds may blow and the rains 
descend and beat upon the binding, 
and it will not fall because it is 



founded in a substantial manner. I 
hope, my brethren and sisters, that 
there is a disposition on the part of 
all the people to receive and put 
into practice the counsels that have 
been given by the presiding author- 
ities of the Church in the meetings 
of this Conference. 

During recent months the breth- 
ren who have visited the various 
stakes of Zion have been engaged 
in looking after auxiliary work in 
addition to the regular work that de- 
mands attention at stake conference, 
time. For the past two months, the 
Mutual Improvement Associations 
and the Religion Class organizations 
have been featured at stake con- 
ferences. I feel impressed this after- 
noon to say a few words in regard 
to the latter organization. It seems 
to be the organization that has the 
most difficult pathway to travel at 
the present time. Other church or- 
ganizations have had a longer exist- 
ence. They have apparently in 
many instances found a more com- 
plete lodgment in the hearts of the 
people. It is still said in some lo- 
calities that the support that should 
be given to the Religion class or- 
ganization is not altogether given. 
I hope this is a mistake. The Re- 
ligion class organization has a right- 
eous claim upon all Church officers 
for support, as it has come into the 
Church by proper appointment. 
Twenty-four years ago this month 
a very strong letter was sent out by 
the First Presidency of the Church 
to the stake presidents and to the 
bishops of the various wards, call- 
ing upon them to seek out in the 
wards brethren and sisters who 
gave evidence of ability in the 
teaching of the young, and who had 
love for the young people, to take 
up this important labor. They were 
to be called as upon a mission and 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRlN. 



instructed to give attention to this 
new organization. That letter in- 
dicated that the Presidency of the 
Church had a feeling that the very 
best of material was necessary for 
the accomplishment of the work 
they had in mind. The fact that 
careful selection for the work oft 
times was not made was in my 
mind when I quoted the scripture 
that, "Whosoever heareth these 
sayings of mine and doeth them, I 
will liken him unto a wise man, 
which built his house upon a rock." 
I am convinced, my brethren and 
sisters that if the counsel imparted 
by the presidency of the Church 
twenty-four years ago had been re- 
ceived by local presiding men in 
the spirit of the communication 
then sent out, and earnest efforts 
bad been made to find men and wo- 
men of proper spirit and capacity, 
and they had been taught the im- 
portance and necessity of establish- 
ing the work as suggested and rec- 
ommended by this high authority, 
there would not have been as many 
questionings in the minds of peo- 
ple in relation to this the infant or- 
ganization in the Church of Christ. 

In the letter on religion class 
work, 24 years ago the First Presi- 
dency declare that many of the peo- 
ple had, through the toil of making 
a living, lost sight of the purpose 
that had brought them to this land, 
and had given way in many in- 
stances to less noble aims ; they then 



"This benumbing influence on our 
spiritual life is widely felt in our 
homes, and more particularly affects 
our children, whose faith in the great 
latter-day work has not been devel- 
oped and strengthened by the experi- 
ence which our elders have had in 
lands beyond the borders of Zion. Nor 
does the training which our youth re- 
ceive in the district schools increase 
their feelings of devotion to God and 



love for this cause, for, as is well 
known, all teachings of a religious 
character are rigorously excluded from 
the studies permitted in these institu- 
tions. 

"To lessen this great evil, and coun- 
teract the tendencies that grow out 
of a Godless education, the Church 
Schools of the Saints have been estab- 
lished. But while these accomplish 
great good, the sphere of their useful- 
ness does not cover the entire field. 
There are many places where the 
Church Schools cannot, at present, be 
established; and also many Saints in 
those places where such schools ex 
ist, who, for various reasons, cannot 
send their children thereto. For these 
causes we have deemed it prudent to 
suggest to the various local authori- 
ties other measures which, while not 
occupying the place of the Church 
Schools, will work on the same lines, 
and aid in the same work in which 
the Church educational institutions 
are engaged. 

'We suggest that in every ward 
where a Church School is not estab- 
lished, that some brother or sister, or 
brethren or sisters, well adapted to 
such a responsible position by their 
intelligence and devotion as well as 
their love for the young, be called, 
as on a mission, by the Bishop, after 
consultation with the president of the 
stake, to take charge of a school in 
which the first principles of the Gos- 
pel, Church history, and kindred sub- 
jects shall be taught." 

I have been pleased and interest- 
ed just recently in discovering _ in 
various periodicals a strong spirit 
in harmony with these instructions 
of the Presiding Authorities. 
Thoughtful men in other religious 
denominations, have discovered that 
there is great need for the children 
of school age to receive a training 
similar to the instruction provided 
for the Religion Class organiza- 
tion. In the Literary Digest of June 
13, we read the following: 

"What looks like the beginning of 
the end of the Godlessness of the pub- 
lic schools was pointed out recentlv 
by the Reverend Doctor Wilbur F. 
Crafts. Their Godless character is 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



what the Catholics criticize and the 
parochial schools exist to supply this 
lack. As superintendent of the Inter- 
national Reform Bureau, Doctor 
Crafts has been conferring, by corre- 
spondence and otherwise, with Cath- 
olics, Jews, and Protestants in all 
parts of the world. Doctor Crafts 
also forms one of a committee ap- 
pointed by the educational boards of 
the great evangelical churches, repre- 
senting nineteen million members, 
which has had conferences with com- 
mittees appointed by the Federal 
Council of Churches and the Young 
Men's Christian Association, and has 
kept in touch with the National Re- 
form Association, the pioneer of the 
movement. 

"Doctor Crafts recently told a New 
York Presbyterian preachers' meeting 
of a resolution that may have a large 
place in history. It provided for the 
appointment in behalf of the Presby- 
terian church of a committee to co- 
operate with the committees of other 
Protestant denominations and with 
committees which Jews and Catholics 
will be requested to appoint for the 
purposes of adopting some plan for 
religious training in connection with 
the public schools. 

"It is proposed that this shall be 
done either in the school buildings 
themselves or in the neighboring 
churches, or in both, by which during 
a part of the school time, or at some 
other hour, pastors and teachers of 
the various denominations will teach 
religion to the children of their own 
faith as an essential part of their edu- 
cation, in recognition of the fact that 
thirty minutes of Bible teaching in the 
Sunday Schools is not sufficient, but . 
must be supplemented not only in the 
home and church service, but also in 
the public schools." 

A similar condition and work of 
like character has been taken up, I 
have discovered, in Australia, where 
the very opportunity that the rep- 
resentatives of various religious de- 
nominations here in America are 
seeking to obtain has in Australia 
already been granted. 

A recent number of The Domin- 
ion, a paper published at Welling- 
ton, New Zealand, devotes several 



columns to a report of the proceed- 
ings of the Presbyterian General 
Assembly, most of the time being- 
occupied by a discussion of the 
question whether the Bible should 
be read in the public schools. The 
general sentiment was in favor of 
the adoption of the "Australian sys- 
tem." It was explained that : 

"The system consists of (a) simple 
Scriptural lessons read during school 
hours by the children from a book 
provided by the Department of Pub- 
lic Instruction exclusively for this 
purpose. The work of the state school 
teacher is restricted to seeing that the 
child understands the lesson as intelli- 
gently as any other lesson. The 
teacher does not give either sectarian 
or dogmatic teaching. 

"(b) The churches have the oppor- 
tunity afforded them to sending their 
ministers of religion or other accred- 
ited teachers into the schools during 
school hours to teach the children the 
faith of their fathers in their respec- 
tive denominations. In the larger 
centers, such as cities and towns, 
ministers of religion, or accredited 
substitutes, would have an opportunity 
of instructing their own children. In 
many cases, and especially in those 
of smaller churches, mutual arrange- 
ments are made between the churches 
by which the children are grouped to- 
gether, and, with the consent of the 
individual parent, attend the class of 
a minister not of their own church. 
In the smaller schools in the country 
districts, these visits are paid less fre- 
quently than in towns. The executive 
of the league includes representa- 
tives of the Anglican, Presbyterian, 
and Methodist churches; also the Sal- 
vation Army." 

"In support of the action that this 
system be adopted in New Zealand, 
it was stated that its introduction in 
the schools would settle the contro- 
versy concerning denominational 
schools for Roman Catholics. Under 
this proposed system, it was said, the 
Roman Catholic clergy, equally with 
others, would be permitted to give a 
certain measure of religious instruc- 
tion to children of their own faith. It 
would end once and for all what was 
a most difficult problem." 



ELDER JOSEPH IV. McMURRIN . 



It is my understanding that in our 
neighbor on the north, the Domin- 
ion of Canada, the law provides for 
the children of various faiths to re- 
ceive religious instruction from 
ministers who have been appointed 
for the purpose by and with the ap- 
proval of the parents of the chil- 
dren who are to be so taught. 

Recently there was received in 
the Religion Class Board offices in 
this city a letter from Garry, In- 
diana, asking that literature in rela- 
tion to the Religion Class work of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints might be forwarded 
to give assistance in the preparation 
of material for the children of the 
public schools in that section of the 
country. I will read a paragraph 
or two : 

"My dear Sirs: 

"I presume that you are acquainted 
with the movement in Garry for the 
establishment of week-day church 
schools by the Protestant denomina- 
tions, worked out on the basis of co- 
operation and co-relation with the 
public school system. 

"The various denominations at 
large are beginning to focus their at- 
tention and strength in an effort to 
standardize the curriculum for the en- 
tire denomination. At the outset, we 
shall be led into federation along sev- 
eral lines, especially the literature 
from which we will build up our new 
courses of study to serve as a teach- 
er's working library, and as a refer- 
ence and reading list for the pupils. 
This new and inevitable type of school 
will call for a searching evolution of 
all religious literature. The plan 
which the librarian and I have in view 
will show the country a new use and 
demand for religious educational liter- 
ature, and the result will certainly 
have direct bearing upon the publish- 
ing interest. 

"I am a member of the Board of 
Sunday Schools of the Methodist 
Episcopal church, and have been ap- 
pointed since April, and have been 
here since June 1. I realize that all 
kinds of demands and requests are 
made for the courtesy of your pub- 



lications. Did I not know that our 
aim is to use religious literature as 
never before, but in such a way as the 
public schools use reference and text 
books, I would not feel justified as a 
representative of the Methodist church 
to ask that you put at our disposal 
literature which would help me in 
building up our courses of study, and 
serve as a standard text and refer- 
ences for reading and consultation." 

We must conclude from this 
communication that the religion 
class work of the Latter-day Saints 
is attracting attention far away from 
our mountain home. 

My brethren and sisters, when we 
think of nineteen million souls being 
more or less interested in the need 
of religious training in the public 
schools, here in our own land, to 
say nothing of the same sentiment 
so strongly working upon the minds 
of men in other countries, we should 
discern the wisdom of our leaders 
as shown in their action of twenty- 
four years ago. 

I simply refer to these matters to ' 
bring to the attention of presiding 
men the fact that the work that was 
introduced under the inspiration of 
the Spirit of God by the Presidency 
of the Church at the time mentioned, 
begins to work its way in the world. 
It has taken a long time for some 
men to make the discovery that 
there is necessity of training of this 
character, but the light is beginning 
to come, and it ought to be an evi- 
dence to those who are engaged in 
religion class work, that it is most 
important, and those upon whom 
responsibility rests in seeking the 
establishment of the work, should 
go forward with determination, for 
surely the Lord is in the work. I 
would like to bring to the attention 
of this congregation the fact that in 
this organization we have one of 
the First Presidency of the Church 
as general superintendent, President

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Anthon H. Lund; we have two of 
the Council of the Apostles as his 
assistants, Rudger Clawson and 
Hyrum M. Smith. President Charles 
W. Penrose and more than half of 
the entire quorum of the apostles 
are members of the Religion Class 
Board ; there is no better authority 
in any board. We have voted for 
many, many years in the general 
conferences of the Church sustain- 
ing this organization, making cove- 
nant that we will support these 
brethren who have been called to 
preside and direct in the work. 

The time for discussion as to the 
advisability of the establishment of 
the organization has passed away 
many years ago. It is one of the 
organizations of the Church! There 
is abundant room for it in every set- 
tlement where there are children of 
the Latter-day Saints. As this is 
the time of the year when the work 
is particularly taken up I have felt 
that it would not be inappropriate 
to call the attention of local presid- 
ing authorities to the necessity that 
exists in the organization for en- 
couragement, and for assistance 
from these presiding men. I wish to 
say to those who are engaged in the 
work that there cannot be anything 
that is of greater importance, or 
that can be more honorable in the 
labors with which men and women 
have to do, than the planting of a 
knowledge of the truth in the hearts 
of the rising generation. The men 
who have occupied this position dur- 
ing the past three days, testify that 
they know this work as a whole has 
been revealed from on High, that 
Joseph Smith was raised up as an 
instrument in the hands of our 
Father to usher in the great dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times. I sup- 
pose we all believe the solemn testi- 
monies that have been delivered, and 



if we believe, then we should re- 
ceive with all our hearts the organ- 
izations that have been given of our 
Father in heaven for the education 
of the rising generation, that our 
children after us may be established 
in the faith of the everlasting Gos- 
pel, the Gospel of salvation, the Gos- 
pel of power, the Gospel of living 
faith that has come down from the 
heavens for the blessing of men. I 
encourage with all my soul those 
who are engaged in this good organ- 
ization to lend their very best efforts 
to the accomplishment of the work 
allotted to them, that the truth of 
God may be planted in the hearts of 
the children who are in the public 
schools. Oh how great is the need 
of that truth, for there is much in 
the schools of today that is in oppo- 
sition to the things of God, much 
that undermines faith in the exist- 
ence of our Father in heaven. We 
need to bring to the children in 
every possible manner those princi- 
ples that will establish them in the 
faith, and that will prepare them for 
the responsibilities of the future. 

I gladly join my brethren in testi- 
mony concerning the work of God. 
Testimony has come to me as it has 
come to my brethren, not by birth, 
not by information obtained from 
books alone, but by the inspiration 
of the Holy Spirit. God has made 
me understand measureably the 
truth of the great work He planted 
when the Father and the Son were 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, when holy angels laid their 
hands upon his head and bestowed 
upon him the authority of the Holy 
Priesthood, the power to minister in 
the name of the Redeemer. The 
preaching of that gospel found 
the hearts of my father and mother, 
they obeved it while they were in a 
far-off distant land years before my 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

birth, the truth then received was 
powerful enough to bring them to 
this Zion of our God. It filled their 
souls with peace, and joy, and con- 
tentment, as long as they lived upon 
the earth. I know now better than 
I used to know 7 , how anxious that 
good father and mother were that 
their spns and daughters should re- 
ceive the truth and know that the 
message that found lodgment in 
their hearts was the power of God 
unto salvation. When their chil- 
dren were brought to understand 
the truth, it was through searching 
for it, when they manifested that 
they were willing to practice the 
principles revealed, and keep the 
commandments of God, they discov- 
ered as their parents before them 
discovered, that our Father in 
heaven was near at hand, no respec- 
tor of persons. He revealed to 
those children by the power of the 
Holy Ghost the truth of the religion 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the 
power of God. Truth has come 
down from the heavens. It is the 
decree of our Father in heaven that 
it shall remain, and be, the marvel- 
ous work and wonder as the Father 
said in the very beginning of this 
dispensation, through the mouth of 
the Prophet Joseph. Thank God 
that knowledge has come into my 
soul. I hope to keep it, I hope to 
see it come to the souls of my sons 
and daughters, and that from gen- 
eration to generation there shall be 
found in the midst of Israel the sons 
and daughters of that good old 
father and mother who gave up all 
for the Gospel's sake. God grant it 
to all fathers and mothers, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER CHARLES K HART. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

During the early pari of the ex- 
cellent reign of Hezekian, king of 
Judah, he failed in some particular 
to stand to the covenants of the 
fathers, and he was prevailed 
against by the Assyrian;;, under 
King Shalmaneser. Later, this 
great young ruler realized his mis- 
take, and as the Assyrians came 
against him again, under their then 
king, Sennecherib, Hezekiah sent 
word to them : 

"I have offended; return to me: that 
which, thou puttest on me will I bear. 
And the king of Assyria appointed 
unto Hezekiah king of ."iwlah three 
hundred talents of silver and thirty 
talents of gold. And Hezekiah gave 
him all the silver that was found in 
the house of the Lord, and in the 
treasures of the king's house. At that 
time did Hezekiah cut off the gold 
from the doors of the temple of the 
Lord, and from the pillar?; which 
Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, 
and gave it to the king of Assyria." 

The king was not only willing to 
arbitrate, but he was willing that his 
enemy should be the arbiter. Then, 
when he had placed him c elf right, hi 
became the recipient of divine aid 
against the enemy by the angel of 
the Lord, as recounted by the poet 
Byron. 

The principle of arbitration is a 
plant of very slow growth ; like the 
century plant, its period' of flower- 
ing are far between. The historian 
Xenophon tells us that Cyrus was 
willing to arbitrate interstate ques- 
tions, and submitted to an Indian 
king one such question with As- 
syria. Thncydides the Greek, de- 
clares that ''it is wicked 1o proceed 
against him as a wrong doer who 
is ready, to refer the question to an 
arbitrator." That declaration, I 
might say inspired declaration, (for

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ji was certainly a -very great prin- 
ciple advanced in those early cen- 
turies B. C. >, has been often quoted 
%vith approval, and yet it bears fruit 
slowly. Hugo Grotius-, the great 
writer on international law in the 
fore part' of the seventeenth century, 
declares in favor of that great doc- 
trine, and states that it should be 
especially observed by Christians 
and by Christian nations. Grotius 
may fairly be called the father of 
international law. As an evidence 
of appreciation of him, our govern- 
ment instructed jts representative to 
place upon his grave a silver wreath, 
properly inscribed. This was done 
July 4, 1899, and appropriate words 
of appreciation were uttered by an 
eloquent representative of the gov- 
ernment of the United States. 

Greece, in her early history, had 
her amphictionic council, seeking 
to mitigate the horrors of war, and 
by agreement to curtail them ; and 
the representatives of the twelve 
:ibes of Hellas comprising that sub- 
council, were under oath to observe 
those rules. King Henry the IV 
of France made some effort at in- 
, terstate arbitration. William Penn 
declared in favor of it, and our own 
government has successfully prac- 
ticed it. The United States and 
Great Britain successfully arbitrated 
some of the serious questions grow- 
ing out of the Civil War; and we 
have what is called the Treaty of 
Washington, and the Award of 
Geneva,'' in 1871. In 1890 the gov- 
ernment of the United States de- 
clared in favor of International ar- 
bitration; and Great Britain some 
three years afterward passed a reso- 
lution in approval of the doctrine 
advanced by the government of the 
I Jnited States upon this principle. 

Some are inclined to make light 
of the great work of the Hague 
Peace Conference, called by the 



Czar of Russia. It came from a 
source then not expected, but he set 
forth clearly the reason and the ne- 
cessity for such a call, and the open- 
ing there was very propitious. The 
Minister of State of the Nether- 
lands called attention to some of 
their allegorical paintings in the 
building in which they met, partic- 
ularly one, the figure of peace en- 
tering the room to close the door 
of the temple of Janus, and he trust- 
ed that this picture would be typical 
of the work of the convention. Al- 
though all the nations seemed to 
realize the terrible burden they were 
placing upon their people in the ever 
increasing military and naval arma- 
ments, and the ever increasing war 
budgets, yet they were unable to 
come to any agreement with refer- 
ence to limitation of armaments, or 
a curtailment of their war budgets ; 
but they did a splendid thing in es- 
tablishing a permanent court of ar- 
bitration — not enforced arbitration, 
but a tribunal to which the nations 
might voluntarily go with confi- 
dence. All the signatory nations — 
and they were all who had repre- 
sentatives at the Czar's court at the 
time this rescript was sent forth, all 
joined in establishing this court, and 
each was privileged to appoint in 
equal numbers, members of that 
court to serve for a definite period, 
and to appoint their successors. 
When the misunderstandings oc- 
curred between Great Britain and 
France and some other nations with 
Venezuela they did not think it was 
beneath their dignity nor that their 
honor would be in any wise affected 
by submitting to arbitration their 
differences with little Venezuela ; 
and we had the beautiful spectacle 
of twelve of the great nations inter- 
ested in that arbitration, selecting 
from the Hague court representa- 
tives of Austria and of Russia to 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



form the tribunal which passed upon 
that case, which they did with a 
good deal of satisfaction. 

Great military men have spoken 
strenuously against the horrors of 
war. Napoleon said it was the "bus- 
iness of barbarism," and Napoleon 
should know, for he had led into 
Russia six hundred thousand men 
and brought only twenty thousand 
of them back. It is estimated that 
in the Napoleonic wars four million 
men lost their lives. Wellington 
■said, "Take my word for it, if you 
had ever seen but one day of war, 
you would pray Almighty God that 
you might never see such a thing 
again." Germany has a maxim that 
' "a great war leaves a country . with 
three armies — an army of cripples, 
an army of mourners, and an army 
of thieves." In 1865, General 
Sherman said in reference to war : 

"I confess without shame that I am 
sick and tired of war. Its glory is all 
moonshine. Even success, the most 
brilliant, is over dead and mangled 
bodies, the anguish and lamentations 
of distant families, appealing to me 
for missing sons, husbands and 
fathers. It is only those who have 
never heard a shot, nor the shrieks 
and groans of wounded friend or foe 
who cry aloud for more blood, more 
vengeance, more desolation." 

The best authorities on war seemed 
to think, until a few months ago, 
that we had reached a time when the 
great nations of the world would 
be in war no more. Doctor David 
Starr Jordan, a real authority on 
questions of peace and war, wrote 
in 1912, in his instructive work en- 
titled, "War and Waste," under a 
chapter headed, "The Great War of 
Europe :" 

"What shall we say of the great war 
-of Europe, ever threatening, ever im- 
pending and which never comes. We 
shall say that it will never come. Hu- 



manly speaking, it is impossible, not 
in the physical sense, of course, for 
with weak, restless and Godless men 
nothing evil is impossible, It may 
be, of course, that some half-crazed 
Arch-Duke or some harassed minister 
of state shall half knowing, give the 
signal for Europe's conflagration. 
* * * The tinder is well dried and 
laid in such a way as to make the 
worst of this common catastrophy. 
All Europe cherishes is ready for the 
burning." 

After quoting statistics to show 
a European war, with Italy and Ro- 
mania included, would cost about 
$50,000,000.00 per day, Dr. Jordan 
adds : 

"The bankers will not find the 
money for such a fight, the industries 
of Europe will not and statesmen can- 
not. No matter whatever the bluster 
or apparent provocation it comes to 
the same thing at the end. There 
will be no general war until the mas- 
ters direct the fighters to fight. The 
masters have much to gain, but vastly 
more to lose and their signal will not 
be given." 

But Joseph Smith, the Prophet 
of the Lord, said that war would be 
poured out upon all nations, and 
that Great Britain should call upon 
other nations — and she is doing it 
now, calling, perchance upon even 
little Portugal. . In this instance 
the wisdom of men is placed in 
juxtaposition with the foresight 
of the Prophet. I think, with 
Brother Roberts, that while upon 
the surface it appears to be a dis- 
couraging circumstance that the 
great nations of Europe are now en- 
gaged in such a deady conflict, that 
it is but the fore-runner of a better 
peace, that it is but the dark hour 
before the dawn. 

In reading an article, by a wo- 
man, in the present number of the 
Century, I thought that the giving 
of suffrage to the women would 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



help also in this question of secur- 
ing arbitration, peaceful arbitration 
to take the place of the arbitrament 
of arms. She points out that wo- 
men know the history and the value 
of human flesh, that no woman 
would think lightly of the taking of 
human life. She writes : 

"In viewing a battlefield a woman will 
say: 'So many mother's sons; so 
many young bodies brought into the 
world to lie there; so many months of 
weariness and pain while bones and 
muscles were shaped within; so many 
hours of anguish and struggle that 
birth might be; so many baby mouths 
drawing life at women's breasts. All 
this that man might lie with glazed 
eye-balls and swollen faces and fixed, 
blue, unclosed mouths and great limbs 
tossed. This that an acre of ground 
might be manured with human flesh, 
that next year's grass, or poppies, or 
karoo bushes may spring up greener 
and redder where they have lain, or 
that the sand of the plains may have 
a glint of white bones;' and we cry: 
without an inexorable cause this must 
not be. No woman who is a woman 
says of a human being, 'It is nothing.' 

* * * She knows the history of 
human flesh. She knows its cost. 

* * * The thought would never 
come to that woman, 'cast in men's 
bodies. Settle the thing so.' " 

That was a very strong document 
addressed by the suffragists in pro- 
test against this war, respecting 
mothers of those who will lose their 
sons in the deadly conflict. 

The press dispatches gave us re- 
cently an account of a French 
mother who lost four sons in the 
present war but expressed regret 
that she had not other sons to lose 
in the same cause. I think there is 
another side to that picture. I 
think that Elizabeth Barrett Brown- 
ing in that beautiful poem entitled 
"Mother and Poet," gives us a 
glimpse of the other side, a glimpse 
of the struggle between the mother- 
love and the love for country. Her 



lines are suggested by the Italian 
warfare after news from Gaeta in 
1861, and in part are as follows: 

Dead! one of them shot by the sea in 
the east, 

And one of them shot in the west 
by the sea. 
Dead! both my boys! When you sit 

at the feast 
And are wanting a great song for 
Italy free, 

Let none look at me! 

Yet I was a poetess only last year, 
And good at my art, for a woman, 
men said. 

But this woman, this, who is agonized 
here, 

The east sea and west sea rhyme on 
in her head 

Forever instead. 

What art can a woman be good at? 
Oh vain! 

What art is she good at, but hurting 
her breast 
W r ith the milk-teeth of babes, and a 

smile at the pain? 
Ah, boys, how you hurt! you were 
strong as you pressed, 
And / proud, by that test. 

What art's for a woman? To hold on 

her knees 
Both darlings! to feel all their arms 

round her throat 
Cling, strangle a little! To sew by 

degrees, 

And "broider the long clothes and 
neat little coat! 

To dream and to dote. 

To teach them * * * It strings 
there. / made them indeed 
Speak plain the word "country." I 
taught them, no doubt, 
That a country's a thing men should 
die for at. need. 
/ prated of lib.erty, rights, and about 
The tyrant turned put. 

And when their eyes flashed * * * 
"O my beautiful eyes!" 
I exulted! nay, let them go forth at 
the wheels 
Of the guns, and denied not. But then 
the surprise, 
When one sits quite alone! Then 
one weeps, then one kneels! 
— God! how the house feels.

Then follow verses descriptive of 
letters received from her soldier 
sons, and the manner of receiving 
news of the death of first one and 
then the other of her boys. As the 
crowd cheered in the streets of 
Turin she fell at their feet. Susbti- 
tute the name of one or the other of 
the nations now contending, and we. 
can imagine to some extent the feel- 
ings of some of the mothers, num- 
bered now by the million, whose 
sons have either been recently slain 
or wounded or are now on the fir- 
ing line. The poet continues: 

O Christ of the seven wounds, who 
look'dst through the dark 
To the face of Thy mother! con- 
sider, I pray, 
How we common mothers stand des- 
olate, mark, 
Whose sons, not being Christs, die 
with eyes turned away. 
And no last word to say! 

Bothi boys dead! but that's out of na- 
ture. We all 
Have been patriots, yet each house 
must always keep one. 

'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to 
a wall. 

And, when Italy's made, for what 
end is it done 

If we have not a son? 

Ah, ah, ah! when Gaeta's taken, what 
then? 

When the fair wicked queen sits no 
more at her sport 
Of the fire-balls of death crashing 
souls out of men? 
When vour guns of Cavalli with 
final retort 

Have cut the game short, — 

When Venice and Rome keep their 
new jubilee, 
When your flag takes all heaven for 
its white, gren, and red, 
When you have your country from 
mountain to sea. 
When King Victor has Italy s 
crown on his head, 

(And I have my dead), ■ 

Whn<- then? Do not mock me. Ah, 
ring your bells low, 



And burn your lights faintly. My 
country is there, 
Above the star pricked bv the last 

peak of snow: 
My Italy's there — with my brave 
civic pair, 

To disfranchise despair. 

Forgive me. Some women bear chil- 
dren in strength, * 
And bite back the cry of their pain 
in self-scorn. 
But the birth-pangs of nations will 
wring us at length 
Into wail such as this! — and we 
sit on forlorn 

When the man-child is born. 

Dead! — one of them shot by the sea 

in the west! 
And one of them shot in the east 

by the sea! 
Both! both my boys! — if in keeping 

the feast 

You want a great song for your 
Italy free, 

Let none look at me! 

We had an able talk from Doctor. 
Talmage at the Sunday School 
meeting on the "foundations of 
peace." So we might consider the 
"foundations of war." Militarism is 
one of the corner stones in the 'foun- 
dations • of war. Israel Zangwill 
gives us these strong lines: 

"To safeguard peace, we must prepare 
for war. 

1 know that maxim — it was forged in 
hell." 

Of course there must be an ade- 
quate police force for each nation, 
but it is inexcusable to let the debt 
for armaments and standing armies 
run into what has been called ^the 
"endless procession of ciphers." or 
for a nation to enter noon the "pro- 
cession toward the abyss." Tt is 
follv to have a peace that is a "peace 
of force" which may be transmuted 
at any time into a peace of bank- 
ruptcy of exhaustion. But a peace 
resting upon that foundation which 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



has been explained by the brethren 
during this conference will be what 
has been called "the old peace with 
velvet-sandalled feet ;" and may that 
time come, the time foreseen by Isa- 
iah and by Micah when the swords 
should be beaten into plow-shares 
and the spears into pruning hooks. 
I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

CLOSING ADDRESS. 

Conquer sin in self, and assist others 
in war against evil — Truth and Jus- 

• tice the foundation of Peace — Bless- 
ings of Peace invoked upon the 
Saints — Sisters admonished to be ex- 
emplary in dress, etc. 

I feel very grateful for the excel- 
lent peace and spirit which has per- 
vaded all our meetings. It is true, 
we are all engaged in a warfare, and 
all of us should be valiant warriors 
in the cause in which we are en- 
gaged. Our first enemy we will 
find within ourselves. It is a good 
thing to overcome that enemy first, 
and bring ourselves into subjection 
to the will of the Father, and into 
strict obedience to the principles of 
life and salvation which He has 
given to the world for the salvation 
of men. When we shall have con- 
quered ourselves, it will be well for 
us to wage our war without, against 
false teachings, false doctrines, false 
customs, habits and ways, against 
error, unbelief, the follies of the 
world that are so prevalent, and 
against infidelity, and false science 
under the name of science, and ev- 
ery other thing that strikes at the 
foundations of the principles set 
forth in the doctrine of Christ for 
the redemption of men and the sal- 
vation of their souls. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



We should war against covetous- 
ness, against pride, vanity, haughti- 
ness of spirit, against self-sufficien- 
cy, and imagined or supposed al- 
mighty power that some people 
think they possess.,, God is the 
greatest man of war of all, and His 
Son is next unto Him, and their 
warfare is for the salvation of the 
souls of men. It would not be 
necessary for them to use violence 
or force, nor to permit their children 
to use violence nor force in order 
to conquer if they would but hum- 
ble themselves, and obey the truth. 
For, after all, nothing will conquer 
nothmg will win but the truth ; and 
so far as the wars that are going on 
in the world are concerned, we not 
only want to see peace established 
among the children of men, but also 
justice, but above all things, truth. 
that justice, peace and righteous- 
ness may be built upon this founda- 
tion and not depend upon the cov- 
etousness, pride, vanity, evil desire, 
and lust for power in men. 
/ That is what we want ; and I pray 
that the spirit of truth may be poured 
out upon all men, as well as the 
spirit of peace. In fact, we will 
never have peace until we have 
truth. We will never be able to es- 
tablish peace on earth and good will 
until we have drunk at the foun- 
tains of righteousness and eternal 
truth, as God has revealed it to man. 

This is my testimony to you, and 
I desire to emphasize these simple 
thoughts, and say to all my breth- 
ren and sisters : Let us conquer our- 
selves, and then go to and conquer 
all the evil that we see around us, 
as far as we possibly can. And we 
will do it without using violence ; we 
will do it without interfering with 
the agency of men or of women. 
We will do it by persuasion, by long- 
suffering, by patience, and by for- 



giveness and love unfeigned, by 
which we will win the hearts, the 
affections and the souls of the chil- 
dren of men to the truth, as God 
has revealed it to us. We will never 
have peace, nor justice, nor truth, 
until we look to the only true foun- 
tain for it, and receive from the 
fountain-head. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters ; I thank you for your attend- 
ance, for it has been a strength to 
us, and it has given us consolation 
and comfort to see you here and to 
know that you are here because you 
love the truth, just as we love it ; 
and many of you love it even more 
than some of us know how to love 
it. For I know of people in the 
world who are true Latter-day 
Saints from the very core ; they do 
not have many things to contend 
against in themselves, either. It is 
easy for them to be Latter-day 
Saints, and truly the children of 
God, because they love the truth 
and they live pure lives, many of 
them. 1 am satisfied of it. Many 
there-be, however, who have a good 
deal to fight against within them- 
selves, and some of us are not any 
better than we ought to be. Such 
will doubtless gain a great reward 
if they conquer. 

Now, in conclusion, let us go 
home,thoseof us who are relieved to 
go home, carrying with us the spirit 
of the Gospel, rejoicing that we 
'have the liberty that we enjoy, 
the liberty to worship God ac- 
cording to the dictates of our 
own conscience, and according to 
the promptings of the testimony 
and of the Spirit of God within us ; 
and let us abide in the truth. My 
.blessing I give to you. May peace 
dwell in your hearts. May it abide 
and abound in your homes. May 
you be blessed in your outgoings

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and incomings, when you lie down 
and rise up, in your basket and in 
your store, in your business and in 
all your lawful and worthy trans- 
actions of life, and in your minis- 
trations for the salvation of man- 
kind; the Lord bless you in it. 

One word more. I wish to say to 
my sisters, and especially to those 
who are called to be teachers among 
their sex : Please set the example 
before your sisters that God would 
have them follow. When we teach 
people to observe the laws of God 
and to honor the gifts that are be- 
stowed upon them in the covenants 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we 
don't want you teachers to go out 
and set an example before your sis- 
ters that will destroy their faith in 
our teachings. I hope you will take 
that to heart, for it has a meaning 
to it. I am talking to the teachers 
among the sisters. We hear it re- 
ported, from time to time, that 
some of the teachers that are sent 
out among our sisters not only do 
not set the example that they ought 
to set, but they set the example that 
they should not set for our sis- 
ters, they teach them by example to 
break the word of wisdom, rather 
than to keep it. They teach them 
to mutilate their garments, rather 
than to keep them holy and unde- 
filed, by setting the example before 
them, and we can tell you the names 
if you want to know. I am not 
scolding ; I don't want it to be under- 
stood that I am finding fault, I am 
only telling a solemn truth, and I am 
sorry that I have it to say, but I 
want it to be distinctly understood. 
We see some of our good sisters 



coming here to the Temple 'occa- 
sionally decorated in the latest ai 
most ridiculous fashions that ever 
disgraced the human form divine. 
They do not seem to realize that 
they are coming to the house of 
God, and we have to forbid them 
entrance, or find fault with them, and 
they go away grieved and say some- 
times, 'We don't want to go there 
any more." Why? Because they 
come unprepared, like the man who 
was found at the feast without the 
wedding garment, who also had to 
be turned out (Matt. 22 :1-14). We 
have to turn them out occasionally,, 
because they will not hearken to the 
counsel that has been given to them. 
jMay the Lord have mercy upon us, 
and bless and help us to do our duty 
in all things, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The 
Doxology." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Hyrum G. Smith. 

Conference adjourned for six

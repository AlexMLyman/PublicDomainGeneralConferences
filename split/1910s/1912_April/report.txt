Eighty- Second Annual Conference 

of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints 



FIRST DAY 



The Eighty-Second Annual Con- 
ference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints con- 
vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, at 10 a. m. Friday, April 5, 
1912, President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

AUTHORITIES PRESENT. 

There were present of the First 
Presidency, Joseph F. Smith, An- 
thon H. Lund, and Charles W. Pen- 
rose ; of the Council of the Twelve 
Apostles, Francis M. Lyman, Heber 
J. Grant, FLyrum M. Smith, George 
F. Richards, Orson F. Whitney, 
David O. McKay. Anthony W. 
Ivins, Joseph F. Smith, Jr., and 
James E. Talmage ; of the First 
Council of Seventies, Seymour B. 
Young, Brigham H. Roberts, J. 
Golden Kimball, Rulon S. Wells, 
Joseph W. McMurrin and Charles 
H. Hart; (Levi Edgar Young was 
in attendance at later sessions) ; of 
the presiding Bishopric, Charles W. 
Nibley, Orrin P. Miller, and David 
A. Smith. There were also a large 
number of Presidents of Stakes 
with their Counselors, Presidents of 



missions, Bishops of Wards, Pa- 
triarchs, and numerous other prom- 
inent men and women representing 
various quorums and organizations 
of the Church. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and the con- 
ference services were commenced 
by the choir and congregation sing- 
ing the hymn : 



Come, come ye saints, no toil nor labor 

fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
'Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this and joy your hearts will swell — 
All is well ! all is well ! 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Moses W. Taylor. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

An angel from on high 
The long, long silence broke ; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words he spoke : 

Lo ! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 

A sacred record lies concealed.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Joy derived laboring in cause of Truth 
— Enemies arrayed against Church 
on false premises — Temporal and 
spiritual condition of Church members 
highly satisfactory — Each faithful 
Saint enitled to personal revelation- 
Charge of "Commercialism" repudi- 
ated—Tithing disbursement supervised 
by eighteen honest men — Consistency 
in prayer — Development throughout 
eternity. 

I feel very grateful for the priv- 
ilege I enjoy of meeting with you 
here at the opening session of this, 
the eig"hty-second anniversary of the 
annual Conference of the Church. 
I esteem it a great privilege to be 
pemitted to live and be associated 
with my brethren and sisters in the 
great cause in which we are en- 
gaged. Personally, I have nothing 
but this cause to live for, for the rest 
of my life. It has been very much, 
almost entirely the object of life 
with me, ever since my childhood: 
and I am very thankful that I have 
had the privilege of being connected 
with the missionary work of the 
Church, and I hope and trust that I 
may be able to continue in this min- 
istry the remainder of my days. I 
feel in my heart that there is noth- 
ing greater for me, or for any other 
man living, than to be identified 
with the cause of truth, and I ver- 
ily believe that we are engaged in 
the cause of truth, and not error. 

It is a source of gratitude also, 
and pleasure, to Latter-day Saints, 
to know that their enemies are not 
and have not been opposed, openly 
and avowedly, to the principles 
which we have espoused. As a 
rule, the opposition arrayed against 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints has been arrayed 
against us from false premises, and 



instead of our religion and the 
principles of the Gospel, which we 
have embraced, being attacked by 
our enemies, as a general thing, they 
have been attacking those things 
which they have falsely laid to our 
charge and of which we are not 
guilty. Our enemies would not ap- 
pear to be very consistent to oppose 
the principle of revelation from God 
to man. They would not appear 
very consistent to oppose the Lat- 
ter-day Saints for believing in the 
fact that the Lord Almighty is quite 
as capable of revealing Himself to 
the children of men in this dispen- 
sation as He ever was ; and, there- 
fore, when our enemies oppose us, 
or our faith in these principles, it 
is on the false premises that we 
only profess to but do not believe 
in them. They cannot, surely, ar- 
ray themselves against the princi- 
ple of faith in God and in His abil- 
ity to reveal Himself in our age of 
the world as He has ever been able 
to reveal Himself to the children of 
men ; but they claim that we pre- 
tend to believe in these things when 
there is no such thing. Well, they 
are responsible for saying there isn't 
any such thing as revelation now ; 
we are not responsible for that. On 
the contrary, we are responsible for 
declaring to the world that God has 
revealed Himself to man in this 
dispensation ; and that He has done 
so to be consistent with Himself 
and with His eternal purposes, that 
He might make Himself known to 
His children in this age as well as 
in any other age of the world. And 
so we might go seriatim, through- 
out every doctrine and principle of 
the Church which has excited op- 
position in the world, and we will 
find that it is not always the truth 
that they are fighting, but it is 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



their construction of our views 
from their points of view. They 
charge us with errors of which we 
are not guilty. They charge us 
with acts that we have never per- 
formed, and with conduct that is 
entirely at variance and inconsistent 
with our lives and history. They 
have framed, in their minds, acts 
and beliefs and practices that the 
Church of Christ, never in any 
sense, has been guilty of or con- 
nected with ; and yet they charge 
us with doing these things. To be 
more plain in the matter, to illus- 
trate what I desire to convey to 
you : They charge us with being 
corrupt, with having practiced cor- 
rupt principles. They charge us 
with having been seclusive and op- 
posed to the world, opposed to our 
national government, opposed to 
good, true, and wholesome laws, 
and to works of righteousness. 
Really, they charge us with being 
murderers, adulterers, and all man- 
ner of evil-doers. Much the same 
as was charged against the Son of 
God and the ancient Saints. They 
distort what we do believe into 
something that is entirely contrary 
to our belief, and then proceed to 
array themselves against us. 

Now, let me say to you, if our 
enemies desire to oppose the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
because we believe, with all our 
souls, in the divinity of Christ and 
the precepts and principles which 
He taught; if they are opposed to 
us because* we believe that these 
principles have been restored again 
to the earth in this dispensation, 
and we have espoused them and are 
tying to live them the best we can, 
we have no fault to find with them. 
Let them find fault with our faith 



as much as they will. We shall not 
complain of them, although we 
would regret exceedingly that they 
do not comprehend the truth as 
we comprehend it. I cannot find 
fault with my enemy for charging 
me with earnest and honest belief 
in the divinity of the mission of 
Jesus Christ. I cannot find fault 
with Him for charging me with be- 
lieving in the divine mission of 
Joseph Smith. I cannot find fault 
with him for charging me with hav- 
ing faith in God, in Christ, and 
in the Holy Spirit, and for believ- 
ing in repentance of sin and depart- 
ing from it, and in the principle of 
baptism by immersion, for the re- 
mission of sins, and in the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. If they will charge me with 
these things, I shall not complain 
of them; but if they should charge 
me with falsely believing in them, 
or merely pretending to believe in 
them, they would be placing me in 
a false light, and would be charg- 
ing me with that which is not true. 
It is in this light that I have spoken 
of this matter as I have. The world 
do not oppose us for what we do, 
but they oppose us for what they 
charge us with doing, which we do 
not do. 

Our mission has been to save 
men. We have been laboring all 
these eighty odd years, of the 
Church to bring men to a knowl- 
edge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
to Wing them to repentance, to 
obedience to the requirements of 
God's law. We have been striving 
to save men from error, to persuade 
them to turn away from evil and 
to learn to do good. Now, if our 
enemies will only charge us with 
doing this, all right; and if they 
wish to oppose us f ' doing this,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that is their business ; but when 
they charge us with doing that 
which we have not done, believing 
that which we do not believe, prac- 
ticing that which we have never 
practiced, then I pity them. I pity 
them because they are doing it in 
ignorance, or because they are wil- 
fully disposed to misrepresent the 
truth. 

I desire to say that, in my judg- 
ment, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was never in 
a better condition spiritually or 
temporally than it is today. I be- 
lieve that our priesthood quorums 
are in as good condition today as 
they ever were in the Church. I 
think, if possible, they are more 
effectually and efficiently organized, 
and in better working condition 
than ever they were before. I be- 
lieve that the faith of the Latter- 
day Saints in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, in the divinity of the mis- 
sion of Joseph Smith, is as good 
and as great today as it ever was, 
if it is not better. I believe that 
there is as much union and fellow- 
ship in the Church as ever did ex- 
sit in it. I don't intend or mean 
to say that we have not, occasion- 
ally, discontented people, fault- 
finders. I presume tnat we will al- 
ways have a few of them ; but I 
do not believe that there were 
ever fewer of them proportionately 
than there are now. 1 do not be- 
lieve that ever before, the Latter- 
day Saints generally understood the 
principles of their religion better 
than they understand them todav. T 
do not believe that they were ever 
firmer in the faith, and I believe 
with all my soul that the Church is 
growing today quite as fast as in 
any period of its existence. I 
am quite satisfied in my own 



mind that the presiding author- 
ities of the Church were never 
more united than they are and never 
stood firmer together than they do 
now. I believe that the presidents 
of the stakes of Zion, at any other 
period of the Church's history, were 
never more faithful or more dili- 
gent in the performance of their 
duties than they now are. This 
is my judgment, from my point of 
view ; and I think that, from my 
point of view, we are as capable 
of judging of these conditons as 
any men can be. We have no rea- 
son to complain, no reason to be in 
doubt. 

Let me say, too, that I believe 
that the spirituality of the people 
of God, the people of this Church, 
is as great as it ever was. It has 
been charged, by public speakers 
abroad, and by men who we might 
suppose occupied positions in the 
community enabling them to know 
better, that the "Mormon" Church 
is losing its spirituality, that the 
spiritual things of the Church are 
waning among them. This is as 
false as can be. Let me say for 
their instruction, if such individuals 
will receive instruction from me, 
that there is not a man, or woman, 
or child, who is in fellowship or in 
good standing in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
that has not received, by the lay- 
ing on of hands, of those who have 
power and authority to confer bless- 
ings from the Lord to the children 
of men, the gift of the Holy Ghost — 
every man, every woman, and every 
child that has been baptized into 
the Church. Where will you go, 
outside of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, to find 
a church or a religious community, 
no matter what its name or charac- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

ter may be, that has received an 
equal advantage with this? where 
will you go to find a people, in the 
world, on whom has been conferred 
the gift of the Holy Spirit, by the 
laying on of hands? So far, then, 
from the truth is this statement that 
the Church is losing its spirituality, 
it is receiving additional gifts of 
the Spirit of God in every member 
of the Church added to it. And the 
spirit of inspiration, the gift of rev- 
elation does not belong to one man 
solely; it is not a gift that pertains 
to the Presidency of the Church 
and the Twelve Apostles alone. It 
is not confined to the presiding au- 
thorities of the Church, it belongs 
to every individual member of the 
Church ; and it is the right and priv- 
ilege of every man, every woman, 
and every child who has reached 
the years of accountability, to enjoy 
the spirit of revelation, and to be 
possessed of the spirit of inspiration 
in the discharge of their duties as 
members of the Church. It is the 
privilege of every individual mem- 
ber of the Church to have revelation 
for his own guidance, for the direc- 
tion of his life and conduct ; and 
therefore I aver — and I believe I 
may do so without any reasonable 
chance for it being gainsaid or op- 
posed — that there is not another 
church in the world, or an organiza- 
tion of religious people, who are so 
universally spiritual in their lives, 
and who are so universally entitled 
to the gifts of the Spirit of God as 
are the members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
You are all entitled to revelation. It 
is your privilege to have it revealed 
to you whether I am a servant of 
God or a servant of men ; whether 
I am in the discharge of my duty 
or not; whether I, as a presiding 



officer in the Church, am acting in 
the discharge of my duty acceptably 
to you and the Lord. It is your 
privilege to have revelation in re- 
gard to this, and to know the truth 
yourselves. And it is my privilege 
to have revelation from God, as an 
individual, for my own temporal 
guidance, as well as for my spirit- 
ual guidance; and I repeat again 
that there never was a time in the 
earth, since the Church was organ- 
ized, when the spirituality of the 
people of God was greater than it 
is today. 

The Church is charged with com- 
mercialism. There is not the least 
semblance of it, in truth. The 
Church is neither buying nor selling 
goods or chattels. It is not engaged 
in merchandising of any descrip- 
tion, and never has been; and there 
could not well be a more false and 
groundless statement made against 
the Church than to charge it with 
commercialism. It is true that, un- 
like other churches or religious or- 
ganizations, the people of this 
Church observe the law of tithing, 
which is the law of revenue of the 
Church. We do not pass around 
the hat to you, or the collection box, 
for means to defray the expenses in- 
cident to the carrying on of the 
work of the Church. You give it 
voluntarily. This reminds me of 
another falsehood that is spread 
abroad by our enemies, namely : 
That the "Mormon" people are 
compelled to pay tithing, that the 
authorities of the Church demand 
it of them, that it is made obligatory 
upon them, and is tyrannically ex- 
acted from them all the time, 
which is an infamous falsehood, a 
slander, for there is not a word or 
syllable of truth in it. The ob- 
servance of the law of tithing is 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



voluntary. I can pay my tithing 
or not, as I choose. It is a matter 
of choice with me, whether I will 
do it or not do it; but feeling, as 
I do, loyal to the Church, loyal to 
its interests, believing that it is right 
and just to observe the law of tithing 
I do observe it — on the same prin- 
ciple that I think it is right for me 
to observe the law of repentance, 
and of baptism for the remission 
of sins. It is my pleasure to do 
my duty with reference to the ob- 
servance of these principles, and 
to pay my tithing. The Lord has 
revealed how this means shall be 
cared for, and managed ; namely, 
by the Presidency of the Church and 
the High Council of the Church ; 
(that is, the Twelve Apostles), and 
the Presiding Bishopric of the 
Church. I think there is wisdom 
in this. It is not left for one man 
to dispose of it, or to handle it 
alone, not by any means. It de- 
volves upon at least eighteen men, 
men of wisdom, of faith, of ability, 
as these eighteen men are. I say it 
devolves upon them to dispose of 
the tithes of the people and to use 
them for whatever purpose in their 
judgment and wisdom will accom- 
plish the most good for the Church ; 
and because this fund of tithing is 
disposed of by these men whom the 
Lord has designated as having au- 
thority to do it, for the necessities 
and benefit of the Church, they call 
it "Commercialism." What absurd- 
ity! You may just as well call 
their practices in passing around 
their contribution boxes, for collect- 
ing means with which to build their 
church, with which to pay their 
ministers, and with which to carry 
on the monetary affairs of their 
churches, "commercialism," as for 
them to charge us with "commer- 



cialism," because we handle the tith- 
ing of the Church, and appropriate 
and use it for the benefit of the 
Church. 

Before we get through with the 
Conference, we expect to hear some 
reports from the Presiding Bishop- 
ric, who are the temporal custodians 
of the means of the Church and 
whose duty it is to account for the 
receipt and disbursement of these 
funds ; and you will be surprised, 
perhaps, to learn how generally and 
universally, in the Church, the 
means gathered from the tithes of 
the people are disposed of for the 
benefit of all the people — and not 
for a few. Then, I repeat, it is not 
that which we do, but that which 
they charge us with doing, that they 
are finding fault with. Well, let 
them find fault. It only proves 
their ignorance or their ill-feeling 
and lack of judgment in making 
complaints against the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Again, I repeat, that there are no 
more spiritually minded people on 
earth than the Latter-day Saints. 
There is no more prayerful people 
on earth than the Latter-day Saints. 
There is not another people who are 
nearer to God their Father than are 
the Latter-day Saints ; for they have 
the right to go to Him in their 
secret chamber,at the altar of prayer 
in their own homes ; they can bow 
down and get very near unto the 
Lord, nearer, I think, than anv oth- 
er people. I do not say it boastful- 
ly either; I say it as' I believe it 
to be a simple truth. Does it not 
stand to reason that a man who has 
received the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands' a man 
that has been born again of the 
water and of the Spirit, in accord- 
ance with the plan that God has in- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



stituted by which he may come into 
His fold, can get nearer to God 
than those that have not been 
born again, or those who have not 
been endowed with the Spirit of the 
Lord? Of course, it stands to rea- 
son, and it is consistent to claim 
that much for the Latter-day Saints. 
Our mothers, and the mothers of 
our children, whose hearts are filled 
with solicitude for the welfare of 
their children, having had conferred 
upon them the gift of the Holy 
Spirit, by the laying on of hands, 
can go to their secret chambers and 
bow down before God and com- 
mune with Him as no other mothers 
on earth can do, if they will only ob- 
serve the principles they have em- 
braced and will live up to their priv- 
ileges. By the influence that they 
will thus gain over the hearts of 
their children they will lead them 
in the path of righteousness and 
truth, and bring them up in the nur- 
ture and admonition of the Lord, in 
the love of truth, in obedience to His 
commands, in such a way as others 
cannot do who are destitute of these 
privileges, blessings and endow- 
ments, so freely conferred upon the 
mothers in Israel. I am aware that 
there are those who will say: "That 
is boasting; that is like the Phari- 
sees." They will liken this talk of 
mine to that of the egotistical Phari- 
see, illustrated in the parable of the 
Savior: "Oh, Lord, I thank Thee 
that I am not as other men." But 
it is not true. That would be an- 
other false charge. On the con- 
trary, it is in the same spirit that 
the sinner appealed unto the Lord : 
"Oh God, be merciful to me, a sin- 
ner." The man who possesses the 
spirit of revelation can realize 
whether he is a sinner, whether he 
is prone to evil, whether he is mag- 



nifying his standing before the 
Lord, or not, better than a man that 
has not the Spirit of the Lord in 
him, can he not? Is the man that 
is ignorant of the principles of the 
Gospel, and of the way in which he 
should reach the Father and com- 
mune with Him, more likely to be 
acceptable to God in his prayers 
than one who knows how to ap- 
proach the Lord, who has received 
the truth in his heart, who will pray 
to God in the spirit of prayer and 
true devotion. 

The Latter-day Saints possess 
that spirit; they know how to ap- 
proach the Lord; they do not call 
upon Him to be heard for "much 
speaking." When we pray, we pray 
to the Lord for that which we need, 
that which we feel is or will be good 
for us, or necessary for our well- 
being and happiness ; and when the 
Lord has blest us In our labors, 
crowned our efforts with success, 
and we have laid up, in store, an 
abundance of bread, we are not so 
inconsistent as to repeat the Lord's 
prayer : "Give us this day our daily 
bread." We do not have to do it, 
but we thank Him daily for the 
bread we have. We thank Him for 
the blessings that we enjoy, and we 
acknowledge His goodness and 
mercy in bestowing upon us the 
blessings that we possess. But we 
do not have to repeat the Lord's 
prayer, every day, which was given 
to His ministry, the apostles in an- 
cient times when they were sent out 
like lambs in the midst of wolves, 
and He taught them that they were 
not to take thought of what they 
should eat or what they should 
drink, or wherewithal they should be 
clothed ; that the Lord would feed 
them ; that the Lord would open 
the hearts of those they ministered 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



unto, to provide for their necessi- 
ties. Go, and when you pray, pray 
for what you need. What did they 
need? Bread, bread for this day. 
"Give us this day our daily bread; 
leave us not in temptation, but de- 
liver us from evil ; for Thine is the 
power, and the kingdom, and the 
glory, forever and ever." Our min- 
isters pray this prayer when they 
are out in the world depending upon 
the Lord for His goodness, and 
guidance ; but when they are at 
home with their houses supplied 
with all that is needful, and their 
granaries full, and all else that they 
need, then, instead of saying, "Oh 
Lord give us this day our daily 
bread" we say, "Oh Lord, we 
thank Thee for what Thou hast 
given us ; bless it to our good, and 
help us to make a wise and proper 
use of it." That is the way the Lat- 
ter-day Saints pray. You pray with 
intelligence ; you pray with under- 
standing ; you approach the Lord 
with a knowledge of what you 
should do, and how you should ap- 
proach Him, and how you have a 
right to ask Him for the blessings 
you need, even to the laying on of 
hands upon the sick, praying for 
them, and rebuking disease, that 
they may be healed under the bless- 
ing of the Lord ; and that the world 
does not possess. 

Now I think I have made clear, 
what I said in the beginning, that 
some people in the world are charg- 
ing us with things ^ve are not guilty 
of. They are arraigning us before 
the bar of public opinion for things 
we are strangers to, things we do 
not believe, things we have never 
done, things we have no connection 
with whatever, only in the imagina- 
tion of our enemies. When they 
charge the Church with commercial- 



ism, they charge it with that which 
is false. When they charge the 
Church with losing tlie spirituality 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, they 
charge it falsely ; it is not true. The 
Latter-day Saints do pray, and they 
are more faithful than most of the 
people of the world. Now, I may 
say, consistently, that there are good 
people in the world, people who are 
just as faithful to what they know, 
as we are faithful to what we 
know ; and I judge in some in- 
stances you will find examples of 
people out in the world who do not 
know as much as you do of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, who have not 
the testimony of the Spirit in their 
hearts as you have, of the divinity 
of Christ and of Joseph Smith, who 
are just as devout, just as humble, 
just as contrite in spirit, and as de- 
voted to what they know, as some 
of us are, and they will be reward- 
ed according to their works, every 
one of them, and will receive a re- 
ward far surpassing anything that 
they dream of. 

Some people dream, you know, 
and think, and teach that all the 
glory they ever expect to have in the 
world to come is to sit in the light 
and glory of the Son of God, and 
sing praises and songs of joy and 
gratitude all their immortal lives. 
We do not believe in any such thing. 
We believe that every man will have 
His work to do in the other world, 
just as surely as he had it to do 
here, and a greater work than 
he can do here. We believe that we 
are on the road of advancement, of 
development in knowledge, in un- 
derstanding, and in every good 
thing, and that we will continue to 
grow, advance and develop through- 
out the eternities that are before us. 
That is what we believe. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



I believe in the Latter-day Saints. 
I believe they are a people who will 
do their duty, as a general thing. 
That there are delinquents, that 
there are those who are slothful 
that there are those who are indif- 
ferent, and that there are those who 
have not the faith they should have, 
we know ; we understand that ; and 
that there are some, occasionally, 
who go wrong entirely, do wrong 
entirely ; we know and understand 
that. But the vast majority of the 
Latter-day Saints are good and 
faithful members of the Church. 
God blesses them ; they are in fel- 
lowship with Him and with each 
other. 

Now, the Lord bless you. I did 
not expect to talk so long when 
I got up, for I did not feel at all 
in the humor of talking. I have 
been suffering, for a short time, 
with a severe cold, as many others 
are at this time of the year; and I 
presume I will feel the effects of this 
exertion, a little. a But. I bear my 
testimony to you, I know the truth, 
so far as I have gone. I do not 
know it all, but what I do know, 
what I have learned, I know. Not 
only do I know the truth, so far as 
I have learned it, but I go a notch 
higher, I know positively that I do 
know the truth of some of these 
principles we have received. I 
know that the principle of faith in 
God. in Jesus Christ, and in the 
Spirit of the Lord, and the Holy 
Ghost, is a correct principle. I know 
that the principle of repentance 
is a true principle, and I know that 
I know it, too. I know that bap- 
tism by immersion for the remission 
of sins, by one having authority, 
is a true principle, because Christ 
taught it ; Christ obeyed it, and 
would not fail, for anything, to ful- 



fil it — not that He was sinful and 
needed to be baptized for the remis- 
sion of sins, but He only needed 
to do it to fulfill all righteousness, 
that is, to fulfil the law. I know 
that that is a true principle. I know 
that it is a true and righteous prin- 
ciple to keep one's self pure and 
unspotted from the world, and I 
know that I know it, too. I know 
that it is just and true that men 
should not steal, nor lie, nor commit 
adultery, nor bear false witness 
against their neighbor, nor do any- 
thing like unto it. I know that 
these are true principles, and 
1 thank God, that I do know it, and 
that it is in my heart to observe 
and keep these things. I know, too, 
that it is a proper thing for us to 
accept and honor the Holy Priest- 
hood that has been restored to the 
earth in this dispensation, through 
Joseph the Prophet. I know that 
is good, because it is calculated to 
uphold the truth, and sustain the 
Church, and develop men in knowl- 
edge, in good works, in fidelity to 
the purposes of the Lord, and it is 
essential to the proper government 
of the people of God in the earth, 
and for our own individual govern- 
ment, the government of our fam- 
ilies, the government of our tem- 
poral and spiritual affairs, individ- 
ually as well as collectively. I be- 
lieve that every individual in the 
Church has just as much right to 
enjoy the spirit of revelation and 
the understanding from God which 
that spirit of revelation gives him, 
for his own good, as the Bishop has 
to enable him to preside over his 
ward. Every man has the privlege 
to exercise these gifts and these 
privileges in the conduct of his own 
affairs, in bringing up his children 
in the way they should go, and in 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the management of his farm, his 
flocks, his herds, and in the manage- 
ment of his business, if he has busi- 
ness of other kinds to do; it is his 
right to enjoy the spirit of revela- 
tion and of inspiration to do the 
right thing, to be wise and prudent, 
just, and good in everything that he 
does. I know that this is a true prin- 
ciple, and I know that I know it, 
too ; and that is the thing that I 
would like the Latter-day Saints to 
know. 

And I know this, that God has 
organized His Church in the earth ; 
and I know that when He designs 
or purposes to make any change in 
the manner or matter of governing 
or controlling or presiding over the 
affairs of His Church, that He will 
make the change, and He will make 
it in such a way that the whole 
people of the Church, who are doing 
right, will understand and accept it. 
I know that the Lord will not raise 
up "Tom, Dick, or Harry," here, 
there and everywhere claiming to be 
Christ, or "one mighty and strong," 
claiming to be inspired and called 
to do some wonderful thing. The 
Lord will not deal with men in that 
way ; that while organization of the 
Church exists, while quorums and 
councils of the Priesthood are intact 
in the Church, the Lord will reveal 
His purposes through them and not 
through "Tom, Dick, or Harry." 
Put that in your little "note books" 
now, and remember it ; it is true. 

Now, the Lord bless you. God 
bless this people. My heart is filled 
with love and gratitude to God, 
and with love and blessings for the 
Latter-day Saints, from every part 
of the land, and everywhere. I 



pray that God's blessing may rest 
down mightily upon you, and that 
you may prosper in all your efforts 
for good, and in every lawful busi- 
ness in which you are concerned, 
as individuals and as communities, 
that you may live in harmony, in 
peace and good-will, that you may 
be generous toward the erring. Try 
to save men and not destroy them. 
Set an example before the world, 
that they cannot gainsay, and so that 
they cannot condemn you for your 
conduct or acts ; and if they con- 
demn you at all, that they will have 
to conjure up something that is not 
true and then fight it, as the pre- 
judiced world is doing in relation 
to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

There are our Elders over in 
Great Britain meeting with bitter 
opposition ; and here in our own 
land are falsehoods being circulated 
of the most infamous character, and 
by the most keen subtle and cunning 
processes that ever were known to 
man, intended to destroy the influ- 
ence of this people, but error, and 
falsehood will fail. And "truth is 
mighty and will prevail," therefore, 
we can afford to wait. Let the evil 
one exhaust his efforts, and do his 
worst ; and the Lord will overrule 
it, in the end for the good of His 
cause, and for the discomfiture of 
His enemies ; which may God grant, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The favorite hymn, "Oh, my 
Father," translated into the Spanish 
language by Sister Samantha B. 
De Foley, was sweetly sung by Sis- 
ter Amelia Margetts.

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Prayer should include thanks for bless- 
ings received, and supplication only 
for what is needed — Purpose of the 
Sacrament should always be remem- 
bered — Love and devotion best ex- 
press gratitude for the Atonement — 
The Redeemer the great Examplar of 
forgiving. 

In presenting myself before you, 
I ask an interest in your faith and 
prayers. I have enjoyed the re- 
marks of our President, and know 
you all have, and I was pleased to 
hear the testimony that he was able 
to bear in regard to us as a people. 
I don't believe that we are retro- 
grading, or losing our spirituality. 
I believe the Latter-day Saints are 
growing and progressing, and that 
they love the truth which they have 
received in the Gospel. The Latter- 
day Saints have reason to be more 
thankful than any other people on 
the earth, for what the Lord has 
done for them. 

We ought to show in our every 
day lives a deep devotion to the 
principles of the Gospel, and to our 
Heavenly Father. It should not be 
merely in words and expressions, 
but it should pervade our whole 
being. When awake in the morn- 
ing, our thoughts should be directed 
to the Author of our being, with 
thanks, for the protection during 
the night, and with a prayer for His 
guidance and protection during the 
day ; and, when we lie down at 
night, our last thoughts should be 
directed to Him, thanking Him for 
what we have been able to do dur- 
ing the day, and communing with 
Him in our meditations. Our devo- 
tion should be shown in calling to- 
gether our family at the family al- 
tar, in the morning and at night, 
and there bring before the Lord our 



petitions and supplications. The 
President told us not to use super- 
fluous words, not to pray for that 
which we have, but rather give 
thanks for it, and pray for that 
which we need. In going to our 
Heavenly Father in prayer, let us go 
as children to their Father, know- 
ing that He loves us, and is willing 
and able to bestow upon us that 
which is necessary for us to receive. 
Let our prayers ascend in faith, not 
as an experiment, not in words 
spoken by rote, but let our words 
be the heartfelt supplications for 
that which we stand in need of, and 
desire to receive ; and if our prayers 
be answered, let us not forget to 
thank the Giver, if the things 
which we so much desire are with- 
held from us, let us not feel in our 
hearts that God does not hear pray- 
ers, or answer them. We desire 
not things that would be an injury 
to us. He understands us and 
knows what would aid and assist 
us, and in His wisdom He often 
withholds from us that which we 
earnestly desire. I believe most of 
us have found that at times we have 
asked for things which, if they had 
been granted, would not have been 
a blessing to us, therefore we ought 
to follow the example of our be- 
loved. Savior in the Garden of Geth- 
semane. 

It is Good Friday today. This is 
celebrated by the Christian world 
in commemoration of the suffer- 
ings of our Savior. Eighteen hun- 
dred and seventy-nine years ago last 
night, He spent some time in the 
Garden of Gethsemane. You know 
how He suffered, in contemplating 
that which was before Him, the bit- 
ter cup that He was to drain. He 
asked His Father: "If thou be 
willing, remove this cup from me; 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nevertheless, not My will, but Thine 
be done." Now, this is what we all 
should feel to say. Today, Good 
Friday, the day on which He suffer- 
ed so much for us, let us not forget 
to let our thoughts go to Him in 
thankfulness. 

Every Sunday the Latter-day 
Saints meet in their houses of wor- 
ship, they partake of the Sacrament, 
and there covenant with the Lord to 
take upon them the name of His 
Son, and that they will always re- 
member Him, and keep His Com- 
mandments. Let these covenants 
be made in earnest ; covenants 
meant to be kept, not just while we 
are partaking of the emblems of 
His body and blood sacrificed for 
us, but all through our lives. Day 
by day we should remember Him 
and show our love for Him in doing 
His will as He has shown His great 
love for us in giving His life to 
atone for the whole human family. 
What greater love could any one 
have than to give his life for his 
brethren ? He did so ; He brought 
about the atonement and bought 
us back unto our Heavenly Father. 
He carried out the plan that was 
laid before the world was. It was 
not a happen-so or chance work. 

The Lord, when He prepared this 
world for us, saw that it was -neces- 
sary for His children to become ac- 
quainted with good and evil. We 
knew only that which was good in 
that former world where we lived 
near Him, as was sang in the hymn 
to which we have just listened. We 
had not experienced that which was 
evil. We were not able to have 
joy because we had known no sor- 
row. This earth was prepared for 
us ; this was the school we had to 
pass through ; and the Lord, see- 
ing what would take place, pre- 



pared the Lamb, ''slain from the 
foundation of the world" to atone 
for men, and regain all that was 
lost in the Fall. Jesus accepted 
of this mission. The sacrifice that 
was to be made for the human 
family could only be made by one 
who had not sinned Himself. It 
would have to be done by One who 
voluntarily offered to do this, in 
order that justice might be satis- 
fied and mercy be extended to the 
sinner. We learn in the revelations 
of the Lord that the fall extended 
to all, and that the grievous conse- 
quence of the fall was banishment 
from the presence of our Heavenly 
Father. The consequences of the 
fall were both temporal and spirit- 
ual. Jesus came ; He made the sacri- 
fice. He did it willingly. He was 
without blemish or fault. No sin 
was found in Him. and as such He 
was a proper subject for the sacri- 
fice. We should always remember 
Him, keep His commandments, love 
one another, and then we can claim 
that we love Him and the Father. 
That love should pervade our very 
being, and then it is easy to serve 
Him. The temptations and trials 
that may come to us, are more 
easily overcome and borne if we 
have His love in our hearts and His 
spirit with us. 

Crucifixion was one of the most 
exquisite tortures that the Roman 
mind had devised. What an exam- 
ple He gave us while upon the 
cross, suffering as He did, He still 
could say: "Father forgive them; 
they know not what they do !" Can 
we^follow His example and feel that 
way towards our enemies? He 
showed Himself, in that very thing, 
to be above His fellows. It is God- 
like to forgive ; it is human-like to 
want revenge. We are quick to 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



13 



want to revenge ourselves when we 
are wronged; and there can be no 
greater wrong done than when an 
innocent person is put to death. Yet 
He could, with all the earnestness 
of His soul, pray for His brethren, 
those erring ones who had gone so 
far as to take His life, and ask the 
Lord to forgive them, for they knew 
not what they did. The great mul- 
titude, no doubt, was in that con- 
dition, but there were others who 
knew better — the guilty ones to 
whom Peter said : "Repent ye, 
therefore, and be converted, that 
your sins may be blotted out, when 
the times of refreshing shall come 
from the presence of the Lord." 

The Sunday before, when He 
came to Jerusalem from Bethany, 
the populace had met Him, and 
hailed Him as the King of Israel, 
the Son of David, and made a great 
uproar in the streets, — and now, five 
days afterwards, they took part in 
the cry: "Crucify Him!" But re- 
member the forgiving heart of the 
Savior, how He could endure His 
trial and suffering, and yet ask the 
Father to forgive tliem. 

Now, when anyone offends us, 
brethren and sisters, let us remem- 
ber the example given us. let us 
not take offense at every little thing 
that may appear offensive to us, for 
in the great majority of cases, when 
we investigate the matter, we find 
that no intentional offense was 
meant, but only thoughtlessness was 
the cause. Often, we do not try to 
examine into it ; we take it as an 
affront, and forget the advice given 
us that if we have ought against 
our brother, we should go to him 
and make it right. Let us, the 
Lord's family here upon the earth, 
brothers and sisters, not forget to 
show brotherly kindness and love 



one another. If we do not do so, 
we cannot expect the love of our 
Heavenly Father. If we are not 
willing to forgive one another our 
offenses, we cannot ask Him to for- 
give us our offenses. In the prayer 
that Jesus taught us, He gave the 
condition upon which we could ob- 
tain forgiveness, namely, by asking 
the Lord to "forgive us our debts 
as we forgive our debtors." We 
must cultivate this feeling. We must 
live in harmony with one another, 
and unitedly take hold of building 
up the kingdom of God upon the 
earth. 

How thankful we ought to be 
that God has given us the testimony 
of the truth, that we know that 
Jesus is our Redeemer, that we 
know that His Gospel has been re- 
stored to earth, and that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God. I 
thank Him for this knowledge I 
have received, and I know that all 
Latter-day Saints feel to give 
thanks to the Lord for it. Now, 
let us show in our everv-day work 
that we are thankful to the Lord, 
and willing to keep His com- 
mandments and do what He has 
asked us to do. God bless all. Amen. 

President Joseph F. Smith made 
announcements, including a notice 
that members of the Church attend- 
ing Conference, who need lodgings, 
or board, can receive entertainment 
by applying' to the committee acting 
under direction of the Presidents of 
Salt Lake City Stakes. 

The choir sang the Anthem 
"Jesus, I my cross have taken." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Richard W. Young. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p.

AFTERNOON SESSION, 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Da- 
vid H. Cannon. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O, say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem. 

That the riches of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of Truth will be, 
when

Is counted but dross and refuse 



PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

The Power of Truth — The Testimony 
of the Spirit — A Divine Message — Lib- 
erty of Thought and Speech — Opposi- 
tion overruled for good — Order in 
Revelation — Difference in Seeing the 
Right and doing It. Every Saint to Do 
His Duty. 

I feel that we are highly priv- 
ileged in being permitted to assem- 
ble on this occasion to worship the 
Lord, and to engage in the duties 
of this conference. I was greatly 
pleased this morning with the 
meeting that we held ; to see so large 
a congregation, notwithstanding the 
condition of the weather, and it be- 
ing the first meeting of the confer- 
ence, to see this house well filled 
and to notice the attention of the 
congregation, and the spirit in 



which they appeared to receive the 
instructions which were imparted. 
There was a splendid influence here. 
I am sure that we all felt the unity 
of the faith and enjoyed the impres- 
sions of the Holy Spirit while our 
brethren were instructing us. The 
powerful testimony that was borne 
by President Joseph F. Smith found 
a full echo in my heart, and I be- 
lieve it did in the hearts of all who 
were assembled. It is a great thing 
to know that we are engaged in the 
work of God, to be certain of it, to 
have no doubt about it in our minds, 
and feel it in every part of our na- 
ture, to have it stamped upon our 
being. To know this by the inspira- 
tion that comes from on high, by 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, con- 
ferred upon us in the way that the 
Lord has appointed- — by the laying 
on of the hands of His servants, 
after we had received, in faith and 
in repentance, the ordinance of bap- 
tism for the remission of sins. We 
are all on a level in this respect, no 
matter of what race or nation we 
may have come. We are all bap- 
tized with the same baptism, and 
have received of the same spirit, 
and according to our diligence in 
searching after truth, it will be 
made manifest to us. 

As we have just sung, Truth is 
priceless ; it is the beginning and 
the end of all things : it is "the sum 
of existence." We are in a posi- 
tion to receive truth day by day and 
year by year, that we may "grow in 
grace and in the knowledge of the 
truth." It is a little surprising, how- 
ever, to find sometimes a few of 
those who have received the Gospel 
and have had the witness of the 
Holy Spirit, and have borne testi- 
mony many times to this fact, al- 
lowing themselves to be drawn aside 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

to the right or the left, and getting 
their minds enshrouded in dark- 
ness instead of walking in the light. 
But I am glad to say that such per- 
sons are but few and far between, 
and the great body of the Church 
is in unity in doctrine and principle 
and in recognizing the organization 
that our Heavenly Father has es- 
tablished for the government of the 
Church, for its perpetuation, for its 
extension in all the world, so that 
it may continue and abide and may 
not be taken away again from the 
earth, I was very glad to hear 
what the President said this morn- 
ing, looking along this line, that 
the Church was never in a better 
condition than it is in at the present 
day, that the Saints generally are 
striving to keep the commandments 
of God, that they are endeavoring to 
walk in the way of life and light 
and truth, that the Church in every 
respect, not only spiritually but tem- 
porally, financially and in every 
other way, is in a flourishing con- 
dition, and this in spite of all that' 
has been done against it, to ob- 
struct it, to hinder its advancement. 

There has been an effort from 
the very commencement, on the part 
of the powers of evil, to prevent the 
progress of this work, and it has 
gone so far as endeavors to crush 
out the lives of our leaders. The 
spirit that has brought that about 
still exists in the world and will 
until it is entirely overcome by the 
power of light and truth, and the 
Spirit of the Lord poured out upon 
the nations. This is one strong evi- 
dence of the divinity of the work in 
which we are engaged — I mean the 
turmoil that it excites in the world, 
the opposition which it meets from 
the various denominations of re- 
ligion, Christian and Pagan. The 



numerous _ errors that exist in the 
world and the divisions which have 
been in the world for many cen- 
turies, continue to increase. Not 
only are there sects multiplied upon 
sects, but in and among themselves 
each sect has its own divisions and 
strifes, so that there is no real unity 
in the different organizations of re- 
ligion in the world. Now, if our 
faith, if our Church — (I call it "our 
Church" because we have made it 
ours by accepting the Church of the 
Lord. It is, indeed, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and we have accepted it and have 
been baptized into it and have be- 
come part of it, and it is a part of 
us. I feel in all my being, that I 
have a part in it, and it has a part 
in me. I belong to it and it be- 
longs to me, so I say our Church;) 
if our Church were to move 
among the various different sects 
and parties in the world, and be- 
come harmonious with them, even 
as much as they are harmonious 
with each other — which is not very 
much, — if that were the case, why 
we would become one of them ; that 
is all. 

But there is something distinct 
and different altogether in the 
Church to which we belong, from 
other organizations in 'the world. 
We do not wish to interfere with 
them. We do not wish to block 
the way to the dissemination of 
their views and ideas and doctrines, 
because we believe in the great prin- 
ciple of free agency which our 
Father recognizes, and with which 
He does not interfere — the right of 
every individual to accept that 
which appears right in his own 
eyes, and as far as he has legitimate 
power, to endeavor to extend that 
among others, to bring others to see 



A 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as he sees ; we believe that we 
should recognize the right of all 
people to their own views and 
opinions on such matters. So we 
do not wish to interfere with them 
in the least degree, but we want 
the same freedom that we accord to 
them. We want to have the liberty, 
in proper ways, without interfering 
with others, to proclaim our faith, 
to bear our testimony, to carry our 
message ; for we have a message — 
this whole people, the Latter-day 
Saints — we have a message, and it 
is to all the world, to every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and peo- 
ple ; and that message has come 
down from on high. It is from 
God, through Jesus Christ our Re- 
deemer, and has been brought here 
by angelic messengers. And the 
authority and power to proclaim 
this Gospel in the name of Deity 
has been given to this Church, the 
authority to administer in the ordi- 
nances of the Gospel, so that they 
will be accepted on high — so that 
what is loosed on earth, by this 
authority, will be loosed in heaven; 
and that which is sealed or bound 
on earth, by it, will be recognized 
in heaven, will be valid, and will 
be looked upon as being the same as 
if administered in person by the 
Divine powers above. Now we 
want to have the liberty to carry 
this message to all the world ; and 
we intend to struggle for it. We 
do not expect to take up carnal 
weapons. The Lord has promised 
that He will fight our battles, so far 
as they are concerned, but we have 
to stand up for the truth as we un- 
derstand it, as it has come into our 
souls and has become part of our na- 
ture. 

We want to carry this to all the 
world and proclaim it to all na- 



tions because this is a mission which 
the Lord has given to us. We in 
our first estate as spirits, the sons 
and daughters of the Eternal Father, 
have been chosen and selected to 
come down on the earth in these lat- 
ter days, so that we may engage 
in this work. This is what we are 
here for. While we are endeavoring 
as far as we can to provide for 
ourselves those things that are nec- 
essary for the good of the body, 
and for its continuation in health 
and vigor, and to surround our- 
selves with all the creature com- 
forts that can be produced from 
the elements ; yet, at the same time, 
we have this important mission be- 
fore us, and it is of primary im- 
portance to us ; it is the first thing 
with us ; it is the Kingdom of God 
and the righteousness of God that 
we place before all earthly 
things. We have come here 
for this express purpose, and 
this is our mission in the 
world ; and we want the privilege, 
because we consider it to be our 
right, to carry this work forward 
in freedom and without let or hind- 
rance in all the world. 

We expect to meet with opposi- 
tion. We expect that the people of 
the world will differ from us in our 
views in these matters, but we 
would like the privilege of compar- 
ing our views with theirs, compar- 
ing our doctrines with theirs, com- 
paring the ordinances of our Church 
with those they have, comparing the 
order of that which we call the 
Priesthood, i. e., divine authority, 
comparing the order that has been 
established in this Church by revela- 
tion from God, with the various or- 
ders of so-called priesthood or au- 
thority to be found among the na- 
tions — and to do this in the right

kind of spirit, in the spirit of kind- 
ness. Not that we want to make a 
tumult, not that we want to bring 
war upon us, but we would like the 
privilege, freely and without let or 
hindrance, to compare our doctrines 
and Priesthood, that have come 
from on high, with those various 
notions and opinions and orders and 
ordinances and organizations of the 
world. And then we are perfectly 
sure the honest in heart, those that 
really want the Truth, those that 
love right and justice and mercy 
and are looking after eternal things, 
will be glad to accept this glorious 
latter-day work which we desire to 
establish in the earth. But we may 
expect that there will be a great 
deal of animosity exhibited against 
us by the people of the world ; so 
we need not be surprised when we 
hear of mobs, whether they be 
raised in England or in other parts 
of the British Isles, or upon the 
continent of Europe, or even in the 
United States, in the land of free- 
dom, in the land which is expressly 
consecrated and devoted to liberty. 
We have had to meet with this kind 
of opposition even in the United 
States. And it is here on this soil 
that the blood of the prophets has 
been shed, who did no harm to any 
one, but who brought the eternal 
truth of God from Heaven, to pro- 
claim it to the world. And it was 
the truth which they had to deliver 
to the people that aroused and en- 
raged so-called Christians who were 
in opposition to them. Well, this is 
very lamentable, but something of 
this kind will continue until the tide 
shall be turned, and the preponder- 
ance in the world of the influences 
that exist will be on the side of 
right, of liberty, of truth, and of 
justice, and mercy, and kindness, 



the spirit or desire <o arrive at that 
which is true, and to live it; for 
it is one thing to learn the truth, 
and another thing to live by it. 

There is a great deal of light in 
the world in regard to many things 
that are not practiced. There is 
much admiration of virtue exhibited 
in the writings of both men and 
women. Even in those works that 
are called novels, virtue is lifted 
up and vice is frowned upon ; and, 
generally speaking, in the stories 
that are written, virtue becomes 
triumphant at the last. Yet the very 
people who read these predictions, 
and some of those who write them, 
are corrupt in their hearts, and do 
not practice that which they teach, 
or which they pretend to admire. 
So there is a great deal of actual 
evil and wickedness in the world, 
although there seems to be a very 
general perception of what is right 
when it is placed before mankind. 
Now, as I have said, it is one thing 
to learn the truth and another thing 
to live by it ; and we Latter-day 
Saints should set an example in this 
before all mankind, for we are not 
only to be teachers but exemplars 
of the principles of righteousness. 
We are to establish righteousness 
in the earth, and to be the instru- 
ments in the hands of God of es- 
tablishing righteous government. 
Not that we have any warfare with 
this government, or with any of the 
governments of the world ; they are 
in the hands of the great Eternal 
Father, and in due time He will 
turn and overturn and establish His 
own purposes and His own govern- 
ment on the face of the earth. We 
are the preparers of the way for the 
establishment of the Kingdom of 
our God. We are preaching "the 
Gospel of the kingdom," the Gos-

pel which, if it is received by the 
people, will bring them to works 
of righteousness as well as to be 
believers in righteousness. Now, my 
brethren and sisters, we should takt 
this into our minds, into our souls, 
that we are not only to be teachers 
of the word of the Lord, but we are 
to live the things that we have re- 
ceived and which we desire other 
people to understand. 

This Church to which we belong 
has been organized in all its va- 
roius departments for the purpose 
of leading people in trie right way, 
the way of truth, the way of the 
Lord, that we may be keepers of His 
commandments ; "not teachers of 
the word alone, but doers 
of it too." And the Lord 
has organized His Church in 
such a way that we have, all the 
time, some one to give us instruc- 
tions, directions, precepts, sugges- 
tions, commandments. Not that any 
force is used in this Church to com- 
pel people to do right or to refrain 
from doing wrong. Full liberty is 
given to every soul in this Church 
to pursue such course as he or she 
may please to take. But at the 
same time, there is an opportunity 
open for every one to do what is 
right, individually and with a view 
to the good of the whole community. 
Because, although we must work 
out our individual salvation, yet we 
are so connected in this Church, 
by being members of the same body, 
that what we do or leave undone has 
its effect upon those with whom we 
are associated. We are united in 
a splendid organism, conceded by 
many people who have examined it, 
but do not believe in its divinity, 
as the finest organization in the 
world. We are in unison with them 
in that view. It is complete and 



perfect, because it is divine; it has 
not emanated simply from the mind 
and brain of men. It has come from 
God out of heaven. It has come 
down on the earth to stay here and 
to accomplish the divine purpose 
foreseen by all the prophets of old. 
It is the beginning of that great 
kingdom about which the prophets 
of old wrote, and the seers and 
sages and poets of old sang and re- 
joiced over. We are in the Church 
of the living God. It is the begin- 
ning of that kingdom that is to 
come. Spiritually it is the Kingdom 
of God, and by and by all things 
predicted concerning God's govern- 
ment on the earth will be fulfilled, 
when all nations shall bow in obedi- 
ence to Him, when they shall cease 
their wars, and turn their spears 
into pruning hooks and their swords 
into plow-shares, (using the figura- 
tive expressions of ancient writers), 
when all this will be fulfilled and the 
kingdoms of this world will become 
the kingdom of our God and His 
Christ, and He shall rule and 
reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusa- 
lem, and before His ancients, glori- 
ously, as the prophets predicted. 
This is to be a kingdom of rigteous- 
ness, a kingdom of truth, a 
kingdom of equity, of kindness, of 
brotherly love and of unity, a 
kingdom and organization in which 
the utmost fraternity will prevail. 
Men and women will be brothers 
and sisters in very deed, God will 
be our Father, and all mankind 
our brethren. We believe in the 
Fatherhood of God and the broth- 
erhod of man. This spirit must 
prevail in the midst of the Latter- 
day Saints, or we shall not be able 
to accomplish the work that has 
been assigned to us. But it will be 
done, for God will raise up others 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

and fill our places if we do not take 
this course ourselves. 

Now, we are here in conference 
assembled that we may confer with 
each other to know what there is 
to do in the great work which the 
Lord has committed to us. Let us 
turn our attention to ourselves, in- 
dividually, and to the immediate as- 
sociations and organizations, and 
quorums, and societies to which we 
belong, and ask ourselves the ques- 
tion whether we are doing our duty ; 
whether we are living for the 
truth ; whether we are desiring to 
establish notions and ideas of our 
own, that we may gain applause, 
that we may gain the good-will of 
men, or whether we are conform- 
ing ourselves to the principles and 
precepts, and the order and doc- 
trines, and everything pertaining to 
our standing in the Church that 
has been set up by the authority 
of God, in the way that He has ap- 
pointed, through those whom He 
nas placed over us, in our respective 
wards, and stakes, . and in . the 
Church at large. Have we done our 
duty in the past? If not, let us 
make up our minds today that 
henceforth we will do that, in the 
present and in the future, and will 
make it first and foremost in our 
thoughts, and in our lives, and in 
our doings, in all our business af- 
fairs, and in everything in which we 
are engaged ; that we will have our 
eyes fixed, primarily, upon the 
building up of the Church and 
Kingdom of God and the accom- 
plishment of His divine purposes 
in relation to the children of men. 
We all belong to some special 
•organization. If we are in the 
Priesthood we belong to an organi- 
zation called a quorum; if we are 
not in the Priesthood, and some- 



times if we are, we belong to some 
of these auxiliary societies that 
have been established — the Sunday 
Schools, the Relief Societies, the 
Young Men's and Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement Associations, 
the Religion Classes, and the Pri- 
mary Associations, and so forth. 
All these have been established in 
the Church as aids, to keep us in the 
right way and to engage our atten- 
tion, to enlist our energies, to con- 
firm us in the faith, and bring us 
nearer and nearer to Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer, our living head ; that 
we may receive of the blessings that 
flow from His presence, and be 
baptized really and truly unto Him, 
that we may be one with Him. 

Now, if we have neglected our 
duties in any respect, in regard to 
our associations together, or in our 
home circle, in the influence that we 
should carry with our families, to 
lead them aright ; if we have failed 
at all in the past, let us not do so 
in the future. That principle of re- 
pentance — the turning away from 
wrong, and doing right — will always 
exist while there is anything to 
amend, to repent of. So there is 
room for all of us to amend and 
to repent of anything that is wrong 
about us, in relation to the past, 
and to determine In this confer- 
ence that henceforth we will devote 
our energies, our faith, our 
strength, the means that God has 
blest us with, to build up His King- 
dom, to send the Gospel to the 
nations of the earth, to gather in 
the upright in heart, to build up 
the stakes of Zion, to build up the 
wards thereof, to establish places 
of worship, to enter therein and 
worship the Lord, together, in the 
beauty of holiness, to attend to all 
the ordinances that pertain to the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church of Christ, and obtain the 
spirit thereof, and to help build up 

the societies, and associations, and 
organizations of the Church wheth- 
er they are auxiliary or belong to 
the Priesthood, that we will do our 
duty in these respects. There are, 
I have no doubt, today in this con- 
gregation, Elders who do not attend 
the. meetings of their respective 
quorums. I have no doubt there are 
Seventies who do not care much 
about sending or carrying the Gos- 
pel to foreign nations. There are 
High Priests, no doubt, who are 
getting along in years, and so they 
do not gather with their brethren 
in their quorum meetings. And so 
with others. There may be, among 
all of us, some dereliction in these 
respects. Now, brethren and sis- 
ters, let us take upon ourselves to- 
day the spirit and power of our 
calling and our mission, and go 
from this conference determined 
that by the help of God we will neg- 
lect nothing that we ought to attend 
to ; that we will do nothing, wil- 
fully, that is wicked, or evil, or 
contrary to the commandments of 
God, and that we will promote peace 
and union and righteousness and 
brotherly love among those with 
whom we are associated or by 
whom we are surrounded. 

Let us not introduce anything 
that will cause schism in the body 
or bring about division. "Mark 
them," the apostle of old said, 
"that make divisions among you." 
Do not attempt to do anything of 
that kind. There is no bondage 
upon the servants of the Lord or the 
handmaidens of the Lord in regard 
to free thought, to a full under- 
standing of that which comes to 
their attention ; but there is no man 
in our midst who has a right to in- 



troduce anything contrary to or 
different from the revelations of 
God that have been recorded, or by 
way of commandment, except the 
man that stands at the head, and 
that is necessary for the order of 
the Church, for its unity and its 
strength, and its power in the earth. 
As the President told us this morn- 
ing, and as we understand, the 
spirit of revelation is free to every 
man and woman in the Church who 
has been baptized and confirmed by 
the laying on of hands. That is a 
special blessing and gift — the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of 
truth that guides into all truth, 
that takes of the things of the 
Father and of the Son, the things 
of eternity and reveals them unto 
mortals. We have the right to that 
spirit ; but there are false spirits 
coming out in the world now as 
there were of old and let us be care- 
ful that we are not led away by 
them. Let us take that good spirit 
for our guide and also be guided 
by the rules and regulations and 
order established in the Church by 
revelation from God ; and though 
we may all have the right to re- 
ceive revelations from on high for 
ourselves, to govern our conduct, 
to regulate us in the family relation 
or in any capacity we are called 
upon to act in the Church, yet 
there is but one man at a time, ac- 
cording to God's direct word, who 
receives revelations for the govern- 
ment of the Church and to regulate 
matters pertaining to its doctrines 
and ordinances. The Lord told us 
in the very beginning that we were 
not to receive revelations of any 
who came among us except His 
servant who stood at the head, and 
if he transgressed, the Lord would 
remove him, and somebody else 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



21 



would occupy his place. That is in 
accordance with the order of 
heaven. "My house is a house of 
order," said the Lord, "and not a 
house of confusion." As the Presi- 
dent said this morning, if every 
Tom, Dick and Harry can start up 
and give a revelation, and pretend 
to have this and that authority and 
power and so forth, and people are 
led off by such individuals, there 
will be confusion worse confounded, 
and the order of the Church be 
disturbed if not obliterated. Now, 
the Lord has placed a man at the 
head to receive revelations for the 
Church, to stand at the head and 
regulate those affairs ; and asso- 
ciated with his counselors and the 
Twelve and other orders of the 
Priesthood who take counsel togeth- 
er, everything can be regulated and 
placed in the proper order, and if 
there is anything which the Church 
is to receive as doctrine or for 
guidance in its discipline and or- 
der, it will come in the legitimate 
way through the head. Let every 
man, and every woman, and every 
boy, and girl, who is a member of 
the Church, seek constantly for the 
spirit of revelation, the Holy Spirit, 
the Comforter, the revealer, the 
manifestor of that which is right 
and true. By the influence of that 
spirit we can be guided aright, and 
we can be inspired to right action, 
strengthened against evil, fortified 
against sin, imbued with light and 
truth and that good spirit which 
comes from above. 

I was pleased to hear the remarks 
of President Lund in regard to this 
anniversary today, supposed to be 
the anniversary of the day when our 
Lord was lifted up on the cross. 
He was "despised and rejected of 
men, and was a man of sorrows and 



acquainted with grief," and yet He 
was the Lord of life, and glory, and 
came here to die for us, to save us 
from our sins and the consequences 
thereof, to open the way whereby 
we could go back into the presence 
of the Father. He lived and died 
for us, yet notwithstanding that, 
when He came to His own, His own 
received Him not, but all kinds of 
ignominies were piled upon Him, 
and finally they inflicted upon Him 
the most cruel death that they knew 
anything about ; and the people who 
strewed palm branches in His way, 
when He entered into Jerusalem, 
exclaimed, "Blessed is He that 
cometh in the name of the Lord," 
only about five days later cried out, 
"Away with Him, crucify Him ; He 
is not fit to live." And if the Lord 
of life and glory endured what He 
had to bear in bringing light and 
truth into the world for the salva- 
tion of mankind was treated in that 
manner, how can we expect, as His 
servants, to be treated much differ- 
ently even in this enlightened twen- 
tieth century ! 

Well, we will endeavor to bear 
the ills that we have to meet and we 
will try to endure with patience the 
opposition that is raised against us, 
knowing for a certainty that the 
Lord will overrule it all for good, 
that every weapon that is formed 
against us will eventually fall to the 
ground and we remain unharmed ; 
and the very efforts that are being 
made in various pans to arouse the 
populace against us to do us harm, 
to speak evil against us, to say 
things that are untrue concerning 
us and our principles and designs, 
and every means so employed will, 
in the hands of the Lord, be turned 
around to sustain tne good and up- 
right and truth-loving throughout 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the world. The Gospel of Jesus 
Christ will spread abroad, and that 
which is called "Mormonism" will 
increase and go forth in power and 
in strength, and everything pre- 
dicted concerning it by the prophets 
of God will come to pass. Now let 
us do our part in forwarding this 
great work, and in that we shall 
have joy and satisfaction and the 
peace that passeth all understand- 
ing, the knowledge of God, the tes- 
timony of Jesus, and the power of 
the Almighty to be with us in pub- 
lic and in private, and by His 
strength we will prevail, and the 
kingdoms of this world will become 
the kingdom of our God and His 
Christ ; and He will come and rule 
<and reign over all. Blessed are 
they that labor in His cause, for 
they shall be crowned with glory in 
His presence. God help us to do 
our duty in all respects — through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Knowledge of God imparted by the Holy- 
Ghost — Divine mission assigned to all 
members of the Church— Great and 
good people will be converted by the 
Lord, and join His Church — Prayer 
a duty and necessity of all Saints — 
Obligation for each to minister for 
benefit of all. 

I pray that the same good spirit 
may assist me, the little time I un- 
dertake to talk to you, that was en- 
joyed by my brethren. It appears 
that the good Spirit of the Lord 
has been with us, generously, and 
that we have been instructed and 
exhorted very fervently, and that 



we have been commended before 
the Lord for our good works and 
the success that has attended upon 
our ministry; for the brethren feel 
that the Church is in good condition, 
progressing, and that we are as 
faithful, if not more faithful, than 
we have been before. I believe that 
that testimony is true of those who 
are gathered here today and of 
those who are at home and could 
not be with us. We can't all come 
to Conference at one time. It is 
very difficult, at all times, for some 
people to make it convenient so that 
they can attend upon our General 
Conferences, and our stake confer- 
ences, and ward conferences, and 
mission conferences ; but there is 
always a good strong representation 
of choice men and women who have 
been trained a long time in the Gos- 
pel, and who love the truth, love 
righteousness, and have a testi- 
mony in their hearts in regard to 
the truth, that they have found out 
the way of life, have found out the 
commandments of the Lord and 
are living those commandments 
pretty well, with ample room, no 
doubt, for improvement. 

We are a peculiar people. I 
thought the President was rather 
impressing upon us, this morning, 
the features that emphasize our 
peculiarities. We are gathered to- 
gether as religious people, general- 
ly, do not gather. We come from 
everywhere. Wherever the Gospel 
has been preached the people gath- 
er to the land of Zion ; and we be- 
come neighbors, we become kindred 
and friends. We fellowship togeth- 
er, and we have one spirit. Though 
we talk different languages, yet we 
have one spirit, the Spirit of the 
Lord that is conferred upon us, in 
a goodly measure and in a degree 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

corresponding with our devotion 
and faithfulness, and of our repent- 
ance and works of righteousness. 
This is my testimony, in connection 
with my brethren, having traveled 
among the people for some years, 
and being pretty well acquainted 
with the brethren, particularly, who 
bear the Priesthood ; and nearly all 
the male members of the Church 
are entrusted with divine authority, 
and speak of the divinity of the Sa- 
vior — and the divinity of the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph, the di- 
vinity of this work the divini- 
ty of the Scriptures — the Jewish 
and Nephite Scriptures — and the di- 
vinity of the revelations given 
through the Prophet Joseph, our 
law-giver, the Lord's law-giver to 
us in this last dispensation particu- 
larly. I thought I was brought to 
this conclusion, in addition to what 
my brethren said, that your mission, 
our mission as members of the 
Church, as men bearing the Priest- 
hood, that our mission is also a di- 
vine mission — so beautifully touch- 
ed upon by the President, in re- 
gard to the Savior, and the princi- 
ple of revelation for every person 
who has faith in God, and in His 
Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy 
Ghost, and who repents of his sins, 
or her sins, is entitled, through gen- 
uine and proper baptism, to the re- 
mission of their sins, and to receive 
the baptism of fire and the Holy 
Ghost, that Spirit which bears rec- 
ord of the Father, and without 
which no man can know that God 
lives. They may believe, and they 
may have hope, but to have .positive 
knowledge of God and of His Son 
Jesus Christ, the Redeemer and Sa- 
vior of th e world, and a testi- 
mony in regard to the mission of 
the prophets and of Joseph Smith, 



the prophet of this dispensation, no 
man can have this knowledge ex- 
cept it be given him of the Father 
by the Holy Ghost. 

It is as much the right of every 
other memebr in this Church as it 
is your right and mine, my brethren 
who are presiding, bearing the 
Priesthood and authority in the 
Church; it is the right of every 
other member to have that same 
spirit and to have it in rich abun- 
dance, in proportion to our devo- 
tion and faithfulness, and to know 
that this Gospel is true. We can 
know it by the Holy Ghost ; we 
can know it is true ; we can know 
of the divinity of this work in which 
we are engaged ; we can know of 
the divinity of the lives and labors 
of the prophets that have gone be- 
fore, and the patriarchs, and those 
who have represented the Lord in 
His divine authority among the 
children of men. Every member is 
entitled to that witness and testi- 
mony. Our mission is divine, is of 
God ; we are called of Him, and He 
has converted us, and He has 
brought us to receive of the Spirit 
of Christ, to the remission of our 
sins ; that is what the Father has 
done. We, under His direction, 
have been preaching the Gospel, ex- 
pounding the Scriptures, advocating 
the truth and laying out the way of 
life and salvation to the children of 
men. But it is the Lord that has 
called you ; it is His inspiration, His 
Spirit that has converted you and 
brought you to feel trie truth, and 
to accept it, and to submit your- 
selves to it. It is the Lord that has 
brought you to repentance and 
reformation, and works of right- 
eousness. Men have not done it ; 
men cannot do it, cannot accom- 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



plish that mission ; the Lord has 
done it. 

I have been brought to realize, 
literally, that the Lord will be 
moving upon the children of men, 
and that He has already moved 
upon them and has enabled them 
to see the truth, and to see the 
Gospel, and to realize that there is 
truth in it, and power in it ; and 
men will be brought to inquire after 
the truth. They are so inquiring 
now, and they will continue to in- 
quire — great, and important, and re- 
markable men — and when His Spir- 
it is bestowed, when the Spirit of 
Christ, following the exercise of 
men's agency, opening their ears 
and listening to the truth, with a de- 
sire to know, and the Spirit of 
Christ takes possession of them, 
then are they entitled to come into 
His Church — to receive the ordi- 
nace of baptism in water, and the 
ordinance of baptism by the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. When this is brought 
about, they will become established 
as we are, my brethren and my sis- 
ters, as we feel today, as we are es- 
tablished and as we hold on to the 
truth and are willing to suffer, 
willing to endure, willing to labor 
for the Gospel and for the kingdom, 
for the salvation of the children of 
men and for our own salvation. 
People will come from afar and will 
enter into the fold, and will labor 
as we are laboring. The Lord will 
have to accomplish that. 

I have discovered that the work is 
too great for men to accomplish, 
and that the Lord will work among 
the peoples of the earth, and con- 
vert them, and bring them to see 
the truth. They will inquire after 
it, and when the Spirit of Christ 
takes possession of them, whether 



they be great and remarkable 
among the children of men or not, 
they will receive the truth and they 
will submit to it, and they will listen, 
and obey. They will not allow busi- 
ness, they will not allow the wealth 
of the word, they will not allow 
the honors and the greatness of 
this world to stand between them 
and God, whenever they have so 
far listened to the truth and dis- 
covered it that they realize and ap- 
preciate it, and receive of the Spirit 
of Christ, entitling them to the re- 
mission of sins. You will find that 
they will take hold of the Gospel, 
and they will stand for the truth, and 
as you are willing and have been 
willing to sacrifice what you have 
had, you will find the great men 
of the world will come to that point 
also ; and they will come to our de- 
fense and the help of the Lord. I 
anticipate that ; am looking for it, 
and expecting it. This Church, 
after a little while, will be looked 
upon, among the churches of the 
world, and in the world, as respecta- 
ble. We are pretty respectable 
now ; that is, we are thought re- 
spectable by the people of the 
earth. We have been respectable 
from the beginning, before the 
world ; and there are people in the 
world today, many of them, that 
consider the Latter-day Saints, the 
"Mormon" people, as the very 
choicest of people there are in the 
world ; and they know it because 
they have discovered morality, pur- 
ity, honesty, integrity, and devotion ; 
they have found them a prayerful 
people, as suggested by the Presi- 
dent this morning. They have 
been taught under the direction of 
the Lord, and have listened, and 
are following out His counsel. 
I thought I would just read a lit-

tie word here, in regard to this 
subject, and then apply it not only 
to the principle of prayer but to 
other principles ; but most import- 
ant, emphasized by the Savior Him- 
self when He visited the Nephites, 
on one occasion, that is the occa- 
sion that I am speaking about now, 
He visited them a number of 
times and gave them very am- 
ple instructions. Wonderful and 
remarkable counsels were given 
to the Nephites by the Son 
of God Himself, in His ministry, 
after His resurrection and ascension 
to the Father. On the occasion re- 
ferred to, He was talking to them 
particularly in regard to the Sacra- 
ment, and gave them special instruc- 
tions. You will find it in the eight- 
eenth chapter of the third book of 
Nephi. He says, after urging that 
they should remember these things 
and attend to them in the season 
thereof — the Sacrament, eating and 
partaking of bread and wine in re- 
membrance of the body and blood of 
the Lord ; He says : 

"Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall 
keep my commandments, which the 
Father hath commanded me that I 
should give unto you . 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye 
must watch and pray always, lest ye be 
tempted by the 'devil, and ye are led 
away captive by him. 

"And as I have prayed among you, 
even so shall ye pray in my Church, 
among my people who do repent and are 
baptized in my name. Behold I am the 
light ; I have set an example for you. 

"And it came to pass that when Jesus 
had spoken these words unto His dis- 
ciples He turned again unto the mul- 
titude and said unto them" — the whole 
people as well as to His disciples that 
He had chosen and given authority to 
baptize and confer the Holy Ghost upon 
the people — 

"Behold, verily, verily, I say unto y6*u, 
ye must watch and pray always, lest ye 



enter into temptation; for Satan de- 
sireth to have you ; that he may sift you 
as wheat ; 

"Therefore ye must always pray unto 
the Father in my name ; 

"x\nd whatsoever ye shall ask the 
Father in my name which is right, be- 
lieving that ye shall receive behold it 
shall be given unto you." 

That principle holds good in re- 
gard to the principle of prayer ; and 
it is important and indispensably 
necessary that the Latter-day Saints 
should be a prayerful people. The 
Lord has so arranged that the 
Priests in the Church shall take par- 
ticular pains to teach the people to 
pray and to walk uprightly before 
the Lord, and to attend to all the du- 
ties that devolve upon them in their 
families. Now, this is one of the pe- 
culiarities of the Latter-day Saints, 
as well as many others — not only the 
gathering, but the principle of 
prayer. There is not a man in this 
Church, who thoroughly attends to 
his duties, but what not only upon 
the Sabbath day remembers the 
Lord and worships Him, and re- 
news his covenants at the Sacra- 
mental table, but every other day. 
Every morning and every night of 
our lives, it is held important and 
necessary, by the Son of God, that 
we should bow the knee before the 
Lord, and that we should remember 
each other, that we should remem- 
ber the work of the Lord, that we 
should remember the necessities of 
the children of men, and that 
we should pray for them, that 
we should call upon the Lord 
and ask for the blessings which 
we require and the success which 
we are entitled to attain to in 
our ministry. For we are minis- 
ters, we are called of God and in- 
spired of Him to perform this labor. 

I thought the splendid exhorta- 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion by President Penrose was 
something very fine, intense, and 
beautiful for us to listen to, that we 
should be found ministering faith- 
fully every day of our lives, every 
man who has received divine au- 
thority from the Lord — just as 
much in the Deacon,the Teacher,the 
Priest, the Elder, Seventy, and High 
Priest, as it is with the brethren 
who are called to preside in the 
Church, and the general authorities 
of the Church, and in the stakes and 
wards in Zion. Every man who has 
this divine authority is called of 
God and is expected to minister, and 
magnify that authority constantly 
— not just for a little while, not 
that they be called on a mission 
abroad, but at home. That is the 
condition of the brethren, we under- 
stand, who are called upon to pre- 
side in wards, stakes, quorums, and 
associations, and that go on mis- 
sions, every man who is called to 
this divine authority, whatever the 
office or position in the Priesthood 
may be, it serves notice on him 
that he is expected to be a laborer, 
just like the president of a stake, 
the Bishop of a ward, the president 
of a mission, just like the president 
of a quorum or council, or the su- 
perintendent of a department, 
whether brethren or sisters. They 
are called and are expected to labor ; 
it is so understood when they are 
set apart; and it is just as true of 
every other person baptized into this 
Church, confirmed, and receiving 
the gift of the Holy Ghost, and re- 
ceive the Priesthood. The brethren 
are called of God and are expected 
to open their mouths and to defend 
the faith and advocate it and teach 
it, at home among themselves, in 
the family, with their neighbors, and 
on all occasions, and to preach it to 



the world by the good examples of 
their lives. That is what is under- 
stood. So that this Church reaches 
out and cares for all, because of its 
organization, for there is no one 
neglected, everybody is recorded 
and registered. It is understood 
what the enrollment is of every 
ward and quorum and association, 
how numerous they are, the Sunday 
schools and the like. Everybody is 
looked after; somebody to care for 
everybody ; no one left to himself 
entirely without anybody to care for 
him and sympathize with him. We 
sympathize with each other, coun- 
sel each other, we compare notes, 
and moderate, and assist each other 
in our lives and labors ; and that 
is what is necessary. 

We can't all come to Conference. 
A few of the brethren are always 
here. You always see President 
Smith here, and his brethren on the 
stand, and these leading brethren 
in the stakes, the High Councilors, 
Patriarchs, and so forth. These 
brethren can come, with a strug- 
gle, but they are nearly always 
here ; they come out faithfully, and 
they are among the very choicest 
of brethren, and they seem to be un- 
der the care and attention of the 
general authorities of the Church, 
and we are kept in pretty fair con- 
dition. Now, that should be true 
of us, then ; it is just as true and 
should be just as true with those 
who are under our influence and di- 
rection, wherever we are. We 
should be just as faithful and devot- 
ed as those under the direction of 
the Presidency of the Church. It is 
necessary, and it will take as much 
to save others as it will to save us ; 
and the Lord requires of us that we 
shall be devoted and faithful, and 
keep the commandments of the 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 27 



Lord, and serve the Lord, and honor 
Him, and walk uprightly in His 
presence all the time ; and those 
that can't come here, we must go 
to them. For the people every- 
where are represented and have 
their representatives here, and the 
brethren who can come here, the 
Saints that' can meet together in 
this Conference, and in quarterly 
conferences, and ward conferences 
should go out to those that are 
abroad and that are not gathered 
together, and cannot come together, 
because of sickness and other con- 
ditions. So there is quite a per- 
centage of the people who cannot 
very well come together. Some of 
them are sick and need attention, 
consideration, consolation, comfort, 
and encouragement ; and that is the 
labor that devolves upon these men 
who bear the Priesthood. 

I have felt, and I hold, that when- 
ever a man receives the Priesthood 
he should receive some instruction 
from his Bishop, from his presi- 
dent, from his file leader, that will 
put him in the line of duty; that 
every Deacon shall be a worker, 
that he shall have some ministry 
assigned to him; and every Priest 
the same — just as well as for me to 
have a ministry, or anybody else. 
The divine authority of the Lord is 
not given to us simply to magnify 
us and that we may feel that we 
have an important office or position 
in the Church, and that it is going 
to save us. It won't save us, it 
would be better that we had not 
received it; as there are expres- 
sions, I think, in the Scripture, 
that it would have been better for 
some people that they had never 
been born than to be born, and to be 
worthless, wicked and corrupt. 
Now, I say that it would be better 



for man not to receive the Priest- 
hood, not to receive an appoint- 
ment or calling, and not to be bap- 
tized in this Church unless he in- 
tends to serve God and keep His 
commandments. Our probation is 
not very long. We can't tell when 
it will end; it is liable to end any 
time; and it is imperatively neces- 
sary that every member of this 
Church should be upon his mettle, 
advised, established, encouraged 
and fixed in his purpose to serve 
God and keep His commandments, 
and do what is right. For every 
member in this Church has all the 
authority that is necessary for 
works of righteousness ; and there 
is no limit or prohibition upon men 
doing good, but we have no right 
whatever to do . anything that is 
wrong ; we do nothing that is wrong 
when in the line of our duty. We 
are not required to do wrong, but 
always to do right and to deal just- 
ly by all men, whether they be Lat- 
ter-day Saints or not, whether they 
be our neighbors or our friends, 
if they be the children of God, and 
they all are, it is our duty to treat 
them in the spirit of righteousness 
and of charity, ind to teach tnei 
the Gospel by that great and elo- 
quent sermon of example. That is 
what we should do. 

With the good things said about 
us today, I think I would never do 
anything wrong, after President 
Smith said the good things to the 
brethren, prominent in the Church ; 
he feels as though they are growing 
and improving right along, possibly 
in better condition than ever be- 
fore; thank the Lord. Let us en- 
dure and continue to the end, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Saints becoming more favorably known 
— Remarkable instance of conversion 
— "Honest people can not be satisfied 
with a dishonest religion" — No com- 
pulsion possible in Church affairs — 
Tithing a free-will offering, and 
source of blessings. 

I always rejoice in having the op- 
portunity of meeting with the 
Saints in our General Conference, 
for the reason that we are always 
blessed, and built up, and strength- 
ened in the Gospel of our Lord 
and Master, Jesus Christ. I be- 
lieve that every Latter-day Saint, 
who has received a testimony of 
the divinity of thfe work in which 
we are engaged, is in duty bound 
to give his or her best thought and 
best endeavor for me advancement 
of the Gospel at home and abroad. 

I am convinced, from my ob- 
servation, and associations with 
people, that the Latter-day Saints 
are becoming better known, that 
they are becoming known for their 
true worth. I believe there are 
many people who have thought that 
we were vile, wicked, and corrupt, 
who are now learning that we are 
the exact opposite. In ancient days 
it was believed by many that the 
Savior of the world and His 
apostles were vile and wicked men, 
and all manner of evil was spoken 
against them, falsely ; nearly nine- 
teen hundred years have passed 
away since the crucifixion of the 
Savior, and men now know that His 
teachings, and the teachings of His 
apostles, and the examples that they 
set before their fellows were for 
the uplifting and the betterment of 
the people. As the years come and 
go, and people have become better 
acquainted with the teachings of 
Joseph Smith and of his successors, 



and of the apostles in this latter- 
day work, they are becoming 
convinced that these teachings are 
for the betterment of mankind. 
There are many men who can join 
in saying what a friend of mine 
once said in a letter to me — and say 
it honestly and conscientiously — 
that the only religious people that he 
had ever known who lived up to 
their professions were the "Mor- 
mons" of Utah. 

So long as we know that we have 
the truth, so long as we love the 
truth, so long as we live the truth, 
we need have no anxiety or care 
regarding what may be said of us. 
It can never hurt an honest man for 
a dishonest and lying man to ac- 
cuse him of dishonesty. If we know 
within our own hearts that we de- 
sire the good of our fellows, that 
we are laboring for the advance- 
ment and the spread of truth at 
home and abroad, that we would 
not knowingly injure any man on 
earth, and that we would willingly 
do anything within out power for 
the benefit of our fellows, what 
harm does it do us, as individuals, 
or the cause of truth, for people to 
write the exact opposite or to speak 
the exact opposite, regarding us or 
the truth? There are many people 
who are deceived because of untrue 
things that are said and written, 
and of certain pictures that are be- 
ing exhibited regarding us which 
are vile and wicked, and which we 
know are libelous. It is an old say- 
ing that a lie can travel around the 
world while truth is getting his 
boots on ; but the fact remains that 
the truth will, eventually, come up- 
permost ; and when people hear or 
see things that are detrimental to 
the Latter-day Saints, and then be- 
come acquainted with them and find 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



29 



that the exact opposite to what they 
have heard and seen is true, con- 
cerning- the life and character- of our 
people, then we are bound to make 
friends of all such persons. 

I rejoice that many men of great 
intelligence have been converted to 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, men of 
great experience and knowledge. I 
rejoiced exceedingly while I was in 
Europe in distributing, or at least 
in urging upon the Elders to dis- 
tribute, a tract known as "My Rea- 
sons for Leaving the Church of 
England and Joining the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 
This document was written by Col. 
R. M. Bryce Thomas, a retired of- 
ficer in the British army. While 
traveling around the world and 
stopping here in Salt Lake City, in 
the old Templeton Hotel, his wife 
was taken sick, and sitting in the 
sick room, looking across the street, 
he saw constantly in front of him, 
on the old adobe building that was 
torn down to make room for the 
Hotel Utah, the sign "Mormon 
Publications for sale here." He 
kept seeing it daily, and seeing it 
till it got on his nerves, and he final- 
ly went and purchased some "Mor- 
mon" publications, read them, and 
he studied the people, and he found 
that they were sober ; he found that 
they were industrious. He learned 
from those not of us that we were 
particularly kind to the poor; that 
there was no class distinction. He 
found many commendable things ; 
and among, other things that he 
found, he said, was the most mag- 
nifiicent choir that he had ever list- 
ened to in his life ; and he went 
away from here impressed with the 
people, with their devotion, with 
their honesty, with their integrity; 
and he pursued his study of the Gos- 



pel and became converted — abso- 
lutely converted. It Has been said 
that the tenderest part of a man's 
anatomy is his pocket ; and this man 
has also been absolutely converted 
in his pocket, as the presidents from 
the time of his conversion until the 
present time, who have presided 
over the London conference can tes- 
tify, because, on a certain day each 
month, a remittance of one-tenth of 
that man's income reaches the Lon- 
don conference, in addition to a 
donation for the benefit of the poor. 
His pamphlet of thirty odd pages 
gives his reasons for joining this 
Church ; and they are reasons that 
cannot be answered and that cannot 
be gainsaid, and that stand out 
prominently and solidly for the di- 
vinity of the work in which you and 
I are engaged. They are substan- 
tial reasons for leaving the church 
with which he had been affiliated 
all the days of his life. 

What has this Gospel done? It 
has gathered in from every land 
and from every clime, honest- 
hearted souls ; it has gathered men 
and women who have honestly and 
conscientiously labored to ascertain 
the truth, many of whom have been 
members of the various sects of the 
day, trying to find that peace, sat- 
isfaction and comfort which the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ ought to 
bring. If this religion called "Mor- 
monism" by the world, was in very 
deed what our enemies say it is — a 
delusion, a snare, and a fraud — do 
you mean to tell me that it would 
satisfy men and women of honor, of 
integrity, of honesty, that it would 
satisfy their very souls ? That they 
could live to be seventy-five, eighty 
and eight-five, and in some cases 
past ninety years of age, and be as- 
sociated with this work from their 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



early manhood and womanhood, 
and that every day, week, month, 
and year, from the time they em- 
braced the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
it would bring" them peace, joy, and 
happiness? It is absolutely ridicu- 
lous to suppose such a thing. Hon- 
est people cannot be satisfied with a 
dishonest religion. Honest, up- 
right, and diligent people cannot 
have their hearts, their faces, and 
their very souls filled with joy, sat- 
isfaction and peace with that which 
is a delusion, a snare and a fraud. 
I tell you, my friends, that this 
Gospel of Jesus Christ brings joy, 
and peace, contentment, happiness, 
and satisfaction to every soul that 
has embraced it, and who obeys it. 

We hear a great deal about com- 
pulsion in this Church. Read sec- 
tion 121 in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants ; and I bear witness to you 
here today, that the men holding the 
Priesthood of God, the leaders of 
this people, the prophets of God 
from Joseph Smith to Joseph F. 
Smith, everyone of them, have exer- 
cised that Priesthood exactly as in- 
dicated in that section. "No power 
or influence can or ought to be ex- 
ercised by the Priesthood only by 
persuasion, by long suffering, by 
gentleness, by meekness, by love un- 
feigned ;" and it has been exercised 
that way. Talk about compulsion 
in obeying the law of tithing! I 
bear witness — and I know that the 
witness I bear is true — that the 
men and the women who have been 
absolutely honest with God, who 
have paid their tithing as religious- 
ly and as corectly as though God 



were their partner, and when they 
settled up their acounts at the end 
of the year that they had made a 
just division, and they paid their 
one-tenth, I bear witness that those 
men and those women testify to all 
the world of the blessings of God 
that have come to them by the ful- 
fillment of this law, and that God 
has given them wisdom whereby 
they have been able to utilize the 
remaining nine-tenths, and it has 
been of greater value to them, and 
they have accomplished more with 
it than they would if they had not 
been honest with the Lord. I bear 
witness that the people who have 
fulfilled this law of God have been 
blessed, and have rejoiced in the 
privilege of showing their gratitude 
to God in a substantial way, for 
His blessings to them. 

I rejoice in the teachings im- 
parted during this Conference ; I re- 
joice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ; 
and may God help us all to be loyal, 
to be true, to be patriotic, to serve 
Him with full purpose of heart, is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Lewis Anderson. 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday, April 6th, 10 a. m. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, 
April 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The Brigham Young University 
choir, of Provo, and soloists, under 
direction of Prof. Anthon C. Lund, 
with Prof. Claire Reid at the great 
organ, rendered the musical num- 
bers at the morning and afternoon 
sessions of the conference, this day. 

The B. Y. U. choir sang the 
hymn : 

O awake ! my slumbr'ing minstrel, 
Let my heart forget its spell ; 

Say, O say, in sweetest accents, 
Zion prospers, all is well. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Hugh J. Cannon. 

The choir sang an anthem, en- 
titled "The earth is the Lord's." 

ELDER HYRTJM M. SMITH. 

Gratifying condition of mutual confi- 
dence in Church Leaders and mem- 
bers. — Utah people urged to sustain 
Utah products and manufactures. — 
Vital statistics of Church evidence 
superiority of its members. — Phys- 
ical power or weakness of parents 
transmitted to offspring. — Long life 
and health insured by keeping God's 
laws. 

I am very desirous my brethren 
and sisters, of enjoying that good 
spirit, while I speak, that the breth- 
ern have enjoyed who have already 
spoken in this conference. My 
heart has been full of gratitude, 



while I have listened to the words 
which have fallen from the lips of 
the Lord's servants. It is a splen- 
did thing to have presiding over us, 
men of undoubted integrity and un- 
swerving faith in the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and the utmost confi- 
dence, as well, in the Latter-day 
Saints, who have taken upon them- 
selves the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and have covenanted with 
Him to serve Him and keep His 
commandments, and to labor to 
build up His kingdom and to spread 
a knowledge of the everlasting gos- 
pel among the children of men. It 
must certainly inspire us, as a peo- 
ple, with confidence in the leaders 
of the Church when we hear them 
bear such fervent testimonies of the 
truth, when we are unable to detect 
the least degree of doubt, or unbe- 
lief or uncertainly in their remarks 
concerning this great latter-day 
work. I rejoice to have part with 
them in the work of the Lord, and 
to be numbered with the people of 
God in this dispensation. I rejoice 
because of the general faithfulness 
of the members of the Church, and 
because of good works that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have done and are 
doing, and I live in hopes that the 
work shall progress in the future, 
and that our accomplishments shall 
be greater in the cause of Zion as 
time goes on. 

My mind has been occupied with 
a great many thoughts, since the 
conference convened, and it is a lit- 
tle difficult to gather such of those 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thoughts as would perhaps be the 
most beneficial to utter. However, 
I suppose, that a Latter-day Saints 
general conference, would not be 
entirely complete unless some few 
words were spoken about our home 
industries. I have visited the "Utah 
Products Exhibit" that is now on 
display in the Vermont Building, 
and I presume very many of you 
have likewise been through that 
building, looking at those products 
of our state. I was gratified in 
seeing what has been accomplished 
by way of producing here at home 
the necessaries and comforts of life. 
I was filled with a little greater 
pride in our State and in the people 
whose industry has brought about 
these results. We are certainly a 
favored people, in this part of the 
earth. The Lord has given us an 
incomparable climate ; He has plant- 
ed our feet upon the richest of soil. 
We have, the climate and the soil, 
and the water,and through the favor 
of God the proper blending of the 
elements that make for the produc- 
tion of those things that are bene- 
ficial and necessary to sustain life. 
Of course we have to make prepara- 
tion. If we are tillers of the soil, 
we have to fertilize it, plow it, cul- 
tivate it ; we have to select the seed 
and plant it with care, and watch 
it during its term of growth ; and 
when this is done, almost invaria- 
bly, our harvest is bounteous and 
our labors prove profitable. The 
fruits of our orchards are unsur- 
passed in excellence. Nowhere in 
our country, or in any other coun- 
try, can there be produced better 
fruit than here in the valleys of 
the mountains ; and the products of 
the farm, and field, and of the flock 
and herd, likewise, cannot be sur- 
passed. 



We are yet in our infancy with 
respect to the mill and the factory r 
and yet our mills and factories are 
now making many of the essentials 
and luxuries of life, which should 
fill us with gratitude to know that 
they are being manufactured here — 
things which have been imported 
very extensively heretofore. Now, 
I am a believer in producing at 
home everything necessary for our 
comfort and welfare as far as it is 
possible, and I am not a believer in 
importing those things which we 
ourselves can either produce from 
the garden, or the farm, or the 
orchard, or can manufacture in our 
various industries. I feel that those 
who have made this exhibition are 
worthy of commendation, and that 
no higher commendation could be 
paid them for their energy than to 
mention the good work they are 
doing, in a conference of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

I noticed the sign in the cabinet 
containing the products of the 
Knight Woolen Mills of Provo. It 
states that if every citizen, or in- 
dividual who lives in the State of 
Utah would purchase one yard of 
the fabrics manufactured in those 
mills the company would not have 
to go out of the State for their 
business. I am satisfied that you 
cannot go out of the State and pur- 
chase better fabrics than are being 
manufactured now in the Knight 
Woolen Mills. I am satisfied, too, 
that everything that bears a Utah 
label is, or ought to be, the equal 
of, or an improvment upon a sim- 
ilar product no matter where it may 
be raised, manufactured, or put up ; 
and the time should come — it ought 
to be here now, and should have 
come long ago — when the things 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



produced at home will be sought 
after and accepted, and demanded 
before anything else. Then it will 
be the same with respect to every 
industry, every home product, as 
with the woolen mills at Provo, that 
if we were to patronize them and 
support them, and use the products 
of our State, all of our present man- 
ufacturers, and many others, who 
will go into the manufacturing busi- 
ness, will find a splendid field for 
their operations. I commend again 
to the people of Utah, "Utah pro- 
ducts" and I repeat the old old 
story that has been so often told 
from this stand, Let us patronize, 
support, and sustain our home in- 
dustries, our home made goods, and 
give encouragement to those who 
have the determination or even the 
inclination to go into the business 
of producing at home the necessar- 
ies of life for the support and sus- 
tenance of our bodies and the mak- 
ing of our homes comfortable and 
pleasant. 

Now, much more could be said 
upon this subject but time will not 
permit, inasmuch as I would like to 
say a few words upon another sub- 
ject which, also, except it was 
touched upon by some one of the 
brethren during our conference, the 
conference in my opinion would not 
be exactly complete. I want to speak 
just a word or two upon the ques- 
tion of the Word of Wisdom, anoth- 
er old story among the Latter-day 
Saints, but one, notwithstanding 
that it is "an oft told tale," has not 
altogether been learned to the ex- 
tent of being remembered and prac- 
ticed by all of the Latter-day Saints. 

I was greatly interested last even- 
ing at the Priesthood meeting in 
hearing the report of Brother Wm. 
W. Riter, chairman of the Auditing 



Committee of the Church, and of 
Presiding Bishop Nibley, concern- 
ing some of the statistics pertaining 
to the Latter-day Saints. I wish 
to refer especially to those statistics 
which had to do with the birth rate 
and the death rate among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. These statistics 
showed that the birth rate was high 
when compared with the birth rate 
of the country at large, and that the 
death rate was correspondingly low 
among the Latter-day Saints when 
compared with other peoples. It 
was stated that there are thirty- 
eight births per one thousand mem- 
bers of the church. I presume these 
figures refer to the stakes of Zion. 
It was also said however, that the 
rate is not as high as it ought to be 
among the Latter-day Saints ; still 
it is high; but as long as it is not 
as great as it ought to be, I desire 
to encourage the Latter-day Saints 
more faithfully in fulfilling this 
great law that God has given, viz. 
multiply and replenish after our 
kind. To beget children, and rear 
them in the fear and admonition 
of the Lord, is one of the chief pur- 
poses of our being. The statistics 
show that, if we have thirty-eight 
to the thousand born in the Church, 
last year it means there were 
more than 12,500 children born 
among the Latter-day Saints. 
Then it was shown that six 
percent of these children died 
before they were one year old. 
We were likewise told that the 
death rate among children under 
one year of age, in civilized coun- 
tries, was twenty per cent, and that 
25 percent died before they reached 
their fifth year. 

Now six percent is very low when 
we merely consider the percentage ; 
but if there were more than 12,500 



3 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



children born in the stakes of Zion 
last year and six percent of them 
died within the year what does it 
mean ? It means that nearly 800, or 
well on towards a thousand of our 
little children, died before they were 
one year old ; and that, after all, is 
a great calamity, a serious condition 
nearly a thousand children among 
us dying before they reach the age 
of one year. Untold sorrow and 
suffering have been endured by the 
fond fathers and mothers and fami- 
lies of these little ones who are 
taken from them in their infancy. 
Now, in my opinion, this is a far 
greater death rate among little chil- 
dren than should occur in the midst 
of the Latter-day Saints, and I be- 
lieve that if the Saints would more 
fully serve God and keep His com- 
mandments — in other words, ob- 
serve the laws of life and health — 
that far fewer of their children 
would die before they are a year old. 
A great many of them who now die 
would live, not only till they are a 
year old but live to grow and ma- 
ture to manhood and womanhood, 
and become a strength and a power 
in the midst of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Our death rate was 8.6 per one 
thousand of our members. And that 
is a very low estimate, when com- 
pared with the deaths occurring 
about us in our country. When we 
look at the figures it means that two 
thousand eight hundred forty one 
Latter-day Saints died last year — 
of numerous complaints, various 
kinds of diseases, and by accidents 
and other causes, many of which 
troubles might have been avoided or 
overcome if the laws of God had 
been more faithfully obeyed. Thus 
an army of Latter-day Saints were 
destroyed last year largely as a re- 



sult of disobedience to the laws of 
health. 

Out of this number it was stated, 
however, that three hundred ninety- 
eight (398) died of old age. It was 
held up that this is a very remarka- 
ble showing, nevertheless it is not 
the showing that we ought to make 
and must eventually make as a peo- 
ple. 

Our death rate must become 
much lower than that ; and the per- 
centage of those who die of old age 
must be greater than that. The time 
must come, and will come in pro- 
portion as we begin to serve God 
and keep His commandments, ob- 
serving the laws of life and health 
which He has given, when most of 
those who die among the Latter- 
day Saints will lay down their bod- 
ies of old age, after they have ful- 
filled the full mission for which they 
have been created. We had a very 
renowned lecturer in our midst a 
short time ago, who declared that 
the three great plagues that decim- 
ated the race and destroyed life 
were : war ; lust ; and narcotism ; 
and that the latter was destroying 
more lives than war. Now we are 
exempt from death to a very great 
degree, as a result of war. We 
are at peace, thank God. We 
are a peaceful people. We ab- 
hor bloodshed. We desire peace, 
that it shall prevail among men. 
And the second plague, I also 
thank God from the bottom of 
my heart, is not the cause of very 
many of the deaths among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, namely lust, which 
causes unspeakable misery and the 
death of untold thousands of peo- 
ple in our country and other civil- 
ized countries of the world; for 
as a result of evil and immoral 
practices children are born subject

to disease and are unable to cope 
with sickness when attacked. They 
come into the world handicapped. 
They are, some of them, deformed, 
some of them blind, many of them 
deaf, some are lame, and a great 
many are imbecile as a result direct- 
ly of the immorality and lust of their 
progenitors. I say thank the Lord 
that this cannot be charged among 
the Latter-day Saints as the cause 
of many of the deaths in our midst. 
But I am not so sure about the 
third plague, namely narcotism, the 
rise of so-called alcoholic beverages, 
intoxicants, the use of tobacco, and 
various drugs, and the use of tea 
and coffee. 

I believe it can be shown that 
a great part of the little children, 
who die among the Latter-day 
Saints are born of parents who have 
transmitted to them, before their 
birth, the elements of weakness and 
disintegration as a result of their 
disobedience to the commandments 
of God, in partaking of the things 
forbidden in the Word of Wisdom. 
It is folly for men to suppose 
that they can break the command- 
ments of God and that they will not 
suffer for so doing. Immoral 
practices of every kind stain and 
corrupt and defile those addicted to 
them, and likewise leave their mark 
upon the children; and their chil- 
dren, thus handicapped, have not 
the vitality, they have not the 
power to resist the inroads of dis- 
ease and infection, and various 
kinds of trouble when they break 
out in our communities. On the 
other hand children of parents who 
have been true and faithful to God, 
in the keeping of His command- 
ments, are endowed from their par- 
ents with stronger bodies and 
greater vitality and ability to with- 



stand more successfully by far 
these things when they are at- 
tacked.- "The iniquities of the 
fathers shall be visited upon the 
children unto the third and fourth 
generation of them that hate me," 
saith the Lord. The men and wom- 
en who can be called them that 
hate God are the men and women 
who repudiate His laws and break 
His commandments, and defy Him 
by their disobedience. "But I the 
Lord will show mercy unto thou- 
sands of them that love me and 
keep my commandments." There- 
fore those who serve the Lord and 
keep His commandments, walking 
in His paths, observing the laws of 
life, transmit to their children the 
vigor, power, and strength to live 
and to grow, and to complete and 
fulfill the object for which they 
are sent into the world; and that 
object is to live. 

God is the author of life, and 
not of death. He wants His chil- 
dren to live. Why, we are told that 
His very glory is to bring about 
the life, even the eternal life of 
man ; and the Lord is anxious that 
we live in mortality successfully 
and long, and thus be better pre- 
pared to enter into eternal life in 
the hereafter. I would like to see the 
children of the Latter-day Saints 
so born — and they are entitled 
to be so born — that they may be 
exempt from these contaminating 
things and these destroying dis- 
eases that take away so many lives 
from among men. I am satisfied 
that only in the keeping of the com- 
mandments of the Lord can this be 
brought about ; I am satisfied that 
by the keeping of the command- 
ments of the Lord the prophecy 
of God shall be fulfilled, that in due 
time as the result of obedience, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



children born shall live to be as old 
as a tree. None shall die until they 
die of old age, having fulfilled the 
measure of their mortal creation. 
Therefore, I exhort again the 
Latter-day Saints to live the law of 
God known as the Word of Wis- 
dom, that they may enjoy and re- 
ceive the promise of health and 
long life, and marrow in their 
bones, the power to endure, to run 
and not weary, to walk and not 
faint, and to put themselves in the 
condition where even the angel of 
death shall pass them by ; for so 
the Lord has spoken. 

I would like to suggest' to the 
Relief Society sisters that they keep 
the Word of Wisdom ; and I would 
like to commence at the very head 
of the Relief Societies in the 
Church, and go down through all 
the Relief Society sisters in the 
Church and plead with them who 
are the mothers, and the sisters 
who will be the mothers, of the 
children of God, to keep the Word 
of Wisdom that their children may 
be endowed with strength and pow- 
er and vitality and energy, that 
they may live and not die. Besides, 
if you observe these laws, your 
faith in God shall be increased, and 
by virtue of your faith, you will 
have great power in the Lord to 
prevail in all the righteous desires 
of your hearts, even to the healing 
of the sick when perchance mem- 
bers of your household may be af- 
flicted with disease, or accident, or 
trouble that threatens their lives. 
And what is more important than 
all, in addition to strong, vigor- 
ous bodies and active, bright minds, 
your children will grow up mighty 
in faith and the knowledge of the 
Gospel. 

I would say to the elders in Is- 
who hold the Priesthood, keep the 



Word of Wisdom; cease taking 
into your bodies forbidden and de- 
stroying things, such as narcotics 
of all kinds, that you may transmit 
to your children bodies strong and 
undeformed, and not weakened by 
disease or afflicted by deformity, 
or blindness, or deafness, or other 
disability. That you may be exam- 
ples of righteousness before your 
children and before all men. I want 
to say to all you elders of Israel, 
and I can say it with the utmost 
thankfulness, that, so far as my 
knowledge goes — and I believe I 
know — the general authorities of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, from the President 
down, are men who are setting an 
example before the people of faith- 
fulness and obedience, with respect 
to the law of God known as the 
Word of Wisdom. They are not 
smokers of tobacco, nor drinkers of 
alcohol, nor of tea or coffee. They 
are exempt and free from those 
things, and they set us a good ex- 
ample. Let us follow that exam- 
ple and serve the Lord, and keep 
His commandments, that our chil- 
dren may be blessed unto the latest 
generation. 

Now, may the Lord bless us and 
pour out His Spirit upon the Saints 
may we accept — oh, that the Lord 
could put into our hearts a will- 
ingness to accept — the advice and 
counsel that may be given to us 
from time to time, and fill our souls 
with a desire, above all, to serve 
the Lord, that we may live to fulfill 
our mission, work out our own sal- 
vation, train up our children in the 
way they should go that they 
may be prepared to spread the Gos- 
pel to the nations of the earth, and 
thereby become saviors of men, to 
call all men to repentance and to 
plead with them to turn from their

sins and serve God and keep His 
commandments, that they likewise 
shall be entitled to eternal life. 
May the Lord bless our brethren 
who shall follow in addressing this 
conference, pour out upon them 
that good Spirit, and use them as 
His servants, to speak to the assem- 
bled Saints, to their edification and 
advancement, to the strengthening 
of their faith and to the building 
up and promoting of all the glor- 
ious interests of Zion, is my prayer 
in the the name of Jesus. Amen. 

"Lord God of Abraham," a bari- 
tone solo, was sung by Brother

Profound reverence for Jesus Christ and 
His mission — Resemblances in the life 
of the Savior and Joseph Smith— Un- 
impeachable evidences of the truth- 
fulness of Joseph Smith's claims. 

I sense very keenly, my brethren 
and sisters, the responsibility resting 
upon me in occupying this position, 
where I am expected to lead this 
vast congregation in profitable 
thought. I have absolute confidence 
in the power of the Lord to assist 
me, and believe that the faith and 
prayers of the Saints will avail 
much with the Lord. I therefore 
ask you, my brethren and sisters, 
to give me your faith and prayers, 
that I may be blessed and that you 
may be blessed. 

The acoustic properties of this 
magnificent building are such that, 
if there were perfect quiet, a pin 
dropped on the stand could be heard 
in the most remote part of the 
building. That reminds me that we 
often, unconsciously, by the moving 



of our feet, coughing, and moving 
about, disturb the congregation and 
make it impossible for some to hear. 
It also makes it necessary for the 
speaker, especially if he have a weak 
voice, to raise his voice so far above 
the natural tone that he disturbs 
himself. 

I can bear witness to the truth 
of all that has been spoken thus 
far in this Conference, and I am 
thankful for it. I am sure that the 
faithful Latter-day Saints have re- 
ceived the same witness that I have 
had with reference to this matter. 

In the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints there are two names very 
closely associated, and very dear to 
us — the name of our beloved Savior, 
Jesus Christ, and our dear Prophet, 
Joseph Smith. The mission and 
labors of these two were not en- 
tirely unlike. We look upon the 
former as the noblest of all the sons 
of God, as the first born of our Eter- 
nal Father in the spirit, and the only 
begotten of the Father in the flesh, 
the Creator of all things, under the 
direction of the Father, the Re- 
deemer and Savior of the world 
who voluntarily gave Himself to a 
life of sorrow and affliction, of 
trial and temptation, on whom was 
heaped all manner of indignities, 
who resisted all temptations to do 
evil, who denied Himself everything 
that was forbidden in the law of the 
Gospel, of which He was the au- 
thor. He did all things that were 
required of Him. doing the will of 
the Father under all circumstances, 
and finally gave His life, a martyr, 
sacrifice upon the cross of Calvary, 
for all of our Father's children. 
This He did that we might be re- 
deemed from the original sin, that 
we might live again immortal be- 
ings ; that after we have laid off 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these mortal bodies, our spirits shall 
take upon themselves again bodies 
which shall not be subject to death, 
nor to suffering as here in the flesh ; 
also that we might be redeemed 
from the effects of our own sins 
and transgressions, and be saved 
with Him in our Father's king- 
dom, through obedience on our part 
to the laws and ordinances of the 
Gospel. We do love the Lord, 
Jesus Christ, our Savior. We love 
His name, and hold it most sacred, 
and we would not profane it. Only 
the base or the ignorant would do 
that. 

We look upon Joseph Smith as 
one of the noblest of the sons of 
God, reserved in the spirit to come 
here upon the earth in these last 
days to be a prophet ; yea the great 
prophet of the nineteenth century, 
of the dispensation of the fulness 
of times. His life was subject to 
sorrow and suffering, for his peo- 
ple, and he experienced constant 
anxiety and interest for the wel- 
fare of the Latter-day Saints and 
the children of men. He was per- 
secuted as was the Savior, and was 
wont to swim in deep water, all the 
days of his short life ; he was prose- 
cuted in the courts, some thirty-nine 
different charges having been false- 
ly brought against him, and he was 
as many times acquitted, for Joseph 
Smith was an innocent man. When 
the persecution became so rife, and 
he had thought to flee from it, that 
he might be of service perhaps for 
many years to come unto this peo- 
ple, whom he loved better than his 
own life, some supposed friends in- 
timated that it was cowardice on his 
part to leave the people under these 
circumstances, and Joseph Smith re- 
marked: "If my life is of no fur- 
ther value to this people it is not 



to me;" and he returned. As he 
was going to Carthage, or about to 
go, he made this remark: "I am 
going like a lamb to the slaughter, 
but my conscience is void of offense 
toward all men ;" and he met his 
death bravely. He was martyred 
and sealed his testimony with his 
blood. And we love him ; he is our 
prophet, the prophet of the dispen- 
sation of the Gospel when we have 
figured, when it has been our priv- 
ilege to tabernacle in the flesh. He 
has been the instrument in the res- 
toration of the everlasting Gospel 
to earth, in the establishment of the 
Church and Kingdom of God, in 
the restoration of the Holy Priest- 
hood, that power and authority to 
minister unto the children of men 
in the ordiances of life and salva- 
tion, and to preach this Gospel in 
all the world. The many revela- 
tions which the Lord gave through 
him to this people, for our enlight- 
enment, for our comfort and joy, 
and our guidance through life, these 
all we appreciate, and it makes us 
to love more and more our dear 
and departed prophet, Joseph 
Smith. 

We have received the witness of 
the Spirit, which has been promised 
to those who will do the will of the 
Father and yield 'obedience unto 
the ordinances of the Gospel. 
Through the Holy Ghost we do 
know that Jesus" rs indeed the 
Christ, the Savior of the world, - 
and that Joseph Smith was a true 
prophet of God, and that this 
work in which we are engaged is the 
work of the Lord, the power of God 
unto salvation. While we cannot 
transfer this knowledge and im- 
press of the Spirit of God to others, 
or transmit it to our offspring, yet 
the promise is to al! that if we will

39 



pield obedience unto the command- 
ments of God we shall receive the 
Holy Ghost ; and it is the office and 
mission of the Holy Ghost to bear 
witness of both the Father and the 
Son. No man can know that Jesus 
is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost ; 
and by the power of the Holy Ghost 
we may know the truth of all 
things. So we promise to the peo- 
ple of the world that they, too, may 
obtain a testimony such as we have 
obtained, in the way in which we 
have obtained it ; but there are other 
evidences, external evidences, I may 
say, which will appeal to the honest 
thoughtful man and woman, of the 
truth of the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

I would like to refer to one evi- 
dence, which I think is one of the 
strongest evidences that we have of 
the truth of these things. I refer 
you to the time when Joseph com- 
menced his ministry. He was living 
with his father's family in the 
township of Manchester in the State 
of New York. It was in the spring 
of the year 1820, and there was in 
that neighborhood at that time a 
great warmth of religious feeling; 
indeed, a revival of the various re- 
ligious denominations. I give credit 
to that condition for the activity of 
the Prophet Joseph, in a religious 
way, at that particular time, for 
he attended their meetings, he read 
the Scriptures, and he was wrought 
up in his feelings. Being a virtuous, 
pure-minded, and conscientious 
young man, religiously inclined, he 
had a desire to join the church 
which would be recognized of the 
Lord, and to do his part; but it 
was difficult for him; in fact, im- 
possible for him to determine which 
one of all these religious denomina- 
tions was right. One day, while 



reading the Bible, he came to the 
first chapter of James, reading the 
fifth verse, as follows : "If any 
man lack wisdom, let him ask of 
God who giveth to all men liberally 
and upbraideth not, and it shall be 
given him." Joseph felt that he, in- 
deed, needed wisdom from the 
Lord, at that particular time, and 
he believed in the Scripture, and 
was impressed with the truth and 
importance of that statement, per- 
haps as much as was the author 
himself when he made it. He de- 
cided to approach the Father in 
prayer. Accordingly, ne went out 
into the woods, and there for the 
first time offered a vocal prayer 
unto the Lord. It was a prayer of 
sincere faith, and it brought an 
answer. He tells us that there ap- 
peared above him a light which far 
exceeded in brightness the noon- 
day sun, and that as the light fell 
upon him he saw two heavenly per- 
sonages standing in the light, im- 
mediately above him, in mid-air, 
whose brightness and glory defy all 
description; that one spoke to him, 
calling him by name, and said to 
him, pointing to the other, "This 
is my Beloved Son; hear Him." 
Joseph, remembering what he had 
come to ask and to pray about, 
asked the simple question which of 
all these religious denominations 
was right, that he might know 
which one to join. To his astonish- 
ment, he was told that they were all 
wrong, that those religious profes- 
sors were corrupt, that they preach- 
ed for doctrine the commandments 
of men, having a form of godli- 
ness but denying the power there- 
of, and that their creeds were an 
abomination in His sight. 

Now, this story told by Joseph 
was either true or false ; and upon 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the truth or falsity of these state- 
ments "Mormonism," so-called, 
must stand or fall; for, if false, 
then would Joseph Smith have been 
stamped as a base deceiver of men, 
an imposter whom God never could 
have thereafter honored in the way 
in which Joseph Smith claims that 
He was honored and recognized of 
the Lord. Had the Lord any 
righteous work to accomplish sure- 
ly He would not have chosen an im- 
poster to represent Him. On the 
other hand, if true, then we might 
expect further manifestations of a 
similar character unto the Prophet 
Joseph; and so Joseph tells us that 
he did have other manifestations. 
He tells us of his receiving the 
golden plates from which the Book 
of Mormon was translated, and 
with those plates the urim and 
thummim, or the holy interpreters, 
by the use of which and by the 
help of the Lord, through His 
Spirit, Joseph was able to inter- 
pret the engravings upon the plates ; 
and by the assistance of Martin 
Harris, Oliver Cowdery, David 
Whitmer and others he was able to 
publish the Book of Mormon. In 
that book, in the fifth chapter of 
Ether, is a prediction by the angel 
Moroni when he sealed up the rec- 
ords, that when the book should 
come forth the Lord would raise 
up witnesses to testify of its truth. 
And the Lord did raise up wit- 
nesses ; but, in the meantime, on 
the 15th day of May. 1829, Joseph 
and Oliver say that the angel, John 
the Baptist, appeared and, laying his 
hands upon them, conferred upon 
them the Priesthood of Aaron, and 
that later Peter, James and John 
came and conferred upon them the 
Holy Melchizedek Priesthood, with 
power to build up the Church and 



Kingdom of God upon the earth — 
to seal on earth and it should be 
sealed in heaven, to loose on earth 
and it should be loosed in heaven. 
Now, what I want to say is this, 
that if it can be proven that any 
subsequent event related by the 
Prophet Joseph, of a divine char- 
acter, was true, then that evidence 
will prove the truth of all the 
events which preceded it, and must 
of necessity prove that the first 
vision which he had and what the 
Lord told him was true. I will 
refer you to the three witnesses of 
the Book of Mormon. I will not 
read their estimony, it is familiar 
to most of you, it is found in the 
front part of the Book of Mormon. 
Those three witnesses, who were 
raised up by the Lord, and whose 
testimony was published unto the 
world as a savor of life or death, 
according as the world should re- 
ceive or reject their testimony, they 
certify that an angel of God came 
down from heaven — this was in the 
latter part of June or possibly in the 
month of July, in the year 1829 — 
and that he brought and laid before 
their eyes those golden plates from 
which Joseph Smith had translated 
the Book of Mormon. They saw 
the engravings upon the plates, and 
they heard a voice from heaven 
saying that they had been translated 
by the gift and power of God, and 
they bear their testimony that they 
do know that the Book of Mormon 
is true. 

Now, the angel had told Joseph 
that this book contained a history 
of the ancient inhabitants of this 
continent, and also the fulness of the 
everlasting Gospel, as it was 
taught by Jesus Himself unto that 
people. We have affidavits re- 
ferring to the character and the tes-

timony of these men, many years 
after their first testimony, which 
go to show that they maintained 
their testimony to their dying days, 
notwithstanding two of them, Oliver 
Cowdery and David Whitmer, left 
the Church. If time would permit 
to bring forth this evidence, it does 
seem to me that it would be con- 
vincing to the honest in heart. Now, 
here is the thing, brethren and sis- 
ters, this point, these witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon, their testi- 
mony, and also the testimony of 
the eight witnesses that they saw 
the plates in the hands of the 
Prophet Joseph, and they hefted 
them, and handled the leaves which 
had been translated ; these testi- 
monies are also proofs that Joseph 
Smith's first story was true, that 
he saw the Father and the Son, and 
also that he heard that which he 
says the Son told him of existing 
conditions. They are also evi- 
dences of the truth of the statement 
that John the Baptist appeared and 
conferred the Aaronic Priesthood 
upon Joseph and Oliver; they are 
also evidences of the truth of the 
statement that Peter, James and 
John conferred upon Joseph and 
Oliver the Melchizedek Priesthood. 
They are also evidences of the truth 
of all those sacred and important 
revelations which Joseph Smith re- 
ceived as recorded in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, prior to that date. 
This, I think, is logic which must 
be accepted. In order to disprove 
any feature of all those statements 
it is necessary to disprove the testi- 
mony of the three and the eight 
witnesses to the Book of Mormon, 
which cannot be done. This is evi- 
dence of the divinity or the divine 
origin of the Book of Mormon, and 
evidence of the divine origin and 



restoration of the Holy Priesthood, 
the establishment of the Gospel of 
the Lord, Jesus Christ, upon the 
earth. 

We have joy in contemplating 
these things, and we say to the 
world that there are a multitude 
of similar external evidences which 
will appeal to you if you will but 
investigate. No man can hope to 
find out the truth without investi- 
gation. No man can hope to find 
out God without investigation, but 
the promise is thai if we will turn 
unto Him, He will turn unto us ; 
and if we ask in faith, and seek 
with a determination that when 
we obtain the light we will yield 
obedience to it, the Lord will lead 
us by His Spirit until we have a 
perfect knowledge and testimony 
of these things. I thus bear you my 
witness and testimony to the truth 
of these things, and pray God our 
Father to bless you my brethren and 
sisters and friends, one and all, that 
all may be brought to the light of 
the everlasting Gospel, and event- 
ually to salvation in His kingdom, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER THOMAS E. M'KAY. 

(Late President of Swiss and German 
Mission.) 

Never before, my brethren and 
sisters, have I felt so keenly the 
necessity of the Spirit of the Lord 
to direct me as at the present time. 
I am very thankful, however, for 
this opportunity of making a few 
remarks upon the conditions that ex- 
ist in the Swiss and German mis- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sion. I am thankful for the oppor- 
tunity I have had of laboring among 
the people in the nations embraced 
in that mission. I am thankful 
because it has helped me to appre- 
ciate more than ever my beloved 
parents, my brethren, and my sis- 
ters. I always did love my father 
and my angel mother, but never be- 
fore have I fully sensed the blessing 
that it is to a son, or to a daughter, 
to have such noble parents ; and if 
any credit i's due me for the labors- 
that have been accomplished dur- 
ing the past three years in the mis- 
sion field, I wish today, before you, 
my brethren and sisters, to give the 
honor to my noble father and to my 
angel mother. I thank my Father 
in heaven for such parents. I love, 
also, and appreciate my brothers 
and my sisters for the influence 
that they' have had upon me. 

I appreciate the brethren upon 
this stand. I am sorry, too, and have 
not yet become accustomed to being 
in a Conference here without see- 
ing our beloved Patriarch, John 
Smith, upon the stand. This is the 
first Conference that I have ever 
attended without seeing him here, 
and also our beloved president, John 
Henry Smith. I am reminded, by 
the changes during the past three 
years, that the responsibility of car- 
rying this work forward will soon 
devolve upon the young men and 
the young women of this Church. 

I thank my Father in heaven for 
the privilege I have had of associat- 
ing, during the past three years, 
with such noble young men as we 
have had in the Swiss and German 
mission. Your sons, over four hun- 
dred of them, passed through the 
mission office while I was there ; 
and I am pleased to bear testimony 
to the integrity, the honesty, and 
the loyalty of these young men. 



They are pure; they are living 
moral lives. Out of over four hun- 
dred and twenty young men who 
have labored there, only two have 
not been able to receive honorable 
releases, and one of them, since he 
has returned, is making good. I am 
pleased that I can make such a re- 
port. I am pleased also to state 
that, through the efforts of these 
young men, and the other young 
men who have been there before, 
and especially through the efforts 
of such men as Presidents Arnold H. 
Schultess, Hugh J. Cannon, Serge 
F. Baliff, Levi Edgar Young, and 
others who have presided over that 
mission, the mission today is in 
splendid condition. During the last 
three years over two thousand five 
hundred souls have been added to 
the Church. 

It is true we are having some 
trouble in some of the cities in Ger- 
many, but this trouble, I believe, has 
been exaggerated. The people at 
home do not quite understand just 
what a "banishment," for example 
means. Some of the mothers who 
have sons there, think, perhaps, of 
Siberia when they read that word 
"banishment ;" but I wish to correct 
that impression. My brethren and 
sisters, we are better protected in 
Germany today than the Elders are 
in Great Britain, or than the Elders 
are in our own America. The of- 
ficials of the German government 
are not personally opposed to our 
missionary work. It is true they 
banish us once in awhile, but they 
do it because of complaints that 
are made against our missionaries, 
by some ministers, so-called. The 
officials who must act upon the 
complaints, as a rule, treat our mis- 
sionaries quite courteously; in fact, 
they sometimes apologize for hav- 
ing to banish them. I wish to say 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY. 



43 



also that because of this trouble 
many of these officials, today, are in- 
vestigating the Gospel. Our mis- 
sionaries have been polite, courteous 
and pleasant to these officials. They 
have borne testimonies to them, and 
have given them our literature; 
and today many of these officials 
are doing all they can to favor our 
missionaries. As one told me, who 
had become acquainted with two 
of our missionaries who were ban- 
ished, he said : "I have learned, 
through this investigation, that your 
young men here are the most moral 
young men with whom I have ever 
come in contact. Through their ex- 
ample I have become interested in 
your Church, and I wish to tell you, 
Herr McKay," taking my hand in 
both of his , as I said good-by, 
"that I will do all in my power to as- 
sist your missionaries and your 
members in their work in this na- 
tion. They are doing a good work. 
I would to God," he said, "that 
all our people were like your 
members in this country of ours." 

In Hungary, which is also a part 
of our mission, we have freedom,and 
I wish to say also that that freedom 
was gained, very largely, through 
the influence of a young man who 
was at first prejudiced against us, 
and became interested in order, as 
he thought, to protect his sister. 
She was an "Israelite," as she called 
herself, a bright young woman who 
became interested in the Gospel, at- 
tended our meetings, and attended 
our choir practices. She and her 
brother were living together — or- 
phans. Her brother became 
alarmed, and called her to task 
for visiting these "Mormon" meet- 
ing so often. She asked him, "Why 
do you object to my going to these 
meetings?" "Why," he said, 
"haven't you heard what kind of 



people the 'Mormons' are ?" "Yes," 
she said, "I have." "Well, then, 
why do you continue to go?" She 
said, "Where did you get your in- 
formation regarding them ?" "Why, 
I have read about them." "Who 
wrote those articles," she said, 
"friends or enemies of the 'Mor- 
mons'?" "Why," he said, "I read 
an attack that was written by a min- 
ister who has lived among them." 
"Do you believe," she said, "all the 
stories that have been written about 
us as Jews? Would it not be bet- 
ter for you to come to these young 
men personally, and visit their 
meetings, and find out for yourself 
what kind of people they are ?" He 
said, "I will do so." The result was 
that he became interested in our 
meetings, and in the missionaries. 
After the first meeting he came to 
the missionaries and said : "Why 
don't you hold these meetings public- 
ly? The people don't understand 
you ; they are laboring under wrong 
impressions." He was told that we 
did not have the privilege of holding 
public meetings, that they had to be 
held as private meetings. He want- 
ed to know the reason. The result 
was he made an investigation. He 
was a young lawyer, and through 
his efforts we obtained — and the ef- 
forts also, I may state, of our Amer- 
ican consul — we received our free- 
dom in Brossau, on the boundary 
line between Hungary and Rou- 
mania. This young man, who is 
now an attorney corresponding to 
our district attorney, made a trip 
from Brossau to Budapest, a twelve 
hours' ride, and would not take one 
penny for his services. 

Other examples could be given to 
show you that the officials of these 
nations are not personally opposed 
to the "Mormon" missionaries. I 
wish to state also that our Ameri- 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



can consuls throughout Europe, or 
that part of Europe belonging to 
the mission — Roumania, Austria- 
Hungary, Switzerland and France 
— treat us as American citizens, and, 
as many of them have told me, "It 
makes no difference to us whether 
you are Jews, Gentile, Mormon, or 
what your religion is, we will treat 
you as American citizens." In 
Budapest we have our main Hun- 
garian branch. Through the ef- 
forts of Elder Hill, who labored 
there, a number of tracts have been 
translated into that language, and 
a number of our songs ; and the 
work is being carried on, now that 
Brother Hill is released, by Elders 
Spry, Parker and Johansen. These 
three young Elders are learning, 
and Brother Spry has made great 
progress in the Hungarian lan- 
guage. I am also pleased to state 
that progress is being made in 
France. We have a branch in 
Lyons, southern France, and sev- 
eral Elders in Menz ; and now in 
Paris we hold regular services on 
Sundays, sacramental meetings for 
students and friends ; and each 
Thursday evening a public lecture 
is given, and a musical program by 
our students. On Washington's 
birthday, there were fifteen of our 
people gathered at our meeting 
place in Paris. Elder Barker of the 
B. Y. University is rendering great 
services for us in Paris. 

The work in Germany is pro- 
gressing, especially in the last two 
years, largely through our Sunday 
schools and choirs. In one of our 
Sunday schools, one of the last I vis- 
ited, there were two hundred and 
twenty-two present, and out of that 
number seventy-five were children 
of non-members. These children 
become interested ; they are placed 
upon the program, on the reviews 



and their parents attend ; in this 
way we meet the parents, and many 
of them are investigating the Gos- 
pel. Our choirs are making good 
progress, we have one organized in 
nearly all of our branches. I am 
pleased that I can make this report, 
and also to report that the people 
there, especially our members, are 
taking care of the Elders, and the 
members are paying tithing. I was 
told by one of the brethren, who 
had looked over the record, that our 
mission has a larger percentage of 
members upon the tithing record 
than any other mission or ward in the 
Church. The people are honest, and 
when they accept the Gospel they 
try to live it, and because of that 
they are being blessed and prosper- 
ed. We are trying to keep them 
where they are ; and because the 
majority of them are remaining, 
our branches today are larger than 
the average ward at home — that is, 
many of our branches. In at least 
fifteen branches we never have less 
than two hundred present at the 
meetings, and ninety per cent of our 
members attend the meetings. 

I am thankful for the associa- 
tions that I have had, especially 
with these four hundred and twenty 
young men. They have strong tes- 
timonies ; they know, as I know, 
my brethren and sisters, that this 
Gospel is true ; they know, as I 
know, that Jesus is the Christ. 
Thousands are asking the question 
today, and among them many so- 
called ministers : ' 'Did Jesus ever 
live?" or, "Is Jesus the Christ?" 
My testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters, is that God lives and 
that Jesus is the Christ. I know it 
as I know that I live. I know fur- 
ther that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the true and the living 
God, and that Joseph F. Smith, who 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



45 



is at the head of the Church today, 
is also a prophet of God. I thank 
My Father in heaven for this tes- 
timony, because I have received it 
from H;im, through inspiration; 
and for that testimony, my brethren 
and sisters, I am ready not only 
to spend six years in the mission 
field, but to devote my life in order 
to show Him my thankfulness. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters ; God bless our missionaries, 
and those who have returned, that 
they may remember always that 
they are missionaries, representa- 
tives of the Church of Jesus Christ. 
God bless you all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I would just like to bear my tes- 
timony to you that the testimonies 
of my brethern, which have been so 
impressively spoken here today, and 
at other times, with reference to the 
divinity of the mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and of the 
gospel of Christ, and of the Son 
of God are true — for I know they 
are true. 

The ' choir sang the anthem 
"Daughter of Zion." 

President Smith read a telegram 
from John W. Young, expressing 
good-will to the Church and its 
leaders. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Stephen L. Chipman.

Prayer was offered by Elder Ed- 
ward J. Wood. 

A bass solo, "Within the Holy

Woodward. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The Power of Testimony — Joseph 
Smith's Account of his first Vision — 
How he saw God — The Gift of Seer- 
ship — Other Instances of its exercise — 
The Church on Earth a Reflex of the 
Church in Heaven — The Speaker's 
Testimony. 

"The pure testimony poured forth by the 
Spirit. 

Cuts like a keen two-edged sword." 

So runs the old hymn, and I have 
been forcefully reminded of that 
declaration during the meetings of 
the conference ; in fact, it has fallen 
to my lot recently to hear more than 
one powerful testimony from the 
servants of God, not only in this 
conference but in other places, and 
it has set me to reflecting upon the 
conditions that surround us at the 
present time. It has more than 
once been pointed out that most of 
our missionaries, traveling in the 
world, are not men of experience, 
of eloquence and argument, but 
mere boys who can only testify, or 
who mainly testify and exhort. 
Some have deplored this condition, 
and have thought they saw in it 
one reason to justify in part a pre- 
diction said to have been made by 
Andrew D. White to Count Tols- 
toy, to the effect that the third gen- 
eration of Latter-day Saints would 
turn from the faith. Their grand- 
parents and fathers and mothers 
might be firmly rooted and ground- 
ed, but the third generation would 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fall away. Some have feared that 
the Church would be weakened 
from the fact that our missionaries, 
most of them, are not men of ex- 
perience, of learning and scholar- 
ship, but are the stripling's of the 
community. These are the ones 
who are preaching the Gospel ; they 
do not reach the scholars, the learn- 
ed men ; they are not capable, it is 
thought, of impressing men and 
women of maturity ; and it is argued 
that this bodes no good to the cause 
of Christ. 

I was led to reflect that it was the 
testimony of a boy, a mere lad, that 
opened the dispensation of the full- 
ness of times, and I know of noth- 
ing more powerful, more searching, 
more beautiful, more sublime, than 
that plain and simple testimony of 
the boy Joseph. I thought it might 
be well to recall that testimony, and 
to read it in part — the testimony of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

"It was on the morning of a beau- 
tiful clear day, early in the spring 
of 1820. * * * After I had re- 
tired into the place where I previ- 
ously designed to go, having looked 
around me and finding myself alone, 
I kneeled down and began to offer 
up the desires of my heart to God. 
I had scarcely done so when im- 
mediately I was seized upon by 
some power which entirely over- 
came me, and had such astonishing 
influence over me as to bind my 
tongue so that I could not speak. 
Thick darkness gathered around me 
and it seemed for a time as if I 
were doomed to sudden destruction. 

"But, exerting all my powers to 
call upon God to deliver me out of 
the power of this enemy which had 
seized upon me, and at the very mo- 
ment when I was ready to sink into 
despair and abandon myself to des- 



truction—not to an imaginary ruin, 
but to the power of some actual 
being from the unseen world, who 
had such a marvelous power as I 
had never before felt in any being ; 
— just at this moment of great 
alarm, I saw a pillar of light exact- 
ly over my head, above the bright- 
ness of the Sun, which descended 
gradually until it fell upon me. 

"It no sooner appeared than I 
found myself delivered from the en- 
emy which held me bound. When 
the light rested upon me, I saw two 
personages, whose brightness and 
glory defy all description, standing 
above me in the air. One of them 
spake unto me, calling me by name, 
and said, pointing to the other, 
'This is My beloved Son, hear Him.' 

"My object in going to enquire 
of the Lord, was to know which of 
all the sects was right, that I might 
know which to join. No sooner, 
therefore, did I get possession of 
myself, so as to be able to speak, 
than I asked the personages who 
stood above me in the light, which 
of all the sects was right, and which 
I should join. 

"I was answered that I must join 
none of them, for they were all 
wrong ; * * * and many other 
things did He say unto me which I 
cannot write at this time. When 
I came to myself again, I found 
myself lying on my back, looking 
up into heaven. 

"Some few days after I had this 
vision, I happened to be in company 
with one of the Methodist preach- 
ers, who was very active in the be- 
fore mentioned religious excite- 
ment, and conversing with him on 
the subject of religion, I took oc- 
casion to give him an account of the 
vision which I had had. I was great- 
ly surprised at his behavior; he 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



47 



treated my communication not only 
lightly, but with great contempt, 
saying it was all of the devil, that 
there were no such things as vis- 
ions or revelations in these days ; 
that all such things had ceased with 
the apostles, and that there never 
would be any more of them. 

"I soon found, however, that my 
telling the story had excited a great 
deal of prejudice against me among 
professors of religion, and was the 
cause of great persecution, which 
continued to increase ; and though 
I was an obscure boy, only between 
fourteen and fifteen years of age, 
and my circumstances in life such 
as to make a boy of no consequence 
in the world, yet men of high stand- 
ing would take notice sufficient to 
excite the public mind against me, 
and create a hot persecution, and 
this was common among all the 
sects, all united to persecute me. 

"I have thought since, that I felt 
much like Paul when he made his 
defence before King Agrippa, and 
related the account of the vision he 
had when he saw a light and heard 
a voice, but still there were but a 
few who believed him ; some said 
he was dishonest, others said he 
was mad, and he was ridiculed and 
reviled; but all this did not destroy 
the reality of his vision. He had 
seen a vision, he knew he had, and 
all the persecution under heaven 
could not make it otherwise. 

"So it was with me, I had actual- 
ly seen a light, and in the midst of 
that light I saw two personages, 
and they did in reality speak unto 
me, or one of them did ; and though 
I was hated and persecuted for say- 
ing that I had seen a vision, yet it 
was true ; and while they were per- 
secuting me, reviling me and speak- 
ing all manner of evil against me, 



falsely, for so saying, I was led 
to say in my heart, Why perse- 
cute for telling the truth? I had 
actually seen a vision, and who am 
I that I can withstand God? Or 
why does the world think to make 
me deny what I. have actually seen ? 
For I had seen a vision. I knew 
it, and I knew that God knew it, 
and I could not deny it, neither 
dared I to do it ; at least I knew 
that by so doing I would offend 
God and come under condemna- 
tion." 

I have never heard an argument 
or an oration equal to that ; and so 
long as we have boys, striplings, 
who can speak by the power of 
God, who can testify by the Holy 
Spirit, we need not despair. Mor- 
monism has in its hand the might- 
iest weapons that man can wield, 
divine authority and the power of 
pure testimony that cuts like a keen 
two-edged sword. Argument has 
its mission, and God can inspire an 
argument just as readily as He can 
a testimony; but there is something 
peculiar about the power of testi- 
mony. It is a pioneer. Argument 
may come afterwards and fill up 
the gaps, build the bridges and the 
cities ; but testimony goes before 
into the wilderness blazing a trail, 
and marking out the way. Joseph 
Smith said, "I saw and I heard," 
and who can gainsay it, especially 
when the words are accompanied 
by the mighty power, the convincing 
power of the Holy Ghost? No 
argument can stand against it, and 
there is enough force and virtue in 
such a testimony to bring the whole 
proud world under condemnation if 
they reject it. 

How did Joseph Smith see God? 
Many attempts have been made to 
explain away this wonderful mani- 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



festation, the latest and most gro- 
tesque attempt being - one that 
would ascribe the glorious vision 
and all that has sprung from it, to 
a fit of epilepsy! I suppose this 
theory rests partly upon the fact 
that the boy according to his own 
statement, found himself "lying on 
his back, looking up into heaven." 
Because he knelt to pray, and then, 
after the vision, found himself upon 
his back, it is inferred that he un- 
derwent some paroxysm, that 
changed the posture of his body, 
and that this change was the result 
of an epileptic fit. But Joseph ex- 
plains it all — he tells what he 
passed through. The power of the 
evil one fell upon him, — pounced 
upon him, and endeavored to de- 
stroy him. Is it any wonder that 
the posture of his body changed? 

While wrestling with that dread- 
ful power, which tied his tongue so 
that he could no longer speak, he 
continued to pray in his thoughts ; 
for "prayer is the soul's sincere de- 
sire," and men can pray secretly as 
well as orally. — Joseph continued to 
pray, in secret, and at the moment 
when he felt that he must abandon 
himself to despair, he was deliv- 
ered, he saw a light, he heard the 
voice, and communed in vision with 
those heavenly Beings. He received 
more than he asked for. His only 
desire, apparently, in going to the 
Lord at that time, was to ask which 
of all the churches was the right 
one, in order that he might join 
it. His question was answered, but 
it was. not the greater part of that 
glorious manifestation. The part 
that was greatest was the part that 
did not speak. What he saw was 
greater than what he heard. He 
beheld the Father and the Son, and 
they w r ere in the form of man — were 



personages, to whom he spoke, and 
who spoke to him; and there and 
then was restored to earth, after 
ages of absence, the lost knowledge 
of the true God. But the skeptical 
say he only thought he saw these 
things — he imagined he beheld 
these personages ; and the commen- 
tator already quoted made the pro- 
found discovery that it was during 
a fit of epilepsy that the boy became 
possessed of the idea that he had 
communed with heavenly beings. 
Anything but to receive the simple 
truth ! Anything but to accept the 
word of a prophet, inspired by the 
Spirit of the Most High. 

Did Joseph Smith see the Father 
and the Son with his natural eyes? 
No ; Joseph Smith was a man like 
unto Moses, for just as Moses 
brought to the ancient world the 
lost knowledge of God, who com- 
manded that men should have no 
other Gods before Him — so Joseph 
Smith brought back that same 
knowledge to the modern world. 
While translating the Book of Mo- 
ses, Joseph rendered with his own 
mind this passage, in which Moses 
describes the manner and means 
by which he beheld Deity: 

"But now, mine eyes have beheld 
God, yet not my natural but my 
spiritual eyes ; for my natural eyes 
could not have beheld, for I should 
have withered and died in His pres- 
ence." Pearl of Great Price, Book 
of Moses, Chapter 1, Verse 11. 

Joseph Smith being the interpre- 
ter of these words of Moses, we may 
reasonably conclude that the way in 
which he saw the Lord was the 
same way in which Moses had be- 
held him. 

Morever, Joseph himself, with 
Sidney Rigdon, thus testifies : 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



4 ( J 



"We, Joseph Smith, Jr., and Sid- 
ney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on 
the 16th of February, in the year of 
our Lord one thousand eight hun- 
dred and thirty-two, by the power 
of the Spirit our eyes were opened, 
and our understandings were en- 
lightened, so as to see and under- 
stand the things of God * * * 
And the record which we bear is 
the fulness of the Gospel of Christ, 
who is the Son, whom we saw and 
with whom we conversed in the 
heavenly vision." Doctrine and 
Covenants, Section 76, verses 11, 12 
and 14. 

There is the explanation of it. 
No imagination, and no epilepsy ; it 
was an actual vision, but one seen 
with spiritual eyes. Were we not 
all spirits before we took these 
bodies? Did we not walk by sight 
while in the spirit world, keeping 
our first estate, proving our right, 
demonstrating our worthiness to 
come here and walk by faith, and 
keep, if possible, our second estate ? 

It must not be forgotten, either, 
that Joseph Smith had the powers 
of a seer — that he was "a choice 
seer," one doubtless prepared from 
the foundations of the world, to do 
the work he did, and to see what 
he saw. There may be such a 
thing as inherent power of seership, 
inherent in the spirit, for aught I 
know; but at all events we may 
reasonably conclude that this man 
came into the world to see, and was 
endowed with power by the God of 
heaven for that purpose ; and there 
need be no strained attempt at ex- 
planation. 

There is something so marvelous 
about it, however, and this is a day 
that questions marvels and miracles 

that men would fain do away with 

it. It is too wonderful for modern 



thought. Just as they would dis- 
card the divinity of Christ and do 
away with His miracles, so would 
they do away with the wonders that 
lie at the foundation of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

And yet, it was "a marvelous 
work and a wonder" that Isaiah 
predicted, when he foretold the 
work of the Lord as pertaining to 
these days — a work before which 
"the wisdom of the wise" should 
"perish," and "the understanding of 
the prudent" should "be hid." Then 
why marvel when the miracles be- 
gin, or rather, why reject those mir- 
acles ? After reading the Bible for 
centuries, why is not the Christian 
world prepared for God's marvel- 
ous work and wonder, and why does 
it reject the testimony of his serv- 
ants in relation to it ? It was by the 
gift of seership, and by the power 
of the Holy Ghost that Joseph 
Smith saw the Father and the Son. 
And he beheld the angel Moroni 
by the same gift and power, and 
received from him the record plates 
of the Book of Mormon. He saw 
in like manner John the Baptist, 
and Peter, James and John, and re- 
ceived from them the Priesthoods 
of Aaron and Melchisedek, under 
which authority this Church was 
organized on the sixth of April of 
the year 1830. 

I am told that Joseph Smith had 
such power as a seer, that after he 
had received from the angel those 
plates, he could sit in his father's 
humble cottage, while the record 
was secreted at a distance, and could 
read what was on the plates and re- 
late it to those around him. 

President Joseph F. Smith, with 
the late Orson Pratt, the Apostle, 
had an interview with David Whit-

mer, I believe in the year 1877, and 
he related to them a wonderful ex- 
perience of his own, when he was 
sent from Fayette, New York, to 
Harmony, Pennsylvania, to bring 
Joseph Smith and his scribe Oliver 
Cowdery to his father's home, 
where they might continue in peace 
the work of translation. David 
Whitmer said : 

"When I arrived at Harmony, Jo- 
seph and Oliver were coming to- 
wards me, and met me some dis- 
tance from the house. Oliver told 
me that Joseph had informed him 
when I started from home, where I 
stopped the first night, how I read 
the sign at the tavern, where I 
stopped the next night, etc., and 
that I would be there that day be- 
fore dinner ; and this was why they 
had come out to meet me. All of 
which was exactly as Joseph had 
told Oliver, at which I was greatly 
astonished." 

Six months after the Church was 
organized, Oliver Cowdery, Par- 
ley P. Pratt, and other Elders 
started upon a mission to the La- 
manites ; and, coming to Kirtland, 
in northern Ohio, they preached 
the Gospel there, and gathered into 
the fold quite a number, among 
them Edward Partridge, who be- 
came the first Bishop of the Church ; 
Algernon Sidney Gilbert, Frederick 
G. Williams, Sidney Rigdon, and 
my grandfather, Newel K. Whit- 
ney, with his wife, Elizabeth Ann 
Whitney. These disciples, hearing 
that the Church would probably 
move -westward, began to pray for 
the coming of the Prophet. I have 
heard my grandmother and my 
father relate that when the Prophet 
came to Kirtland he drove in a 
sleigh and halted in front of the 
mercantile store of Gilbert and 



Whitney. He sprang out, went into 
the store, walked up to the junior 
partner, and said: "Newel K. Whit- 
ney, thou art the man." Grand- 
father was astonished ; he had never 
seen Joseph Smith till then — Joseph 
had never seen him with his natural 
eyes — and he answered : "Stranger, 
you have the advantage of me ; I 
could not call you by name, as you 
have me." And the stranger then 
said : "I am Joseph, the Prophet. 
You have prayed me here. Now, 
what do you want of me?" 

By what power did this remark- 
able man, Joseph Smith, recognize 
one whom he had never before seen 
in the flesh? Why did not Newel 
K. Whitney recognize him ? It was 
because Joseph Smith was a seer, a 
choice seer ; he had actually seen 
Newel K. Whitney upon his knees, 
hundreds of miles away, praying for 
his coming to Kirtland. Marvel- 
ous — but true ! 

Another incident in my grand- 
father's experience with the 
Prophet shows further this power 
of seership. In the year 1832, after 
Newel K. Whitney had become 
Bishop of Kirtland, they went down 
to Independence, Missouri, where 
Edward Partridge was Bishop in 
Zion, .and while returning Bishop 
Whitney met with a serious acci- 
dent. The coach upon which they 
were traveling had a runaway. The 
Prophet leaped from the coach and 
cleared the wheels, but the Bishop, 
attempting to do likewise was caught 
in the wheel and his leg broken in 
several places. As a result of this 
accident they were detained several 
weeks at Greenville, Indiana, where 
they put up at a public house ; Elder 
Rigdon, their traveling companion, 
meanwhile going on to Kirtland. An 
attempt was made upon the Proph-

et's life by poisoning, so that he 
deemed it prudent to leave the place 
as soon as possible, and he proposed 
to the Bishop that they go at once. 
What followed is thus recorded in 
the History of the Church, as com- 
piled and edited by Brother B. H. 
Roberts. This is the Prophet's own 
language : 

"Brother Whitney had not had 
his foot moved from the bed for 
nearly four weeks, when I went into 
his room, after a walk in the grove, 
and told him if he would agree to 
start for home in the morning, we 
would take a wagon to the river, 
about four miles, and there would 
be a ferry boat in waiting which 
would take us quickly across, where 
we would find a hack which would 
take us directly to the landing, 
where we should find a boat, in 
waiting, and we would be going up 
the river before 10 o'clock, and 
have a prosperous journey home. 
He took courage and told me he 
would go. We started next morn- 
ing, and found everything as I had 
told him." — Volume I, page 272. 

Instances might be multiplied, if 
necessary. Not only by the gift of 
prophecy, but by the power of seer- 
ship, Joseph Smith was able to fore- 
cast the future. It was by that mir- 
aculous power that he saw the 
Father and the Son. It was by that 
wonderful power that he and Oliver 
Cowdery saw Jehovah, Moses and 
Elijah in the Kirtland temple; and 
by which also Joseph and Sidney 
gazed upon the glories of the celes- 
tial, terrestrial and telestial worlds. 
By that marvelous power the 
Prophet, in all probability, beheld the 
great organization of the Church of 
God in heaven; for while organiz- 
ing the councils and quorums of the 
Priesthood, he said : 



"And it is according to the vision, 
showing the order of the Seventy, 
that they should have seven presi- 
dents to preside over them, chosen 
out of the number of the Seventy." 
— Doctrine and Covenants, 107 :93. 

Now, if he saw the Seventies in 
vision, why not the Apostles ? Why 
not the First Presidency? Why not 
the stakes and wards, with their pre- 
siding officers, and even the auxili- 
ary organizations? Who can say 
that he did not see them ? Who can 
say that these quorums of the 
Priesthood, these auxiliary societies 
and associations, the Church of God 
in its entirety as it exists upon the 
earth, is not a reflex of the Church 
of God in heaven, so far as it is 
adapted to our present conditions,' 
so far as it has been found neces- 
sary to organize it here ; the even- 
tual outcome to be a perfect Church, 
corresponding in every particular to 
the Church of the First Born ; and 
this that the will of God may be 
done upon earth even as it is done 
in heaven? 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
have never seen Joseph Smith ; but 
I believe in him just as firmly and 
fervently as if I had seen him ; I 
love him and revere his memory just 
as much as if I had known him in 
the flesh. I never saw Jesus Christ 
as Joseph Smith saw him. My gifts 
are different. I am not worthy, 
perhaps, of such an honor. If I 
have seen the Lord, it was in a 
dream ; but it was enough — it was 
powerful enough for me. I saw 
Him, and I conversed with Him, 
and He told me what to do — but it 
was only a dream. I used to think 
that if any good boy would go and 
pray, the Lord would show Him- 
self and speak to him just as freely 
as He did to Joseph. It was a 



52

childish thought, and when I be- 
came a man I put away childish 
things. We all have access unto 
God. We can all receive revelation 
from Him, as President Smith has 
assured us ; but men are not all the 
same ; they do not all possess the 
same gifts, the same powers, the 
same privileges. There is one Spirit, 
but a diversity of gifts and mani- 
festations. And when the Lord 
answers your prayers and mine, 
He will give to us, or send 
to us, or speak or otherwise 
manifest to us, according to our 
gifts, our capacities — and not those 
of someone else. But we can all 
have a testimony that this is God's 
work. I have that testimony. I be- 
lieve this to be the work of the Lord. 
My name may be cast out as evil 
for that belief ; I accept the issue ; 
I believe this to be God's work ; I 
know it is God's work ; and I know 
that God knows that I know it ; and 
I cannot and would not deny it for 
all the world. Amen.

Simple faith of the child should be emu- 
lated. — Surprising continuation of can- 
ards against the Church. — Utah publi- 
city movement commended. — Advan- 
tages of residence in Utah enumerated. 
— Tribute to high character of Utah's 
"Mormon" citizens. — Futility of ef- 
forts to destroy the Church. 

My heart is filled with joy for the 
rich outpouring of the Spirit of God 
during these meetings. Seldom if 
ever have I been more deeply im- 
pressed with the glorious and beau- 
teous possibilities of the gospel of 



Jesus Christ than I have during the 
sessions of this most successful con- 
ference. Oh, I am thankful to the 
Lord for my membership in the 
Church. I appreciate the fellowship 
and brotherly love of the servants 
of God. I have rejoiced at the 
glorious truths so eloquently por- 
trayed to us by my beloved brother 
Whitney. I was particularly im- 
pressed with the simple remark that 
he used to believe, as a 'child, that 
he could go to God and talk to Him 
as he could talk to his earthly father 
or to an associate. In my soul I 
said, "and you could." I know that 
the simple faith of a child is ans- 
wered by our kind Father in heaven 
in blessings and comfort to the little 
child. I will bear my testimony 
to that before this vast congrega- 
tion. I know that God hears and 
answers the prayers of the child. 
I remember lying one night, trem- 
bling with fear. As a child I was 
naturally, or unaturally afraid of 
the darkness, and would frequently 
lie wondering about burglars "bug- 
a-boos" and unseen influences. So 
I lay this night completely un- 
nerved ; but I had been taught that 
God would answer prayer. Sum- 
moning strength I arose from the 
bed, knelt down in the darkness, and 
prayed to God to remove that feel- 
ing of fear ; and I heard as plainly 
as you hear my voice this afternoon, 
"Don't be afraid nothing will hurt 
you." Oh, yes, some may say — 
"simply the imagination." Say what 
you will, I know that to my soul 
came the sweet peace of a child's 
prayer answered. That is the faith 
which is inculcated into the minds 
of the Mormon boys and girls in 
every Latter-day Saint home 
throughout the land. I submit that 
where children are brought up in

close communion with our Eternal 
Father that there can not be much 
sin or much evil in that home. When 
a little suffering child burning with 
fever, will look up to his father and 
in simple faith say, "Papa, bless 
me," I want to tell you that from 
such homes arise the strength and 
the glory of any nation. Such are 
the homes of Latter-day Saints. 

Why, then, do people revile the 
Church Why do they think that we 
are not true Christians, that we are 
not loyal citizens, that we are not 
true men and virtuous women — and 
virtuous men, for there is but one 
standard of virtue in the Church of 
Christ for man and woman. We 
•can exclaim with the prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, "Why persecute, for 
telling the truth?" Well, men and 
women who investigate the doc- 
trines of the Latter-day Saints do 
not revile them, do not slander 
them ; it is the men and women who 
are ignorant of what the Church 
is and what the people of God stand 
for ; and their ignorance is played 
upon by malicious vindictive men 
who try to make capital out of the 
unpopularity of "Mormonism." 

I have wondered recently at the 
means that have been brought to 
bear against the reputation of this 
Church, the most powerful known 
to this advanced twentieth century. 
First, the power of the pulpit. Al- 
most universally, men who stand as 
guides to the people have felt it 
their duty to denounce the doctrines 
we advocate, to denounce the rev- 
elations of God through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. Occasionally we have 
men come here who get a clear in- 
sight into what the Church is doing, 
who recognize the strength of the 
teachings as applied in the home 
life of the people, and who are brave 



enough to declare to the world what 
they find. One of our brethren in 
Ogden, the Rev. Mr. Fisher, was 
brave enough to enlighten his fellow 
workers recently as to what he finds 
here. But, generally speaking, I 
say, the power of the pulpit has been 
arrayed against us. Following that, 
the power of the press. Has there 
ever been, in the history of the 
Church, such a wide spread attack, 
from the standpoint of the press, 
as there has been within the last few 
months ? And it still continues, the 
latest being one of the London pa- 
pers to publish to the world a lie 
against our state. And a stronger 
means of disseminating knowledge, 
even than the press, has been 
brought to bear against us. I refer 
to the motion picture show. When 
you read a book you depend upon 
the printed page for your mental 
pictures. If those characters are 
readily interpreted the reader will 
probably get the idea or the picture 
which the author intended to ex- 
press ; but when you may sit and see 
it acted, see it portrayed as naturally 
as though it were being enacted in 
the every-day life, then the mental 
pictures are given as definitely and 
as rapidly as the motions of the 
actors can portray them. I have 
here an excerpt from a letter of a 
young man who went into the mis- 
sionary field a few months ago. He 
is the grandson of the late Apostle 
Franklin D. Richards, and is labor- 
ing in the mission from which so 
many of the founders of our church 
came, and among them his grand- 
father. He writes to his father 
Pres. Chas. C. Richards as follows : 
"For the last ten days, the mov- 
ing picture entitled. "A Victim of 
the Mormons" has been put on at 
different houses. Like the rest of 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the pictures you have read about 
in the News this one is quite offen- 
sive to the 'Mormon' Elder. It is 
a foreign film, and portrays a 'Mor- 
mon' Elder enticing a young girl 
away from her home, taking her to 
Utah, eluding- officers, etc. She 
tries to escape, and is rescued by 
her brothers, at which the Elder 
shoots himself." Continuing, he 
shows the inconsistency of it — the 
foreign officers, the foreign uni- 
forms, the fake temple, and all that ; 
and then says : "It is a shame that 
the men and women composing the 
national board of censorship for 
moving pictures cannot see the un- 
truthfulness of the picture and re- 
ject it. Satan is surely filling the 
hearts of men and leading them 
astray from the true life. Last 
week we received a letter and a no- 
tice from the Evangelical Alliance 
of Greater Boston, called The Inter- 
denominational Organization, to at- 
tend their service Monday, at 10: 30. 
The subject for discussion — 'The 
Mormon Hierarchy!" He and his 
companions accepted the invitation 
and listened to the remarks of two 
women whose attitude should be 
characterized as malicious, if it 
were not so pitiable. Commenting 
on the meeting he says : "You read 
her articles in the papers I sent you 
in December. It was just a repeti- 
tion of that. Poor thing, she is 
getting worse every day. She will 
end in the mad house yet, I am 
afraid. Another woman took up 
the subject of 'Missionary and polit- 
ical activities of the Mormon 
Church,' repeated the same old lies 
about the missionaries, but praised 
Senator Smoot — said he was the 
greatest money senator in the Con- 
gress ; that he was a very frequent 
caller at the White House ; that he 



was helping rule the nation ; that 
Wall Street worshiped him — all 
told to emphasize her point that the 
Mormon Church was a great polit- 
ical machine, and if the people did 
not put it down, in a few years it 
would govern the country. She ad- 
mitted that Senator Smoot was such 
a powerful man his influence was 
felt in Massachusetts legislature ;" 
and so on. That is but one illus- 
tration. I cannot help but think of 
the attitude of that young man 
against those three forces which are 
being arrayed against his people. 
He and the two thousand other 
young men, who are in the field 
known that these ministers and mo- 
tion pictures are defaming the char- 
acter of the people of the Mormon 
Church. 

Now, in view of these condi- 
tions, I hail with delight the move- 
ment now becoming popular, ex- 
pressed in the slogan that hangs 
opposite the south gate of the tem- 
ple block, and which I hope every 
man and woman in this State will 
echo from the bottom of his or her 
heart; it reads: "I am for Utah." 
It behooves every man and woman 
to be true to the standards of this 
State ; and if we can be, we need 
not fear for any of these attacks 
from the outside. Eighty-three 
years ago this month the Lord said 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, by 
way of comfort, and through him 
all the little Church, or the people 
who composed the Church at that 
time: "Fear not. little flock: do 
good; though all earth and hell 
combine against you, if ye are built 
upon my rock they cannot prevail." 
Just consider those few words, 
"Fear not little flock; do good." 
That is characteristic of the atti- 
tude of this work today — a calm- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



55 



ness, a dignity, .an independence 
that puts it above all these trifling, 
yet sometimes disgusting attempts at 
persecution, at reviling, and sland- 
ering. Indeed the attitude of the 
Church is wholly in keeping with 
the admonition given bv the apostle 
Paul : 

"Recompense to no man evil for evil. 
Provide things honest in the sight of 
all men. 

"If it be possible, as much as in you 
lies, live peaceably with all men. 

"Avenge not yourselves, but rather 
give place unto wrath : for it is written, 
Vengeance is mine ; I will repay, saith 
the Lord. 

"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, 
feed him ; if he thirst, give him drink : 
for in so doing thou shalt heap coals 
of fire on his head. 

"Be not overcome of evil, but over- 
come evil with good." 

That is just the effort that is now 
being put forth by the men who are 
back of this Utah movement, I be- 
lieve. I was delighted to hear that 
the publicity bureau of this state 
is now sending out two hundred let- 
ters daily. I suggest that they keep 
in mind* this statement, "Provide 
things honest in the sight of all 
men." 

What, are some of the honest 
statements that may be made about 
our State? When a man seeks a 
place for a home, he naturally asks 
the question: What will it do for 
me and my family in a material 
way? What may I obtain in an 
educational way? What does it of- 
fer socially? What is the spiritual 
standing of that community ? Utah 
already ranks among the highest in 
all these features. In productiveness 
Utah's soil ranks among the first; 
indeed, for the production per acre, 
of the staff of life, Utah ranks se- 
cond among all the States in the 
Union, and that too in the face 



of the fact that three-fourths of the 
land producing wheat is what we 
call dry land that is, the wheat is 
produced on dry farms ; and yet in 
the productiveness of the soil, she 
ranks, among all the states, second. 
In regard to the other cereals she 
ranks alternately first and second, 
oats, barley, potatoes ; first in the 
production of sugar beets. Utah 
was the first State in the Union to 
raise a sugar beet on irrigated land. 
Utah was the first State in the Un- 
ion to build a sugar factory, by ma- 
chinery manufactured in the U. S. 
Utah ranks high, too, in offering ad- 
vantages in stock-raising, mining, 
and fruit growing. How does she 
stand educationally? In the school 
year 1909-10 the state spent over 
three million dollars for the educa- 
tion of the boys and girls. The 
school property of the state is 
worth over six and one half million. 
The state institutions the Univer- 
sity, and Agricultural College rank 
among the best in the country — 
The School of Mines in our State 
is among the best, I am informed, 
in the United States. From the 
School of Arts and Sciences, from 
the School of Law and Medicine, 
the students are admitted in any of 
the Universities of this country on 
an equal basis 'with the graduates 
from their own schools. Our Agri- 
cultural College, particularly, with 
the extension course, is an inspira- 
tion to all the farmers and stock 
raisers throughout this land — none 
better anywhere can be found. In 
addition to the excellent public 
school system, the Church is sup- 
porting a system comprising twen- 
ty-eight high schools, at an addi- 
tional expenditure of over three 
hundred and sixty thousand dollars 
annually, thus furnishing high 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



school training to nearly ten thou- 
sand students. No better general 
educational advantages can be 
found anywhere, no matter where 
you go ; and the result of it is that 
there are more people in this state 
who can read and write than can 
be found in any other state in the 
Union excepting, possibly, three. It 
is a little difficult to ascertain just 
the standing of Utah in regard to 
that. There are three ahead and I 
think one other on an equal basis. 

Socially, how does she stand? 
Why, let this answer: a testimony 
of a United 'States consul concern- 
ing the boys whom he has met. 
Now, you know who these boys are. 
They are from your home, farmer. 
They are from your home, business 
man. They are from your home, 
school teacher. They are picked up 
from all parts of the Church ; and 
so their standing is a fair index to 
the social conditions of the people. 
This is what he says. 

"It is fair to state that for a clean, 
moral, economic life, for gentleness, and 
courtesy, and for a proper appreciation 
of their position as visiting foreigners, 
they form aside from their religion, the 
truest and most worthy types of the 
modern American citizen. They make 
no display of money. They do not talk 
of the power of the United States and 
backwardness of Europe. They seek the 
beautiful and the good, and take back 
with them to their homes the ambition 
for better and greater things for their 
people and for their country." 

And of whom does he speak 
thus ? As an illustration of the men 
he met, he says : 

"Of five missionaries interviewed by 
me, one young man came from a posi- 
tion as clerk in a clothing store in Lo- 
gan, Utah ; another had been an ordin- 
ary painter in Ogden ; another a car- 
penter in Salt Lake City; the fourth 



had been a country school teacher; and 
the fifth had come from high school." 

Socially, what kind of men and 
women may we meet? I have just 
been thinking of the presidencies of 
stakes, the bishoprics of wards, the 
young men and young women 
comprising the stake boards, the 
army of priesthood working in 
the high council — aggregate those 
workers and where in all the 
world can be classed a purer 
set of men and women? I am 
not given to say repeatedly that we 
are the best people on earth, and 
all that ; because we have so many 
weaknesses, and we fail to reach our 
pretentions ; but in these officers, we 
have a class of men and women who 
will compare socially and morally 
with any group of men and women 
in the world, the percentage of 
purity, I am sure, ranking near 
ninety-eight or ninety-nine per cent. 
I know them and so do you. Where 
do these men and women come 
from? Why, from the homes of 
the Latter-day Saints, representing 
all the people, wherever you find 
them located — no specially picked 
men. It is true, they are chosen 
because of their service and their 
ability to serve others ; but they are 
generally representative of the so- 
cial standard of the people 

Finally, what is the religious con- 
dition? Here, we find the head- 
quarters of the Church of Jesus 
Christ, an organization where every 
man is a minister of the gospel ; 
nearly one hundred thousand men 
and boys holding the priesthood, 
everyone of whom should be a min- 
ister, everyone carrying responsi- 
bility or doing good" to his fellow 
men — and that too in an organized 
systematic way. Go into the homes ; 
there you will find the true Latter-

day Saint and his family kneeling

breakfast in the morning, gather- 
ing his wife and family around him

God. There the children take their

men like the one picked out from a 
little southern town here' a short 
time ago. A prosperous business 
man received a call to go out to 
preach the gospel. He left his bus- 
iness, left all, and went to his mis- 
sionary field so far away from his 
home that, to use the expression of 
one of the elders, if he had gone any 
farther he would have started back 
home. Down here in Thistle, only 
a week or two ago, I met his son 
a young man who had in charge 
several cars of cattle. He intro- 
duced himself ; he said, "I heard 
you a few weeks ago, while visiting 
a conference." During the conversa- 
tion I learned that when his father 
received the call to go on his mis- 
sion, with only thirty days notice, 
it devolved upon the son to lead in 
the support of the family, and to 
keep his father out in the mission- 
ary field He said, "I was not equal 
to running his business, yet, I am 
doing my best ;" and he added "We 
are succeeding;" and he is. The 
more I think of that circumstance, 
the more deeply impressed I am 
with it — the father out preaching 
the gospel. Why, Because he knows 
the value of life ; because he knows 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ is re- 
stored, his only motive being to 
preach that truth to the world — 
And here is his boy assuming the 
responsibilities of manhood, carry- 
ing on the work, supporting not on- 
ly himself, but his father's family, 



and his father in the mission field. 
Talk about development ! Thank 
God for the Church that picks its 
young men up that way and puts 
responsibility upon them. For Utah ? 
Yes. For the Church of Christ? 
Always. And if we can only be true 
to what we know is right, to what 
we know is the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, "Though all earth and hell 
be arrayed against us, they can not 
prevail." 

God help us to go forth from this 
conference imbued with the Spirit 
of the Lord, that every man and 
woman who has an opportunity to 
work in the Church — and that means 
all — may be determined to live a 
life of virtue and purity that will 
command the strength of the world, 
and the admiration of it. In short, 
let us provide things honest in the 
sight of all men. If it be possible, 
so far as in us lies, let us live peace- 
ably with all men — not overcoming 
evil by evil, or being overcome by 
evil, but overcoming evil with good. 
Then will . the Church stand as a 
light to the world. That is her des- 
tiny ; and though enemies may hurl 
their shafts to destroy, they will fail 
just as the beetles and the moths 
fail to obliterate the electric light 
in the street. Once in a while, per- 
haps, you have seen the light flicker 
when one would fall and be con- 
sumed ; but next morning if you 
walked past, there on the ground 
you saw the beetles and the moths. 
They lost their lives in their vain 
and blind attempt at striking out 
the light. So must it inevitably be 
with those who oppose the Church 
of God. Men, misguided and ig- 
norant may hurl themselves against 
it ; but after all, if the members of 
the Church will only be true when 
the mists of ignorance and preju- 
dice shall have cleared away, and

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we stand in a true light, we shall 
find that every shaft that has been 
hurled against Zion has fallen ; 
every tongue that has been raised 
against her has been confounded. 
God help us to be successful, to be 
true to the testimony ; through Jesus 
Christ, Amen.

Each and all of those named were 
duly sustained in the positions des- 
ignated, by unanimous vote of the 
congregation assembled in Confer- 
ence. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I would like, also, to say this, 
that Brother Hyrum G. Smith, who 
has been selected to fill the vacancy 
resulting from the death of the late 
Patriarch John Smith, is a literal 
descendant of John Smith, but he is 
his grandson, and not his own son. 
The grandson has been a clean, 
pure, intelligent boy; he has been 
faithful and exemplary throughout 
all his life, and has never been ad- 
dicted to any habits that he had to 
abstain from, to be in harmony 
with the principles of the gospel. 
The question of looking over the 
children and grandchildren of the 
Patriarch was submitted to the 
twelve apostles, as it is the duty of 
the twelve apostles to look after, 
and select, and ordain evangelists 
in the church; and after due con- 
sideration, they have unanimously 
recommended the grandson of the 
late Patriarch to fill the place of his 
grandfather. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 

The title of the beautiful anthem 
that will now be sung by 
the B. Y. U. choir is "The 
Lord hath brought again Zion." 



Brother Arthur Shepherd's at- 
tention being called to the poetic 
character of this passage, he seized 
upon it, under a seeming spirit of 
inspiration, and wrote the music in 
which the words are set. When his 
composition was submitted to the 
music-publishing house in Boston, 
they asked him, by letter, where he 
found those beautiful passages of 
scripture. 

I may say that in this anthem 
there is a concentrated expression 
of the great and true principles and 
message of God in the great last 
and new dispensation. There are 
two parts, the first of which is ren- 
dered in a solo ; the second part as 
the chorus. The first part is recita- 
tive in its nature, and comes at the 
close of a solemn declaration of the 
Lord to the effect that those who re- 
ject His servants reject Him. And 
now the words of the anthem : ( See 
Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 84, 
verses 99 to 102). 

The choir then rendered, in splen- 
did style, the anthem referred to, 
Prof. Charles R. Johnson singing 
the tenor solo parts. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I think it is generally understood, 
by the congregation, that the choir 
which has furnished us music today 
is the Brigham Young University 
Choir. Brother Anthon C. Lund 
is the leader. We feel to thank 
them for the most exquisite music 
they have furnished during the two 
sessions of this day ; and we pray 
that the Lord will bless them hence- 
forth and forever, in the good work 
that they are doing. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph R. Shepherd. 

Conference adjourned until Sun- 
clay, April 7th, at 10 a. m. 



THIRD DAY. 



In the Tabernacle. Sunday, April 
7th. 10 a. m. 

The stand was tastefully draped 
in white bunting interspersed with 
green leaves. Pots of Easter lilies 
added to ' the beauty and symbol- 
ism of the decoration. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith, and he 
announced that an overflow meeting 
will convene this morning, in the 
Assembly Hall, for the benefit of 
the many who cannot be accommo- 
dated in the overcrowded Taber- 
nacle. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
anthem "Unfold ye portals, ever- 
lasting." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. 
H. Smart. 

An Easter anthem. "Christ is Ris- 
en," words and music by Prof. Evan 
Stephens, was rendered by the 
choir ; Sister Rose Smithen and 
Brother Carl Samuelson sang the 
solos and duets. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I would like to say to the congre- 
gation that the last beautiful song 
sung by one of our sisters, and one 
of our brothers, and by the choir, 
entitled, "Christ is Risen," is the 
latest production of our own Evan 
Stephens ; but I trust it will be by 
no means the last. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

Mexico a splendid country, but its peo- 
ple unfortunate — Possible intervention 
fraught with serious consequences — 
Condition of law and reason needed to 
bring peace — Murderous opposition al- 
ways preceded civil and religious re- 
form — The Gospel of Christ a present- 
day necessity . 

On Thursday last I returned 
from Mexico, that country where 
nature has so abundantly scattered 
her bounties, but where men appear 
to so little appreciate their sur- 
roundings, and the blessings which 
might be theirs if they would only 
reach out their hands and take 
them. It is a good country, a 
country with great agricultural re- 
sources which have hardly been 
touched, a country which produces 
more silver than any other in the 
world, a country inconceivably rich 
in gold and copper, a country with 
fiifteen millions of people waiting 
for men of intelligence to estab- 
lish the mechanical and industrial 
arts under conditions which should 
be as favorable as in any other 
place in the world. The farms down 
there are not being cultivated to the 
usual extent. The railroads are 
idle; they are out of commission, 
except as they are carrying bodies 
of armed men from place to place, 
men who are engaged in mortal 
combat. Many of the mines are 
closed down, and the mills are idle. 
The workers are engaged in war in- 
stead of those pursuits of peace 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS.

which make for the betterment of 
countries and communities. 

We can hardly appreciate and 
understand it here, with our peace- 
able surroundings. It hardly seems 
possible to us that in this age of 
reason, this age of. intelligence, 
when railroads, and the telegraph 
and telephone have brought man- 
kind in all the world into such close 
association that we have become, 
to a great extent at least, or should 
have become one great family, that 
it would be possible for men — men 
of one race, professing one re- 
ligion, who ought to have but one 
general purpose — to be engaged in 
civil war,, but it is the case down 
there nevertheless. We can scarce- 
ly understand and appreciate how 
intensely we are interested in that 
struggle. There are many thou- 
sands of Americans in the Mexi- 
can republic. There are four thou- 
sand Latter-day Saints there. They 
are scattered, the Americans are, 
from Chihuahua on the north to 
Yucatan on the south. They are 
without adequate means of protec- 
tion. They own hundreds of mil- 
lions of dollars of property in that 
republic, property which has been 
purchased with good money. That 
property, too, is without adequate 
protection. So the present revolu- 
tion in Mexico has to deal with 
questions which have never existed 
in any of the many revolutions 
which have occurred in that country 
in the past ; for not only Americans 
and American interests are involv- 
ed, but the interests of other for- 
eign nations; and it goes without 
saying that unless the people of 
that country shall prove themselves 
capable of giving proper protection 
to those foreign interests which ex- 
ist that someone else must give pro- 
tection to them. 



We all know what that means. 
It means that this responsibility, 
this burden, will devolve upon the 
United States. I do not know 
whether we appreciate, or not, what 
it would mean to us should it be- 
come necessary for our government 
to assume to discharge this duty, 
this solemn responsibilty which 
rests upon it. I view such a con- 
tingency, such a possibility, with 
abhorrence. It is an easy thing for 
us to talk about intervention in 
Mexican affairs by the United 
States. It is an easy thing for us 
to say that American interests are 
not protected. It is an easy thing 
for us to talk about the protection 
that is given 'to English subjects 
and German subjects throughout 
the world and to complain, perhaps, 
that similar protection is not given 
to representatives of our govern- 
ment. We must not loose sight of 
this one fact, that intervention upon 
the part of the United States, in 
Mexican affairs, means war. War 
means that at least one hundred 
thousand men representing the flow- 
er of American manhood will be 
needed before that country could 
be pacified. It means that men from 
Washington and Oregon, from 
Montana and Idaho, from Wyom- 
ing and Utah, California, Colorado. 
Arizona, and New Mexico, this en- 
tire Pacific slope, will be inarched 
into that country ; and if they go 
many of them will never return. 
That is what we are face to face 
with today, just as near to it as it is 
possible to be without becoming in- 
volved in that struggle. I thank the 
Lord with all my heart that there 
stands at the head of this nation a 
conservative man, a careful man, a 
good man, a man of tolerance, a 
man of patience, a man who stands 
for peace and for the adjustment of 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those differences which arise be- 
tween individuals, communities and 
nations by peaceful means, by re- 
sort to reason rather than resort to 
arms. I pray God that He will so 
overrule that the United States may 
not be involved in war with Mexico 
or any other country ; and that ought 
to be the prayer of every Latter-day 
Saint ; it ought to be the prayer of 
all American men and women who 
have the welfare of their country 
and their people at heart. 

What is this trouble all about 
down there? That is what I have 
been thinking of while I have been 
away. Is there any condition in 
Mexico which might not be adjust- 
ed by resort to reason? Is there a 
condition there which might not be 
adjusted without the shedding of 
blood? Not at all. If men would 
be subject to law, if they would 
only honor, sustain, and uphold the 
wholesome and good laws which ex- 
ist in all civilized countries, it 
would not be necessary to resort to 
arms in order that the rights of 
people might be maintained. I am 
not going to discuss the responsi- 
bility for this struggle — whether it 
rests with the common people who 
have arisen almost unanimously in 
the northern part of the republic, 
and demanded social and economic 
reforms, or whether it rests with 
the administration, with the govern- 
ment of that country, which has not 
been as good to the masses as it 
might have been in the past. I 
shall not discuss this. The condi- 
tion exists. The remedy so far as 
I am able to observe, and the only 
remedy must be respect of law. 
Whenever people go outside of it, 
whenever they assume by force to 
accomplish that which thev should 
accomplish by reason and by argu- 



ment, by resort to the ballot to 
which they are entitled, they place 
themselves without the protection 
of the law ; and that is what the 
common people down there have 
done. And whenever a government 
or an administration shall assume to 
pervert the law, shall entrench 
'itself with power, and disregard 
the cries of the masses it can- 
not expect but that confusion will 
result. 

• So there is a great problem being 
worked out down there. The end 
no man can tell. I have been won- 
dering since I have been there 
whether we are any better prepared 
in this twentieth century to adjust 
the differences which arise between 
men, between individuals and com- 
munities and nations, by reason, 
than we have been in the past. We 
ought to be ; I hope that we are ; 
but I tell you in reviewing condi- 
tions as they exist in the world, it 
appears to me that we have very 
much yet to learn. I do not re- 
member in the history of the w6rld 
any civil reform that has ever come 
to it that has not been established 
by force of arms. I do not remem- 
ber an instance where a king or a 
dynasty, a power that has become 
established and has entrenched it- 
self with armies and navies has 
ever yielded it up except by force 
of arms. It was the case in Eng- 
land. King John would never have 
yielded to the demands of the 
barons at Runnymecle, and given 
us that great fundamental charta of 
English liberty, had he not been 
forced to do it ; and yet the demand 
was only a reasonable one. The 
French revolution with all its hor- 
rors, its injustice, and the barbarous 
things which characterized it, never- 
theless, made for the betterment of 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 



63 



the French people. German liberty 
was only acquired at the expense of 
the shedding of blood. Here in our 
own country, notwithstanding the 
fact that we demanded of England 
only that which was justly ours, 
only to be properly represented, 
that we might have an equal voice 
in government, as we bore an equal 
proportion of the burdens of gov-' 
ernment, they turned a deaf ear to 
our prayers. That right had to be 
established and maintained by force 
of arms. It seems to me that it 
might have been avoided. It seems 
to me that the harmony of the race 
might have been maintained, a 
great confederation established by 
which the rights of all would have 
been recognized, every man, every 
division, every part of the English 
empire granted the rights and priv- 
ileges which belonged to it, with- 
out the shedding of blood, could 
reason have prevailed. I have 
never believed that the great civil 
war — the most disastrous war that 
this republic has ever known — was 
a necessity. I have felt that great 
responsibility rests with someone, 
those people who broke away from 
the confederation of states, who in- 
cited the animosity, the anger of the 
South against the North, and the 
North against the South, until the 
country was involved in civil war. 
I have thought that it might have 
been avoided, that the emancipation 
of the slaves could have been ac- 
complished — I do not suppose there 
is a man in America today who will 
not admit that that was a proper 
thing to do, an act of justice to that 
race and people — by those pacific 
means which were recommended 
first, so far as I am aware, by the 
founder of this Church. I believe 
that it was possible. 



Just the same with religious re- 
forms. My brethren and sisters, I 
know of no religious reformer who 
has ever come into the world, de- 
manding the most simple justice, 
demanding only that which was 
right, that which would improve the 
condition of human kind, that has 
not been persecuted that has not 
been killed. It was so with the 
Savior of the world, and yet we 
know that He advocated righteous- 
ness ; but the fact was, and is to- 
day, people become so committed 
to existing things that they are ex- 
ceedingly reluctant to accept any- 
thing which comes in contact with 
their preconceived ideas of right 
and wrong. So the Jews refused to 
accept Christ as the Savior of 
the world. They rejected His doc- 
trine ; they persecuted and crucified 
Him. Then, after a while, from 
the Church which He established, 
there evolved another system of re- 
ligion, taking upon it the name of 
Christ, but in reality being anti- 
Christ, for it failed in all those 
things which He essayed to do, and 
did the very things which He op- 
posed and condemned as wrong. 
The inquisition came ; men were 
not permitted to worship God ac- 
cording to the dictates of their own 
conscience. The Duke of Alva 
went over into Holland and slew 
those people by thousands. Why? 
Had they done anything wrong? 
No ; they only desired to worship 
the Lord as they saw fit ; they only 
claimed the right to separate 
themselves from the Catholic 
church ; but the church refused to 
admit it. If they had been gov- 
erned by reason, and by those uni- 
versal laws which guarantee to men 
the right to do as they please, so 
long as they do not in any way con- 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rlict with or infringe upon the 
rights of their fellows — that was all 
those Hollanders asked; but they 
were not to be left to do that in 
peace. So in France, the massacre 
of the Protestants there, and the 
persecutions of the early Protestant 
church in England ; I cannot think 
of an instance — why, they would 
not even allow Quakers to unite to- 
gether for peace, and in opposition 
to war, without persecution. They 
put them to death ; they buried 
them alive, and those Quakers stood 
there and permitted their bodies td 
be buried, without resistance. And 
that was done in the name of jus- 
tice ! 

The Bible could not be published 
and circulated among English peo- 
ple that they might become familiar 
with the word of the Lord, with- 
out opposition ; and that opposition 
came, mind you, from the organized 
government itself. The only ac- 
cusation made against John Wy- 
cliffe was that he desired to make 
the Bible as common to the people 
of England as it was wont to be to 
learned men and clerks ; and for 
this, when the old man finally died, 
they took his body, heaped indigni- 
ties upon it, burned ' it, and scat- 
tered the ashes abroad, that they 
might obliterate, as far as possible, 
his memory. And that was his only 
offense — he desired that the people 
might know the will of God by 
being made familiar with His word 
as it was contained in the Holy 
Scriptures. They did worse than 
that with Tyndale. After printing 
was invented, and he began the 
publication of the Bible, he was 
burned at the stake as a heretic ; 
his last words were, "Oh, Lord, 
open the eyes of the King of Eng- 
land." There was no offense in 



him ; he only advocated righteous- 
ness ; he only stood there in the in- 
terest of the King of England and 
his people ; and yet that king con- 
sented to his death. Almost a par- 
allel of the words of the Savior of 
the world when He prayed that His 
Father might forgive them because 
they knew not what they did. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
that brings me down to another 
epoch in history, an epoch that will 
take its place, too, with others of 
the most important epochs that 
have marked the history of this 
world. The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was organized. 
The doctrines of the Gospel of 
Christ were promulgated. Joseph 
Smith declared to the world that in 
vision he had seen the Father and 
the Son. Was it an offense against 
the law ? Was it an offense against 
morality? Was it not a thing that 
the world should have hailed with 
gladness and rejoicing, that in the 
dispensation in which we live our 
Father had been so merciful as to 
reveal Himself again to man, and 
that the voice of Christ, our Sa- 
vior, had been heard, bearing wit- 
ness to the fact that His kingdom 
and coming were at hand, and re- 
vealing again, through holy mes- 
sengers sent from the courts on 
high to us, the fullness of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. What does it teach ? 
what did Joseph Smith advocate? 
Study the doctrines that he taught, 
carefully, and you will find that 
they all make for the uplift of 
the human family — they are the 
doctrines taught by the Savior of 
the world, in their simplicity, in 
plainness, that man might under- 
stand them. The world would not 
accept it any more than they have 
accepted other reforms. They were 



ELDER ANTHONY IV. 1VINS. 



6r> 



converted to their traditions ; they 
were committed to existing condi- 
tions just as the Jews were. They 
could not be moved from their 
prejudice, their bigotry, their illib- 
erality. They would not yield; 
they opposed the truth ; they per- 
secuted the Saints, and took the life 
of the prophet of the Lord. He 
went to his death just as William 
Tyndale went; just as Christ had 
gone — with a conscience void of of- 
fense towards God and all men ; he 
knew that his garments were clean, 
that he had stood for that which 
was right, even though the world 
rejected it. 

Now, what remedy have I to sug- 
gest for this condition of confu- 
sion that exists in the world — for 
it is not only in Mexico; there is 
war in northern Africa; there is 
war in China ; hundreds of thou- 
sands of men are engaged in al- 
most a life and death struggle in 
England. In British Columbia to- 
day thousands of industrial workers 
are in open rebellion against ex- 
isting conditions. In our own coun- 
try we have been upon the verge 
of one of the greatest industrial 
strikes that the country has ever 
known. England is building war- 
ships in order that she may be pre- 
pared for eventualities that may 
occur, in the fear of war with Ger- 
many. There is confusion in the 
world — my brethren and sisters. If 
you will read the twenty-fourth 
chapter of the Gospel as it was 
written by Matthew, you will find 
the words of our Savior verified, 
that the signs of His kingdom and 
coming appear, that the confusion 
which He predicted, the wars and 
rumors of wars are here. The rea- 
son for it all is that men refuse to 
be governed by law, by reason, and 



by argument. There is just one 
remedy for this condition, in my 
opinion. These people are religious 
people. You may say that to con- 
vert them to Christianity will cure 
all of these evils. There is no peo- 
ple professing greater Christianity 
than the German people, or the 
English people. There are no peo- 
ple in the world who are more de- 
votedly attached to the Christian 
religion, so-called, than these people 
down in Mexico. But it does not 
prevent war. It does not prevent 
confusion ; it does not adjust those 
great religious and industrial prob- 
lems which are before the world 
and which must be solved. We can 
not brush them aside ; they are 
here ; they are here demanding solu- 
tion. The people in their ignorance 
and in their darkness are seeking 
to solve them by means which must 
inevitably fail. Socialism cannot 
do it ; anarchy cannot do it ; resort 
to force cannot do it. Just one 
thing, and that is repentance on 
the part of the people who make 
up the inhabitants of this earth ; 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ ; con- 
version to these righteous principles 
which He taught, by which the rich 
are lead to respect the rights of the 
poor, and the poor to respect the 
rights of the rich, those doctrines 
which make us one in that univer- 
sal brotherhood which would come 
to us were the Gospel of Our Lord 
Jesus Christ accepted by the people 
of the world ; and to teach this is 
our mission. 

Do you suppose there could be 
war among Latter-day Saints? Do 
you, my brethren and sisters, who 
are here this afternoon, want to go 
out and kill anybody? No. no; in 
your hearts you abhor the thought. 
You live for peace ; you advocate

peace; you abide by the law; you 
yield to it and to its demands; and 
if the law is not adequate, if the 
law is not sufficient, you know that 
you have it in your own power to 
correct and amend it until provision 
shall be made which will meet every 
just requirement of the human 
heart. I do not believe that it can 
ever be accomplished, I do not look 
for peace, I do not look for har- 
mony, I do not expect that men will 
sheath their swords and live in love 
together, that the millennium, the 
thousand years of peace, will be es- 
tablished until the people of the 
world are converted to the truths 
of the everlasting Gospel of our 
Redeemer. The mission to so con- 
vert them rests with the Latter-day 
Saints, and we are discharging that 
responsibility as well as we can, 
under the circumstances by which 
we are surrounded. 

My brethren and sisters, think of 
these things. Let us more fully 
appreciate them. Let us thank God 
for the tolerance of this government 
of ours. Let us thank the Lord 
that if our rights are not maintained 
as we think they ought to be, 
among other nations, if our govern- 
ment does not act, perhaps, just as 
promptly as we think it should do, 
that it is not because it lacks 
strength ; it is not because it lacks 
courage ; it is not because it lacks 
disposition, but it is because of the 
fact that, recognizing the rights of 
other people as well as the rights of 
its own citizens, it seeks constantly 
to keep within the law, that it may 
be absolutely justified in that which 
it does. Let us pray for peace. Let 
us pray for the maintenance of law 
and order, for without it anarchy 
will come ; it will come to us when- 
ever we go away from those safe- 



guards, those guarantees which are 
the fundamental laws of this coun- 
try of ours. We cannot afford to 
do it ; it means confusion ; it means 
anarchy; it means that the red flag 
will be carried just as it is being 
carried in Mexico now — wherever 
people shall assume supremacy over 
the law, instead of yielding obedi- 
ence to it. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters. Let us all pray for 
peace. Let us advocate peace. May 
we never forget that song which 
was sung at Bethlehem of Judea, 
when Christ was born into the 
world, the song sung by the angels 
of God : "Peace on earth, good will 
to men." I trust that the Latter- 
day Saints may be among the fore- 
most in maintaining it, standing for 
law, standing for order, conserva- 
ive, careful, trusting in the Lord. 
I could not help but contrast the at- 
titude of the Latter-day Saints with 
that of other people, when President 
Taft's proclamation was issued, ad- 
vising Americans to come out of 
Mexico, who were exposed to dan- 
ger. There was a stampede down 
there; many American interests 
were abandoned ; houses were lock- 
ed up; property left; men and 
women came in train loads to the 
United States. I went down to 
that community of Latter-day 
Saints, in the very war zone, ex- 
posed to danger every moment of 
the day and night,, not knowing 
when trouble might come. There 
I found the spirit of serenity, the 
spirit of peace, reliance upon God, 
reliance upon the law, demanding 
—although there was very little of 
legal authority to appeal to— the 
rights which belong to us and noth- 
ing more. It reflected the spirit of 
the Latter-day Saints, the spirit of 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

this work. It reflected the courage 
that men and women have who rely 
upon God rather than upon their 
own strength. 

May the Lord bless you, and bless 
all the Latter-day Saints, and bless 
this nation ; and may He turn away 
these clouds of war which are hov- 
ering over us, that peace may pre- 
vail, I pray, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

Absolute certainty of resurrection of the 
Savior. — The Gospel applicable to all, 
living and dead. — Genealogical Society 
a Church organization; membership

"Remember the worth of souls is great 
in the sight of God ; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer 
suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he 
suffered the pain of all men that all 
men might repent and come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the 
dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on condition of repentance; 

"And how great is his joy in the soul 
that repenteth. 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry re- 
pentance unto this people; 

"And if it so be that you should labor 
all your days in crying repentance unto 
this people, and bring, save it be one 
soul unto me, how great shall be your 
joy with him in the kingdom of my 
Father ! 

"And now, if your joy will be great 
with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, 
how great will be your joy if you bring 
many souls unto me." 

These words were delivered to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, through 
revelation from the Lord. Through- 
out the Christian world, this morn- 
ing, the people are celebrating the 



anniversary of the resurrection of 
the Son of God. Many who have 
assembled to do homage unto Him 
do not accept Him as the Redeemer 
of the world ; but with us there is 
no reservation ; He is indeed the on- 
ly begotten Son of God, and through 
His grace, and the grace of His 
Father, hath redeemed us from sin 
on condition of our repentance. We 
know that He has risen from the 
dead, that He has ascended on high, 
taking captivity captive, and has be- 
come the author of salvation unto 
all who will believe, who will repent 
of their sins and accept Him as the 
Redeemer of the world. Latter- 
day Saints are not left in doubt re- 
garding these things. 

There were many witnesses who 
testified of the resurrection of the 
Savior at the time He came forth 
from the dead. He appeared first 
unto Mary at the tomb, later unto 
the twelve, or to the eleven, one 
of them having lost his apostleship, 
and afterwards unto a multitude 
of the saints. He labored among 
His disciples for some time, con- 
firming their faith and strengthen- 
ing them in the gospel of which He 
is the author. Of this they have 
borne record and have given their 
testimony to the world. But after 
the falling away from the truth, 
the world was in darkness, and 
without living witnesses of the res- 
urrection of Christ until the restor- 
ation of the gospel in the dispensa- 
tion of the fullness of times. At 
the present time upon the face of 
the earth there are many who can 
testify that Jesus is the Christ, for 
the Spirit of God has revealed unto 
them this truth ; and no man can 
know that Jesus is the Christ unless 
the Holy Spirit reveal it unto him. 
The prophet Joseph Smith- was 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



raised up as a witness of the res- 
urrection of Christ, and was given 
power and authority to institute His 
gospel anew among the children of 
men. Others, also, beheld Him, in 
our own generation, conversed with 
Him, and were instructed by Him 
and were taught the principles of 
truth which make us free They 
also have borne record to the world 
of these things. We know that 
He hath risen from the dead, that 
He might bring all men unto Him, 
on conditions of repentance — for no 
man can be saved fn the kingdom 
of our Father unless he abides by 
the laws of the kingdom. 

The laws of that kingdom are 
that a man must believe ; he must 
have faith in the Lord ; he must re- 
pent of his sins ; he must receive a 
remission of sins through the water 
of baptism, and have hands laid 
upon his head for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, by one who is em- 
powered, having authority to offi- 
ciate in these ordinances and then 
he must endure to the end, keeping 
the laws and the commandments 
given unto us by our Heavenly 
Father, otherwise he will lose his 
reward. Faith is not enough to 
save us. Our faith must be cou- 
pled with works, with good deeds, 
with a prayerful heart, and with 
the desire to magnify our callings 
before the Lord, laboring diligently 
all the days of our lives for the 
benefit of our fellow-men, bringing 
them unto repentance. 

I have read unto you that the 
worth of souls is great in the sight 
of our Heavenly Father; and that 
our mission to the world is one 
calling them unto repentance. We 
call upon mankind to receive the 
Savior, to accept Jesus as the Re- 
deemer of the world, to believe in 



His gospel as it has been revealed 
anew, with the same ordinances, 
the same powers and privileges 
which were taught by the Master 
and made manifest during His min- 
istry in the earth. And this does 
not mean that salvation is confined 
solely unto those who hear the 
preaching of the gospel among the 
nations of the earth ; for our Father 
in heaven shall save all the work- 
manship of His hands, on these 
conditions which have been made, 
whether they be living, or whether 
they be dead. Our mission is two- 
fold, to save all the living who will 
believe, and to warn all who reject 
the truth ; that they may be left 
without excuse and to redeem the 
dead from their sins, or at least 
put the means within their hands, 
which were denied them in this life 
and of which they can partake in 
the spirit, that they also might re- 
ceive salvation as well as we. The 
Lord has established among us tem- 
ples where ordinances for the dead 
may be performed, and has em- 
powered us that we might become 
saviors on Mt. Zion, and assist in 
our weak way in redeeming those 
who have died without a knowledge 
of the truth, or without the privilege 
of accepting it while they lived on 
the earth. This is in fact the great- 
est responsibility that has been 
placed upon us. 

Jn the year 1894, President Wil- 
ford Woodruff and the leading 
brethren, under his direction and 
inspiration, organized in this Church 
a society to further the salva- 
tion of the dead; and they called 
upon the people, members of .the 
Church, to become active in this 
organization. For it was organized 
with the idea in view of gathering 
together the records of the dead, 



ELDER JOSEPH P. SMITH, JR.

that they might be filed in a safe 
place for the benefit of the mem- 
bers of the Church, where they 
could have access to them, obtain 
the names of their dead, and go to 
the house of the Lord and there 
be baptized for them vicariously ; 
for the Lord will accept, at our 
hands baptism in behalf of the 
dead, and we may, by perform- 
ing this labor, open the doors 
unto those who are in the prison 
house, that they may come forth 
and be redeemed on like conditions 
with which we expect to receive 
salvation. We send our elders into 
the world to preach the gospel. We 
keep somewhere near two thou- 
sand of them in the various nations 
constantly. We never hear the 
question raised, when a man is sent 
to preach the gospel into some dis- 
tant part of the earth, that it is 
useless for him to go there to 
preach, because his relatives did not 
come from there, and no benefit 
could possibly accrue to him 
through preaching the gospel among 
those who are strangers or aliens, 
so far as his immediate kindred 
were concerned. We go where we 
are sent; we preach the gospel, get 
the Spirit of the Lord, and rejoice 
in a testimony of this revealed re- 
ligion which we have received, 
knowing that we are doing the 
Lord's will, and that we will be 
blessed for our labors without re- 
gard to whether we have been la- 
boring among our own kindred or 
among the nations from whence our 
people did not come. We nev- 
er raise that question. Strange 
to say, however, when we ap- 
peal to some of our brethren 
and sisters to join this society, who 
ought to have within their hearts 
the love of their departed ones, and 



who should be possessed of the spir- 
it that was promised when the Lord 
sent Elijah to restore the keys of 
his Priesthood to the earth, it is 
astonishing to find that they will 
raise the question : "What good will 
it do me to become a member of 
this society?" And they will say, 
"I do not know anything of my 
ancestors, and the records in your 
library will not help me." Or, "the 
work for our family is done so far 
as we are able to discover their 
names, and there is nothing new 
that we can gain from your books." 
Yet this is just as much an organi- 
zation of the Church, and just as 
important and far reaching in 
its results, as the Mutual Im- 
provement Associations, the Sun- 
day Schools, the Relief Socie- 
ties or any other auxiliary or- 
ganization. I have a letter in my 
pocket received from a good broth- 
er who is representing this society, 
The Genealogical Society of Utah, 
in which he says that he had ap- 
proached one of the leading breth- 
ren in his stake and wanted to know 
if he was not going to renew his 
membership in the Genealogical 
Society. This brother answered, 
No, for he had been to the library, 
had examined the books, and there 
was nothing there that would bene- 
fit him. He had not enough inter- 
est apparently in the salvation of 
the children of men to give his 
fee for membership and continue 
his activity in this organization, 
though perhaps the fee paid by 
him would be the means of purchas- 
ing some record that would contain 
the names of the dead that did be- 
long to someone who was a member 
of the Church, and who did have 
faith enough to go to the house of 
the Lord and perform the ordin-

ances necessary for their salvation. 
But simply because there was no 
direct benefit in it for him, or sim- 
ply because he could not locate his 
immediate relatives, he had no in- 
terest in the organization. Suppose 
we took this stand in the preaching 
of the gospel to the world, and felt 
so selfish and narrow that we would 
do nothing for the salvation of any 
save it be those of our own blood. 
What would become of the work? 
Was that the spirit of Christ? No; 
He came into the world to redeem 
the world from sin, and took upon 
Him the sins of all men, that they 
might not suffer if they would re- 
pent ; and He never raised the ques- 
tion whether or not they were blood 
relatives. His idea was to fulfill 
the will of His Father, and because 
of the love He had in His heart 
for the children of His Father — 
and we are all brethren and sisters ; 
we are all descendants from one 
head ; in the broadest sense we are 
all blood kin — He did not question 
whether or not His mission would 
mean merely the redemption of 
those who were His immediate fol- 
lowers or those of His own house. 
Why, it was those of His own 
house that rejected Him. He came 
not only to save them, but He came 
and took upon Him the sins of all 
men. We ought to be broad minded 
enough and appreciate sufficiently 
that which was accomplished in our 
behalf by the Son of God, that we 
would be willing to do something 
also for the benefit of the human 
race, whether we can trace our 
genealogy back or not. 

T speak as I have by request, and 
also by authority. I trust that the 
Latter-day Saints will get the spirit 
of this latter-day work and will la- 
bor not only for their own salvation 



but also for the salvation of all the 
children of our Father, no matter 
where they come from — whether it 
is from the nations of Europe, from 
the islands of the sea, or any other 
place. I trust that we will have en- 
ough love for the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, enough appreciation for the 
great atonement that was made for 
us, and sufficient love in our hearts 
for our fellowmen that we will de- 
sire their salvation as well as our 
own. The first great commandment 
unto us is that we should love the 
Lord our God with all our hearts ; 
and the second is like unto it, that 
we should love our neighbor as our- 
selves. We desire that the Latter- 
day Saints will get the spirit of. 
salvation for the dead, that they 
will become members of this great 
organization, which was instituted 
in behalf of the dead, that salvation 
may come unto the countless mil- 
lions who are now waiting for us 
to perform these labors that they 
might escape from the prison house 
and rejoice in a testimony of the 
truth and in the knowledge of their 
redemption from hell, and the 
grave. Our mission is one of love, 
of mercy; it is unto all the world, 
not unto a select few ; and we 
should labor with all" our mights 
for the salvation of souls, for great 
shall be our joy, in the kingdom of 
our Father, with those whom we 
may, perhaps, have been instru- 
mental in converting, or may have 
aided, in obtaining the means of 
escape from the consequences of 
their sins through becoming saviors 
unto them on Mount Zion. 

May we love the truth, my breth- 
ren and sisters, and not be narrow, 
not be selfish, not look for worldly 
gain, but take the broader view, and 
labor for the salvation of souls, and 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS.

assist in this mighty work which 
has been instituted by our Father, 
that all who are worthy of salvation 
may in the due time of the Lord 
receive it, and rejoice, as we expect 
to rejoice, in the salvation which 
will come to us through keeping the 
commandments of the Lord. 

The Lord bless the Latter-day 
Saints, guide and protect them, give 
them courage to resist and over- 
come the world, and do all things 
in righteousness required of them, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of Southern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I shall 
be very grateful unto you if you 
will give me an interest in your faith 
and prayers. I desire, in my re- 
marks, to be in harmony with the 
spirit that has characterized and 
dictated the remarks of the brethren 
who have preceded me. I feel in 
my heart that we should be a 
thankful people. One great writer 
said, "Oh, Lord, that lends me life, 
lend me a heart replete with thank- 
fulness." The Apostle Paul, speak- 
ing to the Corinthian Saints said, 
"For ye know the grace of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, that, though He was 
rich, yet for your sakes He became 
poor, that we through His poverty 
might be rich." The same great 
truth is expressed in the Book of 
Mormon, wherein it is said that 
the Creator suffered Himself to 
become subject unto men in the 
flesh, and died for all men, so that 
men might become subject unto 
Him. This is the Lord's way of doing 



these things. Consider the history 
of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, 
the history of Nephi of old, the his- 
tory of Joseph Smith the prophet 
of God — the lives, the experiences 
through which these men passed, 
demonstrate the truth of Paul's 
declaration that througli much trib- 
ulation we enter into the Kingdom 
of God. The leaders of this Church 
have been persecuted; they have 
been vilified ; the Church itself has 
been traduced; its doctrines have 
been misrepresented ; it has passed 
through much tribulation. But it is 
stronger today than it was yester- 
day. It will be stronger tomorrow 
than it is today. It will continue 
to grow in power, in strength, and 
in glory until all mankind shall be 
subject, not unto man, but unto the 
glory, the majesty, and the right- 
eousness of God. We do not seek 
earthly dominion, but we do seek, 
we do hunger, we do yearn, for the 
souls of men, that they might be 
saved through Jesus Christ, and find 
that freedom, that liberty, that bless- 
ing,- that comes through obedience 
to the commandments of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

The preaching of the Gospel, as 
remarked by Brother Whitney, yes- 
terday, is done in the spirit of tes- 
timony. I know that the sectarian 
world has sneered at what they were 
pleased to call our "uneducated min- 
istry;" but I do not read in the 
Scripture, or in the Word of God 
that has been revealed to us in this 
day, that men are to be converted 
purely and solely by eloquence ; but 
I understand that men are to be 
brought to God, as Zechariah said, 
"Not by might, nor by power, but by 
my Spirit, saith tne Lord." The 
Gospel, which is to be preached by 
testimony, should be attended, Jesus

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



said, by the spirit of prophecy and 
revelation, and when men speak un- 
der this power their words go 
to the hearts of the children of men ; 
and thus are men brought unto God. 
There is a great movement in the 
world today called "The men and 
religion forward movement." Men 
are beginning to realize that the 
pastors of the churches are unequal 
to the occasion of converting the 
people, and they are seeking to en- 
list the men, the laymen of the 
churches, in carrying the Gospel 
to the world. In this they are but 
following the example this 
Church has set. For, be it known 
to all men, that this Church does not 
follow ; it leads. It is the Church 
of Christ; it is the ensample, the 
standard, and it is bringing men into 
the path marked by our Lord. It 
is showing the correct manner, the 
most effective manner of preaching 
the Gospel. Take our young men 
that go into the world. They hold 
the Holy Priesthood. They learn 
to do by doing. They have an in- 
terest in this work. They believe in 
God ; they are ministers of Jesus 
Christ ; and, armed with this power, 
they go forth and are interested in 
the work ; and they accomplish a 
marvelous work and a wonder, by 
the blessings of Almighty God. 

Oh, my brethren and sisters, look 
upon the condition of the world 
with respect to religious beliefs. 
What a splendid testimony it af- 
fords that Joseph Smith was indeed 
a prophet of God. Look at -the 
doctrines that are rapidly passing 
away. Joseph Smith declared that 
he would break down superstition 
— not by an army, not by might, 
but by preaching the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. Great men have 



risen who have posed as infidels, 
and they have sought to break down 
Christianity, without giving any- 
thing as good in its place. But 
Joseph Smith did not do this ; he 
sought to break down superstition, 
and succeeded by giving to men, in 
place of their erroneous beliefs, the 
pure Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ ; and the superstition which 
has tyrannized over men — the false 
doctrine that there is no hope be- 
yond the grave, the false doctrine 
that infants are consigned to eternal 
punishment because they are not 
baptized — I say such superstition is 
passing away from the minds of 
men ; and it is due to the Gospel 
revealed by the Almighty to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Doctrines 
to which the world has been dead 
for ages have come to light, 
through the preaching of this Gos- 
pel, and men are accepting them. 
Where did Joseph Smith get his 
power? From God, and God alone. 
He came with a message from God 
upon his lips, and the grandeur of 
this work, its glory, its increasing 
power proclaim with a voice that is 
being heard by all mankind that the 
martyr, Joseph Smith, because of 
the greatness of this work, is 
mightier in death than he was in 
life. For the work is greater than 
men and will continue to grow and 
prosper. The poet said: 

"The dead have been awakened — Shall 
I sleep? 

The world's at war with tyrants — 

Shall I crouch? 
The harvest's ripe ; and I pause to reap ; 
I slumber not. A thorn is in my 

couch. 

Each day a trumpet soundeth in my 

ear, 

Its echo in my heart." 
Upon the tablets of the hearts of 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING 



the Latter-day Saints may there be 
written the glorious declaration of 
the Lord Jesus — "I must be about 
my Father's business," is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

In order to extend greater privi- 
leges to our young men who may 
be called to go on missions, to pre- 
pare themselves to some extent by 
the study of the first principles of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, a school 
of correspondence has been estab- 
lished, and Bishop Edwin S. Sheets 
has been appointed as the principal 
of this school, whose office is at 
the Bishop's Building, 40 North 
Main Street in this city. We would 
like the presidents of stakes and 
the bishops of wards to encourage 
their young men, and such of the 
young sisters who may be called up- 
on hereafter to take missions 
abroad, to open a correspondence 
with Brother Sheets, that they may 
in that manner prepare themselves 
to some extent for missionary labor 
in the fields abroad. This, of course, 
applies to those who are not able to 
spend the time needed to go to the 
church schools and there take a 
regular course in missionary work. 
This correspondence course is for 
those who cannot spare the time, 
to go to school and who may use 
this privilege and opportunity to 
gain information by means of cor- 
respondence. In this way many 
of our brethern will find themselves 
much better prepared to go on mis- 
sions than they would be if they 
were called without this preliminary 
investigation and preparation.

direction of David J. Watts, ren- 
dered the musical exercises. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

My God, the spring of all my joys, 

The life of my delights, 
The glory of my brightest days, 

And comfort of my nights ! 

Prayer was offered by Elder Jo- 
seph A. Buttle. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

He died ! the Great Redeemer died, 
And Israel's daughters wept around; 

A solemn darkness veiled the sky, 
A sudden trembling shook the ground. 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING. 

(President of Bear River Stake.) 

I am sure that the sweet influ- 
ences of the Spirit of our Father in 
heaven which has attended the pre- 
vious meetings of this great Confer- 
ence of the Church has been a 
source of inspiration, satisfaction, 
and pleasure to all of the Latter-day 
Saints who have attended the meet- 
ings. I eranestly trust and pray 
that, during this service of the Con- 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ference, the blessings of the Spirit 
of the Lord will attend us, as asked 
for by the brother who opened this 
meeting. I am very sure that not 
anybody here could feel more keenly 
the need of the inspiration of the 
Lord than I particularly feel at this 
time, and I pray that nothing I 
may say will in any way detract 
from the blessings that we have al- 
ready received during the different 
sessions of this Conference. 

The Lord has been very good to 
His people in placing in their midst 
inspired men, to direct and teach 
them the principles of the Gospel 
of Christ. I do not believe that any 
people in the world's history have 
ever been more favored with the 
personal ministry of men inspired of 
the Lord than are the Latter-day 
Saints. When I coniemplate that 
truth, it is not a surprising thing to 
me that many thousands leave their 
work, semi-annually, to come up 
here to the center stake of Zion and 
partake of the influence of these 
teachings. I have great satisfaction 
in the fact that we have these men 
in the Church to instruct us. I hope 
that the teachings we receive at this 
Conference will be taken to heart 
by us. I believe that if we follow 
their instruction, and accept their 
testimony, we will become the great- 
est people upon the face of the 
whole earth ; such is our destiny. 

I have the honor to preside over 
one of the stakes of Zion, and I 
know that we out there in our 
homes appreciate the ministry and 
the blessings of these brethren of 
the General Authorities of the 
Church, who come to teach us from 
time to time. I appreciate the op- 
portunity of standing here for a few 
moments this morning as the repre- 
sentative of near thirty-five hundred 



Latter-day Saints who live in the 
Bear River Stake of Zion. I believe 
that they are a good people, and 
that they are striving to serve the 
Lord. 

We have in our stake sought, 
during the last year or two, to em- 
phasize the value of personal minis- 
try of the ward teachers in the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints, and 
I want to bear my humble testimony 
to you that I believe there is no 
influence in the Church today that 
is more potent for the good of the 
Latter-day Saints than the regular 
visits of the teachers into their 
homes from month to month. We 
have found that to be true in our 
stake of Zion. The wards in which 
the homes have been properly vis- 
ited by the teachers from month 
to month are the wards that are 
giving us the very best results. 
They are the wards that furnish 
the largest proportion of brethren 
and sisters to partake of the Sacra- 
ment regularly upon the Sabbath 
day. I testify to you, particularly 
you that are engaged in this teach- 
ers' work, that there is no greater 
calling in the Church today than 
that embracing the obligation and 
opportunity of entering the homes 
of Latter-day Saints and teaching 
them the principles of the everlast- 
ing Gospel. More than 85 per cent 
of the Latter-day Saints in my stake 
of Zion are visited regularly each 
month in their homes. We have 
maintained that record for a year 
past, and I do not believe there is 
a single phase of our religious ac- 
tivity that has not been benefited, 
augmented, and strengthened by 
the visits of these brethren in the 
homes of the people. 

President Lyman was in attend- 
ance at our conference, three or 



ELDER MILTON H. WELLING. 



75 



four weeks ago, and he asked what 
the results of this labor were in 
the homes and in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints. He asked if we 
were going to the people simply for 
the purpose of making a record of 
having so visited them ; or whether 
our visits were accomplishing any- 
thing that was worth while. He 
wanted to know if we were causing 
the people to pray in their families, 
or causing any other uplifting in- 
fluences to be manifest in their 
lives. I promised President Lyman, 
when he left us, that we would 
inquire of the Latter-day Saints 
in our stake how many of them 
were prayerful in their homes, and 
I brought down to him the informa- 
tion, last Saturday, that of the 3,500 
people in the Bear Lake Stake of 
Zion, more than 72 per cent had 
family prayers in their homes regu- 
larly. I take it, my brethren and 
sisters, that this is a fair average. 
I hope that all of the Church is ob- 
serving that great law as faithful- 
ly or more faithfully than we are 
doing there. We went into the 
homes of all the people, and where 
we ascertained that they did not 
pray, the teachers are trying to get 
them to pray. Where they did not 
attend the Sacrament meetings, our 
brethren are inviting them to come 
to these meetings, and we are 
teaching them the obligation that 
rests upon Latter-day Saints to 
meet together often to partake of 
the Lord's supper, and renew their 
covenants with their Father in 
heaven. 

I have great pleasure in saying 
that this work in our stake of Zion 
has given us the satisfaction of 
feeling in our hearts that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are living today more 
nearly up to the principles of the 



Gospel of Christ than they were 
living yesterday. The testimony 
of the brethren who have spoken 
previously in the Conference, the 
testimony of President Smith at the 
opening of the Conference, that the 
Latter-day Saints were better or- 
ganized, and were better disciplined 
today in the principles of the Gos- 
pel of Christ, in the principles of 
right living — for this is what I 
esteem the Gospel of Christ to be — 
that they were better prepared to 
cope with the adversary than they 
had ever been in the history of the 
Church, that testimony found a re- 
sponsive echo in my heart. I do 
believe that the Latter-day Saints 
are living their religion today as 
well as they ever did before. I do 
believe that the young men of Israel 
will be faithful to the teachings 
and the testimony of their fathers. 
When I think of the trials, when I 
think of the hardships that my 
father and my mother endured, that 
my feet might be firmly established 
here in the tops of the mountains, I 
feel that no disgrace could come to 
me so distressing in its nature as to 
reject their testimony, and I believe 
that spirit and feeling very largely 
predominates in the hearts of the 
young men of Israel today. 

We get a testimony of the truth 
in the mission field, when we come 
in contact with conditions as they 
exist in the world. We then feel 
the need of drawing near to our 
Father in heaven. The army of 
faithful men that are coming back 
from the various missionary fields 
today are a continual source of in- 
spiration to the Latter-day Saints 
who are at home. Our mothers are 
praying for these boys who are out 
in the world, and they obtain for 
themselves a testimony that the 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I am 
glad, as Brother Whitney said in 
the Conference yesterday, that these 
boys are teaching the Gospel 
through the power of example, and 
through the power of their simple 
testimonies. I believe that it has 
always been preached most effect- 
ually in that way. I believe that 
the Prophet Joseph Smith con- 
vinced the people of his day by the 
power of his simple declaration and 
testimony. All the leaders of this 
Church have taught it to us more in 
that fashion than in any other way 
up to this time. Our boys are sim- 
ply following the dictates and 
promptings of the Spirit of God, 
when they go into the missionary 
field and declare the truth of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
without the spirit of controversy, 
but simply having a desire to pro- 
claim the truths of the Gospel. 

I know that the Gospel is true. 
I know that it has been restored to 
the earth for the salvation of the 
souls of the children of men. If 
the young men of Israel reject this 
truth and turn away from the tes- 
timony of their fathers, nothing 
can come into their lives that would 
more disgrace or dishonor their 
name or their memory. I testify 
that those who lead the Church, and 
those who go out into the different 
stakes of Zion to teach the Gospel 
to the people, are servants of the 
Lord. I never feel when they come 
to our stake but that they have 
brought to us the things 
that we have most needed 
for the particular occasion, 
and I am sure that is the ex- 
perience of the Latter-day Saints 
who are here this morning. The 
thought that is in your heart is 
answered, and you are filled with a 



spirit of rejoicing and thanksgiv- 
ing when these brethren visit you 
in your homes in the different 
stakes of Zion ; that also has always 
been to me a strong testimony of 
the divinity of the work of the 
Lord. 

May God help all of us to profit 
by the efforts that are being put 
forth by the Priesthood of the Lord 
to direct us in the path of 
righteousness and truth. May we 
all be faithful to the testimony that 
we have received, and hand it down 
to our children untarnished and un- 
diminished in its power to redeem 
the world of mankind, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN I. HERRICK. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

I heard a lady say as I came into 
this building, in answer to a ques- 
tion, "Were you not able to get a 
seat?" "O yes, I had a good seat, 
but I am coming over here to hear 
a speaker that I know." I do not 
know whom she referred to, though 
I do not think it was myself, for I 
do not know the lady; but I trust 
that we all came here today with 
the full purpose of heart of hearing 
the word of the Lord regardless 
through whom it comes. Much has 
been said, during this conference, 
tending to remind us of the obli- 
gations that we owe to the Church, 
that we owe to ourselves and to our 
neighbors. I would like to read a 
few verses of a revelation given 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith re- 
garding this thought, from section 
68 of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have 
children in Zion or in any of her stakes 



ELDED JOHN L. HERRICK. 



77 



which are organized, that teach them 
not to understand the doctrine of re- 
pentance, faith in Christ, the Son of 
the living God, and of baptism and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on 
of the hands when eight years old, the 
sin be upon the head of the parents; 
for this shall be a law unto the inhabit- 
ants of Zion and of her stakes which are 
organized, and their children shall be 
baptized for the the remission of their 
sins when eight years old and receive 
the laying an of hands; and they shall 
also teach their children to pray and 
walk uprightly before the Lord. And 
the inhabitants of Zion shall also ob- 
serve the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 
And the inhabitants of Zion shall also 
remember their labors, inasmuch as they 
are called to labor, in all faithfulness, 
for the idler shall be had in remem- 
brance before the Lord." 

There are three kinds of responsi- 
bility : first, parental, then collective, 
and then individual. This revelation 
from God teaches, commands in 
fact, that parents should have a 
regard for the careful teaching and 
training of their children. This 
training and this work, the influ- 
ence of it, should commence even 
before the birth of the child, in or- 
der to have the most beneficial ef- 
fect. We all know that it is a law 
that cannot be refuted, that if a 
child is properly taught in its youth 
when it becomes old it will not. go 
astray. It is true that we all know 
of some individual cases where, per- 
haps, children have had the best of 
training, and yet have fallen away 
from the truth ; but if we shall heed 
this commandment to Israel, we will 
rid ourselves as parents of the re- 
sponsibility that God places upon us 
in bringing children Into the world, 
a responsibility that cannot be evad- 
ed. And then, too, it should ex- 
tend not only to our children, to our 
family or families, but to our neigh- 
bors, for we do owe something to 
them. The example that we give 



not only to our nearest neighbor but 
to him who is afar off, if he chances 
to be here, stands for good or evil 
for this great Church. As our in- 
fluence and our acts, if they be 
righteous, redound to the credit and 
to the glory of our Church, so do 
those things which are not pleasing 
in the sight of God, which are 
wrong, cast discredit and dishonor 
upon our Church. 

The individual responsibility 
comes after the child is accountable, 
and only then, and we should en- 
deavor to teach them the principles 
that have been made known by reve- 
lation, by word of mouth, to Israel, 
by the leaders of this Church in 
this conference, tnat they should 
keep inviolate the instructions that 
are given from time to time, be 
pure and chaste, be honorable and 
honest and fair in all things. In 
this connection, we should give 
careful thought, it seems to me, to 
a regard for doing whatever we are 
called upon to do. "The inhabitants 
of Zion also shall remember their 
labors, inasmuch as they are ap- 
pointed to labor, [and we are cer- 
tainly all appointed] in all faithful- 
ness," and that means whatever may 
be the calling, whether it be a dea- 
con or a high priest, we should ful- 
fill that obligation to the best of the 
ability that God gives us. 

I call to mind a legend of the 
great man, the great warrior, who 
had conquered nations and who had 
it in his heart to conquer the world, 
and he inquired wanting to know 
whom he should serve in order to 
serve the greatest thing there was in 
the world, because he had con- 
quered nearly all. "Why," it was 
said to him, "there are more people 
following Satan than any one else, 
and therefore you should serve him. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



So he began and served Satan, with 
the same determination and purpose 
as he had conquered nations. But 
there seemed to be something - lack- 
ing. He did not get the consola- 
tion that he thought he would, and 
finally he inquired again, and he got 
this reply: "Serve Jesus Christ, for 
it is His teachings that will bring 
mankind and raise them from their 
sin, and elevate them in the world, 
and save them in eternity." And 
he began to serve, or he would serve 
Jesus. And when he inquired what 
he was to do, he was told that be- 
side a river, on the opposite shore, 
an altar had been erected where 
those who would come to Christ 
could go and pray, and it should be 
his duty to carry all such on his 
back through the waters when they 
applied to him. "Know you who I 
am?" said he. "I am Alpha, that 
has conquered nations, and should I 
be called upon to do such menial 
service?" "Yes, if thou wishest to 
serve thy master, thou must do this 
thing." And he began and he car- 
ried many, many across the rocks, 
cutting his feet on the sharp stones. 
The work was hard, but he was 
strong in body and mind, and he 
kept it up ; year after year did he 
do this service, and he became old, 
and was unable to proceed, as he 
thought, to go any farther, to carry 
any more across. Finally a voice 
came one day, "Alpha, T want to 
pray." He paid no heed, because 
he thought he was unable to assist. 
"Alpha, I want to go and pray ;" 
and he looked, and beheld a child, 
and he determined ro make the last 
effort, and he did. He took the 
child in his arms and started into 
the water; the swift current almost 
took him down, but he struggled 
until he gained the opposite shore 



and placed that child on the altar, 
and through exhaustion following 
his effort he was almost ready to 
give up the ghost, when he heard 
this commendation : "He who doeth 
these things to the least of mine 
hath done it unto me." And he died. 

Regardless of what duty comes to 
us, my brethren and sisters, let lis 
seize upon the opportunity and do 
our full duty to our Church, to 
ourselves, to our neighbors and to 
the world. Then will God's bless- 
ing be with us to crown our efforts 
with success, and may we have the 
satisfaction to have that plaudit, 
"well-done," that we can get in no 
other way. 

I bear you witness today that 
God's work is established in the 
earth, no more to be taken away, 
that this people whom we call Lat- 
ter-day Saints are those who are 
destined to fill the world with the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. May God 
add His blessings to us, that we may 
be faithful in performing the du- 
ties that devolve upon us. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH E. EOBINSOff. 

(President of California Mission.) 

It is indeed gratifying, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to meet with those 
who agree in faith and in doctrine. 
Frequently in the world, we meet 
with those who have diversified 
views, who teach different "princi- 
ples of salvation," or who teach 
none at all. Recently I had the pri- 
vilege of addressing a club whose 
members say they believe in neither 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



79 



God, Christ, hell nor the devil, and 
yet this body of men and women 
employ and honor a chaplain. It 
struck me as peculiar, and had I not 
been acquainted with some of their 
tenets I should have wondered at 
their appointment: but even they 
contended for this fact, that there is 
some power, some subtle influence 
in prayer and pouring out the soul 
of man to the Universe, as they call 
it. It brings a surcease from disap- 
pointment and pain, makes hope 
glow anew from the ashes of des- 
pair, and, with faith, man may again 
face the problems of life and follow 
them to successful fruition, all 
through the strength of prayer. 
While addressing this audience I 
had occasion to speak of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, my theme being par- 
ticularly the immortality of the soul 
and the hope of the resurrection, 
aye, its very assurance. 

At the close of my address there 
was half an hour given for questions 
and for adverse opinions and criti- 
cisms, and this chaplain arose and 
said unto me : "Elder, you have 
mentioned the name of Jesus 
Christ ; I would like to know if 
there is any evidence in history, 
whatsoever, that would prove that 
such a man ever lived." That may 
sound strange to you my brethren 
and sisters, who have come together 
here to pay homage to Jesus, the 
Christ, to revere His name, and to 
worship Him as one of those who 
have made it possible for this earth 
to be, for our lives and for our 
eternal progression. My answer to 
this man (knowing full well that he 
would not accept the testimony of 
the eight witnesses in the New Tes- 
tament nor the testimony of the so- 
called early Fathers of the church) 
was something like this: At the 



time of His advent and birth, ac- 
cording to the testimony of Taci- 
tus and Suetonius, two pagan his- 
torians, the whole east was in a fer- 
ment of expectation, for tradition 
and precept and sacrifices from time 
immemorial had testified that there 
should be a king born to the Jews ; 
a son and a child should be given 
them, upon whose shoulders should 
rest the government, and He should 
be the Prince of Peace, and should 
be worshiped 'as the Lord God Al- 
mighty Himself ; and that, at the 
time of His advent, wise men of the 
east, others than those three spoken 
of in the scriptures, gave token of 
the fact that the time had arrived. 
And after and during His ministry, 
there arose men contemporaneous 
with Him who bore testimony of 
the fact that he did live and minister 
to the souls of men. Josephus, a 
Jew — and the Jews were prejudiced 
against Him, full of bitter prejudice 
at the time he wrote — mentions 
Him in his writings. He even said 
of Him ; "If it be lawful to call such 
a creature a man, to speak of Him 
as man," testifying that He had 
lived among the Jews and minis- 
tered unto them as a prophet. Again 
Pliny, the younger, spoke of Him 
and His ministry, with Publius Len- 
tulus, procurator of Judea, for just 
as consuls report to the home gov- 
ernment anything of moment and 
interest to the home country, so did 
this procurator report to Caesar and 
the Roman senate, and reported that 
one Jesus Christ, a Nazarite, was 
living amongst the Jews at that 
time, who he said, "is accepted of 
the Gentiles as a true prophet, but 
by His disciples and followers as the 
very son of God." And this man 
Lentulus described the Master, 
using these words : 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"'His hair is the color of a filbert when 
fully ripe, plain to his ear, whence down- 
ward it is more of Orient color, curling, 
waving on his shoulders; in the middle 
of his head is a seam, parting His hair 
after the manner of the Nazarites. His 
forehead is plain and delicate ; the face 
without spot or wrinkle, beautiful with 
a cornel}' red ; his nose and mouth are 
exactly formed ; his beard is the color 
of his hair and thick, not of any length 
but forked. In reproving he is terrible, 
admonishing courteous, in speaking very 
modest and wise ; in proportion of body, 
well shaped. None have seen him laugh. 
Many have seen him weep. A man of 
surpassing beauty, excelling the children 
of men." 

So the testimony of these three 
in particular can be cited aside from 
the tradition of the ancient church 
and from the testimony of the apos- 
tles and disciples, bearing witness 
that Christ did live and reign among 
the sons of men, or at least minister 
among the sons of men, in such 
graciousness that secured Him in 
the affections of His followers, and 
made Him even beloved and re- 
vered by those not of His own na- 
tionality ; for the Centurion who 
came to Him, saying that he had 
a son afflicted in his house and 
begged of the Master to say but 
one word and he should be healed, 
said unto Him, when the Master 
said "I will go unto him at once," 
"I am not worthy that you should 
enter my house ; I am a captain in 
Caesar's household, and T say to 
this man, do thou this, or do thou 
that, and it is done ; and if thou wilt 
but say the word, I know that my 
son will be healed." And the scrip- 
tures record the fact that Christ 
marvelled, for no such faith had He 
known, no not in all Israel ; and He 
spoke the word and the boy was 
healed from that hour forth. So 
it shows, this example, the regard 
in which He was held by this man 



not of His own household, not of 
the nation of Israel. 

Today all Christendom is singing 
anthems of praise, praise and ho- 
sannas, as we do here today, because 
the Christ lives ; and this day, to 
Christendom, means the day of His 
resurrection from the tomb, joy 
coming into the hearts of all men 
who believe in Him, because in Him 
they know they have a Redeemer 
from the tomb, and Savior from 
death and hell. We might, if our 
imagination were but keen enough, 
recall this glad Easter morning, at 
its first inception, when, after His 
hurried burial in a stranger's grave 
(for His death had not been antici- 
pated and His tomb was not pre- 
pared, and so the tender women 
and His friends laid Him away in 
the grave of Joseph of Arimathea, 
until they could further care for 
Him and provide for Him a last 
resting place as they thought.) It 
was their Sabbath day. and it was 
forbidden by the law of the Jews 
that His body should remain longer 
upon the cross. It was taken down, 
and as I have said, hurriedly buried. 
And then, because of the conduct 
of Pontius Pilate, that none should 
come unto it for a certain time, the 
tomb being sealed by the seal of 
Caesar of Rome, none were permit- 
ted to come to pay Him homage or 
respect until that period had passed 
set by the law ; and as it began to 
dawn toward the first day of 
the week, came Mary Magda- 
lene early to the tomb before 
it was yet light, bearing band- 
ages and myrrh and spices to 
further prepare His body for its 
final burial. When she came to the 
sepulchre weeping, the stone had 
been turned aside, the seals broken, 
the soldiers dispersed, and as she 
looked in to the sepulchre she be- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON

held an angel, who declared unto 
her, "He is not here, He is risen." 
In her great grief she did not un- 
derstand all that this message meant 
and would have conveyed had she 
known what we know of the resur- 
rection. Sadly she turned away, in 
hope still that she might find His 
resting place. A personage ap- 
proached down the path. Without 
lifting her tear dimmed eyes, think- 
ing it was only the sexton or the 
gardener so early abroad, she said : 
"Where have they laid Him?" He 
spoke to her in a voice that made 
her fond heart thrill with joy un- 
told, because she recognized the 
voice of her Redeemer and Lord, 
when He cried unto her "Mary !" 
and she lifted her eyes, and when 
she would have embraced Him He 
said : "Touch me not, for I have not 
yet ascended to my Father ; but go 
to my brethren and say unto them. 
I ascend unto my Father and your 
Father and to my God and your 
God." And with winged feet she 
flew along the roadway to carry this 
glad message to the faithful hearts 
who had been bowed down in such 
distress and grief, because their 
Lord and Master, their leader, had 
been crucified. 

Then for a time He walked the 
earth with them, and taught them, 
meeting them upon the holy day 
a week later, and still another week 
later, inviting them, upon His first 
visit, because they were afrighted 
and thought they saw His spirit, to 
handle Him, to observe the wounds 
in His hands and in His feet and 
side, and see that He was not a 
spirit; and He asked them if they 
had any meat there, and they gave 
Him a fish and a honey comb, and 
He ate of it to convince them that it 
was really and truly their Savior or 



their Master with whom they had 
labored and with whom they had 
suffered. A week later He comes to 
them when they have met to praise 
Him again, to bear testimony of this 
glad Easter morning when He arose 
from the dead. But one who was 
doubting, one who had not been 
present, one who had heard only 
their testimonies, one who believed 
only in what he could see and 
handle, material-minded and hard- 
headed after the manner of most 
men, he said, "Why, you have seen 
His spirit, but the dead live not 
again ; the body of man cannot rise 
from the tomb. Lazarus was 
brought back to life, and so with 
the daughter of Jairus, but the dead 
who are laid away as He has been 
do not live again." And as he con- 
tended with them in this fashion 
against their knowledge, the Mas- 
ter, even in His glorious resurrected 
manhood and immortalized state, 
stood before them, and He said, 
Come hither, thou doubting one ; 
thrust thy hand into my side and 
feel the prints of the nails in my 
hands, and handle me and see that 
a spirit hath not flesh and bone as ye 
see me have. And Thomas fell and 
worshiped, exclaiming, "My Lord 
'and my God !" The Savior mildly 
rebuked him in these words : 
Thomas thou hast believed because 
thou hast seen. Blessed are they 
who believe without seeing, who be- 
lieve upon the testimony of these 
my brethren. Therein showing the 
key. the touch-stone of virtue and 
faith, for we are to walk by faith. 

And so "Blessed today is he who 
cometh in the name of the Lord." 
Blessed and praised be the Lord, as 
was sung. "Hosanna unto Him who 
bringeth salvation." Blessed indeed 
is he who believes, having never

seen, and into whose heart has en- 
tered the peace of Christ which sur- 
passeth the understanding of the 
souls of men, that peace which gives 
them an assurance of things as they 
were, as they are, as. they are to be 
— truth, the "sum of existence." In 
the mind of that man or that woman 
there is no doubt, no misgiving, no 
fear, no apprehension of the future, 
if they but keep the faith, that God 
will give to His flock the kingdom, 
that the Christ will reign over them, 
and that when He comes "they shall 
be like Him," for so said John the 
beloved. In this assurance the 
grave is robbed of its victory, and 
death of its sting, all swallowed up 
in the assurance of eternal life and 
immortality. 

We cannot ourselves circumscribe 
the powers of man. When we see 
an infant upon its mother's knee, 
we know that, all things being pro- 
pitious, it shall grow to manhood's 
estate, to enjoy the full powers and 
capabilities thereof, and that so long 
as, undimmed by years and unhurt 
and unbroken by disease or acci- 
cident, he will learn to show and 
perform great things. We do not 
know to what heights he may arise 
in his special field, unless we may 
see it in prophetic vision ; but we , 
know that what man lias done man 
may and can do. But, cut short 
from his progress and achievement 
by death, then when you contem- 
plate eternal life and immortalitv, 
who can circumscribe the possibili- 
ties of man, who can say how far 
lie may go, or how short he may 
fall? The great pagan philosopher, 
Socrates, said that "this is the 
whole, end and aim of man, to be 
like God, and he who follows Him 
shall become like Him." So the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, in this age, 



has added to this truth by the as- 
sertion that "As man is God once 
was, and that as He is man may 
become," because He is our Father, 
and like begets like, and in- 
herent within us are the attri- 
butes of divinity that shall lead us 
into perfection, which Christ intend- 
ed His Saints to attain unto. John 
says : "When the Master shall come 
into whose hands He hath given aU 
power, both in heaven and earth, 
who trampled death and hell under 
His feet, and solved the secret of 
the grave, we shall be like Him, if 
we love His appearing and keep His 
commandments." O. the blessed- 
ness of such a thought ! How full of 
inspiration ! What an incentive to 
try for correct living ! What a 
power is given us to bear under and 
forebear, when we know our real 
destiny, if we but keep the faith, 
if we but believe in Him and do 
His will, if we but keep ourselves 
unspotted from the world ; and not 
only for us but for all the sons 
of our Father who will come unto 
Him, both those who are alive and 
those who are dead, for the Master 
whose body lay in the tomb "went 
and preached to the spirits in pris- 
on," and one can imagine when he 
reads the words of David, pro- 
nounced outside the gates of hell, 
"Lift up your heads, ye gates, and 
be lifted up, ye everlasting doors ; 
the king of glory shall come in." 
And again, how all hell sat up with 
astonishment at the end, breaking in 
upon their solitude from without, 
when they had been "gathered to- 
gether as prisoners in a pit" since 
the death of the first man cast out 
from Eden ; how, when the time 
came and the doors were opened 
and the Master stood before them, 
Isaiah would arise and say: "Did 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

I not tell you that after many days 
we should be visited, and the sun of 
righteousness should arise with 
healing in his wings, and give gifts 
to men, and lead captivity captive 
and the prisoners from the prison 
house." And David, the king and 
poet, would say: "Having testi- 
fied unto you, O Israel, that He 
would not leave my soul in hell nor 
would He suffer the Holy One to 
see corruption." Then might Isaiah 
say: "Did I not prophesy unto 
Israel, Thy dead shall live, together 
with my dead body shall they arise. 
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in 
the dust, for their dew is as the dew 
of the earth, and the earth shall 
cast out its dead, some as Daniel 
said, to everlasting shame and con- 
tempt, because they are filthy still; 
some to shine in the firmament as 
the stars forever, because they have 
constrained men to acts of right- 
eousness." 

Let us, my brethren and sisters, 
be among those who "fight the good 
fight," who "keep the faith," who 
"constrain men to acts of righteous- 
ness," that we with the love of the 
Lord shall shine in the firmament as 
stars forever. I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wen'd your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day . 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

While listening to the remarks of 
our beloved President in the open- 
ing of this Conference, and hearing 
his statement concerning the wilful 



purpose of certain individuals who 
have had it in their hearts to destroy 
the influence and the character of 
the Latter-day Saints, by manufac- 
turing from the whole cloth lies and 
falsehoods, for the purpose of de- 
ceiving the minds of the honest and 
of those who would, if they only 
saw the truth, receive it, I was led 
to think of a story I read, many 
years ago, concerning a man who 
lived by the side of a mountain. He 
came out one morning and found 
the earth enveloped in a great fog. 
He could see only a short distance 
ahead of him, but heard crackling 
sounds on the mountain side, the 
breaking of the bushes, but could 
see at first no object. He drew 
nearer to the location of the sound, 
and then, in the. dim mist and fog, 
thought he saw a monster of un- 
usual proportions, steadily creeping 
toward him. He became alarmed, 
but still desired to see more of this 
supposed monster. As he drew 
nearer still, he discovered to his 
astonishment, instead of it being 
a monster, it was a human being, a 
man, and, as it came still closer, 
to his great surprise, he found it to 
be his own beloved brother. I have 
thought how truly this represents 
the blinded condition of our breth- 
ren and sisters in the world with 
respect to the Latter-day Saints. 
Through the misrepresentation and 
falsehoods that have been manufac- 
tured, that have created the cloud or 
fog that has obscured the minds of 
men, they have been led to believe 
that we were monsters of some un- 
usual proportions. In the times that 
are passed and gone, men were 
taught to believe that we actually 
had horns, and were unlike other 
human beings ; that we were seeking 
the lives of our fellowmen, were 



84

nothing short of cut-throats and 
robbers. Even now there are per- 
sons who quietly whisper as they 
come within the precincts of this 
city, to the first stranger they meet, 
"Will you please show me a Mor- 
mon?" The chances are they are 
already addressing a member of our 
Church. But the impression has 
been disseminated so generally that 
we are unlike everybody else, that 
we are possessed of such evil pro- 
pensities, and are such monsters, 
from that which has been represent- 
ed concerning us, that we are not 
even human beings. 

Thank God, the mists that 'have 
obscured men's minds do not cloud 
them today as much as they did 
formerly — notwithstanding, a great 
effort is being made to manufacture 
more mist, more cloud, more fog 
to obscure the minds of men. The 
old system won't work so well to- 
day as it did formerly. The world 
is drawing nearer to the Latter-day 
Saints. The hundreds of thousands 
who are passing through this city, 
coming in contact with the members 
of the Church here, and observing 
it in its actual working operations 
are changing their minds, and we 
are coming closer to them. When 
I think of the representatives of this 
Church, the two thousand mission- 
aries, or near that number, who are 
going from door to door, making 
themselves known as representative 
members of the Church, I am led 
to believe that their influence is 
causing a change of sentiment. 
Many times our missionaries have 
been denied the privilege and op- 
portunity of living in the homes of 
the people, when it became known 
that they were "Mormon" Elders. 
Persons who have rooms to rent 
often turn our Elders away, or 



sometimes, with much misgiving, 
receive them. In some instances the 
Elder does not let his religious be- 
lief be known until after he has 
secured his lodging and accommo- 
dations, where he is going to pay 
for his room ; and then, when it is 
found out that he is a "Mormon" 
Elder, they are almost ready to turn 
him out of their door. But, I have 
not yet found in my experience, 
with hundreds of Elders, where a 
"Mormon" Elder stayed for thirty 
days in the home of a person who 
had the greatest prejudice, but that 
person has become a friend of the 
"Mormon" people. Some have said 
to me, as I have asked those with 
whom the Elders stay — as I go 
about among them from time to 
time — "What kind of men are 
these 'Mormon' boys? The answer 
is, they are the best, cleanest men 
we have ever met in our lives. When 
they come to say good-by, there are 
tears shed by some of those who 
first were doubtful of receiving 
them ; and they have said to me, 
"Don't take them away from us ! 
or, send some others back to us." 
I say again, as we are coming out 
among the world and letting them 
see what manner of men we are, 
and as they are coming nearer to 
us, the fog is disseminating, and 
they are recognizing us, not as 
the monster, but as human beings 
after all, like unto themselves. As 
they come still closer to us, and 
learn the intent and purpose of our 
hearts, they will find, too, that we 
are not only human beings, but that 
we are their beloved brothers, hav- 
ing the welfare of mankind at heart, 
and doing more for the world to- 
day, without earthly consideration, . 
than any other community in the 
world. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

"What greater love hath any man 
than this, that a man lay down his 
life for his friend?" Our Elders, 
when they leave their homes, have 
no fear whether they shall lay down 
their lives or not. They have the 
spirit that was in their fathers when 
they sang, " And should we die be- 
fore our journey's through, happy 
day, all is well." The same spirit 
burns in the hearts of their sons and 
daughters, who leave their homes 
and take their lives in their hands. 
They, too, can say, "And should 
we die before our journey's through, 
happy day, all is well." It has been 
my sorrow to have to bring home 
two of our missionaries who died 
in our field, one since our last con- 
ference, and to have the great sor- 
row to bring them home to father 
and mother and other loved ones 
who had anticipated their return in 
life with all fondness and affection. 
The last one referred to had been 
out two years except two days, 
when he was stricken down and 
taken away from us, and we had to 
bring his body home. But it did 
not shake the courage of the 
brethren who remained, nor did it 
daunt the feeling of the parents and 
brothers and sisters at home. No the 
Elders are willing to go; and fear 
not the consequences. Not long ago, 
I stood by the side of a father, who 
went to San Francisco, to receive 
his son who was returning home 
because of sickness that he had con- 
tracted in the islands. He was being 
brought home to be nursed back to 
health again. The father stood 
on the pier, waiting for the ship 
to arrive, and when it steamed into 
the harbor the sad news was broken 
to him that the son, whom he had 
expected to receive and take home 
to nourish to health, had died and 



had been buried at sea. Oh ! the 
great load of sorrow that was cast 
upon his aching heart ! He was to 
return to the family at home to bear 
that message to the mother of the 
boy; and he said to me, with tears 
streaming down his cheeks, "I loved 
him as I loved my own life ; I have 
seven other sons, yet if I knew every 
one of them would come home or 
end their mission like that, I would 
give every one of them to the serv- 
ice of the Lord." What greater 
love has any people in the world 
than this, that they give their sons, 
their own lives, their means, and 
their all for the welfare of mankind. 
These Elders as they go from door 
to door have burning in their hearts 
a warm love and affection for their 
fellow men. How can they travel 
uphill and down, in the rain, in the 
snow, or in the mud, sometimes 
sleeping out of doors, seeking the 
souls of men, without begetting love 
for the children of our Father? I 
want to say to you, that the world 
will discover, as I have already ob- 
served, that we are their best 
friends, their own beloved brethren. 

Not only will they discover this, 
but they will discover that they need 
us, and need also the message that 
we have to bear to the world ; and 
that they cannot get along without 
it. Their great efforts to stem the 
tide of infidelity, to stop the rav- 
ages of that spirit of unbelief that 
is undermining the churches, de- 
stroying the ministry, and making 
vacant the pews, seem to be un- 
availing. Out in the city of Port- 
land, Gypsy Smith, one of the 
greatest revivalists the world has to- 
day, held a series of thirty meet- 
ings, where thousands of people list- 
ened to his eloquence and came un- 
der the spell of his power. During 



SG 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that time, some three thousand per- 
sons came forward, and signed 
cards that they would affiliate with 
some one or other of the hundred 
and ten chuches that joined in that 
great revival. After the meetings 
were over, the choir of a thousand 
voices had been disbanded, the tab- 
ernacle was silent, and the men and 
women were left to themselves, a 
sad wail comes from the hundred 
and ten ministers who joined in the 
revival, that less than 10 per cent, 
of those who signed cards actually 
became identified with the church. 
What is the matter? O, there is 
that something lacking that took 
possession of the souls of men when 
they cried out on the day of Pente- 
cost, "Men and brethren, what shall 
we do to be saved ?" and the answer 
came from that authorized servant 
of God — not come here and sign 
cards or come here and give me 
your hand, but — "Repent of your 
sins, every one of you, and be bap- 
tized in the name of Jesus Christ 
for the remission of sins, and ye 
shall receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost." That is what the world is 
lacking today; and they are trying 
to hold their fort, to maintain their 
cause, without those powers and 
blessings that come from the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and they 
fail. 

A great religious movement has 
been inaugurated looking to inter- 
esting men in the church. Few men 
attend churches in the world. There 
is only a scattering few in the midst 
of a comparatively large attendance 
of women ; and a movement, that 
has behind it millions of dollars, is 
being pushed from city to city to in- 
terest men in the church. When I 
have thought of this, oh, how my 



heart goes out in gratitude to the 
God of heaven who has given us 
the key by which this great question 
can be solved. If they ever solve it, 
they will have to copy us, and learn 
of us. For, behold, the Church pro- 
vides something for every male 
member to do — the Priesthood re- 
ceived by them placing a portion of 
responsibility upon each individ- 
ual member. No man will be inter- 
ested unless he works. The Lord 
has solved that question for us ; and 
the world is trying to solve it with- 
out His aid and assistance ; if they 
ever solve it, it will be because they 
have imitated "Mormonism" again. 

A few weeks ago, I had the priv- 
ilege of standing, with some of my 
brethren, in a sacred spot in the 
western part of New York, in the 
sacred grove. As we lifted up our 
voices in song, where Joseph knelt 
and poured out his soul unto God, 
my heart was melted and softened 
within me, and I felt then as I 
never have before in my life, that 
Joseph told the truth, the absolute 
truth, that indeed he did have the 
glorious vision, that the Father and 
the Son did stand before him, that 
he saw them and heard the voice 
of the Son of God. My heart went 
out in thanksgiving to have the as- 
surance that Jesus, the Savior of 
the world, who died for men, who 
gave His life for us, who is the life 
and the way, still loves our Father's 
children, still has interest in them, 
and did come in the age in which 
you and I live, and spoke to man 
again. 

Calling your attention to the re- 
marks of President Robinson, that 
a great number of educated men 
disregard all the evidences that have 
been given with respect to the ex- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



87 



istence of Christ, throw it aside and 
disregard it, and even among those 
professing to believe the Bible there 
is a lack of faith that Jesus Christ 
was the Son of God, possessed of 
the powers He exhibited, according 
to the testimony of the writers of 
the Scriptures ; I felt to say yes, we 
could repudiate all that, and yet 
"Mormonism" would establish the 
fact that Jesus Christ is the Son 
of God, that He lives, and that He 
did, in our own day, appear and talk 
to men in the flesh. That is our 
witness and testimony. Although 
all other evidences may be destroy- 
ed, we have this knowledge of Him, 
that He lives, and that He is the 
resurrected Son of God, that He is 
the life and the way. We do not 
know the means and ways by which 
He shall bring about the resurrec- 
tion from the dead, neither do we 
know the means nor ways by which 
nature's products, that a few months 
ago seemed dead, are brought back. 
The flowers withered, the grass de- 
cayed and lying flat upon the earth ; 
no evidence of life in the trees ; they 
all seemed dead ; yet, behold, by the 
magical powers God has organized 
in the sunlight, and the power of 
other agencies, here is new life 
springing up ; the tree puts forth 
its bud, its leaf, the grass springs 
up again, and there is a complete re- 
newal of that which was apparently 
dead. I have thought, in this con- 
nection, of the fathers and mothers, 
husbands and wives who have laid 
their loved ones away stilled in 
death, the lip that once spoke loving 
words speaks no more, the hand that 
fondly caressed us drops with no 
sign of life in it, and we say they 
are dead. They shall as surely live 
again as the tree that slumbers 



through winter. While they shall 
not come forth by the light of the 
sun, that shines and gives life to 
vegetable nature, yet they shall live 
again just as really, truly, and cer- 
tainly as these flowers shall grow 
again, when He who has the power 
of life within Him, even the Son 
of God, the Master of element, ex- 
ercises that power to raise men from 
the dead. There is no doubt about 
that. The world needs the testi- 
mony that Jesus is in very deed the 
Christ, and that our Father in 
heaven is a reality, a tangible be- 
ing and not a myth. 

The world also needs the knowl- 
edge concerning baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins, with 
the multitude of doctrines and prin- 
ciples relating to this matter! O, 
what a clearing up of doubt there 1 
was on this subject when, 83 years 
ago, John the Baptist appeared and 
laid his hands upon the heads of 
men, conferring tipon them the 
Aaronic Priesthood, and told them 
the way and manner by which they 
should baptize by immersion for 
the remission of sins, and gave them 
authority to commission others. I 
say the world needs this knowledge ; 
the people are wandering in dark- 
ness and ignorance without it ; and 
they will never obtain the blessings 
they seek except by obedience to 
the law of the Lord, and the author- 
ity of Jesus Christ. Neither shall 
they be able to organize the Church 
of Christ, and give it all its officers, 
organization and working perfec- 
tion, unless they receive authority 
from heaven, and adopt that meth- 
od, pattern and system which 
was given to the Prophet Joseph by 
the revelations of God. They are 
seeking to solve the question of 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



finance, for maintenance of their 
churches. They are not able to do 
it except they shall take a lesson 
from "Mormonism." The great 
Baptist convention in the city of 
Portland a few months ago spent 
two days discussing this subject. I 
had a visit from two of the leading 
ministers who asked me to explain 
the system of tithing as adopted 
by the Latter-day Saints ; after 
hearing my explanation, they read- 
ily conceded that it is the only thing. 
Again, I say, they need "Mormon- 
ism" to solve that question. 

Also, in connection with the ob- 
servance of the fast day. (In this 
relation, I desire to impress upon 
the Latter-day Saints at home and 
everywhere, that we are not, accord- 
ing to the report that has been made 
•by the Presiding Bishopric, doing 
our full duty in this respect). How 
can the poor be provided for, and 
be properly taken care of? The 
Lord had devised the way and the 
means, through each and every one 
of His Saints fasting one day each 
month, that thereby they may feel 
the pangs of hunger, and sympath- 
ize with the hungry; that they may 
also be brought to realize, in this ex- 
perience, their- indebtedness to God 
for the food they have, and for the 
other comforts of life As they 
experience these things, they gratify 
their feelings in giving to the poor 
that which they have saved by fast- 
ing, and this becomes a blessing to 
them both spiritual and physical, 
cultivating magnanimous and gen- 
erous attributes, by denying them- 
selves and ministering to those 
who are in need. Instead of our 
Church showing, in fast offerings.an 
average of only 17 cents per capita 
a year, it ought to show, at least, ten 
cents per member per month ; there- 



by we would, by complying with 
this, have saved the Church in the 
neighborhood of $200,000 last year, 
that was taken from the tithes to 
help the poor. Let us set that ex- 
ample, brothers and sisters, in this 
respect to the world, that they may 
see how the poor may be provided 
for ; for, if each individual in all 
the world fasted ±rom two meals 
once a month, the money thus saved 
could provide ample' means to care 
for all the poor in all the world. 
Let us maintain that standard the 
Lord has given, so that the world 
may see the beauty of this thing. . 

So, in my heart, I feel confi- 
dent as I live that the world needs 
"Mormonism," and will come to 
understand it better as the years 
pass by. I hope that you and my- 
self, and all members of the 
Church living in obscure wards, or 
stakes, or elsewhere, that we shall 
live up to the standard the Lord has 
given ; and by our example, preach 
a sermon that our words cannot 
convey. I repeat what I have said 
before : If we ever convert the 
world, it will be through our lives, 
and not through preaching our doc- 
trines, for they will be attracted to 
our lives long before they will ap- 
preciate the truth of the principles 
that have made our lives what they 
are. 

God help us, my brethren and 
sisters, to appreciate these blessed 
privileges that have come to us, 
and let us be conscious all the day 
long that we are pioneers for the 
rest of the world. This Gospel is 
for all men, and God has called 
you and me, and our fathers and 
mothers, to pioneer the way, to fix 
the standards, to maintain the cause, 
come what will or what may, that 
eventually we may prove a bless-

ing not only to our own posterity, 
but to all the world, as God intended 
we should, even to aid in the salva- 
tion of the souls of men. 

May the Lord help us in this 
grand and noble labor, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Lo ! the mighty God appearing, 
From on high Jehovah speaks ! 

Eastern lands the summons hearing, 
O'er the west His thunder breaks. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder M. M. Steele. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

Another meeting of the Confer- 
ence was held in the Assembly Hall, 
at 2 p. m., at which Elder Heber J. 
Grant presided. The Twentieth 
ward choir again furnished the 
musical exercises. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Hark! ten thousand thousand voices 

Sing the song of jubilee! 
Earth, through all her tribes, rejoices— 

Broke her long captivity. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Richard K. Thomas 

An anthem, "The Holy Temple," 
by Joseph J. Daynes, was sung by 
the choir. 

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

Our beloved President Joseph F. 
Smith, said, in the beginning of this 
Conference, that every faithful Lat- 
ter-day Saint was entitled to the 
spirit of revelation to guide and 



direct him in paths of righteous- 
ness, and to instruct him pertaining 
to the Gospel of our Lord and Sa- 
vior Jesus Christ. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in his early ministry, 
declared in power to the people who 
listened to him a similar doctrine, 
that every one who would repent 
and be baptized for the remission 
of his sins should know that he was 
a prophet, and that this work was 
of the Lord. This is in harmony 
with the Master's words recorded 
in the 7th chapter of John, begin- 
ning with the 16th verse: "Jesus 
answered and said, My doctrine is 
not mine but His that sent me, and 
if any man will do His will he shall 
know of the doctrine whether it be 
of God or whether I speak of My- 
self." This doctrine of revelation 
has been true in every age of the 
world when the Lord has had a 
people upon the earth, or servants 
commissioned to do His will. It is 
true in this day when the glorious 
promise has been given that there 
will never again be a time when 
there will not be men and women 
who will have and enjoy the spirit 
of revelation, and know that God 
lives, and that His Church and 
Kingdom is in the earth. 

In the meridian of time our 
Savior established His Church. He 
delivered the principles of life and 
salvation to all who would listen ; 
but the world was not ready for the 
consummation of all things. The 
Church and the officers established 
by the Master were changed, and 
the ordinances, of the Gospel also 
were changed. Instead of Apostles, 
Seventies and Elders, popes, cardi- 
nals, and other officers were created. 
Instead of the simple principles, 
much of heathen religion was graft- 
ed into the church. Following the

primitive days came a time of dark- 
ness, and after the darkness a day of 
reformation. The Lord inspired 
mighty men, Luther, Calvin, Huss 
and others, who arose in behalf of 
religious liberty and gave to the 
world much light and much free- 
dom all in harmony with what was 
predicted should come to ' pass. 
Through many great men, and 
much tribulation, the world was 
prepared for the light of the res- 
tored Gospel and the establishment 
of the Church in the last days. 
Closely following the reformation, 
the Pilgrim and Puritan fathers 
came to this glorious land of lib- 
erty, that they might worship God 
according to the dictates of their 
own conscience ; but though these 
Puritans, Pilgrims, Baptists and oth- 
ers like them came to gain lib- 
erty in worshiping God, they quar- 
reled among themselves, and separ- 
ated in religious factions ; but in 
their jarring they learned much that 
has been good for us in this day. 
After gaining liberty from England, 
following a long struggle, good men 
and wise were selected to form the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Some of those men were so illiberal 
in their ideas pertaining to religion 
that, for a time, they refused to 
have a prayer offered in the consti- 
tutional convention ; but the motion 
of John Adams finally prevailed, 
and a good churchman was selected 
to offer a prayer, that their minds 
might be moved upon to frame a 
constitution that would secure liber- 
ty to all who would come to this 
land. 

As Latter-day Saints we believe 
that our Father in heaven looked 
down in tender mercy with an 
answer, and that the Constituion of 
this glorious country was inspired 



of God. Our Father prepared this 
nation and inspired its laws, that 
He might establish a people in the 
land of promise that would teach 
principles of truth and righteous- 
ness. He likewise sent His heaven- 
ly servants to ordain men to the 
Holy Priesthood to officiate in the 
things of God. Since the establish- 
ing of this work we have been under 
persecution, notwithstanding our 
right to worship as we please. 
Satan has done his utmost to 
thwart the purposes of our Father, 
and from the time he attacked the 
Prophet Joseph in the woods, 
during that first prayer, he has at- 
tacked almost every other thing 
that has been done under inspiration 
from heaven. The Prophet Joseph, 
in his day, had gone through so 
much persecution that he said, when 
he was in Nauvoo, that "puny man 
might just as well put forth his arm 
to stop the Mississippi river in its 
course as to try to stop this glorious 
work of our Father." Men cannot 
stop it. It is not man's work; it 
is the work of the Lord. He has 
established it. He is at the helm, 
and has ruled and overruled all 
things for its onward progress. 1 
am thankful, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I know that it is decreed 
that this work will be bigger to- 
morrow than it is today. Every 
Latter-day Saint who has kept the 
commandments of our Father, and 
done His will, knows of the doc- 
trine. The young men of Zion who 
go into the world, with little experi- 
ence, just as soon as they do the 
will of the Father, or strike a blow 
for truth, learn that this is the work 
of God. They stand forth boldly 
before the world, and proclaim it to 
their fellow men. They proclaim 
it in power and simplicity, and their

testimony cannot be refuted, for it is 
the truth. 

On one occasion a gentleman said 
to me, "Where did you get your 
authority, Mr. Ellsworth?" I told 
him I was ordained by so-and-so, 
who was ordained by some one else, 
and he was ordained by . Joseph 
Smith, and Joseph Smith was or- 
dained by Peter, James and John. 
"I don't believe it," he said. I re- 
sponded, "That does not affect the 
truthfulness of the ordination ; and 
may I ask, can you trace your au- 
thority so far? I have a connect- 
ing link to heaven, while you trace 
your authority transmitted by a few 
men, and they self-ordained." 
These young men who go out from 
Zion bearing testimony that God 
has established this work, may not 
be believed by the world in general, 
but it is true nevertheless. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints, both at home and 
abroad, can lift up their heads and 
look the world in the face and re- 
joice in the glorious truths that 
have been given, and rejoice that 
they are privileged to be Latter-day 
Saints is very deed. I think it is a 
privilege and a blessing above all 
blessings that have been given upon 
earth to the children of men. We 
have a right to sing a new song, to 
rejoice in the truth, and put forth 
our best efforts in our work. 

The Book of Mormon that was 
given to the world has been one of 
the greatest witnesses concerning 
the divinity of our Lord and Master 
Jesus Christ. While the world at 
large, has not accepted it, yet they 
cannot disprove its divine authen- 
ticity. Every man who has dis- 
tributed that book, by selling it or 
otherwise, has sowed good seed. It 
carries a strong power of testimony 
and conviction of the truth, and 



those in the world who have receiv- 
ed that book in their homes have 
been softened in their feelings to- 
wards the Latter-day Saints. I am 
thankful beyond words for the op- 
portunity that I have had in dis- 
tributing this great testimony con- 
cerning the divinity of Christ. In 
the Doctrine & Covenants, we are 
given an admonition not to forget 
it, and not to forget the teachings 
given therein, and those who do will 
be under condemnation. I firmly 
believe that book is one of the great- 
est witnesses our Father has given 
in the last days to bring the world 
to believe in Christ, the Lord. Our 
friends in the world profess a be- 
lief in Christ as the greatest re- 
ligious teacher ; but it is truly a rev- 
elation to them to tell the story that 
Jesus Christ, who was born of 
Mary, was, in fact, the Only Be- 
gotten of the Father in the flesh. 
The Book of Mormon is most pow- 
erful in its testimony concerning 
the birth of Christ and His divine 
origin. It will help the world to 
know Him, and to receive the spirit 
of revelation in their hearts. It will 
help them to know that our Father 
has a work in the world that will 
save His children if they will but 
listen and obey. The last few years, 
in the United States especially, 
there has been a great work done 
in testifying of the truth of the 
Book of Mormon, and I rejoice 
in the spirit that has been mani- 
fested, and the work that has been 
accomplished. There have been 
upwards of 175,000 copies of the 
Book of Mormon distributed in the 
United States alone, and it is pleas- 
ing to know that the spirit of the 
book follows it in to the homes of 
the people. In almost every home 
where one of these books has been

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



left, our Elders find if not a friend- 
ly feeling that the spirit of animos- 
ity and hatred has been much les- 
sened. 

I rejoice to know that the work in 
the Northern States mission is in- 
creasing and that the people are 
looking with much favor towards 
the west and towards the Latter- 
day Saints. They are singing our 
praises concerning the material 
work that has been done in this part 
of the earth ; and while they do not 
know that religion is the foundation 
of this great material success, yet in 
a few years, I am firmly convinced, 
they will discovei that true re- 
ligion has been back of and under- 
neath this great movement. That it 
is God and His power and influence 
that have been the cause and motive 
power permeating all this wonderful 
work. 

The world has not been able to 
destroy the work. The time is past 
for that, and the time is fast coming 
when they will be led to see that the 
truth is with us. The world con- 
tains many honest people, and their 
hearts are warm towards any good 
work that has gone forth in the 
world. They are doing much to 
care for the sick and afflicted, and 
the poor among them. They sym- 
pathize with the distressed and 
those who mourn, and they seem 
to be feeling after the truth. I be- 
lieve we can look in favor upon 
them, and let our hearts, go out 
in love toward them. Though we 
were driven from Missouri, and 
banished from Illinois, we can con- 
tinue to send our sons and daugh- 
ters, fathers and husbands back to 
them, with hearts full of love, and 
plead with them to repent, and wor- 
ship God, and believe in his Son 
Jesus Christ as the Savior of the 



world. We will continue to do 
that, for we can never convert them 
in any other way. Thousands who 
have reviled us have done it ignor- 
antly, and thousands of those who 
have persecuted us have thought 
that they were doing God's service. 
The Latter-day Saints have no ani- 
mosity in their hearts. They are 
sending their sons and daughters 
back to the very homes from which 
they were driven, and to the very 
states that banished their fathers 
and mothers. 

I rejoice to have the privilege of 
laboring in that part of the world 
from which we were driven. We 
have found many honest men and 
women there, whose hearts are true, 
and we are growing more and more 
to love our brethern and sisters in 
the world, and to labor among them 
with hearts full of compassion and 
sympathy. Our Elders have gone 
to those cities, states, and counties 
from which we were driven, and 
the honest men and women are lis- 
tening to their message, and receiv- 
ing, by the spirit of revelation, a 
knowledge that this is the work of 
our Father in heaven. 

I have had the privilege of labor- 
ing with about a thousand young 
men, and a few young women mis- 
sionaries, and I do not believe that 
I can put my finger on one that 
has gone astray. Almost without 
an exception they have proven 
themselves true, and their testimony 
has gone straight to the hearts of 
the honest, and they can stand, re- 
joicing, this Easter Sunday, in the 
presence of a risen Redeemer. I 
feel in my heart thankful that we 
have a testimony of the truth, and 
have the privilege of bearing it to 
the children of men ; that we do 
know that God lives, that Jesus is 



ELDER WILLIAM McLACHLAN. 



the Christ, and that He has spoken 
in these last days to His servants 
and given unto us a message of sal- 
vation. 

May we appreciate the position 
that we occupy in the world ; and 
may the prophets of the Lord who 
stand at our head live a long time 
upon the earth, and be magnified 
in the eyes of the people. May they 
be given power over the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints, that we may 
attain the full standard in the work 
that God requires. May the mothers 
in Israel impress their sons and 
daughters with the feeling that they 
are indeed the children of God, and 
that upon their shoulders rests the 
responsibility of proclaiming to the 
world that Jesus is the Christ, that 
He has started a work, a marvelous 
work and a wonder, the work of 
our Heavenly Father for the salva- 
tion of the souls of men, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM M'LACHLAN. 

(President of Pioneer Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
very grateful, indeed, for the privi- 
lege of being a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. Upwards of fifty years 
ago I became attached to the "Mor- 
mon" Church ; and from the year 
1863, in which I arrived in the City 
of Salt Lake, I have been a steady 
worker, though not so active as I 
would like to have been, in the 
Church. In the light of fifty years 
experience, or over, there is only 
one regret upon my mind, that Is 
that I have not done more good, and 
been more useful in the hands of the 
Lord in helping to establish His 
work. 



93 

We are told by the Redeemer of 
mankind that "no man knoweth the 
things of God save by the Spirit 
of God," and that is the only means 
through which we receive a testi- 
mony and knowledge of the truth of 
this work, If there was no other 
evidence today that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet, that would be suffi- 
cient to convince me that he was 
sent of God. The doctrines that 
he taught, the promise that he made 
to the people, that if they would 
do the will of the Father they 
should know of the doctrine wheth- 
er it was of God or whether he 
spoke of himself, is also 'convincing 
proof to me. I can testify for my- 
self that, after being baptized for 
the remission of sins, I received a 
knowledge of this work, that it was 
of God, that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet sent of God, and that every 
revelation that is recorded in the 
Doctrine and Covenants is evidence 
of the divine mission of that man. 
I have never in my life from the 
day I was baptized into the Church 
until now, read anything that would 
compare with the revelations given 
in the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and the Book of Mormon. 
The light, the intelligence, the wis- 
dom and the understanding that are 
communicated in these revelations 
to Joseph Smith, in his early youth, 
are inspiring to me. He grew rapid- 
ly in wisdom, and accumulated 
knowledge and understanding that 
were surprising, beyond anything 
that we have on record outside the 
history of the Redeemer of the 
world. 

Men and women, if they will live 
their religion and keep the Spirit 
of God, will not deny the truth of 
this work. Men or women when 
they sin will lose the testimony of 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Spirit of God, it won't stay with 
them, and we are ourselves to blame 
if we get into this condition. It 
is not the Lord; it is not His ser- 
vants or any one else, but the agen- 
cy that we received from God is the 
cause of it, in that we were given 
to do as we please, and that agency 
permeates the spirit and genius of 
this work. When we come up be- 
fore the Almighty to receive sen- 
tence for the deeds done in the 
body, how will men stand who have 
borne testimony of this truth and 
afterwards denied it? Can they 
say that they never had this testi- 
mony? N<§t so, but they will come 
under heavy condemnation from 
the Lord. 

There is everything in this work 
to encourage men and women to be 
loyal and true to it. We will grow, 
we will increase in faith, in humil- 
ity and in every good work, while 
we cherish and cultivate the Spirit 
that comes from the presence of 
our Father. Let us be faithful; 
let us be true Latter-day Saints. Let 
us look after our children There 
is an immense work to be done in 
this city and in all the stakes of 
Zion. There are many thousands 
that need to be looked after, We 
want to save our posterity, our boys 
and girls, by setting before them a 
good example, teaching them cor- 
rect doctrine, and leading them, by 
the influence of the Spirit of God, 
in the path of life and salvation. 
May God help us in this work, that 
our boys and girls may grow up 
in the faith of the gospel, and be- 
come mighty in the hands of God 
in the establishment of His great 
work in the earth. This is the 
greatest desire of my heart, to see 
the children grow up to be true 
and faithful Latter-day Saints. 



God bless the Latter-day Saints, 
and bless our bretheren who stand 
at the head to direct the affairs of 
this work in which we are engaged. 
I pray that God will sustain them 
in the future, and bless them even 
more abundantly than He has done 
in the past. I have all the faith 
and confidence possible in these 
men, I wish to sustain them by 
every word and deed of my life, 
because I know that they are men 
of God, and that they seek the in- 
terest and welfare and blessing of 
the people, not only of the Latter- 
day Saints, but, as Brother Ells- 
worth has told us, they seek the 
salvation of all mankind. This spirit 
of liberty and tolerance should exist 
in all of us, to labor for the benefit 
of the children of men. The mission 
that we have today is broad and 
deep, and it takes into considera- 
tion the whole human family, no 
matter what race they belong to. 
We have got to labor for their re- 
demption. It is the work that the 
Savior commenced, and that is 
handed down through Joseph Smith 
to you and to me. May God help us 
to faithfully perform the work that 
He has assigned to us, individually 
and collectively, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 

(President of Beaver Stake.) 

It may be somewhat surprising 
to the stranger within our gates 
that, during the proceedings of our 
conference this day, there have not 
been more references made to the 
occasion which the world recognizes 
as one of the greatest events in the 
whole year that of Easter Sunday, 
commemorating as it does, in their 
minds, and in their forms and man- 



ELDER JOHN F. TOLTON. 



96 



ner of worship, the rising of our 
Lord and Redeemer from the grave. 
We recognize as a people the im- 
portance of that great event. We 
recognize it as one of the essential 
principles in the redemption of the 
human family, for without the res- 
urrection from the grave there 
would be no salvation for the sons 
and daughters of men. We do be- 
lieve that the great event celebrated 
on this occasion should overshadow 
others, for we recognize in it, as 
I said, one of the essential princi- 
ples of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. To our minds it adds testi- 
mony and truth to the divinitv of 
this work; and we believe that all 
men should ever bear in mind, not 
only on this one occasion of the year, 
but every day of the year, the life 
and divine mission of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ, for He came 
into the world and gave His life 
that men might live. 

We believe in the divinity of 
Christ. We believe that He was 
ordained to come forth in the merid- 
ian of time, to establish His work 
in the world, that men might un- 
derstand the great plan of salva- 
tion which His life represented to 
them. We believe that in the estab- 
lishment of His church He gave un- 
to the world a set of principles that 
are not only calculated and intended 
to make better men and women in 
this life, but also to prepare us for 
the great life that lies beyond the 
veil. If we consider but one in- 
stance or one principle in the great 
catalogue that has been given unto 
us, we are not doing justice unto 
those other principles which are es- 
sential for the salvation of the hu- 
man family. This day is being recog- 
nized, as I stated, by all Christen- 
dom, and all the sermons, perhaps, 



of the Christian world that are be- 
ing delivered from the pulpit today, 
are based upon that one great and 
divine truth, that Christ is risen 
from the grave, that He has burst 
the bands of death, and- that He has 
brought to man immortality and 
eternal life if we will live according 
to the gospel which He established 
in the world. 

I believe, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that there is one failing that 
some of the Latter-day Saints mani- 
fest, that is lack of Sufficient in- 
terest in gaining a perfect under- 
standing of all the principles of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
believe that many are becoming 
lax, in a manner, with regard to 
our duties, with regard to under- 
standing the great principles of 
eternal life ; "for this is life eternal, 
that we may know thee, the only 
true and living God and Jesus 
Christ whom thou hast sent," With- 
out that knowledge we cannot be 
saved in the kingdom of God. So 
in this world of enlightenment, in 
this age of the world when men 
are following the lines of least re- 
sistance, many are seeking after the 
pleasures of this world and forget- 
ting the responsibilities that rest up- 
on them as the servants and hand- 
maidens of God. 

We are given a mission in life, 
and that is to understand the pur- 
poses for which we were created, 
what our earthly mission is, and 
what is the destiny of man. We 
cannot understand these things 
without first seeking for light and 
truth, without studying the scrip- 
tures that have been given unto us 
for our edification and information. 
In the early rise of the Church, the 
Prophet Joseph Smith gave unto 
his people, and unto the Elders of 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Church, some of the cardinal 
principles by which they were to 
be governed in seeking for light, 
and knowledge, and intelligence. 
We have been accused by the world 
of being an exclusive and ignorant 
people, of being a people who in- 
clined to not reach out into the 
revelations of science and thought 
according to modern age and usage. 
The fact is, if we would follow the 
instructions that have been given 
unto us b> the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, there is no people in the 
world who should be broader mind- 
ed, or be better prepared to under- 
stand the conditions and purposes 
for -which mankind have been crea- 
ted, and placed upon the earth, than 
the Latter-day Saints. Let us read 
one declaration and see if that bears 
a spirit of exclusion. The Prophet 
Joseph gave unto this people this 
exhortation : 

"That you shall teacn one another the 
doctrine of the Kingdom; teach ye dili- 
gently and my grace shall attend you, 
that you may be instructed more per- 
fectly in theory, in principle, in doc- 
trine, in the law of the gospel, in all 
things that pertain unto the kingdom of 
God, that are expedient for you to un- 
derstand ; of things both in heaven and 
in earth, and under the earth ; things 
which have been, things which are, 
things which must shortly come to pass ; 
things which are at home, things which 
are abroad ; the wars and the perplexi- 
ties of the nations, and the judgments 
which are on the land, and a knowledge 
also of countries and of kingdoms." 

Now, if we attempt to follow out 
this injunction, and prepare our- 
selves as Elders in Israel, as min- 
isters of the gospel, as teachers of 
righteousness, as followers of - the 
meek and lowly Jesus, there is a 
vast deal of labor in which we may 
engage, wherein we may secure our 
vindication and the conversion of 



the world. Are we doing that, my 
brethren and sisters? Are we fol- 
lowing those injunctions that have 
been given unto us by our prophet? 

If we examine the character of 
amusements and entertainments 
that are being presented to us to- 
day, I fear that we will find we are 
falling short in the performance of 
our duties in this respect. There is 
a wonderful change that has taken 
place during the last decade, or so, 
in the character of the amusements 
that are being provided for us in 
the various communities in which 
we reside. The day of the legiti- 
mate drama has almost become ob- 
solete, and in its stead has sprung 
up the numerous moving picture 
shows and vaudeville. Many of our 
people, citizens of this and other 
states are wont to waste their time 
and means in frivolous amusements. 
Much of our time might be better 
occupied in studying the history of 
nations, the wars and the perplexi- 
ties, and the different subjects ex- 
pressed in the injunction that I have 
read to you, rathei than following 
the frivolous pursuits that many 
of our people are now indulging 
in. Pursuit of pleasure accomplishes 
nothing that is desirable, those who 
indulge therein show that they are 
at least mentally inactive or men- 
tally lazy. I am afraid many are 
not studying the scriptures as we 
ought, not studying history, and not 
informing ourselves upon the great 
plan of salvation that God has re- 
vealed for the salvation of His chil- 
dren. We should be faithful and 
energetic in our lives remembering 
that we are not living for ourselves 
alone, but that we should be work- 
ing also for the betterment and the 
conversion of the world to works 
of righteousness. If we are God's 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 



97 



people, as we claim that we are, 
then we are like a light set upon a 
hill that cannot be hid; the world 
is looking at us, and we should 
honor and magnify our calling. We 
should teach the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, not only by precept but also 
by example. 

I pray the Lord to bless us, to 
strengthen us in our work, give us 
a living testimony of its truth, that 
we may not only bear record on this 
one day in the year, that Jesus 
Christ has risen, but bear that tes- 
timony each of the 365 days of the 
year, that our lives may be exam- 
ples of righteousness, and that our 
skirts may be clear from the blood . 
of this generation, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O, say what is truth? Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can pro- 
duce ; 

And priceless the value of truth will be 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I trust my brethren and sisters, 
the few moments that I occupy this 
position that I may be influenced by 
the Spirit of the Lord, that our time 
spent here may be of mutual benefit, 
that we may enjoy the privilege we 
have of meeting together. 

I have listened with interest to the 
remarks of my brethren all during 
this conference. Out in the Cen- 
tral States, one of the worst winters 
that has ever been known in that 
country has just closed. From Dec. 



25th until two weeks ago we have 
had snow almost over the entire 
country, with the exception of the 
far south. In Independence, Mo., 
snow fell 26 inches deep two weeks 
ago this morning; it fell in a little 
more than twenty hours. These 
conditions have handicapped the 
missionary work in that section of 
the country to some extent. The 
people are suffering greatly. The 
southeastern portion of Missouri 
was, and I suppose it is now, under 
three feet of water, overflow from 
the Mississippi. The entire south 
land along that great river, unless 
something takes place in a few days 
to prevent, will be under water 
everywhere. The levees close to 
Memphis, Tenn., have given way. 
People are fleeing to the high 
ground. 

My thoughts at the time I visited 
in that section, concerning the con- 
ditions that exist there, along lines 
of industrial affairs were like these : 
How beautiful it would be if people 
living in this country understood the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and would migrate to a land where 
there is no danger of overflow, 
where they would not be tried and 
tempted with starvation. I tell von, 
in the homes of these people there 
are thousands that are not many 
meals ahead. Commercial clubs and 
other associations are gathering the 
people upon higher land, little 
knolls, and carrying them from 
there to places of safety. The Lord 
has greatly blessed the "Mormon" 
people. When He gave to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith revelation to 
lead this people to the Valleys of 
the Mountains, He understood ex- 
actly the conditions that would exist 
and the events that would happen, 
during the time that the members of

His Church would be working in or- 
der to prepare a people to receive 
Him. Joseph Smith's prophecies are 
being fulfilled. He said that the 
people would have to come to Zion 
for safety, and this is taking place. 
Men are leaving their homes for 
some cause or another, and lots of 
them are coming to this western 
country, because of the spring flood 
that is sweeping all through that 
country. People here do not under- 
stand what deep water is, really 
know nothing about it. When a 
stream of water as large as the 
Mississippi river bursts its banks 
it carries everything before it, cov- 
ering ten or fifteen miles of land, 
in some places 15 feet deep, Men, 
women and children have to leave 
everything that they have on earth, 
including their homes, perhaps for- 
ever, for when they return they may 
find them to have been swept away 
and the face of the country changed 
or removed entirely. 

As I contemplate these things, I 
wonder if we realize and under- 
stand the blessings that we enjoy 
here in this part of the country. 
The Saints have been given special 
privileges, revelations, and com- 
mandments that enable us to oter- 
come evils that prevail elsewhere ; 
and that we may live according to 
the light of truth the Lord has 
placed Prophets, Seers and Revela- 
tors among us. He has placed offi- 
cers in the church for the benefit 
of our children and for our benefit, 
that we might better observe the 
law and walk in the ways of the 
Lord. The Lord gave unto Moses 
commandments, and told him to 
teach the Israelites that that which 
the Lord had revealed was for them 
and for their children forever and 
ever, that they might observe the 



law. We send out missionaries in 
great numbers, and give much time 
and attention to the establish- 
ment of the purposes of the 
Almighty in the earth, both at 
home and abroad, but show me 
a man or a woman who has ever 
taken an active part in the "Mor- 
mon" church, for the establishment 
of the principles of righteousness, 
that has ever been the loser, either 
at home or abroad. I tell you the 
man who labors either in his ward, 
in his stake, or in the missionary 
field, enjoys the spirit and the power 
of the Lord that is not known 
among the children of men at all, 
they do not know what it is, they 
cannot comprehend the sweet spirit 
and influence that accompanies the 
Elder of Israel. 

During the past winter some El- 
ders in the Central States, who had 
faith that they could preach the 
gospel entirely without money, have 
lived out among the people in the 
severe Winter weather. When it 
was 20 degrees below zero, we told 
our boys to come into some town, 
and take care of themselves. I know 
some Elders who had faith enough 
to deliver the message of glad tid- 
ings and great joy, during this past 
winter labored all the time out in 
the country districts, and have not 
used any money, and have been 
taken care of all the time. We 
had two Elders awav out in West- 
ern Kansas, who had been sent out 
there by the conference president 
to visit some people who had writ- 
ten for the Elders to come to them, 
and the trains were blockaded and 
had not been moving for a week, 
and these boys went on sometimes 
as far in two days as a passenger 
train would run in one. It was a 
very remarkable thing. They were 



ELDER SAMUEL O.BENNION .

out in the country absolutely with- 
out friends, so far as they knew, 
but the Lord took care of them. I 
don't know of any people in the 
world who have greater evidences 
of God's favor given to them than 
have the Latter-day Saint Elders, 
either at home or abroad. I want 
to refer you to the 84th section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, the 
Lord has made a promise therein 
that is very wonderful, and that 
applies to any man who is called to 
carry the testimony of this Gospel 
into any land or clime, and under 
any circumstances, if he will do his 
duty as- a servant of the living Lord. 
He says : 

"Behold, I send you out to reprove 
the world of all their unrighteous 'deeds, 
and to teach them of a judgment which 
is to come ; and whoso receiveth you 
there will I be also, for I will go before 
your face, I will be on your right hand 
and on your left, and my spirit shall be 
in your hearts and mine angels round 
about you to bear you up. Whoso re- 
ceiveth you receiveth me, and the same 
shall feed you and clothe you an'd give 
you money, and he who feeds you or 
clothes you or gives you money shall in 
nowise lose his reward." 

Again : 

"Any man who will go and preach this 
Gospel of the kingdom and fail not to 
continue faithful in all things shall not 
be weary in mind, neither _ darkened, 
neither in body, limb nor joint, and a 
hair of his head shall not fall to the 
ground unnoticed ; and they shall not go 
hungry neither athirst." 

Now, the Father and the Son, ap- 
peared unto the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and he has testified to us and 
to the world that he saw two heav- 
enly personages, and the one ad- 
dressing the other, said: "This is 
my Beloved Son, hear Him." He 
testified this unto men who lived in 



his day. Men living in this day 
have heard these men testify that 
they heard the words of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. He has recorded his 
statements, and the Lord has given 
us this book of commandments for 
your good and for mine. When the 
call comes to go into the ward or 
abroad, no matter where, (to use a 
modern expression) "it is up" to 
that individual to receive the call, to 
prove whether he believes the word 
of the Lord or not, whether he is 
sincere or otherwise. 

I repeat, the "Mormon" people 
are the most blest of any people 
under the sun. This land of ours 
produces beautiful crops in abund- 
ance, that are not surpassed in the 
world. The valleys of the Nile are 
not any richer, if they are as rich 
as these valleys of the mountains. 
The Lord took His people out from 
Missouri, and He took them over 
the Mississippi and westward to 
this country, for a purpose, that He 
might establish them here, that they 
might grow in numbers and in- 
crease in faith until He could ac- 
complish through them His work of 
redeeming the souls of men from 
their fallen state. He sends forth 
men, at home and abroad, to bear 
testimony of Him, and declare the 
message of repentance and remis- 
sion of sins. He gave unto Hyrum 
Smith this commandment, that he 
should teach nothing but repentance 
unto this generation, and T tell you 
that the longer I live the more 
need I see for that doctrine to be 
preached. The Lord loves His chil- 
dren, men and women, in all the 
world. He organized the earth, 
and placed us here, and sent His 
Son, who did rise from the dead, 
that He might be Lord of the liv- 
ing and of the dead, and estab-

lished through Him the laws and 
ordinances by obedience to which 
we might return unto the Maker, 
by which we might govern our lives, 
and prepare ourselves for eternal 
life. 

The commandment and law con- 
tained in the 18th chapter of Mat- 
thew gives us to understand that 
there is more rejoicing in heaven 
over the return "of one sinner than 
over ninety and nine righteous. He 
spoke it in a parable so that we 
might understand it more easily. 
He said, I love mercy and not sacri- 
fice, I came into the world not to 
call the righteous but the sinners to 
repentance. As long as there is one 
son or daughter of His, one man who 
will listen unto His Gospel there 
will be His servants to preach it, for 
He loves His children more than 
any man can conceive. There will 
be no happiness in earth or heaven, 
among men or angels, without the 
redemption of the whole human 
family, and men can be redeemed 
only through becoming acquainted 
with what the Lord lias for us to 
do, as made known in His Gospel. 
He said, through the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, that no man can be 
saved in ignorance, and that that 
person who receives more knowl- 
edge and intelligence than another 
in this world would have that much 
the advantage in the world to come. 
All men will stand before God to be 
judged of the deeds done in the 
body. No man can escape the 
judgment of Almighty God, and 
that His judgment may be just, He 
has sent His Gospel that every liv- 
ing creature and every one who is in 
the spirit world, may receive the 
Gospel if they desire it, that they 
might learn for themselves and in- 
telligently select either to their ex- 



altation or their condemnation. We 
are told that some are resurrected 
unto life and some are resurrected 
unto condemnation, according to 
their works. The Savior said, "By 
their fruits ye shall know them ; a 
.good tree cannot bring forth evil 
fruit, neither a corrupt tree good 
fruit." 

I tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the longer this work con- 
tinues in the earth the stronger it 
grows. Our boys and girls at 
home, who may be a little careless, 
some may say, are worth taking 
care of; they have been located in 
this blessed land, and they are 
precious in the sight of God. I 
do not think that things happen 
by chance, or come by chance. I 
believe that the spirits of our chil- 
dren were ordained to come forth in 
this day and age of the world ; that 
it was understood by our Father in 
heaven, and their "times and their 
habitation," according to the Apos- 
tle Paul, was "aforetime appoint- 
ed." None of us come here by 
chance. These boys and girls who 
grow up here in this atmosphere, 
in this glorious land, are worth 
caring for. The principle of charity 
must and shall be exercised among 
our people until we shall be able 
to govern and control in righteous- 
ness. It is doubtful if any man 
would go astray if he knew in his 
own heart absolutely that it would 
result in his damnation, that it 
would destroy his soul. Men are 
influenced by environment, and by 
others of stronger will power, and 
often he himself is undoubtedly too 
easily led ; but the Lord is not will- 
ing, so Peter says, that any should 
perish, but that all should come 
unto Him, for, He said, "God is no 
respecter of persons, but in every

nation he that feareth Him and 
worketh righteousness is accepted 
of Him." 

I bear testimony that I know that 
God does live, and that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that the work of God 
is established here in the earth; 
and I know those men who stand 
at the head of this Church are 
God's noblemen. They were "afore- 
time appointed" among the great 
spirits that the Lord saw, accord- 
ing to Abraham, gathered together, 
when He said, "These I will make 
my rulers and my leaders." And 
I tell you they work. I saw an 
example of that in what Brother 
Grant did last fall, when he rode 
nearly across the continent to make 
one little speech, but an important 
one, that took him about an hour 
only. He left a field of labor where 
he was needed, and rode a long 
tiresome journey to fulfill another 
appointment whereunto he had been 
called. By their works these 
brethren keep you and me in line, 
and help us to grow better, and 
establish faith among the children 
of men. You should pray in your 
hearts that they may be sustained 
by the Spirit of the Lord. Men 
and women in a ward should pray 
for their Bishop, that he may have 
power, that he might have revela- 
tion given unto him for their bene- 
fit and the benefit of the ward, that 
all may enjoy the spirit of the Gos- 
pel as Latter-day Saints. Pray also 
for the president of the stake. Pray 
for the Church, and for the work 
of the missions in the world, that 
those who sit in darkness and un- 
belief may be led to the knowledge 
of the truth. Pray that we may 
leave nothing undone that would 
assist in bringing about the redemp- 
tion of mankind, and particularly 



that nothing may be done on our 
part that would hinder them from 
receiving the Gospel. Elders re- 
joice to know that you are praying 
for them. Some of them, when 
they go out unlearned and unac- 
customed to meeting men, are in- 
spired by your faith in your plead- 
ing to Almighty God. I pray that 
they may be brave fearless and 
strong, men of wisdom and of 
power, that they may feel the au- 
thority of their office and calling 
to the glorification of the Church, 
and be blessed of God, the Eternal 
Father, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 

(President of Granite Stake.) 

I have enjoyed exceedingly the 
sessions of the Conference, that 
which has been said, and the spirit 
that has accompanied the brethren 
who have been making remarks. 
The thought that has caused me to 
rejoice very much at this Confer- 
ence has been that suggested by the 
words of good cheer and hope that 
have been given us relative to the 
beauties of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I feel that there is, 
everything that is good, noble, pure 
and blessed connected with the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and I think that we ought to appre- 
ciate it, and comprehend it : and we 
ought to give glory to the Lord 
for the many blessings that we re- 
ceive under the teachings that come 
from the Gospel. 

I like the spirit that is optimistic 
about anything ; I am not impressed 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with a spirit that is pessimistic. I 
like to hear things well spoken of, 
and to hear men and women well 
spoken of. I have met very few- 
persons in my life but what I could 
see something good in them, some 
act they have done that was com- 
mendable ; and I have met this kind 
of a person in the world, who has 
the happy faculty of seeing the 
bright side of people's nature, and 
the good that is in them. How 
much happier we would be if we 
would practice this in our lives, and 
if we would do as Brother Bennion 
said we should do, speak well of 
those who preside over us. I think 
that we should never forget, on the 
Sabbath day or any other day, to 
speak about some of the beautiful 
things that are connected with the 
Gospel to those that we come in con- 
tact with. Especially ought this to 
be so in our family circles. There 
is virtue and beauty enough in this 
Gospel to delight everybody. When 
I get a little blue, and want to be 
cheered up, I go to the Scriptures, 
and I invariably get consolation 
and happiness reading the life of 
our Savior, for His life is enough 
to cause everybody in this world 
to rejoice, and see the beauties and 
blessings that life holds forth for 
us. I frequently take the Bible, or 
the Book of Mormon, and read of 
His mission upon this earth, of His 
ministry, and of His goodness; and 
it seems like that, in almost every 
word that He utters, there is a ser- 
mon that will benefit us in our lives, 
and we can at least find something 
there that will apply to us, for we 
need building up and increasing in 
our faith. 

I enjoyed the remarks of Presi- 
dent Smith, in the beginning of 
this Conference, wherein he showed 



forth to this people the beauties of 
this Gospel and the grand charac- 
ter of the man whom the Lord hon- 
ored in establishing it here in this 
generation, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; and when the song was be- 
ing sung so beautifully by Brother 
Russell relative to the Prophet Jo- 
seph (it happened to be my father, 
President John Taylor, who wrote 
this poem) when he said he "loved 
to dwell on his memory dear," how 
true that was ! While I have never 
seen the Prophet Joseph Smith, yet 
I believe that I have had his per- 
sonal appearance, even the color of 
his hair, pictured to me until, if I 
were an artist today, I believe I 
could paint his picture from the im- 
pression that my father gave me of 
that grand and noble man, when I 
was a little fellow at my father's 
knee, and as I grew older in years, 
because I dearly loved him. I never 
heard my father speak of him only 
as the most noble man that he had 
ever seen or known. I thank the 
Lord that he painted this picture 
to me, for I know from the impres- 
sions that he gave me, and from 
the Spirit of the Lord, that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was indeed a 
prophet of the Lord our God. 

I am thankful that, around our 
fireside, my father was accustomed 
to magnify the servants of the Lord 
in our sight, so that we love them, 
and honor and respect them. I 
thank the Lord when I look back 
upon the life of Brigham Young, 
that I saw in him everything con- 
nected with his life that was' meri- 
torious. If I could onlv practice 
the things that he taught and ex- 
amphfied it would make me a good 
man in life. I delight to know that 
around our fireside, the Prophet 
Brigham Young was magnified in 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



103 



our sight until we love his memory, 
and admire the beautiful character- 
istics of his soul. It is true also 
that, at my father's fireside, the 
other men that have held positions 
in the Church, were always held up 
to us as true and good and noble 
men. 

I want to say to this congrega- 
tion I believe it would be a good 
thing if we, at our firesides, were 
to magnify the men who are called 
to hold positions in the Church over 
us, so that the young people will 
be more likely to appreciate them. 
I testify that you will find enough 
that is good in these men, you find 
enough that is praiseworthy, so 
that you will save your boys and 
girls if they will be influenced to 
walk in their footsteps. I think we 
should follow this practice of seeing 
the good that is connected with the 
Gospel and the Priesthood of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and not take the 
statements of the world against our 
leaders. We should testify, our- 
selves, to the goodness that is within 
us, and let our boys and girls who 
are growing up in these valleys of 
the mountains know and feel that 
we have the truth, the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, that has been 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in its purity, and that there is 
everything in it to save them and 
make them noble and good, if they 
will follow in the practice thereof. 
I do think that it is right and proper 
that we should always, around our 
firesides and at our gatherings, 
speak of that which is good in our 
leaders, particularly before our chil- 
dren, and we ought not to be guilty 
of magnifying the faults, or imagi- 
nary failings, of these men or wom- 
en before our children and young 
people to their detriment or hurt. 



We should hold them up before our. 
young people so that when our boys 
and girls meet them on the street, 
or any place they may see them, 
they will look up to them and re- 
spect them. If we will do this, it 
will be a blessing to our children, 
and it will be pleasing in the sight 
of our Heavenly Father. I know, 
as far as I am concerned, that I 
have never at any time known men 
to speak ill of any of our leading 
brethren, but it has left a bitter taste 
in my mouth. I have pleasure in 
standing up for these men, because 
in them I know I can find virtue 
and truth, and I have rejoiced when 
I have stood up in their defense, for 
I felt like a man in doing so, and I 
feel that if I would be guilty of 
speaking evil of and defaming these 
men I would be a coward. 

We should teach this kind of 
principle in our gatherings, so that 
the Latter-day Saints who are hold- 
ing positions in the Church may be 
sustained, that they may have our 
faith and prayers, and that our 
young people should look up unto 
them with pride and respect. I can 
remember when I was a little fellow, 
when President Brigham Young 
used to take trips down to southern 
Utah for winter, and come back up 
here in the spring, with what pleas- 
ure, as Sunday school children, we 
used to line the streets and welcome 
back the prophet of the Lord. We 
were taught to look upon him as a 
prophet, and always honor him as 
such ; and I feel that this kind of 
faith should exist throughout the 
Latter-day Saints in all the world. 
We should not give credence to the 
reports of our enemies in connection 
with this people ; on the other hand, 
we should take pleasure and happi- 
ness in extolling their virtues, and 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



their goodness, so that our boys and 
girls might point to them with 
pride, and seeing one of them can 
point to him and say, "That is an 
Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ," 
and honor him in his place — "That 
is the President of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
a noble man." When our boys and 
girls are taught thus to look at him 
and see him, they will honor him in 
his place and in his position. 

I feel that it would be a splendid 
thing if, in all the households of 
the Church, all the people would 
honor those who preside in the 
Church, particularly in regard to 
our Bishops, men who are laboring 
faithfully and truly for the good of 
the people, who have no other object 
or purpose in view only the salva- 
tion of souls and the good of the 
people, How a Bishop would re- 
joice, and how he would enjoy his 
ministry, if all the people living 
within his ward would continually 
be patting him on the back and say- 
ing good things of him. He may 
have done many good things, but 
many of us are so critical that we 
observe only the bad thing that we 
imagine he has done ; if he stubs his 
toe he is sure to be noticed. We 
should set an example by which 
these men should be magnified in 
their position in the minds of the 
people. I was in one ward where 
the young people had been taught 
to take off their hats when they met 
the Bishop, and I thought how re- 
spectful it was when they met the 
Bishop on the street that they 
doffed their hats to the Priesthood 
— not to the man who occupied that 
place so much, but to the position 
and Priesthood that he held. I felt 
that they honored him in his place, 
and I tell you this Bishop had joy 



and happiness in his ministry, and 
he felt that the people were backing 
him as they should vlo. We owe it 
to them, my brethren and sisters, 
that we sustain, honor, and respect 
them, and that we labor with them 
to the very best advantage we can 
for the advancement of the work 
of the Lord. 

I think it is a splendid habit to get 
into, to say good things of our peo- 
ple, to say good things of our coun- 
try, of our nation. I was recently 
visiting a stake of Zion where the 
president of the stake has the happy 
faculty of seeing the pleasant side 
of everything in his stake, of the 
soil, of the people', of the horses 
and cows, of the climate and every- 
thing there is. I rejoiced to see that 
he had that kind of a spirit. I was 
recently in one of his meetings, and 
he pointed to a young man, and 
said, "Do you see that young man 
there?" "Yes." "He is the finest 
baritone singer in Utah," Pointing 
to another he said, "There isn't 
the equal of that young lady in play- 
ing the piano." And he saw the vir- 
tues of all of his people. He was 
visiting my home a while ago. He 
had a horse. He said, "Do you see 
that horse; it is the best puller in 
all our county." He had the habit 
of saying good things, and of see- 
ing the good in all that surrounded 
him. The result is that he sees the 
good that is in his people, and the 
nice things in all the young folks 
around him, and he is not accustom- 
ed to pointing out their faults and 
mistakes. I am sure there is 
enough virtue and goodness in peo- 
ple's lives here upon the earth that 
might make us happy all the time, 
if we will see it. There is enough 
virtue in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ that we can have much 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



105 



pleasure in our lives if we will con- 
template it and point it out. 

I think the Latter-day Saints 
ought to be reading these Scriptures 
at their fireside. They ought to be 
reading the history of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, so that our boys and 
girls may comprehend the goodness 
that was in him, and not be taken 
up with the falsehoods that are told 
about him by the people of the world, 
as well as about others of our lead- 
ers, which we read in newspapers, 
magazines and so on. I feel that we 
should offset this by showing up the 
virtue and the goodness of things 
around them. This should apply to 
our home, and all of our daily sur- 
roundings. What a beautiful home 
it should be, where the father is ac- 
customed to appreciate the beauty, 
pleasure, and happiness of his wife, 
and speak of it to his children, and 
magnify in his home, at his fireside, 
the virtues and graces of his wife. 
What a splendid thing it is when 
the wife is accustomed to stand up 
in defense of the husband, and 
speak of him in honor before the 
children, so that the children shall 
be accustomed to look upon their 
father with pride, to look up to him 
as the choicest and best and most 
noble man in the wide world. If we 
will do that, the Spirit of God will 
be in that home, peace will abide 
there, and the blessings of our 
Heavenly Father will attend the in- 
mates in that which they have. 
There is goodness and virtue enough 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. With- 
in these valleys of the mountains 
there is enough good soil and good 
principles for all of us, if we will 
only accustom ourselves to seeing 
them, happiness may thereby radiate 
from us all around. I like to see a 
man honor his home and honor his 



people. I like to see a man that is 
"for Utah." When I go out from 
here, I tell you I feel thankful when 
I re-cross the line and return to the 
home of my birth,. I am for Utah ; 
I am for the valleys of the moun- 
tains ; I am for the Latter-day 
Saints ; I am for the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and I am for all 
that is virtuous and good and true 
and noble in the world. I hope that 
I will not be guilty of pulling down 
my country; I hope that I will not 
be found guilty of speaking against 
those who preside in the nation ; I 
hope I will not be guilty of pulling 
down those who preside in the 
state, or the city wherein I dwell. 
I can find enough virtue and good- 
ness in them so that I can magnify 
them and help them out in their 
positions in my humble way, and I 
believe that this is what the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ expects 
of us. It is expected that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints shall be happy in the 
land where they dwell. It is ex- 
pected that they shall dwell in peace 
and happiness with their neighbors 
and friends. I hope that they will 
always seek to find in their neigh- 
bors, and in their friends, and in the 
land where they dwell goodness 
and virtue ; if they will, they will 
always be possessed of happiness 
within their soul. 

I hope that the Lord will give us 
of His Spirit, the spirit of this Con- 
ference, that we may go to our 
homes and speak good of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and that we may 
see and speak of the virtue in those 
who preside over us. I am sure 
that we can see splendid character in 
the man that presides over us at the 
present time. I love to be in his 
society. I love to see his pleasant 
countenance, and to observe his

kindness and his exemplary life. I 
know that he is a man of God, 
worthy of our faith and worthy of 
the support and defense of every 
man in Israel. I stand up for him ; 
I feel proud of him, from the crown 
of his head to the soles of his feet, 
and so with the others of our leaders 
in this Church. I feel proud that 
we have a man to preside over us 
who is like the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I am proud of our young 
men, our Utah boys. I don't care 
where these boys may be found, 
whether upon the s^a or upon the 
plains, or upon the mountains, or 
wherever their footsteps may take 
them, every boy that belongs to the 
Church of Jesus Christ will hold up 
his head and say, "I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ." They feel that it has 
power and spirit within it, and feel 
proud that they belong to such an 
organization, and that they are as- 
sociated with such a people as this. 

May the peace and blessings of 
God abide with us. and may we have 
a testimony ever burning within our 
souls, that this is the truth. I know 
that Jesus is the Christ ; I know 
that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of 
God, and that this work that we are 
engaged in is God's work, and will 
never fail. In the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDEE HEBER J. GRANT. 

The Father and the Son positively re- 
vealed in this age — The Spirit, and 
testimony of the truth, withdraw from 
transgressors. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
testimonies that have been borne 
to us during our Conference. I feel 
that we have had a time of rejoicing 
and that the Saints have been fed 
the bread of life. I rejoice in a 



knowledge of the Gospel and of the 
divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged. I rejoice that we have the 
testimony of the risen Redeemer 
given to us by men who have lived 
in our day. 

We find recorded in the 76th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants 
the following testimony: 

"For we beheld the glory of the Son 
on the right hand of the Father, and re- 
ceived of His fulness, and saw the holy 
angels, and they were sanctified before 
His throne, worshiping God and the 
Lamb, who worship Him forever. And 
now, after the many testimonies which 
have been given of Him, this is the testi- 
mony last of all, which we give of Him, 
that He lives, for we saw Him even on 
the right hand of God, and we heard the 
voice bearing record that He is the Only 
Begotten of the Father ; that by Him 
and through Him and of Him the worlds 
are and were created and the inhabitants 
thereof, and begotten sons and daughters 
of God." 

We are not dependent upon the 
testimony of men who lived many 
hundreds of years ago, but we have 
the testimony that is given to us 
from the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
from Sidney Rigdon that they saw 
the Son, that they heard the voice 
declare from the heavens that He 
was the only Begotten of the Fath- 
er, that by Him and of Him the 
worlds were created, and that He 
lives, for they saw Him. 

We rejoice in a knowledge of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We rejoice in those who have been 
faithful and diligent in serving Him, 
and in knowing that each and every 
individual who keeps the command- 
ments of God grows in the light 
and knowledge of the gospel. We 
rejoice in knowing that no man or 
woman ever loses the testimony of 
the divinity of this work in which 
we are engaged who keeps the com- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

mandments of God. To me one of 
the greatest and strongest evidences 
of the divine character of the work 
in which we are engaged, (so far 
as the natural faculties with which 
God has endowed me are able to 
comprehend and understand) is that 
as men become careless, become in- 
different, as they break the Word 
of Wisdom, as they neglect their 
meetings, as they fail to teach their 
children by precept and example 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
that they turn away from the faith, 
the Spirit of God is withdrawn from 
them, and they are left in darkness. 
If men and women could neglect 
the duties devolving upon them, if 
they could do those things that are 
forbidden, and still grow in the 
knowledge of the Gospel and the 
testimony burn in their hearts, it 
would stagger the reasoning fac- 
culties with which God has endowed 
me. On the contrary, I have dis- 
covered that when men serve Him 
and keep His commandments, that 
they grow in the knowledge of the 
truth, that they grow stronger and 
brighter through the rich outpour- 
ing of His Holy Spirit. 

I pray that all the remarks which 
have been made during this confer- 
ence for the benefit of the Latter- 
day Saints, the instructions and ad- 
monitions that have been given may 
sink deep into our hearts, that we 
may live honest lives before God, 
in "the payment of our tithing and 
meeting all our obligations to God 
and man ; that we may support and 
uphold our institutions to help build 
up the manufacturing interests of 
our state, and that we may be Lat- 
ter-day Saints in very deed, that the 
world, seeing our good deeds, may 
be led to investigate the Gospel and 
embrace the truth. 



I pray that all these teachings 
and instructions that have been 
given for the betterment of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints may find a lodgment 
in the hearts of those who have 
listened, and that the Saints may 
go forth from this conference with 
a determination in their hearts that 
they will serve God with more dili- 
gence in the future than they have 
ever done before ; this is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"Send out Thy Light," by Gou- 
nod, was rendered by the choir. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Wilford Woodruff. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

Thousands of people gathered on 
the Temple grounds, unable to ob- 
tain admission to the Tabernacle or 
Assembly Hall, and an outdoor 
meeting was held for their benefit, 
at 2 p. m., near the Bureau of In- 
formation building. The services 
were presided over by Elder Ben- 
jamin Goddard. Music was fur- 
nished by Prof. Wm. C. Give's or- 
chestra and Prof. Henry E. Giles 
organist, and Elder Alexander 
Campbell led the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn ■ 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But wth joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Alonzo P. Kesler

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDAED. 

(Supt. Bureau of Information.) 

Dear brethren and sisters, we are 
glad to have so many in attendance 
at Conference, and to have such in- 
terest and atttention manifested at 
our open air meeting. I trust that 
you will adapt yourselves to the pre- 
vailing conditions and not be rest- 
less. Some of our brethren are ac- 
customed to open air meetings, and 
usually, upon the street corners, 
have a moving congregation, from 
the fact that the people know not 
the Gospel and many are not inter- 
ested in their message. They often 
listen a little while and then move 
on. I trust that this will not be 
our experience today, we want you 
to stay with us. We realize the in- 
convenience of standing, but we be- 
lieve that in this open air meeting 
the Lord can bless us, and will bless 
us according to the earnest desires 
of our hearts, just as well as if we 
were comfortably seated in the Tab- 
ernacle or in the Assembly Hall. 

I made a remark a moment ago 
that reminded me of a little experi- 
ence. I venture to relate it to you, 
as it may indicate that even here, 
when we are meeting under ap- 
parently disadvantageous circum- 
stances, the Lord will bless us. Dur- 
ing a mission performed in New 
Zealand some time ago, I was im- 
pressed that even in moving congre- 
gations, while the elders are scat- 
tering the seed, the Word of God, 
some falls upon good ground, and 
later brings forth good fruit abun- 
dantly. Many elders in the mission 
field, who have been laboring zeal- 
ously in connection with the work 
to which they have been called, have, 
at times, been discouraged because 
they have apparently seen little 



fruit from their earnest efforts. 
Such may have been the feelings 
of certain elders in Great Britain 
nearly forty years ago. I do not 
know who the elders were. I sim- 
ply testify to the results of their 
work. 

A young couple, just married be- 
fore the time refered to, were pass- 
ing through the streets of an Eng- 
lish town on Saturday evening. 
They perceived a crowd on the 
street corner. The young woman 
desired to listen, and called her hus- 
band's attention to the meeting. 
"Oh," he remarked, we do not want 
to stop for a sermon tonight," but 
she insisted, and he stood with her, 
therefore for a short time. A 
young man was speaking. His 
name I do not know nor did they. 
The young man may not know the 
results of his labors until he reaches 
"the other side." But he was 
preaching the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and that sermon, that 
fervent address, was accompained 
by the Spirit of God, and the young 
woman felt the influence of it as 
she stood there in the crowd. She 
heard a few truths, not the fulness 
of the Gospel, but a little truth 
here and there, as uttered by the 
young elder. Finally her husband 
called her away and they rambled 
off, and did not hear another elder 
of the. Church for more than twenty 
years. At that time the British 
Government offered inducements 
for colonists to go to the antipodes, 
to Austrailia, New Zealand and 
Tasmania. The young couple took 
advantage of these offers and emi- 
grated to New Zealand, hoping to 
be thus benefited in securing a 
home. They located on the South 
Island, and soon made a clearing 
in the bush, removing the trees and 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 



109 



plowing the ground. Thus they 
started their new home, and com- 
menced to rear their little family. 
There were no elders in that locali- 
ty at the time, but twenty years 
after they heard the young elder 
in England, a newspaper reached 
their home from the most southern 
part of New Zealand, in which they 
read that two elders of the Mor- 
mon church had been holding meet- 
ings. The mother of the family 
exclaimed to her husband, "Those 
must be the same kind of people 
we heard before we left home." 
So much of the truth had sunk into 
their hearts that they had not been 
able to affiliate with any other 
church, having found nothing to 
satisfy the craving of their souls. 

Accordingly the husband wrote 
asking the two elders to visit them. 
The elders did so, walking over 
one hundred miles in order to find 
the obscure dwelling in the bush. 
They found the father the mother 
and a large family of children ready 
to receive their message. They 
taught the same principle? listened 
to in the English town so long, long 
ago. The family embraced the Gos- 
pel, every member joined the 
Church, and subsequently they 
gathered to Zion. In Salt Lake 
Temple the husband and wife were 
sealed for time and eternity. The 
children received their blessings 
there ; and today the oldest son is 
back in New Zealand, the land of 
his birth, preaching the same Gos- 
pel. I refer to this for the encour- 
agement of any of our elders, or 
any of the Saints, who in their weak- 
ness, have borne testimony to the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
This is God's work. He recognizes 
our labors and will give the reward. 
Paul may plant, Apollos may water 



but "God giveth the increase." The 
young elder preaching thus in Great 
Britain nearly forty years ago may 
have returned to his home discour- 
aged, disheartened, not having seen 
the fruits of his labors. And yet, 
in the great hereafter, when "every 
man is rewarded according to his 
•works," when "the books are open- 
ed" and every man receives his re- 
ward, when the sheaves are gath- 
ered in, it will not be a family but 
a multitude of people brought into 
the Church through the humble ef- 
forts of the elder upon the streets 
so long ago. 

I therefore bear testimony to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that 
God has a blessing for us in this 
meeting. The Prophet of God has 
called these brethren to talk to us 
and, under the inspiration of the 
Almighty, we shall be blessed and 
strengthened in our faith, and we 
shall continue to partake of the 
good influence that has character- 
ized all the Conference meetings 
thus far, for I feel that all the ad- 
dresses have been faith promoting 
and soul inspiring. I pray that the 
Lord will bless us in this gather- 
ing, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 

(President of Wayne Stake.) 

In the summer of 1890 a young 
missionary in England was about to 
emigrate to this country, having 
filled a local mission of two and a 
half years. He had left the home 
of a sorrowing mother and his 
brothers and sisters, whom he might 
never meet again in this life. He 
was on his way to the railroad to 
take the train that would take him 
to his destination, where he would 
board the ship to bring him to Zion,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



As he passed the market place of 
the little town through which he 
was passing, there was gathered a 
congregation similiar to the one that 
is here this afternoon, excepting, 
doubtless, that they were very much 
divided in their opinions and reli- 
gious conviction. The Salvation 
Army soldiers were preaching up- 
on the streets, -and had attracted 
a large congregation. The young 
man was attracted to the place, and 
stopped to listen. He remained for 
about five minutes, during which 
time this religious body sang a 
number of songs, made a collection, 
and retired without preaching any 
of their doctrines, but inviting the 
congregation to accompany them to 
their place of worship, to the "bar- 
racks," as they termed it. The 
young man left on his way to the 
railroad station, as he had very 
little time left to catch the train. 
But an impression came over him 
that it was his duty to return, mount 
the steps of the monument that had 
been occupied by the leaders of this 
religious sect, and preach to the 
congregation that had been gath- 
ered. He immediately yielded to the 
impressions of the Spirit, and re- 
turned. He was impressed, first of 
all, to quote the words of Isaiah the 
prophet that the Gospel was with- 
out money and without price ; and 
the declaration that he made seem- 
ingly attracted the congregation, 
and they remained. Many others 
gathered, and for some time the 
young man, under the influence of 
the Spirit of the Lord, preached the 
Gospel of repentance and baptism 
for the remission of sins. The peo- 
ple were attentive. The Spirit of 
the Lord was present. The message 
of truth was carried home to many 
a heart. Some of the religious 



body that had 'been 'holding the 
meeting remained behind to lis- 
ten to the young man, and when he 
got through with his service, they 
were anxious to get him into de- 
bate, to destroy, if possible, the 
good effect of the meeting; but 
many of the people that were pres- 
ent impressed by the good Spirit 
of the Lord, came to the rescue of 
the young Elder and declared that 
he had spoken the truth in plain- 
ness, that he had preached,the Gos- 
pel as contained in the Bible, and it 
was not necessary for him to be de- 
tained longer, as his train would 
soon leave. So he was excused 
Ten years later that young Elder, 
after gathering to this country and 
becoming established, was called on 
a mission to his fatherland. He re- 
turned to proclaim the gospel, as 
he had done to the people in that 
country . ten years previously. It 
was his pleasure to visit that little 
town. For some years no mission- 
ary work had been done in that sec- 
tion of the country ; but, about two 
years before his return, the Elders 
had been sent there, and many of 
the people who were present at the 
open air meeting preached to by 
that young Elder when he was im- 
pressed as I have related, by the 
Spirit of the Lord, had gathered 
into the fold, and a very prosperous 
little branch of the church had been 
raised up in that part of the Lord's 
vineyard. When Brother Goddard 
was telling the experience that he 
was relating to you, I thought of 
this little incident that happened in 
Great Britain. 

The Latter-day Saints are often 
accused by their enemies of hero 
worship. When they sing that soul- 
inspiring song that we have sung 
this afternoon, many who are op- 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY 



111 



posed to the Church that has been 
restored to the earth, accuse the 
Latter-day Saints of worshiping 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. There 
can be nothing farther from the 
truth than an accusation of that 
kind. True it is, that the Latter- 
day Saints honor and revere the 
memory of Joseph Smith, and why 
not? If God, the Eternal Father, 
should condescend to honor and 
bless this man, why should his fol- 
lowers hesitate to give honor and 
praise where honor and praise are 
thus manifestly due? Do we not 
reverence the name of Moses? Do 
we not speak in respect with re- 
gard to all the prophets who have 
so earnestly labored to uplift and 
save mankind ? Did not Jesus Christ 
Himself, the Son of the living God, 
magnify the prophets who had pre- 
ceded Him? Did He not refer in 
terms of respect to the ancient 
prophets? Did He not give God 
the Father glory and praise for the 
work that the prophets had accom- 
plished in their day and time? Then 
why should not the Latter-day 
Saints speak in honor and praise 
of the man who lived and died for 
the principles that our Father re- 
vealed for the salvation and glory 
.of the human race? When we 
are accused of worshiping Joseph 
Smith we are accused wrongfully. 
We believe in Jesus Christ. We be- 
lieve that He was the only begotten 
Son of the Father. We believe that 
He was sent into this world to do 
as He declared, not His own will, 
but the will of His Father, who had 
sent Him. He came into the world 
to restore the truths that had been 
lost by reason of the fact that the 
people were unwilling to accept the 
prophets, and had disregarded their 
message. 



It must be remembered that there 
was a period of something like four 
hundred years from the coming of 
Malachi, from the time of his ad- 
ministration among the people to 
the coming of John the Baptist, and 
during that time there had been an 
absence, so to speak, of communica- 
tion between God and man. No 
prophet came forward declaring 
"Verily verily, this is the way, walk 
ye in it." Those of you who are 
familiar with the Scriptures will re- 
member the conditions that obtained 
in the days of Malachi, the spirit 
of apostasy that was rife among 
God's chosen people, and how Mal- 
achi verbally chastised them because 
of their unbelief, and because of 
their turning away from the truth, 
and predicted what would befall 
them as a result of departing from 
the truth and ignoring the message 
that the prophets had brought them ; 
and this was the condition when the 
Son of God came. This was the 
condition when John the Baptist 
made his appearance. Hence he 
and the doctrine he preached were 
not popular. John the Baptist and 
the Savior were just as unpopular in 
their day as was the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in the day when he came. 
The body of believers who came in- 
to the fold, who were received into 
the Church of Christ by baptism 
were just as unpopular in the land 
of Judea, among God's own chosen 
people, as are the Latter-day Saints 
unpopular in this glorious country 
today, and in all the countries 
whithersoever they may be scattered 
declaring their truths. 

Jesus came with this message, 
that He had been sent of the Father. 
He complained because of the un- 
belief of the people. The people 
professed to believe in Abraham 



J 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and in the prophets. Jesus told 
them that if they believed in Abra- 
ham they would do the works of 
Abraham. He simply repeated the 
truth as the prophets had before de- 
clared it and made known the fact 
that He had been entrusted with a 
special mission : He had been sent of 
the Father to preach repentance and 
to establish righteous laws and prin- 
ciples among the people ; and He 
declared this truth "I am the way, 
the truth, and the life, and no man 
cometh to the Father but by me." 
The Latter-day Saints believe that 
Jesus was the light of the world. 
They believe that He did teach the 
truth. They believe that He had 
the authority and power to give 
laws to the people, even the law of 
His Father, which is the law of the 
Church by which all men come to 
a knowledge of the truth. 

It has never been asserted by 
Joseph Smith, or any of his fol- 
lowers, that there was any virtue, 
any power, any authority, in this 
prophet of God except such as had 
come down from the heavens. Jo- 
seph Smith did not preach his own 
doctrine, but he taught the people to 
believe in the law of Jesus Christ, 
he taught faith in God the Eternal 
Father, and in His Son, Jesus 
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. He 
taught that all men will be punished 
for their own sins and not for 
Adam's transgression He declared 
that through the atonement of 
Christ, all mankind may be saved 
by obedience to the ordinances of 
the Gospel. He declared that the 
laws and ordinances of the Gospel 
are ; First, Faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ ; Second, Repentance ; Third, 
Baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins ; and Fourth, the 
laying on of hands for the gift of 



the Holy Ghost. He proclaimed 
that men must be called of God by 
prophecy and by the laying on of 
hands by those who are in author- 
ity, to preach the Gospel and admin- 
ister in the ordinances thereof — 
and so we might go through all the 
Articles of Faith of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and we would not find one idea ex- 
pressed that could lead to the con- 
clusion that the Latter-day Saints 
have any other Savior than the 
Redeemer of the world, the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

But I believe, my friends, that the 
trouble with the world today, as it 
has ever been, is that they want to 
make excuses, they want to excuse 
themselves for not obeying the 
truth, on some premises that never 
existed. Joseph Smith magnified 
the Redeemer of the world more 
than any other individual, I be- 
lieve, that has ever lived in these 
last days. How could he do that by 
the simple truths and principles that 
he taught? He did it by the un- 
blemished and pure life that he 
lived. Fie did it by the testimony 
that he bore to the world. And he 
did it by willingly giving his life in 
evidence of the principles that he 
had declared he had received from 
God the Father. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
and beloved friends who may not 
be members of the "Mormon" 
Church, let me ask you to consider 
carefully where you stand this aft- 
ernoon. T think I can read upon 
the faces of this congregation that 
we have been gathered from the 
east and from the west, from the 
north and from the south, and have 
come up in obedience to the com- 
mands of the living God that we 
might learn of His ways, and that 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY . 



113 



we might walk in His paths. May 
I appeal to you this afternoon that 
you forget not your first love for 
the Gospel. May I ask that we con- 
tinue to investigate those principles 
that were revealed to us in our fatb> 
crland. May I plead with you that 
you contend earnestly for the faith 
that was once delivered to the 
Saints. 

I was delighted, in the opening 
session of this Conference, to hear 
the testimony of President Joseph 
F. Smith. The truth of his testi- 
mony found echo in my heart, 
when he said that the statement 
often made by our enemies, and 
perhaps inadvertently made some- 
times by Latter-day Saints who go 
by outside appearances, that the 
Church of Christ is losing in spirit- 
uality and becoming intrenched in 
what the world calls "commercial- 
ism," was not true. I was delighted 
with the testimony he bore that the 
Latter-day Saints are making good 
in faith in God, in repentance ; that 
they are not losing in spiritual gifts 
and in power. I believe that some 
are losing, but it is they who are 
not keeping the commandments of 
God. I can bear testimony in my 
experience, in my ministry, that 
faith in God is on the increase. I 
know that to be the case in the lit- 
tle stake where I live and preside. 
I know that by the power of God 
the sick are healed as they ever were 
in the time of the historv of this 
Church, or in the Church of Christ 
anciently. I know that sinners who 
repent and come unto Christ and 
are baptized, having contrite hearts 
and a humble spirit, receive the tes- 
timony of the Redeemer as they 
ever did, and they know that Jesus 
lives. They know that Joseph 
Smith was His prophet. They 



know that the Church of Christ is 
with men, with all its gifts and pow- 
ers and blessings. I know that 
when men are humble, and trust in 
God, that He inspires them by His 
Spirit when they are called to ad- 
dress the congregations of the peo- 
ple. If they do not have the elo- 
quence of orators, if they do not 
have the reasoning ability of great 
men, they have the testimony of 
Christ, which is the spirit of proph- 
ecy, which bears record to those 
who are honest and sincere, that 
they speak the truth. That is my 
individual and personal testimony. 

I thank God for the testimony 
that is within me. I am grateful 
for what God has revealed to me, 
and for what he has revealed to you, 
and for His Spirit that testifies to all 
the Church when men speak by its 
influence and power, that they are 
operating under that influence. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, 
may we be loyal to the faith. May 
we be true to one another. May 
we be true to the covenants we have 
made with God no matter where our 
lot may be cast, no matter what our 
occupation may be. Wherever we 
may be, whatever we are doing, let 
us be careful that every thought 
and every act of our lives is an evi- 
dence and a testimony to the 
world that we believe that Jesus is 
the way, the truth, and the light, 
and that we have accepted the way, 
and that we are walking in the 
light, and have received the testi- 
mony of the Spirit. 

May the Lord bless us ; and as 
we return from this Conference, 
may we go forth with renewed en- 
ergy and desire to serve the Lord. 
May we sustain in every thought 
and every word and every act of 
our lives those principles for which

the prophets, ancient and modern, 
have lived and died. May we sus- 
tain the leader of this Church, 
whom God has called to direct - in 
this last dispensation, by our faith 
and our works, and thus aid in 
bringing to pass the day when 
Jesus, the Prince of Glory and 
Peace, shall come to trie earth, and 
when He shall reign and peace and 
righteousness shall be established. 

"Hail, Savior, Prince of Peace, 

Thy kingdom shall increase 

Till all the worl'd thy glory see 

And righteousness abound 

As the great deep profound, 

And fill the earth with purity." 

May God grant this in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER SYLVESTER a. CANNON. 

(Of the Presidency of Pioneer Stake.) 

This is a new experience for me, 
my brethren and sisters and friends, 
to address an outdoor gathering. 
I have had the privilege of perform- 
ing two missions in foreign lands, 
but in both cases they were in fields 
where outdoor preaching is not al- 
lowed. I have attended but one 
outdoor meeting during my mis- 
sionary experiences, and T had at 
that time no opportunity of addres- 
sing those who were present. I 
rejoice in the spirit of this meeting, 
and I trust that I may be able 
to say something that will be of 
an edifying nature to those present. 

While we were singing the first 
hymn this afternoon, my mind was 
led to reflect upon the conditions 
under which that hymn was writ- 



ten, and also the conditions which 
prevail today as compared with 
that time, — the hymn "Come, Come, 
Ye Saints, No toil nor labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way." 
This hymn was written under cir- 
cumstances, as most of you know, 
in which the people, of whom we 
form a part, were in a situation 
of a desperate character. They 
had been despoiled of their goods, 
thev had suffered privations, they 
had been driven from their homes ; 
many of their friends and relatives 
had passed away as a result of the 
oersecutions they had to endure ; 
and they were in the midst of pri- 
vation, disease, and suffering, in the 
middle of the winter. Wm. Clay- 
ton, who belonged to the Church 
at that time of deep distress, wrote 
this hvmn as an encouragement to 
the Saints to prepare for the emi- 
gration to this country, at that time 
a wilderness. 

Now, in considering the condi- 
tions that surround us here, and the 
nrogress that has been made, I have 
been led to reflect upon the power 
of faith in the hearts of those who 
were a oart of this Church at that 
time. I was led to reflect unon the 
declaration of Paul, as contained 
in the eleventh chanter of bis Kois- 
th to the ^T^brews, where he says, 
"Now faith is the substance of 
thinp-s honed for. the evidence of 
things not seen :" and in that chap- 
ter he p-n«s on to illustrate the now- 
er of faith. I shall read onlv a few 
of the statements that he makes in 
that chanter. "For bv it ( faith) 
the elders obtained a good reoort. 
Through faith we understand that 
the worlds were framed bv the 
word of God, so that thing's which 
are seen were not made of things 
which do appear — But without faith 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON.

it is impossible to please Him: for 
he that cometh to God must be- 
lieve that He is, and that He is a 
rewarder of them that diligently 
seek Him." He goes on to tell of 
the faith of Noah, Abraham, and all 
those who were faithful men in the 
sight of God, men who accom- 
plished things for the progress of 
His work and were mighty men of 
old. Now, we believe that a sys- 
tem of faith or religion that is not 
able to influence and establish in 
the hearts of its devotees a living 
faith, a faith sufficient to enable 
people to endure all things, to sac- 
rifice all things, for the love of that 
religion, for the love of God, and 
sacrifice, if need be, their own lives, 
is not sufficient to bring men and 
women to salvation. It is necessary 
that people should have a faith suf- 
ficient to enable them to do every- 
thing, to sacrifice, if it were neces- 
sary, everything they possess for 
the love of the truth, for the love 
of God, in order that they may be 
able to obtain His favor and bless- 
ing. 

We believe, in order to obtain 
salvation, it is necessary that men 
should have an idea that God ac- 
tually exists, that men should have 
an understanding and an assurance 
that the course of life they are pur- 
suing is in accordance with the will 
of God. If men have this under- 
standing, these ideas, then they are 
on the way to salvation. Now, if 
men have the belief that God ex- 
ists, they also must have an idea 
of His character, His perfection, 
and His attributes, they must un- 
derstand that God is indeed a God 
of mercy, of justice, of omnipo- 
tence, that He loves His children, 
that He is unchanging, the same 
yesterday, today, and forever, that 



He desires that all men should come 
unto Him, and live in accordance 
with His will, that they may obtain 
His favor and blessings. 

If men understand that God has 
made known, at various times in 
history, His will, and has under- 
taken to send men authorized of 
Him to proclaim His will, to make 
known that which He desires of 
mankind, to call them to live in 
accordance therewith, we can then 
perceive that it is necessary that 
men should undertake to submit 
their own will, desires and inclina- 
tions to the will of God. If they 
do this, they will pursue a course 
of life that is in harmony with the 
will of the Lord, in accordance with 
the commandments which He has 
made known ; and, in pursuing that 
course throughout their lives, they 
will eventually obtain salvation in 
the presence of God, our Eternal 
Father. 

If mankind come to the condition 
of mind that they feel assured that 
God lives, they then understand 
that they can worship Him, they 
can understand His attributes, His 
character, and perfections, they can 
approach Him, and are able to ask 
Him for blessings, and seek to live 
in accordance with that which they 
feel He desires. As they grow in 
faith, as they develop a living faith, 
they will be able to sacrifice all that 
they possess for the love of the 
Lord, because of the fact that they 
have an assurance that He is wil- 
ing to bless them ; and through that 
faith and devotion they will obtain 
salvation. 

The Latter-day Saints have ac- 
cepted a faith which is indeed this 
living faith. It requires of men and 
women the sacrifice, if necessary, 
of their positions for the love of

God and for the advantage of His 
work. We have accepted it with 
that understanding. The Gospel 
of Jesus Christ at all times, in all 
ages when it has been upon the 
earth, of which we have any record 
in sacred history, has required of 
men and women that they should 
give themselves wholly and com- 
pletely to the service of the Lord, 
that they should be willing to sub- 
mit their desires, feelings and in- 
clinations to the will of the Lord, 
and undertake to do His will as 
He has made it known. The great- 
est exemplar of this doctrine is the 
Savior Himself, the only Begotten 
Son of the Father, who came upon 
the earth to do the will of the 
Father. He was willing to submit 
Himself, even though He was one 
of the Godhead, to do that which 
God the Eternal Father had given 
Him to do. He came upon the 
earth and performed a wonderful 
mission, the mission which He was 
called to perform, the atonement. 
Although He was free to do that or 
not as He chose, He was willing in 
the hour of suffering, the very hour 
when the greatest sacrifice had to be 
made, to say, "Nut my will but 
thine be done." He accomplished 
that atonement ; He drank that cup 
of bitterness. He passed through 
death, and suffering such as men 
have never endured upon the earth, 
and was resurrected from the dead 
without His body having seen cor- 
ruption. He was resurrected to 
eternal life, and triumphed over 
death, and became the mediator be- 
tween men and God, whereby men 
also, through following in His 
footsteps, endeavoring to live as He 
lived, and to observe the principles 
and doctrines He established^ may 
also come unto God and walk in the 



way to salvation. Through perse- 
verance along this course, men and 
women will obtain salvation in the 
presence of our Father. 

This doctrine of the Church of 
Latter-day Saints is indeed a liv- 
ing faith, founded upon the princi- 
ples of which I have spoken. It is 
necessary that men should have an 
idea that God actually exists. We 
have abundant evidences, before we 
join this Church, that God does ex- 
ist, from various sources. We 
have it from tradition, we have it 
from sacred history, we have it 
from natural evidences. We can 
also in our own being feel that, in- 
asmuch as we live upon earth and 
have being, there is one above us 
who is powerful, by whom all things 
have been created, and under whose 
guiding hand all things are regu- 
lated and controlled. We can under- 
stand the existence of a Supreme 
Being, through investigating the 
principles of the Gospel, as Jesus 
taught them, and as they are taught 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. We can there- 
by obtain an understanding of the 
eternal nature of God. of His at- 
tributes, perfections and being. The 
Gospel teaches us that we . are 
created in very deed in His image, 
that we lived before we came here, 
in the spirit ; that we will exist 
after we leave this earth, and will 
be rewarded according to the deeds 
done in the body. 

Now, the principles and doctrines 
of the Church of Christ, as stated 
by Brother Eckersley, are clear and 
easily understood. This is the sub- 
stance of what I wish to say : Every 
principle, every ordinance, every 
doctrine, that is promulgated by 
the Latter-day Saints is entirely in 
harmony with, in fact, are exactly 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON. 



the same as were preached by the 
Lord Jesus Christ and His apostle* 
They are in exact harmony witu 
every principle that is contained 
in this Holy Bible; every 
principle and every doctrine that we 
believe in can be shown from the 
book itself, to be correct and in 
accordance with the Bible. 

The Savior's disciples were told 
when He was leaving them, after 
He was resurrected, to "go into 
the world and preach the Gospel to 
every creature, he that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved and 
he that believed not shall be 
damned, and these signs shall fol- 
low them that believe, In my 
name they shall yeast out devils. 
They shall lay their hands upon the 
sick and they shall be healed." And 
many other signs of which He 
spoke should follow them that be- 
lieved ; they should receive of these 
gifts and blessings according to 
their faith. The Latter-day Saints 
believe in these things ; they believe 
that God is the same yesterday, to- 
day, and forever. They believe 
that the doctrines which the Savior 
taught are and were the true prin- 
ciples of eternal life, and that, in 
order to be saved, mankind must 
accept these principles and obey 
them, in every period of the world's 
history, if they are to obtain salva- 
tion. And they must be taught 
these principles. These principles 
must be declared, and these ordi- 
nances performed, by men who are 
duly authorized of the Lord, in or- 
der that they may be recognized 
and sealed in heaven by our Eternal 
Father ; otherwise they are of no 
avail. I repeat, they are not ef- 
ficacious unless they are in accord- 
ance with His will, and performed 
by those who are duly sent and 



authorized to perform them. The 
Latter-day Saints have accepted 
these principles. The Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, of whom we have heard 
this afternoon, and in whom we be- 
lieve as having been a prophet of 
the Lord, received them from 
heaven by revelation from God, and 
the principles which he taught are 
entirely in harmony with the prin- 
ciples contained in the Scriptures. 
This harmony is evidence that the 
principles which he taught were re- 
vealed from heaven. Joseph Smith 
was not qualified of himself, any 
more than any uninspired man is 
qualified, to make up a system of 
religion corresponding in every par- 
ticular with the doctrines, princi- 
ples, and ordinances which the 
Savior taught and established, and 
which were promulgated by His 
apostles after His death and resur- 
rection. 

Every principle and doctrine and 
ordinance in this Church is for the 
betterment, for the development of 
mankind, and there is in it princi- 
ples, doctrines, and commandments 
for the improvement of every side 
of the human character. This of 
itself is a testimony to me of the 
divinity of this work. Among other 
things the people called Latter-day 
Saints have received what is called 
the Word of Wisdom. It was re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
many years ago, long before the 
world, or even the learned men, ex- 
cept in a few instances, had de- 
clared the injury that would come 
to the human body through indul- 
gence in tobacco, strong drinks and 
other articles of a narcotic and 
stimulating nature. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith declared that these 
things were harmful; he received 
this word from the Lord by revela-

tion. He advocated moderation in 
all things, temperance in every- 
thing; that men should not run to 
extremes in any particular, but en- 
deavor to be moderate and temper- 
ate under all circumstances. We 
find today that men are coming to 
accept and advocate the identical 
principles that were declared many 
years ago by revelation from the 
Lord. Recently we had in our 
midst a renowned authority on 
health, on the human body, on 
those principles which go to make 
up healthy, strong men and women. 
If any of us who are believers in 
the doctrines of the Gospel had 
closed our eyes, and not known who 
was speaking, we would have de- 
clared that he was teaching the 
doctrines of "Mormonism" with re- 
• gard to those things which concern 
the body; because he proclaimed 
principles which have been familiar 
to the Latter-day Saints for many 
years. They are now getting to be 
understood by the rest of the people 
of the world as necessary for human 
welfare. 

The Latter-day Saints believe in 
virtue, morality. We understand 
that men and women cannot remain 
true, cannot have a living faith in 
God if they are immoral, if they 
are unvirtuous in thought, in word, 
or in act. It is necessary that we 
should be true and pure in order to 
obtain the blessings of the Lord, 
in order that the Spirit of God may 
be with us and inspire us. We be- 
lieve these things ; we know these 
things. I know, and I desire to tes- 
tify to every one who is present, 
that men and women cannot remain 
in this Church unless they are pure, 
unless they are virtuous, unless they 
are upright in morals and every 
other thing. Men and women will 



apostatize from the Church if they 
become unvirtuous. It is one of the 
principles of this Gospel that we 
must live pure lives ; unless we do 
it we cannot be temples of the Holy 
Spirit. 

We believe, as Latter-day Saints, 
in the law of tithing. The leaders 
of this Church have been accused 
of misusing the funds that are paid 
as tithing by the Latter-day Saints, 
because they teach this law, which 
was revealed to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith many years ago. Those 
critics do not understand the fact 
that practically all of the money 
thus paid by the Latter-day Saints 
is returned to them in a way that 
they will get the benefit of it. Those 
present at a meeting in the Taber- 
nacle the other night heard state- 
ments read of the money expended 
in the work that is being done by 
this Church for the benefit of the 
people. It was shown that from 50 
per cent to 90 per cent of all that 
is donated by the Latter-day Saints 
is returned to them, in their various 
stakes and wards, for their own 
benefit. It was shown also that in 
addition to this directly, that there 
was a very large amount of money 
expended for the benefit of those in 
need of charity, suffering or lacking 
for the necessities of life. It was 
shown also that a very large 
sum is expended year by year 
for purposes of education among 
the Latter-day Saints, for teaching 
our young people principles which 
go to develop men and women 
educationally, and also in the 
theology, the understanding of 
the principles of the Gospel. We 
believe in teaching theology in our 
schools, as well as other principles 
which pertain to life, which are a 
part of the proper education of 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON.

mankind. The Church is assisting, 
by its tithing fund, in performing 
a wonderful work in the way of 
missionary labor — such a work as 
has never been seen upon the face 
of the earth before. It has been 
taken as an ideal by many of the 
ministers in the world today. I 
know of many prominent men, in 
various churches, who point to the 
missionary system of the Latter- 
day Saints as being the ideal sys- 
tem, because it is the system which 
was inculcated and established by 
the Savior when He was upon the 
earth, when He sent His disciples 
out and said to them, Go out into 
all the world and preach the Gospel 
without money and without price. 
Preach the Gospel freely to all 
mankind ; and he that believes the 
Gospel and is willing to submit his 
will to the Lord, and will develop 
a faith in God and submit himself 
to do the will of God, shall receive 
a testimony of it, and will obtain 
salvation through perseverance 
therein. 

The work in which we are en- 
gaged is of such a nature that it is 
constructive. It is not merely a 
system of principles or theories, but 
it develops, as I stated, a living 
faith in the hearts of the people, 
whereby they are willing to go, if 
necessary, to the ends of the earth 
to accomplish that which is made 
known to them as being, the will of 
the Lord. Young men and young 
women have been called to leave 
their homes to go out into all parts 
of the world to preach the Gospel, 
to spend two, three, or more years 
in this work, at their own expense, 
without receiving monetary help 
from the Church, sacrifice their 
time and means, and leave families 
for this purpose. They have done 



so, and they testify to hundreds of 
thousands of people of the divinity 
of this work. The people have left 
their eastern homes, having been 
driven therefrom, through persecu- 
tion, into a wilderness a thousand 
miles from civilization, and in the 
midst of that wilderness, have de- 
veloped and established a system 
of community life that is unpar- 
alleled anywhere in the world today, 
a community life that is praised 
highly by people everywhere. If 
we work this out to its ideal con- 
dition, as we eventually will, it 
will be indeed the perfection and 
ideal that all people can point to 
with praise. The people have been 
constructive in their character as 
a result of the faith that they have 
espoused, and they work together 
in unity and harmony. The people 
were able to settle differences when 
they were all of one faith ; there 
were few quarrels ; everything was 
arbitrated. The courts did very lit- 
tle in the way of settling difficulties. 
They were settled peaceably,without 
expense, and without hard feelings 
toward each other, because the peo- 
ple were united. These things are 
evidences of the fact that this is 
more than a mere system of 
theories. It is a system of life. It 
includes principles whereby men 
and women may learn how to live ; 
and that is the reason and object 
of our being, that we shall learn to 
live upon the earth as the Lord de- 
sires of us, that we may know how 
to live in eternity, when we leave 
this existence. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the testimony of the truth. I 
know that this work that was estab- 
lished under divine direction by Jo- 
seph Smith, was and is, indeed, "the 
power of God unto salvation" of all 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that will believe and obey it. It is 
a system whereby men and women 
may come to know the Lord, and 
obtain a testimony in their hearts 
that it is true, that it is divine, that 
God has established this work to 
remain, endure, and continue, to 
prepare the way for the coming of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. I know 
also, that not only was Joseph 
Smith a prophet of the Lord, that 
not only was he authorized of God 
to establish this work upon the 
earth, but that every man who has 
succeeded him in the presidency of 
the Church, every man who has 
been called to labor in the ministry 
and Priesthood, has been endowed 
with power from on high, inasmuch 
as he has endeavored to labor ac- 
cording to the will of the Lord. I 
know that these men who have suc- 
ceeded the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in this Church, as prophets, seers, 
and revelators, have been and are 
indeed inspired men. I rejoice in 
the fact that this is the case, that 
this work has continued, that there 
has been no break in the rightful 
succession in the presidency of this 
Church, and that we have at the 
head of the Church today a man 
who is indeed inspired of the Lord, 
endowed from on high, empowered 
by our Heavenly Father to direct 
this work ; and with him are twelve 
apostles, also inspired of the Lord. 

I rejoice in the testimony I have, 
because I know this work is true. I 
was born of parents who were mem- 
bers of this Church, and I have been 
taught from my youth up to seek 
the Lord in prayer. I have received 
testimonies in praying to the Lord, 
evidences of the divinity of this 
work. I have received answer to 
prayer in accordance with the faith 
that I have exercised. I have been 



taught by my parents to be pure 
and virtuous, and I know that these 
same principles are inculcated in the 
hearts of all the Latter-day Saint 
boys and girls as they grow up, 
that they may remain true, and pure, 
and virtuous in the sight of God, 
and^ thereby continuing on may ob- 
tain salvation in the presence of our 
Father. 

I pray that His Spirit may attend 
us, that everyone who is present, if 
we are converted to the divinity of 
this work, may seek to live it from 
day to day, from hour to hour, from 
year to year, and endeavor to make 
our lives better from one day to 
another, from one year to another, 
that we may progress in the princi- 
ples of eternal life ; and if we are 
not yet convinced that this work is 
true, that we will do as has been 
asked of us by the Apostle Paul, 
"Prove all things, and hold fast 
to that which is good." Seek and 
investigate these principles ; if they 
are true, they are worth more than 
life itself. This religion is a living 
force in the world, and will con- 
tinue to be so. 

May the Lord bless and help us 
to be true to these principles, I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

BISHOP L0EENZ0 N. STOHL. 

(Of Third Ward, Brigham City.) 

I do not happen to be one of the 
fortunate ones whom Brother God- 
dard referred to as being accus- 
tomed to out-door speaking. My 
experience along that line has been 
very limited. I *pent a little more 
than three years in the mission field, 
and had the privilege only once of 
speaking to an out-door audience. 
But the result of that experience 
was very similar to that related by 



BISHOP LORENZO N. STOHL. 



121 



the brethren who have preceded me. 
Two Elders of our conference, who 
were choice men, clean, pure, vir- 
tuous, and faithful, and honest be- 
fore God and man, were selected to 
bear the message of the Redeemer 
to the people who resided in the 
City of Raleigh, North Carolina. 
They were counseled to travel with- 
out purse and without scrip, to de- 
liver that message without price, 
neither teaching for hire nor divin- 
ing for money; and because they 
traveled in this manner, as did the 
disciples of the Master, they were 
imprisoned by the city authorities, 
and finally driven from the city. 
Later, President Lyman and Apos- 
tle Cowley visited our conference, 
and they counseled that we try it 
again. This time it fell to the lot 
of a very good Elder and myself 
to undertake this mission, without 
purse, and without scrip. We did 
this, and called upon the same city 
authorities, whom we found very 
bitter and antagonistic toward us 
and the cause that we had the honor 
to represent. They advised us that 
not only the same treatment that 
was accorded our dear brethren 
would be given to us, but harsher 
methods would be resorted to unless 
we refrained from preaching the 
Gospel as we believed it, in the city 
of Raleigh. We reminded them of 
the fact that we were American citi- 
zens and intended to insist upon our 
rights as such. We desired to be- 
come conversant with the ordi- 
nances, which we did ; and we com- 
plied strictly with them — as Latter- 
day Saints are accustomed to doing 
— living the law of the land and 
of God. We went in fasting and 
prayer, and the Lord most wonder- 
fully opened up the way for us. As 
a result of the first meeting which 



we held, under adverse circum- 
stances and conditions, at the con- 
clusion of the meeting, we had in- 
vitations extended to us to share the 
hospitality of the good people, and 
to preach the Gospel, as we believed 
it, in some of the homes of the peo- 
ple. Without going into detail, and 
in order to make a long story short, 
it resulted, while I was there with 
my brethren, in the organization of 
a Sabbath School, and in the bap- 
tism of a number of heads of fam- 
ilies — I think more than a score. 
That was the condition I had the 
pleasure of leaving the city in, after 
the experiences that we had. It was 
simply the blessings of the Lord, we 
knew it, we saw how He opened up 
the way, and we gave to Him the 
honor and the praise. 

My brethren and sisters, and 
friends, I have very much enjoyed 
the testimonies of our dear brethren, 
and listening to the beautiful teach- 
ings that God has seen fit to impart 
to us through His servants, at the 
various sessions of this Conference. 
To me, so far as I have been priv- 
ileged to listen to them, it has been 
a veritable spiritual feast ; and I 
most earnestly hope and pray that it 
will give to us such a renewed de- 
termination to serve the Lord, in 
spirit and in truth, that we will 
manifest in our every day life that 
we love Him, and appreciate what 
He has done for us, by living more 
closely in harmony with His holy 
laws and requirements. 

I have been very highly pleased 
with the beautiful eulogies that I 
have listened to from my brethren, 
paid to our beloved Redeemer and 
His life's work and mission in the 
earth. Today, throughout all the 
Christian world, services are being

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



death and resurrection of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ. I do not 
recall the exact words of the 
Prophet Isaiah, but he testified to 
the fact that Jesus really took upon 
Himself our sins, the sins of the 
whole world ; that He hath borne 
our griefs and carried our sorrows ; 
that with our iniquities was He 
bruised, and with His stripes are we 
healed. I remember, as you do, the 
occasion in the Garden of Gethse- 
mane, when Judas Iscariot had ac- 
complished his ; work of betrayal 
of his Master, when the soldiers of 
the high priests surrounded the 
Lord and His disomies, and were 
about to lay hold upon Him. You 
remember, Peter drew his sword 
and smote off the ear of one of the 
high priests' servants, but Jesus 
chided him for this and said, 
"Knowest thou not that even now I 
can call down more than twelve le- 
gions of angels? But thus it must 
be that my Father's will might be 
fulfilled?" The whole thought and 
purpose was, "Father, not my will 
but Thy will be done." This act, 
this testimony of His, in connection 
with many others, and, in fact, all 
the incidents of His life and teach- 
ing, goes to demonstrate clearly 
that it was a voluntary act on His 
part. "Greater love hath no man 
than this, that he will lay down his 
life for his friend." Now Jesus 
not only did this, but more. He 
bore our cross, He carried our sor- 
rows, and took upon Himself our 
sins, as John testifies, "the sins of 
the whole world," and He suffered 
as no mortal man could suffer. I 
take it that the finite mind cannot 
even commence to comprehend the 
sufferings that He endured ; no 
wonder that He sweat great drops 
of blood. 



I glorify the name of Jesus 
Christ as my Redeemer. I praise 
Him, and feel to lo^e Him for what 
He has done for me and you, and 
for all the children of men, 
through His glorious atonement, 
whereby He gained the victory over 
the grave, with the result that we 
will all be resurrected from the 
tomb. Paul says that "as in Adam 
all die, even so in Christ shall all 
be made alive." I remember the 
words recorded by John the Revela- 
tor, in the twentieth chapter of Rev- 
elations — how he goes on to ex- 
plain about the resurrection of the 
just, that they are to live upon the 
earth, with their Redeemer, for a 
thousand years. At the expiration 
of that time, the general resurrec- 
tion shall take place — and he says, 
"I saw the dead, small and great, 
stand before God, and the books 
were opened, and another book was 
opened, which is the Book of Life, 
and the dead were judged out of 
those things which were written in 
the books, according to their 
works ; and death and hell delivered 
up the dead which were in them, 
and every man was judged accord- 
ing to his works." Therefore, we 
see how far-reaching is the effect 
of the atonement of our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ. 

The question that arises in my 
mind is whether or not our hearts 
are really in tune with our expres- 
sions in offering praise to Jesus, 
our Lord? Are we guilty, any of 
us, of worshiping Him with our 
mouths, doing Him nonor with 
our lips, and yet having our hearts 
far from Him? There have been 
people thus guilty, and it is pos- 
sible that some are in that frame 
of mind today. The point that I 
desired to make was this : there is 



BISHOP LORENZO N. STOHL.

no question as to the love of Jesus 
for us, but there is a question, per- 
haps, as to our true devotion and 
love for Him, and our apprecia- 
tion of what He has done for us. 
Now, the way we can manifest that 
love, the only way we can truly and 
fully manifest it is to live accord- 
ing to the laws and requirements 
which He, as the autnor of the plan 
of life and salvation, has laid 
down for our guidance. He says, 
"Not everyone that saith unto me, 
'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the 
Kingdom of Heaven, but he that 
doeth the will of my Father, which 
is in heaven." He says, many shall 
come to Him in that day and say 
they once prophesied in His name, 
in His name cast out devils, and 
done many other wonderful works, 
and then will He profess unto 
them, "I never knew you : depart 
from me, ye workers of iniquity." 
"Wherefore," says He, "Everyone 
who heareth these sayings of mine 
and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his 
house upon a rock, and the rain 
descended and the floods came, and 
the winds blew and beat upon that 
house, and it fell not, for it was 
founded upon a rock; but every- 
one who heareth these sayings of 
mine and doeth them not, shall be 
likened unto a foolish man, which 
built his house upon the sand, and 
the rain descended and the floods 
came and the wind blew and beat 
upon that house, and it fell, and 
great was the fall thereof." The 
people marveled at His teachings, 
for they said He taught them as one 
having authority, and not as the 
scribes, who were so imbued with 
the thought, and argument, and 
doctrine that all that was necessary 
was to confess God with our lips 



in order to be saved. He taught 
them a different doctrine. He 
taught them as one having author- 
ity, that if they were to enjoy the 
blessings which He, through His 
atonement, had placed within the 
reach of everyone of the sons and 
daughters of Adam, they must com- 
ply with the teachings which He 
had laid down for their guidance. 
"Though he were a son," says Paul, 
"yet learned He obedience by the 
things which He suffered, and be- 
ing made perfect, He became the 
author of eternal salvation to all 
them that obey them." He said, 
"Peter, lovest thou me? Then feed 
my lambs." On another occasion 
He. said, "If ye love me, ye will 
keep my commandments." John 
testifies that hereby we may know 
that we know Him, if we keep His 
commandments. ''But," says he, 
"He that saith he knoweth Him and 
keepeth not His commandments, 
is a liar and the truth is not in 
him." Now, then, this is the way 
in which we can manifest to God 
the Father, through Jesus Christ, 
His Son, our love and apprecia- 
tion of their love for us. He gave 
, His only Begotten Son that all who 
would believe on Him might be 
saved, providing they would believe 
with that faith which James, the 
apostle, characterizes as a living 
faith, an active faith, a faith that is 
not dead — because it is associated 
with works. He says, "Ye believe 
that there is one God. Ye do well. 
The devils also believe, and they 
tremble. But yet, know thou, O 
vain man, that faith without works 
is dead, even as the body withoutl 
the spirit is dead." 

I am proud to be able to say to 
you that the people of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 



i

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Saints believe in this living, active, 
vitalizing faith that will bring sal- 
vation in the presence of God. We 
believe in a practical religion, in do- 
ing as well as in saying things. I 
have a testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, that God lives, and that 
Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Re- 
deemer of the world. I have a tes- 
timony abiding in my heart, for 
which I am deeply grateful, that 
Joseph Smith was and is a prophet 
of the living God, and that all who 
will obey the teachings of the Gos- 
pel, will find it verily, as Paul tes- 
tified, "The power of God unto sal- 
vation." May this salvation be our 
lot, and that of all the honest in 
heart, is my earnest prayer for one 
and all in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

"Serenade," a violin solo, was 
rendered by Prof. Wm. C. Clive. 
The congregation sang the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter 'days ; 

We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Charles B. Felt.

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Easter significance — The Resurrection a 
matter of faith — Missionary work 
among the dead — The fathers and the 
children — "Mormonism" an up-to-date 
religion — Pre-eminently a Christian 
church . 

It is with feelings of genuine 
g'ratitude that I stand before you to 
add my testimony to those to 
which you have listened. A more 
inspiring sight than that before me 
could scarcely be imagined, and 
certainly could not be desired. It 
is doubtful if anywhere else in this 
great land a larger gathering 
graces this Easter day. I feel that 
the Latter-day Saints have mani- 
fested most praiseworthy interest in 
their religion, most commendable 
sincerity, and genuine devotion to 
the cause of truth in the attention 
they have given in this Confer- 
ence. 

This is indeed a day of days to 
all Christians. While it is true that 
the Easter celebration has its coun- 
terpart in many pagan customs, 
nevertheless Easter stands today 
for Christian belief, profession, and 
hope. It is the gladsome day of 
the year ; and we believe that in this 
present year the anniversary comes 
at very nearly the actual and cor- 
rect date. It is the anniversary of 
the greatest event in all history, the 
most effective miracle known to 
man — a miracle surpassing all that 
the mind of man could of itself 
conceive. It was upon the day we 
now commemorate that victory over 
the tomb was proclaimed and the 
glad tidings of eternal life were 
made known. 

The Latter-day Saints believe in 
a literal resurrection of the body. 
They accept the biblical doctrine 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



125 



in all its beauty and simplicity. 
They do not invest it with foreign 
mysteries, nor do they read into the 
sacred record interpretation and 
meaning not inherent therein. The 
Latter-day Saints believe that this 
life is a necessary part of the educa- 
tion of the soul, that it is a stage 
marking advancement and progres- 
sion; that only those of the sons 
and daughters of God who were 
worthy were permitted to take 
upon themselves mortal taberna- 
cles upon the earth. They believe 
that death is just as much a part of 
the divine plan as is birth ; and that 
death is but a passing from one 
necessary stage to another yet more 
advanced. They believe, without 
question or doubt, that the body 
and the spirit shall again be united 
in a literal resurrection ; and be it 
remembered, the resurrection of the 
body is the controlling thought and 
the central idea of Easter service. 
The man who believes in the resur- 
rection of the body must base his 
belief upon revelation ; and the man 
who so believes is inconsistent if 
he questions the truth declared in 
absolute and literal revelation from 
God. 

It is a fact that we look around 
in nature vainly for any analogy 
of the resurrection. I have never 
been in harmony with the attempts 
of some to find analogies in nature 
where they do not exist relating to 
this great event of such surpassing 
importance. The egg, which is ex- 
hibited as the Easter symbol, has 
been pointed to as an instance of life 
after death. It has been said that 
the coming forth of the bird from 
the tomb-like recess of the egg is an 
instance of the return of life from 
death. The analogy is faulty; the 
example is not good; for be it 



understood that the egg that can 
hatch or may hatch is not dead ; and 
if it be truly dead, it does not again 
come to life. The bursting forth 
of the buds in the spring time, the 
putting on of their foliage again 
by the trees, has been strained by 
some and pressed into service as 
another instance of a resurrection 
from the dead ; but I believe that 
this is equally faulty, for the tree 
that is dead does not put forth 
leaves in the spring, and the plant 
that is dead does not again bear 
blossoms. The sleep of the insect 
by which it passes from the crawl- 
ing larva into the death-like, corpse- 
like chrysalis, from which, after a 
time, the winged imago comes forth 
in all the glory of maturity, has 
been used by others as an instance 
of the resurrection. But, again, 
this is faulty and untrue, for the 
chrysalis is not dead and if it were 
it would not burst forth into the 
winged beauty that crowns the se- 
quence of insect life. When we 
accept these natural occurrences as 
analogies of the bodily resurrection 
from death, we are lead to regard 
favorably also that analogy which 
some attempt to affirm, that the 
crucified Christ was not dead, but 
that He was in a state of coma, or 
trance, and came out from that con- 
dition by a simple process of re- 
vivification, and was seen again of 
men, not as an immortal Being but 
as a man who had been revived 
from a faint. Jesus died upon the 
cross. His spirit was literally and 
actually separated from His body; 
that body was not in a state 
of suspended animation, while still 
alive, that body was dead in the 
sense of being an untenanted taber- 
nacle of clay, and it was only by 
the power of God that it could be 



126

again brought to life. Let us not 
deny the literalness of the resur- 
rection as made known through the 
revelations of God. We believe 
that we shall in very truth die, and 
that the spirit — that immortal part 
of man, which existed before the 
body was framed, and which shall 
exist and continue to live after that 
body has gone to decay, that spirit 
shall take upon itself again this 
tabernacle of earthly element, im- 
mortalized, however, and destined 
to serve it as a fit garment through 
all eternity. 

The Latter-day Saints have been 
charged with great literalness, with 
astounding simplicity, and as one 
critic put it to me, with a brutal 
materiality, in their doctrine. We 
acknowledge the charge in the sense 
in which it was meant, although we 
may object to some of the adjec- 
tives. The Latter-day Saints are 
just so simple-minded that they are 
willing to believe the Lord when He 
speaks, and take Him at His word. 
We rejoice in the hope and the as- 
surance of a glorious resurrection. 
We rejoice in the work that was in- 
augurated at that first Easter pe- 
riod, for and in behalf of the dead. 
For while the body of the Christ 
lay in the tomb, as we learn beyond 
question, His spirit went to the 
spirits in prison, to those who were 
held in bonds because of their dis- 
obedience, to those who had not 
been privileged to learn of the re- 
deeming efficacy of the Gospel ; and 
He introduced and inaugurated 
there a missionary labor that has 
been going on ever since — a mis- 
sionary work compared with which 
that which we attempt to do here 
upon earth, with our two thousand 
missionaries out in the field, is not 
even as a drop compared to the 



ocean. Men are needed for mission- 
ary service among the dead. Who 
are the dead but those who once 
have lived? God is Lord of both the 
living and the dead ; and all live 
unto Him. If it be true that the 
man who is now living cannot hope 
to enter into the Kingdom of God 
unless he complies with the simple 
law and requirement laid down 
by the author of our salvation, 
namely, that we must be born of 
water and of the spirit, that applies 
equally to each and every one of 
the uncounted myriads who have 
lived and passed beyond. 

The doctrine of salvation for the 
dead came as a revelation to the 
earth. It had to be made known 
anew; for while it had been' known 
of old, it, like many other of the 
saving doctrines of the Gospel, had 
been lost sight of and forgotten. 
The labor in behalf of the dead was 
cited by Paul, an apostle of old, 
as an argument and evidence of the 
resurrection ; said he : "Else what 
shall they do which are baptized for 
the dead, if the dead rise not at 
all? Why are they then baptized 
for the dead?" Throughout the 
centuries of the deep night of the 
apostasy, not a single ordinance was 
performed in behalf of the dead. 
Yet, the ranks of the dead at that 
time were increasing by uncounted 
thousands. We are greatly behind 
in the work, but the Lord has pro- 
vided a means by which it shall be 
done, and by which it is the priv- 
ilege of those who come in at the 
door themselves to hold that door 
open to admit others, others who 
were once among the living and are 
now among the dead. 

To me there is special significance 
in our assembling upon this block, 
by the great temple that is conse- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



127 



crated mostly to the work for the 
dead. For be it known that this 
great , labor of temple-building, for 
which the Latter-day Saints are so 
well known and so widely famed, 
is very largely, though not entire- 
ly, a work in behalf of the dead. 
They are not giving of their sub- 
stance to erect these great buildings 
for themselves, for aggrandizement, 
nor for the beautification of earth. 
The temple-building spirit manifest- 
ed among the Latter-day Saints is 
the spirit of absolute unselfishness ; 
it is the spirit of Elijah, the spirit 
by which the feelings of the children 
are turned toward the fathers, and 
the feelings of the fathers are di- 
rected toward the children; for no 
man stands upon this earth alone. 
We talk of independence. No man 
is independent. We are all inter- 
dependent ; and we shall only rise 
as we carry others with us, and 
as we are assisted by others. My 
own mind is led to that great sub- 
ject, and I have thought .of it much 
as I have sat through the exercises 
of the morning, because of the fact 
that it was at the glorious Easter 
time the work for the dead was in- 
augurated ; it was at this season 
the great missionary labor in the 
spirit world was begun, and the 
doors were there opened and a 
means of deliverance preached unto 
those who had been sitting in dark- 
ness, some of them even from the 
days of Noah. 

I feel particularly gratified in this 
opportunity of bearing to you a 
humble testimony of the divinity of 
this work, of the sacredness of the 
labor for which the Church stands. 
As we heard yesterday, testimony 
is ofttimes more effective than ar- 
gument, ofttimes more potent than 
reasons, as man counts reasons, and 



lists them and collates them, and 
analyzes them ; for, after, all he can 
only base the correctness of his re- 
sults upon the assurance that his 
processes are free from error. 
Whereas, one who is able to stand 
forth and say "I know," testifies 
of himself, because of the knowl- 
edge that is within him ; and that 
knowledge is given him of God. 
This people believe in testimony- 
making, in testimony-bearing, in 
testimony-speaking; and while they 
do not believe that the testimony 
of one man shall of itself convict 
or condemn another, they do believe 
that a man's humble, sincere testi- 
mony is entitled to respectful con- 
sideration. The Latter-day Saints 
tell you that they know that the 
Gospel is true, for that knowledge 
has been given unto them ; and 
when a man is able to say, as said 
the chief of the apostles of old of 
the Christ, "Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God," to him 
does the answer apply, "Flesh and 
blood hath not revealed this unto 
thee, but the Father who is in 
heaven." And, let that testimony 
come in what way it will, it has a 
saving power for man ; this is the 
kind of testimony that abides and 
abounds in the hearts of this people, 
and they manifest it in their lives. 
Jesus came with His testimony, and 
the people were astounded at His 
doctrines, not because He brought 
them something that was essentially 
new in all particulars ; for He used 
their scriptures ; He brought into 
service their proverbs, and referred 
to the things which they well knew ; 
but He gave to all of this a new 
application and a new meaning ; and 
they said: "He speaks as one hav- 
ing authority, and not as the 
scribes." His discourse was no 



A 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



labored compilation of passages. 
He did not base His doctrines upon 
what the prophets who had gone 
ahead of Him had said, though He 
referred approvingly to many of 
their inspired utterances ; but He 
spoke from the knowledge He had 
within Him, and He spoke by reason 
of the authority that He held ; and 
thus was He distinguished among 
the teachers of the day, and there- 
fore did He compel attention. 

Such, in a measure is the testi- 
mony of the Latter-day Saint Elder. 
He goes forth in humility. He may, 
perhaps, not be eloquent. He may 
be far from learned, as the world 
reckons learning; yet he is not ig- 
norant, when he is able to stand 
forth and say, "I know that this 
Gospel is true." We look upon the 
scriptures of the past with rever- 
ence. We believe that they are nec- 
essary to the building up of the 
church in this day; but we do not 
depend upon them for our author- 
ity, nor for the interpretation we 
place upon the messages from God. 

We do not believe in living whol- 
ly in the past. We believe in an up- 
to-date doctrine, in an up-to-date 
church, an up-to-date religion, a re- 
ligion that is ever enriched by new 
revelation, a church that is in direct 
communication with headquarters, a 
church that is receiving through 
revelation the word of God today, 
pertaining to the affairs of today. 
When the proclamation was first 
made, that direct revelation from 
God was a feature of modern times, 
there was consternation in the ranks 
of the churches of the day; for be 
it known that when this church was 
established in the nineteenth century, 
there was not on earth a church 
sacred to the name of Christ. There 
were churches in great variety, 



churches that bore the names of 
men, organizations as well as build- 
ings established and erected to the 
name of Peter, and Paul, and Mo- 
ses, and Elias, churches named after 
peculiarities of their worship, Pres- 
byterian, Congregational, Episco- 
palian ; churches named after men 
who had devoted themselves to their 
establishment — there were the Lu- 
theran church, the Wesleyan 
church, the Calvinist church. But 
when it was proclaimed that there 
was now upon the earth a church 
sacred to the name of Christ there 
was fear and trembling manifest 
among the professors of religion. 
Consternation entered their souls 
when that banner was raised ; and 
yet,what other name is appropriate ? 
The profession of this church is set 
forth in its name. It is not the 
church of Joseph Smith, nor of 
Brigham Young, nor of Joseph F. 
Smith, nor of any other man or 
combination of men. It is not the 
Mormon church, though we do not 
object to that term which was first 
applied in derision, except for the 
possible error that may accompany 
its use ; for it is not the church of 
Mormon ! it is the Church of Jesus 
Christ. If the name, the Church of 
Jesus Christ, has been assumed au- 
thoritatively, it is of itself ample 
explanation of the phenomenal rise 
and development of this church; 
and if it has been assumed with- 
out authority, it is the most glaring 
instance of blasphemy the world has 
known. No greater challenge can 
be given to the world than the name 
borne by this church. I testify to 
you that this is the Church of Jesus 
Christ, that the power of the Christ 
is in it, the very Christ that lived 
as a man, that died as a God, the 
one who was ressurrected, who 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



129 



came forth from the tomb with the 
very body that had been pierced and 
laid there ; that He has again spok- 
en in this day and age of the 
world, even as had been declared 
He would speak, that He has again 
established His saving Gospel 
among men, and has opened the 
way by which men may attain sal- 
vation and eternal life in His pres- 
ence and in that of the Father, the 
only way under heaven by which 
salvation and exaltation may be at- 
tained, the only name under heaven 
by which man may be saved. 

Strange, is it not, that some have 
said, in their ignorance, that this 
Mormon Church is not a Christian 
church. Not Christian when it bears 
by authority the name of Christ, 
who is the author of all that is 
best in Christianity ? Not Christian 
— when its great mission is the pre- 
paring of the earth for the coming 
of its King, that same Lord, Jesus 
Christ? Not Christian — when it is 
setting before the world an example 
of self-sacrifice never before known, 
and all in the interest of Christ 
and His work? The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is preaching the same doctrine that 
was preached in the church of old, 
and is proclaiming- the same great 
message, Repent, repent ; for the 
kingdom of heaven is at hand. We 
say that Christ will return to the 
earth, and literally reign here in 
Person, that it is His right to reign ; 
and that the church is preparing 
for His coming. The testimonies 
to which we have listened, the testi- 
monies to which we do listen in 
smaller gatherings than this, in the 
various stakes and wards in the 
Church, all have the same sound, 
the same truth and divinity of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and the di- 



vinity of the work of the man who 
was the instrument, in the hands of 
God, in establishing this Church on 
the earth in the dispensation of the 
fullness of times ; for this is that 
dispensation, to which the prophets 
of old have been looking, for which 
they have yearned, toward which 
their desires have gone forth. It is 
the dispensation of fullness, it 
marks the ushering in of the great 
finale of this drama of the Lord. 
Right thankful should we be that 
we are privileged to have a name 
and standing in the Church in this 
day and to take part in this great 
work. I am thankful for that name 
and for that standing, and for the 
privilege of testifying to you today, 
as the last and the least of those 
who have been called to stand be- 
fore the world at the present time 
as the special witnesses of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, who verily lives and 
who verily shall come as hath been 
predicted, to take His place upon the 
earth, amongst His people. May 
His spirit ever guide us, through all 
the scenes of life, to make us wor- 
thy of our name, worthy of our 
promised destiny, I ask, in His 
name, Amen.

"The angel said that my name

fell from the lips of a young boy, 
a little over three-quarters of a cen- 
tury ago, in the northern portion of 
the State of New York ; and they 
brought a sneer and a laugh from

those who heard of the words. At 
that time this western civilization 
was unknown. I see before me to- 
day a sea of faces of individuals who, 
I doubt very much, could have been 
gathered together in these valleys 
of the Rocky Mountains had it not 
been for the message that that 
young man had to deliver to the 
world. No doubt, there are many 
nations represented here before me 
today, people whose fathers and 
mothers prayed for many years, be- 
fore they gathered to this land, that 
God would open the way that they 
might say successfully, "Come let 
us go up to the mountain of the 
Lord, to the house of the God of 
Jacob, where we can learn more of 
His ways and walk in His paths." 

Seven hundred years before the 
birth of Christ, God had a prophet 
upon this earth to whom He opened 
a vision of the future, and He saw 
the valleys of the Rocky Mountains. 
He saw the time when the mountain 
of the house of God would be estab- 
lished in the tops of these mount- 
ains, and that house would be the 
inspiration that would gather people 
from .all nations under the sun. 
When that dispensation was opened, 
through the visions given and 
through the inspiration bestowed 
upon the young man, in the State 
of New York, it was the beginning 
of the restoration of all things spo- 
ken of by all the holy prophets since 
the world began. 

During the sessions of this con- 
ference, the inspiration of the dif- 
ferent speakers has been to bear 
testimony to the divine mission of 
the prophet Joseph Smith, and the 
great missionary work that is going 
on throughout the length and 
breadth of this earth. The scene 
before us strengthens the testimony 



of President Smith, as he gave it 
to us at the opening of this con- 
ference, concerning the increased 
strength of this work, arid the fal- 
sity of the accusation made by ene- 
mies that Mormonism was in a 
weakened condition or on the wane. 
There is no weakening manifest 
when a body of people as numerical- 
ly small as the Latter-day Saints, 
through the faith they have in the 
everlasting Gospel, and in the divine 
mission of the prophet Joseph 
Smith, maintain in the nations of 
the earth, at their own expense — 
I mean the expense borne by the 
fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, 
and 'wives of the missionaries them- 
selves — an army of missionaries two 
thousand strong, and are not afraid 
to send them out among all the 
churches of the world, with no fear 
that they may possibly find a reli- 
gion more true than that which God 
Almighty has given to our fathers 
and to us. 

All kinds of weapons have been 
used against this Church, but God 
has so arranged matters that every 
attack, every such weapon has and 
will contribute to the advancement 
instead of the destruction of this 
work. It cannot be destroyed. Its 
mission is to fill this earth with the 
righteousness of God, to bring about 
the celestialization of the earth it- 
self, and to save mankind in the 
Celestial kingdom of God. From 
the day of its organization, taking 
all of the revelations that God Al- 
mighty gave to the boy prophet, 
from that day until now it has been 
unlike the other churches of the 
world, it has never seen the neces- 
sity of revising its creed. Among 
those who have made attacks 
against this work, of recent days, 
are men who are looked upon as 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



131 



among the most eloquent and deeply- 
learned of men, as well as weapons 
used in the hands of the most ignor- 
ant. Not long ago, a very eloquent, 
learned bishop of the Episcopal 
church, in speaking before an au- 
dience in New York City, by way 
of easing the fear of the people that 
"Mormonism" would amount to 
something, and as an argument that 
it would not, stated that there was 
not a scholar among the Latter-day 
Saints. (I believe that he did give 
Elder B. H*. Roberts the credit of 
knowing a little bit ; but he said that 
very easy indeed.) I don't know 
what that individual would have 
done, or would have said, if he had 
lived when Christ Himself dwelt in 
mortality, and as He went along His 
way saw the illiterate fishermen 
drawing in their nets and had wit- 
nessed the Master call His ministry, 
saying to Peter "Come, I will make, 
you a fisher after men." If the 
good bishop is here today, I would 
not have him think for a moment 
that I say this by way of a reflection 
upon his great wisdom. I only make 
mention of it that he might per- 
ceive how little Christ knew about 
how to call men to the ministry. 
The Almighty has always taken the 
simple things of the earth to con- 
found the wisdom of the mighty. 
The principal education He requires 
is the education of humility, of 
meekness, of faith, and of purity, 
with these qualifications wisdom 
will follow. These are the materials 
the Almighty can handle. And 
some of these ministers who are 
so much concerned about this thing, 
how much better would be their 
position, if they are really anxious 
for the salvation of our souls, if 
they would ask for the privilege 
of occupying this pulpit, and from 



the word of God try to show the 
Latter-day Saints that faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ is an obnoxious 
doctrine, that repentance from sin 
is not true, that baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins is not 
a doctrine of Christ, that the gift 
of the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands was not taught by the 
ancients ; these are principles ,of 
Mormonism. You do not hear from 
their lips arguments against our 
faith, but tirades of abuse against 
our good, humble, and great leader, 
and others who have been leaders 
in this Church. 

Brother Talmage quoted the 
words of Christ to Peter, "Whom 
do men say that I am?" And after 
Peter had named the different char- 
acters who had lived upon the earth 
whom men said that He might pos- 
sibly be, and when Christ had asked 
him directly "whom sayest thou that 
I am?" which brought forth the 
answer, "Thou art Christ, the Son 
of the living God," then said Jesus, 
"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; 
flesh and blood hath not revealed 
this unto you, but my Father which 
is in heaven; and I say unto thee, 
that thou art Peter, and upon this 
rock" — this knowledge that came to 
Peter that Jesus was the Christ, 
the means whereby He received 
this information — "upon this rock 
will I build my church, and the 
gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it." The Catholic world 
says that it was built upon Peter; 
the "Mormon" Church says it was 
built upon that principle that con- 
veyed to Peter the knowledge, the 
truth that Jesus was the Christ. 
This Church is built upon that 
foundation of revelation from God, 
and we have the promise from our 
Father that it shall stand forever, 



132

nevermore to be thrown down or 
given to another people. I tell you 
that it cannot be broken to pieces. 

The difference between this and 
all other faiths is that one man in 
this Church has just as much right 
to know that God lives, to know 
that Jesus is the Christ, to know 
thaj: Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God, as any other man. It is 
built upon that testimony; and that 
is the reason we are so strong. To 
the stranger who may be present, 
I will say that if this question should 
be placed to this congregation, How 
many know for themselves, just as 
well as the President of the Church 
here knows, that Juseph Smith was 
a prophet of God, — oh what a tes- 
timony would be presented to that 
stranger ; at least nine-tenths of the 
congregation would respond that 
God Almighty had revealed to them 
the truthfulness of this Gospel, and 
that they do not rest upon the tes- 
timony of any other. That is where 
my testimony is planted. I know 
for myself that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God. I know that this 
is not the work of man. I know 
that we are living in the dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times, when 
God has promised that a people 
shall be prepared for the reception 
of His Son, when He comes to the 
earth to reign in glory. This is 
my testimony in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM G. THACHER. 

(Late President of Holland Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is cer- 
tainly a pleasure to me to have this 
privilege of bearing my testimony 
to so many Latter-day Saints. I 
trust, the short time I stand before 
you, that I may be dictated by the 



Spirit of God. I desire your faith 
and prayers that I may say nothing 
contrary to the doctrines of Christ. 
I realize and sense fully the words 
of the Apostle Paul when he said, 
"Though we, or an angel from 
heaven, preach any other Gospel 
unto you, than that which we have 
preached unto you, let him be ac- 
cursed." 

I have been very much instructed 
by the remarks of those who have 
spoken today. I have been built, 
up in my faith in the Gospel of 
Christ. I know that this is the 
Church of Christ. I realize that 
Jesus came upon the earth, that He 
lived, and that He preached re- 
pentance unto the children of men. 

Today, hundreds of thousands ot 
Christians are celebrating the an- 
niversary of His resurrection from 
the dead, but many thousands of 
£hem do not believe in a literal 
resurrection of mankind. Though 
they are celebrating His resurrec- 
tion, yet they do not understand 
that mankind will be raised from 
the dead with bodies of flesh and 
bones. Christ told us that He was 
an example for us in all things ; 
and while these professed Christians 
claim to believe in Jesus Christ, yet 
they deny that mankind will again 
stand upon the earth, in bodies of 
flesh and bones as tangible as that 
which we now possess. "If the 
dead rise not all, then why are ye 
baptized for the dead," said the 
Apostle Paul. You know that the 
tenor and burden of testimony of 
the apostles of old, after the death 
of Christ, was that He was raised 
from the dead ; that, after He had 
preached to the spirits in prison. 
His spirit and body were again re- 
united, and He appeared unto Mary 
and unto the apostles, also that He 



ELDER BRIG HAM G. THATCHER. 



133 



appeared unto a multitude of others, 
and taught the disciples that they 
should go among the nations of 
the world and preach repentance, 
and belief in God and in the Son 
of God, Jesus Christ. 

We, as Latter-day Saints, have 
been gathered out from the four 
quarters of the world. We have 
accepted the message that Jesus 
Christ has again spoken from the 
heavens, that the Gospel is restored, 
and again the authority of the holy 
Priesthood is bestowed upon man- 
kind. This authority is here in our 
midst. We have come here, gath- 
ered from the nations of the world, 
and now I ask you, my brethren 
and sisters, is it worth while liv- 
ing in accordance with this Gos- 
pel, this Gospel which is said to be 
the power of God unto salvation? 
Now that we have been baptized, 
now that we have received the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, is it worth 
while keeping the commandments 
of God? Too many of our young 
men and young women, and even 
some older ones, are becoming in- 
different to this Gospel message. 
I have been told that at meetings 
held in one of the eastern cities, 
against this people, erstwhile mem- 
bers of this Church are attending 
those meetings every Sunday eve- 
ning. They have become cold to 
the Gospel, and are seeking the 
bread of life from a place where 
no such bread can be had. Oh, 
my brethren and sisters, I would 
that I had the voice of an angel 
to cry unto you the necessity of 
living the Gospel according to the 
doctrines therein taught unto us. 
This Gospel is the power of God 
unto salvation, if we will live it. 
It is given to help us to reach the 
celestial kingdom of God. Shall we 



throw away this means of salvation, 
and fall short of that high place 
which God in His tender mercy 
has provided for us if we will obey 
His commandments ? I tell you that 
the reason some of our young men 
and young women are indifferent 
to the Gospel is because they have 
not obtained a knowledge of it. 
Fathers and mothers, teach your 
young people in your homes, teach 
them to acquire a knowledge of the 
Gospel, teach them that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, that Joseph F. 
Smith is a prophet of God, and 
that the Apostles and those who are 
in authority in the Church are men 
of God, holding the keys of this 
dispensation. If you will instill 
knowledge into their hearts, while 
they are young, they will not go 
astray as they grow up. 

The Gospel in the Netherlands 
is progressing. There are many 
thousands of honest souls in that 
land ; and while there is much 
prejudice among that people, be- 
cause of the slanders traducing the 
chraracter of this people, it is dif- 
ficult to bring a knowledge of the 
Gospel to them. Yet they are 
generally charitable, and will lis- 
ten unto you. I tell you, my 
brethren and sisters, that there is 
a great future for that mission. 
There are thousands, perhaps hun- 
dreds of thousands there who will 
yet receive the Gospel. Never have 
I found a people in any land or 
nation, or among any people, ap- 
parently so well prepared to receive 
the Gospel as Hollanders are, or 
so willing to listen to the message 
of repentance and salvation. I want 
to say to these fathers and mothers 
who have sons in that mission, that 
there is no better place on the earth 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



where they can labor. Every op- 
portunity is given to them to de- 
velop in a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel, and to work and progress in 
ability to proclaim it. I say unto 
you that there are many who will 
be raised up to befriend your sons 
who are doing missionary work 
there. Encourage your boys to 
work energetically, and they will 
see fruits of their labors. The 
present president of that mission, 
Bishop Eardley, is a man of God, 
and he is a man with whom you 
can trust your young men. I look 
for the work in that land to grow 
even faster than it nas grown in the 
past. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
well in the Gospel. I know that 
Jesus is the Christ. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, 
and I know that Joseph F. Smith 
also is a prophet of God. I have 
known him, I have seen his work, 
and I know whereof I speak. I 
know that these men who are called 
to be Apostles, and Seventies, and 
High Priests, in this work, are 
men of God, and that they will lead 
you in truth and righteousness into 
the celestial kingdom of God, if 
you will give heed to their counsel. 

I pray God to bless you and bless 
this work, that it may grow, and 
that the day may speedily come 
when rigteousness will reign su- 
preme upon the earth ; and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Later generations in the Church as 
faithful as the first — Jesus Christ the 
type and evidence of the resurrection 
— Obscure passage of Scripture ex- 
plained — Individual identity retained 



throughout eternity — God's blessings 
invoked upon Priesthood and people. 

I say, in all candor, that I am 
sorry we can not have another day 
or two in which to continue our 
Conference, but it would not be 
wisdom to do so, under all the cir- 
cumstances. There are many of 
our brethren whom you would de- 
light to hear, and who are indeed 
a tower of strength in testimony 
and knowledge of the principles of 
the Gospel, who would be delighted 
to address you, if opportunity would 
permit. Our brethren of the presid- 
ing Seventy, will be deprived of the 
opportunity during this Conference 
of speaking to you, which I regret 
quite as much as you or they do, and 
I am sure you all regret not to 
have the privilege of hearing them ; 
but I cannot see how the time could 
have been more wisely, or earnest- 
ly, more intelligently, or profitably, 
spent than it has been. 

We have had testimonies here 
from those who mark the third gen- 
eration of Latter-day Saints, anc^ 
I am satisfied that there is no one 
other, perhaps, than the Prophet 
Joseph Smith himself who could 
have borne more powerful testi- 
monies of the truth or could have 
told the truth more clearly, plain- 
ly and forcibly than it has been 
told by these young men who are 
of the third or fourth generation 
of Latter-day Saints. I want to say 
to you that there are thousands of 
young men in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints of the 
third and fourth generation of mem- 
bers of the Church who can bear 
to you, as firmly and as strongly, 
their testimony of the divinity of 
this work, the divinity of the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and of the mission of the Son of 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

God, as any of their fathers or 
fore- fathers could have done. 

When men predict evil concern- 
ing the children of Zion, they be- 
come false witnesses before God. 
It may be true that many of the 
children of the Latter-day Saints 
will lack understanding, will fail 
to improve their minds and their 
opportunities. It is not at all un- 
likely that many of the children, 
whose parents have neglected to 
teach them in their childhood, will 
grow up in a measure indifferent 
to the work of God, but those who 
are taught the truth will receive 
it and will abide in it ; and there will 
be sufficient numbers of these to 
carry on the work of God, to leaven 
the whole lump; that the leaven 
of the Gospel shall be carried, as 
it is being carried today, to the 
uttermost bounds of the earth, and 
every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people, will yet have the privilege 
of hearing the Gospel from the 
mouths and from the inspired tes- 
timonies of the third, fourth, fifth 
and sixth generations, of the chil- 
dren of this people. It is the duty 
of Latter-day Saints to teach their 
children the truth, to bring them 
up in the way they should go, to 
teach them the first principles of 
the Gospel, the necessity of bap- 
tism for the remission of sins, and 
for membership in the Church of 
Christ, teaching them the necessity 
of receiving the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by the laying on of hands, 
which will lead them into all truth, 
and which will reveal to them 
things that have passed and things 
which are to come, and show to 
them more clearly those things 
which are present with them, that 
they may comprehend the truth, and 
that they may walk in the light as 



Christ is in the light; that they 
may have fellowship with Him, and 
that His blood may cleanse them 
from all sin. 

Speaking of the resurrection, the 
subject on which so much has been 
said during this Conference, and ap- 
propriately said, too — we distinctly 
believe that Jesus Christ Himself 
is the true, and only true type of the 
resurrection of men from death 
unto life. We believe there is no 
other form of resurrection from 
death to life; that as He rose, and 
as He preserved His identity, even 
to the scars of the wounds in His 
hands and feet and side, that He 
could prove Himself to those that 
were skeptical of the possibility 
of rising from the dead, that He 
was indeed Himself, the Lord cruci- 
fied, buried in the tomb, and raised 
again from death to life. So it 
will be with you and with every 
son and daughter of Adam, born 
into the world. You will not lose 
your identity any more than Christ 
did. You will be brought forth 
from death to life again, just as 
sure as Christ was brought forth 
from death to life again, just as 
surely as those who ministered to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith had 
been raised from death to life — 
therefore, in the same manner in 
which Christ has been raised, so 
will life, and the resurrection from 
death to life again, come upon all 
who have descended from our first 
parents. The death that came into 
the world by Adam's transgression 
has been conquered, and its terror 
vanquished by the power and 
righteousness of the Son of God. 
He came to redeem man from the 
temporal death, and also to save 
him from spiritual death if he will 
repent of his sins, and will be-

lieve on the name of Christ, follow 
His example, and obey His laws. 
You may read it in the greatest 
plainness in the Book of Mormon, 
in the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, as well as in the New Tes- 
timent, and in the predictions of 
the ancient prophets concerning the 
coming of the Son of God and His 
resurrection from death to life. Paul 
used the argument that has been re- 
cited here a number of times : "Else 
what shall they do which are bap- 
tized for the dead, if the dead rise 
not at all ? Why are they then bap- 
tized for the dead?" 

Why did Jesus teach the doctrine 
that there was no marrying, nor 
giving in marriage in the other 
world ? Why did He teach the doc- 
trine that marriage was instituted 
by the Father and designed to be 
accomplished in this life? Why 
did He rebuke those who sought 
to entrap Him when they brought 
to Him the example of the fulfill- 
ment of the law of Moses, for 
Moses wrote the law that God gave 
him, that if a man married in 
Israel and died without issue, it was 
the duty of his brother to take his 
widows and raise up seed unto his 
brother; and when seven of these 
brothers — ( which is doubtless a 
problem that these men put to the 
Savior in order to entrap Him if 
they could) — had taken her, to 
whom should she belong in the 
resurrection, since they all had her? 
Jesus declared to them, "Ye do 
err, not knowing the Scriptures, 
nor the power of God." They did 
not understand the principle of seal- 
ing for time and for all eternity ; 
that what God hath joined together 
neither man nor death can put 
asunder." (Matt. 19:6); they had 
wandered from that principle. It 



had fallen into disuse among them ; 
they had ceased to understand it ; 
and consequently they did not com- 
prehend the truth ; but Christ did. 
She could only be the wife in eter- 
nity of the man to whom she was 
united by the power of God for 
eternity, as well as for time ; and 
Christ understood the principle but 
He did not cast His pearls before 
the swine that tempted Him. 

Why has the Lord revealed to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, in this 
dispensation, that great and glorious 
principle of baptism for the dead, 
the principle of turning the hearts 
of the children to the fathers, and 
of the hearts of the fathers to the 
children; that the fathers could not 
be made perfect without the chil- 
dren ; that the children could not 
obtain a fulness of happiness and 
joy, nor become perfect, without 
the fathers? Why did He teach 
us the principle of eternal union 
of man and wife? Because God 
knew that we were His children 
here, to remain His children for- 
ever and ever, and that we were 
just as truly individuals, and that 
our individuality was as identical 
as that of the Son of God, and 
would therefore continue so worlds 
without end. So that the man 
receiving his wife by the power of 
God, for time and for all eternity, 
would have the right to claim her 
and she to claim her husband, in 
the world to come. Neither would 
be changed, except from mortality 
to immortality, neither would be 
other than himself or herself ; but 
they will have their identity in the 
world to come, precisely as they 
exercise their individuality and en- 
joy their identity here. God has 
revealed this principle, and it has 
its bearing upon the evidence that 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



137 



we possess of the actual, literal 
resurrection of the body, just as it 
is and as the prophets have declared 
it in the Book of Mormon. Now, 
that is the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints, and that is the doctrine 
of this Church, as taught in the 
Book of Mormon, Doctrine and 
Covenants, the Bible and the Pearl 
of Great Price ; and we are willing 
to stand by it ; and our children, and 
our children's children after us 
to the latest generation, will abide 
in this truth, for it is founded on 
revelation from God. 

Now, this is my testimony, and I 
know, just as my brethren know 
and have said, not any better than 
they do — for some of my brethren 
who have spoken here have told my 
own faith and my own testimony, 
and my own conviction, better than 
I could do it myself; for they have 
had the language and power of ex- 
pression, to convey the truth better 
than I ever could have done it my- 
self, and I believe their testimony — 
I know they have told the truth. 
The Spirit of God bears record of 
it in my heart. And when I hear 
my brethren teach these things, 
when I hear them bear testimony 
of the truth, it melts my soul, and I 
glorify my Father in heaven for the 
truth he has put into the hearts of 
my fellow-servants and co-laborers, 
in this great and glorious cause of 
human redemption in which we are 
so earnestly engaged. 

Let me conclude by saying to you 
what I have said many times, and 
what I hope I will ever stand by. 
I would a thousand times rather 
go to my grave as I am, with the 
convictions that I possess, than to 
falter for one instant in that which 
God has revealed to me. It is more 
than mortal life to me. My stand- 



ing in the Church is worth to me 
more than this life — ten thousand 
thousand times. For in this I have 
life everlasting. In this I have the 
glorious promise of the associations 
of my loved ones throughout all 
eternity. In obedience to this work, 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, I 
shall gather around me my family, 
my children, my children's children 
until they become as numerous as 
the seed of Abraham, or as count- 
less as the sands upon the sea 
shore. For this is my right and 
privilege, and the right and priv- 
ilege of every member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints who holds the Priest- 
hood and will magnify it in the sight 
of God. Without it there is death 
and desolation — disintegration and 
disinheritance ; without it there may 
be a chance to become a ministering 
spirit, a servant unto servants 
throughout the endless ages ; but 
in this Gospel there is a chance to 
become a Son of God, in the image 
and likeness of the Father and of 
His only Begotten Son in the flesh. 
I would rather take my boys and 
my girls to the grave, while they 
are innocent, than to see them en- 
trapped in the wickedness, the un- 
belief, and the spirit of apostasy so 
prevalent in the world, and be led 
away from the Gospel of salvation. 

I have lived here some seventy 
odd years, and I have had a pur- 
pose in life, and I have been stead- 
ily plodding on toward the accom- 
plishment of that purpose. I have 
not been able to do any great thing. 
I do not feel capable of doing any 
great thing. Whenever, if ever, 
I say a word that is acceptable to 
God, whenever I speak His truth, 
it is by the presence and influence 
of His Spirit, and it is to His honor 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and to His glory that I do it. I 
never have taken any honor unto 
myself. I want no honor; I claim 
none except that of being a member 
of the Church of Christ, the honor 
of having a standing unsullied, un- 
dented, unshaken, and immovable, 
in the kingdom of my God and His 
Christ. That is all I want; and I 
mean to have it, by the help of God. 
I have gone too far on this road 
to turn back. I have held the 
plow too long to look backward in 
the furrow. I am going on and 
up, by the help of the Lord, and 
to the best of my ability, until 1 
fill my mission and accomplish my 
work, whatever that may be. I 
thank the Lord for the Gospel; I 
thank Him for the testimony of 
it that I possess, and for the testi- 
mony that my brethren possess. 
That, to me, is worth more than 
gold, or silver, or precious stones. 
It is worth to me more than all the 
honors of the world to know that 
my brethren have the testimony 
of this Gospel in their hearts and 
that they know the truth, as they 
have said it here. There may be 
those who know it much better than 
I do, if only they have larger con- 
ception and comprehension of the 
truth, and greater capacity to re- 
ceive and comprehend it. They 
may go much farther than I can, 
perhaps, in this world; but I hope 
to live long enough in eternity to 
catch up with them, if I can. 

May the Lord bless this people; 
and in the name of the Lord, and 
by virtue of the Holy Melchizedek 
Priesthood, which holds the keys 
of all the spiritual blessings of the 
Church, I bless the Latter-day 
Saints and our friendis '(gathered 
here, and also the Latter-day Saints 
and the people of God everywhere, 



throughout the intermountain states 
and throughout all the world. God 
bless His people — make them rich 
in the knowledge of the truth, in 
humility, in meekness, and willing- 
ness to obey the word of the Lord 
and keep His commandments, and 
help them to keep pure and un- 
spotted from the world, and at His 
own pleasure and time those afar 
off may be permitted to gather to 
the house of the Lord where they 
may enter and administer not only 
for their own temporal and eter- 
nal union and exaltation, but where 
they may enter and administer for 
the salvation and exaltation of their 
kindred who have died without the 
knowledge of the Gospel. This is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

President Smith then read the re- 
port of the auditing committee, as 
follows :

institutions of the Church, for the 
year 1911, and are pleased to report 
that we have found the books and 
accounts methodically and accurate- 
ly kept according to the most ap-

following comment : 

And this is but a very brief re- 
port, of their full report, which 
covers thirty-two pages of data and 
commentation in relation to their 
researches into the financial affairs 
of the Church ; and in every respect 
this simple report is corroborative 
of their report in detail. 

It was announced that the daily 
recitals on the great organ, to which 
the public is admitted free, will be 
resumed on 22nd Inst.

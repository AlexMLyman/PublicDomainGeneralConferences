Book Stores Combine 
for Bigger Service 

The Sunday School Union Book Store and the Deseret 
News Book Store have heen combined under a single man- 
agement. Both stores will continue in business, however, 
at their present respective locations. 

The change was made to bring about a bigger and bet- 
ter service — the kind of service that always results from a 
close union of interests. The best merchandising traditions 
of both stores will be preserved, while a common service 
standard will be maintained. 

To serve the best interests of the reading public 
promptly, efficiently and intelligently will be the constant 
aim of the combined institutions. They have served well 
in the past and built up an immense patronage, but con- 
stant improvement in every detail of book merchandising 
will be the guiding slogan of both stores. 

The combined stores have facilities for handling the 
vast trade of the intermountain country. Patrons that can- 
not visit the stores in person can be efficiently served 
through a careful and prompt mailing department. 

You are always welcome to visit our stores and browse 
among the books. Write for book lists, mailing rates, etc.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The choir and congregation sang: 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear. 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 
"Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this, and joy your hearts will swell — 

All is well! all is well! 

Why should we mourn, or think our lot is hard? 
'Tis not so; all is right! 

Why should we think to earn a great reward, 
If we now shun the fight? 

Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 

Our God will never us forsake; 

And soon we'll have this tale to tell- 
All is well! all is well! 

We'll find the place which God for us prepared, 

Far away in the West; 
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; 

There the Saints will be blest. 
We'll make the air with music ring, 
Shout praises to our God and King; . 
Above the rest these words we'll tell — 
. All is well! all is well! 

And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! all is well! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too, 

With the just we shall dwell. 
But if our lives are spared again 
To see the Saints their rest obtain, 
O how we'll make this chorus swell — 

All is well! all is well! 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Edward H. Anderson, 
f the presidency of the Granite stake of Zion. 
The choir and congregationg sang: 

Do what is right; the day-dawn is breaking, 

Hailing a future of freedom and light; 
Angels above us are silent notes taking 

Of every action; do what is right! 
CHORUS : 

Do what is right, let the consequence follow; 

Batle for freedom in spirit and might. 
And with stout hearts look ye forth till tomorrow; 

God will protect you, do what is right! 

Do what is right; the shackles are falling; 

Chains of the bondsmen no longer are bright; 
Lighten'd by hope, soon they'll cease to be galling; 

Truth goeth onward: do what is right! 

Do what is right; be faithful and fearless, 
Onward, press onward, the goal is in sight; 

Eyes that are wet now, ere long will be tearless; 
Blessings av/ait you; do what is right. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice again at having the opportunity of meeting with the 
Saints in general conference. It was a source of great regret to all 
of us that we could not hold our April conference because of health 
conditions throughout the state. I am gratified, seeing that our post- 
poned conference was only last June, that we have as large an attend- 
ance as we have here today. 

DEPENDENCE UPON THE LORD 

In standing before you today I feel my weakness and my de- 
pendence upon the Lord, and I pray for the faith, sympathy and good 
will of all who are here assembled, that what I may say shall be for 
their benefit as well as for my own. I can hardly realize that I am 
standing here as your representative, at the head of the Church. When 
I think of the men who have occupied this position, from President 
Brigham Young to President Joseph F. Smith, I indeed feel weak, 
but my faith and my knowledge regarding the divinity of the work 
in which we are engaged are so perfect that I have no doubt whatever 
that the Lord will give to me, with vhe aid of my counselors and the 
Council of the Twelve, with whom I meet in council every week, the 
inspiration to guide and direct the affairs of this Church in a way 
and manner which will be pleasing and acceptable to him. I have the 
same faith as that expressed by Nephi of old: namely, that the Lord 
requires no labor or work at the hands of man but what he will prepare 
a way whereby that labor can be accomplished. If I know my own 
heart, it is' set absolutely upon seeking for the mind and the will of the 
Lord, and, then laboring, to the full extent of the ability with which 
I am endowed, to accomplish his purposes. 

THE HYMN, "COME, COME, YE SAINTS" 

Yesterday, or the day before, when I received a list of the songs 
that would be sung during this conference, I read them over without 
any particular thought as to their meaning or inspiration, but this 
morning while lying in bed thinking of this conference, I remembered 
that the first hymn that we were to sing here today was, "Come, come, 
ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear." I concluded to make that my text 
for my opening remarks, and then speak as I might be led during the 
remainder of the time I should occupy. To me this is a wonderful 
hymn, and the circumstances under which it was written, as I have 
been informed, give it an additional interest to me. I understand that 
when the pioneers were about to start across the trackless wilderness, 
to go a thousand miles to a place they knew not where, a place that 
President Brigham Young had seen in vision, he said to Elder William 
Clayton, "William, go and write a hymn that the Saints may sing at 
their camp fires, that shall be an inspiration and an encouragement to

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them in their journey across the plains," and Brother Clayton withdrew 
and returned in a couple of hours with this great pioneer hymn that 
we have just sung. I was asked in Liverpool, by President Lyman, 
the day I arrived there to preside over the European mission, which 
of all the hymns was my favorite, and he said, "We will sing it tonight !" 
I told him I had none, that there were many of the hymns I loved 
dearly, but I had never selected any one as my special favorite. He 
said, "My favorite is 'School thy feelings, oh, my brother, Train thy 
warm, impulsive soul ;' President Snow's favorite was, 'Zion stands with 
hills surrounded; * * * All her foes shall be confounded;' John 
Henry Smith's was, 'Up, awake, ye defenders of Zion ;' President Wil- 
ford Woodruff's was, -'God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to 
perform ;' and President Lyman said that Presidentt Brigham Young's 
was, "Oh, ye mountains high ;" but I have since been told by one of his 
daughters that this is a mistake, that his favorite was Brother William 
Clayton's hymn, "When first the glorious light of truth, burst forth in 
this last age, How few there were with heart and soul, to obey it did 
engage." President Daniel H. Wells' favorite was, "Oh, ye mountains 
high." I said, "Brother Lyman, you don't need to go any further; 
I will pick mine inside of a minute. I will take, "Come, come, ye 
Saints, ' as my favorite." 

I believe that William Clayton was inspired of the Lord when he 
wrote this hymn, and also the other hymn that was President Young's 
favorite. It was a wonderful trip the Pioneers were about to make. I 
can never think of it but I have admiration for the courage, the faith, 
and the will power of our fathers and our mothers who started out in 
the wilderness, not knowing where they were going, but singing : 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way. 

I have talked with hundreds of those who crossed the plains and 
they had real joy and happiness in wending their way to this country. 

Though hard to you this journey may appear, 
Grace shall be as your day. 

Certainly God did give them grace as their day. 

'Tis better far for us to strive, 
Our useless cares from us to drive, 
Do this, and joy your hearts will swell — 
All is well! all is well! 

And not only was that good advice to people traveling across, the 
plains, but it is good advice to each and to all of us every day of our 
lives. A cheerful, happy spirit of serenity is pleasing to our heavenly 
Father. The capacity and the ability to believe and accept the scripture 
that teaches us to acknowledge the hand of God in all things is pleasing 
to our heavenly Father. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard? 

"Tis not so; all is right! 
Why should we think to earn a great reward, 

If we now shun the fight? 

The trouble with a great many people is, they are not willing to 
pay the price; they are not willing to make the fight for success in the 
battle of life. They are much like the people of whom I read in 
Brother N. L. Nelson's book on preaching — which I happened to open 
one day, and I read about people taking literally the instructions to 
take no thought of what one should say; and Brother Nelson wrote 
that many of those who took no thought at all never said much, as they 
were going contrary to the teaching, that we were to prepare ourselves ; 
and he says, regarding the people who take no thought, that when 
they speak they ought to say, "Oh, Lord, here I am. I have a mouth 
nnd a pair of lungs that I will loan thee for a brief season; fill me with 
wisdom that I may edify the people," which he seldom does. 

Why should we think to earn a great reward, 

If we now shun the fight? 
Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 
Our God will never us forsake; 
And soon we'll have this tale to tell — ■ 
All is well! all is well! 

This magnificent audience here, our beautiful temple, our Church 
office building, and the temples from Canada to Southern Utah, and 
in the Hawaiian Islands, bear witness to all the world that God has 
never forsaken his people. 

We'll find the place which God for us prepared, 

Far away in the West; 
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; 

There the Saints will be blest. 

I believe there is no true Latter-day Saint who does not believe 
that God did prepare this land for his people. Brigham Young stood 
on the hill, beyond Fort Douglas, and, looking over this valley, said : 
"This is the place." God had shown him this place in vision, before 
he ever came here. Men tried to persuade him to go to California to 
that rich country, but this was the place which God had prepared, and 
we stopped here, and no mistake was made. 

We'll make the air with music ring, 
Shout praises to our God and King; 
Above the rest these words we'll tell — 
All is well! All is well! 
And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! All is well! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too, 
With the just we shall dwell.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



What sublime faith — that all is well! even should you die in the 
wilderness, and be buried in an unknown grave, so to speak; and yet 
that was their faith ; and they could sing these words, night after night, 
with their hearts in what they sang. They were verily praying to the 
Lord. They had full faith -jn the revelations given to the wife of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, wherein it is written : "The song of the right- 
eous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon 
their heads." Also : "My soul delighteth in the song of the heart." 

And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! All is well! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too, 

With the just we shall dwell. 
But if our lives are spared again 
To see the Saints their rest obtain. 
O how we'll make this chorus swell — 

All is well, all is well! 

I remember upon one occasion, and I have often spoken of it — 
I may have mentioned it here, — that my father-in-law, the late Oscar 
Winters, said : "Heber, I believe that the young people of Zion do not 
thoroughly appreciate what Brother Clayton's hymn meant to us, as 
we sang it, night after night, crossing the plains ; and I believe that 
choir leaders do not appreciate it, or they would not stop after singing 
only three verses. I have listened in vain," as I remember it, he said, 
"for between twenty-five and thirty years, to hear the last verse of 
that song sung by a choir, and I have never heard it." 

We are beginning to sing it now, because in almost every stake 
of Zion I have asked the people and the leaders of choirs, that if they 
only wished to sing three verses, please not to do it when I waapresent 
— but to sing the other verse also." 

A TOUCHING INCIDENT OF THE PLAINS 

Brother Winters further said, "I want to tell vou an incident that 
happened as I was coming to the valley. One of our company was 
delayed in coming to camp. We got some volunteers, and were about 
to -go back and see if anything had happened, — if he had had trouble 
with Indians, or what was the matter, — when we saw him coming 1 in 
the distance. When he arrived, we unyoked his cattle and helped him 
to get his supper. He had been quite sick and had to lie down by the 
road, a time or two. After supper he sat down on a large rock, by 
the camp fire, and sang the hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints." It was 
the rule in the camp that whenever anybody started to sing that hymn, 
we would all ioin with him ; but for some reason, no one joined with 
this brother. His voice was quite weak and feeble ; and when he had 
finished. I glanced around, and I don't believe there were any of the 
neople sitting- there whose eyes were tearless. He sang the hymn very 
beautifully, but with a weak and plaintive voice, and yet with the spirit 
and inspiration of the hvmn. The next morning we discovered that 
he was not hitching up his oxen ; we went to his wagon, and we found 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

that he had died during the night ! We dug a shallow grave and laid 
his body in it. We then thought of the stone on which he had been 
sitting the night before when he sang: 

"And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day! All is well! 
W; then are free from toil and sorrow too, 

With the just we shall dwell. 

"We then rolled that stone over in place as a headstone for his 
grave." 

I noticed tears in Brother Winters' eyes. He started, as if he was 
about to tell me something more, but he hesitated and did not. I 
subsequently learned that after he had been in the valley for some time 
he came from his home in the country to Salt Lake to meet his mother, 
only to learn that she, too', had died before her journey was through. 

ALONG THE "MORMON" TRAIL. 

Some years ago, as the Burlington Railroad was building through 
Nebraska and Wyoming, the engineers found a piece of wagon tire 
sticking in the ground, on which was chiseled the word, "Winters." 
They wrote to Salt Lake City, telling of this discovery, and they re- 
turned several miles and kindly changed the line, of the road so as 
to miss that spot, knowing that it was the grave of some Utah pioneer. 
We have since erected, there, a little monument to the memory of 
Grandma Winters.^ and, on one side of that little monument, built 
of temple granite, we have had chiseled the words in the last verse of, 
"Come, come, ye Saints." Never can I hear this song, never can I 
read it, but my heart goes out in gratitude to my father and to my 
mother, and to thousands of those noble men and women who journ- 
eyed over the plains. Many of them, time and time again, crossed the 
plains to help others, enduring the hardships cheerfully, carrying out, 
in very deed, the teachings of this inspired hymn ! I can never think 
of them but I am full of admiration and gratitude, and utter a prayer 
to the Lord to help me, as one of the descendants of that noble band, 
to be loyal, to be true, to be faithful as they were ! In very deed, they 
were a band of men and women who, as the years come and go, will 
command greater and greater admiration and respect from the peo- 
ple of the world. 

REASONS FOR THE PEOPLE'S COMING/ 

They came here, for what? Because of the burning and living 
testimony in their souls regarding the divine mission of our Lord and 
Master, Jesus Christ. They came here because they had an abiding 
knowledge that God lives, that he hears and answers prayers, that Jesus 
is the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith is his prophet.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God had given them that knowledge ! When I think of this land today, 
and of the prosperity and peace that reign here, from Canada on the 
north to Arizona on the south, I indeed marvel and thank God. When 
I think that there is, perhaps, no other part of the United States more 
peaceful, more free from mob violence, and from those evils which 
disturb the serenity of people and cause them great unrest and anxiety, 
I am indeed grateful, and feel to bear witness to the inspiration of Wil- 
liam Clayton, under a direct appointment from Brigham Young, the 
prophet of the Lord, to write a hymn that should so cheer the Saints. 
I acknowledge the inspiration expressed in the words that they would 
find the place that God had prepared far away in the West! When I 
think of the awful devastation that swept over the country, from which 
the Latter-day Saints were driven in Missouri and Illisois and other 
places during the Rebellion I am grateful that the Latter-day Saints 
escaped that awful state of affairs, and I feel to acknowledge the hand 
of the Lord. They came here for what? For the express purpose to 
serve God, to do right, as stated in the'next hymn that we sang. I 
think this other hymn is worthy to be counted as a battle hymn : 

Do what is right; the day-dawn is breaking, 

Hailing_-a future of freedom and light; 
Angels above us are silent notes taking 

Of every action; do what is right! 

\io what is right; the shackles are falling; 

Chains of the bondsmen no longer are bright; 
Lighten'd by hope, soon they'll cease to be galling; 

Truth goeth onward: do what-is right! 

Do wh..t is riglu; be faithful and fearless, 
Onward, press onward, the goal is in sight; 

Eyes that are wet now, ere long will be tearless; 
Blessing's await you; do what is right. 

Do what is right, let the consequence follow; 

Battle for freedom in spirit and might. 
And with stout hearts look y: forth till tomorrow; 

God will protect you; do what is right! 

That is what om falhers and mothers came here for. Our late 
beloved President, Joseph F. Smith, from the time be was a child, 
ten years of age, when he crossed the plains, driving the team for his 
beloved mother, until the day of his death, labored seventy long years, 
in season and out of season, doing what was right, on all occasions 
and under all circumstances. I asked him, one day, which was his 
favorite hymn, and he said he did not have any. I said, "Well, 
Brother Lyman told me I ought to have one. I wish you would select 
one." "Well," he said, "I think I would hardly care to, but perhaps 
I am partial to the hymn by that heroic little soul, Sister Emily Hill 
Woodmansee, entitled, "Uphold the Right;" 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



9 



Uphold the right, tho' fierce the fight, 

And pow'rful is the foe; 
As freedom's friend, her cause defend, 

Nor fear nor favor show. 
No coward can be called a man — 

No friend will friends betray; 
Who would be free, alert must be; 

Indifference will not pay. 

Note how they toil, whose ai n is spoil, 

Who plundering plots devise; 
Yet time will teach, that fools o'erreach 

The mark, and lose the prize. 
Can justice deign to wrong maintain, 

Whoever wills it so? 
Can honor mate with treach'rous hate? 

Can figs on thistles grow? 

Dare to be true, and hopeful too; 

Be watchful, brave and shrewd; 
Weigh every act; be wise, in fact, 

To serve the general good. 
Nor basely yield, nor quit the field — 

Important is the fray; 
Scorn to recede, there is no need 

To give our rights away. 

Left-handed fraud let those applaud 

Who would by fraud prevail; 
In freedom's name contest their claim, 

Use no such word as fail; 
Honor we must each sacred trust, 

And rightful zeal display; 
Our part fulfil, then, come what will, 

High heaven will clear the way. 

WHY WE ARE. UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO SERVE GOD. 

Certainly President Smith's life was an example of courage and 
willingness to do the right, without fear to announce himself ori any 
proposition for the good of mankind. 

As I think of the wonderful prosperity of the Latter-day Saints, 
of what they have accomplished, of what they are accomplishing, and 
of the respect that is being shown them today, in comparison with the 
contempt that was shown to them years ago, I certainly fee.1 to thank 
the Lord for all of his mercies and blessings to us, and to beg, en- 
treat, and implore every Latter-day Saint to so order his or her life 
that they will in very deed do that which is right, let the consequence 
follow. With all -the power that I possess, I would urge upon the 
Latter-day Saints the keeping of the commandments of the Lord. There 
is nothing truer than the statement that obedience is better than sacri- 
fice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. The man and the woman 
who obeys the commandments of the Lord grows and increases in 
light, in knowledge, in intelligence ; and above all, they grow in the 
testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. When I think of all that we have 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



accomplished and of our being here in fulfilment of the prediction of 
Joseph Smith that the Latter-day Saints should come to these Rocky 
Mountains and become a great and a mighty people, I am reminded 
of the sufferings, the hardships, and the trials that the people under- 
went in their drivings and expulsions from Missouri and Illinois, and 
I feel to say, truly God has preserved and blessed us in this land, and 
we are under obligations to him to serve him, so that those who know 
not the truth, may see the honesty, the integrity, the devotion of our 
lives, that these may inspire them to investigate the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

We are told in revelation from the Lord that we should be anx- 
iously engaged in a good cause, and that we should bring to pass 
much righteousness of our own free will and choice, for we are agents 
unto ourselves ; and wherein we do good, we shall in no wise lose our 
reward. I am always thankful when I read in the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants that there is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the 
foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated, and 
that when we obtain any blessing it is by obedience to the law upon 
which it is predicated. When I go into a house to administer to those 
who are afflicted, if I know that they have observed, what is known 
as the Word of Wisdom ; if I know they have fulfilled the law where- 
by they are entitled to the blessings of the Lord, I can administer to 
people of that kind with faith, knowing that if it is not the will of the 
Lord for them to pass away, he will hear and answer the prayer of 
faith, and they will be restored. 

GOD'S ANSWER TO A PRAYER OF JOSEPH, THE PROPHET. 

When I stop to think of the condition our people was in years 
ago and that some of the great and important revelations that have 
come to this Church, came to us from prison -cells — today,, I say, what 
a wonderful contrast ! Certainly God' has been good to this people. 
I think one of the greatest of all the revelations that we have is the 
one "that came to us in answer to a prayer from the Prophet Joseph 
Smith when he was in Liberty Jail, in Clay county, Missouri, on the 
- 20th day of March, 1839. He prayed to the Lord: 

O God! where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy 
hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea 
thy pure eye, behold, from the eternal heavens, the wrongs of thy people 
and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their crlss? etc. 

In answer to this, the Lord states, among other important items : 

"How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder 
the Almighty, from pouring down knowledge from heaven, upon the heads 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why arr 
they not chosen? 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

"That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be 'conferred upon us, it is true; but when we under- 
take to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exer- 
cise control, £>r dominion or compulsion, upon the souls of the children of 
men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw them- 
selves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen 
to the Priesthood, or the authority of that man. 

"Behold! ere he is aware, he is left unto himseelf, to kick against the 
pricks; to persecute the saints, and to fight against God. 

"We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and disposi- 
tion of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they sup- 
pose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile, 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him 
whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy. 

"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death; 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of' faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine 
of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy sceptre an 
unchanging sceptre of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall be 
an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto 
thee for, ever and ever." 

Placing the Prophet in a jail did not stop communication be- 
tween God, our heavenly Father, and his chosen instrument here upon 
the earth. One of the greatest of all the great lessons that has come 
to us who hold the Priesthood, was given while he was in jail, — "No 
power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and' 
meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness and pure knowledge, 
which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy," and so on. 
The Lord being my helper, standing at the head of this great Church, 
I shall endeavor to exercise the Priesthood that I hold in conformity 
with this revelation from the living God to the Prophet of the Lord, who 
was used as his instrument in founding the Church of Christ again upon 
the earth. 

GRATITUDE TO GOD. 

I thank the Lord for all his manifold blessings to us as a people. 
The Saints are prosperous, they are in good health now. We are meet- 
ing with blessings on all hands. I rejoice in this and feel grateful to

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Lord. I pray that, while we are together, we may be abund- 
antly blessed by those that shall speak to us. 

POSITION ON THE QUESTION OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 

I did think of making some remarks similar to those I made here 
two weeks ago today, but I believe that I will do as the congressmen 
do. Instead of referring to my position upon the League of Nations 
and other matters, as I did two weeks ago, I will simply have printed 
in the conferenoe proceedings the sermon that I then delivered, and 
you can read it at your leisure. It was printed in the Deseret News, I 
believe, a week ago last Tuesday. I will not take the time to repeat 
what I said. I read there a manifesto sent to the Senate of the United 
States begging them to pass the Peace Treaty, and I will simply have 
my sermon incorporated in our conference proceedings so that any 
of the Saints who want to read it can do so, and I will ask Brother 
Edward H. Anderson, the editor of the Era also to print my sermon 
in the Era, so that those of you who take that magazine will have the 
privilege of reading it. If there is any home in all the Church that does 
not have the Era, it simply shows that the people there are lacking in 
faith, that they think more of two dollars than they do of getting com- 
munications from the authorities of the Church, and important ser- 
mons, things which are of more value than the things of this world. 
You know there are a great many people who hold up copper cents 
in front of their eyes and hide dollars, and there are a great many 
who keep two dollars in their pockets and hide hundreds of dollars of 
inspiration and knowledge of great value to them through all time, 
and which will be of value to them in the great eternity to come. 

UPHOLD THE LAW. 

As Latter-day Saints we have what is known as The Articles of 
Faith, and one of them reads : "We believe in being subject to kings, 
presidents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining 
the law," and no Latter-day Saint can in very deed be a Latter-day 
Saint if he does not honor and sustain and uphold the law. Nearly 
all over the world, at the present time there is a spirit of lawlessness, 
a spirit of ridicule, and one lacking respect for the men who hold 
positions. 

One of the most terrible crimes that I have read of in years was 
enacted in Omaha, a few days ago, where a mob of citizens, because 
the policemen were trying to fulfil their duty as sworn servants of 
the law — had the officers in a building that was burning and said : "Let 
them burn," Let them burn — why? Because they would not deliver a 
prisoner to the mob, but kept that prisoner so that he could have a fair 
trial under the law. / 

When I was in Los Angeles a short time ago, they were selling 
whisky all over the city, and I was told that the officials of the city 
said, "You can sell it if you want to, we do not object, but you will 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



13 



have to take your chances with Uncle Sam." What kind of public 
servants are they? Elected to enforce laws, they defy the laws of 
their own country, and allow people to sell whisky and to break the 
law-! No wonder mob violence comes, when some of the leaders 
themselves break the law. No wonder they had this great war in 
Europe when the leaders of nations broke treaties and treated them 
as scraps of paper ! No man can do that which is dishonest, or break 
laws of his country and be a true Latter-day Saint. No nation and 
no leaders of nations can do wrong, and break their obligations, but 
what they are just as much under condemnation before God and man as 
the other individual who does wrong. Truth will prevail. "Uphold 
the right, though fierce the fight," should be the motto of every Lat- 
ter-day Saint, as it was the motto of our beloved leader who recently 
passed away. 

ON LABOR UNIONS. 

I want to say that I am perfectly willing that men shall join 
labor unions, that they shall band together for the purpose of pro- 
tecting their rights, provided they do not interfere with the rights 
of other people. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness belong to 
all people in the United States, according to the laws of our country, 
and should, upon all the face of the earth ; and I say that, to my mind, 
a provision in a labor union is all wrong that favors boycotting and 
the laying down of tools or the quitting of employment because a non- 
union man obtains employment while exercising his God-given right 
to stay out of a union. Men who have that kind of a rule have a 
rule that is in direct opposition to the laws of God. There was a 
'battle fought in heaven — for what? To give to man his individual 
liberty. An attempt to take the agency of man away is made when he 
does not see fit to join a union, when men in that union, without any 
complaint, or grievance, strike, because a non-union man is employed. 

Now I'd better not say any mor.e, perhaps, on this question, or I 
may offend somebody. I may hurt somebody's feelings ; but it is the 
God-given right of men to earn their livelihood. The Savior said it 
was the first great law or commandment to love the Lord with all 
our hearts, and that the second was like unto it, to love thy neighbor 
as thyself. That is the doctrine for every true Latter-day Saint. How 
much love is there in starving your neighbor because he will not 
surrender his manhood and his individuality, and allow a labor union 
to direct his labor? Mighty little love, misdity little of the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ in any such a rule ! I hope to see the day when 
no Latter-day Saint will join a union unless the union eliminate that 
clause from its rules. I am not going to ask them to leave their 
union, I am not going to lay it down that they must, that it is the 
mind and the will of the Lord for them to leave a union. I want, as 
I said here two weeks ago, to give every man his free agency, to give 
every man the right to act as he thinks proper, but I cannot see how 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a Latter-day Saint who is a member of such a union can get down on 
his knees and pray for God to inspire and bless him, to bless the Saints 
and to protect them, and then be a party to allowing one of his own 
brethren to go, year after year, without employment, because that 
brother will not surrender his manhood and join a union with him. 
There is none of the Spirit of the Lord in that, to my mind. That is 
exactly the way I see it. I will quote again what I quoted here two 
weeks ago : 



Should you feel inclined to censure 
Faults you may in others view, 

Ask your own heart, ere you venture, 
If that has not failings too. 

Let not friendly vows be broken; 

Rather strive a friend to gain; 
Many a word in anger spoken, 

Finds its passage home again. 

Do not then in idle pleasure 
Trifle with a brother's fame, 

Guard it as a valued treasure, 
Sacred as your own good name. 

Do not form opinions blindly; 

Hastiness to trouble tends. 
Those of whom we thought unkindly 

Oft become our warmest friends. 

Also this poem: 

Let each man learn to know himself: 

To gain that knowledge, let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself, 

Which he condemned so in his neighbor. 
How lenient our own faults we view, 

And conscience' voice adeptly smother; 
But oh! how harshly we review 

The self-same errors in another. 



And if you meet an erring one, 

Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast the stone, 

If you yourself be pure and faultless. 
Oh! list to that small voice within, 

Whose whisperings oft make men confounded, 
And trumpet not another's sin, 

You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 

And in self-judgment, if you find 
Your deeds to others are superior; 

To you has Providence been kind, 
As you should be to those inferior; 

Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light, which men are apt to borrow; 

So first, improve yourself today, 

And then improve your friends tomorrow.

CLOSING TESTIMONY. 

I thank the Lord that I am able to bear witness to you here today 
that I know that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers ; 
that I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, the 
Savior of mankind. I bear my witness to you here today that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, that he was the 
instrument in the hands of God of establishing again upon the earth 
the plan of life and salvation, not only for the living but for the dead, 
and that this gospel, commonly called "Mormonism," by the people 
of the world, is in very deed the plan of life and salvation, the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, that the little stone has been cut out 
of the mountain, and that it shall roll forth until it fills the whole earth. 
We believe in the restoration of the Ten Tribes ; we believe in the 
literal gathering of Israel, and we believe that Zion shall be built upon 
this, the American continent, and that Christ shall reign personally 
upon the earth. May God help us who have a testimony q£ the gos- 
pel to so live that if we are upon the earth when he comes to reign, 
we will be worthy to be*welcomed by him; and if we go beyond be- 
fore he comes to reign, that we shall receive the plaudit, "Well done, 
thou good and faithful servant; enter into the joy of the Lord," is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

DISCOURSE OF PRESIDENT HEBER T. GRANT 

In Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, September 21. 1919, in the after- 
noon of Salt Lake stake conference — Defines attitude on Treaty of 
Peace — -"Standard Works of the Church are not opposed to the League 
of Nations — United States should stand bv her allies — Ghange in treatv 
terms making resubmission to Germany necessary, would be a calamity" 
Allusions to great event in Church history occurring ninety-six- years 
ago — Visits of Ansrel Moroni and other heavenly beings to Joseph 
Smith — Analysis of Articles of Faith — Personal experiences — Powerful 
testimony of restoration of the gospel. 

T am grateful for the opportunity of again meeting with the Lat- 
ter-dav Saints in public worship. It is ever a pleasure to me to meet 
with the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and also, when opportunity presents, to meet with those not of our faith, 
to explain our faith to those who are not familiar with it, and to bear 
witness of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. 

Before speaking today on matters pertaining to our faith, I desire 
to make a brief statement. I have been requested, by word of mouth 
and bv letter, on more than one occasion, to state mv opinion regarding 
the league of nations. I received a telegram asking me to ioin ex- 
President Taft. ex- Attorney General Wickersham, President Lowell of 
Harvard, and other leading Americans, in signing the following mani- 
festo : 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In the senate at Washington, now that the committee on foreign rela- 
tions has reported the treaty, the lines are sharply drawn between the im- 
mediate_ ratification of the treaty of peace with Germany, and its amend- 
ment with a reassembling of the conference and a reopening of negotiations 
that would bring great delay and prolonged uncertainty in settling the 
great issues of the peace. No partisan plea can be made. Party lines are 
already broken. 

Standing at a distance from the conflict in the senate chamber, we plead 
for immediate ratification without delay. Our land requires it. A state 
of nervous strain, tension, and unrest exists, manifesting itself in distur- 
bances, which in some cases have no self-evident connection with the war, 
but which are in fact its aftermath. The world is put in imminent peril of 
new wars by the lapse of each day. Dissensions between us and our former 
allies are being sown. We firmly believe and solemnly declare that the 
states and cities in which we dwell desire immediate peace. 

The waging of war steadied and united the American people. Peace 
will bring prosperity, and prosperity content. Delay in the senate post- 
poning ratification in this uncertain period of neither peace nor war has 
resulted in indecision and doubt, bred strife, and quickened the cupidity 
of those who sell the daily necessities of life and the fears of those whose 
daily wage* no longer fills tire daily market basket. 

We beseech the senate to give the land peace and certainty by a rati- 
fication which will not keep us longer in the shadows of possible wars, but 
give the whole world the light of peace. Reservations m the nature of 
clarifications in the meaning of the treaty, not inconsistent with its terms, 
will not require the reopening of the negotiations with Germany and with 
our associates in the war, which we all and each united to win. 

But there is no possibility of doubt th^t amendment of the treaty, as is 
now proposed by the senate committee on foreign relations, would require 
negotiation and a reopening of all the questions decided at Paris. Months 
of delay would follow. The perils of the present would become the deadly 
dangers of the near future. All the doubt engendered would aid the plots 
for violent revolution in this and other lands. The issues here and else- 
where between capital and labor, the conspiracy of speculator and profiteer, 
would all grow, and become more perilous. 

This cannot be. The American people cannot, after a victorious war, 
permit its government to petition Germany, which has accepted the treaty, 
for its consent to changes in the treaty. Yet, if the United States should 
amend the treaty for its own purpose and policy, Germany would have 
full right to ask for concessions. Germany has agreed to make no claim 
in regard to enemy property seized in this country to an amount of seven 
hundred million dollars. Our recent foe could ask for a reopening of this 
issue and of the Lusitania claims. It could raise every question open be- 
fore hostilities in regard to submarine warfare and the treatment of its 
nationals in this country. All the provisions for our trade in Germany 
raised by the economic clauses of the treaty, many of them vital to our 
industries and our farms, as in dye patents, dye supplies and fertilizers, 
the working of the reparation commission which superintends the trade of 
all with GermaYiy could all be brought up by Berlin for readjustment by our 
negotiators, acting for the United States alone and no longer associated, 
with other victorious powers or supported by a victorious American army 
on the German border. 

Peace is delayed until ratification comes. And any amendment post- 
pones peace. Germany and England alone of the principal powers have 
ratified. The other principals necessarily await our action, influential and 
powerful as we are today, in the world's affairs. The ravages of war 
on more than a score of fighting fronts are continued by our needless delay. 
Let the senate give the world peace by ratification without amendment. 

Even the amendment for which most can be said, the provision in regard 
to Shantung, will secure nothing which cannot be gained if China, backed 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



17 



by the powerful advocacy of the United States, addresses itself to the ma- 
chinery for righting international wrongs and meeting just claims created 
by the league between nations, China after eighty years of oppressive 
treaties and despoiled rights, by which all the great powers have profited ' 
directly or indirectly, has for the first time, in this covenant and treaty, 
the means and method to secure justice and the removal of the oppressive 
economic interference of stronger nations whose citizens are within her 
gates, protected by a long succession of international agreements. More- 
over, it should be remembered that the clause regarding Shantung was made 
upon the statement by Japan that she will return the territory to China and, 
therefore, upon that condition; compliance with which promise the league 
can require. 

The peace of the present and the righteousness of the future -can be 
best secured by the ratification of the covenant and treaty without amend- 
ment. Let the senate take no action that will give any party to the 
treaty, and especially Germany, ground for maintaining that the ratification 
of the United States is not complete and that changes requiring a resump- 
tion of conference and negotiations have been made in it. 

I replied as follows : 

I have pleasure in joining ex-President Taft and other leading Ameri- 
cans in signing manifesto as outlined in your telegram of yesterday. 

The sentiments contained in the above manifesto express my per- 
sonal position with regard to the league of nations ; and since signing 
the telegram I have neither heard nor read anything that has in any 
degree changed my position on this important question. 

I regret exceedingly that the standard works of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been brought into this contro- 
versy, which has now become practically a partisan controversy. It is 
my opinion that this important question should have been kept abso- 
lutely out of politics. 

On . one important matter I desire to place the position of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fairly before the people. 
An illustrated hand-bill has been circulated and has been widely repub- 
lished in newspapers under the heading : "Mormon Bible Prophecies 
Become Issue in Opposition to the League of Nations." The position 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that the standard 
works of the Church are not opposed to the league of nations. 

As stated in what I have read to you, I regret exceedingly that 
this great and important question has become a political issue, and I 
desire to ask each and all of the members of the Church, over which I 
have the honor to preside, that in all their controversy in connection 
with this great issue, they express themselves as to their views with due 
deference to the opinions of others. During the controversy I would 
like them to read, occasionally, the very wonderful and inspired hymn 
"O say, what is truth ?" written by John Jaques, to be found on page 71 
of our hymn book : 

O, say what is truth? 'Tis the fairest gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce; 
And priceless the value of truth will be when 
The proud monarch's costliest diadem 

Is counted but dross and refuse. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Yes, say what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or Gqds can aspire; 
Go, search in the depths where it glittering lies, 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies; 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 

The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp, 

When with winds of stern justice he copes 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast, 

And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes, 

Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er; 
Though the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

On page 66 of our hymn book we find the following: 

Should you feel inclined to censure 

Faults you may in others view, 
Ask your own heart, ere you venture, 

If that has not failings too. 

Let not friendly vows be broken; 

Rather strive a friend to gain; 
Many a word in anger spoken 

Finds its passage home again. 

Do not then, in idle pleasure, 

Trifle with a brother's fame, 
Guard it as a valued treasure, 

Sacred as your own good name. 

Do not form opinions blindly; 

Hastiness to trouble tends, 
Those of whom we thought unkindly, 

Oft become our warmest friends. 

Seeing that I have gottten into the habit of quoting poetry, another 
poem has just come to mind', which I will repeat, as I think it will be 
of value to us in teaching us to have respect for the opinions of other 
^eople : 

LET EACH MAN LEARN TO KNOW HIMSELF. 

Let each man learn to know himself: 
To gain that knowledge, let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself, 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor. 
, How lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience' voice adeptly smother; 
But oh! how harshly we review 
The self-same errors in another! 

And if you meet an erring one 

Whose deeds are blamable or thoughtless, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



19 



Consider, ere you cast the stone, 

If you yourself be pure and faultless. 

Oh! list to that small voice within, 

Whose whisperings oft make men confounded, 

And trumpet not another's sin, 

You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 

And in self-judgment, if you find 

Your deeds to others are superior; 

To you has Providence been kind, 

As you should be to those inferior; 

Example sheds a genial ray 

Of light, which men are apt to borrow; 

Co first, improve yourself today, 

And then improve your friends tomorrow. 

Philip De La Mere. 

T regret exceedingly that in political controversies men seem to 
lack that courtesy and that respect for their opponents that I helieve all 
Latter-day Saints ought to have. I have never yet heard a Democrat 
make a political speech that I felt was fair to the Republicans. Being 
a Democrat, I shall not say anything about what I think of the speeches 
of Republicans regarding Democrats. Tt is a strange thing — but they 
sav that "Love is blind," and some people have added, "and can't smell." 
I have sometimes thought that both statements were true. From my 
own personal contact with dear and near friends, Republicans and 
Democrats, I have not been able to discover the exercise of what you 
might call charity, if you like, for the opinions of others who oppose 
them politically at least not as much charity as should exist among 
our people. I am a thorough convert myself to the idea that it is not 
possible for all men to see alike. You know the remark made by a man 
once : "It is a splendid thing that we do not all see alike, because if we 
did, everybody would want to marry my Sally Ann ;" and the other man 
remarked, "Yes, thank the Lord. If everybody saw your Sally Ann 
as I see her, nobody on earth would have her, and she would die an 
old maid." (Laughter.) 

I am convinced in my own feelings that Great Britain, France, and 
the United States have common aims, common desires, common ob- 
jects, and that a league in which those three nations are combined will 
mean peace as far as the acts of nations can bring peace to mankind. 
The three thousand miles of border between the United States and 
Canada, maintained for over a hundred years without the slightest 
trouble, without any great forts, such as they have felt obliged to have 
between Germany and France, and other European countries, gives 
me the absolute assurance in my heart that Great Britain and her sub- 
jects have the same desires for the welfare of mankind, and for the 
liberty of mankind, that we have here in the United States. Confi- 
dence begets confidence ; good will begets good will ; and I believe that 
having fought — for what? For our own existence, because I believe 
that but for the fact of our joining with the Allies in the great war, 
Germany wquld have conquered France and Great Britain, and that 
immedJatey thereafter she would have picked a quarrel with the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



United States, in the hope that this country, too, might be conquered. 
That Germany could not have conquered the United States I have no 
doubt. While representing you, as chairman of the Liberty loan com- 
mittee of the State of Utah, I attended a banquet in San Francisco, and 
in the course of a little speech of ten minutes — the limit given to me — 
I announced that we were sure to win the war ; that there was no 
doubt of it in my mind, absolutely none, because I accepted the state- 
ment of an inspired prophet of the living God, who resided on this 
continent hundreds of years ago, who said that this is a choice land 
above all other lands, and that no king should rule on this land. There- 
fore I have no fear of Germany or any other country conquering these 
United States of America — none whatever. But if Germany had con- 
quered France and England — which I believe she would have done but 
for our help — there would have been slain, instead of less than 100,000 
of our_boys, hundreds of thousands before we would have won the 
victory. I believe in my heart that it is our duty to stand by those 
nations that stood the brunt of the battle, and that saved us the loss of 
perhaps millions of our boys in the great struggle. I am not saying 
that I would not be delighted if this league of nations, or the terms of 
this covenant of peace, could be changed in some particulars, but they 
cannot be changed without submitting the treaty again to Germany. 
To my mind, that would be a calamity. 

Now, I did not intend to say this much regarding the league 
of nations, but rather to preach a little on the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

AN IMPORTANT ANNIVERSARY. 

Today is the ninety-sixth anniversary of that wonderful mani- 
festation from God, the visitation of an angel from heaven to the boy 
Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith testified to all the world that Moroni, 
an ancient prophet of God who resided upon this continent, appeared to 
him in answer to his prayer to the living God for light and knowledge. 
He states that his room started to become light, until it was as light as 
the noonday sun, and then a personage appeared before him, conversed 
with him, delivered a most important message, and quoted many im- 
portant passages of scripture, as you will find recorded here in a brief 
account of this wonderful event, given by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 
the Pearl of Great Price. I marked a number of passages that I 
thought I would read, but I will not take the time to do so. This angel 
delivered a message to Joseph Smith, and told him that in the Hill 
Cumorah there were buried golden plates containing a record of the 
forefathers of the American Indians. After delivering his message 
and quoting a lot of scripture to the boy, the messenger disappeared. 
He returned and repeated all that he had said before, and added a 
little additional scripture, then disappeared. He returned once more 
and repeated all that he had said upon the previous visits — and by 
this time it was morning. The boy dressed himself and went to the field 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



21 



to work, but his father, seeing that something was the matter with 
him, as he had been awake all night and was feeble, told him to go 
home. On his way home, while trying to climb over a fence, he fell 
and was awakened by the voice of the messenger, and for the fourth 
time these messages were delivered to the boy Joseph Smith, after 
which he told the boy to go to his father in the field and tell him all 
that he had heard from the messenger. Joseph went to his father and 
repeated the message that had been delivered to him by an angel of 
God, a former prophet who lived upon this earth, and his father said: 
"This message is from God," and told him to follow the instructions 
of the angel. Joseph Smith went to the place where the plates contain- 
ing the Book of Mormon record were buried, and when he was about 
to remove them, the angel told him the time had not yet come when the 
plates were to be delivered into his hands, but that he was to return to 
that spot once a year for four years, and then the plates were to be 
given to him. He did return once a 'year for four years, and upon 
each of those visits the angel of the Lord instructed this young man in 
the things of God, and prepared him to be the chosen instrument in 
the hands of the living God to restore again to the earth the plan of 
life and salvation, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Subsequently, 
John the Baptist, the man who baptized the Lord Jesus Christ, came 
and laid his hands upon the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
dery, and ordained those men to the Aaronic Priesthood, giving them 
the authority to baptize. After this ordination they went down into 
the waters of baptism and baptized each other. Subsequently, Peter, 
James, and John, the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had min- 
istered in the days of the Savior and after his crucifixion, came to tthe 
earth, and they -laid their hands upon the heads of Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery, and ordained the apostles of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, giving them all the keys, the powers, the rights and 
the authority to establish again the gospel plan and the Church of 
Jesus Christ upon the earth. "Oh," says the unbeliever, "we do not be- 
lieve that any messenger ever appeared to Joseph Smith ; we do not 
believe that John the Baptist laid his hands upon the heads of Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery ; we do not believe that Peter, James, and 
John ordained these men apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ." The un- 
belief of all the world cannot change those facts, if they are facts ; and 
we proclaim to the world that by the witness of the Holy Spirit we 
know that they are facts, and that they shall stand forever, for they 
can never be overthrown. The angel Moroni told the boy Joseph 
Smith that the day should come when an ancient prophet should appear 
and bestow the authority to turn the hearts of the children to the 
fathers. This promise was made years before the organization of this 
Church, and before the Book of Mormon was ever revealed, and a 
number of years later that promise was fulfilled, when that authority 
was given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in a wonderful vision 
and manifestation in the Kirtland temple, April 3, 1836 (Section 110, 
Doctrine and Covenants) :

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The vail was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understand- 
ing were opened. 

IWe saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before 
us, and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold in color like amber. 

His eyes were as a flame of fire, the hair of his head was white like 
the pure snow, his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun, 
and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even, the 
voice of Jehovah, saying: 

I am the first and the last, I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain, 
I am your advocate with the Father. 

Behold, your sins are forgiven you, you are clean before me, therefore 
lift up your heads and rejoice. 

Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my 
people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name. 

For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here, 
and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house, 

Yea, I will appear unto my servants, and speak unto them with mine 
own voice, if my people will keep my commandments, and do not pollute 
this holy house. 

Yea, the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice 
in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and the endow- 
ment with which my servants have been endowed in this house; 

And the fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands, and this is 
the beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads 
of my people. Even so. Amen. 

After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us, 
and Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the 
gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of 
the ten tribes from the land of the north. 

After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gos- 
pel of Abraham, saying, that in us, and our seed, all generations after us 
should be blessed. 

After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst 
upon us. Elijah the prophet who was taken to heaven without tasting 
death, stood before us, and said: 

Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth 
of Malachi, testifying that he (Elijah] should be sent befoie the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord come. 

To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to 
the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse. 

Therefore the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands, 
and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord 
is near, even at the doors. 

WHY WE BUILD TEMPLES. 

Millions of dollars have been invested in the Salt Lake temple. 
Month after month, as a boy, I contributed $1 a month. As my wages 
increased I contributed $2 a month, and later $3, $4, $5 and finally 
gave several thousands of dollars, towards the completion of that tem- 
ple. Why ? Because the Lord God Almighty had given me a knowl- 
edge that the hearts of the children have been turned to their fathers ; 
that the keys held by Elijah the prophet were in very deed delivered 
to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. The very granite bears witness 
to the faith, the knowledge and the testimony that God has given to 
the Latter-day Saints — not only this temple, but in Logan, in Manti, 
in St. George, temples have been erected to the same effect. In Canada

there is another temple, not yet completed, and one recently completed 
in the Hawaiian Islands, wherein ordinances for the dead can be per- 
formed. The temple still stands in Kirtland, Ohio, where these won- 
derful manifestations from God were given to the Latter-day Saints. 
By the revelations of the Spirit of God to them, they testify that these 
things did occur. There was also a temple at Nauvoo, Illinois, which 
was built under great stress — which our people built with the rifle in 
one hand, so to speak, and the trowel or the instruments used in 
building in the other. These temples, erected by the Saints in the days 
of their poverty, bear witness to all the world of the inspiration of God 
to those men and to the truthfulness of the visions in the Kirtland tem- 
ple. No men and women would spend their money by the millions of 
dollars for the erection of temples, and spend their time, year after year, 
laboring for the salvation of their dead, if they did not have the witness 
of the Holy Spirit that in very deed the promise has been fulfilled that 
was made to the boy Joseph Smith ninety-six years ago today, that 
Elijah should come and restore these keys. 

Almost simultaneously with this wonderful manifestation to the 
boy, this visitation of an angel of the living God, delivering a message 
and making promises regarding the organizaton of the Church and of 
many wonderful things, all of which have since been fulfilled, came a 
widespread impulse among men to acquire information concerning 
their dead progenitors. No person can deny, who will stop to reason 
upon it, that from the time of Elijah's visit, restoring the keys that he 
held, turning the hearts of the children to their fathers, there has come 
into the hearts of people all over the world a desire to know something 
about their ancestors. No truthful person can deny that this is the 
case. People will not believe, perhaps, that the turning of their hearts 
to the fathers, causing them to seek for information regarding their 
progenitors, is due to the fact that the keys had been turned in the 
temple at Kirtland ; but we know that is the case. I have met men and 
have conversed with them, who have spent years and years of their 
lives gathering the genealogy of their forefathers, and compiling books 
containing that information. When I have asked them why they did it, 
they would say that they did not know, but that they were seized with 
a strong, irresistible desire to find out the names of their ancestors 
and to compile them. Now that they have finished the record, they 
seem to have lost all interest in it. To a Latter-day Saint a book of this 
size [holding up the Book of Mormon], containing the names of his 
ancestors, is worth many, many times, hundreds of times more than its 
weight in gold, because to the Latter-day Saint has come a knowledge 
that he can in very deed be "a savior upon Mount Zion" of his kindred 
who have died without a knowledge of the truth. 

a visitor's conversion. 

I am reminded of the wonderful testimony that comes into the 
hearts of men regarding the divinity of this work in which we are en-

gaged, by the labors that were performed by a gentleman named R. M. 
Bryce-Thomas, a retired colonel in the British army. Colonel Thomas 
came to Salt Lake City and stopped at the Templeton hotel, a small 
hotel in the Zion's Bank building at that time. His wife was taken sick, 
and as he sat there in his room and looked across the street to the old 
two-story adobe building that stood where the Hotel Utah now is, he 
saw a sign, "Mormon Publications." He read this sign "Mormon 
Publications," day after day, until it got on his nerves, and so he went 
over and bought some "Mormon Publications." When his wife re- 
covered, he returned to his home in London, and he read these publica- 
tions. He afterwards attended "Mormon" meetings and became con- 
vinced of the truth of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as again 
revealed to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith. He traveled 
all the way from the great city of London to Salt Lake City upon two 
separate and distinct occasions, for the privilege of going into the 
temple of the Lord, that stands on this block, and becoming a savior 
of his progenitors. As he was an educated man, and a man of im- 
portance, his friends thought that he had practically gone crazy, or he 
would not have joined the "miserable 'Mormons'." He received so many 
letters of inquiry, asking why he had joined the "Mormons," that he 
decided to write out his reasons for leaving the Church of England 
and joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He did 
so, and sent those reasons to the Liverpool office to Brother Rulon S. 
Wells, who was then president of the European mission, asking him to 
have a few hundred copies printed so that he could distribute them 
among his friends. Brother Wells asked permission to utilize, in the 
shape of a tract, the arguments and reasons that he gave for leaving 
the Church of England. This request was granted. Tens of thousands 
of copies of "My Reasons for Leaving the Church of England and 
joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" have been 
distributed in this country and in Europe, and I commend that very 
scholarly and splendid pamphlet to all Latter-day Saints who have not 
read it. I am sure I have, at least a half dozen times ; I have given away 
thousands of copies of this tract, and I want to bear witness here today, 
regarding this man — for I have met him and conversed with him — 
that he has the spirit of the gospel ; that he has in his heart a testimony 
of the divinity of the work in which you and I are engaged ; and it is 
the spirit that giveth life, that giveth understanding, that testifies of 
the things of God. This man is converted to the gospel. He is not only 
converted to the gospel, but he can give his reasons, scriptural reasons, 
in addition to the witness of the Spirit that he has received from the 
Lord as to the divinity of this work. Furthermore, he lives the gospel, 
and that is one of the great evidences of its divinity. 

DEMANDS UPON THE POCKET. 

It has been said that the tenderest part of the human anatomy, of 
the male variety of the species, is the pocket ; and I think there is little 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



25 



doubt of it, from my experience with mankind. The laws of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ are most exacting on the pockets of men, and our Church 
expects more from its members in this regard than any church upon the 
face of the earth. I remember reading of an incident where a man 
away up in northern Scandinavia, in that cold, hard country, where it is 
difficult to make a living, heard an elder proclaim the gospel of Jesus 
Christ again restored to the earth — faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and 
the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God. He 
received the witness in his heart to the truthfulness of this message, 
and he went down into the waters of baptism. He soon received 
the spirit of gathering, and he gathered from Scandinavia to Utah. 
After he had been here a little while the bishop called on him and 
said : "You do not pay any tithing." "Why, I never heard about tith- 
ing." And the bishop taught him the law of tithing, that one-tenth 
of all that he made belonged to the Church for the spread of the gos- 
pel and the building up of the work at home and abroad. This man 
was shocked at the outrageous "tax," of the Church, as he termed it, 
but he said : "The gospel is true, and' I guess I ought to live all the 
laws." After a great struggle he finally decided to comply with this 
law, and he honestly paid his tithing. The bishop later came to him 
and said : "You do not pay any fast-day donation to take care of the 
poor;" and the man said, "For the love of heaven, isn't ten per cent 
of all you make enough to take care of the poor?" "No," the bishop 
said ; "but we do not ask you to give a dollar. All we ask is that you 
fast, that you fail to partake of food for two meals once a month — 

. vou are not asked for any money, but simply to give to us the equiva- 
lent of what you save. You can consult your doctor, and you will 
find that this is beneficial to your health to fast for a couple of meals 
once a month." Well, he said, he did not know about that, but he 
finally concluded he ought to do his share for the poor, so he fasted, 
and in fasting he partook of the Spirit of the Lord that is given to 
us when we fast and pray to God ; and he rejoiced in paying his fast- 
day donation. Pretty soon the bishop came to him and said, "We 
need a new ward meetinghouse." "Well, let the Church build it — 
the tithing ought to be enough for that." The bishop said, "No, the 
Church will not build it, but the Church will give one dollar for 
each two dollars that we give. You know we need a new meeting- 
house, in- which to worship the Lord." He kicked and kicked hard, to 
use a slang phrase, but finally concluded that they needed a new 
meetinghouse, and he wanted to do his share. Next the bishop came 
around and said, "We need a- Church academy, so our children may 
not only be educated in the things of the world — the sciences, arts, 
literature and so on — but in the things of God ;" and he finally per- 

, suaded him to donate for an academy. Then he came and said to 
this man: "We need a stake meetinghouse." He complained again, 
but finally donated for a stake house. Then the bishop came around 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and said : "Here, brother, we are making- an extra effort to com- 
plete the Salt Lake temple, and we want a very large and splendid 
donation from you. You have been very prosperous ; the Lord has 
blessed you since you came to this land." Tie hemmed and hawed 
and complained, but he finally gave the donation, because in the mean- 
time he had learned this glorious principle of vicarious labor for the 
dead Some people ridicule that principle; thev say it is absurd, it 
is ridiculous that we, the living, can do work for the dead. People 
may ridicule this principle, but the very foundation of all Christianity 
is based upon the vicarious labor and the death of our Lord Jesus 
Christ for us. So this man finally contributed for the temple. The 
academy was soon completed, and his boy attended and in due time 
graduated with honor. Then the bishop called on him and said: 
"That boy of yours has graduated ; he has made a fine record, and 
we would like him to go on a mission to his father's native land. , It 
will cost you about $25 a month to send him and take care of him." 
To this the man replied: "Bishop, that is the straw that breaks the 
camel's back. I paid tithing ; I paid fast-day donations ; I paid for 
a ward house ; I paid for a stake house ; I paid for an academy ; I 
paid for the completion of the temple ; but if the Church wants my 
boy, whom I had expected to bring me in at least seventy-five dollars 
a month now that he has graduated, they will have to pay his ex- 
penses or he will not go on a mission." "Well," the bishop said, "that 
will be all right, he will not go, because the Church is not paying the 
expenses. All they will do for. him is to bring him home free of 
charge when his mission is completed. They will do that, they will 
bring him home again. That will be the limit." "Well, then," he 
said, "he will never go." The bishop said, "All right. Let us dis- 
miss the subject and talk on something else." They talked on for 
about an hour. The bishop went around and around, and finally he 
came to the native land of this man, the country from which he had 
come, as well as his relatives and friends. Then he said : "By the way,- 
whom do you love more than anybody else on the earth, except your 
own flesh and blood, your own family?" "Why," he said, "Bishop, 
more than any other person that draws the breath of life I love the 
man who came to me, away up in the midnight-sun country of Scan- 
dinavia, and brought to me the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
man who came there with' the Spirit of the living God, who touched 
my heart, and melted my very soul, and implanted in my being a 
knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the true and the living God ; I love him beyond my 
power to tell." The bishop then said, "Wouldn't you like somebody 
to love that boy of yours just as you love that elder," "Bishop," he 
said, "You have conquered me fair and square. The boy can go. I will 
pay his expenses." 

AN ARMY OF MISSIONARIES. 

Love of God and love of our fellow men — the first great ~om- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



27 



ivand, the Savior said, the first great law is to love the Lord our God 
with all our heart, with all our might, mind and strength ; and the 
second is like unto it, to love our neighbor as ourselves. I want to 
bear witness to all the world that no other people upon the face of the 
earth can show such love of God and such love of their fellow men as 
do the Latter-day Saints. We have about 2,000 missionaries, on an 
average, out in the world preaching the gospel, without money, with- 
out price, without being sustained except from their own pockets 
or the pockets of their relatives — for what? Because of their love 
of God, and because of their love of their fellows, to deliver the mes- 
sage to all the world that God has again opened the heavens ; that 
he has spoken from on high ; that he has sent his messengers ; that 
they have laid their hands upon the servants of God in this dav, and 
restored again to the earth the authority of the Priesthood of the liv- 
ing God, and the power to build up the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ upon the earth. 

We have recorded here in the back of this book, the little Pearl 
of Great Price, the Articles of Faith of the Latter-day Saints. 

"We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus 
- Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." 

BELIEF IN A PERSONAL GOD. 

We believe absolutely in God our Father. I remember reading, 
while I was in England, a book entitled, "The Young Man and the 
World." In that book, written by Senator Albert J. Beveridge, there 
was one chapter on "The Young Man and the Pulpit." In his book, 
Mr. Beveridge says that any man who enters the pulpit to preach, if 
he is not converted in his heart of hearts to the truth of that which 
he preaches, commits a sacrilege every time that he stands up in his 
pulpit. Then he said: "A certain man, with good opportunities for 
getting correct answers, during an entire summer vacation asked 
tnree questions of all the ministers with whom he came in contact. 
The first question was : "Do yofi believe in God, the Father — God a 
person. God a definite and tangible intelligence — 'not a congeries of 
laws floating like a fog through the universe — but God a person in 
whose image you were made? Don't argue; don't explain; but is 
your mind in a condition where you can answer yes or no?" Not a 
minister answered "Yes." I wish to say that there is not a boy, there 
is not a girl, in the intermediate classes of the Sunday schools of the 
Latter-day Saints, nor is there a man or a woman in all the Church 
of Jesus Christ, who would not answer "Yes" to that question. We 
believe that we are the children of the living God, and that he is in 
very deed an exalted person. Why? Because the Lord God Al- 
mighty, nearly a hundred years ago, appeared to a little boy 14 years 
• of age, and spoke to him. This boy saw that God our Father is a 
glorified man, so to speak; and he pointed to his Son, the Lord Jesus' 
Christ, and said to this little boy: "This is my beloved Son, hear 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



him." In answer to a simple question from that boy, as to which of all 
these denominations of the world he' should join, the Savior told 
him to join none of them, because they had all gone astray; and later 
he was called to be the instrument in the hands of God of restoring 
again the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. 

The next question in Senator Beveridge's book was : "Yes or no, 
do you believe that Christ was the Son of the Living God, sent by 
Him to save the World? I am not asking whether you believe that 
he was inspired in the sense that the great moral teachers are inspired 
— nobody has any difficulty about that ; but do you believe that Christ 
was God's very Son, with a divinely appointed and definite mission, 
dying on the cross and raised from the dead — yes or no?" Not a 
minister answered, "Yes." They went on to explain that he was a 
great moral teacher. Permit me to deny the fact that he was a 
great moral teacher, unless he was the Son of God. He himself an- 
nounced that he was the Savior of the world, that he was the Only Be- 
gotten of the Father in the flesh, that he was the Son of God; and 
therefore, if he was not the Son of God, he could not have been a 
great moral teacher, because the foundation of his mission was that 
he was God's Only Begotten Son. If he was not God's Son, he could 
not be a great moral teacher, because his foundation would be a false- 
hood. 

The next question was : "Do you believe that when you die you 
will live again as a conscious intelligence, knowing who you are 
and who other people are? Answer yes or no." Not one of them 
answered "Yes." 

Every man and every woman married in the temple on this block, 
or in any of the temples of God, are married for time and for all 
eternity. We believe that the marriage covenant is an eternal covenant, 
and there is not a Latter-day Saint living who does not expect to have 
his or her conscious identity beyond the grave. Thank God for the 
first article of our faith and our absolute knowledge, of God and 
of Jesus Christ. 

"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and 
not for Adam's transgression." I shall not comment on that. 

"We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind 
may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel." 

■ We find the following in a revelation from the Lord to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us. 

That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness; 

That through him all might be saved whom the Father has put into 
his power, and made by him. 

Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, ex- 
cept those sons of perdition, who 'deny the Son after the Father hath re- 
vealed him; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



29 



And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony last of all, which we give of him, that he lives; 

For we saw him, even on the right hand of God, end we heard the 
voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

That by him and through him, and o: him the worlds are and were cre- 
ated, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God. 

FIRST PRINCIPLES AND AUTHORITY. 

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are: 
First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third, baptism by 
immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, laying on of hands for the gifl 
of the Holy Ghost. 

We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy,. and by the 
laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the gospel and 
administer in the ordinances thereof. 

I want to say to you that all. those missionaries who have gone 
out to preach the gospel — and we have had at least 80,000 of them, 
from the day the Church was first organized — have had laid upon 
their heads, the hands of God's authorized servants, men who held 
his authority; and all over the wide world, in every land and in every 
clime, from the midnight-sun country of the north to South Africa, 
wherever they have gone, the Spirit of the living God has attended 
them. From every land and from every clime men and women have 
received the witness of the Holy Spirit, and have embraced the gos- 
pel; and all the wisdom of all the world, the wisdom of all the 
churches, in all the world, has never yet been able to convert any Lat- 
ter-day Saint elder. They say we have not the truth; they say that 
we are deluded! How the Lord Almighty has neglected for nearly 
90 years, the honest, faithful, virtuous, upright Latter-day Saints, 
having failed to allow any of their missionaries, or of their converts in 
the world, to discover the error of this gospel as taught by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints ! Yet these men have gone forth after having had 
hands laid upon their heads, giving them authority as God's ambas- 
sadors to go and proclaim the truth, and from every denomination 
under heaven men and women have been converted to the gospel 
which some people regard as a delusion. 

BELIEF IN PROPHETS. 

"We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive 
church, viz; apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc." 

I shall not take your time further than to refer to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. We believe that he was a prophet of God, and we not 
only believe it but we know that he was. Why? He declared that 
he would be chosen, when he was a child, and he was chosen. He 
announced to the world that he would receive the Book of Mormon, 
and he did receive the Book of Mormon, which he translated from the 
plates', to which reference has been made. Eleven men, in addition to 
himself, bear witness that he had the plates. Eight of these men hand- 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



led them and saw the engravings, and the plates were shown to three 
of these men by an angel of God who came down from heaven. "Oh, 
but," says one, "I don't believe it," but if eleven honest, reputable 
men testified that a man had committed' murder, that man would hang 
all right or be shot. There is no one who can say that the statement 
of the witnesses regarding the Book of Mormon, is not true, and 
there are tens of thousands who can say, by the witness of the Spirit 
of God, that these things are true. Joseph Smith proclaimed that he 
would yet be a prophet, before he was one, and he was chosen. He 
predicted that the Latter-day Saints would be driven from city to 
city from county to county, from state to state, and finally driven from 
the confines of the United States to the Rocky Mountains, which was 
then Mexican territory. People laughed him to scorn for saying that 
he, whom they considered a miserable upstart, at the head of a de- 
luded lot of people, would attract the attention of anybody to the ex- 
tent that they would be driven out of a state, and particularly be driven 
beyond the confines of the United States. He also announced that the 
day would come when not only a city, not only a county, not only a 
state should be arrayed against the handful of Latter-day Saints, 
commonly called "Mormons," but the day should come when the 
whole United States would be arrayed against them. People hooted 
at that statement, but the day did come when we were driven from 
city to city, from county to county, and state to state, and the day 
did come when we were driven to the Rocky Mountains, where he 
had said we should become a great and mighty people. And that is 
exactly what we have become, because in proportion to our numbers 
we are a great and mighty people, and people are beginning to recog- 
nize it today. Finally the United States of America, on the state- 
ments of lying judges and others sent an army against us — for doing 
what? For doing what we never did, but subsequently the govern- 
ment pardoned us for our sins that we had never committed, but they 
sent their army here all the same. And later, because of false state- 
ments made to Congress, the government confiscated all the property, 
both real and personal, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, as if the Lord desired doubly to fulfil the pre- 
diction of Joseph Smith. I picked up the paper day after day myself, 
when the trial was going on here in the courts, and read in bold 
headlines, "The United States of America ys. the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints," and laid the paper down and said : 
"Thanks be to Uncle Sam for putting the absolute stamp of divinity 
upon the utterances of the Prophet Joseph Smith !" This is one of 
the reasons why we believe in prophets — because their prophecies are 
fulfilled. It is only fair to say that this property was afterwards re- 
stored to the Church by acts of Congress. 

EVANGELICAL INSPIRATION. 

"We believe in pastors, teachers, evangelists"- — 

There is no need of believing in an evangelist unless he has the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



31 



evangelical inspiration of his office. I want to say to you that when 
I was a baby my mother took me to the patriarch, or the evangelist, 
Brother Perkins, who afterwards moved to St. George and located 
there, and that patriarch put his hands upon my head and bestowed 
upon me a little blessing that would perhaps be about one-third of a 
typewritten page. That blessing foretold my life to the present 
moment. The promises made to that baby have been fulfilled. I went 
to Tooele as a hoy not twenty-four years of age, to preside over that 
stake of Zion. I was without experience, and I felt mightily my weak- 
ness. Soon after I arrived there with my wife and two little babies, 
my youngest baby was taken very sick and came nigh to death's door. 
I did not know one single solitary soul in Tooele City when I went 
out there except John Rowberry and Francis M. Lyman. Brother 
Lyman lived next door to me, but he was not at home. Knowing that 
my little baby was in a dying condition, I sent for my friend, John 
Rowberry, the patriarch, the evangelist in that stake of Zion, asking 
him to come and assist me in blessing the baby. After blessing the 
little one he said : "Brother Grant, looking at it naturally, your baby 
is going to die." I said, "I have no doubt of it, unless the Lord 
hears and answers our prayers." He said, "Well, the Lord is going 
to hear and answer them. Go and get a table and a piece of paper, 
and sit down by the bed ; I want to give this baby its partiarchal 
blessing." He laid his hands upon that baby and promised her that 
she should live ; that she should grow to womanhood ; that she ..should 
marry a servant of the living God ; that she should become a mother in 
Israel ; that she should become a leader among the sisters in the Church. 
A year or so ago, President Joseph F. Smith handed' me the list of 
Church authorities to present to the people, as he quite frequently 
did. I read the names and presented them, and when I came to the 
last name, as one of the General Board of the Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Association, I had to read that name through tears of 
gratitude, because I was presenting the name of my daughter, who, I 
believe, but for the power of God, would have died when a baby — I was 
presenting her name to be one of those to preside among her sisters, 
over thirty or forty-odd thousand of the young women in the Young 
Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association. 

Why do we believe in evangelists? Because they have the in- 
spiration of God, the inspiration of their office and they are able to 
foretell the lives of the men and women upon whom they place their 
hands. While in Tooele, I received a patriarchal blessing myself from 
this same man, John Rowberry, and he promised me that I should be 
taken from that stake of Zion and become a leader in the Church of 
Christ ; and I stand here today a witness of the inspiration of God to 
that man, John Rowberry. Not only did he promise me that, but 
many other things, all of which have been fulfilled. 

THE GIFTS PROMISED, AND BESTOWED.

tongues. When I was a little child, in a Relief society meeting held 
in the home of the late William C. Staines, corner South Temple and 
Fifth East streets, my mother was there, "Aunt Em" Wells was there, 
Eliza R. Snow, Zina D. Young, and many others. After the meeting 
was over Sister Eliza R. Snow, by the gift of tongues, gave a bless- 
ing to each and everyone of those good sisters, and Sister Zina D. 
Young gave the interpretation. After blessing those sisters, she turned- 
to the boy playing on the floor, and pronounced a blessing upon my 
head by the gift of tongues, and Zina D. Young gav.e the interpretation. 
I of course did not understand one word that Aunt Eliza was saying. 
I was astonished because she was talking to me and pointing at me. 
I could not understand a word, and all I got of the interpretation, as 
a child, was that some day I should be a big man. I thought it meant 
that I would grow tall. My mother made a record of that blessing. 
What was it? It was a prophecy, by the gift of tongues, that her boy 
should live to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and ofttimes 
she told me that if I would behave myself, that honor would come to 
me. I always laughed at her and said : "Every mother believes that 
her son will become president of the United States, or hold some 
great office. You ought to get that out of your head, Mother." I did 
not believe her until that honor came to me. Tell me that the gift 
of tongues is not exercised in this Church? As well tell me that I 
do not know that I stand here today. Subsequently my own wife, the 
mother, of the haby to which I have referred, upon one occasion when 
I came home at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, having been working 
early and late trying to meet the interest on my obligations, read me a 
lecture about breaking the Word of Wisdom. She said to me : "You'd 
better drink tea or coffee, or even use tobacco, rather than sit up 
all night working. You are breaking the Word of Wisdom." Finally 
she stopped suddenly, and by the gift of tongues she made a predic- 
tion and several wonderful promises, among others that I should live 
to pay all my obligations. This was at a time when my friends were 
begging me to take the bankruptcy act. Among other things she prom- 
ised that I should live to lift up my voice in many lands and in many 
climes, proclaiming the gospel. Since then I have lifted up my voice 
in the Hawaiian Islands, in Japan, in Great Britain, Belgium, Hol- 
land, the three Scandinavian countries, in Canada, in Mexico, and in- 
almost every state in the Union of the United States, proclaiming that 
I know that God lives, proclaiming that I know that Jesus is the Christ, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God. I have 
done this in fulfilment of a promise made on my head by my wife, 
whose body now lies in the tomb, who made this promise years before 
it came to pass. I will not take up further time on that article of our 
faith.

we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things per- 
taining to the kingdom of God. 

We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the 
Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent; 
that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and that the earth will be 
renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory. 

We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the 
dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let 
them worship how, where or what they may. 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, 
in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law. 

Yet some people write that we are in rebellion against the United 
States ; that we would like to set up a republic of our own ; that we are 
a great financial combine of people who are arranging to eventually 
conquer our country. Our boys who gave their lives in France ; our 
boys who went forth in far greater number than the government had 
requested/ according to our population; our money so freely given for 
Liberty and Victory bonds; our declaration to all the world, through 
. the Prophet Joseph Smith, that the men who wrote the Constitution 
of this country were inspired of the living God — all of these things 
give the lie to all the liars who are perpetually saying that we are op- 
posed to this country. When the Latter-day Saints were being driven 
from their homes, when they were coming to these Rocky mountains 
in fulfilment of the prediction of Joseph Smith — they were being 
expatriated ; they were driven from the confines of the United States, 
and were coming to Mexican soil. Our country was then in trouble 
with Mexico, and the government called on Brigham Young for 500 
men to help fight Mexico. To this call President Young replied : 
'You shall have your men, and if we have not enough men we will 
furnish you women ;" and within three days the men were ready. 
That Mormon Battalion went to California and discovered gold. Show 
to me, if you can, in all the history of the world another case of a peo- 
ple being expatriated, being driven from their own country, from their 
own lands which they had purchased, being driven out from a beau- 
tiful city, the last remnant of them crossing the Mississippi river in the 
dead of winter, on the ice, nine babies being born during the night of 
that terrible expulsion, with no shelter but their mother's breasts, 
going forth on their journey of a thousand miles in the wilderness, 
after having appealed to the president of their republic, who could only 
say: "Your cause is just, but we can do nothing for you" — show me 
another people, I say, who under like circumstances would have fur- 
nished 500 men to fight their country's battles! Show me greater 
patriotism and loyalty to country than this ! It can't be done. Allow 
me to announce that from the day of Joseph Smith to this identical 
day, the leaders of this people have had absolute respect, love and rev- 
erence for their country. Allow me to announce further that we are 
patriotic Americans to the core, and. that we have learned it, many of 
us, at our mother's knees, where we said our prayers. We believe abso- 
lutely in the inspiration of God to the men who framed our Consti- 
tution.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



W_e believe in being Jionest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in 
doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition 
of Paul, We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many 
things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtu- 
ous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. 

JUDGED BY THEIR FRUITS. 

All we ask of the world is to remember the articles of faith of the 
Latter-day Saints and to judge the Latter-day Saints by their fruits. 
This was the standard that the Savior gave for a righteous judgment. 
What are the fruits of "Mormonism?" No people in these United 
States of America have higher financial credit than the "Mormons." 
No other people in these United States of America have as low a death 
rate as the "Mormons." Vileness and wickedness do not decrease the 
death rate. No people of the same number can produce as many fine 
singers — and fine singing does not go with corruption and wickedness. 
The Lord said in- a revelation to the wife of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
"For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart ; yea, the song of the 
righteous is a prayer unto me, and shall be answered with blessings up- 
on their heads." No people have a better reputation for fulfiling the 
first great commandment of God — "Multiply and replenish the earth." 
No race suicide in Utah ; that is, in the "Mormon" sections of Utah, or 
in the "-Mormon" communities of southern Idaho, or in Canada, or in 
Arizona, or Old Mexico. No people can make a finer record in failing 
to produce insane than the Latter-day Saints, and yet insanity gen- 
erally comes with wickedness. No people can produce fewer criminals 
than the Latter-day Saints. The governor of the state of Arizona 
remarked some time ago that we were being robbed of several hun- 
dred per cent of our taxes, because none of our people were in the 
insane asylum, and we were entitled to quite a number. He further 
said that we were being robbed of two or three thousand per cent of 
our taxes because we had only one inmate in the penitentiary, although 
we were entitled to twenty-five or thirty, according to our population. 
I referred to this statement when I was in Arizona a short time ago, 
and the district judge, who was sitting in the audience, jumped up and 
said: "Pardon me, Mr. Grant, but that one has since been pardoned." 
(Laughter.) 

I see I have talked much longer than I had intended. I rejoice in 
the witness of the Holy Spirit to me that I can stand up in all sobriety 
and testify to you that the angel of God, ninety-six years ago today, did 
appear to the boy Joseph Smith, and that the promises made to that boy 
have been fulfilled ; that he did become a prophet of God ; that he died a 
martyr to the truth ; that his blood testified, as the blood of all martyrs 
has done in ages past, to the divinity of the work that he has estab- 
lished ; and I bear to you my witness that God has given to me a knowl- 
edge that he lives ; that Jesus is the Savior of the world, and that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God. I pray for light and knowledge and power 
and ability that you and I, every one of us who have received this testi- 
mony, may so order our lives that all men, seeing our sobriety, seeing 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 35 

i 

the uprightness of our lives, may be led to investigate the fruits of the 
gospel of Christ, and that they, too, may receive the witness of the 
Holy Spirit. This is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 

It is a pleasant sight to look upon so many Latter-day Saints 
who have come to our conference to join in the worship of God and 
to hear our leaders speak to us, to encourage us, to strengthen us in 
our faith, and to help us in our resolves to serve God. I look upon 
this movement of coming to conferences as a great help in uniting 
the Latter-day Saints both in faith and in love. 

VALUE OF CONFERENCE GATHERINGS AND SACRAMENT MEETINGS. 

The people of God formerly were commanded to go to the 
temple once or twice a year. They felt it a duty to make up their 
companies and travel to Jerusalem to attend the services in the temple 
of God. As long as this custom- continued, Israel was united, but 
when this was abandoned, idolatry took place of the true worship. 
The. Ten Tribes rebelled against Rehoboam who was left as king of 
the tribes of Judah and Benjamin only, Jeroboam saw that as long, 
as his people should continue to go to Jerusalem to the temple, there 
would be a union with the people living there, and their faith would 
be kept up, therefore he built places of worship on the hills, tried to 
lead the people astray, and did this to a great extent. One way in 
which he accomplished this was to prevent the annual gathering of the 
people of God at Jerusalem. 

We come here from many different places. I have already met 
this week people from Mexico on the south and Canada on the north, 
from California, from the East, and from up and down our State and 
Idaho, who have come here to attend conference. They meet with 
friends and old acquaintances and friendships are renewed. They 
attend the meetings of the conference and hear what the servants of 
the Lord have to give unto them. 

We have this morning heard from our President. He has used 
the vehicle of hymns to bring to us some great truths, encouraging 
and inspiring us, and his teaching has been accepted by us all. We 
feel that he has been inspired by the Lord in speaking to us, and that 
he is inspired in the duties and labors that devolve upon him. I be- 
lieve that we as a people ought to remember the words he has spoken, 
and carry them out in our daily lives. 

Our meetings at conferences here, and our quarterly confer- 
ences, all tend to unite the Latter-day Saints. I could not ask the peo- 
ple to attend our general conferences in greater numbers than they do, 
as we are not able to give them all a chance to come into our taber- 
nacle and other buildings where we gather at our general conferences. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I would like to ask the Latter-day Saints to be more punctual in at- 
tending their quarterly conferences both Saturdays and Sundays. 
Generally some of the Twelve, or of the Council of Seventy, or other 
leading men, are sent out to the stakes to attend the Stake Confer- 
ences. These ought to be attended well by the people. Those who 
attend will thus come in touch with the central government of the 
Church ; they will learn what is wanted, and they will be built up in 
their faith and strengthened to perform their duties. We love to see 
the Saints come together, not only in their conferences, but also in their 
sacrament meetings, their quorum meetings and different meetings 
of the organizations that are helps in the government of the Church. 
We would like to see the people zealous in performing this duty. 

DUTY OF THE SAINTS IN MEETING. 

When we come together and someone is called to speak unto 
us, let us sustain him with our prayers, pray in our hearts that the 
Lord will lead him to speak unto us such things as shall be for our 
best good, and if we do this, our prayers will be answered. The 
speaker will be led to speak upon such things as are needed by those 
who have assembled. Our brethren very seldom write out their ser- 
mons before they go to meeting, except in cases where they are asked 
to speak on a certain, subject. That does not mean that they do 
as the man to whom Bro. N. L. Nelson refers in his work on preach- 
ing, as quoted by our President. The Lord wants us to fill our minds 
with useful knowledge and then ask him to lead us in what we shall 
speak. By following this course the Lord will bring forth unto us 
that which he wants us to give unto the hearers. When the speaker 
sits down, show that you have been attentive to what has been 
said by saying "Amen" in your usual pitch of voice, as much as to say, 
"yes, those words will be treasured by me." We did that formerly 
more than we do now. We used to give our "Amen" so that all 
could hear it, but today we are too quiet in the matter. Let us show 
our sympathy with and our assent to what has been said, by giving 
a good audible' "Amen" at the close of the discourse. 

THE INSPIRATION OF JOSEPH THE PROPHET. 

I will read a verse or two from one of the early revelations. I 
have always loved to read those revelations given to the Prophet in the 
early days, because they prove their intrinsic truth, as he could not 
have seen the future except by the power of >God. In 1828, when the 
Prophet was a few months past twenty-two years old, he received a 
revelation, in which we find these words : 

For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do 
many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at nought 
the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and 
carnal desires, he must fail and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him. 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 



37 



I call your attention to this revelation given almost two years 
before the organization of the Church, before the Prophet had had any 
experience in Church government, and in the various ways in which 
men's minds act. 

When it says, "although he may have many revelations," most 
anyone would wonder how a person having had a revelation could 
ever fall away? We would so think to ourselves, and the young 
man Joseph, if it had been his own invention, would not have thought 
of putting this paragraph in the revelation. But this he received 
from on high, and it shows that the Giver understood mankind and 
understood how fickle their minds often are. Oliver Cowdery, the 
second elder in the Church, was writing for Joseph when they were 
translating the Book of Mormon. In doing so they came to a passage 
about baptism and they asked the Lord concerning that ordinance. 
John the Baptist, who held the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood in 
the days of the Savior, was sent to them, and he ordained them to 
the Aaronic Priesthood. He bestowed upon them the authority to 
administer baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and he 
taught them how they should be baptized. Oliver and Joseph baptized 
each other according to the instructions given by the angel. Now, 
Oliver Cowdery saw the angel, he felt his hands upon his head, he 
knew the ordination he received was from God. At Harmony he 
was helping the Prophet as his scribe ; and once, as they were traveling 
close to the Susquehanna river, tired out and persecuted, Peter, James 
and John appeared to them and bestowed upon them the apostolic 
power of the Priesthood. This was a great comfort to them. They 
had now the Melchizedek Priesthood as well as the Aaronic, and they 
were authorized not only to baptize but to confirm members in the 
Church and bestow upon them the Holy Ghost. They themselves re- 
ceived this and they were authorized to so administer to others. 

The Church was not yet organized ; a few were baptized ; but on 
the sixth of April, 1830,- the Church was organized, we generally say, 
with six members. There were more, but it took six members to in- 
corporate. Then the Lord told Joseph and Oliver that they were to 
be ordained elders. They held the Melchizedek Priesthood, but there 
were no offices then established in the Priesthood. When the offices 
were instituted Joseph and Oliver were sustained by the people in 
the office of elders, and the Church was directed by elders for about 
fourteen months, and then the first high priests were ordained. It is 
remarkable, when you read the revelation concerning the government 
of the Church, given at the same time the Church was organized, to 
see that it contains really the law of the Church, and this has not been 
changed, because it was given by Him who understood the conditions 
and needs of his children and of his Church. In the revelation, in- 
structions were given both about the organization, about the duties of 
the different officers in the Church, and of the members.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THE APOSTASY, TESTIMONY, AND RETURN OF OLIVER COWDERY. 

When we think of Oliver Cowdery. having received revelations 
— not one but several — he had been with Joseph, he had been under 
that holy influence when Joseph was translating the Book of Mormon 
and, as he himself describes afterward, felt a heavenly feeling per- 
vade his soul, as he sat under the voice of the Prophet and wrote down 
what the Prophet translated. And yet, with all this, a time came when 
the mind of Oliver became dark. He fell into transgression and was 
cut off from the Church. It shows the justice of the Prophet and those 
in the council, since, although he held such a high place in the Church 
he was not treated in a different manner from the lay members of the 
Church. But during the time that he was in a state of excommunica- 
tion he did not deny the testimony to which his name is attached in the 
Book of Mormon. Those things he had seen. 

It has been told of his being in a court (he was a lawyer and was 
conducting a case) and that his opponent thought he would gain influ- 
ence over the jury and the people there by letting them know that 
Oliver Cowdery had signed the testimony of the Three Witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon. That did not keep Oliver from speaking the 
truth. He arose and bore his testimony in that courtroom to all pres- 
ent, stating that what he had signed there was the truth, because he 
had seen with his eyes an angel, that he had seen the plates, and that 
he knew what he had signed was true. 

After a while, when the Church had reached its lowest point, al- 
most, the Saints had been driven out of their possessions, had gone into 
the wilderness, the world thought there could be no more power in the 
"Mormon' Church, it had sung its last verse. But not so. The Saints 
were under the Lord's overruling providence. They were directed to 
a place where they could worship him according to his dictates and de- 
sires. At that time Oliver Cowdery came to the Church at Council 
Bluffs. Elder Orson Hyde, a man whom he had been the means' of 
converting, was presiding there. The Council was called together, 
and Oliver had to be accepted like every other person who has been 
cut off from the Church. The people accepted his humble plea to come 
back into the Church. He said, "I do not ask for office, I just want 
to get within the pale of the Church." He also bore a strong testimony 
of its truth. It was not the hope of promotion or wealth, because the 
Church did not look like it would ever have any means, or that the 
Church would ever have any honor to bestow on people in the Church, 
but he knew that it was the Church of Christ. His conscience smote 
him ; he felt that he did not want to die outside the Church, and he was 
received back again. He went down to the home of his brother-in-law, 
David Whitmer, in Missouri, and died there some five or six months 
afterward. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



39 



ALL THE WITNESSES PROVED TRUE TO THEIR TESTIMONY. 

The same can be said of all the Three Witnesses of the Book of 
Mormon, that though they had received many revelations still they did 
leave the Church, but they never denied their testimonies of the truth 
of the Book of Mormon. David Whitmer never returned to the 
Church, but always bore a faithful testimony to the truth of the Book 
of Mormon. Martin Harris came back to the Church and on his death- 
bed he bore a strong testimony of what he had seen. 

IN REGARD TO CONVERSIONS BY MIRACLES, AND BY THE POWER OF THE 

SPIRIT. 

And in regard to miracles, persons having come into the Church 
by seeing extraordinary healings, or by seeing signs, knowing that they 
belonged to the Church of Christ, yet after witnessing such things some 
have left the Church. One of the first apostates came into the Church 
by seeing a wonderful healing, but if that was the only reason for his 
joining, it would have taken miracles every day, nearly, to have kept 
him there ; he apostatized and left the Church. Those of us, brethren 
and sisters, who have joined the Church, and have had the Spirit of 
God conferred upon us by the laying on of hands, and have received the 
assurance that we have the truth, and that in going down into the 
waters of baptism we fulfilled the Lord's command to us, without hav- 
ing seen miracles, are just as strong in our testimony as those who 
have had ocular manifestations, because what you see with your eyes 
and hear with your ears is brought to the spirit through the different 
channels of your bodily senses, while those who receive a testimony 
through the Spirit of the Lord acting upon their spirits receive as 
strong a conviction of the truth as those who get it through their 
bodily senses. 

How many of you who have received the testimony through the 
Spirit could become convinced that you are mistaken? You feel that the 
Lord has given you a knowledge for yourself ; you know that this is 
the work of the Lord ; you know that the Savior lives ; you know 
that Joseph Smith was an inspired prophet of God, and as long as you 
perform your duty, and hold yourselves near to the Lord in prayer, 
that testimony cannot be taken from you. But if we neglect our duties, 
if we do things contrary to the will of the Lord, we can become dark. 
We can see in this hall at night when it is lighted up, but going out 
where it is dark we may remember what we have seen in the lighted 
hall, remember the light that lightened it ; but outside, when we go 
into the land of the enemy, we cannot see our way, and w£ may even 
kick against the pricks ; we may do that which we once knew to be 
wrong. Hence, let none ot us forget how precious is the testimony of 
the Holy Spirit, to know that God lives, that his Son lives, and that 
his Son is coming again and will restore his kingdom upon the ea^th.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THE DUTY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO THE WORLD. 

r 

The time is hastening, the end of the sixth millennium is neer. 
The seventh millennium, it has been predicted, will be a reign of a thou- 
sand years of peace, then Christ will reign, then the work for the 
salvation of the human family, from the time of Adam down to the 
present, will be remembered, and all things both in heaven and on the 
earth will be gathered together in one and delivered over to Christ. 
What a happy time it will be, when peace shall reign on earth, when 
men will accept the word of the Lord ! Satan will be bound, and will 
not be able to stir up men to war against one another, nor against 
God. What a beautiful picture is spread before us when we contem- 
plate this happy time! Let us, brethren and sisters, remember the 
covenants we have made with the Lord, let us work faithfully to per- 
form our duties and remember the great duty that rests upon us to 
spread the light to the world. 

CONDITIONS IN MISSION FIELDS. 

» ■ 

Just now we are prevented from sending elders, like we used to 
do, into different European- countries and to "the islands of the sea 
that are under the English government. They have been kind enough, 
however, to allow a few of our elders to go there. But we cannot 
send them as we formerly did when we have the elders ready to go. 
But our adversary -will not be able to stop this work; it is not in his 
power. If our elders cannot go from Zion, we will have elders over 
there who will be inspired of the Lord to guide those who join the 
Church, and to bear testimony to the outsiders and bring many into ihe 
Church. I was pleased to hear Brother Richards, upon his return from 
England, tell us that when they did not have elders enough from Zion 
to place in charge of the conferences, they would take local elders, 
and they found even young men who really showed that they had abil- 
ity to become splendid presidents of conferences. The people listened 
to them and accepted them as the servants of the Lord, and the work 
was not stopped. The same was true in Scandinavia. We have had to 
use local elders over there to a great extent, yet the work is going on. 
The Saints feel more united. They long, of course, for the elders from 
here to come as they used to, but as they cannot have them, they are 
able to take hold of the work themselves and to carry it on. 

We had a letter from Liege, Belgium, the other day, which informs 
us that when the Germans moved into that city they took all the halls 
belonging to the city and installed their soldiers. Our elders were 
counseled to go over to England, and the Saints were left to them- 
selves and could not hold meetings. But it was not long before some 
of the Saints opened their doors, and they could meet to hold Sunday 
School and meetings in private homes, until at last they got their hall 
back, and then the branch at Seraing joined the branch at Liege, and 
together they met both in Sunday School and sacrament meetings. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



41 



But they did not have elders or priests to administer the sacrament, 
so an elder visited them once a month, and he blessed their children 
and confirmed those who had joined the Church. For in that branch 
there were fourteen who joined the Church; and this elder performed 
this work until at last someone could be sent to labor there. So you 
see that the Lord can overrule for good whatever happens, and bless 
the Saints, and instil in their hearts a love for the truth that cannot be 
taken from them. During the time that they were alone they remem- 
bered their tithing, and sent it every month to Rotterdam, to the Pres- 
ident of the Netherlands Mission, and they also gathered nearly four 
thousand francs for their poor. They were all poor, too, but they re- 
membered some who were worse off than they were, thus showing 
their love both for the Church and for their brethren and sisters. 

I understand that although our elders were withdrawn from Ger- 
many, branches have continued to prosper. The President of the 
Swiss and German Mission has not been able to get into the German 
part of the Mission until the present time. I believe he is traveling 
there now, the Trustee-in-Trust having .authorized him to ascertain 
how much means is needed to help our poor Saints who are in distress. 
I think he got permission to visit the different branches ; but during the 
time that the Saints have been isolated, they have continued to pay their 
tithes and offerings, and to meet together to edify one another. 

THE VITALITY OF "MORMONISM." 

So you see and realize the "Vitality of 'Mormonism' " in this, as 
Brother Talmage has written about so clearly. It does exist, and our 
enemies can not stop this work. It is of God, it will gain the victory ; 
and it will grow, as the President said, until it shall fill the whole earth. 
That is the destiny of the work in which we are engaged. God bless us 
all. Amen. 

Louisa Watson sang a solo : "Fear not ye, O Israel." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of regret to all of us, I believe, to learn from the 
despatches, received this morning, that the President of the United 
States is in a very critical condition of health. I wish to say that I 
was profoundly impressed with all that he said from this stand, during 
his recent visit, and that it met with my hearty approval. I had the 
pleasure of meeting him at the hotel, and I was impressed with the 
honesty and sincerity of his motives. I believe that he desires, with all 
the power of his being, to accomplish that which, in his estimation, is 
for the good of mankind the world over. 

After the singing of the Doxology, by the congregation, we will ask 
that you all join Elder Orson F. Whitney in the benediction, and pray 
for the recovery of the health of our President of these United States.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The choir and congregation sang the Doxology : 

Praise God from whom all blessings flow; 
Praise Him, all creatures here below; 
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host, 
Praise Father, Sop and Holy Ghost. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Orson F. Whitney, of the 
Council of the Twelve Apostles : 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, — the Author of our being 
and the Giver of all that we enjoy, the Source of all power and the 
Father of the spirits of all men, — we desire to render gratitude and 
praise unto thee at this time for the words of inspiration that have 
been spoken from this stand at the opening of our general conference. 
We pray thee to sanctify them to our good, and to strengthen and in- 
spire us to go forth with a renewed determination to serve thee and to 
keep thy commandments, to promote thy cause and, with all the power 
that we possess, reinforced by thy power resting upon us, to build up 
the Church and Kingdom of God. We dedicate this servivce unto thee 
and ask thee to hearken unto our petition. 

We pray especially, our Father, for the President of the United 
States, thy servant who so recently addressed us from this stand, and 
with whose remarks and sentiments and the truths that he uttered our 
hearts were so powerfully impressed and our minds illumined. We de- 
sire, with all our hearts, that his life may be spared, that thou wilt 
deliver him from the sickness that now afflicts him, that thou wilt re- 
buke the destroyer in his behalf and raise him up to continue the mighty 
work unto which thou hast called him. We pray thee, O God, to 
touch him with a healing touch, to let the peace and light and power of 
the Holy Spirit rest upon him. Give him the faith to be healed. Bless 
those about him with faith and with the full command of all their 
knowledge and skill and judgment and wisdom, that they may render to 
him the assistance of which he stands in need; and all that is done for 
him, may it have thy blessing upon it to this end, that he may be spared 
to continue the work which thou hast given him to do. 

We pray for all the leaders of the Nation. We pray for our Coun- 
try. We pray for the cause of right and truth and freedom, that it 
may prevail ; that thy Kingdom may come and thy will be done on earth 
as it is done in heaven. 

We ask these blessings and invoke thy blessing in dismissal, in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 



43 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays; 
We thank Thee for every blessing " 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command. 

When dark clouds of trouble hang o'er us 

And threaten our peace to destroy, 
There is hope smiling brightly before us, 

And we know that deliverance is nigh; 
We doubt not the Lord nor His goodness, 

We've proved Him in days that are past; 
The wicked who fight against Zion 

Will surely be smitten at last. 

We'll sing of His goodness and mercy, 

We'll praise Him by day and by night. 
Rejoice in His glorious Gospel, 

And bask in its life-giving light; 
Thus on to eternal perfection 

The honest and faithful will go, 
While they who reject this glad message 

Shall never such happiness know. 

Elder William Lennox Adamson, President of the Blaine stake 
of Zion, offered prayer. 

The choir and congregation sang : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 

Guide us to the promised land, 
We are weak, but Thou art able — • 

Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 
Holy Spirit, 

Feed us till the Savior comes. 

Open, Jesus, Zion's fountains, 

Let her richest blessings come, 
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar 

Guard us to this holy home. 
Great Redeemer, 

Bring, O bring the welcome day! 

When the earth begins to tremble, 

Bid our fearful thoughts be still; 
When Thy judgments spread destruction, 

Keep us safe on Zion's hill. 
Singing praises, 
Songs of glory unto Thee.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It has fallen to my lot, from the time that I became one of the 
general authorities, to come in close business relations with many in- 
fluential people, both on the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts, as well as 
in the cities between. When I was a small boy, about twelve years of 
age, Col. Alex. G. Hawes, the Western Manager of the New York 
Life Insurance Company, came to board at my mother's home. He 
subsequently returned with his bride, and his first child was born in 
our house. He became, without any exception, the dearest and best 
friend that I had in all the world, aside from my own people, and my 
association with him, I believe, was as intimate as it was 
possible to have with any man. He treated me almost like a father ; 
and in the panic of 1893, hearing that I might fail in busi- 
ness, he wrote and told me he had arranged to mortgage his home, 
to get money to assist me. He had tried at every commercial bank 
in the city where he lived to borrow money on first class collateral se- 
curity, to send me ; none of tRem were making loans. "But," he said, 
"the savings banks are loaning; they loan only on real estate, and I 
have no real estate except the home in which I live. I have arranged 
for a loan on my home, and if it will save your financial life, do not 
write, but telegraph immediately upon receipt of this letter, and 
I will transfer the money to you by wire, as delays are dangerous." 

I could not hold back the tears of gratitude that filled my eyes, 
to think that a man of the world would make such an offer as this to 
me in my time of distress. He subsequently secured for me the agency 
for Utah of the great company with which he was connected, and for 
one year I was their representative in connection with my associates 
in this city. At that time a gentleman by the name of Darwin P. Kings- 
ley was the superintendent of agencies, and subsequently became the 
president of that company. The day before yesterday I received a very 
beautifully bound volume of some four hundred pages, containing 
speeches made by himself mainly upon this great question of peace, and 
questions connected with the war. I have read with intense interest 
something over one hundred and fifty pages of these speeches, since 
the book arrived, and they strike a very responsive chord in my under- 
standing of the situation. I remarked here this morning that, like 
the congressman, I was going to ask permission to reprint my speech 
of two weeks ago. I am going to do the same here again this after- 
noon, and shall have printed in tomorrow night's News one of Presi- 
dent Darwin P. Kingsley's speeches on the League of Nations, con- 
taining also a splendid tribute to President Wilson. We will now be ad- 
dressed by President Charles W. Penrose. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 45 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I feel very grateful for the privilege of attending this conference ; 
also for the opportunity of speaking for a short time to this vast con- 
greation. Although I am not altogether unaccustomed to public 
speaking, but have had some experiences at home and abroad in this 
direction, I approach the task imposed upon me this afternoon with 
some timidity. 

GRATITUDE FOR THE RESTORED GOSPEL. 

I feel keenly the need of the spirit of my office and calling to qual- 
ify me for saying anything today, after the splendid utterances that 
were delivered from this stand during the morning, and I hope 
that I shall have your attention and your faith and help while I stand 
here occupying this position. The Lord has been very merciful and 
kind to me since I embraced the gospel, restored in the latter days, 
when I was but a boy, and through all my travels and labors and 
struggles he has been with me by trie power of his Spirit, and in the 
public congregation, this afternoon, I express to him, although in feeble 
language, the gratitude of my soul, the desires of my heart that I shall 
be able to continue in this splendid work in which we are all engaged 
as long as I live in the flesh, and then be able to carry on the work 
when I pass beyond the veil, and come into the society of the great 
men and women with whom I have been associated in years that are 
past, in the same mighty cause. It is the cause of God and of hu- 
manity, his children, for it involves the happiness and salvation of 
many millions, and the exaltation of those among them who received 
the gospel in the flesh, or afterwards received it in its fulness, and 
prepared themselves thereby to associate with the good and the true 
and the best of mankind. 

Ever since I heard the gospel of Jesus Christ as restored in these 
last days, preached by the elders of Israel and published in the books 
of the Church, I have been filled with joy and satisfaction, for it seemed 
natural to me to receive these things. Although not one of my family 
and kindred received this gospel, yet It seemed perfectly natural to 
me to drink in of the streams that flowed from the eternal fountain, 
and today I bless and praise the name of the Lord for his goodness to 
me, in opening the eyes of my understanding and enabling me to see 
and comprehend the truth as it is in Jesus Christ, and that I am enabled 
so far to continue in the path, in the good work of the Lord. I can 
say, with the Prophet Joseph Smith, my course has been always, ap- 
parently, up-stream. I have not been favored like some of my breth- 
<-n with having been born in the faith, or of parents that were in the 
faith, or of associations until I came in the Church with people called 
Saints ; so my career during all the years that I have been in the service 
of the Church has been one continual struggle, so to speak. But my 
path has been a pleasant path, so far as enjoying the principles of eter- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nal life is concerned, and so far as the influences that have been 
thrown around me in the gospel and in my associations with the Saints 
and servants of the living God, it has been a continual pleasure to me, 
and today I rejoice with all my soul that I am in harmony with my 
brethren in the Priesthood and with the Saints of God who desire to 
serve him and keep his commandments. 

IN HARMONY WITH THE BRETHREN ON THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 

This is a glorious day for me. I find myself in perfect harmony 
with that which has been said by our brethren today, and with the sen- 
timents expressed by President Grant, a week ago last Sunday, in 
which I believe most of the people, at any rate those who heard or 
have read the remarks that he made, feel that they were right and 
true and applicable to the present situation. I take great pleasure in 
announcing that so far as I know, all our close associates, the First 
Presidency, and Council of the Twelve, who are here at home — some 
of them are away — are in accord with President Grant in that which 
he did in reply to the manifesto, as it is called, sent from the East, 
which came by telegraph, and he telegraphed back his pleasure in sign- 
ing his name with that of Ex-President Taft and a number of other 
prominent American citizens, desiring that the pact or covenant of the 
League of Nations should be approved by the Senate of the United 
States and that without delay, making some little lee-way for clarifica- 
tions, perhaps, in some of the text, so long as it did not interfere with 
the full signing of the treaty. I believe we are of one heart and mind 
on that particular question, but we do not call into question the sin- 
cerity of some of our friends who do not see exactly as we do on this 
matter. 

CONCERNING LIBERTY AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. 

I am also in hearty accord with President Grant in the sentiments 
expressed this morning concerning the liberties of mankind. I believe 
in the doctrines of the Declaration of Independence ; I believe in the 
principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States ; I also 
believe in the destiny of this great government which God set up, the 
constitution of which was written by men who were raised up for the 
very purpose of placing on record principles that will bring about, 
eventually, the freedom of "all flesh." I believe it is the destiny of this 
great nation to carry the principles embodied in the two instruments 
I have named to all the world, and that this will be a preparation for 
that great day of universal peace referred to by President Lund, this 
morning. The liberty of mankind is not to be limited except to the ex- 
tent of oppressive tyrannizing over and preventing the freedom of peo- 
ple who differ from us. I agree with President Grant on that matter 
that he talked about this morning, — that it is right for men to have the 
liberty to combine for their own benefit, for the raising of wages, for 
the shortening of hours of labor, for anything that will be for their 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 47 



good and benefit, but they must not exercise that in a way to infringe 
the liberties of others who do not see as they see. The idea of a Lat- 
ter-day Saint, a man holding the Priesthood of the Most High, given 
for a blessing, for persuasion, for instruction, for light and for the 
liberties of mankind, saying that a brother in the Church shall not have 
the privilege of obtaining work for the support of himself and family, 
unless he joins some society and has a card to show his membership 
therein! That, I think, is going far beyond the bounds of the liberty 
of American citizens. We have no right to trench upon the freedom 
of others. It is permissible to stand up for our own individual rights, 
to stand up for the rights of any association with which we are con- 
nected, unless such association involves oppression and tyranny upon 
any portion of mankind. 

THE LORD HAS SET UP THE ENSIGN OF PEACE. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints was revealed from 
heaven in the last days, to bring about the liberties of the world. For 
all nations the Lord has "set up an ensign" as the Prophet Isaiah pre- 
dicted he would. Read the 18th chapter of the book of Isaiah, also the 
11th chapter and the Sth chapter. I will not turn to them now — you get 
them, and read them. The Lord declared that some time he would raise 
an ensign to the nations of the earth : "All ye inhabitants of the world, 
and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on 
the mountains ; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye." The ensign 
has been raised. Brother Brigham, when he went up on the moun- 
tain here just after the arrival of the pioneers, said tnat was "a good 
place to raise an ensign." I don't know that the ensign was raised right 
then and there, but the real ensign alluded to is the ensign of peace 
which is in the gospel of Jesus Christ sent down from heaven anew in 
these last days. It is to be brought by Zion, as Isaiah the prophet 
said, "Oh, Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high 
mountain." That has been fulfilled in the coming here of the people 
who are now gathered in these mountain valleys, and the word of the 
Lord is going forth and it is to be carried to every nation and kindred 
and tongue and people. 

THE REVELATIONS OF GOD AND THE COVENANT OF PEACE. 

Some of our brethren will say, perhaps : •But do not the revela- 
tions of God, ancient and modern, declare that there will be tribula- 
tions and troubles and wars and bloodshed in the last days?" Cer- 
tainly. Is that any reason why an ensign of peace should not be 
lifted up? Is that any reason why the gospel of peace should not 
be preached? Is that any reason why nations and communities and 
clubs and associations shall not be formed for the establishment of 
peace, for the proclamation of peace, for attempts to bring about har- 
mony among the nations of the earth, preparing them for that day of 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



universal peace? I see nothing in any of the revelations of God, 
ancient or modern, that should stop or hinder in any way proper 
efforts made for the bringing together of the nations of the earth 
in a bond of peace. President Grant read some hymns this morning, 
all appropriate, all having good texts. I would like to read a hymn 
that we used to sing when I was a boy, when I first embraced the 
gospel, written by Parley P. Pratt, one of our splendid poets, one 
of the great men of the latter days, one who proclaimed the gospel 
at home and abroad. Here is what he says, on page 102 of-our Hymn 
Book,- hymn 92. He was the author of the first hymn in the book, 
the Church hymn book. I don't say anything against Psalmodies, or 
The Songs of Zion — they are all good, but there is our Hymn Book, 
not bound quite so well as it might be, perhaps, but it is our Church 
Hymn Book, very difficult to find in many of the stakes of Zion, 
and in some of the wards you cannot find one, but he is the author 
of the first hymn, a most splendid piece of poetry. I will read the. 
first one — the President says to read them both : 

The morning breaks the shadows flee; 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

The clouds of error disappear 

Before the rays of truth divine; 
The glory, bursting from afar, 

Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 

The Gentile fulness now comes in, 

And Israel's blessings are at hand; 
Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin. 

Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

Jehovah speaks! let earth give ear, 

And Gentile nations turn and live; 
His mighty arm is making bare, 

His covenant people to receive. 

Angels from heaven, and truth from earth 
Have met, and both have record borne; 

Thus Zion's light is bursting forth, 
To cheer her children's glad return. 

i 

This is changed a little from the original but that does not mat- 
ter so very much. 

Now here is the %mn that I was referring to: 

Lo! the Gentile chain is broken 

Freedom's banner waves on high; 
List, ye nations, by this token 

Know that your redemption's nigh. 

See on yonder distant mountain, 

Zion's standard wide unfurled; 
Far above Missouri's fountain, 

Lo, it waves for all the world. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 49 



Freedom, peace and full salvation 

Are the blessings guaranteed — 
Libe-rty to every nation, 

Every tongue, and every creed. 

Come, ye Christian sects, and pagan, 

Pope and Protestant and priest; 
Worshipers of God or Dagon, 

Come ye to fair freedom's feast. 

Come, ye sons of doubt and wonder, 

Indian, Moslem, Greek or Jew; 
All your shackles burst asunder; 

Freedom's banner waves for you. 

Cease to persecute each other, 

Join the covenant of peace; 
Be to all a friend, a brother; 

This will bring the world release. 

Lo! the King, the great Messiah, 

Prince of Peace shall come to reign; 
Sound again, ye heavenly choir, 

Peace on earth, good will to men. 

PREPARATION FOR PEACE NECESSARY. 

The point that I wish to make is this : While the numerous 
prophecies concerning the terrible times of tribulation of the latter 
days are about to be fulfilled, and are being fulfilled now, yet there 
should be efforts made to bring about peace, if possible, among the 
nations of the earth; and it seems to me that it is the province, the 
right, the duty of Zion -in her beauty rising, in the mountains, to send 
forth all the aid possible and to lend a ready hand to help bring about 
peace on earth, good will to men. Do you think, my brethren and 
sisters, that when Christ shall come as the King of kings, the Lord 
of lords, that there will be no preparation made for that coming? Do 
you think that he will come and by a great ■ cataclysm, will turn 
the warring nations into peaceful, united peoples? Oh, no. Some 
one will say, perhaps, he is going to utterly destroy them. Don't you 
believe it. When Christ comes there will be people dwelling on the 
earth who will not perish; many of the wicked will be destroyed 
"by the brightness of his coming," but before that a work of prepara- 
tion will have to be accomplished and the principles which belong 
to our government and which are now being extended in the efforts 
to bring about peace will have softened the hearts of nations, the 
leading nations of the earth, so that they will combine for mutual 
help, and agree, instead of going to war and drenching the earth 
with human blood, that they will come together in a fraternal spirit 
and settle their difficulties by arbitration or submit them to courts 
of justice, which will be provided for, so that the rights of each other 
may be fully made plain and clear to all the world. That is the ob- 
ject in view. 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I had the pleasure of meeting as a delegate in some of the con- 
gresses for the world's peace when I was abroad, particularly on my 
last mission to Europe, a number of the finest men and women who 
can be met with outisde of this* Church, great men, great women, 
with great minds and of great influence who advanced theories that 
were not practical. But they were good', philosophical, kind people 
with splendid desires. But the first real practical thing they tried 
to bring about was the disarmament of the great nations, that the 
number of their men in armies and navies should be diminished, that 
the munitions of war should be decreased in production, and the way 
be thus prepared for some kind of league or union by which the na- 
tions of the earth could come together in a solemn compact for the 
purpose of bringing about peace, so far as it could be established. I 
don't think there is any ardent advocate of the measures now being 
taken who makes the contention that this pact, if it should be signed, 
will bring about entire suppression of war or the war-like spirit. Not 
at all, but if there is anything practical that can be done to bring 
about disarmament among the nations (except by agreement when 
circumstances may arise to require arms and ammunitions), any- 
thing that can bring that about is in the right direction. It may 
not accomplish all that its advocates expect it to do, but it will pre- 
pare the way for that which eventually will come. The ideas will 
thus be presented to nations that have power and influence in the 
earth whereby they can make agreements by which wars shall be 
diminished and eventually abolished, so that the time will come, also 
predicted by the prophets, when "nation will not rise against nation 
nor kingdom against kingdom," and they will not even "learn war 
any more," but every man, spiritually speaking, can sit down "under 
his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make him afraid." 

That time will come. I am just as sure of it as I am that the 
sun will rise tomorrow morning. I don't know whether I will be 
here to see it, but it will rise just the same, no matter how much 
the clouds may come up, and I am just as sure that "the Sun of 
righteousness will arise with healing in his wings," as the ancient 
prophet predicted, and the bright rays of his glory will penetrate 
to the utmost parts of the earth, and he will indeed be the King of 
glory and the Prince of peace. 

WE ARE NOT TO CEASE OUR EFFORTS AGAINST EVILS, 
BECAUSE EVILS ABOUND. 

But before that day comes there will be wars and rumors of 
wars, and plague and famine, and earthquake and divers evils, as 
we call them, which will only be, perhaps, the beginning of greater 
sorrows yet to come. I believe that these predictions will come to 
pass, but should that prevent all that are lovers of their race from 
making any efforts to bring about a different condition of things ? 
If the "flu" or any other plague should go over the land again, are 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 51 



we to sit down and say, "Oh, it was predicted, it will come and we 
cannot do anything against it?" If iniquity abounds, as Christ said 
it would, and because of it "the love of many would wax cold," is 
that any reason why we should not take steps against those iniquities? 
We are forming a social society, many of our brethren here, men 
that are capable of handling the subject, and the Lord knows, if he 
doesn't the devil does that something is needful to be done, needful 
for our young people, particularly, and those social workers are busily 
engaged in the good work, and they will be more busily engaged by 
and by, when they get a routine prepared and methods adopted by 
which we can reach the evil. Shall we cease from our efforts 
against evil because evils will abound and because '"evil men and 
seducers will wax worse and worse," as predicted by the Savior? 
Are we not to take steps to try and check the evil ? Take the Book 
of Mormon. That predicts wars and at the same time provides and 
tells what shall be done. Read the writings of Mormon and Moroni 
m the Book of Mormon. There is a labor imposed upon us, so it 
tells. What is it to do? Why, to check these evils, to proclaim 
against them, to unite together for peace and for harmony and for, 
brotherly love, for the prevalence of the spirit of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. So that the words of Parley may come to pass and the heav- 
enly choir will sing again the anthem, "Peace on earth, good will to 
men." 

READ THE PEACE PACT FOR YOURSELVES. 

Now, I want to feel a good spirit toward my brethren who do 
not see it the way I do, exactly, and I want them to feel the same way 
towards me. I have most profound convictions in regard to this 
matter. I have read the propositions for a covenant of peace care- 
fully, over and over, and over again, and I find that nearly every- 
thing that some of the great men and statesmen want to put in the 
pact is there already, and some things that they want taken out are 
not there at all. There has been a great deal of misrepresenta- 
tion concerning it, and another thing I find to my great regret, that 
I have talked to a large number of our prominent men personally, 
and they have never read it themselves-, they have had to go by what 
the proponents and the opponents have had to say and they are be- 
wildered about it. They don't see and read and understand for them- 
selves, as Jesus taught in his day, "Whoso readeth, let him under- 
stand." And that is something they should do in regard to this cov- 
enant, read the articles and compare them and see the bearing of 
the different articles, one upon another. I say here, that to my mind, 
it is one of the grandest things ever presented to the people of the 
world. There is nothing anywhere to be compared with it. Do I 
say it is perfect? No, but it provides means for its perfection, or 
for its correction, plenty of means provided for anything that needs 
to be put into it, or anything that needs to be taken out of it, just 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as it was with our great Constitution of the United States. Now, I 
did not intend to talk directly on this subject this afternoon, but it 
has come to mind as I have been speaking., 

i 

ON THE NECESSITY OF OBEDIENCE TO. LAW. 

Now, my brethren, men holding the Priesthood of the Almighty ! 
This has been sent down for the salvation of mankind, not merely 
for the honor of men who are called and ordained to the several 
offices in the Priesthood, not merely for that, although it is a great 
honor to be a priest of the Most High, a servant of the living God, 
clothed upon with divine authority, for that is what Priesthood means, 
divine authority, no matter whether a person has but a small part 
of divine authority or in its fulness, he has it, he is definitely called 
and ordained to certain duties — what for? For the salvation of 
the world, of all nations, kindreds and tribes and tongues. That is 
what that is for, and for the establishment of freedom. The flag of 
liberty, as Parley says, "waves on high," and "list ye nations, by this 
token, know that your redemption's nigh!" The time is coming 
when the nations shall be redeemed from tyranny and oppression and 
from seeking each other's, blood, fighting for that which they could 
acquire by proper reason and by reasonable argument and reason- 
able associations and courts. 

Now, my brethren, do you think any of you that may be en- 
gaged in the order that President Grant alluded to this morning, 
have any right to say to a man that because he does not see as you 
do, and does not carry a card showing that he belongs to a certain 
society, that he shall not work, you will not work with him ; if he 
gets a job, and people employ him, you lay down your tools and say 
you will not work with him? Is that right? Is that reasonable? Is 
that Christ-like? Is that brotherly? Is it in accordance with the 
principles of liberty in the Constitution of the United States and 
the Declaration of Independence? I believe with all my heart that 
if our brethren holding the Priesthood of the Lord were to combine 
together for everything that is good in these societies, but will not 
go one step farther than that which is their right to do, that they can 
control the situation and they will also avoid the great troubles of 
mob law. There are projects now on foot — I have learned about 
them — to make a mob and go up to the Legislature to try and per- 
suade the law makers to do or not to do certain things. Will Latter- 
day Saints do that? Men are elected to the Legisature to frame 
laws for the good of the State and they ought to be left free to use 
their best judgment. That is what they are elected for. But gath- 
ering mobs to try and influence them is all wrong. The right to peti- 
tion is proper, but there is a proper way to make petitions and we 
ought to have respect for those who have been selected to occupy 
places in our government, and all should be obedient to law. Look at 
the fruits of mobocracy in Omaha, alluded to by President Grant this

morning. That is only one outburst. If this is allowed to go on 
there will be a vast deal more trouble in the land. It is a great 
menace of the latter times ; and I want to read a few verses from the 
Book of Mormon in regard to what the Lord said many hundreds 
of years ago in regard to this very thing. You will find it on page 
587. In ancient times on this land there were organizations, "secret 
combinations" they are called. Now, I don't say that what I am going 
to read applies directly to a simple order of labor, but it applies to 
the situation generally, and to what is to come of it. Moroni is 
writing on the subject of that which was found upon the records 
that he discovered from the people that came on the land anciently, 
and it is called the Book of Ether and he is quoting from that arid 
reasoning upon it and he says : 

And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths, and com- 
binations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among 
all people, and they are had among the Lamanites, 

And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am 
now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi. 

Now, page 588 : 

And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get 
power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall 
be destroyed, for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his Saints, 
which shall be shed by them shall always cry unto him from the ground 
for vengeance upon them, and*yet he avenge them not; 

Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things 
should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and 
suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you, which 
are built up to get power and gain, and the work, yea, even the work of 
destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the eternal 
God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction, if ye shall 
suffer these things to be; 

Wherefore the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things 
come among you, that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, 
because of this secret combination which shall be among you, or wo be 
unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from 
the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who build it up. 

For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up, seeketh to overthrow 
the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass 
the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the 
father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents; yea, 
even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the be- 
ginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered 
the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning. 

Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things, that evil 
may be done away, .and that the time may come that Satan may have no 
power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be per- 
suaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of 
all righteousness and be saved. 

There are glorious promises made in this book to the Gentiles, 
"if they will obey the God of this land, which God is Jesus Christ, 
the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world," all on conditions. But

wars will come, no doubt; disputes will arise, but if the efforts now 
being made are carried out, they will succeed in bringing people to- 
gether who have good sense and good judgment, representing the 
leading nations of the world, who will submit their difficulties to 
one another and then to arbitration, or courts of justice, as may be 
necessary, and stop the shedding of blood and promote harmony and 
peace, prepare the world by learning and understanding truth, by 
understanding real freedom and the proper action of nation with 
nation until one great brotherhood is established among the nations 
and the way will be prepared for the coming of the Lord. We do 
not expect full peace, full justice, full glory and unity and brotherly 
love until the reign of Christ is established, but it will come just as 
surely as the light shineth from the East even unto the West, so 
shall the coming of the Son of man be. Read the 24th Chapter of 
Matthew, as revised and published in the Pearl of Great Price — 
T will not take up time to read it now, — there are many passages of 
old scripture that I would like to read, if there were more time, but 
I have said enough on this point. 

LET US UNITE AS ONE. 

Now, what I desire this afternoon in my soul is that the Latter- 
day Saints, people who have been reserved in the eternal worlds by 
our Father in Heaven, until the last days, to come down on the earth 
and aid in the great dispensation of the fulness of times, which is to 
bring about the redemption of the human family, living and dead, 
will unite together and be one. 

Let Zion in her beauty rise, 
. Her light begins to shine; 
Ere long her King will rend the skies, 
Majestic and divine. 

Let us prepare ourselves for the day, in our. hearts, in our spirits, 
in our works, in our efforts, let us combine for mutual good and for 
the good of the world, and understand that the destiny of this great 
nation, which the Lord has raised up, is to carry the gospel of free- 
dom, of liberty, of union, of brotherly love into all the nations of the 
earth, if they will receive it, and a great many will. 

I here bear testimony that my brethren standing in high places 
in the Church, through the providence of God, are united in this, 
That we desire the welfare of mankind ; we desire that liberty 
shall be extended ; we desire that bloodshed shall be stayed ; we de- 
sire that war shall cease ; we desire that men shall meet in a fraternal 
spirit to bring about harmony and good-will among the nations, and 
we believe in the doctrine of the Covenant ; we believe it is practi- 
cal, whether everything that is being done is just exactly that way, 
we will leave to the wise men among the nations. Some of the very 
best among them are engaged in the work to bring this about, and 
if anything appears to be imperfect that can be corrected in due time. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 55 



PRAYER FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

In regard to the President of the United States, the eloquent 
prayer for his recovery that was offered by Brother Whitney, found 
an echo in my soul. My heart went with it. I met the gentleman 
here, and I have pleasure in bearing witness to what President Grant 
said this morning concerning him, personally, and I do hope that now 
he is lying possibly on his death-bed, the wicked slanders that have 
been sent abroad, reported here in Utah, in Zion, concerning him will 
cease, if for no other reason than the condition that he is in. I have 
the greatest assurances that .can be given that those stories which 
have been circulated concerning his personal morality are not true. 
I believe that he is a good man ; I believe that the Lord has been 
with him ; that he has accomplished a mighty work among the 
European nations ; and I believe that he is sincere and that his heart 
beats for the good of the whole world, and for the good of the United 
States in particular, because he is the President thereof. 

Now, everybody is at perfect liberty to dissent from that idea 
if they have any reason for it, but that is my conviction. I have 
had interviews, associations, with men and women in different lands 
all over the continent of Europe, and throughout the United States, 
and I know a little something about discernment, and my discern- 
ment is to the effect that what Brother Grant said about Woodrow 
Wilson this morning is eminently true and right. May the Lord 
bless him and heal him, _and may the Holy Spirit, which comes from 
above, to bring about peace and harmony and good will, enter into 
our souls, unite us together for every effort that will be for the wel- 
fare of humanity, and the glory be to God, through Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer. Amen. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, I. have greatly rejoiced in the spirit and 
power of this meeting, and also of our first session that was held this 
morning. Surely the Lord is with his people and with his servants, 
and the inspiration of his Spirit is upon them. Gathered here in this 
house is a great host of people, mostly adult members of the Church. 
In the Church there are also another great host, the host that I refer 
to are the children of the Latter-day Saints. We have them among us 
in great numbers. They have been committed to our care and keeping 
by the Lord. We are the children of the Father, and our little ones are 
also his children. He is the Father of their spirits, and we are ^ie 
fathers and the mothers of their bodies. And thus is the relationship 
between us and our heavenly Father cleary defined, as also between 
us and our children — a relationship that is indeed very intimate.

man's duties to multiply and replenish the earth. 

When the Lord placed Adam in the Garden of Eden, it was found 
that he was alone. God saw that it was not good for man to be 
alone ; therefore, he brought the woman to him to be a companion and a 
helpmeet, and he joined them together in marriage. Thus, marriage 
received divine sanction in the very beginning of the race. The Lord 
said unto our first parents : "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish 
the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over * * * every 
living thing." This great commandment had reference to the poster- 
ity of Adam and Eve, which should follow. The law was made bind- 
ing upon them ; and I do not believe, that it was contemplated by this 
great commandment that conditions such as we find in the world at the 
present time should exist ; wherein many parents restrict their offspring 
to one or two children. This seems especially deplorable in view of the 
fact that parents are endowed with a God-given power of procreation, 
and that it is within their province and ability to have numerous chil- 
dren. 

God said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." And 
so this law is made binding upon men and women in the world through 
the marriage relation. Whenever this sacred covenant has been guarded 
properly and observed among men, they have been blessed and pros- 
pered. 

It was so in ancient Israel. The law respecting marriage was in- 
troduced by Moses, the great law giver, and was very strict. Those 
who violated it were subject to extreme penalties. You will remember, 
that when the children of Jacob, or Israel, as he is called, went down 
into Egypt, they numbered something like seventy souls and when they 
came out of Egypt, out of bondage their number exceeded six hundred 
thousand souls. Thus during a period of four hundred years the 
children of Israel, while in Egypt, were greatly blessed and multiplied, 
and this blessing continued with them during .their journeys in the wil- 
derness. When they came into the land of Palejtine they were a 
highly favored people. They were blessed, however, only so long as 
they observed to keep the commandments of God, so long as they held 
sacred the great and glorious covenant of marriage, but when they de- 
-parted from it, as they sometimes did, and drifted into evil ways, and 
sometimes into immorality, the anger of the Lord was kindled against 
them and his judgments fell upon them. It was so in that time; it has 
been so, in all ages of the world, and with all the nations of the earth. 
Great and mighty kingdoms have gone down to destruction and to ob- 
livion because they broke the everlasting covenant of marriage and de- 
parted from the way of virtue. This is a solemn thing, indeed. 

We can learn many lessons from history. You will remember 
what David, the Psalmist, the sweet singer of Israel, said in respect 
to children. The words will be found in the one hundred twenty-sev- 
enth Psalm : 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON. 57 

CHILDREN A PRIZED GIFT OF THE LORD. 

"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is 
his reward. 

"As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the 
youth. 

"Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be 
ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate." 

So, I think we may regard children as a great and precious gift 
from the Lord, a gift that is much to be prized. The Savior in his day 
clearly defined the status of children. People brought their little ones, 
so that they might see the Savior, and that he might touch them. 
When this aroused the anger of the disciples, and they rebuked those 
who brought the children forward, the Savior, who was much an- 
noyed, said : 

"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of 
such is the kingdom of heaven." 

Then he uttered this solemn warning : 

"Except ye become as little children ye cannot enter into the kingdom 
of heaven." 

His language signified that little children were innocent before 
the Lord, and worthy of consideration, worthy of attention and notice ; 
and that they must not be passed by and ignored. This was, certainly, 
a beautiful example. So, my brethren and sisters, in these latter 
times, Israel is under that great law, the first great commandment 
which was given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. 

A REMARKABLE PICTURE. 

It is expected of us that we should be fruitful and multiply and re- 
plenish the earth ; and, so far as the Latter-day Saints have observed 
this great and important law, they have been blessed of God, and 
they have been multiplied, greatly multiplied, in all the stakes of Zion. 
In every ward we have many large families. It is not an uncommon 
thing to met a woman who has had ten or twelve or fourteen children ; 
and sometimes you will meet women in the Church who have had as 
high as eighteen children. I. met one such woman, and I asked her 
casually how many children she had in her family. She said : 

"Brother Clawson, I have had eighteen children, and most of 
them are living." 

I said to her : 

"All honor to you. Surely you are blest of the Lord; and I look 
upon you as a veritable queen among women." 

Just the other day, in attendance at one of the quarterly con- 
ferences — the conference of the Montpelier stake — I was speaking 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



on the subject of marriage and I saw in the congregation, before me, 
a woman with eleven children, all sitting together and occupying an en- 
tire bench in that congregation. There was a nursing child upon her 
lap, and ten other children. She had twelve children, but one was 
dead. Her entire family of children were with her there in that meet- 
ing, and I presume her husband would have been with her also, but, 
being a railroad man, he could not be excused from his duties. It was 
.a remarkable picture, and I felt in my heart to praise the Lord that 
we have such women among us — women and men, too, of course, who 
are willing to honor the law of marriage, who believe in it, who be- 
lieve in large families. 

THE SAINTS BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES. 

Our leaders, in the Church, believe in large families, and that is 
generally the example that they have set to the people. President Brig- 
ham Young was the father of many children, very many; I know 
not how many, but a host of children. John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, 
Lorenzo Snow, and the late Joseph F. Smith, all had large families. 
My own father, the late Bishop Hiram B. Clawson, was the father of 
forty-two children. President Joseph F. Smith was the father of 
some forty-three or forty-four beautiful children. I have seen them 
all in a single group picture. It was fascinating. I could hardly take 
my eyes from that picture. I marveled at it, to see this man, the 
leader of the Church, the Prophet of God, sitting in the midst of his 
own family, composed of a great host of children. Surely in a time 
to come his seed will be as the sands upon the sea-shore, and as the 
stars in heaven for number. Blessed was he, and blessed were these 
great men of the Church, with the large families that God gave them. 
They were indeed blessed. They honored the law of marriage, and they 
preached it to the people all the days of their lives. 

And so we also preach it. We preach it today to this people 
and we say to them : be careful aiid guard this glorious principle, and 
honor it in your lives. Exercise these God-given powers of procreation, 
as far as you reasonably can; and Latter-day Saints, do not interfere 
with the fountains of life, and do not cut off your posterity and restrict 
them. Do not limit them to that extent that your only hope is hanging 
by a thread. For this is not pleasing to the Lord. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY IN LARGE FAMILIES. 

Then, oh, how great is the responsibility that goes with these chil- 
dren, when they come into our homes ! Do you not know, brethren 
and sisters, that the pure spirits of these little children who are among 
us were sent down from heaven to take upon themselves mortality? 
It takes the body and the spirit to constitute the soul of man. That 
was the blessing that you received at your birth. That is the blessing 
that I received. I came down upon this great mission, to secure my 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON. 



59 



body ; and oh, how thankful I am, how I rejoice and praise the Lord 
for this precious gift! So we are blessed and so our children are 
blessed. 

There is another grave responsibilty, that should not be lost sight 
of, and it is the obligation resting upon us to teach and train our 
children in the principles of eternal truth, to teach them everything 
pertaining to the everlasting gospel, and to train them up in the way 
they should go ; because, as with us, so with our children. They must 
learn to subdue and bring into subjection the evil appetites of the body, 
the unrighteous desires of the heart, and the sinful inclinations that 
spring out of the heart through the body. These things must be con- 
trolled in order that our chidren may grow up- without sin, if possible, 
unto salvation; and that in the future they may take up these bodies 
from the grave and go on to exaltation and glory. 

RESPONSIBILITY RESTS IN THE HOME. 

Now, let me say briefly that the first great obligation, with refer- 
ence to the children, rests with the parents themselves in the home. It 
is upon you, fathers in Israel, and it is upon you, mothers. The Church 
has done much, the Church is doing much, to assist yuu in the work, 
of training your children. God has so ordered it that we have organ- 
izations in the Church which are intended to give help to parents in 
the training of their children ; but that does not relieve the parents of 
their obligations. We have the Sunday Schools with at least one hun- 
dred twenty-five thousand children; and we have the young people's 
organizations. We have the Primaries with twenty-five or thirty 
thousand children ; and we have the Religion Classes with about an 
equal number. We have the quorums of the Lesser Priesthood, enroll- 
ing great hosts of boys, in the deacons' quorums, in the teachers' quo- 
rums and in the priests' quorums. Of course, these boys, many of 
them, belong also to the Sunday Schools and other auxiliary organiza- 
tions. They are a great army, these boys and girls, and they must 
have training and education, they must be instructed, and trained in 
the principles of eternal truth. A great work is being done in these 
splendid societies that were inspired of the Lord. Teachers in these 
organizations are giving their time without money and without price, 
freely, for the instruction of the children. 

What are you doing, brethren and sisters? Are you sending. your 
children to these places of instruction? Do you support them? Are 
you fostering the Religion Class? Are you giving good support to the 
Primary organization, to the young peoples' societies, and to the Sun- 
day Schools? Above all, I repeat it, above all, are you givivng proper 
instruction yourselves to your children in the home, by precept and by 
example? If parents want their children to be good children, they 
will have to be good themselves. If they want their children to keep 
the Word of Wisdom, they must keep the word of wisdom themselves. 
If they want their children to be prayerful, they must also lead out 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and pray. If they want their children to pay tithing, then the parents 
must pay tithing. It is not sufficient to say to a child, "Go thou and 
do so and so," because more than likely the child will not go. But if 
the parents say, "Come now, with me, and do so and so," the child 
will go with the parent. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I have felt in these few words today 
to emphasize the grave responsibility which is resting upon us with ref- 
erence to our children ; and, let me say, in addition, we should guard 
our children against evil companionship and evil doing, against the 
immoralities of the world today, which are very great. 

Do you always know, parents, where your children are? If you 
are at home in the evening, and they are away, do you know where they 
are? That is the question. Do you know what company they keep? 
Do you know what hours they keep? If you would bring them up 
properly you must know these things ; you must be posted ; you must 
keep your eye upon the children, because many of them are weak, 
and all of them are inexperienced. They are beset by temptations, and 
they need your counsel and your aid. 

Woe unto that man, or woe unto that woman who despises little 
children, who passes them coldly by, who ignores them, and who has no 
thought or love for them, because these little ones are the gift of God 
unto man, precious immortal souls. Let us remember this, brethren and 
sisters, and let us give the children that care and attention that are es- 
sential to their welfare and salvation, which is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

It is three and one-half years since I last had the opportunity of 
attending a general conference of the Church, and I assure you, my 
brethren and sisters, that this opportunity affords me much genuine 
pleasure. I have been delighted with the privilege of meeting so many 
of the brethren and sisters with whom I have had a personal acquaint- 
ance, and I regret that I am unable to entertain in my own home, at 
conference time, those of whose hospitality I have partaken while 
visiting the stakes in Zion. 

THE SITUATION IN THE BRITISH MISSION 

As most of you are aware, I have but recently returned from 
England, Liverpool being the headquarters of the European mission 
over which I had the honor of presiding while there. Since my re- 
turn, many people native of Great Britain, and elders who have lab- 
ored there, have enquired of me as to the conditions of the people and 
of the work in that mission. No doubt but there are others to whom a 
brief recital of conditions over there will be of interest. Before the 
war there were from three to four hundred missionaries from Zion 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS.

laboring in the British Mission. But few local brethren were used 
as branch presidents and none as conference presidents, nor as travel- 
ing elders. A prohibition by the British Government having been 
placed upon aliens entering the county, it became impossible to keep 
up the former memebrs. No missionaries arrived in Great Britain 
between December, 1916, and Mar. 31, 1919, and our force of elders 
from home was reduced to seven in June of the present year, when 
we received ten others. This, however, did not represent our entire 
missionary force, for we had called into the service a .number of local 
brethren and sisters who did yeoman service for the Lord, which 
labor also proved a great blessing unto those who were thus employed. 
When I left Liverpool, last July, we had twenty-three local brethren, 
laboring as traveling elders and in the neighborhood of three hun- 
dred seventy-five local lady missionaries laboring in the British mis- 
sion. All of the seventy-five branches, and ten of the thirteen con- 
ferences were presided over by the local elders. The tithes of the 
mission increased materially each year while I was there and during 
that period almost doubled in amount. The number of con- 
versions to the Gospel also kept up well ; in fact, during the year, 1917 
we had more baptisms in Great Britain than during either 1916 or 
1915, when there was a considerably larger number of elders em- 
ployed. There is scarcely anything connected with the church that 
stimulates the faith of the elders so much as to give them; responsibil- 
ity. Activity in the cause inspires love for, and interest in it. I have 
proven to my satisfaction that when we work for the Lord we love 
, him more, and as we love him more, we have more desire to work for, 
and serve him. It works both ways. It is equally true that if we have 
no appreciation of what the Lord has done for us and what he de- 
signs to do for us, we will not have much affection for him, and if we 
do not love him we will not give to him much valuable service. Love 
and service to God and man are necessary qualifications in order to 
obtain eternal life, the greatest gift of God to man. 

We have proven that the British Mission is self-sustaining as 
well in its working arrangement as in its finances. The work can 
be carried on by the local brethren and sisters if we be not permitted 
to send missionaries from Zion. What I have said with reference to 
the British Mission is measurably true in regard to all the European 
missions. 

THE GREAT WAR. 

The great European war had been in progress two years before 
I arrived in England. During my stay in that land, I saw it ended 
by the signing of the armistice. I was there also during the sitting of 
the Peace Congress. We had a varied experience and had feelings 
of great anxiety over there as you had here, and perhaps we had occa- 
sion for being more anxious. We were nearer the war zone. < The 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



wounded were brought home to us in England by the train loads. All 
the hospitals were filled and school buildings and private residences 
were converted into hospitals and filled to their capacity. It was 
evidenced on every hand that a terribly destructive war was being 
waged in close proximity to us. The daily news paper reports of the 
sinking of ships by the enemy and the frequent raids made upon the 
coast cities of England by zeppelins and other enemy air craft and 
by the German war ships were all calculated to unnefve the people 
and cause them to realize the horrors of it all. I think, too, that the 
newspapers did not reveal all the damage done to life and property 
in England. There was a significant purpose in keeping it camou- 
flaged. I am happy to be able to say that through all these exper- 
iences there were but few casualties among the Latter-day Saints. We 
were constantly praying for the protection of the elders and the 
Saints at home as well as for those who had gone to the front and 
we acknowledged the protecting care of God which was over them. 

It was necessary for most of our elders to return home during the 
war period which was extremely dangerous as the enemy submarines 
were lying in wait for them. Mines laid by the enemy were also a 
constant menace. All ships were obliged to travel without lights at 
night and as a consequence many collisions occurred and some sink- 
ings. A ship on which some of our elders had embarked was run 
into and damaged so that she had to return to harbor for repairs. 
These things caused us great anxiety but, thank the Lord, none of our 
elders lost their lives from such causes. I tried to live near to the 
Lord so as to receive inspiration from him to direct the affairs of 
the mission and that his protection might be over us and I encouraged 
the Saints to do likewise and we feel that our prayers and labors 
were not in vain. 

THE UTAH AND IDAHO SOLDIERS IN ENGLAND. 

Many of the United States soldiers came through Liverpool en- 
route to France. A rest camp was established at Knotty Ash, on the 
outskirts of Liverpool where there were almost constantly great num- 
bers of American soldiers. Some of our "Mormon" boys were billeted 
there for weeks. We had the pleasure of a visit at Mission head- 
quarters from Brigadier-General Richard W. Young, Chaplains Brig- 
ham H. Roberts and Calvin S. Smith and many others. Chaplains 
Roberts and Smith addressed the Saints in Liverpool. Some of our 
soldier boys stationed at London rendered valuable missionary assist- 
ance. We were able to help some of our boys while they were in 
France by providing them with garments, such clothing as could not 
be obtained elsewhere in that country. Some of the boys had the 
spirit of missionary work having previously had that kind of exper- 
ience. We supplied them with literature for distribution and very 
much gpod and some conversions were accomplished in that way.

BURYING GROUND OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. 

Before leaving for home, accompanied by Sister Richards, Elder 
Arnold G. Holland of Rexburg and Albert Smith, son of President 
George Albert Smith, I went out to Ellerton cemetery on the out- 
skirts of Liverpool where six hundred forty American soldiers were 
buried, they having died from the influenza and other causes, and by 
permission -of the care taker dedicated those graves. The section of 
the cemetery used for these burials is apart from the main burial 
ground and is a beautiful place. The graves are made in systematic 
order and the name and number of each person buried there are 
plainly indicated by lettering and numbering on a cross made of 2 x 
4 hardwood standing about two and a half feet above ground. A 
register is also kept in the sexton's office. This information should 
be of special interest to those having friends or relatives buried there. 
The influenza plague afflicted the people there as it did the people in 
this country causing wide-spread fatality among soldiers and civil- 
ians, the strong and fit seeming to be special objects for its attack. 

THE HAND OF GOD IN THE VICTORY FOR THE ALLIES. 

While the war was in progress we were naturally anxious and 
were praying that the Lord would give the victory to the Allies, with 
the United States associated, believing that they were in the right. 
When the war did come to an end with the signing of the armistice 
we believed that God had given us the victory that militarism might 
be crushed and that those glorious principles vouchsafed to us 
through the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this 
great country might be established in the countries of Europe. I 
think I would be doing less than my duty if I did not acknowledge 
the hand qf the Lord in this victory and did not praise and thank him 
with all my soul for this deliverance. 

I believe that the field of God's activity is not confined to his 
Church, and that inspirations from him is not limited to the general 
authorities of the Church or its membership. There are millions of our 
Father's children in other countries, whom he loves and in whose wel- 
fare here and hereafter he has deep interest. He desires that this gos- 
pel of the Kingdom shall be preached to them as it has been preached 
to us and to our fathers. 

GOSPEL DOOR TO THE NATIONS WILL BE OPENED AS RESULT OF THE WAR. 

It is my firm belief that as a result of the war and the victory 
to the Allies that the doors of nations hitherto closed against us to 
the preaching of the gospel, will be opened and that we will be per- 
mitted to enter into those new fields and into fields which have been 
restricted in the past, and preach the everlasting gospel. This will 
help compensate for the loss sustained.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



While the Peace Congress was in session we were praying in 
secret and in public that the members of that body might be inspired 
to produce a treaty which would be just to all the nations, one which 
would be acceptable to all. We were also praying that some provis- 
ion might be made by which such wars might forever be prevented. 
When that important body of men, after months of careful, prayer- 
ful deliberation brought forth the Peace Treaty including the League 
of Nations Covenants, I believed that God had been instrumental in 
its accomplishment. Why should we not expect answer to our prayers 
and theirs? 

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, GOD'S WAY TO PEACE. 

I returned from my mission on the 25th of July and on the 27th 
spoke from this stand. Without any previous intention of mention- 
ing the League of Nations, and not knowing that in this country there 
was strong oppositions to the League Covenant, I stated as my be- 
lief that President Woodrow Wilson is one of the greatest men of his 
time, and that in his work pertaining to the war and peace that he 
had been inspired of the Lord. Nothing I have read or heard from 
the opponents to the League Covenant has caused me to change my 
mind. I am glad to know that my attitude towards this the most im- 
portant question under consideration by the nations at this time, is 
in harmony with that of the President of the United States and with 
the views of the President of the Church. 

The constitution of the United States, though established by the 
Lord, through wise men whom he raised up for that purpose, was not 
perfect and later had to be amended. It, too, was opposed by men 
who were considered wise, but the greater wisdom prevailed. The 
League Covenant may not be perfect but I believe that it is the pro- 
duct of wisdom and of inspiration, the same as was the constitution 
of this country, and that the Lord will see it through, also that it will 
be effective in preventing wars between the nations which are con- 
ceded to be the most calamitous. 

I believe that had there been a League of Nations such as the one 
now offered, when Germany launched this war, it never would have 
been accomplished and the world would have been saved all the loss of 
life and property and the broken hearts the war entailed. Think of it, 
my brethren and sisters — seven and one half millions of people killed 
on the battle field. It would require seven hundred fifty tabernacles 
of the capacity of this one, ten thousand, to hold that number. A 
destruction of one hundred eighty-six billions of the world's wealth 
can only be comprehended by those who have been accustomed to con- 
sidering enormous sums of money. Do we want a repetition of such 
catastrophe? Something is in need of being done to prevent it. A 
League of Nations as a part of the Peace Treaty is the only thing 
offered. Even the opponents to the League offer no substitute. It is 
a case of negativing that which is offered as the best and only solu- 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 65 



tion of a much perplexed question. The cause of the proposed 
League of Nations like that of "Mormonism," is a positive one. Its 
opponents are negative. We say that the League can be used to pre- 
vent wars between nations ; they say it will fail of its purpose, and are 
trying to make their predictions come true. We say, let us give it a 
trial ; they say no, it is useless to do so. There was a certain wise man 
in the days of the primitive church, educated at the feet of the great 
Gamaliel. He was a persecutor of the Saints, but through the 
special providence of God he was made to see his mistake. Accord- 
ing to his own testimony he had acted conscientiously. We can afford 
to give those who oppose the League credit for being conscientious, 
and we should ask ourselves : Is it not possible that I am mistaken 
in this matter? 

I have asked myself that question and have analyzed my position 
the best I could but have not been able to arrive at any other con- 
clusion than that in this thing I am right. I have been used to the 
inspiration of the Spirit oi God and if I am not mistaken, I have 
inspiration upon this subject; that it is God's way of helping, to es- 
tablish peace and good will on earth, and I am not sure but that a 
fight against the League of Nations, as it has been presented to the 
Senate of the United States for ratification is a fight against God. 
May he deliver us, I pray, and guide us aright in all things. ' May 
he inspire the members of the United States Senate who have the 
responsibility of ratifying the Treaty, including the Covenant -of the 
League of Nations, as he inspired our fathers in the forming of the 
Constitution of the United States. Surely the interests of many na- 
tions surpass the interests of one. God remembered the needs of 
this nation in times of great peril, and I believe that he will not be 
unmindful of us now, and of those who fought with us for such great 
and glorious principles, and of the other nations, for they are as much 
in need of his divine providence as we. May the Lord add his bless- 
ing, I pray, in the name o£ Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations, now look up; 
It waves to all the world; 
In Deseret's sweet, peaceful land — " 
On Zion's mount behold it stand! 

For God remembers still 

His promise made of old, 
That He on Zion's hill 

Truth's standard would unfold! 
Her light should there attract the 'caze 
Of all the world in latter days. 



His house shall there be reared 
His glory to display; 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And people shall be heard 
In distant lands to say, 
We'll now go up and serve the Lord, 
Obey His truth, and learn His word. 

For there we shall be taught 
The law that will go forth, 
With truth and wisdom fraught 
To govern all the earth; 
Forever there His ways we'll tread, 
And save ourselves with all our dead. 

Then hail to Deseret! 

A refuge for the good, ' 
And safety for the great, 
If they but understood 
That God with plagues will shake the world 
Till all its thrones shall down be hurled. 

In Deseret doth truth 

Rear up its royal head;* 
Though nations may oppose, 
Still wider it shall spread; 
Yes, truth and justice, love and grace, 
In Deseret find ample place. 

Conference adjourned until Saturday morning, 10 o'clock. 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder David R. Langlois, 
President of the Burley stake of Zion. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, October 4, 1919, at 10 a. m. 
The congregation was called to order by President Heber J. 
Grant. 

The choir and congregation sang : 

O say, what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce; 
And priceless the value of truth will be, when 
The proud monarch's costliest diadem 

Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or Gods can aspire: 
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies; 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 



The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp, 

When with winds of stern justice he copes, 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast 

And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes. 

Then, say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er: 
Though the heavens depart, and the earth's fountains burst. 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Don B. Colton, President of the 
Uintah stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word! 

^VVhat more can He say than to you He hath said, 

*You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled? 

In every condition, in sickness, in health, 
In poverty's vale or abounding in wealth, 
At home or abroad, on the land or the sea, 
As thy days may demand, so thy succor shall be. 

Fear not, I am with thee, O, be not dismayed, 

For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid; 

I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, 

Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. 

IWhen through the deep waters I call thee to go, 
The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o'er-flow, 
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress. 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, 
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply. 
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design 
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine. 

E'en down to old age, all My people shall prove 
My sov'reign, eternal, unchangeable love; 
And then, when gray hair shall their temples adorn, 
Like lambs shall they still in my bosom be borne. 

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose 

I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes; 

That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, 

I'll never, no never, no never forsake! 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

I hope we shall all be able to remember the many good things 
that have been spoken during the previous sessions of this Conference. 
It is not what we eat, but what we digest, that makes us strong. It is 
not what we hear that makes us learned, that fills us with knowledge, 
which is power ; it is what we remember and profit by and make a wise 
use of. Attention is the mother of memory. So my old teacher, Doctor 
Park, used to say ; and I have demonstrated the truth of his teaching. 
It is wonderful what the memory will do, if it be trained and given 
a chance. 

A PHENOMENAL MEMORY. 
« 

I heard a story of a colored gentleman who possessed a phenomenal 
memory. He was the keeper of the cloak room at a fashionable hotel, 
and his memory served him so faithfully, that he was not under the 
necessity of using checks when the guests left with him their hats 
or coats or canes. When they returned for them, he never failed to 
give each man his own. A certain judge went to that hotel for the spe- 
cial purpose of testing this man's marvelous memory. He gave him 
his hat — a hundred others did likewise — and passed into the dining 
room. Returning in about an hour, sure enough, he got the right hat 
back again. "Well,' he exclaimed, "that is remarkable. How did you 
know that was my hat?" "I don't know that that is your hat, judge," 
said the keeper. "Well, why did you give it to me, then?" "Because 
you gave it to me." (Laughter.) 

THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 

I am in hearty accord with the inspired teachings of my brethren. 
I haven't a great deal to say on the subject of the League of Nations; 
but I can say that I am heartily in favor of it. I believe in the League 
and in the Peace Treaty, not because it is a perfect proposition — I do 
not regard it as the key to God's kingdom, nor as the gateway to the 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

glorious Millennium ; but it looks to me like a good piece of pavement 
reaching in that direction, and I propose to step up out of the mud and 
walk on the pavement so far as it goes and as long as it lasts. 

"THE SHOULDERS OF THE PHILISTINES." 

President Grant told us yesterday that President Woodruff's fa- 
vorite hymn was the one beginning : "God moves in a mysterious way, 
his wonders to perform." God does so move ; but he does not al- 
ways bring to pass his purposes by means of miracles or through the 
instrumentality of his chosen people. Seven hundred years before the 
birth of the Savior, the Prophet Isaiah, looking down the vista of time, 
saw the Latter-day gathering of the scattered House of Israel, 
and said concerning them: "They shall fly upon the shoulders of 
the Philistines toward the West." We recognize the fulfilment of that 
prophecy in the founding of this Church by Joseph Smith, a lineal de- 
scendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who thus lifted the Ensign for 
the gathering of their descendants from their long dispersion among 
the nations. But a part of the fulfilment rests with the Gentiles. Their 
steamships, their railroads, their means of rapid transit and communi- 
cation — these are "the shoulders of the Philistines," upon which the 
children of Ephraim have been and are being brought to the West, 
to the land of Zion, where the New Jerusalem is to rise, where the 
pure in heart will assemble, and the necessary preparation be made 
for the coming of the Lord in his glory. God works outside as well 
as inside his Church, and uses big things and little things for the ac- 
complishment of his purposes. 

IMPORTANCE OF LITTLE THINGS. 

We must not despise the small things, for they are often the seeds 
of great things. Flake on flake piles up the mighty avalanche, and the 
stir of a stone on the mountain-side hurls the whelming mass into the 
valley below. 

We must not expect miracles unless the occasion demands them. 
God is a wise economist. He would not take a bludgeon to brain a 
gnat, nor a thunder-bolt to kill a flee. He always suits the weapon to 
the warfare, the tool to the task required of it ; and he is the God of 
the whole world, the God of the big and the little, the high and the 
low. He is over all things, and neither man nor Satan, with all their 
free agency, can by any possibility thwart the Divine Will. 

napoleon's overthrow. 

The other evening, while pondering some of these thoughts, -I 
picked up, not for the first time, Victor Hugo's famous master-work, 
"Les Miserables," in which is given a wonderful description of the 
Battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon, the conqueror of the world, was 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



overthrown by the combined English and Prussian armies, in the month 
of June, 1815. Concerning that great and decisive struggle, Hugo 
says : 

"If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of 
June, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few 
drops of water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All 
that Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Auster- 
litz was a little more rain, and a cloud traversing: the sky out of season 
sufficed to make a world crumble. * * * The Battle of Waterloo 
could not be begun until half-past eleven o'clock, and that gave Blucher 
time to come up. Why ? Because the ground was wet. The artillery 
had to wait until it became a little firmer before they could manoeuvre." 

Yes, it is a historical fact that Napoleon, the greatest artillery- 
man of the ages, had more cannon on the field of Waterloo than did 
Wellington or Blucher — but he could not use them. Our author con- 
tinues : 

"Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the 
action would have begun at six o'clock in the morning. The battle 
would have been won and ended at two o'clock, three hours before the 
change of fortune in favor of the Prussians." He adds, sententiously, 
that it was not Wellington ; it was not Blucher — it was God who over- 
threw Napoleon! 

HOW FAMINE COULD COME. 

I believe in the doctrine. I have seen, during the past summer, 
while traveling to and from a number of the Stakes of Zion, north, 
south, east and west — I have seen the whole land parching and burn- 
ing under the torrid rays of the sun — no rain, no moisture, and the 
farmers, discouraged, all their labor in vain, talking of "pulling up" 
and moving away. An extraordinary season it has been, the dryness, 
the drought, beyond anything of the kind I have ever witnessed ; and 
I was born right here in Salt Lake Valley where drought is not un- 
common. I have thought how easy it would be for God to bring a 
famine upon the land, simply by withholding the rains of heaven — the 
"few drops of water" that overthrew Napoleon by coming down, and 
could so easily destroy the world if they were kept back. 

god's promises and prophecies conditional. 

All God's promises and prophecies are conditional. "Who am 
I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled? I 
command, and a man obeys not; I revoke, and they receive not the 
blessing." There never was a time in the history of the world when 
a nation against which a divine prophecy, a proohecv of disaster, had 
been uttered, could not obtain a revocation of the edict, if thev were 
willing to pursue the course that God desired them to take. He sent 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. ,71 



Jonah to Nineveh, to tell them that within forty days that great city 
should be destroyed ; but Nineveh repented, and God revoked his 
decree. The judgment passed over, but it would surely have come if 
the king and nobles and people had not humbled themselves and done 
the thing that was required of them. There is always an alternative — ■ 
no "dead-open-and-shut" . business about God's dealings with men. 
He gives them a chance. 

JOSEPH SMITH AND THE CIVIL WAR. 

Joseph Smith predicted the war between the Northern and the 
Southern States — told where it would begin, and named the question 
over which it would arise. It was on Christmas Day, 1832, that he 
foretold that great conflict, and twenty-eight years and some months 
later it began, the first gun being fired on Fort Sumter, April 12, 1861. 
Seventeen years before the war broke out, the Prophet made an effort 
to avert the awful calamity that he saw impending over his country. 
Was it inconsistent of him to do so — to utter a prediction and then 
work to prevent its fulfilment?. No, — that is not the way to look at 
it. He was a prophet of God, and he knew that the nation was en- 
titled to an alternative. We hear it said, when a man dies : "It was 
his time to die." And so it was — it must have been, or he would not 
have died. But a man's time»can change, according to the course taken 
by him. If he does what God requires, what he was sent into the 
world to do, there is no reason why he should not remain to fully ac- 
complish the purpose of his mortal creation. But if he is unwise, and 
dissipates his strength ; if he does wrong and weakens his powers, then 
he shortens his life and his time to die comes earlier. 

Joseph Smith made an earnest effort to ward off the very cal- 
amity that he had predicted. And how did he propose to do this? 
Early in 1844, a few months before his martyrdom, he became a cand- 
idate for President of the United States, and sent forth the Apostles 
and Elders of the Church to present his "views on Government" to 
the people of the States of the Union. Incorporated in the platform of 
political principles upon which he proposed to stand, was a provision 
for the liberation of the slaves of the South — not by violence, not by 
confiscation, thus despoiling their owners ; for the slaves were their 
property, inherited from their fathers and grandfathers : The Prophet 
recognized this "fact, and he said, let the Nation purchase the slaves 
and set them free : let the colored man owe his liberty to the Govern- 
ment as a sift; the money for the purchase to be realized from the 
sale of public lands. Eleven years later, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the 
great philosopher, made the same identical suggestion, and was praised 
and commended for his humane and just proposition — though his ad- 
vice was not taken. How many of those who praised Emerson appre- 
ciated Toseph Smith, who had offered the same suggestion eleven years 
before? It's an awful thing to be a "Mormon!" — in the eyes of the 
world, at least. We are proud of it. The Prophet's counsel was 



72 



GENERAL .CONFERENCE. 



not acted upon. The hate-blinded politicians of that period thought 
they saw ''a more excellent way," and the great war came that cost 
this nation a million lives, a billion of treasure, and planted those ter- 
rible heart-burnings that separated the South from the North far more 
effectually than Mason and Dixon's line ever did or could. 

THE JACKSON COUNTY SAINTS. 

In the year 1831, the Latter-day Saints, directed and inspired 
of God, attempted to build Zion in Jackson County, Missouri, and 
establish a condition of affairs that would be a preparation for the 
Lord's glorious coming. If they had but followed the counsel of their 
heaven-inspired leader; if they had put into practice God's law for 
the building up of Zion, and without which there can be no Zion in 
the fullest and highest sense, they could have succeeded even at that 
early day, for the Lord said so in just that many words. But they 
failed to do as he required, and another set of consequences ensued. 
They were "not united, according to the union required by the law of 
the celestial kingdom." They did "not impart of their substance, as 
becometh Saints, to the poor and afflicted among them." They were 
not what Enoch's City had been — "Zion, because they were of one 
heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness, and there was no poor 
among them." The Jackson County colonists were the best people 
that could be had at that time for the puijjpose, but they were not good 
enough to carry out God's holy design. "There were jarrings and con- 
tentions and envyings and strifes and lustful and covetous desires among 
them ; wherefore, by these things they polluted their inheritances ;" 
and the Lord, who had promised that if they woufd pursue a certain 
course they should build up Zion, now permitted their enemies to come 
upon them and drive them from the "goodly land." Banished — exiled 
for failing to fulfill God's purpose. 

ZION NOT MOVED. 

Banished, but not forsaken! In a revelation given soon after- 
wards, the Lord said to his people : "Let your hearts be comforted 
concerning Zion ; for all flesh is in mine hands : Be still and' know 
that I am God. Zion shall not be moved out of her place, not- 
withstanding her children are scattered. They that remain, and are 
pure in heart, shall return and come to their inheritances, they and 
their children, with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste 
places of Zion." Until then, he had "other places" he said, for the 
gathering of his Saints, and they should be called "Stakes of Zion." 

THE GLORIOUS FUTURE. 

The Elders were told that they must "wait for a little season for 
the redemption of Zion." The people were to become mighty, not only 
in numbers and in material influence, but mighty by the power of 
God descending upon them as an endowment from on high. When the 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



n 



time should be ripe and all things ready, then, said the Lord: "Mine 
angels shall go before you, and also my presence, and in time ye shall 
possess the goodly land." Again : "I will fight your battles. Behold, 
the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies ; 
and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage 
and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for 
the gathering together of my saints." 

We must live God's laws if we desire to reap his promises. The 
Latter-day Saints of Jackson County were a far better people than 
those who mobbed them and drove them from their homes ; but a lack 
of preparedness hindered them from playing their full part in the 
great work that God had designed. The mighty event, however, was 
only postponed. Zion, in due time, will be redeemed; Israel will be 
gathered; and the preparation made that is necessary to precede the 
advent of the King of kings. 

GOD J S COVENANT WITH ENOCH. 

More than five thousand years ago a prophet of God obtained a 
promise from him in relation to these things, and I will now read to 
you a portion of that promise: 

"And the Lord said unto Enoch: As I live, even so will I come in the 
last days, in the days of wickedness and vengeance, to fulfill the oath which 
I have made unto you concerning the children of Noah; 

"And the day shall come that the earth shall rest; but before that day 
the heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; 
and the heavens shall shake, and also the earth, and great tribulations shall 
be among the children of men. 

"But my people will I preserve. And righteousness will I send down 
out of heaven, and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testi- 
mony of mine Only Begotten, his resurrection from the dead, yea, and also 
the resurrection of all men; and righteousness and truth will I cause to 
sweep the earth as with a flood, to gather out mine elect from the four 
quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, an Holy City, that 
my people may gird up their, loins, and be looking forth for the time of my 
coming; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called Zion, a New 
Jerusalem. 

"And the' Lord said unto Enoch: Then shalt thou and all thy city meet 
them there, and we will receive them into our bosom, and they shall see 
us; and we will fall upon their necks, and they shall fall upon our necks, 
and* we will kiss each other. 

"And there shall be mine abode, and it shall be Zion, which shall 
come forth out of all the creations which I have made; and for the space 
of a thousand years the earth shall rest." 

THE GREAT PEACE. 

There is the great peace promised for this suffering, war-torn 
planet. Enoch saw the glorious dawn, and likewise "the darkest hour" 
before the dawn. We are living in the Saturday evening of Time. 
God gave to this earth seven days, or seven periods' of a thousand 
years each, in which to accomplish its mortal mission — -six working 
days and a day of rest, the period of sanctification. Four thousand 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



years, or four of those great days, had passed before Christ was cruci- 
fied ; and nearlj two thousand years have gone by since. Consequently, 
we are now at the end of the week, in the Saturday night of human 
history. Morning will break upon the Millennium, the thousand years 
of peace, the Sabbath of the world. And any man, nation, or move- 
ment that turns its steps in that direction, is walking toward the 
Light! 

This is a wonderful prediction. It began to be fulfilled when the 
Father and the Son appeared to the boy Joseph, in the spring of 1820. 
Let it not be forgotten that the first to bear testimony of the Only Be- 
gotten of the Father in this dispensation was the Father hirnself, for he 
said to that boy : "This is my belovevd Son, hear him." It was Right- 
eousness looking down from heaven ; and subsequently Truth came 
out of the earth — the inspired records of the ancient past, containing the 
fulness of the Everlasting Gospel. Down from Heaven came the 
powers of the Priesthood, the authority to preach that Gospel to all 
the world as a witness bef ore the end ; and ever since that day truth and 
righteousness, or the Gospel preached by the power of God, has been 
going forth to gather his elect and bring them to their promised land. 
The gathered Saints are up here in the Rocky Mountains, out of harm's 
way, comparatively speaking, founding Stakes of Zion, as a preliminary 
to the establishment of Zion proper ; and we shall remain here until our 
. preparation is complete. When the right time comes, and all things 
are ready, the pure in heart, chosen from the midst of this people, will 
go down in the might of the Lord and redeem Zion. 

THE SONG OF THE REDEEMED. 

Then shall the New Jerusalem be built, and the way prepared for 
the return of the City of Enoch and for the glorious coming of the 
Lord. Then shall be realized the blest condition described in this song 
of the redeemed: 

The Lord hath brought again Zion, 

The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel. 

* * * 

And Satan is bound, and time is no longer. 

The Lord hath gathered all things in one: 

The Lord hath brougth down Zion from above, 

The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath. 

The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength', 

* * * 

And the heavens have smiled upon her, 
And she is clothed with the glory of her God; 
For he stands in the midst of his people. 

Amen. 

Edna Gothberg sang a solo : "I will lift up mine eyes." 



ELDER DAVID O. MCKAY. 



75 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 

I wish to read a few words from one of the strongest testimonies to 
the divinity of the mission of Christ that we have in sacred literature. 

A TESTIMONY TO THE DIVINE MISSION OF CHRIST. 

Peter and John had the previous day passed by a lame man who 
had sat at the temple from his youth, after having been carried there, 
and sought alms from those who had gone into the temple to worship. 
You remember that Peter answered his pleadings by saying: "Silver 
and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee. In the name of 
Jesus of Nazareth, rise and walk." Later, as these apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ were bearing testimony of his divinity in Solomon's 
Court, they were arrested and put in hold until the next day when 
they were brought before the council, and as they stood before their 
accusers this is what Peter is reported to have said : "If we this day be 
examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means 
he is made whole, be it known unto you all, and to all the people 
of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye 
crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man 
stand here before you whole. That is the stone which was set at - 
naught of you builders, which has become the head of the corner. 
Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name 
under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." That is 
my testimony to Israel and to the world today. There is none other 
name under heaven given among men whereby 'we must be saved. 

CHRISTIANITY HAS NOT FAILED. 

It is now about one year ago, following a session of the fall con- 
ference held at that time, and just a few weeks before the signing of the 
armistice that put an end to the carnage of the most terrible conflict of 
the world, that I met a very dear friend who wanted to know how such 
a catastrophe could overtake the worloVin the light of the fact that 
Christianity had been preached for nearly two thousand years. Said 
he : "Christianity has failed, and," he added, "the pepole of the world 
generally accept it as a fact that Christianity has failed. Let us ap- 
proach some man as we walk up this street, and ask him the question ;" 
and it chanced that we overtook a young man whom we both knew, and 
just as my friend had aaid, when he put the question: How do ycu 
explain this world's_ catastrophe in the light of Christianity? he an- 
swered : "Christianity has failed." 

VIOLATION OF CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES BROUGHT ON THE WAR. 

I took issue with them then, and I take it today, by answering that 
the conditions which brought about that world conflict were un-Chris- 
tian. There was no Christianity in it. The world did not have Chris-

tianity. Now, at first thought that might seem unjust to the many 
honest, true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. I mean many who in 
their hearts profess belief in the principles of Christianity and who in 
their lives sincerely desir.e to live those principles. I grant there were 
many such honest souls in the world. There are hundreds of thou- 
sands of just such honest souls, but I say, too, that it was not from 
their ranks that the evil, which precipitated the world war, sprang. It 
was not from those who obeyed Christian principles that thfe carnage 
and bloodshed came. It was from those who violated Christian stand- 
ards, who rejected the principles which Christ taught and who even 
went so far as to reject, not only his divinity, but the very doctrines 
which he advocated. I haven't time, I shall not take the time, even to 
name those principles, hut there are two or three fundamental things 
which stand out in Christ's teachings the mere mention of which will 
be sufficient to make my point. 

THE KINGDOM OF GOD A REALITY. 

What was the burden of Christ's teaching when he came among 
men? The first great proclamation was the announcement that the 
kingdom of God is at hand. "Repent for the kingdom of God is at 
hand." The fore-runner, John the Baptist, preached that. . He preached 
the coming of the Lord. He showed the position which the Lord would 
hold in that kingdom and the Savior bore witness to it and preached 
the same. And what was that kingdom? Not a mystical, but a real 
kingdom; not just a feeling within, but an outward expression of 
righteousness. It was divine government among men. That was what 
the Savior had in mind, the establishing of a divine government among 
men. 

I was pleased the other day, in reading a book written by a man 
who rejected Christ as the Redeemer, to find that even he had to 
acknowledge that Christ's principles would finally establish just such a 
kingdom. This is what he says, in Problems of Religion: . 

But after all, there was a deeper truth in his dream of the coming 
of a golden age and his own pa#t in its establishment than any of his con- 
temporaries could know. Though its coming be far more remote than he 
thought, the time will yet come when God's will shall prevail on earth, 
and in the bringing on of that cosummation he will be seen to have in truth 
played the master role. 

\ 

To the Savior of the world, to the twelve, and the many other dis- 
ciples, the kingdom of God, as taught by the Redeemer, was indeed a 
reality in which the government of men would be one of justice, love, 
charity, mercy, truth, not just an ephemeral condition, but indeed a 
reality. 

REQUIREMENTS OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD. 

What were the conditions, the requirements of citizenship in that 
kingdom ? The first great lesson to the Jews in the Meridian of Time 



ELDER DAVID O. MCKAY. 



77 



was this; That God, the eternal Father, is indeed our father, not just 
creator, not just omnipotence, but a father unto whom they could go, a 
father of love. The word "father" as it relates to God, we are in- 
formed, appears about seven times in the Old Testament. It is found 
ten times in the New Testament to one in the Old. More than a hun- 
dred times in the New Testament God is spoken of as Father. The 
first condition, the first requirement of citizenship in that kingdom was 
faith in our Father, obedience to his will, honor to his name. They 
were told to defile not his temple, profane not his name, to hold it 
sacred, to reverence him, worship him in spirit and in truth, and the 
first prayer, model prayer, given to them : "Our Father, our Father." 

The second was one of purity, charity, -love, not only for God the 
Father, but for his children. 

The third was service, losing themselves for the good of others. 

Even Christ's enemies will admit that these are the fundamental 
principles as taught by the Redeemer of the world. The existence of 
his Father in whose likeness he was. "If ye have seen me, ye have 
seen the Father." Second, boundless love for his children, and third, 
service. 

APPLY THESE REQUIREMENTS TO CONDITIONS PREVAILING NOW AND DUR- 
ING THE WAR. 

Now apply those general principles to the conditions which were 
rampant in the world one year ago and which are rampant in the world 
today. Belief in God! Where was it manifest? There was an out- 
ward form, it is true, worshipping with their lips, but their hearts were 
far from him, and you know and the world knows today that they had 
heaped to themselves Gods of the world, as the prophet Joseph clearly 
points out they would do, in Section one of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
idols after the fashion of the world. The nation that precipitated the 
great war, worshipped the God of power, the God of militarism, and 
while it is not right to take a few isolated statements from men, though 
they be leading men, and say all the people were prompted by that same 
ideal, yet these things indicate the trend of thought of the men who are 
responsible for that world-catastrophe, and there is no Christianity in 
it. In the application of the principle of charity for all, purity of 
thought, cherishing honor, integrity of soul, why, they have violated 
every principle of it. Note the spirit as exemplified in this remark when 
that power looking forward to the consummation of their military ideal, 
having France in view, said : "We must crush France," or to use the 
exact words: "France must be so completely crushed that she can 
never again come across our path." 

IS THIS CHRISTIANITY? 

Christianity? Why, it is the spirit of the evil one. It is crushing, 
it is death, and what was the purpose of it? To build up the god of 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



state ; and to them the state knew no law — could be bound, said one of 
their men, could be bound by none of its own laws, for according to 
Treitschke the state could not bind itself over against other states "by 
any obligation, not even of its own making." Is it any wonder, then, 
that when they found a neutral nation in their path, to defend which 
they were bound in all the honor which a sacred agreement could bind 
them, that they tore up that agreement as a mere scrap of paper? Is 
there any Christianity in that? 

SELFISHNESS AT THE BASIS OF TURMOIL, WAR, AND UNREST. 

The third point, service, to each other? Only one nation to serve 
and that was the nation itself. The selfish, the self must be protected 
though others be crushed. So we might go on for hours, if necessary, 
pointing out conditions, small in themselves, but mighty in their con- 
sequences, as has been so eloquently pointed out by my beloved 
fellow laborer, Brother Whitneyfflsmall in themselves, but mighty in 
their consequences, indicating that it was not because of Christianity, 
but because of the rejection of Christian principles that these conditions 
came upon the world. 

i 

CHRIST AND HIS DOCTRINE THE ONLY WAY TO PEACE. 

So it is today, my brethren and sisters. There are honest people 
in the world, there are true Christian people in the world, but it is not 
from them that present-day trouble springs. You do not find hatred 
and enmity in their hearts. The men who desire to wring from the 
poor that which does not belong to them, are not prompted by Christian 
principles. The men who are revengeful against others simply because 
others have property, are not prompted by Christian principles, and to- 
day it is our duty to preach Christ and him crucified and to declare 
to all the world that he is indeed the chief cornerstone, that through 
him, and by him, and only by obedience to his principles, can we have 
that peace, happiness, contentment and prosperity in the world for 
which we are all longing and praying. 

HOW TO PREACH CHRISTIANITY. 

The best way to preach that, my dear fellow workers, is by ex- 
ample. Start to have or be sure that you have in every Latter-day 
Saint a truly Christian spirit. Is there prayer in that home? Are 
you following Christ's admonition to pray to the Father and teach 
your children to pray, that godliness, reverence for God and his work, 
every day may be impressed upon the hearts of your children? That 
should be in every home. Pray not only for yourselves, but pray even 
for your enemies. Are you charitable in your homes and your organiza- 
tions for those who are not of the same opinion as you ? We talk about 
service to others. Too often when service is mentioned we think of 



ELDER DAVID 0. MCKAY. 



79 



some physical aid that we might render. I tell you a better service can 
> sometimes be given to others by speaking well of them, or, if you can- 
not speak well of them, by refraining from speaking of them at all, 
than .by any physical aid which we can give. O, how gloriously Christ 
taught us that principle of charity when those self-righteous men 
dragged into his presence that fallen woman and almost with a curse 
threw her at his feet, asking him what he would do to her. The law of 
Moses said she should be stoned to death. What do you say? He 
wrote with his finger in the sand, and without looking at her accusers, 
said: "Let him that is without sin cast the first stone." Then went 
on writing. One by one they slunk away, and when he looked up, none 
was there. Said he: "Woman, where are thine accusers?" "They 
are all fled." "Is there not one left to accuse thee?" "No, not one." 
"Then neither do I accuse thee." He, who could not look upon sin 
with the least degree of allowance, could say, "neither do I accuse thee ;" 
but note : "go thy way, and sin no more." The person separated from 
the sin, from the act. The sin was just as detestable, was just as 
heinous in his eyes, but the poor creature was to be saved. Let us in 
our dealings with one another separate the thing from the individual if 
we can, and not wound one another's feelings, serve one another as 
true Christians should serve by upholding one another. 

THE APPLICATION. 

Now, I mention that simply to make this application. Before 
thirty days shall have passed we may be in the heat of an election. 
We never get angry at people towards whom we are indifferent. We 
never get injured over the contemplation of a thing that is not very dear 
to us, but we do get angry when one who is' near to us disagrees with 
us. We get hurt and in the heat of passion say things for which after- 
wards we are sorry. Let us in very deed apply our principles of Chris- 
tianity and speak well of those who might happen to disagree with us. 

Nay, speak no ill, a kindly word 

Can never leave a sting behind, 
And oh, to breathe each tale we've heard, 

Is far beneath a noble mind. 
Full oft a better seed is sown, 

By choosing thus the kinder plan, 
For if but little good is known, 

Still let us speak the best we can. 

That is good doctrine. It is good' to be applied in our quorums, in 
our associations, in our groupings, during the discussion of heated 
questions. 

ONLY THROUGH CHRIST IS RIGHTEOUSNESS ESTABLISHED. 

Brethren and sisters, there is only one name given under heaven 
whereby the principles of righteousness, of peace, of contentment, of 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



eternal life can be established among men and that name is Christ, the 
Redeemer of the world. I know he is our Savior. I know the world 
must accept him. They must sooner or later bow before him as the 
King of kings, and the Lord of lords. That the Lord will help us to 
be true to him, help us to bear testimony to the world by our acts, by 
gentleness, charity, love, service to one another and to the world, that 
we know that he has revealed to men in this dispensation the truth that 
God lives, that his Son is the Redeemer of the world and that the gospel 
is the eternal plan of salvation, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Elder Charles H. Kent sang a baritone solo: "I know that my 
Redeemer lives." 

ELDER ANTHONY W.TVINS 

And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the 
Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall 
be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

And many shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain 
of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his 
ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, 
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: 
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into 
pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall 
they learn war any more. 

HOW TO OBTAIN BENEFIT FROM THE SCRIPTURES. 

/' 

We are told, my brethren and sisters, that all scripture is given 
by inspiration from God, and that we should search it carefully, be- 
cause in it we think we have eternal life. 

To derive the greatest benefit from the written word, it is neces- 
sarv that we be familiar with the entire text ; it is impossible to form a 
correct conception by the simple reading of an isolated passage ; we 
must be familiar with that which goes before, and follows after it, and 
more than all else, we must be able to discern whether that which we 
read is a definite declaration of the purposes of the Lord, or simply 
a condition which depends upon the actions of men for its fulfilment, or 
non-fulfilment. 

A very common error, and one which has led to criticism of the 
scripture, and lack of faith in the printed word, is the fact that men 
confound the word of the Lord, as it applies to his definite plans, and 
unchangeable purposes, with the words of the prophets, who, moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, foretold events which were to occur among 
the inhabitants of the earth, many of which events were not decreed 
of God, but, on the contrary, were obnoxious to him, contrary to his 
will, and entirely due to the disobedience of the people, who, despite 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



81 



the word and will of the Lord, brought judgment upon their own 
heads. 

AN ILLUSTRATION. 

To illustrate that which I wish to express I will read from the 
Book of Mormon : 

And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea 
in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the 
land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord 
God had preserved for a righteous people; and he had sworn in his wrath 
unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, 
from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only 
God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should 
come upon them. 

And now we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that 
it is a land of promise, and whatsoever nation shall possess it, shall serve 
God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come 
upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are 
ripened in iniquity. 

For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; where- 
fore he that doth possess it shall serve God, or shall be swept off; for it is 
the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity 
among the children of the land, that they are swept off. And this cometh 
unto you, O ye Gentfles, that ye may know the decree of God, that ye may 
repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye 
may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you, as the in- 
habitants of the land hath hitherto done. 

Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it, 
shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if tkey will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, 
who hath been manifested by the things which we have written. 

AMERICA DEDICATED TO JESUS CHRIST. 

In this scripture we have the definite, unchangeable decree of God 
concerning America. It is, and will always be a choice land, choice 
above all other lands. It will always be a land dedicated to the God of 
the land, who is Jesus Christ. The latter part of the prediction is en- 
f'rely conditional. Whatsoever people inhabit this land shall serve 
the Lord ! and if they observe to do so, they are to be free from all 
other nations, and are never to be brought down into bondage, but the 
moment they depart from the truth, and turn from the Lord, the prom- 
ise ceases to be effective ; they have no promise, but on the contrary the 
Lord says that when they are ripened in iniquity, they shall be de- 
stroyed, or in other words, they will bring destruction upon themselves, 
as it has come to all nations when the protecting power of the Lord 
is withheld. 

The word of the Lord, which I have read was delivered to the 
people of Jared, and they were given this land for an inheritance, on 
condition that they would serve the Lord of the land' who is Jesus 
Christ. They rejected the truth and were destroyed. The promise 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



was repeated to the Nephites, they were warned that this was a land 
dedicated to the service of the Lord, and were advised of the destruc- 
tion which had come to the former inhabitants, because of their lack 
of faith, but notwithstanding this fact, that their prophets warned 
them of the judgments which were to come to them, because of their 
iniquity, and that the Messiah visited them in person, and promised 
them redemption, through faith in him, they became faithless and 
wicked, and finally disappeared as a nation. It was not because the 
Lord decreed their destruction, or that he desired it. On the contrary, 
he desired their redemption, and provided a way by which they could 
attain to it, but they wilfully rebelled against God, and brought their 
own destruction. 

PURPOSES OF GOD ACCOMPLISHED BY OTHER MEANS THAN MEN EXPECT. 

/ 

One great difficulty with mankind has been that^ they have ex- 
pected the purposes of the Almighty to be accomplished by means dif- 
ferent from that which he has used. The coming of the Messiah, and 
his mission to mankind, was taught in the very beginning of time. The 
Jews looked for their Redeemer, believed that he would come, but they 
refused to accept Jesus, because of the humility of his birth,' and the 
character which he assumed among men. They looked for one who 
would come in pomp and splendor, to tread down their enemies, and 
restore the kingdom, as it existed under their great king, David. The 
simple Nazarene, to them the son of an humble carpenter, they would 
not accept, notwithstanding the fact that the power of the Lord was 
manifest in his life and works. He was rejected by his own people, and 
persecuted unto death. 

At the time of his death light came into the world ; there was no 
darkness when the night came, angels upon the hills of Judea sang, 
"Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will to men." He 
bore witness that he came to bring salvation to his people, and wept be- 
cause they rejected his offering. "O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, * * * 
how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a 
hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not ; Behold, 
your house is left unto you desolate. * * * Ye shall not see me 
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of 
the Lord." 

That the mission of the Christ failed, so far as the redemption 
of the House of Israel, at that time, was concerned, was not the fault 
of either the Father or the Son, but was because of the fact that the 
people rejected the truth, and wilfully sinned against light. Peace 
might have come to the world, and redemption to mankind at that time 
had the people desired it, and. been obedient to the voice of the Son 
of God. 

John, in the revelation given on the Isle of Patmos, saw another 
angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to 
preach to them that dwell upon the earth, crying with a loud voice, fear 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



83 



God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment has come. 
Christ bore witness that in the latter-days the gospel of the kingdom 
would be preached in all the world, as a witness to all people, before 
the end should come. 

These declarations have been preached from every pulpit in Chris- 
tendom. Men have looked forward to a great miracle, a mighty angel 
with a trump, proclaiming, with a voice to be heard everywhere, the 
word of the Lord, but it did not come in that way, and when this scrip- 
ture was fulfilled through the prophet of the latter days, the people 
were no more ready to accept it than they were to accept the Christ as 
the Redeemer of the world. In each instance they were praying for, 
and looking forward to, the coming event, but in both instances re- 
jected it, because it did not come in the manner they expected and de- 
sired. 

i 

PERMANENT PEACE TO COME TO THE EARTH. 

The scripture which I read at the commencement of my remarks 
is a definite, positive statement, that peace will come to the earth, a 
peace which will be universal and permanent. Nation shall not lift up 
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. The 
manner in which this desired condition will be brought about, this con- 
dition for which all good men and women have prayed and waited, 
is not stated. It is urged by some that the nations will be so wasted, be- 
fore peace is established, that they will be without power to wage war. 
By others that peace cannot come until the people are all converted to 
the gospel, -and that this will not occur until after the coming of the 
Redeemer. For myself I do not know just how or when peace will 
be established upon the earth, but of this I feel certain, that it will never 
be established until the people want it, and are willing to establish and 
maintain it. If the time of its establishment is to be deferred, it will be 
because we reject the offer which is now made to us, for the Lord him- 
self cannot establish peace on earth, if the people are determined not 
to have it. I do not know whether it will be through the present 
league and covenant, or by some other means. It would be no more 
strange if it were accomplished through the present covenant than 
has been the accomplishment of the purposes to which I have referred, 
by the means which the Lord has used. 

THROUGH WHAT PLAN? 

I 

The world has just emerged from the most destructive, devasting 
war it has ever known, so far as we are aware. War-weary, the people 
are crying for some plan which will make a repetition of that through 
which we have just passed impossible. For the first time in our his- 
tory the strongest nations of the world have entered into a league, 
or covenant, by which it is hoped that peace may be established and 
maintained. It is said, as has always been said of every great for- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE,. 



ward movement, that the plan is not a good one, that it will not bring 
peace, but will be a fruitful source of discordand strife. It is urgea 
that some better plan may be found, that the time for peace has not 
yet come, that the Lord will accomplish what we are trying to do, if 
we will only wait and leave the matter to him. 

THROUGH ANY PLAN UPHELD BY A UNITED PEOPLE. 

I feel certain that no plan will succeed, no matter who is its 
author, or when it may come, to which the majority of the people are 
opposed. I am just as oertain that the present plan, or any other 
like unto it, will succeed beyond our fondest hopes, provided the peo- 
ple of the world will unite in a determined effort to establish and main- 
tain it. If the effort and energy which are being used to defeat the 
present league were united with the efforts of those who are seeking 
to establish and carry it into effect, there is no power that could stay 
it ; without the united effort, I fear that it will fail. I care not who 
is its author, whether its terms be those of the present covenant, or 
some other like unto it, there must be some such league, or covenant 
entered into between the peoples of the world, otherwise I can see 
only the mobilization of larger armies, the building of greater navies, 
the filling of war chests with gold, the means which Lucifer said he 
would use to dominate the earth, and war, war which will bring a 
carnival of bloodshed and suffering, compared with which the war 
just determined will be forgotten. 

PEACE WILL COME WHEN THE PEOPLE UNITEDLY W.ANT IT. 

When referring to this question before I have been accused of 
talking politics, of tricky word-building, by which I may fool the peo- 
ple. Can a congregation of Latter-day Saints be deceived by tricky 
word-building? I do not believe it possible. The sheep know the voice 
of the good shepherd, and a stranger they will not follow. I speak 
for no party, for no candidate, but for the Master whom I serve, to 
whom I have given my life's work, to whose words and works my 
conscience is a captive, who has admonished me to live at peace with 
all men, to raise the standard of peace, and maintain it in the world, 
and with his help I will continue to follow him, to be guided by his 
words and works, regardless of the opinions of men. He has always 
held out the hope of peace, he does so today. The people of the world 
can have peace now, as they might have had it long ago, if they want 
it, we must choose whether we will follow Christ, or Moloch; if the 
former blessed are we, if the latter woe is our lot. May the Lord 
inspire us to choose the better way, at this time when his wisdom 
is so indispensible, is my humble prayer. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the favorite hymn of President 
Lorenzo Snow : 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 



85 



Zion stands with hills surrounded — 

Zion, kept by power divine; 
All her foes shall be confounded, 
Though the world in arms combine; 
Happy Zion, 

What a favored lot is thine! 

Every hiiman tie may perish, 

Friend to friend unfaithful prove, 
Mothers cease their own to cherish, 

Heaven and earth at last remove; 
But no changes 

Can attend Jehovah's love. 

In the furnace God may prove thee, 

Thence to bring thee forth more bright, 
But can never cease to love thee, 

Thou art precious in His sight; 
God is with thee; 

Thou shalt triumph in His might. 

Elder Heber C. Austin, President of tjje Bingham stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The Conference was called to order at 2 o'clock by President 
Heber J. Grant, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Unuttered or expressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast. 

Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye, 

When none but God is near. 

Prayer is the simplest form of speech 

That infant lips can try; 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 

The majesty on high. 

Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air; 
His watchword at the gates of death; 

He enters heaven with prayer. 

Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice, 

Returning from his ways, 
While angels in their songs rejoice, 

And cry, "Behold, he prays!" 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The Saints in prayer appear as one 

In word and deed and mind, 
While with the Father and the Son 

Their fellowship they find. 

Nor prayer is made on earth alone; 

The Holy Spirit pleads, 
And Jesus on the Father's throne, ? 

For sinners intercedes. 

O thou by whom we come to God, 

The Life, the Truth, the Way! 
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod; 

Lord, teach us how to pray. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Arthur W. Horsley, of the Carbon 
stake, Price, Utah. 

The choir and congregation sang : 

Come, O Thou King of kings — • 

We've waited long for Thee — 
With healing in Thy wings, 
To set Thy people free. 
Come, Thou desire of nations, come, 
Let Israel now be gathered home. 

Come, make an end of sin, 

And cleanse the earth by fire, 
And righteousness bring in, 
That Saints may tune the lyre, 
With songs of joy, a happier strain, 
To welcome in Thy peaceful reign. 

Hosannas now shall sound 

From all the ransomed throng, 
And glory echo round, 
A new triumphal song; 
The wide expanse of heaven fill 
With anthems sweet from Zion's hill. 

Hail! Prince of Life and Peace! 

Thrice welcome to Thy throne! 
While all the chosen race 

Their Lord and Savior own. 
The heathen nations bow the knee, 
And every tongue sounds praise to Thee. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I shall follow the custom that has prevailed throughout the con- 
ference and read to you a few words from one of the revelations: 

These things we know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite 
and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, 
the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them; 

And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in 
his own likeness, created he them, 



EELDR JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 



87 



And he gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve 
him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being 
whom they should worship. 

But by the transgression of these holy laws, man became sensual and 
devilish, and became fallen man. 

Wherefore the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son, as it is 
written in those scriptures which have been given of him. 

He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto 1 them; 

He-was crucified, died, and rose again the third day; 

And ascended into heaven, to sit down on the right hand of the Father, 
to reign with almighty power according to the will of the Father, 

That as many as would believe and be baptized in his holy name, and 
endure in faith to the end, should be saved; 

Not only those who believed after he came in the meridian of time, in 
the flesh, but all those from the beginning, even as many as were before 
he came, who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as 
they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of 
him in all things, should have eternal life. 

As well as those who should come after, who should believe in the 
gifts and callings of God by the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the 
Father, and of the. Son; 

Which Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one God, infinite and eter- 
nal, without end. Amen. 

And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of 
Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on 
his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God. 

And we know that justification through the grace of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ, is just and true; 

And we know also, that sanctification through the grace of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, is just and true to all those who love and serve 
God with all their mights, minds, and strength. 

But there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart 
from the living God; 

Therefore let the Church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into 
temptation; 

Yea, and even let those who are sanctified take heed also. 

And we know that these things are true and according to the revela- ' 
tions of John, neither adding to, nor diminishing from the prophecy of his 
book, the Holy Scriptures, or the revelations of God, which shall come 
hereafter by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, the voice of God, 
or the ministering of angels. 

And the Lord God has spoken it; and honor, power, and glory, be ren- 
dered to his holy name, both now and ever. Amen. 

TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH OF THE QUOTED WORDS. 

When the brethren were speaking this morning my mind dwelt 
upon these verses which I have read and I have been greatly im- 
pressed by them and I trust that I may be led for a short time in 
bearing testimony and speaking, by the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord. I know that the words that I have read are true. I believe 
absolutely in the mission of the Lord and Savior of this world and as 
it is here expressed, I know that he came into the world, the only 
begotten Son of the Father, to fulfil this very mission which is here 
declared

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THE CHURCH TO PRAY ALWAYS A DAY OF WARNING. 

Now, the word that I desire to impress on your minds is this: 
"Therefore, let the Church take heed and pray always lest they fall 
into temptation." I have considered that it has been my mission, hav- 
ing been so impressed; I think, by the Spirit of the Lord in my travels 
in the stakes of Zion, to say unto the people that now is the day of re- 
pentance and to call upon the Latter-day Saints to remember their 
covenants, the promises they have made with the Lord, to keep his 
commandments, and follow the teachings and the instructions of the 
elders of Israel — the prophets of God — as they have been recorded in 
these holy scriptures. In all things we should walk humbly and cir- 
cumspectly before the Lord that we might be blessed and guided by 
his Holy Spirit. I think this is the day of warning. It has been a 
time of warning from the day when the prophet first received the man- 
ifestation from the heavens that the gospel was to be restored. Great 
events are about to take place among the saints of -God and likewise 
throughout the world. We are living in a very important day and the 
predictions of the prophets are being fulfilled. As it was expressed 
yesterday Zion has been established, an ensign has been raised in these 
mountains, and the call has gone forth unto all lands and unto all 
peoples, at least so far as we have had the opportunity to de- 
clare that word, calling upon them to repent, to turn unto the 
Lord, to come unto Zion where this standard is set up and 
serve him in righteousness. Israel has been gathered, and is being 
gathered, from among the nations, even all who will repent and hearken 
unto the commandments of the Lord, as they are set forth in these 
revelations. The Lord will save all who will hearken unto him. His 
arm is stretched out and he is willing to aid and to help and to lead 
all in righteousness and bring all to Zion who will come. Our 
mission in all the world, and also in the stakes of Zion, is, Repent ye, 
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It is necessary, even among 
the people who havefbeen gathered out of Babylon, to cry repent- 
ance, to call upon them to remember the Lord, to keep his covenants 
and commandments, and in all things endeavor to get possession 
of his Holy Spirit that they may walk in the light. 

THERE IS NEED OF REPENTANCE IN ZION. 

Let me not be misunderstood, when I say that there is need for 
repentance in Zion. I do not mean to say that the Latter-day Saints 
have gone "astray, that they have departed from the teachings which 
the Lord has given them, not that ; but that we are surrounded by the 
evils of the world, by temptations, by the sins of mankind, those things 
which prevail among the ungodly. There is constant need of warning, 
teaching and calling upon the people to remember the promises 
the Lord has made unto them ; urging them, to be true and faithful 
in all things, to his holy word that none may go astray, nor falter, or 



* 



' ' EELDR JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 89 

be overcome and trodden down and be cast back again into the world, 
to partake of the sins of the world from whence they came. And so I 
feel that it is my mission to cry repentance and to call upon the people 
to serve the Lord. 

THE-MOST POTENT FACTOR FOR PERMANENT PEACE. 

We have heard during- this conference a great deal in regard to 
the establishment of peace. We long for the day when Christ shall 
come and his kingdom shall be established in all the earth, when he 
shall set up his government upon the face of the earth. All of these 
things we hope and pray for, as we sang here this afternoon. The 
hymn that we sang this afternoon expresses my sentiment : 

Come, O thou King of kings — 

We've waited long for thee— 
With healing in thy wings, 

To set thy people free. 
Come, thou desire of nations, come, 
Let Israel now be gathered home. 

Come, make an end of sin, 

And cleanse the earth by fire, 
And righteousness bring in, 

That Saints may tune the lyre, 
With songs of joy, a happier strain, 
To welcome in thy peaceful reign. 

And this I pray for and this I hope for, and so do you. Now, 
may I ask you a question? Do you know what is the greatest power, 
the most potent factor in all the world, for the permanent establish- 
ment of peace in the earth? Having asked the question I will answer 
it, at least I will express my view jn regard to it — not saying anything 
about other movements. The greatest factor in all the world is the 
power of the Holy Priesthood, and that is in the possession of the 
Latter-day Saints. Right from the beginning the Lord sent out the 
elders into the world, commanding them to call upon the people, saying, 
Repent, come unto Zion. Believe in my gospel and you shall have 
peace. Peace will come, of course, through righteousness, through 
justice, through the mercy of God, through the power which he will 
grant unto us by which our hearts will be touched and we will have 
l©ve one for another. Now our duty is to declare these things amon'g 
all people, call upon them to come unto Zion where the standard is set 
up — the standard of peace — and to receive of the blessings of the 
house of the Lord and the influence of his Holy Spirit which is here 
manifest. And I want to tell you that we ourselves, if we will serve 
the Lord, have wonderful power in regard to the establishment of peace 
in the world. Now we are willing that other movements in this direc- 
tion should go on. We are in favor of all that will bring peace unto 
the world ; but let us not lose sight of the fact that we, Latter-day 



V 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

Saints, if we will band together, and stand as one serving the Lord 
and will send forth the word of eternal life among the nations, will 
have greater power, in my judgment, for the establishment of peace 
in the world than any other force. I am in full accord with the idea 
that has been expressed that the Lord is using many agencies ; his 
work is not confined to the Latter-day Saints, for he has called many 
to his service outside of the Church and has endowed them with power, 
has inspired them to do his work. All the great discoveries, the inven- 
tions, the great things that have taken place during the last three or 
four decades have all been in the direction of bringing to pass this 
reign of peace and righteousness in the earth. Do these men give 
credit to the Lord, these great discoverers — men who invent and bring 
to pass the Lord's work in this regard, do they give him credit ? Not 
in many instances ; and yet the Lord is using all of these agencies. 
However, my brethren and sisters, do not let us lose sight of the 
fact that we are a power in the earth for good and for the spread of 
the truth and the establishment of peface among all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and peoples, that must be considered. It has been upwards of 
eighty years that this gospel has been preached. It has gone into 
many lands. The people have been warned, not as fully, I grant you, 
as the Lord desires that they should be warned. Do the best that we 
can, we haven't the power in ourselves, of course, without the help of 
the Lord, to carry this word to every soul and to establish the truth as 
we would like to do it and as the Lord desires it to be done. He must 
call other agencies and put them to use to bring to pass his purposes, 
but our mission has been and is, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of God is 
at hand." 

We must continue until all the righteous are gathered out, until 
all men are warned, until those who will hear shall hear, and those who 
will not hear also shall hear, for the Lord has declared that there shall 
not be a.soul that shall not hear, not a heart that shall not be penetrated, 
for his word will go forth, whether it be the word of his elders or by 
some other means, it mattereth not, but in his due time he shall cut short 
his work in righteousness ; he shall establish his truth and he shall come 
and reign upon the earth. But woe unto the wicked, woe unto the un- 
godly, woe unto those who have heard the word and rebel against it, 
for in the due time of the Lord he shall come out of his hiding place 
and take vengeance upon all those who turn away and refuse to 
hearken, and after the testimony of the elders shall come the testimony 
of earthquakes, the testimony of famine, the testimony of pestilence 
and plague which shall spread forth. Of course, that does not prevent 
us from attempting to do all we can to lessen these evils, but the people 
will bring these things upon their heads, themselves, if they fail to 
hearken unto the words of the elders of Israel. I will read to you 
another passage of scripture: 

Again I say, hearken ye elders of my Church, whom I have appointed; 
ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach' the children of men the 
things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit; 



EELDR JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 



91 



And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye 
shall be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken. 

Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand. 

For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; 
the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremible, and the trump of God 
shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations, Ye 
saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again; 

Wherefore, gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked. 

Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, 
both old and young, both bond and free, saying, prepare yourselves for 
the great day of the Lord; 

For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to 
repent, arid ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the 
thunders shall titter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to 
the ears of all that live, saying, Repent, and prepare for the great day of 
the Lord; 

Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east 
unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make 
the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words, Repent ye, for 
the great day of the Lord is come. 

And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying, Hearken, 
O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you. 

O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you to- 
gether as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not? 

How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by 
the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of 
thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, . and by the voice of tempests, 
and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of 
famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, 
and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, 
and by the voice of glory, and honor, and the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with everlasting salvation, but ye would not? 

Behold the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indigna- 
tion is full. 

Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord 
your God. 

i 

Now these things are bound to come if the nations of the earth 
reject the counsel of God against themselves and turn against the 
Jruths which have 'been uttered from the heavens'. The word has 
gone forth and is being carried forth among them by the elders of 
Israel. Woe unto those who reject it. 

As it was stated by one of the speakers this morning, I am satisfied 
in my mind that peace could come right now if the people wanted it. 
Certainly. And I pray that they will want it. I want them to have 
it, because I love peace, and you want them to have it because you want 
peace, and we, as Latter-day Saints should pray for peace and we 
should live in peace and in harmony one with another and stand united 
together in all things serving the Lord. 

A PROMISE TO THE REPENTANT. 

I want to read just one more verse from another scripture. I 
would like to have the Latter-day Saints read this whole chapter. This 
is the 22nd Chapter of 1st Nephi. and there are a number of other 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



chapters connected with this that are of great import, but I want to 
read this one verse, the 28th: "But, behold, all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and people shall dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel, if it 
so be that they will repent." And I pray that they will repent. I want 
them to dwell safely. I want them to believe in the Holy One of 
Israel, who came into the world and atoned for our sins, for the sins 
of all mankind, who gave unto us redemption from death, who has 
promised unto us salvation and the remission of our sins on the con- 
dition of our repentance. 

O, I wish all mankind would believe in him, would worship him 
and his Father, and would serve the Lord our God in the name of the 
Son, and then peace would come, then righteousness would prevail, 
then the Lord could establish his kingdom upon the earth. He could 
do it now if all would repent, but when he gets ready to do it and should 
the people not repent, should they not turn unto him, then shall he 
come forth in his power and his might, as he has declared through his 
holy prophets ; he shall take vengeance upon the ungodly and they shall 
be swept off from' the face of the earth. He has decreed that un- 
righteousness shall not reign, that the wicked shall not slay the right- 
eous, but that peace shall come, that his kingdom shall be established, 
that this earth shall be made fit as an abiding place for all who are just 
and true, for those who love righteousness. That day is coming and 
I say to you, my brethren and sisters, it is even now at the door, but I 
do not know what may take place before the door is opened; but I 
know this' that it is timely for us to repent, if we need repentance, and 
turn unto the Lord. Remember him, forsake the things of Babylon 
and leave them unto those who love unrighteousness, and let us cleanse 
ourselves and set our houses in order. That is the will of the Lord. 
That has been his will from the beginning since his kingdom was set 
up, and he desires it now, and woe unto him who will not repent who 
_ is in Zion, for the Lord says that he will cleanse Zion and all things 
that offend shall be removed. When the time comes, when it is time 
for Zion to be cleansed, then that which offends, that which is unjust, 
that which is untrue, that which is false, that which breathes the spirit 
of contention and strife shall be removed, and Zion shall be redeemed, 
and the Lord shall watch over her, shall guide her, shall direct her and 
shall establish her and she shall never again be destroyed and her power 
shall not be given to other people. That I rejoice in. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let us serve the Lord, let us keep 
his comandments, let us be true, remember the things which the 
prophets have said. Follow the instructions they have given unto 
us. Heed the warning that has been declared by revelation through the 
servants of the Lord, both now and in times past and all will be well 
with us. Let us not sit down and feel in our hearts that all is well, that 
we can take our ease in Zion, that peace is here, that there is to be no 
more trouble, no more contention, no more strife no more war in the 
world. That we can not do in justice, but we must serve the Lord and 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



93 



we must keep his commandments, we must walk righteously before 
him as we have never done it before, and if we do not, then we shall be 
cut off from among the people and that would be a calamity. O, I pray 
that we will hearken, and that we will be true and faithful and stand in 
holy places, as we have been commanded to do, while the wrath of the 
Lord our God passes over the nations of the earth, and this- I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

August Glismeyer sang a sacred solo: "O Lord, What is man?" 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

To obviate unnecessary repetition I venture to say at the outset 
that I find myself in hearty accord with the utterances made by the 
First Presidency and by my brethren and associates in the Council of 
the Twelve, — and this without reservations. I commend to you for 
remembrance, frequent recollection, practice and application, all that 
has been said, all that has been set forth before you as the rule and 
the law of God and of the Church in regard to obedience to law, the 
instructions and counsel that have been given us concerning our specific 
duties as individuals, as members of families, as members of the 
Church, and as citizens of this great nation of promise and destiny. 

— TEMPORARY ISOLATION OF PEOPLES. 

As my mind runs back over the dealings of God with his people 
in different ages, I am struck with the thought that at times he has 
wisely separated and isolated a part of his family in the flesh for 
specific purposes. 

i 

Abraham's migration. 

You will remember that the word came to Abram, before he 
had been honored with that title of majesty among men, Abraham, 
by way of command specific and imperative : Get thee out, get thee 
out from the land of thy fathers, get thee out from these idolaters, 
and go into the land that I will show thee. And the Lord made coven- 
ant with Abraham that his posterity, should be numerous and withal 
blessed, that they should constitute a chosen and a covenant people. 
Blessings unnumbered and indescribable in their fulness, so far as 
man's powers of description go, were listed, if not depicted, all con--- 
ditioned upon compliance with the terms of their covenant or con- 
tract, and, like all other blessings promised of God, strictly predicated 
upon obedience on their part. 

Permit a moment's digression. The test of obedience c.onstitutes 
the very purpose of our being upon earth — the object in view in the 
creation of the earth as an abode for man, the great object that the 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord had in peopling the earth. Do you remember his words to Abra- 
ham after the decree had been made plain that there should be formed 
an earth upon which those then unembodied spirits should dwell? 
The explanation was in part given: "And we will prove them here- 
with to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God 
shall command them." That is the sum total of the test of the examin- 
ation under which every mortal has to pass in this great university of 
life. The Israel of old were" required to pass thatfiest, and promises 
were made unto them provided they passed it successfully. 

Israel's isolation in egypt. 

After a while the descendants of Abraham were carried down 
into Egypt, for the Lord turned and over-turned even the unfilial and 
unbrotherly conduct of Joseph's brethren to that end, and there the 
people remained segregated and isolated in large part, dwelling in a 
part of the land by themselves and kept from any widespread inter- 
mingling by marriage with the Egyptians because of the caste prejudice 
against them. They came to be slaves and bondsmen, and when the 
time came that was found to be right in the unerring mind of God, 
Israel was led out of the land of Egypt and out from the house of 
bondage by the outstretched hand of power. But they were even more 
completely isolated for four decades after that there in the wilderness, 
wandering back and forth, until the generation that had imbibed the 
paganism of Egypt had passed away and, with the exception of two 
individuals, a new generation had arisen and these were led into the 
land of promise, and .specific laws and commandments were given 
them that they should keep .themselves apart from the abominations 
of the other nations who were idolaters and pagans. 

In certain specific respects Israel was distinguished from all other 
nations of that time. In one matter for example, they were Sabbath 
observers, and they were the only nation under heaven that recognized 
the Sabbath; and that observance was a sign of distinction by which 
they were known. In the next place they were Jehovah worshipers, 
the only people known who worshiped other than idols. They wor- 
shiped the true and the living God and the Lord kept them, I was 
about to say so far as he was able, for they frustrated his designs and 
his plans in many respects, but he, kept them in a measure apart, iso- 
lated, separate from the rest of the nations in order that they might 
be more fully trained in the ways of God. But mark you, that isola- 
tion had an end so far as physical segregation was concerned- As 
was predicted and foretold, the time of dispersion came when those 
people were scattered as the dust that is blown before the wind, 
sifted as corn is sifted in a sieve. It was not the plan of God that 
they should remain forever isolated, for it was his intent that through 
them should the name of the living God be made known throughout 
the world.

LEHl's COLONY SEQUESTERED ON THE WESTERN CONTINENT. 

Come down a little later in history, si*c hundred years before 
the meridian of time, in the reign of Zedekiah, a body of Israelites was 
led away by the power of God and by direct intervention of divine 
agency brought across the great waters and established upon this 
then unknown continent, isolated from the rest of the world. The 
purpose of that separation, segregation, isolation and hiding was made 
plain. It provided a means whereby that part of the House of Israel 
should serve the Lord their God with purity and sincerity, so long 
as they would -remain obedient. They were to be uncontaminated by 
the fallacies of Scribes and Pharisees, their minds unpoisoned by the 
false doctrine of academical rabbis; they were led away so that they 
could be taught by the Teacher of teachers. Here they were kept and 
their history was a checkered one, but they were held together long 
enough to become a distinct unit, even as the Jews had been. For in 
spite of the separation of the Jews, notwithstanding their world-wide 
dispersion, they do constitute a distinct unit in the family of man- 
kind and they have preserved that segregation, which is other than 
physical isolation. It is true that the Nephi'tes were exterminated as 
a nation, but part of the posterity of Lehi has continued down to the 
present day. 

What was the purpose of it all — of that segregation of Lehi and 
his family and the establishment of those people upon this the western 
continent? The prime purpose was to provide an independent witness 
of the Christ. The Father would have more than the testimony of 
Judea and Galilee and the lands round about concerning his Well Be- 
loved Son, the Savior and Redeemer of the race. Therefore Lehi 
and his people were brought here, were taught in the ways of the Lord 
by direct revelation through the mouths of holy prophets. Part of the 
Lord's dealings has been written, and in a miraculous manner the 
record has been brought forth and given to the world. A new witness 
of the Christ ! People who knew nothing except as they did read 
what was then to them ancient history, that of Judea, of Galilee, of 
Jerusalem, knew nothing, except as they were taught by revelation ; 
and the revelation to them was specific and direct. Through their 
prophets they learned of the earthly life of Christ, his birth, his min- 
istry during the three short years, and his crucifixion. Later they 
were blessed by his personal visitation among them, and they have 
borne witness to him as the Savior, as the Redeemer ; and we have an 
entirely independent body of Scripture .which in no respects is at 
variance with the true part of the record that we find in the Holy 
Bible. 

THE SEPARATISTS. 

Prior to a great event, which had been foretold by ancient prophets 
—the coming of a man from among the Gentiles across the great waters 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and discovering this continent — there was another segregation upon 
a smaller scale, and this on the Eastern Continent.' Many who had 
suffered because of their religious beliefs separated themselves; some 
of them fled • from England . to Holland. They came to be known 
specifically as Separatists. Then, following that man of God — Colum- 
bus — for he was carrying out a divine purpose, the discoverer of the 
western world, came those other Gentiles of whom we read ; and they 
were brought to this land and here they found the remnant of Lehi's 
posterity who had formerly been established upon this continent. 

AMERICAN NATION ONCE ISOLATED NOW THE CHIEF OF MANY NATIONS. 

Now, hastening over centuries, we come to the time when an 
important segregation took place upon this continent. After the Church 
had been established through the instrumentality of the prophet Joseph 
Smith, the Lord led his people out, and others came from beyond the 
seas to join them. Because of persecution they were driven, liter- 
ally driven, beyond the frontiers of what was then the United States. 
They came here as a body, settled in this part of the desert, their in- 
spired leader utterly putting aside every suggestion that they should 
go on to the green pastures and the fat fields about the coast. Can 
you imagine what the result would be today had Brigham Young 
listened to the advice of those men, wise in their own knowledge? 
There never would have been, except the Lord had brought it about 
in another way, a unit such as this Church presents. Before the 
pioneers and those who came immediately after them could have been 
trained in the ways of God, their lands would have been invaded and 
they would again have become one with the people of the world. But 
the Lord kept them in this uninviting place, of which other people were 
mostly afraid until they, with whom were our worthy sires and moth- 
ers and grandparents, had been sufficiently trained to know that they 
had something in common which the rest of the world had not. But 
that physical segregation, isolation, separation was of comparatively 
short duration. When the Lord thought that the Latter-day Saints 
had learned the lesson, then he permitted others to come. It was not 
his intention to shut his people up within the walls of a building or 
within these valleys of the eternal hills, keeping them perpetually 
aloof from all the temptations of the world, for they had to be tried. 
In due time means of steam transportation were established and mul- 
titudes came, and have since been coming by the hosts every year, 
mingling with this people who are the covenant people of the last 
days. But in spite of this termination of physical separation, the 
people are a unit wherever you find them throughout the world. They 
are recognized by their distinctive characteristics. 

PREDICTIONS CONCERNING AMERICA AND HER PEOPLE. 

And now turn to the nation as a whole, the nation which I desig- 
nated — not by any means a designation original with me — as a nation 
of promise and destiny. As it grew it was isolated, isolated by the

deep on the east and the deep on the west ; and we "have boasted of our 
isolation, but that, like every other instance of segregation brought 
about by the hand of God, was not intended to be perpetual. -As a 
Church we are sending out, as we have been sending out from the 
first, men by the hundred as we could, by the thousand when it was 
possible, by the score when that was the limit of our ability, or by 
ones and twos, men, and in late years women, sending them out into 
the world. Does that look like perpetual isolation, physically speak- 
ing? And in the unfolding purposes of God the isolation of the nation 
has been brought to an end. Now no longer does the deep shut us 
off from other continents as once it did. We can speak on this side and 
be heard on the other with no appreciable lapse of time. Messages are 
sent to us from Europe and we read the published account here even, 
according to our reckoning of time, before the hour at which the 
events occur. No, no it was not intended that this nation should be 
forever shut off from the rest of the world. If we have anything 
better than the other nations have let us as Americans give it that the 
world may be made the better for it.^ That is the spirit of "Mormon" 
propaganda, that is the spirit of our missionary service, and it will be 
the spirit of the service that this nation shall render to the rest of the 
world. • 

In line with the excellent precedent set by my brethren, who have 
given you scripture after scripture, I desire to add another and I pray 
you read it more deliberately and more studiously than you may be 
able to listen to it in the brief time that I can give to its consideration. 
You may easily remember it. It is the first chapter of the Second Book 
of Nephi. Lehi, the prophet, stricken with years, trembling in limb 
and knowing that his days in the flesh had been numbered and that 
he was so_on to follow the way of his fathers, spoke unto his posterity 
who had then become numerous, respecting this particular land, the 
land of promise, the land of Zion, and he said unto them : 

Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, 
a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God 
hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. 
Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children for 
ever; and also all those who should be led out of other countries 
by the hand of the Lord. 

Mark you, I pray, the prophet knew that it was not to be a sel- 
fish inheritance, it was not to be kept forever solely for the habitation 
of his lineal descendants. It was to be for alb those who were then 
to be led out from other countries by the hand of the Lord. 

Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit 
which is in me, that there shall none come into this land, save they shall be 
brought by the hand of the Lord. 

Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. 
And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments 
which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, 
they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because

of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their 
sakes; but unto the righteous it shall be blessed for ever. 

And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet from 
the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations would overrun 
the land, that there would be. no place for an inheritance. 

But other nations were to come, not as nations, but as members 
of nations ; and they have come and are coming and shall come, le.d 
hither by the hand of the Lord. What, you say, these undesirable ele- 
ments? Well, they are permitted to be here that the people may be 
tried and tested and given the experience which is so necessary to' 
make them what the Lord intends that they shall be. And so let us 
not fear that our nation is going to lose its identity, or is going to 
lose its sovereignty or is going to be overwhelmed or overpowered 
by other nations. It can not be so save through iniquity. Well, you 
may say, are not the people of this nation iniquitous? It is true that 
sin befouls and defiles the land ; but in spite of* it, I know not where 
you will find a nation with higher ideals or with plainer purposes to 
uphold the institutions that God has established for the government 
and freedom of men. The Constitution of this land is the pattern 
after which the organic laws of other nations shall be framed, and 
thus has been already fulfilled in part the prophecy that out of Zion 
shall go forth the law ! 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS FEW BUT POWERFUL THROUGH DIVINE APPOINTMENT 

My brethren and sisters, we are a power in the world. The 
power of the priesthood is felt. What hath God wrought in his deal- 
ings with his people? Do you take time to consider how weak we 
are numerically speaking and yet how mighty we are in the strength 
of God. Look at the statistical compilations of churches that are pub- 
lished from time to time, summaries for the entire world or for this 
nation. Did you ever see there itemized the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, even under its nickname, "Mormon Church?" 
No, we are put in with "other small denominations" and so it is 
throughout the world. May I take time to relate an incident which has 
been a means of encouragement to me? 

A little over a year ago, I met by invitation in the east the editor 
of one of the most influential newspapers. Aside from his journalistic 
career he is known for achievements in literature. I was appointed 
to deliver an announced address, besides the expectation of speaking 
at other meetings of our conference in that city, the city of Boston, 
and the editor of this journal, in speaking with me beforehand, asked 
me some questions which I was pleased to answer. In an ordinary 
way he asked : "Will you please tell me what is about the total mem- 
bership of your great church?" 

And I answered him promptly : "Approximately 500,000." "But," 
he said, "I don't mean here in Massachusetts or in New England ; I 
mean what is the total membership?" "I have told you, Sir, about 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 



99 



half a million." "But, I mean," said he, "all of you throughout the 
world." "I have the same answer, approximately 500,000." He sat 
back in his chair and was lost in thought for a moment. He said: 
"Am I to understand you, literally that, this church which has made 
itself so well known," and he made other remarks of a descriptive 
nature, "numbers not more than a half million souls?" "It is true," 
said I. And then the Spirit of the Lord rested upon that man so that 
he had to testify of the miracle that God had wrought. Unconsciously 
he praised the Lord, for he remarked with all seriousness and sincerity : 
"The hand of the Lord is in it." Then he added : "You may have all 
the space you need in our paper to announce your conference and for 
tfie publication of the proceedings." 

In another city I had an experience very similar in some respects. 
It was in Baltimore. I arrived a couple of days ahead of the time fixed 
for our conference and' found that I had been advertized to deliver 
a specific address there. I met the editor of two papers, two papers 
under one editorial management, and he, like the other journalistic 
gentleman to whom I referred, asked questions concerning our strength 
and our numbers. He was a little doubtful as to whether a reporter 
could be spared to attend our meetings for their force had been cut 
down by the war demands, but at last he said : "What is the size of 
your congregation here in Baltimore ?" I said : "Twenty-seven." 
"Twenty-seven what?" "Twenty-seven souls, several of them chil- 
dren." "What, you have only twenty-seven?" "That is all according 
to the conference president's report, and if it would interest you, Sir, 
I can furnish you, with their names and addresses." "Twenty-seven," 
he said. Now perhaps you would naturally expect that his next 
remark would be : Why, we can not spare a reporter to look after 
a body of twenty-seven; we have no space in our paper for such a 
little thing as you are. But no, no, with deep seriousness upon his 
face he- said : "We will send a reporter and the paper will give the 
space you, need." 

So have I seen it time and time again. We can't boast of our 
numbers, we can't boast of our own strength, but we know that the 
strength of the living God is with this people, whether they be gath- 
ered or yet scattered, and his purposes concerning the Church estab- 
lished upon this land, the only land whose soil was suitable to the 
planting of such seed at the time of its establishment, shall not fail. 
He will see to it, for he has sworn so to do, that the Church shall not 
be overthrown. And as with the Church so with the nation of which we 
form a part. Aye, verily is the Lord working outside as well as within 
the Church, and other men than those who have gone down into the 
waters of baptism are his servants, working along specific lines. Re- 
member, beside the relative few, shall I say, beside those who shall at- 
. tain salvation, exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our God, we have to 
look after those other hosts who shall attain only the terrestrial glory. 
Their interests we must have at heart, and the interests of others, of all 
mankind, for our mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ

throughout the world and to warn the world by the authority and 
• power of the holy priesthood which the Lord has laid upon us. I pray 
for greater effectiveness in this labor and in the discharge of this high 
commission, in the name of Jesus Christ., Amen. 

"The Plains of Peace," a solo, was sung by Fern Batley. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

A month ago I was traveling in the green hills of New England. As 
I rode through that great country I was deeply interested and im- 
pressed with the historical scenes and with the points of much interest, 
to every American. 

A VISIT TO THE EAST. 

I remembered, as I traveled around near Boston, something of the 
history of the settlement of that country. I recalled that about three 
hundred years ago the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth, driven 
there by persecutions, and by intolerance, which they found to exist 
in the old world. I remembered with what hardship and self-sacrifice 
they had planted themselves in that part which is now the old part of 
the new world. There was recalled vividly to my mind and imagina- 
tion, some of the circumstances attendant upon the colonization of this 
new world by those who came here to find liberty and freedom. I had 
the opportunity of passing over the ground that was traversed, not only 
by the early Pilgrim fathers, but by those who were instrumental in 
initiating this great government that now prevails among the states of 
the Union. I stood upon Lexington Green where, I knew, more than 
a century arid a half ago, those Minute Men had stood to defend their 
rights and to give their lives for the principles of liberty and freedom, 
which they regarded as so important and so dear to them and to their 
people. As I stood upon this historic spot I thought something of the 
conditions which then prevailed as contrasted with the conditions 
which now prevail. 

MOMENTOUS PROBLEMS BEFORE THE NATION. 

I was in attendance upon the sessions of the American Bar Asso- 
ciation in Boston, when there were called to the attention of those pres- 
ent, many of the important problems which now confront the people. 
Men of prominence, men who have given themselves over to thought 
and study, admitted the perplexity of the situation. They confessed 
that the very foundations of civilization were threatened. They were 
willing to admit that the problems now confronting the nation and • 
the people were well-nigh beyond the power and wisdom of men to 
solve. 

While I was in the New England states the people of Boston 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



101 



were confronted with one of the most, if not the most, sorry specta- 
cle that has arisen in this nation during its history. During that period 
the men who were sworn to enforce the law in that great American 
city went on strike, disregarding their oaths of office. They refused 
to serve, and they turned the city over to> the whims .and caprices and 
outrages of mobs and mob violence. The commonwealth of Massa- 
chusetts, which has been the very cradle of American liberty, from 
which have come many of the best parts of the Constitution, many 
of the best laws that have been formulated, was disgraced by this 
outrage and by this failure of men to adhere to their oaths, to keep 
their covenants and to enforce the law. Everywhere men who stud- 
ied public conditions were disturbed. The honorable Elihu Root, 
speaking with reference to this occasion, said in substance, that it be- 
tokened a departure from American institutions and from the ob- 
servance of law, that threatened the very foundations of our civiliza- 
tion. Other men of prominence and of national repute considered 
it in like manner. 

Before I had reached New York City I learned, as we all know, 
that great forces were there on strike, and as I came back through the 
big cities of the country, having occasion to visit manufacturing and 
other institutions, I learned that the whole business world was up- 
set, disturbed, unable with any degree of certainty whatever to pre- 
dict as to the future, and wholly without any feeling of security as 
to that which might transpire. I recall going into one manufacturing 
establishment, consulting with the president of the company, and hear- 
ing him say that within the past six months his institution had been 
affected, directly or indirectly, by more than twenty-four strikes. It 
is needless to attempt to point out more of such difficulties and prob- 
lems which confront the people. 

HOW SHALL WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS? 

We have passed through a great war; we have met the prob- 
lems and the difficulties of that war, but I venture that any thought- 
ful man will be willing to admit that the problems which confront our 
people, after the war, are equally serious and important to those 
which came to us during the war. How are we going to meet these 
situations? What are we going to do here in America — this chosen 
land, of which you have heard many things said during the sessions 
of this conference? How are we going to preserve this land for the 
pure in heart? How may it be maintained as the land of Zion? How 
will it be possible that it shall live to its traditions and that it shall 
preserve the high principles of liberty and justice and equity upon 
which it has been founded ? These are among the questions that give 
us concern at this hour. Not only do they concern us as citizens of 
this great country, but they concern the whole world, because the 
whole world has come to look to this land, to foster the spirit of lib- 
erty and the principles and the cause which underly freedom and lib- 
erty among humanity.

REASONS FOR TURMOIL, DISLOYALTY AND UNREST. 

As we give consideration to these great questions we are forced, 
I think, to confess that the great statesmen of the world have not 
been able to find the remedies and have not been able to solve the 
problems. I believe that the conditions which we see prevalent in 
the country today are a natural and logical outgrowth of much that 
has prevailed in our systems of education, in our systems of ethics, 
and in the very manner in which the affairs of this country have, from 
time to time, been carried on. Throughout the past half century at 
least, our educational processes have been largely, if not entirely "de- 
void of anything pertaining to the divine, of anything pertaining to 
the spiritual, or anything pertaining to the truely religious. There 
has been a studied effort on the part of those who have controlled 
the educational systems of the day, to - avoid even the appearance of 
religion in any way, shape or form. I take it that there has come, as 
a natural consequence, from that kind of education, a total disregard 
for the religious in man's life. There has come an absolute disre- 
gard and disrespect for things divine. God has been left out of con- 
sideration; the methods of men alone have prevailed, and everywhere 
and under all conditions the things that have pertained to this world, 
the things that have pertained to our temporal life have been made 
paramount and have predominated over the things that have pertained 
to our souls and the welfare of our souls. In our politics, — I speak not 
of one party but of all of the great parties, there has grown up such 
a partisanship, such a bias, such a hatred, between those who espouse 
different causes, that things have been said, campaigns have been 
conducted in such a way and manner as to do away with, rather than 
to foster, the true spirit of national patriotism. Men and women who 
have belonged to political parties have been led to think that the great 
thing to be accomplished, the great end to be achieved, is the domin- 
ance of their own ideas, is the success of their own party, rather than 
the great welfare and common good of all. Indeed so much of antag- 
onism, so much of bias and envy and hatred have been engendered 
that I am one of those who believe that this has been largely responsi- 
ble for some of the great national crimes. There has come to be a 
total disregard for those in authority. There has grown up a dis- 
respect for law, that, in my judgment, has been the consequence of 
the kind of education, political and otherwise, that our people in 
this country have had. 

We as a people believe in honoring and sustaining the law. We 
recognize the absolute necessity of upholding the fundamental laws 
of our land if progress, if advancement, if the integrity of the nation 
itself are to be maintained. The evils of which society now most 
complains are the evils that result from the failure on the part of men 
to consider that they have any obligation to the law. They are a law 
unto themselves, as, was pointed out by Brother McKay. Their cov- 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



103 



enants, their compacts, their contracts are worthless. They keep them 
only when it is expedient to keep them. They subserve only their 
selfish interests. They have not been taught the fundamental neces- 
sity of obedience, to preserve not only the law of God, but the law of 
men. They have not been taught respect for person or property ; and 
such respect as has been yielded, in many cases, has only been the 
respect that has been enforced by external processes. There can never 
be a great citizenship that comes from the mere force, external force 
of law. You cannot superimpose the duties of citizenship in order to 
make a great people. The obligations of citizenship, the love of 
country and patriotism must come from within and not be imposed 
from without. Therefore, as I see it, the great need of the hour is 
the need for systematic training for men and women and children iii 
the fundamental obligations of citizenship and the fundamental obli- 
gations that pertain to their life in this world. The great questions — 
Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? have 
been left out of consideration in our educational processes. It has 
not made any difference who we were, where we came from, or where 
we are going. Our education has been a commercialized one. We 
have thought to stimulate the industrial, the financial, and to gain prest- 
ige from, a worldly standpoint. While, thank the Lord, there has re- 
mained in this great land, something of the spirit of the fathers, some- 
thing of the great love of liberty, unfortunately there has not been 
sufficient of it to curtail the selfishness, the mercinary and the ulterior 
motives. of a great part of this country. Therefore upon this funda- 
mental basis I deplore the organization and the maintainanoe of any 
society, of any class, of any fraternity, of any union of people that in 
anyway can be construed to be against the interests of all the people 
and the common good. For my own part the Church is my union, the 
Church is my club, the Church is my lodge; the Church is my fra- 
ternity ; and I want to say to every man that there is within the 
Church an opportunity for the expression of every legitimate desire 
that should be in the heart of man. While it may be considered 
proper for men to organize themselves into clubs and unions and fra- 
ternities of one kind and another in order to advance their own sel- 
fish interests, I feel constrained to say that in time to come it will 
prove inimical to the government, and in. time to come these self-same 
selfish interests will be against each other. The only way in which 
a great cause can stand and prevail and persist is that all its adher- 
ents shall have an unselfish, altruistic motive in seeking to render 
service to all and for all. Truth, the great principles of the gospel, 
the bestowal of the Priesthood itself, teach us that we must serve all 
and love all, if we shall succeed in God's work. 

SEEK NO ALLIANCE WITH ANY UNION THAT DOES NOT URGE 
THE COMMON GOOD OF ALL. 

My brethren and sisters, I- believe that it is a proper time to warn 
our people against the dangers that lie ahead, from associating them- 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



selves with any institution that does not make for the common good 
of humanity. I concur with my brethren that there are many insti- 
tutions in the world that do make for the uplift and the advancement 
of mankind; I believe that many of our Father's children who are 
without the- pale of the Church, are instrumental in carrying on his 
work. I cannot but think that he has let his Spirit rest upon good 
men, the world over, to advance the cause of Truth. It seems to me 
that it must be so. We, I believe, should unite with and foster every 
good ' movement, every good cause, everything that tends to advance 
the interests of the gospel and of truth in the world ; but I think that 
we should preserve ourselves safe, inviolate, compact against incur- 
sions of all kinds, of influences of all kinds of organizations that in any 
way will tend to disrupt us. If we all hang together we will be safe. 
If we all espouse the one cause, if we are all devoted to it, we will 
make that cause felt in the world. And the only way that we can all 
adhere uniformly to the great cause of truth is to all keep the com- 
mandments of God and to follow the leadership that has been placed 
over us. 

We have been criticized as being a people who act with such 
unanimity that we are mere puppets, that we do not think for our- 
selves, that we do not act upon our own initiative and that we are not 
guided by our own wisdom. That criticism is wholly without justifica- 
tion. We follow the leadership that God has placed over us, because 
we know that it is right, because we know that it is safe, because 
we know that the leadership of men, in man's own wisdom, is not safe 
and cannot be trusted, and that we cannot repose our confidence in 
the wisdom of men. 

LET LATTER-DAY SAINTS FOLLOW THEIR LEADERSHIP. 

1 call upon the people of this Church to follow the leadership 
of these men who have been set to preside over them, in their wards 
and in their stakes. I know that you will not go wrong if you take 
their counsel. I know that you will be preserved from the dangers, 
the temptations, the evils and snares of this world if you will follow 
their leadership. They are true leaders; they have no ulterior mo- 
tives to subserve, nor selfish purposes to subserve. They seek only 
your welfare, and I deplore .the fact that occasionally we find those 
within the Church who impugn improper motives to the men who lead 
and guide. I want further to testify to you that it is God's truth 
that the general authorities who preside over you and over the 
Church have nothing but your welfare at heart. They have no per- 
sonal purposes to subserve. Their only thought, their one single pur- 
pose, is to advance God's work in the world. They love the Latter- 
day Saints. I believe that there is not one of them who would not be 
perfectly willing to lay down his life for the Church, to advance this 
great work and to help carry the Truth into the hearts of men. Do 
not criticise, do not complain on that score. It is wrong; and the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 105 



man who says that the leaders of the Church are not actuated by the 
finest and the highest motives, I fear, has within himself a sinister 
motive that prompts such a statement. 

God bless our people that we may be a shining light to this world. 
Here, right here in the valleys of the mountains, I have concluded 
is the cradle of liberty. I am willing to grant to Massachusetts all 
the credit that is due her for the great effort that she has made to 
bring freedom to mankind; but I say right here, with God's people, 
is the real cradle of liberty. I have reached the conclusion that there 
is only one perfect law of liberty, and that is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I know that all the systems that may be devised, all of the 
governments that can be constructed, will not bring liberty to man- 
kind if the true principles of liberty are not in the hearts of the peo- 
ple. The thing that the world needs today is individual righteous- 
ness, and if men and women will conform their lives to the principles 
of the Gospel, if they will, as has been said, be vitalized by these great 
principles of truth, the problems of the world will melt away, peace 
will come, the Lord will find his people ready for his reign, and the 
Millennium will be upon us. God bless us, that as the salt of the earth 
we may not lose our savor, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

It was announced by President Heber J. Grant, that on Sunday 
at 10 a. m. and 2 p. m. there would be overflow meetings in the As- 
sembly Hall, and at 2 p. m. also in Barratt Hall. The General Priest- 
hood meeting, it was announced, would meet at 7 o'clock in the Tab- 
ernacle this evening. Richards ward choir will furnish music for 
the meetings in the Assembly Hall, and the L. D. S. University choir 
for the meeting in Barratt Hall. 

The choir and congregation sang: "Guide us, O thou great 
Jehovah." 

President Alonzo A. Hinckley, of the Deseret 'stake of Zion of- 
fered the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the Tabernacle, Sunday, October 5, 1919, 
10 o'clock a. m., President Heber J. Grant, presiding. 

Every available sitting and standing space was filled in the great 
building, the main floor being almost entirely occupied by presiding 
officers assembled from all parts of the Church. 

President Heber J. Grant called the congregation to order. 

The Tabernacle choir, led by Elder George Careless, former di- 
rector, now over eighty years of age, sang the hymn : 

Arise, O glorious Zion, 

Thou joy of latter days. 
Whom countless Saints rely on, 

To gain a resting place; 
Arise, 'and shine in splendor, 

Amid the .world's deep night; 
For God, thy sure defender, 

Is now thy life and light. 

Let faithful Saints be rearing 

The city of our Lord, 
On mountain tops appearing, 

According to His word — 
A sought-out habitation, 

By men of truth and faith — 
A covert of salvation 

From ignorance and death. 

The Temple long expected , 

Shall stand on Zion's hill, 
By willing hearts erected, 

Who love Jehovah's will; 
Let earth, her wealth bestowing, 

Adorn His holy seat, 
For nations great shall flow in, 

To worship at His feet. 



What though the world in malice 

Despise these mighty things, 
We'll build the Royal Palace, 

To serve the King of kings; 
Where holy men anointed 

To know His sovereign will, 
Each ordinance appointed 

To save us, will reveal. 

From Zion's favored dwelling 
The Gospel issues forth, 

The covenant revealing 
To gather all the earth; 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



107 



And Saints, the message bringing 

To all the sons of men, 
With the redeemed, shall, sing ng, 

To Zion come again. 

O hear the proclamation, 

And fly as on the wind! 
For righteous indignation 

Shall desolate mankind! 
Then, Zion, men shall prize thee, 

And bow before thy shrine; 
And they who now despise thee 

Shall own thy light divine. - 

Through painful tribulation 

We walk the narrow road, 
And battle with temptation, 

To gain that blest abode; 
But patient, firm endurance, 

With glory in our view — 
The Spirit's bright assurance — 

Will bring us conq'rors through. 

O grant, Eternal Father, 

That we may faithful be, 
With all the just to gather, 

And Thy salvation see! 
Then, with the hosts of heaven, 

We'll sing the immortal theme — 
To Him be glory given. 

Whose blood did us redeem. 

Prayer was offered by Elder James H. Robinson, president of 
the South Davis Stake of Zion. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the first hymn, words by Parley P. 
Pratt and music by Evan Stephens. President Grant first read the 
whole hymn : 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 

Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

The clouds of error disappear 

Before the rays of truth divine; 
The glory, bursting from afar, 

Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 

The Gentile fullness now comes in, 
And Israel's blessings are at hand; 

Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin, 
Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

Jehovah speaks! let earth give ear, 
And Gentile nations turn and live; 

His mighty arm is making bare, 
His covenant people to receive.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Angels from heaven, and truth from earth 
Have met, and both have record borne; 

Thus Zion's light is bursting forth. 
To bring her ransomed children home. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I have never desired more to have my words inspired than I do 
now. I am fond of the Latter-day Saints. My heart is full of love for 
the people among whom I was born and with whom I have been raised. 
In the years in which I have been separated from the Church, largely 
in attendance at eastern universities, I have thought of my people here 
with very great fondness, and have confidently felt that all the good 
ideas there learned, if properly presented to my own people here, would 
be accepted promptly by them.

AN APPEAL FOR PURE WATER. 

At Cornell University I devoted a great deal of time to the study 
of sanitary engineering. As I listened to the teachings of college pro- 
fessors I was amazed that the lives of our people have been so well 
preserved under unsanitary conditions. When I came from that in- 
stitution the sun had not gone down on the first day of my arrival 
until I had called together, in one of our "Mormon" villages, the officials 
of the city and appealed to them that they provide the people with 
pure water. I am pleased to be able to say the appeal was not made 
in vain. Nor have I since in religious services, before meetings of 
commercial clubs or other organizations, appealed to any of our peo- 
ple along these lines without success. 

WE ACCEPT TRUTH FROM EVERY SOURCE. 

This is one reason among many why I have great confidence in 
you, my own people. We believe in accepting truth, from whatever 
source it comes. If there is anything virtuous, honest, upright, holy, 
good, and true, we, in accordance with the fundamental principles of 
the gospel, seek after these things. 

A GENUINE LOVE OF AND INTEREST IN AMERICA. 

I regard myself as a pretty good American. My ancestors have 
been Americans. I met a man from Canada a few days ago, an en- 
gineer, whose name is Lyman. I received a letter from him only yes- 
terday in which he sent me a long list of ancestors. He points with 
pride to their record. Since 1630, the Lymans have been active in 
„ their support of this great country. It has had no important war in 
which Lymans have not fought, in which Lymans have not bled, in 
which Lymans have not died for their country.

I see before me now, especially in these front seats, many stake 
presidents with whom I have had very intimate, friendly, affectionate 
association. I wonder if at this hour I may properly attribute to them 
what I attribute to myself, that is, a genuine love of and interest in 
America ? 

Some men who are here talked with me months ago upon the 
subject concerning which I desire to make a few remarks today. Upon 
this subject, their views and mine differ. Iextend to them the liberty of 
thinking as their consciences direct, and I desire to be accorded the 
same privilege. I have greater respect for the man who expresses 
his honest convictions when he is with the minority than I have for 
the man whose desire, it seems, is primarily to be with the majority. 
American freedom, American liberty and American institutions can 
only endure indefinitely, if I understand the fundamentals of Ameri- 
can government, if every man, in the language of Abraham Lincoln, 
dares to the end to do his duty as he understands it. These men be- 
fore me who conscientiously are opposed to the League of Nations, I 
admire. I respect them for their true Americanism. Such as these 
will make the republic of America endure indefinitely, if indefinitely it 
is to endure. 

POSITION ON THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 

Some may say I speak here with an unfair advantage, since others 
have no opportunity to reply. But I say, as a leader in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I cannot, at this conference, do my 
duty, as I understand it, if I keep my lips closed upon a subject that, to 
my mind, has more to do with the welfare of all the nations of the 
world than any other subject that has come before the American peo- 
ple since the Constitution was adopted. So I say frankly, brethren, 
come, let us for a moment reason together. I now speak upon this 
subject, in public, for the first time. I have hesitated to do this be- 
cause my views do not agree with those of my life-long friend, the 
Honorable Reed Smoot, whom I have admired since childhood. But 
I know this broad-minded statesman well enough to realize that he 
will have greater respect for me if I speak than he could have if, with 
my convictions, I were to remain silent. 

I have studied the covenant of the League of Nations with con- 
siderable care. One objection raised against it is that the people of 
Europe, not familiar with our ideals, and not concerned in the wel- 
fare of our country, are given authority to say when we shall and 
when we shall not go to war. I am not able to read this meaning into 
the proposed covenant of the League. The covenant provides for 
two bodies of representatives, one is called the assembly and the other 
the council. In the council there will be but nine countries represented. 
Each country in that council is to have one vote. Action can be taken 
by the council only with a unanimous vote. Suppose the proposition 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is presented of declaring war. The man who represents the United 
States of America in the council, if asked to vote, must say in substance : 
"Gentlemen, under the Constitution of my country, only the Congress 
of the United States has the authority to declare war. I must, there- 
fore, be instructed by the Congress of the United States before I can 
cast my vote." Thus will this cherished provision of our inspired Con- 
stitution remain inviolate. 

SUCCESS OF THE PAN-AMERICAN UNION. 

I was in Kansas City a week ago yesterday. I listened to an 
address by John Barrett, the Director General of the Pan-American 
Union. I believe this gentleman is a Republican. If I remember 
correctly, he came into political life when he was a comparatively 
young man by receiving from President Roosevelt the appointment 
of Ambassador to Siam. 

Before the International Farm Congress, Mr. Barrett said: "I 
desire to make it clear at the outset, that while I represent the gov- 
ernment of the United States, by appointment from the President, 
I also stand before you as a representative of the same sort for all 
of the other American countries that belong to this Union." 

All the countries in the Western Hemisphere, south of Canada, 
twenty-one in number, belong to the Pan-American Union. The 
Canadians were practically in readiness, so this representative said, 
to join the Pan-Arnerican Union when war was declared and the • 
plans for so doing were temporarily upset. 

Mr. Barrett continued to speak in words like these : "We 
have regular meetings of the representatives of these twenty-one 
countries. When these representatives come together, they become 
acquainted, and thus they learn to understand one another. They pre- 
sent the views, the ideals, the desires, the ambitions, the trade and 
other interests of their respective countries. Getting thus close to- 
gether, they arrive at a mutual understanding." 

He continued, "The significant fact I desire to draw to your at- 
tention is that, since the organization of the Pan-American Union, no 
country in the Western Hemisphere has been at war with another 
country in this hemisphere and on not fewer han six different occa- 
sions has actual war between these countries been averted." 

"Here in our own hemisphere," he continued, "we have a League 
of Nations in actual operation and I'm not sure but what this Pan- 
American Union is itself a league strong enough to maintain the peace 
of the world." If one so well informed sees such hope for peace be- 
cause of the successful operation of this comparatively little league of 
the Pan-American Union, how much greater — really how well founded 
— is the hope, the expectation, that permanent peace may come to the 
world if the proposed covenant of the League of Nations embracing, 
as it does, the great nations of the other hemisphere, is adopted.

FIRM FOR THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. 

I would be untrue to the blood that flows in my veins, I would 
be untrue to that father of mine, Francis M. Lyman, who was 1 a lover 
of liberty, who, in all his lifetime hoped and prayed earnestly for the 
nations of the world to so organize that bloodshed might be averted, — 
I say I would be untrue to all of these, if I were to refrain from speak- 
ing in the interest of this proposed covenant. Francis M. Lyman 
was not a coward. He was never afraid, and in his public hopes, 
desires, and works, I defy any one to find an element of personal sel- 
fishness. Were I to stand before this audience today, his son, and 
keep my lips closed, I would be an unworthy son of a brave and cour- 
ageous sire, who lived and worked and hoped for the liberty of all 
the people of the world. 

After war was declared, in 1914, he said repeatedly, "We must 
do one of two things, either put on the Kaiser's yoke or bring him 
beaten to his knees, however long it takes and however much it costs." 
If Francis M. Lyman were here today to speak as he has spoken 
many times, on occasions like this, he would say as I say now: "I am 
prepared to do my duty as I understand it and I accord to others 
the same privilege. Let me make it clear that I stand firmly for the 
League of Nations. In the days to come I expect to see no time in 
which I shall regret having taken this stand." 

AN APPEAL TO ABANDON THE USE OF TOBACCO. 

One other word and I will stop. We have had, this morning, 
a thrilling meeting of Mutual Improvement officers. I should like, 
if I had the time, to say a few words upon the slogan of our organ- 
ization, namely, "We stand for spiritual growth through attendance 
at sacrament meetings," but time will permit me to do no more than 
repeat it. 

During the war the habit of smoking has been tremendously in- 
creased. We are aiming to have a survey made in every stake, and 
ward, for the purpose of finding out how many smokers there are, 
and we propose to use our organization for the purpose of reducing this 
habit to the least possible minimum. I think I can do nothing that will 
emphasize the importance of this subject more than to deliver here 
and now a message that was sent to you by me some' years ago from 
Cornell University. 

The message is from Andrew D. White. This man for years 
was a professor in the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, he 
was for a long period President of Cornell University, and he served 
our country as ambassador to Germany. His name is among the names 
of the great historians of our country. Andrew D. White, standing 
before a body of teachers, said : 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I cannot refrain, ladies and gentlemen, from making a few preliminary 
remarks before beginning my address proper. I understand that there are 
before me teachers from every state in the Union and from almost all the 
countries of the world and, therefore, I cannot let this opportunity go 'by 
to say that I want to go back into your communities and take to the 
people with whom you are associated a message from Andrew D. White. 
That message is this: In my fifty years of experience with college students, 
with college n>en, I have yet to find the first young man who was a smoker 
of cigarettes that ever amounted to anything. 

His view and my view or your view of what it means to amount 
to something may be different, but those were his words. He con- 
tinued : 

i 

As I walk across this campus, this wonderful Cornell University campus, 
and see young men puffing at their cigarettes, I don't care how much money 
they have, I don't care what their prospects are, I don't care what their 
social standing is, I don't care who their parents are, I say to myself, they 
will not amount to more than .that — and he snapped his fingers. 

As I have already stated, I came from Cornell University, filled 
with enthusiasm and confidence in my own people. I appealed to the 
people of Utah and nearby states, to provide themselves with pure 
water. They responded promptly with the improvements. I was the 
Stake Supervisor of parents classes in the Ensign stake when this 
matter of individual sacrament service sets was proposed. The appeal 
was made to the people to provide themselves with these sets, and 
today they are found practically everywhere in the Church. 

Now, as one of the General Superintendency of the Young Men's, 
Mutual Improvement Associations, I appeal to you, fathers and rao- 
ers, leaders in the Church, to join the Mutual Improvement workers 
in an effort to reduce to the least possible minimum, the use of the 
cigarette. The laws of the state are against it. It is a misdemeanor for 
any individual to sell or to give any kind of tobacco to any boy under 
twenty-one years of age. 

I have before me the Word of Wisdom. If, standing, as I am 
before this audience, I were to say: "I have a method to present by 
which all the young men in the Church may become rich in money," 
every ear would be turned my way to learn the method. But, is it 
not better to have the .ability to make the money than it is to 
have the money itself ? Who would not rather have a fortune he him- 
self has acquired than to possess one that has been accumulated by 
another? This Word of Wisdom tells us how to become rich. Rich 
in money? Yes; rich in money. It says: no liquor, no tobacco, little 
meat, no hot drinks, and then it concludes : "All Saints who remember 
to keep and to do these things, walking in obedience to the command- 
ments, shall find" — what? Wealth- No, but three things that mean 
more than wealth alone. They shall receive first, health, they shall 
find, next, v/isdom ; and they shall find, third, great treasures of knowl- 
edge, yea hidden treasures. They shall run and' not be weary, they 
shall walk and not faint. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. ' 113 



This, my brethren and sisters, is a subject upon which we have 
no division of opinion. Let us refrain from the use of these things 
forbidden that we may have health, wisdom, and knowledge, the three 
blessings promised, these together being equal to much more than 
wealth alone. By keeping these commandments, we shall deserve the 
closing blessing in the revelation, namely, "I, the Lord, give unto them 
a promise that the destroying angel shall pass, them by as the children 
of Israel and shall not slay them." 

May our Father in heaven enable us to so teach, so lead, so guide, 
and so direct our boys and girls that all the great and wonderful prom- 
ises made concerning the pure in heart may be theirs and ours. I 
pray earnestly for these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen.

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that 
I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto every people; 

"Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance, and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come 
unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of 
the earth. 

"But behold I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be 
content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow uo in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether 
it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, ac- 
cording to their will; whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; or he 
that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good 
and evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he desireth 
good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than 
to perform the work to which Lhave been called? ' 

"Why should I desire that I was an angel, that I could speak unto all 
the ends of the earth? 

"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation 
and tongue, to teach his word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that 
they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, 
according to that which is just and true." 

IN ACCORD WITH THE BRETHREN. 

These words from Alma, 29th chapter, express my feelings this 
morning, my brethren and sisters, and I am happy to say that I find 
myself in complete accord and harmsny with my brethren, each and 
every one who have spoken at the various sessions of this conference. 
And I desire to emphasize the fact that those of you who have had the 
gift of discernment have distinguished no difference of opinion among 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who have addressed you. While they have emphasized various 
features of the great gospel message and of the questions of the hour, 
yet we stand in accord with each other on these subjects, for which I 
am thankful. I believe, brethren and sisters, that the Lord saw our 
clay and that we have been preparing for this day for more than a 
generation past, that the Lord knew the various circumstances and 
conditions that would confront us in this hour, and he has been try- 
ing to fortify us and qualify us to meet the emergency, to endure the 
test that now lies before us. The Church has been subject to criticism, 
in the past, because of its unity, because of the willingness on the part 
of the membership of the Church to listen to the counsels of its lead- 
ers. I remember upon one occasion listening to a very severe criticism 
of the Church on the part of an eminent divine who charged that while 
we were the most perfect religious organization in the world, he feared 
the consequence because he said the membership of the Church is ab- 
solutely under the control and the domination of its leaders. I recall 
also that another one expressed it that the two most efficient organiza- 
tions in the world were the German army and the "Mormon" Church, 
and he hoped that he would see the day when we would have equal 
efficiency and still retain individual liberty. 

OBTAINING . EFFICIENCY AND OBEDIENCE. 

There are two ways of obtaining obedience and efficiency. The 
Germany army had one, and the "Mormon" Church has quite another. 
The Lord Jesus Christ had a plan, to bring all men to obedience ; and 
Constantine, the great Roman Emperor had quite another plan. There 
are two means by which obedience may be obtained on the part of 
parents over their children. One is by force and compulsion. You 
may compel them to yield obedience. That method will work until 
your child becomes a man or a woman, and then your spell is broken, 
your power is gone. The other method is slower to obtain results, but 
it endures longer, and obedience is obtained through the exercise of love 
and patience and gentleness and kindness. By and through that means 
parents may have power over their children, not only until they become 
men and women, but when they become grand-sires and in the eternal 
world the spell that we cast ovevr those who come under our charge, 
when it is actuated by the spirit of love and gentleness and mercy, shall 
never be broken. These are the two methods. The German army did ob- 
tain obedience and efficiency by force, by fear, by power, until men felt 
themselves but slaves- Do you recall the utterance of their master- 
tyrant who upon one occasion, — about the time, as I recall it, of the 
breaking forth of the great world war, said to his soldiers : "Body and 
soul, you belong to me, and if, I should command you to slay your 
own fathers and mothers you should do it without a murmur." This 
power he held until those whom he controlled discovered their own 
power and their own strength. Then they resented that autocratic 
power that had ruled unjustly over them and in the finality of the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



115 



great struggle, when Germany sought to drive her soldiers on to 
France, they were under the necessity of forcing their own men into 
the trenches at the point of the bayonet, and many were shot down 
by their own guns because they refused the mandate of the tyrant. 
But when they broke the spell the tyrant's power departed and he, like 
a whipped coward, fled from his own land, and there is apparently no 
respect now for that power which he once had. Unlike that .stands the 
spirit that actuated the Christ. He did have power, if he had desired 
to use that power — he might have through fear, he might have through 
miracle, converted all the world and had all men at his feet, but he 
would not compel men. He did, as we sing: "Call, persuade, direct 
aright, in numerous ways be good and kind, but never force the human 
mind." He did teach the truth, in striking contrast to his envious, 
coveteous brother who sought by force to compel all men to be saved. 
Jesus stood for those same principles while upon the earth, but he 
did not succeed in getting many to follow him. Contrast his min- 
istry with the efforts of the great Roman emperor Constantine, who 
years later was seized with the desire to compel the nations of the 
world to become Christians and who pursued a method of force. When 
the Roman soldiers conquered a nation, the priests of the Church ac- 
companied them, and when the conquered and subdued sued for peace 
they were granted peace on condition that they would renounce their 
paganism and become Christians, and so out of fear they gave lip ser- 
vice to their professions of Christianity, but their hearts never were 
in it. And no .wonder the Lord Jesus Christ said of their descendants, 
many generatons afterwards, "they draw near me with their lips, but 
their hearts are .far removed from me." Their fathers were thus con- 
verted, and traditionally they have adopted that form of Christianity 
which gives only lip service. The Lord Jesus knew them well. In 
contrast with that method, I rejoice to say that the leadership of this 
Church is in absolute harmony with the method of the Christ. 

THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCH DIRECTED BY LOVE 

NOT FORCE NOR FEAR. 

President Grant read to us in the opening session of this con- 
ference that wonderful revelation, the 121st Section of the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, showing the spirit that should be manifest by 
the priesthood of this Church, and he has pledged us his word, as he 
did when in the last conference in June he also referred to this sub- 
ject, that so far as his presidency was concerned it would be char- 
acterized by that spirit. I want to ask you, my brethren and sisters, 
if you have ever felt in all the administrations that you can remember 
that the membership of this Church bowed their will to the leadership 
of this Church out of fear. I haven't felt that way. I know you have 
not. There have been times, undoubtedly, when it has not been easy 
for us to submit our will to the will and the judgment of those who 
have presided over us. We have found it sometimes difficult to sub- 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mit our proud will. I am grateful to say before you, my brethren and 
sisters, that while there have been such periods in my life I am very 
happy to say that I have always been able to make my proud will sub- 
mit itself to the influences of the mellowing processes of the Spirit of 
the living God, so that I have found myself, up until this time, in har- 
mony with those who have been leading and directing the policy of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I remember that 
the editor of a newspaper up in Vancouver, British Columbia, a few 
years ago, urged the "Mormon" missionaries to leave that community 
and go to European countries as the missionaries of the Church had 
done in former times and "engage in converting the poor, taking them 
out to Utah and Idaho, putting them on the farms, compelling them 
to till the soil and then extract from them ten per cent of their earn- 
ings for tithing from which the Church has become rich. Don't come 
to this country and think you can fool us." That was the advice given ; 
and in the answer that was made,^which the editor was broad enough 
to publish, — we said it was true that in times past many people had 
been emigrated from the lands of their nativity and brought out from 
bondage — conditions almost amounting to serfdom, and had been as- 
sisted to come to the land of America, and the Church had helped them 
to found and establish themselves in homes where they became inde- 
pendent ; that the Church had helped them to get the lands, had helped 
them to till the soil, had builded irrigation ditches, had assisted in 
building reservoirs, manufacturing enterprises, and educational insti- 
tutions, until Utah stood, as I think it still stands, second _in the matter 
of its high standing in education among the states and far ahead of 
British Columbia. We also said that the people had so prospered and 
been so blessed that, at that time, something like ninety per cent of 
them owned their own homes. A like condition could not be found 
anywhere in the world ; and while it is true that they did pay their tith- 
ing, they did it cheerfully, not out of fear, but out of love and grati- 
tude to God that they had been alleviated from their former conditions 
where in old age they would have had to go to the poor house, never 
had their ancestors before them enjoyed homes of their own; and so, 
because of what had been done in a material way for their improvement 
and betterment, they cheerfully paid their tithing. But there was one 
point that the editor overlooked. If ten per cent of their earnings had 
made "the Church rich," what had the 90 per cent, that was left done 
for the poor fellows? It left them in this favored condition. 

Now, brethren and sisters, the leadership of this Church from the 
beginning until this day has been maintained, not by fear or by force. 
It was presumed that the prophet Joseph Smith had some magical 
power over his brethren and sisters ; that if he could only be disposed 
of, then the "Mormon" Church would go to pieces, but his death did 
not result in the disintegration of the Church. And when I think of 
him, O, there are no people in the world that ever thought so much of 
their leader! Not even the Master himself had a people who loved 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



117 



him better than the Latter-day Saints loved their Prophet Joseph 
Smith. But with all the love the people had for him, he never abused 
their confidence, he never took advantage of them like others have 
done who enriched themselves because of their opportunity. He died, 
one of the poorest in the flock, and always was on the front ready to 
defend them, standing between them and danger. Chained in a dung- 
eon, as a ransom for his people, he did not waver ; but through all their 
vicissitudes he was their hope, their inspiration, their prophet; and 
when in the Jast moments of his earthly career he stepped to that open 
window, knowing that outside there were many willing to take his 
life, he, unafraid offered his life— the very last act — in saving two of 
his brethren. So that spirit of service and self-sacrifice and devotion 
to the people won the obedience that was manifest in that day to- 
wards the Prophet Joseph Smith. - The same thing was true with 
President Young. Do you remember when the Prophet Joseph was 
condemned to death, and the order had been issued that he was to be 
executed, that the one who came with the information harangued the 
Latter-day Saints and advised them to disband and godlike other peo- 
ple, without an organization and scatter through the world. The 
answer that President Brigham Young gave was : "We shall not 
disband;" and he entered into covenant with his brethren and sisters 
that they would not desert the poorest Latter-day Saints and leave 
them in Missouri. So he always had at heart the welfare of the 
common people, and that has been true of every leader until this day. 

COUNSEL IN REGARD TO LABOR AND UNIONS. 

No wonder the Latter-day Saints love their leaders. No wonder 
they can trust them. They have always been the true shepherds of 
the flock. They have never deceived their people, nor led them astray ; 
and when the leaders of this Church counsel our brethren and sisters not 
to be built up with the hope that outside of this Church they shall 
solve the problems between capital and labor by joining unions, by 
joining the non-partisan league, by joining socialism, it is not that they 
desire to curtail the liberties of the people. It is because they love all 
the people. This Church has had an interest in those who have pos- 
sessed means, that they should have justice and their rights. Sometimes 
it has been charged that the Church rather favors capitalism. I have 
never discovered it. If you will search the records, you will discover 
that more means has been spent for the farmers, for the common peo- 
ple in the Church than for any other class in the days of President 
Young. We, today, recognize, as they did, that the very foundation of 
the Church depends upon the success of the tillers of the soil, the 
workers, and our interest is for them, and yet we do not become, sel- 
fish nor sordid to join with one group of laborers against the interests 
of all others. They must stand on a broader platform. The solution 
of the questions that we have been discussing shall never be accom- 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



plished, and the difficulties removed between the workers, until every 
worker becomes his brother's keeper, interested in his brother's wel- 
fare. Until men shall recognize the rights and the privileges and' the 
liberties and the welfare of all classes we shall not find a solution of 
our troubles; and I testify to you that to this Church the Lord has 
given the means of accomplishing this thing. I testify to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that the day will come when out of this Church 
shall come the men and the women who will solve these problems — 
for let me say to you that the most valuable asset of this Church is its 
trained body of men and women who are fortified for this day of 
disrespect of law and of order. We have been schooled and drilled 
to have confidence in our leadership, and they have never deceived ,us, 
and now, shall we abandon the old standards, shall we depart from that 
method that has united us together and held us as one people, a mighty 
power because we are one? I trust the leadership of this Church, my 
brethren and sisters. I want to speak for them that you shall pay 
heed unto their words, unto their counsel, unto their advice. 

GOD IS WORKING AMONG THE NATIONS. 

One of the questions discussed at this conference is not a politi- 
cal question. I protest against its being a political question. There 
is no election that this would affect at all in the future. It is a states- 
man's question, and I say that I thank the Lord that we have a prophet 
in our midst who can speak, not only for the Latter-day Saints but 
for the whole world on this great problem. I would be mortified 
if we had no word for the world or for the Latter-day Saints on this 
great momentous question in which God is taking a conspicuous part. 
Brethren and sisters, the Lord is working among the nations of the 
earth, as the 'brethren have expressed it. This work is the hub, but 
out from it go the spokes, and the wheel is moving. God is working 
among the nations. He gave the victory to the Allies. He intended 
from the very beginning to give it to them, but it was only a question — 
when are they worthy of it, when can it be entrusted to them? He 
did deliver us one year earlier than we might have expected the victory, 
looking upon it from all human standpoints. God gave it. He delivered 
us from the loss of perhaps a million of our boys ; and I presume if 
we had been afflicted, if we had been touched like France and England, 
and even as Germany ; if every home was 'mourning the loss of a son, 
then I think we, too, would be stirred in our hearts to give more than 
we have been asked to give in the hope that we might save a future 
trouble of this kind. We have not been touched like they have. God 
in his mercy hath saved us. O I pray that we shall learn their lessons, 
without having to take the same affliction and sorrow and punishment 
they did to yield to the accomplishment of God's purposes in the earth. 
The scripture that I have just read admonishes us that the Lord will 
raise up among all nations men who will teach his word according to 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

the needs of that particular nation. I call attention also to the word 
of the Lord found in the Book of Abraham as follows : 

Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was; and among all these were many of 
the great and noble ones; and God saw these souls that they were good, 
and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my 
rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they 
were good; and he said unto me: Abraham: Thou art one of them; thou 
wast chosen before you wast born. 

So I believe that God loves the world, and he desires their deliv- 
erance. My heart and my soul thrills now, when I think that Germany 
herself has already signed the pact that will prevent her from ever 
imprisoning a "Mormon" missionary again, or banishing them from 
her country ; and if this shall triumph, it will open every nation under 
heaven for the freedom that we long for, so that the elders of this 
Church may carry the gospel message to all the peoples of the world. 
That appeals to me above everything else ; for I love the souls of the 
children of men. But I recognize the battle that is on. From the 
very beginning, it has been a contest between the powers of evil and 
the powers of God. When Jesus stood, in that hour of his tempta- 
tion, when the adversary presented before him, in panoramic vision, 
the kingdoms of this world, in all their splendor, and offered them to 
Jesus on easy terms, namely: Only bow down and worship me, and 
I will give them all to thee. He knew that it was that for which Jesus 
came into the world, namely, to have right of rulership' and governor- 
ship over the kingdoms of the world. Jesus might have answered : 
"Satan, though you rule from the rivers to the end of the earth, you 
have no right nor title that is valid to the kingdoms of this world. 
Yours is only a 'squatter's' right. If I should accept it on these terms,' 
it would be valueless. It was for this purpose that I did come to 
the world, but I can not obtain it on your terms. I must die for it ;" 
and he died to earn the right to rule over the nations of the earth. 
While, temporarily, the adversary who waged this war, to prevent the 
rule of right and of Christ in the earth, has been defeated in that way, 
he now tries another means to defy law and order and to stir up the 
hearts of men to rebellion against the forms of government to destroy 
the very foundations thereof. If he can not rule it, then he will wreck 
it. That is his spirit and the contest is on and my soul rejoices in every 
and all measures that look to the winning of the world for otir Christ. 
I recognize that he hath raised up inspired men in many nations. I do 
feel and always have felt grateful to the Lord for the .testimony that 
I received that he has had his hand over this land. He was with Wash- 
ington. He gave him the vision "of the future, in Valley Forge, that 
stirred the hearts of the drooping soldiers and set on fire the spirit of 
liberty, crossed the Delaware in a most unseasonable time and struck 
terror into the hearts of the enemy. I have found in my study of the 
past that He hath manifested himself, again and again. Who doubts 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the inspiration that was resting upon that great servant of the Lord, — 
Abraham Lincoln, the man of his hour and his time? 

The Lord said to President Wilford Woodruff, as I am told, 
when he, in the closing years of his ministry feared lest there should 
not be found men in the Church to uphold the standards of the Church 
and lead it off triumphantly: "There have already been born in the 
Church those who will lead it off triumphantly, until the Lord Jesus 
shall come." I have that confidence also for our country. I have felt 
in my soul that God has held the balance of power. He_can turn a 
state from small things. He can bring great results to pass, and I 
have always found it possible to bow my will to the will that has ob- 
tained — recognizing that God is in it — and to support and uphold those 
whom the Lord calls for the hour and for the time. 

I recognized, long before the death of Theodore Roosevelt, that 
the Lord raised him up to stir the hearts of men to civic righteousness, 
as perhaps no man could have stirred them ; and I now recognize that. 
God has raised up the man who stands as the President of this Nation, 
even as he has said he would, and God is using him. God will use 
men for the accomplishment of his purposes, whether they know it or 
not. That is my faith. 

AUTHORITY, PLACE AND POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I ask you to remember the sta- 
tion and the position which the Lord has given to the president of this 
Church. I am deeply desirous that the place which the Lord gave to 
the president of this Church shall not be altered nor changed. I will 
read to you two or three verses from the 21st Section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, given on the very day the Church was organized : 

Behold there shall be a record kept 1 among you, and in it thou shalt 
be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an 
elder of the Church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of 
your Lord Jesus Christ. 

Being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and 
to build it up unto the most holy faith. 

.'Which church was organized and established in the year of your 
Lord eighteen hundred and thirty, in the fourth month, and on the sixth 
day of the month, which is called April. 

Wherefore, meaning the Church, thou shalt give heed unto all his 
words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth 
them, walking in all holiness before me; 

For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all 
patience and faith; 

For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against 
you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from 
before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's 
glory. 

That is the right, the power, and the authority that God has 
vested in the leader of his Church, in all the Administrations, until

this moment, and we must not fail to remember that, while we fol- 
lowed the leaders of the past with full reverence and confidence, 
the Lord hath called the man for the hour, even as he has done in the 
past, now to lead this Church, and that above him stands our Father 
and the Redeemer of the world, directing him, and I bear witness to 
you that we have never had a president who has presided over this 
Church who has been more susceptible, more anxious to receive the 
inspiration and the revelation of God for the blessing of this people- 
While he is a man like most men of strong will, we, his closest 
associates, have nevertheless, seen him yield his strong opinions ,to the 
influences of the power of God. So that he has but one thought, to 
get the word and the will of the Lord and give it to the Latter-day 
Saints, and I ask. for him — which is his right under the appointment 
of the Lord — all the respect, all the honor, all the confidence that have 
ever been enjoyed by those who have led this Church heretofore ;because 
God hath not changed, though presidents may come and go. Jesus 
hath not changed. These are his servants. I bear witness of it. Let 
no small difference of opinion become the parting of the ways to any 
of us, my brethren and sisters. Let us be willing to submit ourselves 
to counsel and to advice and leadership that our God has appointed, 
remembering that though there have been strong men who have even 
stood in the presence of the Redeemer of the world, yet they have 
failed and have separated themselves and parted from this Church. But 
in almost every instance, from that day until this, it has been by 
reason of. the fact that they have not been willing to follow the leader- 
ship of the living prophets and leaders of the Church. They have 
wanted to follow, or have felt they were following, the leadership of 
the dead prophets, and they were their own interpreters as to what the 
dead prophets would say on this or that occasion. The Lord used the 
dead prophets in their time, to do their work, but they have gone — 
and all honor and credit to them and their ministry. But here is an- 
other situation : My duty and your duty is to submit now, in confidence 
— and I bespeak for my brethren, your confidence. T know they are 
entitled to it — to the living leadership of this Church, for God is 
with them ; I know it ; and may he be with us, that we may go grandly 
forward to meet the troubles that now confront the labor world and 
that come in various forms, for the Lord hath equipped us and drilled 
us and schooled us, if we shall only follow in the way he has appointed, 
to avert all the troubles, to remain a united people and to go forward 
to the accomplishment of the grand mission and purpose which the 
Lord has given this Church, the greatest of which lies before us. God 
help us to stay with the good shepherds, to go on and perform our 
duty and be among those who shall assist in completing the Lord's 
glorious work in the earth, I humbly pray in trie name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

A trio, "God be Merciful Unto Us," was sung by Arthur Evan, 
James Neilsen, and Minnie Eckhardt.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have been delighted with the blessings of the Lord that have 
been poured out upon us during this conference. 

I had no intention to speak but have decided to make a few re- 
marks to this very wonderful congregation of Latter-day Saints, oc- 
cupying the short time which remains. 

OVERWHELMING RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENCY. 

As I stated, I rejoice in the rich outpourings of the Spirit of the 
Lord. When I first came to the Presidency the thought of the respon- 
sibility that rested upon me was overwhelming and for several weeks 
it was impossible for me' to obtain my needed rest. It became absolutely 
necessary for me to go to the coast to get the needed amount of sleep ; 
because men cannot live very long who do not get rest at night. 

A WONDERFUL MANIFESTATION AND TESTIMONY. 

When I was chosen one of the apostles — -as I stated this morn- 
ing in a little meeting of the Religion Classes — from; October until Feb- 
ruary, I was very unhappy, notwithstanding the fact that my call had 
come by direct revelation ; and the reason was because of my having 
had such a wonderful reverence and respect, almost adoration for the 
men who held the apostleship. If there was one thing that my dear 
departed mother impressed upon my very soul it was reverence and 
respect for the Priesthood of the living God, and for the men who 
stood at the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of" Latter-day Saints. 
When the call came to trie to be an apostle, the spirit of the adversary 
pursued me day 'and night, from October until February, telling me 
that I was- unfit to occupy that exalted office- Every time that I bore 
witness of my knowledge that Jesus was the Christ, the words would 
fly back in my face : "You lie ; you have not seen him." I would wake 
up in the night feeling that I should resign, that I was unworthy. A 

relative of mine said to me one day : "Do you know that Brother 

declared that no man was fit to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who had not seen the Lamb of God?" He had first asked me the 
question, "Have you ever seen the Lamb of God," I said, "No." Then 
he referred to this man's declaration. I said: "Yes, I know that." 
"Well then, how is it that you stand as an apostle?" I answered: 

"Which would you rather believe — the Lord Almighty or Elder ?" 

He said : "The Lord." I said : "So would I ; and he sent a revelation 
calling* me, and I will take his word for it that I am fit to occupy the 
position." But, just the same, I did not confess that, day and night, 
there was a feeling upon me, calling upon me to resign. I took a 
trip, in January, 1883, with Brigham Young, Jr., to San Luis Valley, 
Colorado, to San Juan, to .the Arizona stakes, to Mexico, where we 
visited the Yaqui Indians. In Arizona we visited the Navajos and 
also the Moquis. Speaking of the Navajos, I regret very much that 
I did not have a shorthand reporter with me when we held a meeting 
with Manulita, the war chief of the Navajo Indians. I could not 
understand a word he said, but I knew that he spoke with a fire and 
a force and fervor that I had seldom heard in all my life, and the in- 
terpreter, Brother Ernest Titjen, said that it was the most wonderful 
speech he had ever heard. The Indian chief was speaking about the 
wrongs of the Indians and the diseases that had come among the In- 
dians from the whites ; and he spoke of the failure of the whites, ex-, 
cept only the "Mormons" to treat the Indians rightly. He announced 
that the women of the Indian nation were safe in the hands of the 
"Mormons." There was trouble, at that time, in that section of the 
Navajo Indian Reservation, but he said : "You are absolutely safe to 
travel among the Navajos, because I will send word ahead that you 
are 'Mormons,' and they know- that 'Mormons' are the friends of the 
red men." While in the Navajo Indian Reservation, traveling in a 
company of perhaps half a dozen wagons and eight or ten horsemen, 
we would alternate riding in the wagons and on horseback. I was 
riding at the rear of the company with the late President Lot Smith 
of the Little Colorado stake, and as we were traveling in a southeast- 
erly direction, suddenly the road turned and went northeast. But 
continuing from where the road changed was a well-beaten path, I said : 
"Wait a minute, Lot, where does that trail lead?" He said, "O it 
reaches down there three or four miles and swings back into the road. 
We will make a regular mule-shoe with the road, and then join the 
trail. There is a deep gully that a team cannot cross, therefore we 
have to go around." I said : "Can a horseman cross it ?" He said, 
"Yes." "Well," L said, "Lot, I want to be alone. Go ahead, follow 
the crowd. I will go over here all alone and meet you when the trail 
joins the road." First I asked him, "Is there any danger from the Nav- 
ajos?" He said, "None whatever." I undoubtedly asked this ques- 
tion because only a few days before I had visited the spot where 
George A." Smith, Jr., — I believe the only son of that beloved and saintly 
woman, Bathsheba W. Smith, had been killed by the Navajo Indians, 
and I was naturally a little nervous, going off alone in that section ot 
the country. The reason that I wanted to be alone was that I was

oppressed, as I had never been before, even from October until that 
moment, with that awful feeling of dread and doubt and with the 
suggestion hammering away at my brain that I ought to resign as an 
apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, that I had never done anything 
that entitled me to that distinction, that I had never performed any 
special labor, that I was not posted on the gospel, as an apostle ought 
to be ; that my mind had been given to the ordinary affairs of life, and 
that I should step aside and let some other man be called who, I be- 
lieved, was better qualified for the position than myself. 

With this awful depression upon me, I desired to be alone, and 
I rode across there, tortured, so to speak, by the devil. After riding 
about a mile, I suddenly stopped the mule on which I was riding, and 
I communed with High Heaven. It was revealed to me there, sitting 
alone in the Navajo Indian Reservation, that I had done nothing to 
entitle me to the great honor of being an 'apostle, except that I had kept 
my life pure and sweet. It was revealed to me there that a council was 
held in heaven, exactly the same as we hold councils here. Matters 
were discussed, and there was presented the question of filling the two 
vacancies existing in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles ; that the con- 
ference had adjourned, and those two vacancies remained and ought to 
be filled. The question was : "Whom shall we call, in sending a revela- 
tion to fill those vacancies?" My father, Jedediah M. Grant, who died 
when I was a baby, only nine days old, asked God, our heavenly 
Father, that his son, Heber J. Grant, be called as an apostle, and Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet of this last dispensation, the man who, as a child, 
communed with God, our Father— who had communed with Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer, and was told by the Savior of the world to 
join none of the churches then extant, as they had all gone astray, and 
that he should be the instrument in the hands of God to restore the 
gospel again to the earth — that great Latter-day Prophet joined in the 
request made by my father, and the revelation was sent calling me 
to be an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

JOY IN PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL. 

f 

No man, I believe ever had less happiness or less joy than I had 
in proclaiming the gospel from October, 1882, when I was called to be 
an apostle, until February, 1883, when the Lord Almighty gave to me 
this manifestation. But I believe that no man lives who has ever had 
sweeter joy, who has ever had greater happiness than I have had in 
testifying to the divinity of this work, in Japan, in the Hawaiian 
Islands, from Canada to Mexico, in nearly every State of the Union, 
in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Belgium, Holland, Germany, 
France, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, — testifying 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is his 
prophet. There is no joy, there is no happiness in all the world, that 
can compare with that which comes into the heart of a Latter-day 
Saint when, under the inspiration of the living God, he is able to bear

witness: "I know that God lives, I know that Jesus is the Christ, \ 
know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the true and the living God, 
and that this work called 'Mormonism' is in very deed the plan of 
life and salvation ;" and I bear that witness before you here today, for 
I have the knowledge from God, and I lie not. God bless you all. 
Amen.

Prayer was offered by Elder Hyrum G. Smith, Presiding Patri- 
arch of the Church. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An over-flow meeting of the conference was held at the Assembly 
Hall adjoining the Tabernacle at 10 a. m. presided over by Joseph 
Fielding Smith, of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The sing- 
ing was by the Richards ward Choir, Lon Fisher director, Tracy Y. 
Cannon, organist. 

Choir sang: "Awake and Arise." 

Prayer was offered by Edward W. Croft, president of the Big 
Horn stake of Zion. 

The choir sang: "Christ has risen," solos by Myrtle Doelle and 
J. E. Carr. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

I am pleased, my brethren and sisters, to meet with you. on this 
occasion, and to have the opportunity to address, for a few minutes, 
this overflow meeting; and being called upon to be the first speaker, I 
shall consider it my privilege to choose my subject. While I shall be 
able to reach the ears of only a few of the great multitudes who at- 
tend this conference, there will perhaps be an opportunity of reaching 
many more through that which may be published. 

I have in my mind to refer very briefly to the work which is being 
done in the Historian's Office, particularly the history of the Church 
pertaining to the 19th century. The present, I trust, will be well taken 
care of, and I hope that better historical work will be done from now 
on than has ever been done before. This Church having grown 
from the time of its first organization with six members until it now 
numbers at least half a million has become a most important factor 
in the affairs of the world. In- the beginning, when there were only a 
few members and only a few branches of the Church, the Latter- 
■ day Saints were almost unknown, but as the work spread to nearly all 



. ELDER ANDREW J EN SON.- 



127 



parts of the United States an dlater to Canada, Great Britain, and 
many other countries, most of the civilized world became acquainted 
to a greater or less extent with the assertion made by the missionary 
elders of the Church that the Lord had opened the heavens anew and 
had restored to earth the gospel of Jesus Christ. As the Church grew, 
many events, which seemed small and insignificant in the beginning, 
began to tower high as something of great importance, owing to the 
great results that followed from apparently small and humble be- 
ginnings. This fact has caused the historians of the Church, at the 
present time, to turn their attention to the earlier days, and wander 
back over the old ground covered only in part by the early historians, 
and reconstruct and add new items to the history of the Church, with- 
out, however, changing- that which had formerly been written, only 
adding and enlarging- and giving details which were overlooked at 
the time that the Church was small. With that object in view we have 
been very busy at the Historian's Office during the past thirty-two 
years writing a detailed history of the Church from the beginning, in 
journal form, commencing with the 6th of April, 1830, and contin- 
uing to the present time. In our extensive labors we have contributed 
to this history of the Church from many sources which were untouched 
by the early historians who were satisfied to make up their history 
mainly from the current reports and the data sent in to the head- 
quarters of the Church from adjacent settlements and branches, of 
which there were then only a few, compared with the present time. 

But many years ago our attention was drawn to the fact that 
much of the Church history, at the Historian's Office, was fragmentary 
— that the historical thread was not complete, but in many cases dis- 
connected and unsatisfactory. This was especially the case when we 
looked into the history of any particular stake, mission, branch -or 
settlement of the Saints, for we discovered that there were, in many 
cases, no connecting links between the events that had happened in 
these different localities. In order to make the story complete, so as to 
make a consecutive history, we found it necessary to go into the fields 
ourselves; that is, visit the different stakes and missions for the pur- 
pose of obtaining additional information which should enable us to 
make unbroken or continuous histories of the various organizations in 
the Church. Hence, about thirty-two years ago we commenced ex- 
tensive travels in which we visited all the stakes of Zion in this great 
inter-mountain region in the interest of Church history. Our travels 
extended from our settlements, in Canada on the north to those in 
Mexico in the south, including, of course, all within the confines of the 
United States. On these historical tours we usually called special 
meetings in the different settlements of the Saints, in which we fre- 
quently delivered lectures on Church history and drew attention to the 
importance of record keeping. Not only did we encourage the stake 
and ward clerks and the secretaries of quorums and auxiliary associa- 
tions to keep records, but we also advised the keeping of family and 
personal records by the individual members of the Church. After a 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



general meeting, usually held in the evening, to which the public was 
invited, we made appointments for the following day to meet with all 
the record keepers in the ward, and as many of the old settlers as we 
could possibly get together, always having everybody bring such rec- 
ords with them to the meeting as they might possess. We then di- 
vided into groups, directing the different secretaries to cull from their 
records such items as we might need for history. Thus we obtained 
not only a general history of the ward, but a history of the quorums of 
the Priesthood, the Relief Society, the Sunday School, the Mutual 
Improvement Associations, Primary Associations, Religion Classes, 
etc. We also had the old settlers relate to us their experiences, in 
the states of Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, and other places, and then have 
them tell us of incidents that happened to them in crossing the ocean 
with sailing vessels, and on the plains with ox teams and handcarts, 
ending up with what they had experienced after their arrival in Utah, 
or after becoming settlers in any of the western towns, founded by 
Latter-day Saints. The notes made in these meetings were brought 
to the Historian's Office and there deposited carefully in boxes, ordered 
for the purpose, awaiting the transcribing and editing into the history 
of the" Church. These visits we continued for at least five or six years 
in the different stakes of Zion, until all the settlements of the Saints 
in the great west had been visited, some of them several times. 

After that we were sent abroad to all the Latter-day Saints mission- 
ary fields throughout the world, and in the travels in foreign lands 
thus planned and carried out we visited nearly all the conferences and 
branches of the Church in all the world, and did to a certain extent 
the same kind of labor which we had accomplished, in the several 
Stakes of Zion, with the exception that in the missionary fields we 
consulted old members of the Church instead of old settlers. On our 
arrival in Great Britain we found that a great many of the old records 
originally kept in the various conferences and branches of the Church 
had been lost, but those that could be found we gathered together with 
great care and sent them home to the Historian's Office, where hun- 
dreds of these records (many of them of very great value) arc now 
safely housed. In Scandinavia we found nearly all the old records 
preserved, and they were gathered and shipped to Church headquarters 
the same as the records from Great Britain. The records from the Swiss 
and German mission and from the missions on the islands of the sea, 
were also gathered in and sent home. 

This much being accomplished we next commenced a most ex- 
tensive labor at the Historian's Office by compiling Church history 
from the records gathered, and from the extensive notes which we 
had made on our travels. We were successful in obtaining the ser- 
vices of expert typists who could write on their machines nearly as 
fast as we could formulate sentences in our minds for dictation, and 
thus we dictated from the notes collected histories of the different 
stakes of Zion with all their wards and settlements, and also histories 
' of the various missions abroad, with their conferences and branches.

This work went on, as a side issue, for several years,' the general, or 
journal history of the Church, being kept up at the same time. We 
continued this dictating work until a recent date or until nearly 'all 
the notes gathered on our travels had been converted into readable 
matter, and then we found that, in order to be absolutely accurate and 
correct in our statements, it would be necessary to make a final visit 
to all the wards and settlements of the Saints, for the purpose of 
reading to the old settlers and others the histories which we had pre- 
pared. I would like all the Saints to understand that this work is one 
of a considerable magnitude. It represents, so far as I know, historical 
work of a nature which never before has been attempted in writing 
histories of any community in this or any other country. I do not 
believe that a better effort has ever been put forth anywhere to get 
accurate and truthful history. On some of my travels I have carefully 
examined the histories of other states and countries, and especially on 
two of my trips to the states I examined many county histories in Ohio, 
Missouri, Illin'ois, Iowa and Nebraska, for the purpose of learning 
how such histories were generally prepared. I soon discovered that 
most of the historians who had prepared and' written such histories, 
to a greater or less extent, had been the servants of individuals who 
would pay them for their labors, and thus they were under the neces- 
sity or obligation of coloring facts and events in favor of their patrons, 
and people who happened to be poor, but perhaps had done very much 
more than some others, were left out of consideration and were given 
no credit because they could not pay. That which drew my special 
attention was some of the narratives in which the Latter-day Saints 
were associated historically. In almost every instance I found that 
the Latter-day Saints had been wickedly and maliciously misrepre- 
sented, and that, in many cases, riots and acts of mobs were palliated, 
condoned and interpreted as being justifiable in cases where the Latter- 
day Saints were the victims of terrible outrages. I am sure that the ' 
history that we, as Church historians, are preparing, from a truthful 
standpoint will in many, many instances conflict with that which has 
been written by our enetnies. 

In preparing and writing history, your historians, backed as they 
have been by the Church, have been under no particular obligation to 
anyone as to what we should write and to whom we should give credit. 
We have been in a position to do justice to everybody, to the rich and 
the poor and to the living and to the dead alike, endeavoring to tell 
the truth in every instance. 

I take great pleasure, on this occasion, to inform the Latter-day 
Saints that such a work as that to which I have alluded has been done, 
and I give it as my opinion that the time is not far distant when the 
achievements of the Latter-day Saints as preachers of practical Chris- 
tianity and as founders of real Christian settlements in the United 
"States will be appreciated and acknowledged by mankind generally. 
We have not only figured prominently as pioneers in Utah, but our 
people were also the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in what are now the 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



States of Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona. 
The "Mormons" also turned the little Spanish village of Yerba Buena, 
in California, into the present San Francisco, and founded other set- 
tlements of importance on, or near, the Pacific coast, including the 
famous town of San Bernardino and a pioneer settlement in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Some very pretty things could also be told about the 
Mormon Battalion and the "Mormon" pioneers generally who became 
empire 'founders in western America. Your historians have tried to 
the best of their ability to get at the facts in all cases and to write 
up the events so truthfully that our children will know what has been 
done by their fathers and mothers, who were pioneers in Utah and 
the other states which have been mentioned. Sooner or later the peo- 
ple of the United States and all the world will know that the Latter-day 
Saints, persecuted and misrepresented as they have been, were the 
pioneers of true Christian civilization in the various localities in this 
western country where they settled', and that they, as a God-fearing 
people, turned the wilderness and deserts into fruitful fields. 

At the present time we are engaged in making a final tour to the 
existing seventy-nine stakes of Zion, and we shall continue this labor 
until we have made a final visit to all the stakes and wards, and cities 
and towns, where Latter-day Saints reside. We realize that this labor 
cannot be delayed, as the early settlers are fast passing away, 
and if the history, as we have prepared it, is not read now it would 
be useless to attempt to read it for correction later, as there would 
perhaps be none of the old pioneers left to listen to it, or to help us 
in making corrections. About half the stakes have been visited already, 
and we shall not be satisfied until all have been similarly visited, and the 
histories prepared of the different stakes and wards have been pre- 
sented to the people and accepted by them. On this, our final visit, 
in the interest of Nineteenth Century Church history, we are also 
gathering new material, although our main aim at present is to com- 
plete the history of the Church, and of its various units, from the 
beginning to the close of the last century. 

We desire to make a 'final and earnest appeal to all parties in- 
terested in this history of the Church to render us aid in completing our 
labors. We desire to borrow from the old pioneers or their children 
such private record's as may have been kept by them, and we would 
plead with the present generation that they keep records and preserve 
them, as- the time will come when the doings of our own day will be as 
important and interesting to those who live after us as the experi- 
ences and narratives of the early pioneers of Utah now are to us. 

We have been intrusted with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and we have been intrusted also with the privilege of preaching that 
gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. It is the true 
and original gospel of Jesus Christ, and we have a right to hand 
down to future generations a true history of how that gospel message 
was intrusted to the Latter-day Saints and how we have filled our 
mission. We desire that our children and' children's children should

know what it means to them to be descendants of the God-fearing 
pioneers of Utah and the great west. I feel certain that the time 
will come, if it has not already arrived, that the children of the Latter- 
day Saints will be as proud to trace their origin back to the Mormon, 
pioneers as early members of the Church, as many now are in tracing 
their descent from the Pilgrim Fathers or the early settlers of Virginia 
in the beginning of the Seventeenth Century. The Latter-day Saints 
have made a history which, in most of its details, will be entirely unlike 
the histories made by any other people who have settled in this west- 
ern land. They have always been a God-fearing people, and a people 
who fear God and keep his commandments and conform their daily 
habits to the gospel of Jesus Christ will, in all cases, make different 
history from those who, either through carelessness or wickedness, 
disobey the mandates of heaven during their sojourn on this mun- 
dane sphere. 

May we, as the children of the early Latter-day Saints and the 
pioneers of Utah and the great west, be worthy descendants of our 
noble predecessors, may we continue the work which they so faithfully 
commenced and endeavor by our acts to make as commendable a history 
as they did. May we, as representatives of the true Church of Jesus 
Christ, be the means of bringing the knowledge of that gospel to all 
people for the benefit of our own as well as future generations, and 
may we, finally, together with our forefathers and our descendants, be 
saved in the celestial kingdom of our God, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang: "Glory to God in the Highest." 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church.) 

I am deeply impressed with the responsibility of addressing this 
large congregation this morning, and I hope that I shall be able to 
make myself heard. I have frequently sat in congregations where the 
voice of the speaker has not reached me, and I know how trying and 
tedious it is not to hear the person who is speaking. 

I see before me Latter-day Saints who have felt in their hearts , 
the power and influence of the gospel and who, in their daily lives, 
are- striving with all their human weaknesses to serve the Lord and 
to keep his commandments. We ane here to be fed with the bread of 
life — ihe gospel of Jesus Christ. Many of you have come long distances 
and some of you may be disappointed at your inability to get into the 
great Tabernacle to partake of the spirit of that meeting. The Lord 
has said that where two or throe are gathered together in his name, 
there he will be with them, and that to bless. I have long since learned 
that numbers do not make a meeting, although there is an inspiration 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in numbers. I have been in meeting where a few latter-day Saints 
have met and have felt the power of the Lord just as much as in 
any large meeting. So I feel this morning in looking at your up- 
turned faces that I am speaking to my brethren and sisters who have 
felt the power of God. 

We come to these great semi-annual conferences in order that 
we may be edified; that the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ may be 
taught to us, that it may appeal to our feelings and emotions. We 
also come that we may be taught doctrine and principle, and, if neces- 
sary, to be reproved for our weaknesses, our failings and our imper- 
fections. When we come to a meeting like this, willing to be taught 
the principles of the gospel, and reproved, if necessary, then we will 
have the Spirit of the Lord in our midst. 

I have been at meetings where men and women have borne their 
testimonies who could scarcely express themselves, yet I have been 
thrilled in my very being with their testimonies. 

I desire, during the few minutes I may address you, to call atten- 
tion to the subject that has been very prominently before the Latter- 
day Saints during the last two or three years, and that is, the spirit of 
worship upon the Sabbath day. I feel sincerely that in many of our 
Sabbath gatherings and sacramental meetings we lack the spirit of 
worship. Some of us go to meeting because it is a habit (and it is 
an excellent habit too). I would not decry nor speak against any 
habit that is a good one. Do we "enter the sacrament meeting as if 
it were a commonplace affair? Do we go to be entertained? I some- 
times feel that we are drifting into the idea that we must be enter- 
tained at our sacrament meetings to induce us to attend. I have heard 
it expressed more than once : "I don't think I will go to meeting to- 
night; it will be just an ordinary meeting." In consequence of this 
feeling being developed among the Latter-day Saints, our bishops are 
going outside of their wards inviting brethren to go and address their 
congregations in order to increase the attendance at their sacrament 
meetings. The Lord has told his people, "And that thou mayest more 
fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the 
house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day." 

There is something more important in this sacrament meeting 
than going to listen to speaking. The Lord has commanded us that as 
often as we shall meet together and partake of the sacrament in re- 
membrance of his sufferings that we shall worship him in spirit and in 
truth. We should enter our meetinghouses with a spirit of reverence 
to God and to his servants, reverence for the house of worship and 
for the sacrifice made by our Lord and Savior, for he has promised'" us 
that if we will partake of the sacrament worthily and renew our cove- 
nants before him, he will grant unto us his holy Spirit. We should, 
therefore, enter the house of worship with the Spirit of the Lord in 
our hearts. Peace and order should prevail in that building and 
throughout the whole of the service. 

A short time ago I was in a stake of Zion, and after the confer- 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH. 



133 



ence gatherings I was asked to attend a ward meeting on the Sunday 
evening. While the sacrament was being administered two boys en- 
tered the building and ran up the aisle. They were immediately stopped 
by older persons. This building was used for a playground, basket 
ball, dances and every other kind of local entertainment. These boys 
entered the house in the manner they did, because they could not sep- 
arate it from a house of worship, it having been used for a basket ball 
game on the previous evening. 

We should set the example and teach our young people that when 
we enter the house of the Lord, we should do so with the spirit of 
devotion in our hearts, and partake of the sacrament of the Lord's 
supper, remembering his death and sufferings. Whatever we do should 
be done in the spirit of devotion and worship. We should not partake 
,of the sacrament mechanically, we should repeat mentally the sacra- 
mental prayer. Our eyes should be closed and our thoughts concen- 
trated on the sacred duty we are performing when we partake of the 
sacrament of the Lord's supper. 

I appeal to you, my brethren and sisters, to go home determined 
that hereafter when you enter a house of worship you shall do so 
quietly and orderly, and that gossiping shall be discontinued, that 
peace and order shall prevail as far as our influence will permit ; for if 
we will enter the house of worship in this manner, the Spirit of 
the Lord will be with us, our worship will be acceptable unto him, our 
faith will increase, and, whether those who may address us speak 
fluently or not, we shall feel the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, 
if we already have it in our hearts, and doctrine and knowledge will 
be imparted unto us. It cannot be otherwise where a congregation is 
seeking, under the influence of the Lord, to be edified and instructed 
in the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may be with his people, that 
Zion may grow and prosper, that the Sabbath day may be observed as 
the Lord has commanded, and that the spirit of worship and devotion 
to our Father in heaven may be in our hearts, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church.) 

My brethren and sisters. I do not like to speak before a congrega- 
tion when so many are standing. I feel more at home when we are 
all comfortable, for it is seldom I am uncomfortable when occupying 
this position. 

I believe that if there is ever a time when one needs the guidance 
of the Spirit of the Lord more than any other time, it is when trying 
to address a congregation of Latter-day Saints. I do sincerely pray 
that I may have the guidance of that Spirit, for I know you have 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



come with a hope that you will receive the word of the Lord, and I 
have in my heart only a desire to say to you that which will have his 
approval and be for our uplifting and good. 

I was wondering, when Brother Jenson was speaking, how many 
of us fully realize the importance of the work he and his associates are 
doing. And when I think of the difficulty with which they have gath- 
ered information to enable them to write a history, compared with the 
methods of today, I sometimes marvel at the success they are obtain- 
ing. Conditions have changed now, and our records are being kept 
in such a way that it will not be necessary for Brother Jenson, in the 
future, to go from stake to stake and from ward to ward to gather 
details necessary to an accurate history of this Church. I wonder 
how many of us, as Latter-day Saints, realize the importance of this 
work, and the importance of keeping this record for ourselves, for 
our families. It is important that this be done. 

One thought came to my mind while Bishop Wells was speaking, 
and I am sure he will not be offended if I interpret what he said from 
my point of view, for we have worked together now eleven years and 
have had no difficulty or misunderstanding during that time. Bishop 
Wells said that he was sorry that it was necessary to hold basket 
ball games and dances in our meeting houses, and I agree with him fully 
on that point, but while he regretted that it is necessary to use our 
meetinghouses for such purposes, I believe he did not intend to leave 
the impression that we should not have these amusements. He in- 
tended to impress upon us the importance of having these amusements 
when occasion requires, directed by the proper influence ; so that, after 
a dance or after a basket ball game, the young people would enter the 
house having in their hearts a'desire to serve God and a reverence for 
the building. We may have our dances in our meetinghouses when 
occasion requires, and I believe dances are good when conducted prop- 
erly, but bad when left without supervision. I think that is what he 
said, in different words. Basket ball games are necessary, and I would 
dislike to deprive the boys of the privilege of playing when the meet- 
inghouse is the only place where they can go to" play. I would say, let 
them go there, but let us have that place so guarded that during the 
whole play those boys have in their hearts a spirit of reverence and of 
brotherly love, and not a spirit of contention, which breeds hatred in 
their hearts. Now, I think we agree to that extent, and I would like 
to see in all the wards and stakes of Zion, as Brother Wells said, a spirit 
of reverence and worship, a spirit of brotherly love, in our dances, and 
in our games, and have it continue with us and go with us on the Sab- 
bath day and other days when we enter the Church for the purpose 
of worship or otherwise. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, there is one subject tnat has weighed 
more heavily upon me, I believe, than anything else. I touched upon it 
briefly in our priesthood meeting, last night ; and since that time I have 
tried to think of some topic I might speak upon, if I should be called 
upon to address another gathering at this conference. And each time 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH. 135 

I have tried to concentrate on some other subject, my mind has reverted 
to that one thought, the priesthood, and I am satisfied in my heart that 
many of us do not realize the responsibility that rests upon us as par- 
ents and as men holding the holy Priesthood. Do we read the scrip- 
ture ? Do we read it in our homes ? Do we read it to our children ? I 
think the answer is, many of us do not. As ward authorities do we 
provide work for the young men in our wards? Do we as mothers 
and fathers see to it that our boys and our girls are reared properly, 
and that we are rendering every assistance possible in helping the ward 
authorities to so train our children that they will grow up to be of ben- 
efit to the Church ? I am satisfied, through the observation I have been 
able to make, that the cause of men and women becoming indifferent 
to this work, in their later years, is due to the fact that their training 
in their childhood has not been sufficient to give them a strong foun- 
dation upon which the remainder of their lives might be built. 

I was thinking this morning of the difference in the condition of 
today and of a few years ago. I remember the time when it was my 
duty, with others, to clean and oil the lamps on Saturdays, and put 
them in place ready for the Sabbath meeting. I remember getting up 
on Sunday morning, going to the meeting house, helping build the fires, 
then returning home and changing clothes, and getting ready to go to 
Sunday school. I believe I enjoyed the Sunday school far more than 
the boys do today, who go to a building which has been cleaned and 
heated by a janitor who is paid for the service. As one of the speakers 
said yesterday, wouldn't it be a good thing for us in this day if the 
boys could have something- to do, some responsibility, something to 
make them feel that there is a place for them in the Church, and a work 
for them to do — a condition we are growing from? 

And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doc- 
trine of repentance, faith in Christ, the Son of the living God, and of bap- 
tism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands when 
eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents; for this shall be a 
law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organ- 
ized; and their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins 
when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands, and they shall 
also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord. 
And the inhabitants of Zion shall, also, observe the Sabbath day to keep 
it holy. And the inhabitants of Zion shall, also, remember their labors, 
inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler 
shall be had in remembrance before the Lord. Now, I the Lord, am not 
well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; 
and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not 
earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. (Doc. 
and Cov. 68:25-31.) 

i 

Let us look into our own lives, my brethren and sisters, and see if 
these conditions exist to a certain extent right in our midst, and perhaps 
in our own homes ! If they do, what are we doing to overcome them? 
What are we doing to build up this Church ? What are we doing to 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



enjoy in our homes and in our meeting houses that spirit of reverence 
and of worship spoken of by rBishop Wells? Many of us remain at 
home on the Sabbath day.to do things we choose to do rather than doing 
the things we know in our hearts the Lord desires us to do. The most 
important work we can engage in as Latter-day Saints, is the proper 
training of our children, by precept and example- Let us see to it that 
they have work to do, and that they are doing that work. 

I think that in many of our wards we are permitting the boy 
scouts to usurp, or assume to do, the duty that should be done by the 
deacons in the Church . I deplore this fact. Not that I have anything 
to say against the splendid work of the boy scouts. It is a noble work, 
and it will make of them better boys, if they follow its teachings. At 
the same time, I do not care to see them, as scouts, doing the work re- 
quired of those holding the Priesthood, because the Priesthood is God- 
given. It is God's power conferred upon them through the Holy Ghost 
by those having authority from God, and it comes to them as their 
commission, and nothing else can take its place, or ishould assume to 
do it's work. And O, I do pray, my brethren and sisters, that we will, 
with all our might, work to the end that our boys will have work to do 
in the Priesthood. 

I remember when I was ordained a teacher, a little fellow fifteen 
years of age, I was assigned to labor with an elderly brother, a man 
of experience, a man of judgment and training, who took me with him 
and taught me things I should know. I accompanied him into the 
homes of the Saints. I had very little to do except to learn, and O, that 
experience has been one of the grandest experiences of my life; and I 
thank God, and I hope I will continue to thank him as long as I live, 
for the opportunity that I had of laboring with that good man. He was 
not afraid or ashamed to take a little boy with him into the homes of 
the Saints where he was going to perform his duty as a teacher. 

Just a short time ago my attention was called to a case where a 
young man had just been ordained a teacher, and was assigned to go 
with another man of mature years to visit homes of the Saints. This 
man refused to have the boy accompany him. He said, "I am not 
going teaching with kids. If you can't give me someone who is worthy, 
as a companion, I will not go out teaching." I thought, O, my brother, 
if only you could have had the experience as a boy that I had, you 
wouldn't have spoken that way ; think of the opportunity you have lost. 
■ Where in all the world can we find any one more suited to be a com- 
panion than a young man who is "clean, energetic, willing to serve 
God, and to learn, though he be young in years? 

Let us not neglect the youth of Zion. Let us not neglect the boy 
who has been ordained to the office of a deacon. Let us find work for 
him to do. The duties of the elder, the priest, the teacher and the dea- 
con, I want to impress them upon you. , The duty, not the privilege — 
this may be done or it may not be done. You can do it. if you please ; 
you may fail or neglect it if you don't want to do it- Not that, but the 
duty. O, how many of us have .forgotten that word, the duty under 



ELDER GEORGE W. MCCUNE. 



137 



the Priesthood. I am not going to take time to read what these duties 
are. We all know (at least those who have received the Priesthood 
know) what our duties are; and if we don't know, then we have been 
ordained unworthily; for no man should be ordained to the Priest- 
hood until he knows what the duties of the Priesthood are. No man 
is worthy of the Priesthood unless he knows what its duties are, and 
unless he is willing to work with all his might under that responsibility. 
Many of us elders, seventies, priests, are failing to do our duty, because 
we are neglecting those who are teachers and deacons in this Church. 

I stood upon the street the day President Wilson was here, and 
saw troops of boy scouts come up the street. As they passed their 
scout masters, in every case their hands came to salute, and what re- 
spect ! These boys in uniform, the scouts : why do they do this ? Who 
has taught them to look upon their scout master with such deserved 
respect? And I thought, what a glorious thing it would be for the 
boy, a deacon, if he could be taught to offer the president of his dea- 
cons' quorums and his counselors such respect. What a glorious thing 
it would be if, when passing along the street, our deacons, teachers and 
priests would tip their hats as they pass their bishop or his counselors. 
How many of them have proper respect for their bishop ? How many 
of them look upon their bishop as being a man who should have their 
respect? *I am afraid too few of us have in our hearts this feeling and 
this spirit ; but I do hope and pray that the day will soon come when 
every young man in this Church, who has been called to the lesser 
Priesthood, and honored with that sacred and holy calling, will honor 
that Priesthood, and will honor the men who bear that Priesthood, and 
who are called to positions of authority in the wards and stakes. 

I would like to see the day come, as Brother Wells said, when boys 
will have in their hearts at all times, a feeling of reverence for the meet- 
ing house and grounds. I would like to see boys taught that it is their 
duty, when upon the street, or whenever they pass their bishop, out of 
respect for the Priesthood he bears, to raise their hats to him- Wouldn't 
it make better boys of them, and wouldn't it make a better "man of 
their bishop? I believe it would. 

O, let us feel the responsibility of the Priesthood that rests upon 
us, my brethren. Let us feel the responsibility that rests upon us of 
building .upon the foundation that has been laid ; for if we fail in 
training the youth of Zion, that failure will be charged against us, 
which I pray God, will not be, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: " We thank thee, O God, for 
a Prophet." 

ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of the Eastern States Mission.) 

My dear brethren and sisters. I have enjoyed very much being 
with you this morning, and while I realize it is indeed an honor to be 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



called to stand before a congregation of the Latter-day Saints to 
address them, I must confess I cannot fully appreciate that honor. I 
assure my brethren and sisters who have stood throughout this meet- 
ing, they are just as comfortable at the present time as I am. I desire 
that you will help me by your faith and prayers while I stand before 
you. 

I indorse without reservation all that my brethren have said. T 1, 
have given us so many good thoughts that we cannot go from here feel- 
ing that we have not been fed with the bread of life. I have learned 
to realize, my brethren and sisters, that when we come together to 
worship the Lord, the responsibility is not all upon those who preside 
at the meeting, nor is all the responsibility upon those who address us. 
There is a responsibility upon each and every one of us. For if we 
come together with a real desire in our hearts to worship the Lord, our 
God, he will do his part and he will feed us with the bread of life 
though it may be through a stammering tongue. 

I desire to emphasize one thought that Brother Wells spoke of. 
He suggested that we put spirit into our worship. Oh, what an impor- 
tant thing this is, my brethren and sisters. I suggest that we put spirit 
into our lives, into our very existence, that we do not go through life 
in a listless way, but that we have spirit in all that we do. This is the 
thing the world is crying for. You go to the manufacturer, the busi- 
ness man ; leaders everywhere are calling for spirit. They do not call 
it spirit; of course, not; they call it in the modern slang "pep." They 
have called it enthusiasm, and ginger, and push, and now they call it 
"pep." It is spirit, my brethren and sisters, and it is one of the most 
important things in life. Someone has said that eighty per cent of suc- 
cess is enthusiasm, and I believe it. And I believe that eighty per 
cent of our success is spirit, the spirit with which we do things, the 
spirit with which we endeavor to do the things that Brother Smith has 
been advising us to do as parents, for parenthood is indeed a responsi- 
bility, and if we strive to teach our sons and daughters the principles 
of the gospel of Christ, with spirit, I believe the Lord will bless us and 
we will be successful in a great measure. 

If when we come together, we will put spirit into all features of 
our worship, as we did into the song we have just sung, what a won- 
derful thing it would be ! If I had received nothing else than that one 
hymn we have just sung, with spirit, I would have been fed 'with the 
bread of life. Brethren and sisters, take part In all the features of our 
worship. When we come together, let us strive to cast out from our 
hearts everything that is contrary to sincere worship of God. Let us 
seek earnestly to be truly humble, have a desire to have our souls fed. 
If we do this, I know that the Lord will bless us. When we are in this 
attitude, there is no room in our hearts for hatred or for jealousy or 
anything of that kind; there is true love in our hearts. And when we 
get true love in our hearts we are being fed with the bread of life. 

There is so much of the spirit of criticism, destructive criticism, 
in the world today, that, as Latter-day Saints we' cannot afford' to give 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE.

way to this spirit, not for one minute. When we get this spirit in our 
hearts — that spirit of hatred and malice, we are crowding out that 
beautiful spirit of which I have spoken, that spirit of brotherly love, 
which is the Spirit of God. So, brethren and sisters, when we come 
together let us put spirit into our worship in every feature of it ; when 
an elder is called upon to pray, let us follow him very closely in every 
word he repeats, for remember, he is but the mouthpiece for each and 
every one of us, and if we do not take part in the' prayer, we are not 
doing our duty, and we are not entitled to the blessing of that prayer. 

It is a wonderful thing to know how to pray. I do not mean to 
say I can tell you how it is done but I have lived, lo these forty years 
and upwards, and am just beginning to learn how to pray. And oh, 
my brethren and sisters 1 , I exhort you and myself to learn how to pray. 
As I said, I am just beginning to learn the beauty of prayer, and it is a 
wonderful blessing to be alone and strive with all your heart to pray. 
"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire," and it is a wonderful thing to 
express that desire to our Father in heaven and feel to a slight degree 
that we are approaching our Father in heaven in such a way that he 
desires to come near unto us. It is a wonderful thing ; and we should 
not think of praying without spirit — in a listless way, but think of it 
with spirit, and put our hearts and souls into it, and it will bring bless- 
ings to us. 

And when anyone is addressing us, let us put spirit into the 
thought with which we follow him, and we will be blessed in doing it. 
We will not go to sleep, not at all ; we will be interested in what they 
say. 

And then, when we have the privilege of joining with our breth- 
ren and sisters in congregational singing, put spirit into it. It is a 
wonderful thing to put spirit into our music; it means so much. A 
hymn sung without spirit does not mean anything at all. Like every- 
thing else, it means nothing unless this spirit is in it, and then it is 
wonderful. It would thrill" our very souls if all this congregation would 
put spirit to the fullest extent into our hymns ; these very walls would 
vibrate. 

And so, in all our worship and in all we do, my brethren and sis- 
ters, put spirit into it. As I said in the beginning, that is what the 
world desires, that is what they are starving for. There is so much 
indifference in the world and listlessness ; and we cannot develop like 
unto our Father in heaven, while in listlessness. We are created in 
the image of our Father in heaven ; therefore, we have a wonderful 
thing to do. The Savior said, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father in 
heaven is perfect." We are destined to become like unto our heav J 
enly Father; and we cannot do this mighty work in indifference and 
indolence, we must put spirit into it, into every part of our life's work. 

These words of exhortation, my brethren and sisters, I wish to 
apply to myself, even more than to any one of you. You will pardon 
me if I seem to speak hurriedly; this congregation is so much better 
than I am accustomed to speaking to on the street corners in the big 



140

cities of the East where we talk loud and fast with a desire to stop the 
passers by. It is the most successful way for me to reach them. If I 
talk fast for a few minutes, and earnestly, I get a few hearers, and 
when I get a few, others will come to listen. Then I can slow up and 
be a little more deliberate. I suppose I will never learn to be delib- 
erate when I stand before the Latter-day Saints, for I do get very 
much excited. 

Now, I desire to say to my brethren and sisters, that your sons 
and daughters who have been sent into the Eastern States Mission, 
with very few exceptions, are doing a very splendid work. I love 
them every one ; and I would like to meet their fathers and mothers and 
their wives and sons and daughters ; as many as are here today, I 
desire to assure you of their well being, and they send to you a mes- 
sage of love and good cheer. Their only anxiety is for their loved 
ones at home, and if you will send them a cheerful message, I am sure 
they will continue to develop and progress satisfactorily in the min- 
istry. 

You know, my brethren and sisters, we have but few experienced 
missionaries in the field today. A great majority of our workers are 
new and young and inexperienced in ,the ministry. I think we should 
speak of our weaknesses as well as our strength ; therefore I am going 
to mention one of our weaknesses — and I do it in sweet humility, for 
I may be as guilty of it as any of you; but I desire to point it out, 
with the earnest desire in my heart that it may lead to an improve- 
ment along this line. It is a reproach to us as a people to find so 
many of these splendid young men and women coming out into the 
world as messengers for the Lord Jesus Christ without a knowledge 
of the gospel. That is a sad reproach upon us. I do not mean to 
say that I can tell you how it can be remedied, except by carrying out 
the instructions Brother Smith has read to us ; but I believe if we will do 
this, we will be blessed to a certain degree in getting our young peo- 
ple to learn something about the gospel of Christ. It is indeed a sad 
spectacle to see a splendid young man or young woman come out into 
the mission field and after they have been given instructions as to 
what they are expected to do, to have them come to their conference 
president or the president of the mission, and, with tears in their eyes, 
confess that they know very little about the gospel of Christ, and yet 
they have been sent out as teachers. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let us see if. we cannot improve 
this condition. It is a fact that many in the world know a great deal 
more about the gospel than do these teachers whom we have sent out. 
We know that the Lord makes no requirements at the hands of any 
servant except he provides a way for the accomplishment of that thing, 
and it is very gratifying to see how the Lord does bless and mag- 
nify these young men and women when they apply themselves to learn- 
ing the gospel and teaching it, and I am glad to report they are de- 
veloping wonderfully well. Even some of these young men and women 
who come out and confess that they know nothing about the gospel, 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 141 



after they have been there two or three months studying the gospel — 
without a feeling of boasting at all, I would not be afraid to have 
them meet any of the ministers of religion. Our cause is not suffer- 
ing; the Lord does bless them; they are in the school of the Lord, 
not in 'the school of man, and they are being taught by the Lord 7 in 
the school of the prophets, as it were, and the Lord is with them and 
does bless them ; the work is progressing as satisfactorily as we could 
expect. 

I am glad to note a wonderful improvement in the sentiment 
prevailing among mankind compared with twenty years ago when I 
was upon my former mission. It seems the little leaven is gradually 
leavening the lump. 

The brethren have spoken of amusements in our Church. We 
believe, of course, in all rightful, legitimate, and helpful amusements. 
They are necessary for our well-being and good. It was only a few 
years ago when certain religious denominations looked upon the 
thought of dancing and such other things with horror. I 'say the little 
leaven is beginning to leaven the lump: the staid old Methodists in a 
national or international assembly of their representatives have decided 
to introduce dancing among their young people as a means of draw- 
ing them into and holding them in the church. I do not mention this 
to encourage dancing in our midst, in fact I think some .of it needs 
curtailing, but it is all right when conducted under the proper influ- 
ence and spirit. 

My heart is full of good cheer and good wishes for the Latter- 
day Saints, and I«know that the Spirit of the Lord is in our over- 
flow meeting today. We can all find consolation in the fact that when 
the vessel is filled with milk, the cream comes to the top, and so it is 
the cream that overflows ; and we are in the overflow meeting. The 
Spirit of the Lord is here, and the brethren who have preceded me 
have spoken under the inspiration of the Lord, and if we each do our 
duty, we will be just as well fed with the bread of life as if we were 
in the Tabernacle with the rest of our brethren and sisters. 

Let us seek for the Soirit of the Lord, that the spirit of malice 
and criticism may not gfet hold of us, that it may not crowd out the 
good things from our lives that we are entitled to. 

May the Lord bless you, that his peace and blessings may continue 
to be with and upon these good men who lead us, that we may uphold 
and sustain them bv our faith and pravers and good works. In doing 
this, we are honoring our Father in heaven and helping each other. 
May the Lord help us to this end, I earnestly "ask, in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I know we have all been very much interested in the remarks of 
the brethren who have spoken.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



AN IMPORTANT COMMANDMENT ON PRAYER. 

I desire to begin the remarks that I shall make, where Bishop 
Smith left off, in his reading of Sec. 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

And a commandment I give unto them (that is, unto the parents in 
Zion), that he that observeth not his prayers before the Lord in the season 
thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the judge of my people. 

i 

I do not suppose that we have read that verse in this section any 
too much, and I wonder sometimes if we realize how important this 
command really is. No man can retain the Spirit of the Lord, unless he 
prays. No man can have the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, unless in 
his heart is found this spirit of prayer. We are commanded in the 
scriptures to seek the Lord, to praise his holy name, to labor diligently, 
that his spirit may abide with us. The disciples came to the Master, 
and said unto him, "Lord, teach us to pray." And he did so, and there 
are some good people in the world, who, because the Lord gave that 
prayer, feel that on all occasions and at all times when they pray, they 
should use that prayer and nothing else. But that prayer was given only 
to teach, and not with the idea that no other words should be used, no 
other thoughts should be expressed, but to impress upon the disciples 
that they should make their prayers concise and to the point, and ask 
for those things which they most desired in righteousness, at all times 
thanking the Lord for his mercies and goodness unto them. 

Now I want to dwell upon this passage for a moment or two. 
It states here that "he that observes not his prayers before the Lord 
in the season thereof" is to be had in remembrance. What is the 
season of prayer? 

ALL SEASONS ARE FOR PRAYER. 

Some of us may have the idea that the season of prayer is when 
we arise in the morning, and when we are about to retire at night when 
our work is done, and that there is no other season for prayer. But 
I say unto you, and I have good backing for it, that the season for 
prayer is always. Let me read it to you. You know I like to prove 
what I say ; I like to bring witnesses to bear on that which I express, 
and I do not ask the people to accept that which I say unless it is. 
in harmony, absolutely, with what the Lord has said either directly or 
through his prophets. We read in the Book of Mormon the word of 
Alma to the poor Zoramites who had departed from the truth, and 
having been cast out of their synagogues, because they were poor, and 
feeling that they could only pray one at a time as they ascended in 
the rameumptom, as it is called, they knew not what to do. Alma 
taught them as follows : 

Yea, cry unto him for mercy, for he is mighty to save; yea, humble 
yourselves and continue in prayer unto him; cry unto him when ye are in 



I 

( 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 143 

your fields, yea, over all your flocks; cry unto him in your houses, yea, over 
all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening; yea, cry unto him 
against the power of your enemies; yea, cry unto him against the devil, who 
is an enemy to all righteousness. Cry unto him over the crops of your 
fields, that ye may prosper in them; cry over the flocks of your fields, that 
they may increase. But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in 
your closets and your secret places and in your wilderness; yea, and when 
you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer 
unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those 
who are around you. And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, 
do not suppose this is all, for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn 
away the needy and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and 
impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need;. I say unto 
you, if ye do not anything of these things, behold, your prayer is vain and 
availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who deny the faith. 

I think that is very excellent doctrine, and I read it to impress 
upon your minds the season of prayer. The season of prayer is in the 
morning before the family separates. A good time for prayer is when 
you assemble at the table before you partake of the morning meal, and 
let the members of the family take turn in the praying. That is the 
season of prayer. The season of prayer for the merchant is in the 
morning when he goes to his place of business and before he begins his 
day's work, over his merchandise. The time of prayer for the shep- 
herd, is when he is out with his flocks watching over them. The 
time for the farmer to pray is when he goes with his plow into 
the field, when he goes to sow his grain, and when he goes to 
gather his harvest. And if a man will pray as he is commanded to do 
in this passage of scripture which I have read, then he more than likely 
will be found in all things righteously keeping the commandments of 
the Lord. He will not be found scheming to take advantage of his neigh- 
bor in some trade or bargain, but in all things dealing justly, because 
he has prayed in the morning and has in his heart the spirit of prayer 
throughout the day, that the Lord will bless him in the increase of his 
goods, of his fields, of his flocks, or whatever it may be he is engaged in. 
So that is the season of prayer. 

WHO DOES NOT PRAY IS TO BE HELD IN REMEMBRANCE BEFORE THE JUDGE 

But there is something more in this. It says, that the person in 
Zion or any of her stakes, for that is the way it' reads further up in 
this revelation, who does not pray before the Lord in the season 
thereof, is to be held in remembrance< before the judge of the people. 

THE TEACHERS TO SEE THAT THE PEOPLE PRAY. 

Now who is the judge of the people? It is your bishop. It is 
the duty of the teachers who come into your home to teach you and 
see that you pray. If you are not a praying man or a praying woman, 
then they have the right according to the law to take that message to 
the bishop of the ward, and tell him that you are not praying in your 



\ 



144 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

homes, and he can hold you in remembrance, and if you refuse to 
pray when you are taught ; if you will not hearken to the counsels of 
the teachers or of the common judge, then he has the right according 
to the law to take action against you for your fellowship in the Church, 
if he deems it wise. That is within his rights. The Lord has said 
it, and he said it because he wanted to impress upon our minds the 
importance of prayer. 

It would be a wonderful thing, of course, if all our brethren hold- 
ing the lesser Priesthood would magnify their callings, and if the bish- 
ops in the wards would see that they do, and give them some labor to 
perform.- That ought to be done. 

What is the duty of the teacher? As we read here in section 20 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, which was given the day the Church 
was organized, it is the duty of the teacher to visit the homes of the 
people, to teach them, to see that there is no iniquity in the Church; 
that there is no fault-finding one with another, no backbiting, no false 
speaking one against another, and, more than that, to see that the mem- 
bers, of the Church perform their duty. That great responsibility rests 
upon the teacher. He is to see that the members pray, that they fast 
upon -the fast day, that they are paying their tithing in the season 
thereof, that they are attending their fast meeting in the ward,* week 
by week, and all these things are required of the teacher as he visits in 
the homes of the people. And if the teacher does not see . to these 
things; then the sin lieth at his door. 

DUTIES OF THE PRIESTS. 

What are the duties of the priest? The duty of the priest is to 
preach, teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and administer the sacra- 
ment. He is to visit the house of each member and exhort all to 
pray, vocally and in secret, and attend to all family duties. That is 
the duty of the priest. 

Now the good bishops in the wards should see that their priests 
go into the homes of the people, and do this very thing, teaching the 
members in the spirit of prayer. When they find an individual mem- 
ber of the Church who fails in any one of these particulars, it is the 
right of these teachers or priests to make the report to the bishop, the 
common judge. However, they are to labor diligently, and with long 
suffering, in faith and humility, with these members who do not see 
the necessity of keeping the commandments of the Lord, and after 
they have done all in their power, and can do nothing further to ibring 
the non-praying members to repentance, the common judge may cite 
them before him, and he has the right to take action against them for 
their fellowship. Of course, our duty is to save souls. We must, not 
be hasty in casting any out. So, I say, after the teachers or the priests 
have done all that can be done, then the drastic measures may be meted 
out. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH.

ALL AMUSEMENTS SHOULD BE OPENED BY PRAYER. 

Another scripture, I will read from II Nephi 32, wherein it 
says : 1 i 

And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your 
hearts, and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For 
if ye would hearken unto the spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would 
know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but 
teacheth him that he must not pray. But behold, I say unto, you, that ye 
must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto 
the Lord, save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name 
of Christ, that he will consecrate the performance unto thee, that thy per- 
formance may be for the welfare of thy soul. 

Have we any right as Latter-day Saints who profess to keep the 
commandments of the Lord, to open our dances without prayer, or 
other amusements, and to close them in improper hours and without 
prayer? Have we that right, professing to be Latter-day Saints, keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord? I say unto you, No. It makes 
no difference whether it is pleasure, whether it is our daily labor, 
whether it is the service of the Lord in teaching the gospel and try- 
ing to save mankind. Whatever it may be, that thing should be con- 
secrated by prayer, and every \ performance, for the welfare of our 
souls. 

CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO PRAY. 

Now what were the consequences of not praying, as they are 
recorded in this book regarding the Nephite people? Let me tell 'you. 
In the very same chapter, and in the verse preceding where I read, 
Nephi says this : 

Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will -be no more doc- 
trine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. When 
he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall 
say unto you ye shall observe to do. And now I, Nephi, cannot say more. 

Why not? Because the people had refused to pray. Because 
they had hardened their hearts, even in his day. Therefore the Lord 
closed his mouth, and said, there shall be no more doctrine till Christ 
comes, so far as you are concerned, and I cannot say more, because the 
Lord won't permit it. 

"The spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn be- 
cause of the unbelief and the ignorance and the stiffneckedness of men, 
for they will not search knowledge nor understand great knowledge 
when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be." 
Now that applies in our day. We have members of the Church to 
whom this ought to be read. They are not here ; they do not come to 
conference. But men who have hardened their hearts, men who will 
not pray, men who will not search knowledge, who are not acquainted 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with the revelations of God as they have been made known unto us in 
these books and given unto us in this dispensation, notwithstanding 
the fact that the knowledge which has been given unto us is plain and 
easily to be understood. They shut their hearts against it, and refuse 
to search and to find that which the Lord has declared, which is for 
their eternal salvation and the salvation of all the world. Naturally 
such people are in darkness. We cannot afford to do that. 

THE- DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS IS FOR ALL THE WORLD. 

The Lord has given so many revelations, in our own day. We 
have this Doctrine and Covenants full of them, all pertaining unto the 
Latter-day Saints and to the world. . For this is not our book alone. 
This Doctrine and Covenants is my book and your book; but more 
than that, it belongs to all the world, to the Catholics, to the Presby- 
terians, to the Methodists, to the infidel, to the non-believer. It is his 
book if he will accept it, if he will receive it. The Lord has given it 
unto the world for their salvation. If you do not believe it, you read 
the first section in this book, the preface, and you will find that the 
Lord has sent this book and the things which it contains unto the 
people afar off, on the islands of the sea, in foreign lands, and his 
voice is unto all people, that all may hear. And so 1 say it belongs to 
all the world, not only to the Latter-day Saints, and they will be 
judged by it, and you will be judged by it. We will all be judged by it, 
by the things which this book contains and by the things which the 
other books contain which are holy scripture, which the Lord has given 
unto us ; and if we fail to comprehend these things, if we will not 
search, if we will not study, if we will not take hold on the things which 
the Lord has revealed unto us, then his condemnation shall rest upon 
us, and we^hall be removed from his presence and from his kingdom. 
And I say that in all soberness, because it is true. 

Now there is no time to say more. I have said all, perhaps, I 
should ; but still there is a great deal more that could be said. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us go home feeling a determina- 
tion in our hearts to serve the Lord. Remember that we are living 
in a critical period of the world's history. Great events are before us. 
The Lord in his mercy, and with justice and judgment, is going to 
cut short his work in righteousness. The decrees have gone forth, 
and it behooves us as members of the Church to be united and to serve 
him and keep all his commandments. This I pray we will do, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem : "Send out the Light." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph A. West.

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING. 

The second overflow meeting was held at the Assembly Hall 
Sunday, at 2 p. m. October 5, 1919. Elder George F. Richards, of 
the Council of the Twelve Apostles, presided. Music was furnished 
by the Richards ward choir of the Granite Stake of Zion. 

The choir sang: "As the Dew from Heaven Distilling," with 
solo by Ruby Child. 

As the dew, from heaven distilling, 

Gently on the grass descends, 
And revives it, thus fulfilling 

What Thy providence intends, 

Let Thy doctrine, Lord, so gracious, 

Thus decending from above, 
Blest by Thee, prove efficacious 

To fulfil Thy work of love. 

Lord, behold this congregation; 

Precious promises fulfil; 
From Thy holy habitation, 

Let' the dews of life distil. 

Let our cry come up before Thee; 

Thy sweet Spirit shed around: 
So the people shall adore Thee, 

And confess the joyful sound. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Levi M. Savage, of Woodruff, Ariz. 

The choir sang: "Grant us Peace, O Lord." 

The General Authorities of the Church were presented by El- 
der George F. Richards, as in the Tabernacle, and unanimously sus- 
tained. 

ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG 

(President of the Ensign Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters. I remember once to have heard an 
anecdote concerning what we usually term a sectarian minister, who 
stated that he was very sorry to disappoint the congregation, for he 
had not had time to prepare a sermon, and therefore would have to 
rely upon the Spirit of the Lord, an anecdote that illustrates, in part 
at least, the distinction between the churches of the day and the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In practically all Christian 
churches it is the practice that sermons should be prepared beforehand, 
whereas in bur Church we are told that aside from general prepara- 
tion we should give no thought, generally speaking, as to what we 
should say, and should rely upon the spirit of the occasion, the Spirit of 
the Lord. I very humbly desire that to my own meagre abilities 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there may be added the influence and the inspiration of that Spirit dur- 
ing the time alotted to me. 

The Saints, as we all believe, know the voice of the shepherd. 
You cannot fool the Latter-day Saints by talking glittering general- 
ities. A man may speak with the oratorical gifts of a Webster, and 
if he have not the Spirit of the Lord, the Saints know it, they feel it, 
and are not fed or satisfied. 

I am very happy to be here this afternoon, not to occupy this 
position (because I approach the performance of the responsibilities 
thereof with a sense of trepidation amounting almost to fear), but 
I am happy that I am counted among the membership of the Church 
and worthy of occupying some sort of a position in that Church. 

I was just looking over that wonderful poem, the Seer, written 
by President John Taylor, that remarkable, splendid father of President 
Frank Y. Taylor who is here today. I find written there, concerning 
the Prophet Joseph, that 

He shared their joys, their sorrows too, 
He loved the Saints, he loved Nauvoo. 

I have been away from this people long enough to develop a 
strong love for the Saints of God; the good- people who. make up the 
congregations of the Church are the dearest people in all the world to 
you and to me. There is no experience that touches my heart more 
deeply than the sight of the face of a good old brother or sister whom 
T have known, and known to be faithful, for many vears. I share 
their iovs and their sorrows, too/ I deeply love the Saints and their 
association, and am proud of being a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints- 

I was thinking: during the noon hour how much reason we all 
have to be proud of the record of the Church. When you stop to 
think about it, you must conclude that this Church has been right 
throughout its whole history upon all of the. important moral ques- 
tions that have affected our welfare. In the nature of things there is 
not within the United States a people more patriotic than the Latter- 
day Saints. I know of no other sect that assumes the position that the 
constitution of the United States was written as it were hv the very 
finger of God. Surely that belief is an inspiration to the highest pat- 
riotism. You remember reading in the history of the Church that this 
people were accused in Missouri of being opposed to slavery. In that 
slave-holding state such an attitude became one of the reasons of 
our persecution and drivings. You remember that the first message 
that flashed across the completed telegraph line from here to the At- 
lantic coast was a message of congratulation from Brig-ham Young to 
Abraham Lincoln, that the Union was preserved or was in the wav of 
preservation. 

President Grant spoke this morning of the attitude of the Nwaio 
Indians toward the "Mormons." They had confidence in the "Mor- 
mon" people because the "Mormon" people never had abused their 



ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG. 



149 



confidence. Books have been written, one book that I remember in 
particular, called A Century of Dishonor, an indictment covering 
hundreds of pages against the American people for treatment of the 
American Indians. But no indictment has ever been framed, or could 
be formulated against the "Mormon" people for their attitude or treat- 
ment of the aborigines of this continent. We have always treated 
them fairly and squarely, as of course th'ey should have been treated. 

We have stpod square upon women's suffrage. We were among 
the very first — the second as I now recall it — of the states to give what 
should have been given years before, the right of equal suffrage to 
the women, now recognized not only in this country but throughout 
the world as a long delayed measure of justice. 

We have stood fairly and squarely upon the prohibition question 
throughout the Church. 

We occupy an enviable position so far as the great subject of 
education is concerned. The Latter-day Saints are not afraid -of edu- 
cation; they do not fear that by the education of their children, at 
least by true education, they are going to educate them out of "Mor- 
monism." The Church has always stood, from the days of Kirtland 
to the present time, for universities, for colleges, for development, 
for a high state oL education; and our record, I say, in that respect is 
a very enviable one. 

We stand in what I think is a very commendable attitude with 
reference to labor, to laboring men, to what might be called the meek 
and the humble and the poor of the world. This Church has never 
been, and is not, any respecter of persons. Our congregations are 
made up in this city and everywhere of not merely those who are ,rich 
in the good's of this world, but those who are in moderate circum- 
stances and those who are poor, all worshiping God at the same shrine 
— a brotherhood of men and women worshiping under the auspices of 
a Church that welcomes' all men and treats all equally and fairly. 
The Church has not only a splendid record in that regard, but we have 
done much, very much, indeed, to help, to assist the poor and those 
who are not as fortunate as some of their brethren and sisters. And 
we look forward — and it is written down in our books here — to the 
time when there shall be community of interest among all the peo- 
ple of the Church. 

Indeed there are no more advanced conceptions of social justice 
anywhere extant in the world. And so I say and' repeat that we have 
reason to be proud of the record of the Church to which we belong. 

And now, if I may be pardoned for saying something upon a sub- 
ject which has received a great deal of attention at this conference, 
I think we may congratulate ourselves (and I speak with due defer- 
ence for the opinions of others), that we stand true; if I understand 
the sentiments of the brethren who preside over this Church and of 
the whole people of the Church, we stand true upon that great moral 
question designated as the League of Nations. Possibly enough has 
been said upon that subject. I have thought, however, that perhaps by

reason of the peculiar experiences that have been mine during the last 
two or three years, it might not be held to be improper for me to add 
a little to what has been said upon that subject. I desire first to say 
that nothing within recent years has astonished me quite so much as 
that opinions on this subject have been divided along lines of political 
cleavage. What is there in the controversy respecting the league of 
nations that calls for political division? It is beyond my comprehen- 
sion. Down through the decades of our history the Democratic party 
has stood for a strict construction of the constitution ; it has stood, gen- 
erally speaking, for states rights; and, in a way, for a large measure 
of free trade. While on the other hand the Republican party has stood 
for writing the word "Nation" as it is sometimes expressed with a big 
N. It has stood for broad' construction of the constitution and the pro- 
tection of American industries. These have been the lines of demarka- 
tion between the parties. But what is there in this league of nations that 
appeals to the historical differences that have separated these two 
great parties ? Nothing, so far as I have been able to discover. 

My justification for speaking a few words upon this subject this 
afternoon comes not only from the fact that it is the the key note of 
this conference, I may say, sounded by those who are my superiors in 
ecclesiastical authority, but from the fact also that my own concep- 
tions and attitude in respect of that subject were taken long before I 
dreamed that this would or could be a matter of political controversy 
between the great parties. Now we find ourselves confronted with 
the fact that in the United States Senate there are a few Democrats 
who are against the league, while the great bulk of them are for it- On 
the other hand, there are a few Republican Senators who stand for 
the league, with the great bulk of them against. I must confess that 
this condition leads me to the conclusion, which seems to me to be 
inevitable, that so far as the senate of the United States is concerned, 
the question in some way has become political, which it should not 
be, and which it is not in very truth and reason. I think we ought to 
approach our conclusions on this subject free from political affilia- 
tions, free from any political prejudices. 

It seems to me, as was stated this morning in the Tabernacle, 
that it would be a matter of chagrin to the Latter-day Saints to stand 
opposed to that which, as I conceive it, will bring about or contri- 
bute very largely to the bringing about of a reign of peace on the 
earth. We are the followers of him whose mission was announced as 
Peace on earth and good will to men. That is the spirit of Christian- 

I take it that there can be no question of the rejection of the 
treaty of peace of which the proposed constitution of the League of 
Nations forms a part. That certainly is not going to be done. The 
senate of the 'United States will not reject this peace pact outright. 
The consequences of such action are terrible to contemplate. Think 
what has been provided, within this treaty of peace. Think of the 
nations that have been erected along racial lines. Think of the right 



i

that has been extended to the nations of the world to determine, 
themselves, their own forms of government. There is Poland, what 
would become of Poland if this treaty were not approved? There is 
Jugo-Slavia — what would become of the Jugo-Slavs? What would 
become of Palestine, and what would become of the Armenians ? 
What would become of Alsace-Lorraine, and what of that part of 
Denmark which Germany stole some forty or fifty years ago? 

If this peace pact is not approved, then it must go back to Ger- 
' many. Can it be believed that Germany will approve now what she 
felt constrained to approve at the end of the war? Germany would 
demand more than she demanded at the first. The world will surely 
be in an indescribable condition of disorder. The German people and 
some who sympathize with them believe that the terms of peace were 
unduly harsh and hard. I do not believe it, and you do not believe it. 
Germany has not property enough, has not resources enough, nor the 
possibility of earning money enough, to compensate, nor indeed is 
there any possibility after suffering enough in any respect, to equal the 
wrongs that she has done in this great war. The terms that have been 
imposed upon her as a matter of fact are the very minimum of what 
could in justice have been imposed upon her. But if this thing is not 
to be approved, what will become of a world which has been framed 
anew under the American idea of the right of people to determine their 
own form of government? It is inconceivable that the treaty of peace 
should be rejected. Will it be amended so that it will have to go 
back for reconsideration? To amend it would bring about the same 
result as to reject it — the document would have to be considered 
again — and can there be any doubt as to what would be the result of 
that ? I can not believe that the Senate of the United States will make 
a single amendment. I certainly believe that the Senate of the United 
States should not approve an amendment to the treaty. Will they 
make any interpretations or reservations equivalent to an amendment? 
If they do, then the treaty must go back to the Peace Congress for 
reconsideration, for of course such interpretation, or reservation will 
have the effect o'f amendment and to that extent therefore will be ,a 
rejection of the treaty. It seems clear and incontestable that the 
great bulk of the people of the United States demand that the treaty 
shall be approved in the form and substance in which it is written, 
rather than to undo that which has been done and revert to the sorry 
conditions that existed before that treaty was made. 

What were those conditions? Why, there was no authority to 
curb the ambitions of any nation that had the desire to build up a 
great army, and construct great plants wherein guns and armor be 
made, nor to prevent a robber nation, when the time came, when the 
hour struck, attacking a weak neighbor, and stealing by main force 
a portion of its territory, as has been done many a time and oft 
by the great nation whose ambitions we have been fighting. Do we 
want that done? Do we not rather want a restraint placed upon all 
the nations of the earth? Look what is now happening. We are told 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the press dispatches this morning that war between Italy and the 
Jugo-Slavic nation is probable. That would not be possible, nor prob- 
able, if this league of peace were now in force — there would be the 
combined influence of the world to prevent that sort of thing. It is 
said that there are some 15 or 20 other wars now waging, waging be- 
cause the league is not in force. 

Gentlemen talk about our yielding up some of the sovereignty of 
the United States. I do not think that the objection is sound or well 
taken. But if so, then let us yield up so much of our sovereignty as 
may be necessary to the realization of a world peace. I yield up 
some of my sovereignity to the city government, to the police, under 
ordinances and laws that prevent me from treading on the toes of my 
neighbor, from taking his property, or intruding in his home. To that 
extent I yield up my sovereignty. The law says that I may not infringe 
upon the rights of my neighbor. There is a league, there is a treaty 
between you arid me, and between all the citizens of every law abiding 
country, under which each of us gives up some of his God-given sov- 
ereignty in order to preserve the weak from being overpowered by the 
strong. It is so in the government of the United States — the states 
are protected against foreign invasions. Nobody can violate the sov- 
erignty of this state or any state in the union but what the United 
States will come to its aid, so, in our municipal and state relations we 
are shielded by a sort of Article ten from outside interference. Why 
should not that principle be extended to the nations, so that when 
some big nation sees fit to rob one of the little nations of its territory 
of its liberties, there should be a world policeman who shall say, Thus 
far shalt thou go and no further? Shall we return to that unhappy, 
irrational, and unChristian condition where there was no restraint upon 
any nation, where force prevailed and might made right? 

Gentlemen say that the Shantung business is wrong. Suppose it 
is. Germany created it, France and England found it necessary to 
recognize it, and we and the world have inherited it. I believe the 
wrong has been largely righted, because the subject has been brought 
within the consideration and determination of the' Council of the 
League of Nations. 

Did you ever stop to think what was done when the constitution 
of the United States was formed? Why, slavery, which was bitterly 
opposed by the people of the Northern states when the constitution was 
formed, was perpetuated in the government of the United States, and 
for 20 years the people were peamitted to bring slaves from Africa into 
this country. It was a compromise, it was a moral compromise. The 
North gave up what they believed to be a very great moral principle 
in order to secure the constitution of the United States and its bless- 
ings. The Constitution was a league of free and independent col- 
onies and is filled with compromise from one end to another, including 
the right for the smallest of states to have an equal vote with the 
largest in the United States Senate. 

People say that we ought to be true to Washington in his declara- 



ELDER RICHARD IV. YOUNG. 



153 



tion that we should not make any entangling alliances. There are a 
great many things that Washington and the patriot forefath- 
ers did not foresee, or provide against, wise as they un- 
doubtedly were. There have been eighteen amendments to 
the constitution of the United States since it was first adopted. These 
provide for religious freedom, trial by jury, etc., etc., and now pro- 
viding for women's suffrage. Somebody stated humorously in the 
state senate the other day that it was Washington's idea and the idea 
of the fathers that only men should vote, and asked, why then extend 
the vote to women, or why extend it to negroes ? Washington's idea 
was that senators should be elected by the legislatures, then why now 
permit the people to elect senators by direct vote? There was no 
thought of prohibition in Washington's day, yet it is now written down 
in the constitution of the United States. The fact is that as time goes 
on new necessities arise, which should and must be met by the law and 
by the constitution. 

I believe there are a good many men who think that we would be 
giving up something of our Americanism if we approved of this league, 
who are perfectly honest and sincere in their opposition. But at the 
same time I must confess that I believe that the great bulk of those who 
oppose it are doing so for political reasons and considerations- 

1 am not authorized to speak on the subject for the men who served 
in the United States army: I do not know what their sentiments may 
be, on the whole. I know only 'this that so far as I have talked with 
men who wore the uniform in the late great war, they stand solidly 
for the league of nations. I do not of course pretend to have talked 
with all or very many of them. I made a little speech of welcome to 
the returning soldiers down here in one of the southern towns a few 
weeks ago, and when I got through a returned soldier got up to re- 
spond'. I did not know what he was going to say, 'but he made a very 
impassioned appeal for the League, and considerably amused the audi- 
ence by stating: "If you people do not approve this League, and we 
have another big war, why you fellows be consistent and go to the 
war and let us stay at home." 

These are, very hurriedly and incompletely, some of my sentiments, 
and I give them to you for what they are worth. It seems to me that 
this is the greatest crisis of decades. It seems to me that here is the 
opportunity, the first great chance, for the Christian people of the 
world to write Christianity into the Slipreme government of all the 
nations, and that to reject this opportunity and go back to the old 
order of things, where lawless force and unrestrained aggression held 
swav, to sro back to that condition of things, would be a crime. May 
the Lord have mercy on the souls of those who oppose it, not honestly 
but through political considerations. 

I cannot see why we should not try this thing out- If the event 
should demonstrate that the league needs amendment, like the con- 
stitution of the United States, let us amend it. If it needs amendment 
twice, let us twice amend it. If it needs amendment eighteen times, 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as did the constitution of the United States in order to make a more 
perfect and desirable government, let us amend it eighteen times, but 
don't reject it now. In conclusion, if you will permit something which 
sounds like profanity, but which is uttered reverently and with a pro- 
found sense of what I conceive to be our duty, for God's sake let us 
stand behind this league of nations. Amen. 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR 

(President of the Granite Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may 
direct my remarks to you this afternoon. I am in hearty accord with 
what has been presented to us in our conference, during the last three 
days. My heart has been filled with gratitude in witnessing the Spirit 
of the Lord that accompanied the speakers, and to feel the good spirit 
abiding in the congregations of the people. 

When Brother Young spoke this afternoon of what wonderful 
accomplishments had been made by us as a people, how we had been' 
in the fore-front in establishing the affirmative organizations before 
us in the past years, and of the wonderful opportunities that are before 
us as a people, I could not help but wonder if in the future we are going 
to be equal to every occasion that shall present itself to us ; and if we 
are really prepared to assume the responsibility that is upon the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to see to it that the message of 
Christ, the peace of salvation, shall be carried to the children of the 
earth ; and whether we are prepared to stand as an ensign to the na- 
tions of the earth and the peoples thereof, and show, by the fruits of 
our labors and the truth that is in us, that we ane indeed the children of 
the Lord our God, worthy of being his servants in proclaiming the 
word of the Lord to the children of men, and offering unto mankind 
that peace which comes from God, the eternal Father, and which means 
exaltation to his children in the earth ! Thinking of this in my own 
personal life, I wonder if I have measured up to the standard our 
heavenly Father expects of me, considering the opportunities that the 
gospel of Christ has presented to me ! I am concerned when I speak 
about it, wondering if I have lived the proper kind of a life. If I 
were to go out into the world to proclaim this work of God, and show 
before the children of men that I am a fruit of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, I wonder whether they could see in me a light and an ensign ; 
and that I could say, I have the truth, follow me. I hesitate, and I am 
in doubt concerning my own personal life, that I would be equal and 
measure up to that occasion. And yet, as a people we have accepted 
this mission and this calling in the earth, to see that the people of the 
earth are evangelized and warned to accept the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

What are we doing to bring about that splendid result ? We have 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



155 



been praying and looking forward for years and years, to the time 
when the doors of the world should be opened to our missionaries. We 
have only had a scant opportunity to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ 
to the nations of the earth. They would not receive our elders, in 
many parts of the earth. They have shut their 1 doors against us. But 
now, it appears, with the freedom that is being extended to the people, 
brought about by this terrible war, an opportunity is being presented 
to us to proclaim the gospel to the nations of the earth. I believe our 
boys and girls will be called out by the thousands in the near future, 
to stand before the world as an ensign to its peoples. Now, the thought 
that stirs me is, am I ready for that mission? Are we ready for that 
call? Are you prepared? Are you in a condition to go out before the 
children of men, and hold up your head and hands unafraid, un- 
ashamed, to declare : "I belong to the body of people known as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ; I have kept the com- 
mandments of the Lord my God, and I am here to aid in bringing 
about the gospel mission of peace !" Are you prepared in your own 
life? Are you preparing your boys and your girls honestly to pro- 
claim that indeed we are an ensign before all the children of men, 
and are keeping the commandments of the Lord our God? It seems 
to me that some of us are more anxious about the loaves and fishes — 
to get rich. We are more anxious to be seen of men in high places, 
rather than using our ability and strength and power to further the 
work of the Lord that it may spread in the nations of the earth, that 
other peoples in the world may have the chance to breathe this free- 
dom, to see this light, to comprehend this understanding, which we 
enjoy through the fruits of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

When I think of these things, I feel in my own soul that I am 
going to try to do better, to repent of the wrong I have done, so order 
my life that I shall keep the commandments of the Lord my God, so 
that whenever, or wherever I go the peoples of the world may 
see in me some good, and behold, in the great message which I pro- 
claim, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, that it bears good fruit. 

We owe much, my brethren and sisters, to the mission we have 
espoused. It behooves us to do right, to seek first the kingdom of 
God, and to do these things of which I have spoken. We should 
set our houses in order, put our affairs in shape so that at home, or 
wherever the Lord shall see fit to call us to go, we may be ready and 
able to proclaim in doctrine, precept and example this gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

I believe our boys and girls are going to have a wonderful oppor- 
tunity in the world. A great responsibility is going to devolve upon 
them, such as has never devolved upon any of us before; hence, all 
of us ought to set our lives in order, and see to it that we ourselves are 
keeping the commandments of God ; that we are clean and sweet and 
pure ; that we are living such lives that our boys may see within us the 
principles of rihteousness and truth, and that they may have an example 
to follow that shall be worthy, if they follow in our footsteps. 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



You will pardon my being personal ; but when I look back on my 
father's life, in relation to these matters, it is a wonderful inspiration to 
me, as the lives of your fathers^ and mothers undoubtedly have been to 
you. But when I think of the careful training that I had, of the won- 
derful example that was set before me, in my youth, I feel that it would 
be inexcusable fof me to do that which was not right in my life, be- 
cause I feel that I had a perfect example to follow. As a boy, how- 
ever, I have been tempted like other boys ; but my father's life was so 
free and pure and clean that whenever temptation was presented to me, 
it seemed like my father rose up before me in majesty, like a monument, 
and I could not do the wrong which I was tempted to do. I felt that I 
would bring displeasure upon him, and I know there was nothing in 
his life that would warrant me in taking a course that would not be 
acceptable before our Father in heaven. I felt, as I thought of his life, 
O, I would like to live that kind of a life myself, so that I would be a 
light in the darkness to my boys and girls ; that I might take a' course 
that my boys might have a straight and 'perfect path to follow, and 
never go in devious and crooked ways, and so grow up as clean, 
sweet Latter-day Saints. 

I tell you it is a noble calling to be known as a true, clean, sweet 
Latter-day Saint. It will mean salvation and exaltation to any soul who 
will live that kind of a life, and endure. As a father I feel, and you 
as fathers feel, how important it is that we set before our boys and 
girls a perfect example, that they may lead such lives as will guide 
them to life and salvation, and never be ashamed, at any time, of what 
they are doing. Every father owes it to the manhood within his boy, 
that he shall so live that when that boy sees his example, and walks in 
his footsteps, the boy can hold up his head and hands and say, Thank 
God, that is my father ! • Any man who lives short of that is not living 
up to the expectancy of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to 
the furtherance of the strength and manhood of the boys and girls we 
are rearing. 

I think, too, that as a priesthood, and as men, we owe more of our 
spirit and strength and ability and power to our boys and girls than 
we are giving to them. It does not make much difference to you and to 
me whether we have much in our barns, or have flocks, or herds, or 
of the world's material things around us, or what the honors of the 
world may be to us, whether we live in a big house or a little one. It 
does not mean much to us ; but it does matter much what our boys and 
girls are doing, and whether they are taking the course that will bring 
joy and happiness to us all the days of our lives. 

What a wonderful happiness comes to a father who sees his boy 
grow up from infancy to manhood, clean and sweet and pure, with 
virtue written upon his forehead, and manly acts engraved upon every- 
thing that he does upon the earth. Isn't that worth the best efforts 
we can put forth in this world? 

The Lord expects that we shall bring our boys up in the fear, 
the favor, and the faith of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I

sometimes think that we are more concerned about our flocks and our 
herds and our riches, and to be seen and honored of men, than we are 
of the welfare of our children, and that we may have around us boys 
and girls who are keeping the commandments of the Lord our God. 

Sitting in a business house one day, a man passed the store. I was 
talking with the proprietor of the business, and the man passed the 
window ; and this passing man was rather "down at the heel," as we 
say. His trousers were frayed, his hat was a little torn, and his head 
was bowed down. He looked rather discouraged. As he passed, th« 
business man pointed to him and said, "Brother Taylor, there goes a 
failure in life." 

The remark hurt me a little, and I said, "I don't know ; it depends 
upon what you call a failure. I think I know the man, perhaps, better 
than you do. It is true he has not worldly goods about him, and he has, 
perhaps, lost about all he had of earthly things, as far as wealth goes ; 
but he has done a wonderful thing in our community.' I know him 
well. He has been out in the waste places, and subdued them, made 
them blossom as the rose. He has become a pioneer in this way, and 
has done all this where he has gone. As soon as a place became so that 
the people could prosper there, he moved on and tried again ; until he 
has made many places blossom as the rose. In this community, too, I 
know he has been a thinker, he has been a reader, he has been a progres- 
sive fellow ; and wherever he has lived he has encouraged boys and girls 
to go to schools and to universities. He has awakened ambition within 
the hearts of boys and girls. He is a goad Latter-day Saint, too, arid 
he has taught men the word of the Lord our God. Not only that, but 
better than all that, he has gathered around him his boys and girls ; he 
knows the heart of every one of them, and' they know him. They are 
companions to him, and he is a companion to them. They love him, 
they honor him, respect him, and he has a splendid, large family. It 
is true he has not given them much wealth, but every boy and girl that 
he has is a Latter-day Saint, — a credit to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. They are clean and sweet boys and girls ! He 
loves his fellow men; and, you will pardon me, I know you are my 
friend, but if I were, 'right up against it,' as we say, not knowing 
where to go for something to eat, and needed a little help, and I just 
had two friends to go to, that man that you call a failure in life, as be- 
tween you and him, I would go to that man !" 

Said he, "Why, he couldn't help you ; he has nothing to help you 
with." 

"But," said I, "he would divide with me that which he had. I feel 
that he has been a success and not a failure, he has gained eternal 
riches, he has stored where moth and rust do not corrupt, nor thieves 
break through and steal." 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, we owe to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints that we do the right, that we live lives that 
will reflect credit upon it, and that we teach our boys and girls the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, arid that we teach them to be clean and

sweet and pure, in the sight of all men, because unless they are clean, 
all these other things will not amount to much in their lives. 

I love the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I love the Latter-day 
Saints. I love our boys and our girls ; and O, how I would like to see 
them measure up in purity, faith, and righteousness, and I am sure they 
will, because the Lord will so order it that they will meet any require- 
ment, and as they grow older and bigger and stronger they will stand 
up just like our leaders have done, and become an ensign for the sal- 
vation of the children of men, — which I pray may be their lot, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

(President of the Deseret Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters. I sincerely pray that the Lord will calm 
my spirit, and give me his Holy Spirit, so that I shall not say anything 
that will detract in any way from the splendid influence and' spirit of 
this conference gathering. I am able to say that I am in perfect ac- 
cord with the spirit and teachings of this conference. I am very grate- 
ful to the Lord that I have been permitted to meet with you and 
have again a birth of the spirit, and be renewed in my desires and deter- 
mination to serve the Lord and keep his commandments, and enjoy 
his blessings. I feel full of thanksgiving and appreciation unto the 
Lord upon this occasion. 

It has been my blessed privilege to come with eight members of 
my family to enjoy this splendid occasion. Four years ago, this Octo- 
ber, the mother and father and the children that are here upon this oc- 
casion were here to bid farewell to the oldest son of the family and 
wish him God speed upon his journey to New Zealand. We are here 
today to bid him welcome home from that field of labor. I hope you 
will pardon me for indulging in this kind of personal or family talk, but 
I stand before you as a father in Israel, one whose heart is full of thanks- 
giving, and I take it that it is fitting and proper that I should offer 
thanksgiving, even at this time, unto the Lord. The other night when 
that missionary boy crawled in bed with his father, the first time for 
four years and more, he said : 

"Father, it has been a long time, hasn't it?" 

"Yes," said I, "It has been a long time, son ; but, oh, how rapidly 
that time has gone and how grateful to the Lord, I have been 
every day, that he has permitted you to be out in his service. When I 
awoke in the morning I discovered that boy's head on my arm while 
he still slept, and thought if he could but know what a warm pulsation 
of this father's heart that is his, and how I lie here offering thanks-

giving unto God for him, how anxious he would be that he should 
never falter, never fall back, never lose that spirit and that sweetness 
which characterize him now. I have witnessed the return of our young ' 
men, whom we followed with faith and prayer to the field of battle, or 
wherever they have been during these past years of trouble and sorrow, 
war and bloodshed. I have seen some of them return, in many cases, 
thank God', pure and sweet and clean as they were when they left, hav- 
ing been so protected that they have not forgotten the teaching of the 
Church, of their fathers and mothers, and the influence that has sus- 
tained them. They have been mindful of their dependence upon the 
God of war as well as the God of peace, and the God of righteous- 
ness. When I have seen that kind of men come, back, and I have met 
many of them, O how my heart has rejoiced! 

But now, permit me to speak for a moment for some of them 
who, surrounded with temptations, were not able to stand. Perhaps, • 
when I speak of the conditions that obtain in the Deseret stake of Zion, 
it will be somewhat like the conditions that obtain in other stakes of 
Zion. Some of these boys have come back with the stain of tobacco 
upon their fingers. Some of them have come back regretting that 
they are not just as clean and sweet as they were when they went away. 
It is for this class that I would speak. O, what a lesson the Savior 
taught when he told us of the ninety-nine that were safely gathered and 
the one that was astray ; how he would go out and hunt for him who 
was astray, and when he found him, what rejoicing there would be! 
I plead for leniency for the boy, and bespeak for him the kind and 
tender care of the authorities of the Church. I say that it is the Lord 
that reaches out for men, and does not allow them to go back discour- 
aged and feel that all is lost. I feel that it is from the devil when any 
spirit comes to a boy or a man, a girl or a woman, and they feel that 
they are lost, and that they cannot climb back into full recognition. 

How my heart did thrill this morning, in that Mutual Improvement 
meeting, when Brother B. F. Grant stated that he was the son of a 
prophet, a man who stood beside Brigham Young as a counselor, and 
his mother was one of the choice souls in the early days of the Church ; 
that for thirty-nine years of his life he got off wrong, and he continued 
to go wrong, believing that there was nothing in this gospel which the 
Lord God has restored in these the last days, until, stricken with sor- 
row, he looked upon the lifeless form of his little girl, his own flesh 
and blood, and then he said, "O God, can it be possible that this is the 
end, and that I shall see her no more?" To which the Spirit made 
reply, "It cannot be, this is not the end !" And then came into his life 
the day of repentance, the day of cleansing himself, purifying himself, 
the hours and the days of prayer. The Lord brought him back, until 
he stands now and bears a testimony of the Lord's wonderful goodness 
unto him ! 

So I say, I plead for those boys. I like the spirit that is exempli- 
fied in the parable of the prodigal son. I think when I read that para- 
ble sometimes that I can almost see and feel what it must have meant 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to that father to' have his son stand up before him and say, "O father." 
Perhaps he did not like everything that was going on in that family. 
Perhaps it was too slow, the boy thought, for him. Perhaps the boy 
was self-wise, and thought, "If you will but let me go and cut loose 
from the family, I would soon make good. If you will, father, divide 
unto me the portion that belongeth to me." I imagine that I can feel 
it. I feel that if such a circumstance should arise in my own family, 
I can imagine what sort of spirit and feelings would be in my own 
heart, when I would look upon my own flesh and blood, and I would 
be forced to say, "O son, after we have given all that we had unto our 
family, are you yet dissatisfied? Do you want to take the meagre por- 
tion that is yours and leave us and go ?" If he should say, "Yes, give 
it to me, father, and let me go." How would I feel if he would not re- 
pent, and he should go ? But I imagine that father watching, waiting, 
praying. Doesn't the Savior give us to understand in that parable out- 
lining the very nature of things as they exist? Does he not say that 
the father saw the son approaching from afar? He was looking for 
the son that was away. He could not rest while there was one link 
of that family chain away. So he saw him as he approached from the 
distance, and he called them to go and kill the fatted calf, and he 
placed a mantle upon him, and a ring upon his finger, and he rejoiced. I 
think I can imagine in this world of selfishness, perhaps a little, what 
might be the feelings of a dutiful son who had witnessed that boy go 
off, who had witnessed the anguish of the father and the mother and 
the family. Now when he comes back that dutiful son hears the sound 
of rejoicing in the home. Calling to a servant, he asks, "What is this?" 
"O, your brother has returned, and your father and all are happy, and 
they are making merry." I think I can imagine what principle dom- 
inated the boy when he ""should say: "Is that so? And here I have 
been at home with father and mother, have toiled and labored this long 
time, and they have not so much as killed a kid for me ! And now when 
he comes home, after having wasted his money and all that he had in 
riotous living, here they are feasting with him !" 

Oh, but that father's heart burned, a true father's heart, and, he 
answered: "Son, thou hast been with me always; all that I have is 
thine; but this boy who was dead to us, this boy who was lost, he is 
back again." That is the spirit ; that is the lesson that I think we should 
have in our hearts now. Not one boy should be lost! I cannot con- 
ceive of the father that can say, he is gone ! I don't believe that such a 
mother exists- who feels that they are gone, and that she will not get 
them back. 

The other day in your city, I walked up to an old man whom I saw 
out on the street^ and I tapped him on the back and said, "Brother 
Crackles, how are you ?" And he looked up and said, "Brother Hinck- 
ley, would you come out here in the street and speak to me?" "Why 
not, Brother Crackles ? Don't I know you ?" "Oh, yes, you know me, 
and I am working for an honest living." Then he said to me, "I have 
a message for you : Richard has come back to the Church, clean, pure, 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 161 



sweet and repentant." Then I recalled that I had heard him stand up 
in fast meeting, in his home ward, and bear a testimony something like 
this: After testifying of the goodness of the Lord unto him and his 
family, he broke down and said, "But one is gone, but he will come 
back ! Mother and I never retire but what we bend the knee, and ask 
the Father of all to bring Richard back to us, and he will come back !" 
I tell you that faith did not go unrewarded ; Richard has come back ! 

Let us take it to heart, my brethren and sisters, that the boy that 
would go and offer his life for you and for me and for the cause of 
liberty and right will not be lost, if you and I do our full part, for 
the Lord will reach out after him, and he will bring him back. 

Let us stand for that M. I. A. slogan. Let the fathers and the 
mothers be at the sacramental table of the Lord. Let them renew their 
covenants before the Lord ; and let us remember, every one of us, the 
lessons of this conference that have beeh repeated over and over, that 
there is a law irrevocably decreed in the heavens, before the foundations 
of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated, and whenever we 
receive any blessing from God it is by obedience unto the law upon 
which that blessing is predicated. Let us then so live that if we want 
the blessings of life, health and strength, as Elder Richard R. Lyman 
outlined to us this morning, we may be able to say unto the Lord, we 
have obeyed the law upon which this blessing is predicated. Let us upon 
the sacred Sabbath day be able to say to the Lord when we think of the 
blessings that are promised, predicated upon proper observance of the 
Sabbath day, and say it in humility, we have obeyed the law upon which 
these blessings are predicated. When we know what we get from 
prayer, let us be able to say unto the Lord, we have obeyed the law of 
prayer upon which the blessings that come from prayer are predicated. 

Do not count any boy or girl lost. They are not. Brother Tal- 
mage stated at our conference, a week ago today, as a servant of the 
Lord, and I wrote it down, and read it to him after the meeting was 
over and he said I had it recorded correctly: "I promise the Saints in 
the Deseret stake of Zion that if their lives are such that they can look 
their sons and daughters in the face, arid if any of them have gone 
astray, that the parents are able to say, Tt is contrary to my instruction 
and my life's example ; it is against every effort of love, long suffering, 
faith, prayer and devotion that that boy or that girl has gone,' — I 
promise you, fathers and mothers, that not one of them shall be lost 
unless they have sinned away the power to repent." I don't believe 
any of our boys are in that lamentable condition. 

My brethren and sisters, I stand before you as one having a knowl- 
edge, a testimony, of the divinity of this great work of God. I stand 
before you like Brother Taylor, offering thanks unto God for the sainted 
and good father which I had, and mother also. I trust that when I 
have finished my work upon the earth I can reach out and grasp the 
hand of my father and can say unto him honestly: "Father, I have 
walked in the path that thou didst walk in, and the Lord has brought 
me home to thee." May it be thus with us, for our fathers and for 



162

ourselves and for our children and our children's children, I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

THE MISTAKE OF SAYING TOO MUCH. ■ 

When General Young related the anecdote of the sectarian min- 
ister who said, "I have not had time to prepare a sermon, and shall 
therefore have to depend upon the Spirit of the Lord," I thought, what 
a oity that minister did not know where to stop. Had he been content 
with saying, "I have not prepared a sermon," he would have escaped 
the ludicrous situation resulting from his having said a little too much. 
It reminded me of the woman who composed an epitaph for her dead 
husband. First, she wrote : "Rest in peace," and then added, "until we 
meet again." (Laughter.) 

.WHY AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED AND THIS NATION FOUNDED. 

If there is one thing I am proud of, it is that I am a Latter-day 
Saint, or one who professes the principles of a Latter-day Saint ; and, 
next to that, I am proud of being an American. I love my country, I 
love its institutions, and desire with my whole heart that our glorious 
nation shall go on to the fiulfilment of its God-given destiny. 

I believe God inspired Columbus to discover this land, that a nation 
might rise and flourish here — a nation dedicated to freedom and equal 
rights, including the right to worship God in obedience to the dictates of 
conscience; and I believe that this nation was founded that the great 
work of God might come forth and not be crushed out by the tyranny 
of men. 

I believe, also, that what God has committed to us, both as a 
Church and as a Nation, we owe to the rest of mankind, so far as they 
can be induced by peaceful persuasion to accept our principles. This 
Church has a mission to evangelize the world with the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, "the perfect law of liberty ;" and I have always dreamed 
that our Nation has a mission not merely to receive into its bosom the 
outcast, the refugee, the oppressed of other nations, but also to leaven 
with American principles the rest of the world. 

"LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD." 

At the mouth of New York harbor there stands a mammoth statue 
— a woman holding aloft a torch. This statue, the gift of the French 
republic to the American republic, is entitled "Liberty Enlightening the 
World." I regard that as a prophecy of the mission of America; and 
I desire that the prophecy shall be fulfilled.

THE UNITED STATES TYPICAL OF A UNITED WORLD. 

In the Constitutional Convention, when the fundamental law was 
framed upon which the State of Utah now stands, I stood for Woman 
Suffrage, because I believe it to be a principle of freedom and justice, 
and I there voiced the conviction that the union of these states was a 
type arid a foreshadowing of the union of the nations of the world. 
Somehow I drank in this idea from my boyhood. I cannot see it in any 
other light. 

LOWELL ON FREEDOM. 

I am heart and soul in sympathy with those beautiful lines of 
Lowell's, entitled "Stanzas on Freedom," inspired by an incident that 
happened during the Civil War. A poor negro woman had escaped 
from bondage, and had made her way into the State of Massachu- 
setts, "the cradle of freedom-" The law provided for the return of 
a fugitive slave, and she was pursued, apprehended, and dragged 
back into slavery. This incident so fired the soul of James Russell 
Lowell that he poured forth this indignant and eloquent protest : 

Men! whose boast it is that ye 
Come of fathers brave and free, 
If there breathe on earth a slave, 
Are ye truly free and brave? 
If ye do not feel the chain, 
When it works a brother's pain, 
Are ye not base slaves indeed, 
Slaves unworthy to be freed? 

Women! who shall one day bear 
Sons to breathe New England air, 
If ye hear, without a blush, 
Deeds to make the roused blood rush 
v Like red lava through your veins, 

For your sisters now in chains, — 
Answer! are ye fit to be 
Mothers of the brave and free? 

Is true Freedom but to break 
Fetters for our own dear sake, 
And, with leathern hearts, forget 
That we owe mankind a debt? 
No! true freedom is to- share 
All the chains rour brothers wear, 
And, with heart and hand, to be 
Earnest to make others free! 

They are slaves who fear to speak 
For the fallen and the weak; 
They are slaves who will not choose 
Hatred, scoffing, and abuse, 
Rather than in silence shrink 
From the truth they needs must think; 
They are slaves who dare not be 
In the right with two or three." 

Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

I was somewhat ' startled, my brethren and sisters, with the sud- 
den conclusion of Elder Whitney's remarks, and told him that they 
were short and sweet. 

It is good, on reading or hearing the truth, to be able to assent 
unto it, to feel it, and to be able to present it to others so that they 
also can feel it. This meeting has been, to me, one of both pleasure 
and profit. The words spoken have been actuated by the Spirit of 
the Lord. My heart has been touched and I have been moved to 
tears by the impressive manner in which some of the truths of the 
gospel were presented this afternoon. We have heard how peace 
may be brought into our lives and into our homes, to the Nations and 
to the world. Permit me to add a few words in conclusion of the 
meeting- 

We should be sympathetic for one another and especially for 
those who have great sorrows to bear. While riding on a railway 
train in England on my way to attend a conference, I overheard a 
conversation between two young women, in which one was heard to 
say that she had lost three brothers in the war. The other, after 
expressing deep sympathy, said four in her family had been killed. 
The European countries suffered very much more from the war than 
did our own country, and it does not suit my feelings to hear Ameri- 
cans speak of England, France, and their allies who fought side by 
side with us and suffered more than we, as rogues who can not be 
trusted in . a League to prevent a repetition of such terrible expe- 
riences. 

I am thankful that the victory came with no more loss of life 
among our own boys. It might easily have been otherwise. Had 
my family and I been living in England at the outbreak of the 
war, my three married sons and at least four of my sons-in-law would 
most likely have been at the front and possibly all of them would have 
been wounded or killed. I acknowledge the hand of the Lord in 
our preservation and praise and thank him for his blessing to me and 
mine and to you and yours who were spared. I trust that the right- 
eous blood shed during that awful conflict may have a sanctifying 
influence upon the countries involved and make precious to them the 
principles of freedom and liberty for which that blood was shed. 
The Lord told Joseph Smith that He had redeemed this land by the 
shedding of blood. Is it not possible that by the blood shed in Europe 
during the war, the countries there affected will be redeemed, and 
as the United States was prepared by the establishment of principles 
of freedom and justice as a place in which to receive Christ's Church 
and Kingdom and his gospel, so the nations of Europe may be pre- 
pared to receive the King of all and a reign of universal peace? I 
think the war was not necessary, however, and that it ought never to 
have been. I believe that it would have been averted had there been

165 



in existence a League of Nations, such as is proposed in connection 
with the peace treaty- 

I am sure that had the energies of all the men and money em- 
ployed in waging the war been directed towards bettering condi- 
tions for humanity in ways indicated by the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
instead of war and all its attendant sorrows, sufferings, and losses, 
we would have had universal peace and good will throughout the 
world. The gospel teaches us to love the Lord with all our hearts 
"and our neighbors as ourselves ; to serve the Lord and our fellow- 
men, being willing to deny ourselves and sacrifice for others even to 
the laying down of our lives if need be. If the world would obey 
the gospel and adopt these principles and live by them it would mean 
peace to individuals, peace to the world, and would bring to men glory, 
exaltation and eternal life. This is my testimony which T bear to 
you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang : "Our Valley Home," Myrtle Doelle, soloist. 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Rodney C. Badger, of 
the Salt Lake Stake of Zion. 



THIRD OVERFLOW MEETING. 

The third overflow meeting was held in Barratt Hall, Sunday 
2 p. m., Octooer 5, 1919, Elder David O. McKay, of the Council of 
the Twelve Apostles, presiding. The music was furnished by the L. 
D. S. High School Choir, P. Melvin Peterson, director. 

The choir sang : "The Lord in strength victorious." 

Prayer by Elder Harden Bennion, of Vernal, Utah, Uintah stake, 
and secretary of the State of Utah. 

The choir sang: "Rejoice, the Lord is King." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN 

(President of the Alpine Stake of Zion) 

My beloved brethren and sisters. I trust that the few moments 
I occupy I may enjoy the influence of our heavenly Father, for I 
certainly feel that I need his divine aid this afternoon. I have re- 
joiced exceedingly in the spirit of the meetings thus far during the 
sessions of the conference. I have been built up in the faith, have 
been encouraged in the labors that devolve upon me, and have made 
some silent resolutions, to be more diligent, if possible, in carrying on 
the work that rests upon my shoulders when I return to our stake of 
Zion. The Alpine stake of Zion is located in the north end of Utah 
county. There are seventeen wards in the stake. We are some- 
what compact, and we can visit every ward in our stake and, if neces- 
sary, return home that same evening. When I hear the reports of 
some of our brethren who are compelled to make long journeys and 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to devote a great deal of time away from home in looking after 
the work, I feel to appreciate our own locality and the stake where 
I live, and ought not to complain at the labors and duties that nat- 
urally rest upon the officers in the stakes of Zion. 

I was' very much impressed last evening when Elder Ivins spoke 
of the slogan for the Mutual Improvement Associations : Spiritual 
growth through attendance at sacrament meetings. I thought perhaps 
if we all could sense the importance of this, as the bishop of the ward 
does, that we would sometimes make an extra effort to be present 
at the sacrament meetings, in order that the bishop may appreciate 
our attendance, and we may improve from the fact that we are where 
we can receive the word of the Lord and partake of the influence of 
his holy Spirit. I realize that in our stake of Zion we have a very 
low average in attendance at our sacrament meetings, and I have 
tried to figure out why it is. Sometimes I have heard said that if 
they had the right kind of a bishop the attendance at the sacrament 
meetings would be better; and then I have sized up the men who 
preside in our stake of Zion, in the various wards throughout, and 
I know that we have a class of splendid men as bishops in our stake 
of Zion. I know, too, that they are faithful, that they are regular in 
their attendance. I have heard some say that if the bishop would 
call the meeting to order and commence on time, they wouldn't mind 
going to meeting, but it is usually started late ; but I know of bishops 
in our stake of Zion who are prompt in commencing their meetings, 
and yet the benches are empty. Some have said that if they had a 
good meeting house where they could go and have comfortable seats 
they wouldn't mind attending the meetings, but we have proven that 
that is not successful; for, since I have been called upon to act as the 
president of this stake, we have erected quite a number of beautiful 
buildings with splendid seats, and yet we find that the attendance at 
the sacrament meetings is very slim. We formed the habit of 
reading a little scripture in our wards just preparatory to calling up- 
on the brethren, or having those who were called upon to take part, 
and we thought perhaps that might induoe the Saints to be more 
diligent in reading the scriptures, but some of the Saints began to 
complain that they could, read the scriptures at home. Thus we find 
some in our stake of Zion who are very hard to please, it matters 
little whether we have a good building, splendid seats, a bishop who 
is prompt in commencing his meetings on time, who is exemplary in 
his habits, or not, the attendance remains about the same. Some- 
times when we have speakers announced, who are noted for their 
ability to interest the people, we will increase our attendance, and this 
thought I believe is one that is important to the brethren who preside ; 
if they could realize that it is necessary to prepare to feed the people 
and to give them the principles of the gospel, though we are com- 
pelled to go outside of the ward sometimes to get speakers to come 
in who will bring the people out and interest them in the meetings, 
we might succeed. Of course, I realize, at the same time, that if the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN. • 167 



Saints had a burning desire within -their hearts to be fed with the 
bread of life, it would not matter whether they were going to have 
a speaker they were not accustomed to hearing, nor not ; they would 
nevertheless go there to partake of the spirit and influence of the 
meeting. If they went with that desire, with a prayer in their hearts 
that they would be fed, I am sure that they would be built up in their 
faith and encouraged in their labors. 

For, after all, my brethren and sisters, it isn't altogether the 
person who stands before the congregations of Latter-day Saints 
to instruct them, but it is the spirit that we have, and the spirit that 
the speaker has, that impresses us and makes us feel that the gospel 
of Jesus Christ is worth living for and if necessary worth dying for. 
I think the bishops ought to try to make the meetings just as inter- 
esting as it is possible. I believe that they ought to meet at least once 
every week, at a stated time, and plan their work, and go over 
the affairs of the ward, to discover what is needed, and the best meth- 
od to adopt in order to secure a better attendance and in order to 
instruct and inform the Saints of the ward upon points that are so 
much needed. 

I believe that we do not use the magazines of the Church enough 
in our meetings. I am at meeting every Sunday somewhere in our 
stake of Zion, unless we are at a general conference, and I seldom 
ever hear a selection read from the magazines of the Church. I am 
sure that where the Saints are taking them and reading them, there 
is plenty of food for reflection in every magazine that we receive, 
and I am sure that if we would read them, we would be better able 
to keep in touch with the workings of the Church, and with the re- 
quirements and the desires of the authorities of the Church who 
preside over us. 

I believe the young people can be used in our sacramept meet- 
ings, and with a little judicious thought and careful planning that 
they can be brought in to have experience vital to them, in the read- 
ing of these selections that are short and to the point that we have 
published from time to time, and thus give the young people an op- 
portunity of using their voices in public and getting accustomed to 
speaking to the the people, by reading these selections ; and if neces- 
sary, they might speak upon the points about which they read. I 
think, too, that in almost all our wards, we have young people who 
have abilities along ,the line of singing, of playing musical instru- 
ments, who could be brought in to make our sacrament meetings more 
interesting, so as to" hold the young people. And we find that the 
young people do not attend the sacrament meetings as faithfully as 
we expect them to, and as we believe they should. We have well 
attended Sabbath school meetings. The young people are there, and 
we appreciate that fact, and we realize also" that young people are 
not able to appreciate, perhaps, as many of the older people are, the 
principles of the gospel talked upon and about; but we are sure that 
if they would form the habit they would obtain valuable informa- 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion, and if they would partake of the spirit that we have in our meet- 
ings, they would feel it and it would keep them, so to speak, well 
cared for during - their youthful days. 

And I believe that we should more diligently seek the Lord ; 
be more anxious to know concerning his work. We should have a 
desire in our hearts to know whether the gospel of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is of divine origin or not. We hear our brethren 
testify from time to time that they know that it is true, but if we 
want a testimony for ourselves, I believe that it is necessary that we 
seek the Lord for that testimony. "Ask and ye shall receive," and if 
we have a desire in our hearts, to be strengthened and to receive 
testimonies concerning this great latter-day work, if we desire it 
earnestly enough, and will attend our meetings and pray to the Lord 
in sincerity and truth, he will give us a testimony of the work which 
will be a strength to us and will help us to defend it and to stand by 
it and support those who are leading amongst us. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I do not desire to take more time 
than is necessary and due me, but I would like to bear my testimony, 
and to give you a testimony that I received last winter, that gave me 
great strength. A young lady came to me last winter and said : 

"I would like to have you and President Clark and Patriarch 
Warren B. Smith" (who was formerly the bishop) "go over to Lehi" 
(a distance of three miles) "and administer to a lady who is very 
sick." 

I said, "Why, they have brethren over there who are just as 
good as we are, and I don't know why we should go over there." 

She said, "Well, I just feel that if you brethren will go over there 
and administer to that girl, she. will get better." 

"Well, if it is all right with the brethren over there, why it will 
be all right." 

So we went over, and we met at the home where the girl was 
sick, and when we went into the room the grandfather of the girl 
came to the door. He said, "Now, brethren, this is a very peculiar 
sickness that this young lady has ; she is out of her mind, she doesn't 
know what she is doing, and if she knows you brethren are here, we 
will not be able to hold her ; you can come in, she is in the next 
room." We went in; a cousin of the young lady was present; also 
one of our brethren, a member of our high council; also President 
Abel John Evans. We heard the statement of the grandfather and 
of the mother of the girl. She had been in this condition for nearly 
two weeks ; they had been unable to control her. She refused to talk, 
and she was able to eat but very little, except what they could induce 
her to eat, with a great deal of effort, to maintain her existence. When 
we sat there deliberating upon what we should do, we thought per- 
haps she was possessed of evil spirits, and we remembered the saying 
of the Savior that this healing or administration should be done 
with fasting and prayer. We sat there deliberating upon the subiect 



ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIP MAN. 



169 



whether we ought to fast' and pray first before we administered, or 
whether we ought to administer immediately to her. As we did so 
" the thought came to us that if we let brother so and so go 
in, with whom she is acquainted, perhaps he could pacify her. As soon 
as we had decided that this brother should go in and talk to her, she 
sprang out of the arms of those who were trying to hold her and 
opened the door into the room where we were, then counted just like 
that (illustrating), and she went back and wrote on a piece of paper, 
"five evil spirits," and then she wrote underneath these words : "I don't 
want brother so and so to come in here; I hate him." Now how 
she knew that we had decided on that brother to go into that room 
I don't know, but after a great deal of persuasion the little girl who 
came to get us persuaded her to let a couple of the brethren come in 
and administer to her, and she said she would, and wrote it down. 
When the brethren went in she was standing with her face toward 
the wall ; wouldn't look at them ; they couldn't get her to sit down, but 
with the persuasion of this young lady, who seemed to have a great 
deal of influence with her, they persuaded her to sit down on a chair, 
and one of the brethren anointed her head with oil and the other 
brother confirmed the anointing and commanded and demanded that 
the evil spirit depart from her body and leave the room, when she 
?aftk riown just like a limp rag. It was necessary to pick her up and 
place her on the lounge. She lay there just as weak as she could pos- 
sibly be, without any strength, and before this, my brethren and 
sisters, the grandfather told me that he had strained his wrists try- 
ing to hold her, she was so strong. 

About the third day after this administration, I received a tele- 
phone message to come to the home of this young lady who wanted us 
to go and administer to this girl, and I went up to the home, and when 
I arrived there, this young lady who had been administered to was 
present, just as well and normal as we are here now, talked sensiblv, 
and has been well ever since. Now, my brethren and sisters, I tell 
you this incident that the young people of Zion may know that the 
gifts of the gospel, promised to the believers, are with the Latter- 
day Saints, in order that they may be encouraged and feel that there 
is power in the Priesthood. 

We ought to honor our brethren who preside in our wards and 
stakes, and in the Church, uphold their hands, and try to carry out 
the requirements made of us, no matter how small. If we will do 
this, I will promise you, having had now a great deal of experience 
in this work, having noticed the growth of our young people in the 
Church, that if the young men and young women will fasten on to 
the work and labor at it with a desire to know the truth, they will 
grow in graoe and in a knowledge of the gospel, and will be more 
useful in the Church in carrying on the work. 

May God bless us and help us, to appreciate our standing in the 
Church, and the privileges and the opportunities that come to us as 
Latter-day Saints, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HEBER Q. HALE 

(President of the Boise Stake of Zion) 

The deliberations and instructions of this conference have been 
to me a wonderful source of inspiration, and I am very glad to say 
that under the spirit that has prevailed I am perfectly able, without 
any reservation whatever, to harmonize all my feelings, all my opinions, 
and all my beliefs, on all questions that have been presented and dis- 
cussed, with the instructions that have been given. In the^ thrilling 
appeals made by oiy President, and others of the brethren who have 
spoken, my mind has repeatedly gone to a certain scripture found in 
the word of the Lord to the prophet Brigham Young, contained in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, Section 136:27: 

Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest 
be a wise steward; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou 
a; I his steward. 

To my mind, the crying need of the age is for us to do the very 
best we can with what we have. No one has a gift, a talent, or a 
possession, so humble, so insignificant, so unimportant, but what that 
gift, that talent, that possession, can be made serviceable to the human 
family, and become a blessing and a help to the one who possesses it. 
All that we are and all that we have, are the free gifts of God. So by 
the grace of God we are made his stewards, and given the direction of 
the affairs of our 'bodies, as a steward is given the management of an 
estate. And it is given us to say, mainly, what our eyes shall see, to 
control to a large extent what our ears shall hear, what our tongues 
shall speak, what our hands shall do, where our feet shall lead us, and 
what shall be stored in the brain. I sometimes wonder how we, as the 
stewards of God, are conducting these precious and sacred affairs that 
have been committed into our hands. Are we doing the very best we 
can with what we have, or are we burying our talents, losing sight of 
our gifts and our blessings, and wishing for things that we do not 
possess, and cannot get? When the Master calls upon us to give an 
accounting, can he say to us : "Well done, thou good, and faithful 
servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee 
ruler over many things ; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" ? Or will 
he say: "Thou wicked and slothful servant. . . . Take, therefore, 
the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents"? How 
many of us, stewards, make the Master welcome when he calls by the 
presence of his Spirit through the medium of the Holy Ghost, the 
express representative of Jesus Christ, the Son? How many of us 
invite him into our home? How many of us make him welcome in all 
the house ? Or do we assign him to what we commonly call the "spare 
room" or the "guest chamber," where no friend or brother would like 
to be consigned ? Why not invite him into the kitchen or into the 
living room, where the wife and the children are, by the hearth or the 



ELDER HEBER Q. HALE. 



171 



fireplace? There is where he loves to come. There is where he loves 
to be, and there is where we need him most. Oh, we need the divine, 
sweet, all-inspiring influence of the Holy Ghost in all the house of our 
souls, in every room, every day, and in all our affairs. Let us remember 
that he is a guest, he comes only when invited, and stays only so 
long as he is made welcome; and when we re-claim for ourselves any 
appetite, any passion, any desire, he will vacate and give us possession. 
Such is the mission of the Holy Ghost, that great Spirit emanating as a 
personage of the Godhead, the third personage of the Holy Trinity, 
to lead, to guide, to inspire into all truth, and no one can be led into 
all truth without him. 

There is something peculiarly significant in the history of the 
Jewish people. For something like four thousand years they had 
looked forward to the coming of the Savior of the world, and when 
he came, the first thing we read of him is, there was no room for him in 
the inn at Bethlehem. And I am led, sometimes, to wonder if there 
would be room for him if he came today. I wonder if he could find a 
place where he would be made welcome. What nation would receive 
him as its king? What church would resign to him? What pastor 
would step down from the pulpit and say, "Take my place ; I have 
only been serving pending the time of your coming?" I fear that the 
world is not quite prepared yet for the coming of the Son of Man to 
rule and reign as "King of kings and Lord of lords." I would rather 
pray, it seems to me as I feel now, that his coming might be delayed, at 
least until we could purify our hearts, set our own houses in order, 
and carry forward unt6 the nations of the earth the sacred mission 
that has been committed unto us, that more souls may be saved and 
fewer souls lost before the coming of that "great and dreadful day of 
the Lord." 

We have heard at this conference that there is too much policy 
among men, and let me add, among churches and among nations, and 
also say there is too much politics among men and among churches 
and among nations. We need more of the real and less of the coun- 
terfeit. We need men and women — the world need's them — who will 
arise and stand for what they know to be right at all times and under 
all circumstances. We find too often that love is counterfeited by lust ; 
prudishness is made to pass for virtue; cleverness for wisdom,- apathy 
for peace, self-congratulation for gratitude. The world needs to be 
humbled with the thought that all that we have and are we owe in an 
unpayable debt to God who gave us life. We need among us, 
even ourselves as Latter-day Saints, more gratitude and larger love, 
more sympathy for each other and for all human kind. And I fear that 
other calamities, I fear that other punishments, will come upon the 
earth ; that the Lord will have to speak through the sterner forces_ of 
nature, which seem to be his only means in many instances of arousing 
the feelings and the thoughts and appreciations of people to the condi- 
tion in which they stand, having closed their ears to the spoken word, 
their eyes and hearts to the written word of God. We need to stand 



172 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

for honesty for honesty's sake, and forever put into the discard that 
most misleading aphorism, "Honesty is the best policy." Let no man 
be honest for policy's sake. Let him be honest for honesty's sake. Let 
him be virtuous for the sake and love of virtue. Let him pay his tithing 
not for the hope of reward, but because he loves to contribute his share, 
out of appreciation of all that he has received, for the onward progress 
and assistance of God's work in the earth. We need to be honest with 
ourselves, honest with each other. 

A minister once announced to his congregation that he would, on 
the following Sunday, speak on the subject of "Liars," and directed 
his congregation to read the seventeenth chapter of Mark. The next 
Sunday he reminded the congregation of his subject, and asked how 
many had read the text in the seventeenth chapter of Mark. About 
two hundred and fifty hands went up. He said, "Just hold your hands 
right there for a moment ; you are the very people that I want to talk 
to today ; there is no seventeenth chapter of Mark." 

As stewards of God we must be truly appreciative of the things 
we receive. One has said that, "Ingratitude is a crime more despicable 
than revenge which is only returning evil for evil, while ingratitude 
returns evil for good." You remember that of the ten lepers healed 
by Christ, only one returned to give thanks. A beautiful legend tells 
the story of two angels that were sent forth throughout the land, each 
given a basket, one to gather up requests and the other thanksgivings. 
The angel of requests came back with her basket running over full. 
The angel of thanksgivings came back with her basket practically 
.empty. So it is in life. It seems that all have requests to make, but 
few of us think to return and give thanks. 

I wonder if we sometimes stop to think of our debt of gratitude 
unto, for instance, our parents ; what we owe them, and how we might 
discharge our obligation unto them. In what kind of coin would you 
pay father and mother for what they have done for you, brother, sister? 
What do you owe for the Bible ? For the sermon on the mount, as only 
one inspirational chapter in that Bible? What is your debt of gratitude 
for the Book of Mormon? For the Doctrine and Covenants? For the 
Pearl of Great Price? What do you owe the pioneers of this western 
country ? What do you owe the prophet Joseph Smith ? What do you 
owe the inventors, the discoverers, the statesmen, the poets, the 
philosophers ? What do you owe for all the modern conveniences and 
blessings of the commercial and the industrial world ? And how are you 
going to begin to discharge these obligations, my brother, my sister? 
The only way we can discharge our obligations to our parents is to live 
our lives, as sons and daughters, so as to bring credit to the name we 
bear and make our parents feel, before they die, to thank God that that 
mother had the privilege of giving birth to that son, and not regret 
one hour of vigil spent over his cradle, not regret one tear she has ever 
shed for him,, or one hour of labor spent for him; and then for us to 
go on and fulfil our missions in life and become parents ourselves. Then 
we can begin to pay the debt we owe father and mother. The only 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 173 

way we can begin to discharge our obligations to the world for all that 
we have received is to so live that we can make the world better for our 
having been in it ; that every citizen of our acquaintance can point to us 
with pride as his neighbor ; to take upon our shoulders a share of the 
world's work and be of actual service to our f ellowmen ; to be clean 
in body and soul, and see to it that our feet shall never lead into 
places where we would not want our children to follow. 

General Pershing, standing before the assembled houses of Con- 
gress on the 18th of last month, upon his triumphant return from 
France, said, among other things, in giving his report: "The burdens 
that fell to the lot of our soldiers have been heavy, and the way beset 
by many obstacles, but faith in the righteousness of our cause and trust 
in Almighty God have given us courage and inspiration." So I say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, our burdens may be heavy and our way 
may be beset by many obstacles, yet faith in the righteousness of our 
cause, which is the greatest cause under heaven, and trust in Almighty 
God, who is our Father and our Defender, will give us courage and 
inspiration, and we, like our great general, will come out victorious in 
the end, and God will look upon our labors well pleased. 

God bless us with courage and faith and love and sympathy and 
gratitude, that we may be wise stewards and do the very best we can 
with what we have, I pray in the name of him whose servants we are 
and in whose vineyard we labor. Amen.

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

This morning at 8 :30 o'clock, a meeting was held in the upper 
room of the Bishop's building, on this block, by representatives of the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations of the Church. No 
program had been arranged ; it was an informal meeting, and as it 
progressed I thought of this scripture, which I will read, from Joel : 

THE SPIRIT OF TESTIMONY. 

And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon 
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men 
shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: 

And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will 
I pour out my Spirit. 

The meeting was given to the congregation, and men were asked 
to give expression to their faith, and to make any suggestion they 
might feel like making regarding the important work in which this 
auxiliary pssociation of the Church is engaged. They stood upon their 
feet, frequently two or three at the same time. There were men there 
from Canada, from Idaho, from northern Utah, men from Arizona 
and from Mexico. There were tall men and short men ; some of them 
were light complexioned, some dark complexioned ; some were older 



174 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men, others quite young men. There was great diversity of character 
written in their faces and exemplified in their words, but there was this 
one thing which characterized the remarks made by every person who 
spoke. They all had the same testimony, it made no matter where 
they lived. They all bore witness to the divinity of this great latter- 
day work. They all bore witness to the fact that the Lord himself, 
our Father, who is in heaven, had made good this promise which I 
have read here from Joel, although none of them referred to it, that 
in the latter days he would pour out his Spirit upon the people, that 
the influence of the Holy Ghost, referred' to by Brother Hale, would be 
among men again; and, not only men but women, would enjoy it. It 
was a veritable time of refreshing to sit there and listen to the testi- 
monies of these people. Men, some of them, who had gone away from 
the Church in their youth ; they had been careless, indifferent, had gone 
off into mining camps ; their lives had not been the lives that Latter- 
day Saints should lead, but when they had turned to the Lord and 
sought him in faith, he had never failed to respond to their petition. 
And now they had been born to newness of life, they knew the truth, 
they were enlisted in God's cause, and their lives devoted to his work. 
It was a witness to me, my brethren and sisters, of the fulfilment of 
the words of the Redeemer himself. 

You know that men sought Jesus. They desired' to know the way 
by which they might attain to everlasting life. They offered money 
on occasions. But he told them that the gifts of God could not be 
purchased with money, and bore witness that except a man be born 
again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus marveled at that. 
He did not understand what it meant. Then the Redeemer illustrated 
the thought by saying, "Except a man be born of water and of the 
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." How often in the 
Church we encounter people who lack faith ! People addressed us at 
that meeting this morning who, I knew, because of their accent and 
peculiarity of speech, were not American born. I knew they had come 
from abroad. I knew the gospel had found them away over there in 
England, possibly in Ireland, possibly in Scotland, or in Wales, or in 
Scandinavia, or other of those old world countries. Their testimony 
was the very same as 'the testimony of boys whom I knew, and who 
were there this morning, whose grandfathers were in the Church, 
who were among those who first carried the gospel into the old world. 
There is no difference of nationality ; there is no difference of sex. It 
doesn't matter where we live, doesn't matter, as I remarked, whether 
we are tall or short or blonde or brunette, if we go to the Lord he will 
make good the promise which he has made to the people of the world, 
that "He who seeketh me in faith shall find me, he who asketh in 
faith believing, I will answer; to him who knocketh, I will open;" and 
just as certain, my brethren and sisters, as the Lord has made good 
♦hot nromise. so is it certain that he who does not seek does not find, 
l-."m who ('oes not knock it is not opened, and to him who has no 
desire to know the truth, truth is a sealed' book.

A REBIRTH NECESSARY — A CONVERSION TO THE <,OSPEL. 

I have often thought, and I have thought of it recently more than 
at any other period in my life, that there is, it seems to me, among 
young men and women in the Church, a spirit of indifference. This is 
not general, but there are too many exceptions to the general rule. 
We find among these boys and girls a lack of faith, a lack of knowl- 
edge ; among many of them apparently there is a sincere desire to know, 
and yet they appear to be in doubt ; I wonder if we have not thought, we 
fathers and mothers, that from the fact that our children were born in 
the Church, born under the covenant, and that we have, in the Church, 
auxiliary associations that are designed to teach faith, — whether we 
have not left our children entirely to the direction, or to a great extent 
to the direction, of these facts and organizations, and we have neglected 
to impress upon their minds that boys and girls born in the Church of 
gocdly parents must be born again to know Christ and God, just as a 
person who has been born in the world must. It isn't sufficient that our 
parents had faith. We cannot live and survive upon the faith of others. 
These boys and girls here, who are in this choir in attendance upon 
this school, good boys and girls, never can know the truths of the 
gospel to satisfy their souls unless they go to the Lord for it; and I 
promise them, as I promise all men and women, that the prayer of 
faith will bring response, comfort will come to our hearts and our souls, 
and that invisible but nevertheless potent power which bears witness of 
the truth will satisfy us so that we cannot be in doubt, and once we are 
thus converted to the truth, the whole work practically is, accom- 
plished. We are worried to know what means we may adopt to pro- 
tect our children from, the sins of the world, from the great wave of 
immorality that is sweeping over the country today as it has never 
swept over it before. We may study devices, we may discuss ways and 
means, but we will never find an effective way to combat it, except 
through conversion to the truth of the gospel, to get our hearts in 
communion with God our Father, to become possessors of his Spirit, 
for the Spirit of the Lord will protect us from the sins of the world. 
I do not believe that a boy or girl who has in sincerity prayed to God 
when he or she arose in the morning, or when he or she retired to 
bed at night, has ever transgressed the laws of the Lord upon that day. 
He will protect them. But when we forget him, we are left without that 
necessary guidance and protection. So I appeal to you to exercise faith. 
Parents, inspire in the hearts of your children a desire to establish closer 
relationship with the Lord. 

CONVINCING TESTIMONY OF A CONVERSION. 

This homely story may illustrate my thought as well as anything 
I could tell. When I was a boy, I had close friends, as all boys have, 
neighbors with whom I was chummy, and among them was a boy about 
my own age. We lived near together ; we went to school together. This 



176 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



boy had two older brothers. His parents were devoted Latter-day 
Saints. The country at that time was wild and lawless along the 
frontier. Those older brothers became freighters ; they loved horses 
and mules, and they delighted in putting together splendid teams, and 
drove those teams into Montana, and west into Nevada, and down to 
the coast in' California, freighting back merchandise which in those 
days was needed for the use of the people. They became two of the 
most profane men I ever, knew, indifferent to the faith of their fathers, 
and intemperate. One day the body of the elder of those two boys was 
brought into our town, and his funeral services were held there. He 
had been killed in a difficulty with another man. The other, the next ol- 
der, brother drifted away, and I lost sight of him. But this boy, who 
was my chum,T grew up with, and pretty soon he obtained a team and 
he went off to Silver Reef to freight, and learned to swear, and he was 
following the very road that his older brothers had followed. About 
that time I lost track of him. I went to Mexico. I came back after 
fifteen or twenty years, and had occasion to go up into Idaho to visit 
one of the stakes of the Church. I found this man there, presiding as 
bishop of one of the wards ! I found one of his sons the bishop of 
another ward. I found another son president of the Mutual Improve- 
ment Association ; and one or two of the boys had been on missions. 
He had a splendid home there, presided over in dignity by his good 
wife. 

I looked at it all with wonder, and he smiled and said, "I know 
what you are thinking about." 

I said, "Tell me how it all happened." 

"Well," he said, "you know that I was going just the way my 
brothers went." 

"Yes," I said, "that is what surprises me." 

"My parents had always taught me a better way," he said ; "they 
had urged me to read the scriptures, and finally I decided that I would 
read the Book of Mormon, and I did while I was freighting. I read it 
through, and when I came to certain words in the last chapter of 
Moroni, I was very deeply impressed with them." These are the words 
to which he referred: 

And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way 
of exhortation unto you. 

Behold I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it 
he wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how 
merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of 
Adam, even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and 
ponder it in your hearts. 

And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye 
would ask God, the eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things 
are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having 
faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the 
Holy Ghost. 

He said, "When I read those words, I thought I would put the 
Lord to the test, and I stopped' my team, wrapped the Titles around the 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 177 



brake, and got down from that high seat, on one of those old-fashioned 
California wagons that were common in early days, and I turned off 
from the road; and, you remember that piece of straight road," he 
said, "just below the twist?" 

"Yes," I said, "I remember every rock there is on it, because I 
have freighted over it." 

"Well, I went out there," he said, "under those high cliffs to the 
east of the road, went around behind some rocks where no one could 
see me, kneeled down there, and thought I would pray, and I couldn't 
say a word." 

Have any of you boys and girls ever tried to pray for the first 
time and found it difficult to say a word? There is always someone 
right there near you telling you you cannot pray, and it would not do 
any good if you did. That is one of the devices of the enemy of truth 
to prevent you from placing yourself in harmony with the Lord. 

"But," he said, "by making a great effort I managed to appeal 
to the Lord, told him that I wanted to know the truth, and I want to 
tell you that those fellows on the day of Pentecost never received a 
stronger testimony than I did; I felt that I was surrounded by con- 
suming fire, and I got up on my feet knowing just as well that the 
Lord lived, that Christ was the Redeemer of the world, that the gospel 
had been restored through the prophet Joseph Smith, and that the 
Book of Mormon is a divine record, as I knew that I was there ; and I 
got on to my wagon, drove home, left the road and came up here, 
located on this quarter section of land, and you can see the rest." 

PRAYER IS THE ROAD TO CONVERSION. 

Shortly after that, I was back at my old home, and met another 
friend of mine, with whom I had been more familiar than with the 
other. He was an entirely different kind of boy. There was nothing 
wild nor rough in his character. His father and mother were very 
refined people. We grew up together. As we got older, our interests 
became identical. We traveled together, we rode the range together; 
we went out for days and sometimes weeks together, sleeping under 
the same blankets. All this time my faith was developing, I was read- 
ing the scriptures, I was praying to the Lord, and I was full of desire 
to convert this boy companion of mine; but for some reason I never 
could make any impression upon him. 

So in after years, when I went back there and found him, his hair 
whiter than mine, I talked with him. I called him by name. I said, 
"We are getting old, we ought to be doing something, we ought to be 
thinking of the future." He had never married. A more industrious 
man I never knew. I never heard him speak an improper word. But 
he had never married. I said, "For my sake, if not for your own, I 
want to urge that you study the word of the Lord ; read the Book of 
Mormon." 



178 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Why," he said, "I have just finished reading it, and the Doctrine 
and Covenants, too." 

I said, "What did you find in them?" 

"Why, I found lots of good things, and nothing that was bad." 
"Did it impress you particularly, did it change your religious view, 
did it add to your faith?" 
"No, not specially." 

I said, "Did you ask the Lord to help you, as you read those books, 
to make you understand them, comprehend their meaning and their im- 
portance to you?" 

He looked up at me and said, "Toney, I never prayed a word in my 
life." 

I knew then why he lacked faith; I knew then why testimony of 
the truth never came to him, and I knew that it mattered not how long 
he lived, unless he went to the Lord, pleading with him for grace to 
understand, that he never would comprehend his word and will as he 
might otherwise have done. 

Now that is the secret of it, my brethren and sisters. That is what 
I want to say to these boys and girls here. If you are in trouble, go to 
the Lord ; if you are tempted, go to him ; if you have, in an unguarded 
moment, done that which is wrong, go to the Lord. He will forgive 
and pardon transgression and sin, no matter though it may have been 
grave. No persons are so far lost, except they may have committed the 
unpardonable sin, and that would be exceedingly rare, that God's arms 
are not stretched out to them for their redemption. Our transgressions 
will be blotted out from the book of his remembrance, our sins will 
be washed white as wool, through faith in him, and our hearts will 
be filled with joy, and confidence in ourselves, in each other, and in 
our Father, through the exercise of faith. 

LET US DO OUR PART IN HUMILITY AND FAITH. 

Now may the Lord bless us all, my brethren and sisters, and help 
us at this time, when his help is so greatly needed, needed as it never 
before has been needed in the history of the Church and in the history 
of the world, for we have never before been confronted by such prob- 
lems, never before has the world, has civilization, been in greater dan- 
ger, never before has so much depended upon you and upon me for the 
redemption of the world and the maintenance of the doctrines of the 
gospel in it. May the Lord help us to do our part, each of us, in humil- 
ity before him, I humbly pray. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

There have been many features of this most excellent conference 
that have delighted my soul. I have rejoiced with you in the won- 
derful testimonies that have been given, and in the divine instructions 
that have fallen from the lips of those who have addressed us.

YOUNG PEOPLE PRESENT A FEATURE OF THIS GREAT CONFERENCE 

But I want to tell you this afternoon that among the most pleas- 
ing features of this entire conference, to me one of the most gratify- 
ing, is the attendance at this overflow meeting of so many young men 
and young women. There are present here not only the boys and 
girls from the school, who have come here in response to the call of 
duty (I am not so sure but some of you would not have been here, 
if it had not been for the choir ; I am not unmindful of that fa.ct, but 
you are here in response to the. call of duty), but also groups of young- 
people throughout this audience, by dozens and by scores. At first 
thought that does not seem very much, but to me it is most significant. 
With the Tabernacle and the Assembly Hall crowded to overflowing 
it is an easy matter for young people to have an excuse to walk around 
the grounds and to take a stroll through the streets. There is but 
one conclusion — that there is in the hearts of these young people a 
desire to do what is right, and I find that is pretty generally manifest 
throughout this Church. I rejoice in it ; I rejoice in it. I will tell 
you that I never feel more inspired, more encouraged, than when I 
arise before an audience of Latter-day Saints and find sprinkled in 
that audience the clear eyes and the rosy cheeks of youth; no bleary 
eyes, no sallow complexions, no defiled teeth; souls that are just as 
clean and pure as when the spirit came from God. I am not unmind- 
ful of the fact that there are those who have soiled themselves, but, 
generally speaking, I have faith in the youth of Israel, and I love to 
see the least manifestation among them of the desire to maintain the 
standards of their parents and to uphold the standards of righteous- 
ness. 

THE BEST LEGACY TO VOUTH. 

Oh, I think nothing in this world can give such consol- 
ation, such peace, to fathers and mothers, as to realize the fact that 
their boys and girls have faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I may 
never be able, I think I can say I shall never be able, to leave to my 
children, wealth. Many of you may be unable to offer to your young 
sons, your young daughters, as they leave their household and strike 
out for themselves, even a dollar to help them on their way ; but I 
would rather live in poverty all the days of my life, I would rather 
be unable to give one copper cent to my boys and girls when they 
start out in life, but be able, through sacrifice, diligent attention, 
watchful care, to implant in their hearts a belief, a faith, in the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, than to be able to give them all the wealth and honor 
and distinction which the powers of man may bestow. I know that a 
testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the most sacred, the most 
precious, gift in our lives ; I know it. And, boys and girls, you can- 
not get that by following the paths of the world ; you cannot get it. 
You cannot get pleasure, even! Oh, you may get pleasure; I will 



180 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



take that word back; I have used it rather carelessly. You can get 
momentary pleasure by following the paths and the enticements of 
the world: 

But pleasures are like poppies spread: 
You seize the fiow'r, its bloom is shed; 
Or like the snow falls in the river, 
A moment white — then melts forever; 
Or like the borealis rays, 
That flit ere you can point their place; 
Or like the rainbow's lovely form 
Evanishing amid the storm." 

A better definition of pleasure than this from Burns you cannot 
find in all literature. You may get that transitory pleasure, yes, but you 
cannot find joy, you cannot find happiness. Happiness is found only 
along that well beaten track, narrow as it is, though straight, which leads 
to life eternal. That is my testimony to you. Sometimes there are 
obstacles, there is persecution, there is self-denial ; there will be tears, 
because you are coming constantly in contact with these enticements, 
with these worldly ideals, and you have to overcome them, and for 
the moment there will seem to be sacrifice, but it is only temporary. 
The Lord never forsakes those who seek him. I add my testimony 
to that which has been given. Never. It may not come just the way 
you think, but it will come. The Lord will certainly fulfil his promise 
to you. 

A PERSONAL TESTIMONY ON PRAYER. 

Illustrative of this, I am constrained to add my personal testi- 
mony. I seldom speak of manifestations that have come to me. I 
do not know whether it is the Scotch reticence or what, but I do not 
like to speak of some things which are most sacred to me. I am glad 
to say that I have had many, which I treasure -as most sacred ; but 
along this line, mentioned by Brother Ivins, of faith and prayer, and 
subject of prayer and the assurance of answer to prayer, I am going 
to accede to the promptings and give you a personal testimony. I 
listened as a boy to just such admonition and testimony as we have 
heard from our brethren this afternoon regarding the principles of 
the gospel, the power of the Priesthood, the divinity of this work. I 
heard the admonition that we, too, might get that testimony if we 
would pray, but somehow I got an idea in youth that we could not 
get a testimony unless we had some manifestation. I read of the 
first vision of the prophet Joseph Smith, and I knew that he knew 
what he had received was of God ; I heard of elders who had heard 
voices ; I heard my father's testimony of a voice that had' come to 
him, and somehow I received the impression that that was the source 
of all testimony. I realized in youth that the most precious thing 
that a man could obtain in this life was a testimony of the divinity of 
this work. I hungered for it; I felt that if I could get that, all else 



ELDER DAVID 0. MCKAY. 



181 



would indeed seem insignificant. And so 1 did not neglect my prayers. 
I never felt that my prayer at night would bring that testimony ; that 
was more of a prayer for protection, as I look back upon it now, to 
keep the burglars and other intruders away — really it was more of a 
selfish prayer — but I always felt that the secret prayer, whether in 
the room or out in the grove or on the hills, would be the place where 
that testimony would come. So, accordingly, I have knelt more than 
once by the service-berry bush, as my saddle-horse stood by the side. 
I remember riding over the hills one afternoon, thinking of these 
things, and concluded there in the silence of the hills was the best 
place to get that testimony. I stopped my horse, threw the reins 
over his head, and withdrew just a few steps and knelt by the side 
of a tree. The air was clear and pure, the sunshine delightful ; the 
verdure of the wild trees and grass and the flowers scented the air; 
as I recall the incident all the surroundings come to me anew. I 
knelt down and with all the fervor of my heart poured out my soul 
to God, and asked him for a testimony of this gospel. I had in mind 
that there would be some manifestation, that I should receive some 
transformation that would leave me absolutely without doubt. I got 
up, mounted my horse, and as ,he started over the trail I remember 
rather introspectively searching myself, and involuntarily shaking my 
head, said to myself, "No, sir, there is no change ; I am just the same 
boy I was before I knelt down." The anticipated manifestation had 
not come. Nor was that the only occasion. However, it did come, 
but not in the way I had anticipated. Even the manifestation of 
Gcd's power and the presence of his angels came, but when it did 
come it was simply a confirmation ; it was not the testimony. 

OBEDIENCE TO GOD'S WILL INCREASES ANSWER TO PRAYER. 

I remember on one occasion when I was seven thousand miles 
from here, when President James McMurrin was attending a con- 
fp-ence in Scotland, that in a priesthood meeting the power of God 
was so manifest that one man present in that little room jumped to 
his feet and said, "Brethren, there are angels in this room," and 
strong men began to weep, not for fear, not for sorrow, but out of the 
fulness of their souls, which left them a testimony of the truth of 
that statement. The man's declaration did not impress me very much ; 
but the Spirit present did impress me ; but when President McMurrin, a 
brother to Joseph, arose and said, "Yes, there are angels in this room, 
and one of them is the guardian angel of that young man sitting 
there" — and he pointed to a young Elder whom I knew and who was 
in our conference — he was weeping as though his soul would overflow, 
"and," continued President McMurrin, "the other is the guardian angel 
of that young man there," and pointed to a boy with whom I had 
been associated and with whom I have been since. I knew by inspira- 
tion that what President McMurrin said was true. Why there was 
not one in the room who did not know it. And then, when he turned 



182

to me and in prophetic word pronounced my future, I knew that the 
answer to my boyish prayer had come. But the testimony that this 
work is divine had come, not through manifestation, great and glorious 
as it was, but through obedience to God's will, in harmony with 
Christ's promise, "If ye will do the will of my Father which is in 
heaven, ye shall know whether the doctrine is of God or whether 1 
speak of myself." Test it from any source you wish, and you will 
find, my dear fellow-workers, that there is not one phase of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ which will not stand that test; and as you, in your 
weakness, as you in your youth, undertake to embrace these principles 
of life everlasting, you will find it instilling upon your soul a benedic- 
tion of the Holy Spirit which will give you a testimony beyond any 
possibility of a doubt that God lives, that he is indeed our Father, 
and that this is his work established through the prophet Joseph Smith. 
That is my testimony to you. I know it. . The most precious thing 
in life. You can test it. I would rather have my sons and daughters 
feel that than to obtain any earthly emoluments, because I know then 
that they will be good citizens, I know they will be good' fathers and 
good mothers, I know they will be honest and true to eyervbody, and to 
God ; why, I know that everything which a man ought to be and 
which a woman ought to be, they will become, and they will do it 
through obedience to these divine principles. 

THE GREATEST BLESSING OF ALL. 

Boys and girls, my brethren and sisters, God bless us and guide 
us to be true, true to him and his work. That work which is com- 
monly called "Mormonism" is in very deed the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
May he give us strength to live it, not only to preach it, not only to 
bear testimony to it by voice, but in very deed to live it and bear tes- 
timony to the world thereby that we do know whereof we speak. And 
that reminds me of a little line which I think is appropriate here, 
which will perhaps crystallize this thought more effectively than my 
words. I chanced to pick it up recently. The author says : 

So, he died for his faith! That is fine — 

More than most of us do; 
But, stay, can you add to that line 

That he lived for it, too? 

In his death he bore witness at last 

As a martyr of truth. 
Did his life do the same in the past 

From the days of his youth? 

• . 

It is easy to die. Men have died 

For a wish or a whim — 
From bravado or passion or pride — 

Was it harder for him? 

But to live — every day to live out 

All the truth that he dreamt, 
While his friends met his conduct with doubt 

And the world with contempt.

Was it thus that he plodded ahead, . 

Never turning aside? 
Then we'll talk of the life that he led, 
Never mind how he died. — Ernest Crosby. 

That life, with prayer and purity, will give you the greatest 
blessing in all this world, a testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, which 
I pray we may all have, and go out from this glorious conference 
to our various wards and stakes, and disseminate and radiate from our 
very being the truths and expressions of this conference, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The General Authorities of the Church were presented by Elder 
David O. McKay and unanimously sustained, as in the Tabernacle. 

The L. D. S. High School Choir, sang: "One Sweetly Solemn 
Thought." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder John L. Henrie, President 
of the Panguitch stake of Zion. 



OUT-DOORS OVERFLOW MEETING 

An open-air meeting was held at the Bureau of Information 
building, Sunday afternoon, 2 o'clock, October 5. 

Elder Stephen L. Richards, of the Council of the Twelve, presided. 
The congregation sang: 

Redeemer of Israel, 

Our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call, 

Our shadow by day, 
And our pillar by night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all. 

We know He is coming 

To gather His sheep, 
And lead them to Zion in love; 

For why in the valley 
Of death should they weep, 
Or in the lone wilderness rove? 

How long we have wandered 

As strangers in sin, 
And cried in the desert for Thee! 

Our foes have rejoiced 

When our sorrows they've seen, 
But Israel will shortly be free. 

As children of Zion, 
Good tidings for us, 
The tokens already appear; 

Fear not, and be just, 
For the kingdom is ours; 
The hour of redemption is near.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prayer was offered by Elder Lawrence W. Richards, secretary of 
the Deseret Sunday School Union. 

The congregation sang: "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission) 

I trust, my brethren and sisters and friends, that I may enjoy the 
Spirit of the Lord, in attempting to address you upon this occasion. 
I am very happy to be here and to have the opportunity of bearing 
testimony to the things which I know to be the truth. 

The message of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to 
the children of men is one of good will. The Church extends a. friendly 
feeling toward men, and desires to encourage men and women to look 
unto the Lord in a way that will bring unto them salvation, for, as. was 
said in our service yesterday by Elder David O. McKay, there is 
no name under heaven whereby men may obtain salvation except the 
name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. It matters not what denominations 
may preach or what men may say concerning the true order of wor- 
ship, there can only be one way by which men may be saved and that 
is through a strict obedience to the principles of the gospel taught by 
Jesus Christ our Lord and which have been revealed again anew in the 
dispensation of time in which we live. 

We know that the Lord's way of communicating with men upon 
the earth, according to history and according to scripture, has always 
been by revelation, either through personal visitation or through reve- 
lation by angels, or by his voice ; by these means he has communi- 
cated with men at various times since the beginning of the world, 
whenever he has had a message to bear unto his children. And I 
bear testimony unto you that in the dispensation of time in which we 
live he has spoken again and revealed the gospel of Christ with all 
its gifts and blessings, that the children of men who inhabit this land 
and this earth in these the last years of the earth's history shall have the 
privilege of redeeming themselves through repentance if they desire, 
and I take it for granted that the majority of men and women desire 
to be saved. I take it for granted that they desire to obtain the best they 
can in life, and I feel that when the true order of worship is made 
known unto men they will come unto him and receive the blessings 
which he has promised unto them. ■ I believe that the Lord, who 
created this earth and who arranged it so beautifully, of which you and 
I are witnesses in a measure, provides a still greater measure for his 
children who are the highest of his creation, and that he does not 
leave us upon this earth to go through the world alone and to take 
chances of salvation, when in the hearts of his children there is a desire 
to serve him and to keep his commandments. 

I have never seen occasion to fall out with the Protestant churches 



ELDER S'AMUEL-O.'BENNION. 



185 



of this country, or the Catholic church, or with any of the churches, 
but, after going into the question thoroughly, I have become convinced 
beyond the question of a doubt — and to me it is a real possession — that 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the authority of 
God on this earth. There can not be found in any other church the 
authority to preach the gospel and to administer in the ordinances of it, 
to take men and women into the waters of baptism and to confer upon 
them the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, which is a witness unto 
all men that Jesus is the Christ and that this is his work. 

Paul said that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus 
accursed, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy 
Ghost, and if that was true in the days of Paul (and the world, prac- 
tically, so far as Christianity is concerned, swears by him), then it is 
true today. If it was necessary then for men, in order to obtain that 
truth, to follow the instructions he gave, it is necessary now. God or- 
dained one plan in the beginning. He has said that he is the same 
yesterday, today, and forever, and if that be true so are his principles. 
There can be no variation.. The same doctrine must be taught today 
that was taught in the days of Adam, that was taught in the days of 
Enoch; that was taught in the days of Abraham, aijd so down. If he 
-shows no turning nor shadow of change, and I am sure that he does 
not, then his doctrine applies to the children of -men in this dispensation 
as it did in the days of the Christ, and' even back unto the days of 
Adam. And this is that through repentance and faith in God, men may 
turn unto him and be redeemed of him and then go on to perfection, 
as Paul has stated, "Not laying again the foundation of repentance 
from dead works and of faith towards God, but go on to perfection," 
receiving the higher principles and ordinances of the gospel, which 
lead men into the eternal worlds from whence they came. 

These principles give men an understanding in a measure of the 
positions that they shall occupy in that future which will be according 
to their works upon the earth. I am convinced, my brethren and sis- 
ters and friends, that the condition of men and women in this world is 
according to the blessings pronounced upon them and according to their 
works in that world from which we came. We may all have, it is true, 
the same rights and the same blessings and promises, but they are all 
-predicated upon obedience, and in the future that awaits us, your life 
and mine, and that of every other son and daughter of God, will depend 
largely upon our life here in the flesh. 

It was the order of God our Father in the beginning, that there 
should be continually among us a living prophet, and there can be no 
scripture brought forth to prove that there has ever been made a 
change. God has always had a prophet to reveal unto his children his 
mind and his will from the days of Adam until now, with the excep- 
tion of the time when the people apostatized and the gospel was taken 
from the earth. When I looked upon President Heber J. Grant this 
morning*, a man that we have known all our lives (I remember him 



186 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



from the days of my childhood) ; when I heard him bearing testimony 
unto Israel gathered together, it came to me again that there was a 
prophet of God. There came into this world with Heber J. Grant 
this blessing which he received as an endowment, .according to his 
faith in the world from which he came, that he was to be born into 
the world a leader and a prophet of God, I said to myself: .Verily is 
it true that leaders are not made, but they are born. They come 
into the world born leaders, born prophets, men who have been 
trained in the royal Priesthood of our Father, and their works do 
follow them when they are given the opportunity in the flesh, and 
we see him, we hear him, and we can bear testimony unto the chil- 
dren of men that in the valleys of the mountains, in the tops of the 
everlasting hills there stands and lives a prophet of God, who is in 
direct communication with his Father and with our Father, for your 
good and for mine. Happy are we if we pay attention unto the 
things which we hear from time to time, especially those things which 
pertain unto us, individually, in our own lives. 

Thanks be to our Father that we have come upon the earth in 
a day and in a time when the gospel is here, when the prophets o r 
God are here to govern and control, and, mark you, my brethren and 
sisters and friends, whether you be of the Church or not, I want 
to say to you if you question the things that I say concerning the 
gospel of Jesus Christ and the things I have spoken, I refer you to 
the law and to the testimony. If you think men and women come 
into this world by chance and that they are given opportunities here 
without appointment you are very much mistaken, for it is not the 
order of the Son of God and is not found in the scripture in which 
we all believe more of less. Men come into this world according to 
their works, according to their faith, and according to their devo- 
tion, and we, when we leave this world, will go on and find there a 
future arranged for us according to our life in the flesh. We heard 
President Grant say this morning, and it is a principle in which we 
all believe, that he saw his father and the prophet Joseph Smith and 
that he saw them consulting together concerning his appointment. 
Is not that the scripture? We read in the scripture concerning the his- 
tory of Job that the sons of God were gathered together and Satan 
was there also. The president this morning brought to our atten- 
tion that these things do occur in this dispensation, and in our day; 
and that those who have preceded him, those who have gone from 
among our midst as bishops and as presiding officers, do live and 
that they enjoy their faculties, that they are able to hear, and to 
speak, to act, and to work according to the pattern of the Almighty 
God, that they do not lose their individual entity when they leave 
this earth, and that their life there is a continuation of their life here, 
and their powers and their usefulness are based upon their activity 
here in the flesh. I pray the Lord to bless you in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH. 



187 



ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

"God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform. 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 
And rides upon the storm." 

These words were given to us by an inspired man many years ago, 
and yet, my brethren and sisters, they are just as vital and just as much 
in force, and just as true now as they were at .the time they were given. 
It is a fact, an absolutely positive thing that you can not get away 
from, that God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform. 
And in this mysteriousness we do not need to look at things that we 
can not understand. We do not need to look for the supernatural. We 
do not need to expect some most marvelous manifestation of the 
supernatural in our behalf, in order for us to understand, but the 
mysterious way that God moves in, his wonders to perform, is the way 
of. nature, is the way of order, is the way of law, is according to the 
plan which has existed from time out of mind, and unless we are in 
tune with that, plan, with that scheme, we cannot understand things, 
and we can not know just what is happening. 

It is a strange thing that many of our members are always looking 
for something absolutely extraordinary. It is another thing that 
many of our members are here in the Church today because God has 
granted unto them some remarkable manifestation of his power, but the 
great thing is that the vast majority of the members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are in the Church today because they 
have a living, vital and' abiding faith in the power of Almighty God. 

I trust that those who are within the sound of my voice are mem- 
bers of the Church for this reason, that you have founded your faith, 
absolutely and completely on that rock that Christ named as the 
foundation of his Church. I trust that you are ordering your lives, that 
things are shaping with you, that you are in tune with our Father 
and his wonderful plan. Has it ever occurred to you that perfect 
knowledge is what the devil himself possesses? Has it ever occurred 
to you that many men, who fight against God and his kingdom, know 
beyond the question of a doubt that the Gospel is true. Has it ever 
occurred to you that, in this fighting, the one thing that is lacking in 
their make-up is that very vital thing, faith in Almighty God ? I beg of 
you to consider this question, weigh it very, very seriously. I have in 
mind a man right now, whom I met but a few weeks ago, who claims 
to have had revealed to him the Son of God himself, and yet that man 
lacks something in his make-up to hold him fast to the Church and to 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Something has come between him and the 
testimony that he had, and instead of being a helper, a supporter of , and 
a fighter for, the doctrines of Christ, and the missionaries working in 



188 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



his field he is a hindrance. He is in opposition, out of harmony, and I 
said to that man: 

"Brother, do you know that the devil himself knows absolutely 
that God lives? Do you know that Oliver Cowdery, who had most 
wonderful manifestations, so much so that he was called of God 
directly by prophecy and by revelation, and had given unto him most 
wonderful visions; do you know that that man lost the Spirit of God 
through some cause? And I tell you, my brother, right here and 
right now — and I do it in love and in kindness, and I do it with the 
desire to see you hold fast to that which you know is true — that unless 
you order your life, and unless you come in and put your shoulder to 
the wheel, right now, and support the men who are here working with 
you in this branch, the fact that you have seen Christ will not matter. 
The knowledge, the faith, will be taken from you, and you will be left, 
according to the promise in the Doctrine and Covenants, to kick 
against the pricks." 

Now, we, here, are members, I hope, every one of us, of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are all claiming 
testimonies of the gospel. We are all professing that we know it is 
true, and yet here we are living in a day and age of reservations, and 
far too many of us are taking reservations as regards to the principles 
of the everlasting gospel. I ask you, and ask you to ask yourselves, 
Do you believe in God and in his Son Jesus Christ? and you will say, 
Yes, I guess I do. I will ask you if you keep the Word of Wisdom, if 
you believe that God spoke the truth when he gave that word, and 
you will hesitate. Now, if you are reserving the rignt to accept or 
reject the principles of this gospel, you are on mighty dangerous 
ground, for when you have one thing you don't believe it is a very 
simple thing to make it two and three and four, and it becomes a 
mighty serious thing. Unless vou watch yourself, and unless you 
turn, instead of having faith in God you will be an enemy of him and 
his kingdom. That is just exactly where we are. The fact that God 
has blessed us, and given us that knowledge doesn't mean that we can 
keep it. Marvelous promises, bevond our comprehension, so deep and 
so urtfathomable in their nature that we can not comprehend them, have 
been made to us, if we will live according to his law and keep his com- 
mandments and do the things that he has commanded. 

I want to read to you just a few verses from the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and I want you to ponder over them, think about them, 
and study them, and I bee of you to make therrj a part of your lives. 
If you will do it, out of this study and this application will come the 
iov that is yours. In 1832 the Father gave to Joseph Smith and 
Sidney Rigdon, a man who fell away, this wonderful promise : 

Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice, ye inhabitants 
thereof, for the Lord is God. and beside him there is no Saviour. 

Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his 
doings none can find out; 

His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand; 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH. 



189 



From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail. 

For thus saith the Lord, I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto 
those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteous- 
ness and in truth unto the end; 

Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory; 

And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries, of 
my kingdom from days of old; and for ages to come will I make known 
unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining 
to my kingdom, 

Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to 
come will I show them, even the things of many generations;' 

And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to 
heaven: and before them the wisdom of the. wise shall perish, and the 
understanding of the prudent shall come to nought; 

For by my spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make 
known unto them the secrets of my will; yea, even those things which 
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man. 

My brethren and sisters, to me the most glorious promise that we 
can expect here as mortals* on earth is the promise that God gave in 
that revelation. I declare unto you in humility and in candor that this 
subject is so vital, so big, so all-embracing, that unless we take hold of 
it, study it, and make it part of our lives, we are losing the opportun- 
ity knocking at our door today, as it knocks at every door. How 
common it is for us to kneel down and pray to our Father in heaven for 
blessings we do not deserve. How common it is for us to say, Why, I 
have never been blessed, when we do not deserve the blessings ; and yet, 
our heavenly Father has promised, not only promised, has pledged him- 
self, that if we will do our share he will do his. Look into your own 
minds, your own hearts, your own souls, take your own lives into con- 
sideration, are we doing the things that will bring us those blessings. 

I can not expect the blessing he has promised on condition of keep- 
ing the Word of Wisdom, if I don't keep the Word of Wisdom. I 
can not expect the Lord to give me the blessing that is predicated upon 
the payment of tithes, if I don't pay tithes. I can't expect the bless- 
ing predicated upon being honest, virtuous, clean, just, honorable, 
upright and faithful, unless I perform the acts that bring forth those 
blessings. I declare to you, as a servant of the living God, that it is 
vital. In this day of skepticism we must know for ourselves abso- 
lutely whether the gospel be of God or whether it be of man ; and if we 
don't know, it is only a matter of time until we will be outside and in 
the hands of the evil one. 

My testimony is that the gospel is true. My testimony is that it is 
worth while. This morning, when I listened to President Heber J. 
Grant bear his marvelous testimony, my whole being was thrilled, and 
I s%id to myself: Can any man hearing those words not perform to 
the utmost the work which God has asked him to do? 

Brethren and sisters, do not only hear these words ; take them 
to your hearts, put them into practice, take them into your lives. Who 
will be blessed by your doing so? Not the other fellow; no, but you 
yourselves, will be blessed. God help you. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation; 

No longer as strangers on earth need we roam, 
Good tidings are sounding to us and each nation, 

And shortly the hour of redemption will come;' 
When all that was promised the Saints will be given, 
And none will molest them from morn until even, 
And earth will appear as the garden of Eden; 

And Jesus will say to all Israel, Come home. 

We'll love one another, and never dissemble, 
But cease to do evil, and ever be one; 

And when the ungodly are fearing and tremble, 

We'll watch for the day when the Savior will come: 
-When all that was promised the Saints will be given, 

And none will molest them from morn until even, 

And earth will appear as the garden of Eden, 
And Jesus will say to all Israel, Come home. 

In faith we'll rely on the arm of Jehovah 

To guide through these last days of trouble and gloom, 
And after the scourges and harvest are over, 

We'll rise with the just when the Savior doth come. 
Then all that was promised the Saints will be given, 
And they will be crowned as the angels of heaven, 
And earth will appear as the garden of Eden, 
And Christ and His people will ever be one. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

My brethren and sisters, I think that with much propriety, so 
far as houses of worship are concerned on this block, we could sing 
the good old hymn: "Give us room that we may dwell," for Zion is 
growing. There are many people who have preached a funeral ser- 
mon over "Mormonism," and sung their mournful dirges ; these peo- 
ple have gone, but "Mormonism" survives. It lives because it is 
God's work. 

The Latter-day Saints, by obeying counsel and living their re- 
ligion, can not fall into the hands of men. David said: "Let me fall 
now into the hand of the Lord, * * * but let me not fall into 
the hand of man." When a man by neglect of duty or by transgression 
wanders from the path of the gospel, he falls into the hands of men, 
into a bondage cruel and bitter. Let us fall into the hands of God. 

The splendid message so splendidly delivered by the prophet of 
God, President Heber J. Grant, reached the hearts of the people. WHy ? 
Because he spoke under the power of the Holy Ghost, and the Book 
of Mormon says that when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy 
Ghost his words go to the hearts of the children of men, and so a 
minister of the gospel is not as sounding brass or a 'tinkling cymbal, 
but he is the medium, the instrument, through whom God ministers

spiritual comfort unto the children of men. This people are led by 
wise shepherds. They are not tossed to and fro by every wind of 
doctrine, but the leaders of this Church, speaking the truth in love, 
are guiding the children of God on to their destiny, which God hath 
mapped out for the faithful. 

A great writer has said that the awakening of the conscience is 
the grandeur of the soul. If our consciences have been awakened, 
which I know that they have, if we have been renewed by the good 
spirit, by the counsel we have heard, then in the grandeur of our 
souls we will go to our homes and diffuse the spirit of life and instruc- 
tion that we have received at this great gathering. Repentance is 
divine Why? Because it is a gift from God. O God, awaken the 
conscience of the world that their souls which thou hast created may 
shine out in the grandeur of repentance. 

I have felt during this conference that the speakers have clarified 
our vision. What is a man without vision? What is a man without 
an object in life? He is like "a painted ship upon a painted ocean." 
A life, to be successful, must have directness of purpose, and one rea- 
son for the strength of this work and of this people is that God has 
blessed us with a mission, with a work. O, blessed be the man with a 
work and the people with a mission. When the Angel Moroni ap- 
peared to the prophet Joseph Smith he did not say, "you may wear 
soft clothing, God is going to give you ease," but he said : "God has a 
work for you to do," and in that work the Prophet Joseph Smith 
achieved greatness and the favor of God, and that is how we are 
becoming a great people, not by what we receive, but by what we give. 
For it is more blessed to give than to receive. Now the prophet of 
old said : Where there is no vision the people perish. I can not be- 
lieve that he meant the gentiles exclusively. I believe he meant his 
people as well as the gentiles. Have we not a vision? What is it? 
First, our divine commission to preach the gospel unto every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people. Second, the glorious second coming of 
the Son of God, before whom all wickedness shall flee, and before 
whose power evil shall be subdued. Lord Macaulay said: "It was 
before Deity embodied in a human form — walking among men, par- 
taking of their infirmities, leaning on their bosoms, weeping over 
their graves, slumbering in the manger and bleeding on the cross, that 
the pride of the philosophers and the swords of thirty legions were 
humbled in the dust." It is before this power that war is going to 
cease forever and God's will be done on earth -as it is done in heaven. 
We believe in the glorious millennial reign, in a literal resurrection of 
the dead, in the reunion of families in heaven, of the sanctification 
of this earth to be the abiding place forever of the sanctified of God. 
This is part of the vision. God help us that we may not lose this 
vision, that it may not be blurred by neglect of duty or by transgres- 
sion. The Jews perished because they had no vision. They had the 
holy scriptures which set forth the coming of the Son of God. They 
had the words of the prophets, but when Jesus came they had no vision

to perceive him, his glorious divine character, and they perished; they 
perished under means of grace until the times of refreshing shall come 
from the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, what of the mission of Joseph 
Smith ? I tell you that above the dust and blood and smoke of the hor- 
rible carnage of the world-war stand in the prophecies of Joseph 
Smith. His prophecies are written across the sky that all may read. 
A great man has said that a prophecy fulfilled is a permanent miracle,' 
and therefore we can behold a permanent miracle every day of our 
lives. Go on historic Chickamauga, see the monuments that the 
southern people have erected to commemorate the valor of the boys 
who wore the gray. Go to Gettysburg where the northern people, 
have builded monuments to symbolize and to perpetuate in the mem- 
ory of their children the bravery and valor of their fathers and broth- 
ers. Shakes_peare spoke the truth when he said: "And this our life 
exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the run- 
ning brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything." Each of the 
monuments on the great battlefields of this country preach a daily 
sermon, an hourly sermon, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 
In the Doctrine and Covenants God said to Joseph Smith: "Behold 
the world is ripening in iniquity and it must needs be that the chil- 
dren of men, are stirred up unto repentance, both the Gentiles and 
also the House of Israel." Was Joseph Smith a prophet of God? 
Did he speak the truth ? Men have been preaching the results of day- 
dreams : they have been building "castles in the air." They have as- 
serted that, with the advance of medical skill and the cultivation of 
the arts and the sciences, the world was growing better every 
day, and yet God said that it was ripening in iniquity. It took the. 
draft boards, the examining boards, to discover to a great many peo- 
ple that they had been living in a "fool's paradise." Only a few 
weeks ago one of the foremost statesmen of an empire on whose domin- 
ions the sun never sets declared that his country could accomplish 
any task assigned her if it were not for consumption and venereal 
diseases. Did God speak the truth? Down at Savannah, Georgia', 
only a short time ago, a Methodist bishop declared that the world 
was more wicked and corrupt than it was in the days of ancient Rome 
and ancient Greece. I ask again, Was Joseph Smith a prophet of God ? 
Did he speak the truth? Yes, statesmen, theologians declare that he 
did. Now, my brethren and sisters, this is our mission, to proclaim 
repentance unto the world. God is going to create a new heaven, a 
new earth, for he says: "Behold, I make all things new." I tell you 
truthfuly and in the fear of the Lord that he is working today per- 
haps a greater miracle than that of creating a new heaven or a new 
earth. We read that man is the noblest work of God and this is true. 
The young men, your sons, striplings, so to speak, are being sent out 
into the world, without much previous preparation for the ministry, 
oh, God is recreating those young men. He is making them powerful 
in testimony and in preaching his word. Samuel told Saul, that if 



ELDER STEPHENS L. RICHARDS. 



193 



he, Saul, did his duty God would give him another heart, and turn him 
into another man. God is recreating these young men, he is recreating 
you, by the principles of the gospel, by the principle of faith, repent- 
ance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Brethren and sisters, how good it is to be in the service of the 
Lord. In the Book of Mormon we read that when a man is engaged 
in the service of his fellow men, he is only engaged in the service of 
his God. Service is the crown of every good man's life. The life that 
is lived for itself is barren; it is no good. The man who lives for 
himself, shrivels up, he dies, for only by working for others can we 
hope to survive in everything that is good. The crown of President 
Grant's life is splendid service to God and his fellow men. The 
crown of the lives of the apostles and all the leaders of the Church, 
from Joseph Smith down to the present time, is the crown of service*. 
It glows with the light of heaven's approbation. It is the crown of 
the life of the Son of God. He died, he served us that we might live, 
for he descended below all things to bring our redemption from sin 
and from the grave. 

I bear testimony unto you that Jesus Christ is in truth the very 
Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, the Christ. I bear testimony 
to you that Joseph Smith was his prophet, divinely chosen, a splendid 
servant of the Lord, a man whom God loved, a being whom all the 
earth shall yet honor and revere. 

Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! 

Jesus annointed "that Prophet and Seer" — 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 

Kings shall extol him and nations revere. 

Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

My brethren and sisters, the sight that I now behold is, I think, 
one of the most inspiring and impressive that I have beheld at any 
time. The large congregation gathered here, in addition to the con- 
gregations gathered in the Tabernacle, the Assembly Hall, and Barratt 
Hall is really more significant of the growth of Zion than it is to see 
the great audience that gathers in the tabernacle. 

"what hath god wrought?" 

Zion is growing. I thought, as I behold the great multitudes fill-' 
ing this temple block, of the marvelous work that has been accom- 
plished since President Brigham Young and that party of pioneers 
gathered at the mouth of Emigration Canyon and looked' over this 



194 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



barren sage brush waste without a house, without a strip of green, 
except along the creek banks, without any indications of life, with- 
out the possibilities, seemingly, for development and the nurture and 
culture and advancement of a people. I thought, "What hath God 
wrought 1" Here today are the representatives of a half million peo- 
ple, blessed of God, wealthy — wealthy in the goods of this world, more 
wealthy in the riches of heaven, possessed of the everlasting truth, 
convinced that they do have a great aim and purpose in life, striving 
to keep the commandments of God, with whom is lodged the great 
kernel of truth which shall yet fill the whole earth. As I think and 
contemplate upon the advancement of the people of God, my testimony, 
my conviction of the truth, is strengthened and confirmed. No work that 
is not inspired by the divine will could ever have grown, could ever 
have made the marvelous accomplishments that this work has made. 

THE GOSPEL THE WHOLE TRUTH. 

How has it been done ? It has been done by the overruling hand 
of God himself. It is not man's work. Never within the Church has 
there been a man with such intellect, with such power, with such fore- 
sight as to plan the great work that has transpired here in this three- 
quarters of a century. Men and women, you are the possessors of the 
greatest heritage that God our Father can give to his people. You, 
above all people in this world, and I say it, not boastingly, not seeking 
to aggrandize ourselves, but to speak the truth, you are the only people 
on this earth who have God's whole truth. It has been my good fortune 
in the last several years to pass around in various cities of the country, 
to mingle in the assemblies of thoughtful men and women, seeking 
in one manner and another to advance the interests of humanity. Only 
a short time ago I had the privilege of being in the National Bar Asso- 
ciation, gathered at Boston. There I heard men from all over this 
country, from Canada on the north, from England across the water, 
from our insular possessions, and from other countries as well, discuss 
the great problems that confront the world. I heard them advance 
their theories for reconstruction. I heard them propose their remedies, 
but after I had heard them all, I said to myself : in humility, in recog- 
nition of God's goodness, Thank God we have the whole truth. Others 
have fragments of it. God has selected men and women all "over the 
world to help do his work. The Spirit of God is not confined to us 
alone, but here we have the whole truth. I have never heard anything 
advanced that sounds like the truth, that is good, oraiseworthy, desir- 
able for men, that is not embraced in the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

MANHOOD, WOMANHOOD, TRUE CHARACTER MOST VALUABLE. 

We have had a remarkable experience during the last four or 
five years. The earth and the people of the earth have been tested. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



195 



They have gone through the great test of war. Our own country has 
been in the conflict. We have been called upon to give the utmost of 
our resources in manhood, in womanhood, in materials, for the advance- 
ment of our interest and the interest of our allies. Above all things 
else, the thing that has been found to be of most value is manhood and 
womanhood, true character, the genuine quality that goes to make men 
and women serviceable, useful and efficient. If our government, as 
well as the other governments of the earth have discovered anything, 
they have discovered that their power, their great resources depend 
upon the men and women who make up a nation. They have discovered 
that not numbers alone count. They have found that it is the quality 
of citizenship that counts rather than the quantity of it. We discovered 
very much to our sorrow when the examinations were made, which 
have been referred to, that a very large number, not an inconsiderable 
percentage of all the young men that were examined for Uncle Sam's 
service, were found to be not fit, unclean in many cases. The country 
has discovered that that kind of manhood won't subserve the interests 
of the government. The country has discovered that the only kind 
of men that will do its work are the men and women who are fit and' 
clean. In recognition of the great principles for which our people have 
stood, since the inception of the Church, I construe the experience that 
we have had to be a confirmation, a testimony of the divinity of the 
work and of the inspiration which came to our first leaders in the es- 
tablishment of the glorious doctrines and principles which have pre- 
served us as a people, and have contributed to our growth and our ad- 
vancement. 

BOYS, DEFENDERS OF AMERICA, DEFEND YOURSELVES AGAINST SIN. 

The Word of Wisdom, that simple, plain, understandable law of the 
Church, has been referred to. Let me say to you men and women '• 
that in my judgment that simple Word of Wisdom will do more for the 
advancement of the ultimate destiny of a country than any other law 
that I know of. Men and women, boys and girls who conform their 
lives to that simple commandment of the Lord will be the kind of men 
and women, the kind of boys and girls that a country will be proud of, 
the kind that will render service in times of need. Our boys have 
gone forth to fight the country's battles, they have responded in a no- 
ble manner. They did their work. They did it well. They saved the 
country. They saved my home and yours. They saved the great, 
inestimably valuable principles of liberty and freedom and justice that 
were so dear, and are so dear, to the heart of every American, yet in 
spite of all they have done and with all the good that they have done, 
they have not altogether saved themselves. I would have them not only 
save their country, I would have them save themselves, and I believe 
that the greatest duty that we can perform for them, the manner in 
which we can best show our appreciation of their valiant service, is to 



196 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



take them by the hand, indeed, put our arms around them and say 
to them: Boys, boys, defenders of America, defend yourselves against 
the incursion of sin, against the ravages of disease, against the tempta- 
tions and snares of the devil. Keep yourselves free from the sins of 
the earth, prepare yourselves to win the victory for the whole country, 
for let me tell you the winning of the war did not of itself mean the 
winning of the victory for the great mass of humanity. That is still to 
be won and as some wise man has said it will be won by that country 
or those countries which a generation hence have produced the finest 
young men and the finest young women. And that is true. 

THE INSIDIOUS CIGARETTE EVIL. 

I observe regretfully, sorrowfully, that a great number of the 
young men who went over to fight for our country have come back ad- 
dicted to the use of tobacco. It is, in my judgment, a most unfortunate 
outcome of their experience. Many of them never used it before. Most 
of them who went from this section of the country have been taught 
that it was against their interest, that it was against the law of the 
Church, and that it would only make for their ill health, and would con- 
tribute to their downfall in life. I recognize the fact that there is 
more or less excuse for them. I recognize the fact that everywhere 
they went, every station at which they stopped, every hamlet that they 
visited, there came to them offers of tobacco in one form or another. 
Young ladies, thinking to do them kindness and to show them cour- 
tesy, presented them that everlasting cigarette, — the cigarette on every 
side. Many of them were so led to adopt this practice. Then in order 
to increase their temptation, in order to make it harder for them to 
resist, there has gone forth in this country and in other countries the 
most damnable campaign of advertising that has ever been initiated 
. or maintained in all the earth, the campaign begun by the National 
Tobacco Trust, which has for its aim and object the enslavement of 
every young man, and woman, too, with this vile and injurious practice 
of using tobacco. You cannot go down a street, you cannot look beside 
a railroad track, you cannot observe a prominent place without seeing 
great, expensive bill boards advertising, soliciting for the use of tobacco 
in the most insidious ways, appealing indeed to the very love of a son 
for his father. Have you ever seen that great bill board upon which 
are printed these words : "Ask Dad, he knows," appealing to the 
desire of the boy to imitate the example which his father, in weakness, 
may have set. What a. fearful thing ! Well, men and women, that is 
before you. What are you going to do with it? Are you going to 
let this great trust that has not one single motive in this world, other 
than to make money, corrupt the morals of your boys and girls under 
that slavish and terrible practice of using tobacco ? If you do, you will 
repent of it. The time will come when you will wish you had not. In 
behalf of the Church, in behalf of all those who stand for the uplift 



i 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



197 



and the advancement of the young, I call upon you, men and women, 
whether you are members of our Church or not, to stand against this 
fearful campaign, to stand for that which will bring your boys and 
girls up to high ideals, to nobler aspirations in life, that will make them 
fit, fit for the world's service. 

SMOKERS NOT WANTED IN BUSINESS. 

I am grateful to say that there are a great many large business 
institutions in the country that won't hire a boy who smokes a cigar- 
ette. There are a great many institutions that have recognized the 
evil of this practice to such an extent that they will not have within 
their institutions a man who uses tobacco. That will help, but un- 
fortunately there" are thousands of other institutions which do not 
seem to care one whit for the morals of the community and which have 
no purpose except to gain money. There are thousands of men and 
women in this world who would be willing to sacrifice the soul of a man 
to gain a dollar. They are the ones against whom we must fight. 

ENFORCE THE LAWS AGAINST TOBACCO. 

I want to remind you that we have upon our statute books, 
enacted by the legislature of this state, laws which make it a crime to 
sell cigarettes or tobacco in any form to boys under the age of 21 years. 
I am reminded that those same laws are upon the statutes of other 
states. I believe it to be the duty of every citizen, of every man who 
has at heart the welfare of his country, to stand for the enforcement 
of these laws. I do not believe a man is entitled to the privileges and 
the blessings and the opportunities of citizenship unless he is willing 
to take the burdens and the obligations that come with them, and one 
of the obligations that come with citizenship is to see_ that the laws are 
enforced. Therefore, I call upon my dear friends, those whom I know 
have at heart the welfare of the young, to see to it that so far as it lies 
within your power you cause these laws to be enforced. I call upon 
you to get behind the prosecuting authorities to help to sustain the 
law, and if I had my way I would boycott every store, every place of 
business in this whole land that persisted in selling cigarettes and 
tobacco in violation of the law. I would not buy a pound of butter, I 
would not buy a pound of sugar, if I could help it, from any institution 
that persisted in taking action looking to the wrecking of the life of a 
boy. 

THE PICTURE NOT OVERDRAWN. 

Now, you may think that my attitude, and the attitude of my 
brethren, are extreme. Let me tell you why we feel so serious about 
this matter, why we look upon the prospects with so much of concern. 



198 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Boys who begin to smoke cigarettes take the initial step that tends 
to lead them downward. We know that aside from the deleterious 
effect caused to their health by this noxious weed, the associations, the 
manner of living, the habits of life are of even more serious consequence 
as they are attributable in many instances to the use of tobacco. A 
boy from a good family, with high ideals, with good standards in his 
life is induced to smoke cigarettes. What is the result? He cannot 
smoke at home ; his folks will not have the smoking there. He has to 
go away from home. When he goes away from home he loses the 
influence that should surround him. He becomes estranged from his 
father and his mother. The ties that bind, the safeguards that are 
placed around him are lost, and in many, many cases he is led down 
into bad company. He comes in contact with vicious characters and 
the very things that he most needs during his dangerous period of life 
are withdrawn from him. He is left to himself and in consequence he 
loses himself. He loses the fine standards, the high ideals that he had, 
and he comes to grief. In addition to that, a young man who knows 
that it is against the law of the Church to use tobacco, when he suc- 
cumbs to that practice, cannot pray. He loses the spirit of prayer. 
He recognizes the fact that his life is not in conformity with the prin- 
ciples of the gospel. He loses respect for his leaders. He loses the 
love and the confidence of the men and women who can help him, and I 
tell you he is in a dangerous place. Do you think I overdraw the pic- 
ture? I only call upon you to consult your own experiences and your 
own observations. I ask you, have you ever known of the use of 
tobacco helping any man or any boy in this world ? I ask you, if after 
you have made careful observation you do not conclude that it is at 
the very root, at the very initiation of much of the crime, the back- 
sliding, and the falling away among our people and among all people. 

LET ALL UNITE AGAINST THE EVIL. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I trust that every man and woman 
who stands here, I trust that every one who claims membership in this 
great Church, indeed, I could hope that all who claim citizenship in 
these great states here, in these valleys of the mountains, will pledge 
themselves to stand by the law of God and the law of the land. I 
trust that every man will use his influence to see that these laws are 
enforced, and I trust that the women will add the force of their power 
as well. Not alone, of course, can we hope to accomplish the result 
that we seek for by the external pressure we can bring by force of law. 
We must do it from within. We must teach these boys that it is 
wrong. We must save them, save them for themselves, save them for 
their home and save them for the country and for the church. In 
order to do that we have got to instil in them a love and a respect for 
the principles of the gospel. We have got to teach them to have 
respect for the leaders of the Church. We have got to teach them 



> 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 199 

that they cannot criticize and condemn God's servants and continue to 
have the Spirit of God with them. We have got to teach them respect 
for law. We have got to teach them the obligations of citizenship. 
We have got to make them know that they are the principal ones 
upon whom the future of the Church, the future of the state, the future 
of the nation and the world depends. 

LET PARENTS TEACH THE GOSPEL IN THE HOME. 

Boys can realize their responsibility if it is put up to them rightly. 
I plead with my fellow parents to teach the boys and the girls the 
gospel of Jesus Christ in their homes. I plead with them to teach 
them these fundamental things that they have heard discussed here 
this afternoon, in order that they may be impressed with them, in order 
thatjhey may know God, in order that they may recognize that Jesus 
Christ is the Savior of the world and that they must conform their 
lives to his laws or they cannot hope to be successful in any way in 
this life. I pray that our Father will bless the homes of the Latter- 
day Saints. I pray that every man who is the head of a household may 
be a father, a real father. I pray to God that every mother into whose 
loving hands is entrusted the nurture, the culture, the development of 
these precious human souls may be a mother, not just a woman. And 
if our homes are filled' with mothers and real fathers, God will do the 
rest. Amen. 

The Authorities of the Church were presented by Elder Stephen 
L. Richards, as in the Tabernacle, and unanimously sustained. 
The congregation sang: 

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing; 

Fill our hearts with joy and peace; 
Let us each, Thy love possessing, 

Triumph in redeeming grace. 
O refresh us, 

Traveling through this wilderness. 

Thanks we give, and adoration. 

For the Gospel's joyful sound; 
May the fruits of Thy salvation 

In our hearts and lives abound. 
Ever faithful, 

To the truth may we be found. 

Benediction by Elder Benjamin Goddard.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, the Conference was called to order at 2 o'clock 
p. m., by President Heber J. Grant who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! 

The latter-day glory begins to come forth; 
The visions and blessings of old are returning, 

And angels are coming to visit the earth. 
We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven, 
Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb! 
Let glory to them in the highest be given, 

Henceforth and forever; amen and amen! 

The Lord is extending the Saints' understanding, 

Restoring their judges and all as at fiist. 
The knowledge and power of God are expanding, 

The vail o'er the earth is beginning to burst, 
We'll sing and we'll shout, etc. 

We'll call in our solemn assemblies in spirit, 
To spread forth the kingdom of heaven abroad, 

That we through our faith may begin to inherit 
The visions and blessings and glories of God. 
We'll sing and we'll shout, etc. 

We'll wash and be washed, and with oil be anointed, 

Withal not omitting the washing of feet; 
For he that receiveth his penny appointed 

Must surely be clean at the harvest of wheat. 
We'll sing and we'll shout, etc. 

Old Israel, that fled from the world for his freedom, 
Must come with the cloud and the pillar amain; 

A Moses and Aaron and Joshua lead him, 
And feed him on manna from heaven again. 
We'll sing and we'll shout, etc. 

How blessed the day when the lamb and the Hon 

Shall lie down together without any ire, 
And Ephraim be crowned with his blessing in Zion, 

As Jesus descends with His chariot of fire! 
We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven, 

Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb! 
Let glory to them in the highest be given, 

Henceforth and forever; amen, and amen!

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 201 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Elder Joseph Fielding Smith informs me that I made a mistake, 
he thinks, in announcing that his father's favorite hymn was, "Up- 
hold the Right." He believes his father's favorite hymn was, "I 
know that my Redeemer lives." As I read the other favorite, hymn, 
I will read this one. 

I know that my Redeemer lives; 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives! 
He lives, He lives, who once was dead, 
He lives, my ever-living head. 

He lives to bless me with his love, 
Ht lives to plead for me above, 
He lives, my hungry soul to feed, 
He lives to bless in time of need. 

He lives to grant me rich supply, 
He lives to guide me with His eye, 
He lives to comfort me when faint, 
He lives to hear my soul's complaint. 

He lives to silence all my fears, 

He lives to wipe away my tears, 

He lives to calm my troubled heart, 

He lives, all blessings to impart, 

- He lives, my kind, wise, heavenly friend, 
He lives and loves me to the end, 
He lives, and while he lives I'll sing, 
He lives, my Prophet, Priest and King. 

He lives, and grants me daily breath, 
He lives, and I shall conquer death, 
He lives, my mansion to prepare, 
He lives to bring me safely there. 

He lives, all glory to His name! 
He lives, my Savior, still the same; 
O, the sweet joy this sentence gives, 
"I know that my Redeemer lives!" 

You will note that I have changed one word in the second line 
of the last verse. I remember that whenever we sang this hymn 
in the Temple, President Smith insisted on reading that line as I have 
given it, "He lives, my Savior, still the same." I believe that I am 
safe in saying that no man who has ever stood' at the head of the 
Church, within the recollection of us who were born in this valley, 
ever thrilled the hearts of the people in testifying that his Redeemer 
lived, as did our late beloved President Joseph F. Smith.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The choir sang: "Hear Him," from the Oratorio, "The Restora- 
tion," by B. Cecil Gates, solo by Emma Lucy Gates. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

That is very beautiful, indeed, and it seems very appropriate, in 
this magnificent structure, erected under the direction of President 
Brigham Young, that his grandson and his granddaughter should be 
connected with this beautiful singing. 

I sometimes feel that we should have at least four days, instead 
of three, for conference, as there are so many from whom ,we would 
like to .hear, but time will not permit. We will now hear briefly from 
the members of the First Council of Seventy. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 
(President of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I am thankful, my brethren and sisters, for the honor of stand- 
ing before you today. When I look over the vast congregation as- 
sembled here. I wonder within myself, What shall I say to you? But, 
the Lord being my helper, I shall say something, I hope, that will in- 
terest you as well as be a blessing for myself. I noticed that when it 
was announced that the music for this beautiful pieee to be rendered 
at this session had been lost and found, a ripple of merriment was 
heard, in some part of the congregation. I have always been con- 
vinced that we are a light-hearted people; that we are always ready 
to appreciate merriment, as well as subjects more profound and some- 
times sorrowful. I am reminded now of a visit I once made to one 
of our stakes of Zion. One of the brethren who accompanied us 
was among and is among the most eloquent, pleasing and forceful 
speakers; but I noticed that when he arose to speak the people be- 
gan to smile, and before he had proceeded very far with his subject 
ripples of laughter were heard throughout the congregation; and 
I was reminded of a circumstance that I witnessed in London, many 
years ago. I was at a play, during the Christmas holidays, at the 
Drury Lane theatre. A man came on to the stage ; and the mo- 
ment he came before the audience, people began to smile, and finally to 
laugh ; and when he had spoken a half dozen words, shouts of 
laughter were heard from every part of the house. I inquired of a 
neighbor", sitting near, "Who is the gentleman?" 

"That is the celebrated William Buxton, known all over the 
world as the great comedian. Whenever he appears before the peo- 
ple they laugh ; they are full of joy and merriment." 

I thought this is very well and very necessary; and yet in this 
particular congregation that I speak of in the north, I thought the 
merriment at times was a little out of place, because the brethren who 
visit those conferences, both for the Young Men's and the Young 
Ladies' Mutual, as well as for the Religion Classes, and for the gen-

eral assembly, for that matter, are handling and dealing with subjects 
that are serious, and of the utmost and greatest importance and 
moment for the consideration of all concerned. 

I rejoice today for the privilege of standing before you. I am 
reminded of some facts pertaining to the history that has brought 
to pass present events. It was remarked here today that the allied 
nations of the world, recently banded together for the defense of 
the world, were ready and glad to stand in the defense of their com- 
mon countries, and were ready for the announcement of a day which 
brought the Armistice and the cessation of bloodshed ; and I am 
glad to say at this time that I have, I believe, seen the hand of the 
Lord manifest in this great war, time after time; and no greater 
manifestation and no greater joy could fill my heart than that which 
I experienced when peace was declared. So the peace that is being es- 
tablished and considered and accentuated and furthered by the League 
of Nations has my unqualified approval because if ever I felt like 
sustaining my brethren of the Authorities — which I always have felt, 
in every fiber of my being — I have the same feeling today; and I re- 
joice in this. President Heber J. Grant is the very man to decide 
these great questions ; and I know that every true Latter-day Saint, 
I know that the Apostles and all the leading brethren who preside 
over the Church are one with him, in sustaining and upholding him 
as the true leader of this people, and we are. That makes me know, 
beyond a question of doubt, that the Latter-day Saints are on the 
right path, and on the direct line of progress and advancement. There 
have been men raised up by the hand and providence of Almighty 
God, time after time, to bring to pass the events and the great issues 
which we witness today. 

The name of Lincoln was mentioned here by one of the speak- 
ers- It is recorded that his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in their 
little cabin home, irr the wilds of old Kentucky, which was the Far 
West in that day, one morning went about her work smiling and 
singing, seemingly full of joy and rejoicing, and her husband said 
to her: 

"Nancy, what makes you so happy?" 

She said: "Thomas, last night I saw a vision; I was signalled 
from the shores of eternity, and I shall have a son. He will be a 
great man among men ; for I saw that he was among men; for I 
saw that he was among the leaders of the nation, and that among 
the great men he was great. He came to his mother, put his arms 
around me and said: Mother, I have builded for you and for my 
country a beautiful palace, with marble pillars that reach to high 
heaven ; but it has cost me my life.' " 

At the close of the war, forty days after his second inaugura- 
tion as President, a crazy assassin sneaked into the procenium box, at 
the Ford theatre, in Washington, placed a pistol behind his ear and 
lodged a bullet in his brain. He had gone through the agony of 
four years and a half of the Civil War. He had met every difficulty,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



face to face, when often members of his own party seemed in doubt, 
and many of them so far forgetting themselves that they came to 
him, with tears in their eyes, and with trembling voice, and said: 

"Lincoln, you must stop the war, even if you break the Union." 

Lincoln replied: "Never, while life is in me, will I surrender to 
those who would disrupt this glorious nation of ours;" and he main- 
tained the cause of the Union through all those years of trial. When 
he had completed his task, the Union, the beautiful "palace" that he 
had established and maintained, the glorious Union of this glorious 
country was established more firmly than ever before ; for the scourge 
of slavery was taken entirely from its institutions, and none but freemen 
occupied the soil of the United States. So he had builded the pal- 
ace with beautiful marble pillars, for his countrymen and for his loved 
ones. Sacrifice seems to have been the law of those great hearts who 
have been the ministers of the world, who have produced results 
that have saved the world from time to time. As Lincoln's mother 
said, on one occasion, when he inquired why the Indians had been 
permitted to destroy a village in which his grandfather lived, and 
to scalp his grandfather and take his life: "Boy, you must know 
that there never was a country worth having, that there never was 
a cause worth fighting for, that did not cost the best blood of those who 
defended it." Sacrifice so begun and accentuated more fully in other 
great men's lives ! 

President Grant informs me that the time is up. I testify to you 
that "Mormonism" is true; that our Leaders are directing the affairs 
of this Church, according to the mind and will of the Lord. God 
bless you. .Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brethren and sisters: If I could do so/ without being mis- 
understood, I would be very happy and more than pleased to yield 
my time to my brethren who are to follow. That, however, would 
be misconstrued; and so, responding to the wish of President Grant, 
who is conducting this conference I am sure, by the inspiration of 
the Lord that is in him, I desire to say, and am thankful for the op- 
portunity of saying it, that I believe in God the Eternal Father, as 
the creating and sustaining power of the universe. I believe in his 
Son, Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer of men. I believe in the Holy 
Ghost as the witness of the existence, and power, and majesty and 
might of the Father ; and the witness also to the redeeming power of 
the Christ. I believe that these Three constitute the one Godhead of 
our universe, and that 1 there proceeds forth from their presence the 
spirit that carries the power and attributes of God — wisdom, holiness, 
majesty, justice and mercy — throughout the immensity of space; and 
that it is possible for men to live and move and have their being in 
that holy Presence. I believe in the new dispensation of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ in these our own times; that Joseph Smith was a 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



205 



prophet inspired of God to establish — no, re-establish — his Church up- 
on the earth, no more to be thrown down, forever; and as the years 
multiply upon my head a knowledge of these great truths increase in 
their emphasis in my soul. "Time but the impression deeper makes, 
As streams their channels deeper wear." To this I bear witness in 
your presence, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 
(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I presume there are very few who are here present who are not 
aware of the fact that I was born in these valleys of the mountains. 
Have I not given evidence to the Latter-day Saints of this Church, 
during the twenty-seven years of my ministry? Have I not been frank 
and honest and clear in my statements, and have I felt any doubt in 
your minds that I do not believe and am not honest and truthful and 
believe with all my heart and with all my soul that God is the Father ? 
I may not have a perfect and true conception of God, but I love 
God ; I love him for his perfection ; I love him for his mercy ; I love 
him for his justice; and notwithstanding my many weaknesses I am 
not afraid to meet him. For I know that he will deal justly by me; 
and the great joy I will have is that he will understand me and that 
ie more than some of you have been able to do. (Laughter.) I be- 
lieve with the same love and faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Re- 
deemer of the world I believe that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, 
and there is no man living who reads the things that God has re- 
vealed through the Prophet, and the sayings of the Prophet with 
more joy and more satisfaction and more happiness than I have in read- 
ing of the Prophet of God. My father breathed it into my very soul, 
and I thank God that I am a son of one of God's servants, and that 
no man can place a finger or make a statement that he did not up- 
hold the Prophet of God, not only Joseph Smith but Brigham Young 
and all the others who labored in the Church. Now, friends, if you 
are in any doubt about my standing in the Church and any of you 
want to question my loyalty and patriotism you can get a row any time 
you want it. (Laughter) 

I sustain President Grant. When he became President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I told him I sustained 
him with my full faith and confidence ; and that is the best I can do. 
I propose to stand behind him and his counselors and the Twelve 
apostles. As I told an apostle once: "If God Almighty puts a child 
in the Council of the Twelve, and he will give me enough of his Spirit, 
I will sustain him. I pray the Lord to bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I find myself in full and happy accord with the spirit of this con- 
ference and the utterances that have been made from this stand. I 



206 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



believe in the doctrines that have been taught. I believe in those prin- 
ciples which are the underlying foundation of the work of God which 
contemplate and have for their purpose the liberation and freedom of 
the children of God, not only our civil liberty and freedom from the 
tyranny of despotic and autocratic governments, but also that per- 
fect liberty which can only be attained through obedience to the 
"perfect law of liberty" — the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — the 
truth which will make us free indeed, even free from the bondage of 
sin and the tyranny of the adversary of our souls. 

The discovery of this, land — the promised land — the Land of 
Joseph, the Zion of latter days, and' the' establishment thereon of this 
government, a government deriving its powers from the consent of 
the governed, is so interwoven with the work of God that we are 
bound to recognize the inspiration of the Almighty in connection there- 
with. 

Read I Nephi 13, 12 where Nephi sees in vision that the Spirit 
of God inspired the great Columbus (it can mean no other) to cross 
the many waters, the great Atlantic ocean, which separated him from 
the seed of Nephi's brethren, who were in the promised land. 

Let me, then, declare my faith in the inspiration of the Lord 'as 
it relates to these historical events : 

I believe that the Lord restored this land and inspired its dis- 
covery by Columbus for the purpose of establishing a government 
thereon which would secure to its people their inalienable rights of 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

I believe that he inspired Thomas Jefferson in the writing of the 
Declaration of Independence. I believe that the Constitution of the 
United States was inspired of God, that under its protection his 
Church could be established and thereby the "perfect law of liberty," 
the gospel of Jesus Christ) be promulgated not only in the promised 
land but in all lands, to every nation, kindred', tongue and people. 

I believe that George Washington was the human instrument in 
the hands of God in establishing a government based on the principles 
of human liberty. 

I believe that Abraham Lincoln was the human instrument in 
God's hand of preserving these precious principles that they should 
not perish from the earth. 

I believe that Woodrow Wilson is the human instrument, in the 
hands of the Lord of extending these principles to all the nations of 
the earth, for God is no respecter of persons but designs that all his 
children shall be made free. 

I believe that the League of Nations covenant, when ratified, 
will become the instrument whereby the inalienable rights of men shall 
be extended to our Father's children in every land, that it will be an 
effectual opening of the door which will admit the promulgation of 
the greater, the perfect, law of liberty, through which the Lord designs 
to make his children free. Amen. 

A sacred solo : "Abide with Me," was sung by David Rees. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. - 207 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I have rejoiced exceedingly, my brethren and sisters, in the 
splendid things that I have heard during this conference, and I feel 
that I have been very greatly benefited by the earnest testimonies that 
have been borne by the presiding authorities of the Church, and by 
the doctrines of the gospel of the Lord. Jesus Christ that have been 
sounded in our hearing under the inspiration of the holy Spirit. 

I have had the blessed privilege, my brethren and sisters, of 
engaging, for the past few months, in the preaching of the gospel 
in the California mission, and have witnessed, during the short time 
that I have been in this ministry, the marvelous thing that God, our 
Father in heaven, is able to do with his handmaidens and with his 
servants who engage in the preaching of the gospel. I suppose all 
those who have responsibilities resting upon them similar to the re- 
sponsibilities that rest upon me, at the present time, wonder why from 
the ranks of the holy- Priesthood there cannot be found men, with 
love in their hearts for the gospel of Jesus Christ, who have had ex- 
perience in the preaching of the gospel, to come into the missionary 
field and exercise the gifts and graces and powers that have come to 
them by experience, for the spreading of the gospel among the peo- 
ple. Yet the marvelous thing that has taken place, before my eyes, 
in the past few months has been to see boys, who have come with 
very great fear, with very great anxiety, with very much stammering 
and with trembling limbs, developing into earnest missionaries for the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and to hear them, while tears were streaming 
down their cheeks, bear testimony that the Lord God of heaven had 
revealed unto them the truth of the everlasting gospel, and to hear 
them make declaration that the work of the ministry, that seemed to 
be such a tremendous undertaking when they came into the mission 
field, had been the sweetest and the most precious and the most won- 
derful experience that had ever come into their lives. 

I rejoice to be associated with the sons and daughters of Israel 
in the preaching of the gospel of the Redeemer of the world. I am 
glad for the faith that can be found in the hearts of the young men 
and the young women who are willing to respond to the calls that 
are made upon them by proper authority, and go forth in their weak- 
ness and in their fear, and lift up their voices in proclamation of the 
truth. I rejoice, above all else, in the wonderful power of the Lord 
our God to so bless these feeble instruments that they are. able to 
maintain the truth of the gospel and to attract to the fold of the 
Master, men who in worldly learning and in the polish of the world 
may be superior to themselves. 

Thank God for the gospel ; it is, indeed, the power of God unto 
salvation. This work, to which we have given our allegiance, is not 
the result of the wisdom of men's thought; but it is, as it was de- 
clared to be, in the very beginning by Joseph Smith, the revelation 



208 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the Lord. I bear record that God our Father in heaven and his son, 
the Lord Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I bear 
record that men who had ministered in the authority of the holy 
Priesthood, while dwelling here upon the earth, as greater beings in 
their resurrected bodies appeared to Joseph Smith and ministered un- 
to him and conferred upon him the authority of the holy Priesthood 
and gave commandment that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
again should be sounded in the ears of the inhabitants of the earth. 
I bear record that that divine authority, the power to speak in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the right to call men to repentance 
and to an investigation of the glorious gospel, has been conferred 
upon the men who have been teaching us during this conference. 

I admonish Israel to hearken to the voice of the good Shepherd 
as it has been made manifest through the presiding authorities of 
the Church, to follow that voice, to follow that lead, and God will be 
your father and friend and will continue to reveal unto you the truth 
that has been made manifest in this dispensation. I bear record that 
the things that we are teaching, the principles of the gospel, those 
fundamental principles — faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance 
from sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the 
laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost — that they have 
been revealed in our day, that they are just as full of power as. they 
were in the days of the ancient Apostles, and that the gospel today, 
is, as it always has been and ever will be, the power of God unto sal- 
vation. God help us to-believe it, and be true to it, forever and for- 
ever. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

I, also, my brethren and sisters, rejoice in the testimonies which 
the brethren have given us during this conference, and in the instruc- 
tions and admonitions which have been presented. I rejoice in the 
just emphasis which the restored Church places upon principles and 
practices among men ; that God is no respecter of persons, as is indi- 
cated in the revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the fifty-sixth 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, in giving warning 
to the rich man and warning also to the poor man. 

It is a matter of continued satisfaction that we have the right 
view of education. The president of the greatest university in the 
United States, so far as numbers are concerned, has defined educa- 
tion to be the capacity of a self-conscious being to adapt himself to en- 
vironment and the power to change that environment. That environ- • 
ment he divided in two classes — the well known physical and, more 
important than that, the spiritual; — having to do with what makes 
up the so-called civilization of mankind, man's art, his science, his 
literature, his institutional life and, last but not least, his religion. So 
the president of that great university, Columbia, makes a plea for 



CHARLES H. HART. 



religious training and our Church is successfully solving that problem 
of giving religious training without impinging upon the rights of 
other religionists to have in our public schools neutrality so far as 
sectarian Christianity is concerned. 

I rejoice in the teachings of the Church that this land of ours is 
God-protected ; that it has a special mission ; that it is governed by a 
constitution formed by wise men, raised up for that purpose; and 
that the Doctrine and Covenants gives us the essentials of the Declara- 
tion of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, ex- 
pressed in these instruments, to the effect or in substance that all men 
are free and equal, and that governments derive their just powers 
from the consent of the governed. I rejoice in the further fact that 
the boys of this Church, as also the boys of this state* and of this 
Nation, have performed a noble part to perpetuate these principles in 
the world. When they went forth in foreign lands, singing: 

God is in his judgment seat, 
Christ is on his tree, 
And Pershing's men are marching — 
Marching into Picardy;" 

they had the true spirit of the Crusaders of old, who were willing to 
battle to the death to rescue the sacred sepulchre from the hands of 
the Saracens. I feel proud of the work that our boys did — the work 
of General Young and others. I have felt that it was indeed provi- 
dential that that splendid body of men, grouped as they were, were not 
required, in the providences of the Lord, to undergo a baptism of fire 
and of death in the great conflict in which they were willing to make 
the supreme sacrifice, and should have credit for their willingness as 
fully as though the deeds had been performed. These men and we 
ourselves, I feel sure, cannot realize the importance of the work 
which has been done to sustain these great principles in the world. 
The "Mormon" Battalion boys, as we familiarly call them, did not 
realize the sublime service, for this state,, and for this intermountain 
country, which they performed in 1846-7. They were not permitted 
to live long /enough to have a view of the full glory which was 
theirs; but, like Moses, were permitted only from afar to view the 
promised land. These men did not fully realize the glory which their 
posterity will receive from the works of their fathers. It is true that 
they heard their general say that history might be searched in vain 
for a like march of infantry; that they had heard' General Kearny 
say, as repeated by General Cooke, that Napoleon had crossed the 
Alps, but that these men had crossed a continent ; and after the lapse 
of all these years we begin to get a true perspective of the sublime 
work of. these soldier citizens. Purely as a civic move our legislators 
have provided for a beautiful monument for these men, by appro- 
priating $100,000, and men not of this Church have been just as 
active and some of them more active, perhaps, than Church men, in 
the securing of this great tribute. 



210 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



If time permitted I would like to read some of the remarks 
which one not of our Church has made in reference to the sublimity 
of this monument ; but there is only remaining time for me to express 
the thought that our people will do honor to themselves in contribut- 
ing to this monument, as they, will realize as they learn the real ac- 
complishment of these Battalion men; and that in the future they 
will be doing like credit and honor to themselves to rear a more 
costly monument to the memory of the boys who have been willing 
to make the supreme sacrifice for their country and for the world. 
I am sure that their labors will not be in vain; that there shall be no 
retrograde movement; that the history of international law and the 
world will not contain a chapter showing that while steady although 
slow progress was made through all the centuries of the past; that 
when we came to this enlightened Christian age, an age in which 
the restored gospel was received, that a retrograde movement set 
in, and that progress in the great branch of the law known as inter- 
national law ceased and that, there was a backward turning. I think 
that in the providences of the Lord the fruitage of the seven and a 
half millions of lives lost in the war will not fall to the ground and 
be futile, but there shall be a sublime and divine fruitage by the es- 
tablishment in all the world of these principles for which the Con- 
stitution stands, an instrument given to us by inspired men, and de- 
signed to secure immortality to the work of man, so far as immortality 
can be imparted to -human institutions. 

Now there is only sufficient time for me to drop a word of testi- 
mony. I concur in the testimonies which my brethren have so sub- 
limely and strongly given ; and in addition I testify to the great joy 
that I have had in the past thirteen and a half years by being closely 
associated, in travel and in the work of the ministry, with these men 
whom, in a few minutes, you shall uphold your hands to sustain as 
prophets, seers, and revelators. I am a witness that they have been 
warned of danger that was unforeseen by mere human wisdom ; that 
they have prophesied of unusual things which have come to pass thaf 
the sick have been raised under their administration, and that thev 
have administered the word of the Lord as meat in due season to 
the people, and the people have had a refreshing of the Spirit under 
the ministrations of these my brethren. It has been my privilege to 
travel more, I think, with President Grant than with any other one 
member of the Twelve or the First Presidency, except perhaps the 
late Hyrum M. Smith; and I have learned to love very much Presi-, 
dent Grant for his courage, for his frankness, for the simplicity and 
strength of his life, and for his faith. My first thought before I was 
acquainted with him was that he would be more sympathetic with 
the richer than with the poorer people, but I soon learned ho.w badly 
I was mistaken in reference to that. I rejoice that he has been called 
into this high position to preside over this Church, and I have the 
fullest confidence in the success of his administration. May the Lord 
bless him and his counselors and the Twelve, who have treated me 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG. 



211 



so generously, as generously as my own father could possibly treat 
me. Brother Grant has always treated me as generously as he would 
treat himself, and the other brethren, particularly the older brethren, 
and some of those who have departed, have been indeed fathers to me. 
I rejoice in my associations with them and with the Church, and I 
pray the blessings of heaven to be upon us all, in the names of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 
There are eleven thousand Seventies in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have already organized one hundred 
and ninety-eight quorums of Seventy throughout the Stakes of Zion. 
They are beginning, more and more, each day, to cooperate with all the 
other brethren holding the Priesthood of God. As one of the seven 
Presidents of Seventy, I wish to say that it is our desire that the 
Seventies of the Church become the scholars and missionaries to preach 
the gospel in all the world. We want them to have the power, the love 
and the light of God to aid them in this great work. We sincerely hope 
that the Seventies will take upon themeselves new life, new hope, new 
vigor, and prepare themselves for the ministry more than they have 
done in the past. 

This has been a remarkable conference. The many testimonies 
given ring true. I bear you my testimony that everything that has 
been said is true ; for the words, the sentences, the thoughts have been 
pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The fact that ever since 
the days of Abraham the Lord has called a portion of his family to 
bear witness of his great truths is an inspiring truth. This place in 
the mountains had been preserved for the people of God. It will al- 
ways be a Stake of Zion. May we as Latter-day Saints, from this day 
on have our testimonies renewed that the Government of the United 
States was instituted by the power of God, and the way prepared for 
the coming of the gospel of Jesus Christ. May that testimony grow 
in our hearts, together with the greater testimony that God lives, 
. and that the world needs a knowledge of the message of Jesus Christ. 
There can be no solution of our industrial, social and political prob- 
lems until the world shall know for a fact that Jesus is the Christ 
and that we are living in a new day of the world's history. May we, 
each and every one of us, return to our homes, buoyed up in our souls, 
with a courageous feeling for the new day, and the promise of a 
knowledge of God and his great work. May the love and the light of 
this glorious gospel rejuvenate our spirits as never before, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church.) 
It is less than a year since I stood with President Grant at the 
grave of our departed Prest. Joseph F. Smith. I then and there, on that 
sacred spot, made pledge and covenant with Prest. Grant that I would

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



devote myself as energetically, as fervently, as obediently, in trying 
through my weak efforts to make his administration a success as I 
■ever had done in the work that I had tried to do and had done in the 
administration of President Joseph F. Smith. I have devotedly and 
conscientiously tried to fulfil that covenant in all humility, in all obed- 
ience, and in the spirit of the office and calling which I hold. I pro- 
pose to continue in that line, and there isn't anything that these breth- 
ren can ask me to do that I will not willingly try to do for the further- 
ance of this work; and they will not ask me to do anything that is 
not in the interest of the Kingdom of God. But there is one thing 
on which President Grant and I never could agree; he thinks that 
his wife is better looking than my wife. Well, I don't believe a word 
of it. (Laughter.) Anyhow, if it is referred to a league, or assembly 
of arbitration, I would have three votes to his one. Now with that 
exception, brethren and sisters, we are in entire agreement and we 
are working together harmoniously, and, as I say, so far as I am con- 
cerned, obediently and in the spirit of the work. 

Now just a minute or two on a matter that I think is of con- 
siderable importance. We are blessed abundantly in wordly things in 
these times. Never was there such a profusion of money. Money, 
they say, is cheap, but the articles we have to buy with money are 
dear, which is true indeed. But you produce, you farmers, most of 
the articles that the rest of us have to buy and there is plenty of money 
and pretty much everybody has it. The unfortunate thing about it 
is that a great many people are spending it foolishly. I know I find 
it so, east and west, wherever I travel. You see attention called to 
it in the magazines and newspapers. People are spending, as they 
say, "like drunken sailors." We ought to pause in that. We ought 
to save while we have abundance. It is a foolish person who spends 
all he has, and who does not save. I know there are some who will 
say, "Well, if you had only what I have, and the family I have to 
keep, you would not think much about saving." That may apply and 
does apply doubtless to a few families, one here and there, but to 
the great general part of the Church, the farmers and business men - 
and artisans who are a large part of our population are making means 
in abundance and are not saving any and putting it away for a rainy 
day. We are spending it, and we are spending it extravagantly, al- 
most wastefully; and this is a sin. If instead of crowding into so 
many picture shows a week, if we would only stay home a night or 
two a week and read the Bible or the Book of Mormon or the Doc- 
trine and Covenants to our families, we would be spending our time 
in a more profitable way and also saving our money. People have 
lost the idea of being thrifty any more or very careful about their ex- 
penditures either. 

The Lord is working in the earth. The predictions of the proph- 
ets concerning this land are being fulfilled. I heard Orson Pratt 
preach a sermon in Liverpool, forty years ago last March, concern-

ing this land, and the mob law that would obtain, the destruction of 
society, or, if not its entine destruction, the destroying element that 
would be abroad in the land, the utter disregard for law and order, 
and established customs, the terror, the riot, the anarchy that would 
take place. I see it being fulfilled in our own land, right here, and it 
is coming more and more. Were it not for what there is here in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I would despair ; but 
the promise is and has been — I have heard it repeated, iterated and re- 
iterated hundreds of times — that there would be a people here who 
would stand for law and order, who would maintain it, and constitu- 
tional rights would be observed although the Constitution would be 
torn to shreds and tatters, as we see it being torn around us in these 
very days, these anxious, terrible days that are upon us ; but here it 
would be safe. This is the mission of the Latter-day Saints ; this is 
the mission of "Mormonism," to be saviors upon Mount Zion, to save 
that which is good of the earth. 

I passed through Omaha the other day, just a day after the ter- 
rible occurrences that had transpired there, where the mayor of the 
city, who was sworn to do his duty, tried manfully to do it. They 
hung him by the neck until he was pratically dead. One of the police- 
men climbed the pole and cut the rope just in time, so that he was 
resuscitated, but he was unconscious and gone so far as he was con- 
cerned. But, thank God, he is alive. This man sworn to do his duty, 
trying I believe to do his duty, and yet the spirit of anarchy and riot 
and mob rule would hang that man, and did hang him, and burned 
others, burned the jail, burned the courthouse; and, as you know, 
troops were called in. I need not dwell on it all. Well, such occur- 
rences go on, and we pass them by, seemingly, as the idle wind, and 
heed them not, but they are here. Only the other week, in Los 
Angeles, a few platform men of the street railroad could not get the 
settlement that they wanted, so they went on strike. Out of sympathy 
for them, the General Electrical Company employees down there, went 
out on what they call a sympathetic strike, and then all the railroad 
employees operating trains into the city of Los Angeles went out on 
a sympathetic strike also and tied up every industry in the city, even 
tied up hundreds of people here and at other points along the line, 
who were thus inconvenienced and punished simply because the rail- 
road employees were in sympathy with the few platform streetcar 
men in Los Angeles. A sympathetic strike is little less than anarchy. 
These railroad men and Pacific Electric men had no grievance against 
their companies, neither as to wages, hours of work, conditions of 
work or anything else; they had no grievance at all, but merely out 
of sympathy for somebody else they tied up the whole business of 
hundreds of communities and for what? For mere sentiment. This 
is one of the worst of the signs of the times. 

Now I must be brief; my time is nearly up. I want to say that 
T cannot, for one, join any association or lodge or union which di-

vides my allegiance to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
To serve the Lord acceptably, my allegiance to him must be undi- 
vided. My purpose must be single. If thine eye be single thy whole 
body shall be filled with light. Now if I am obligated by oath or 
covenant of any kind to some other organization I have of necessity 
a divided allegiance. This should not be. My allegiance to the 
Church comprises and includes everything that the civil government 
requires and a great deal more. My allegiance to the Church causes 
me not to hate my brother; my allegiance to the Church makes 
me an infinitely better citizen, as citizenship goes in the world, than 
if I were not connected with the Church. Now I must not have a 
divided allegiance. The Kingdom of God first — stand by it! 

The prediction has been, my brethren, that civilization shall not 
fail ; the Constitution of our country shall not altogether fail. It is not 
all going up in wreck, for here, and I believe here only, will peace 
and prosperity and the maintaining of the Constitution of the United 
States and the securing of the liberties of the people, transpire; here 
through the medium of this Church, and I do not see much hope 
anywhere else. God bless you ; God bless the men who stand at the 
head ; I am with them ; I am for them ; I uphold them ; I pray for 
them. As I said before, there is not anything that I will not try to 
do in the interest of this work, if they ask me to do it, and I will try 
to do a great many things they do not have to ask me to do. God 
bless us; God bless this people; the Lord help Zion and direct us in 
these terrible times that are upon us, the terribleness of which will 
increase and not decrease until Zion is established and the work of 
the Lord accomplished, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We would have been very much pleased, indeed, to have heard 
from one or two more, but time will not permit. I wish to say that 
each and all of the general authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, without any reservations whatever, have my 
unbounded love and confidence. They have sustained me with their 
faith and their prayers, and have fulfilled every request that I have 
made of them. I wish to say that there is not a stake president in 
all the Church who does not have my love and confidence. The 
Latter-day Saints throughout the Church have sustained me beyond 
anything that I could have expected or believed possible. I pray 
God to sanctify all that has been said and done in this conference to 
the good of the Latter-day Saints. I pray for the welfare of man- 
kind, at home and abroad. I bear to you my testimony that God has 
spoken again from the heavens, that we- have the gospel of life and 
salvation ; and I pray God to help us to live it, all of which I ask, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Cramer, and at the open-air meeting near the Bureau of Information

Edward H. Anderson, Clerk of Conference. 



AVE you ever stopped to think how much time 
we spend in planning what we shall put on 
and what we shall put in our children's bodies 
and how little in planning what we shall put 
in their minds? They go to school, to be sure, 
but that is for only five hours a day for approximately 185 
days a year. What of the years before they begin to go to 
school, what of the hours and days each year in which they 
are not under instruction? Have we any deliberate plans 
to care for the mind's growth as we care for the body's? 

It is just as important that children shall read good 
books as it is that they shall learn to read at all. It would 
be hard to find any one who would declare that it is un- 
necessary for children to learn to read. Yet reading in it- 
self is not the end we seek, but only a means to the end. 
The goal of all education is the enrichment of life, and a 
child's reading carefully guided will deepen and strengthen 
his future ability to make the most of himself and his op- 
portunities. 

To really love books so that they may be woven into 
the warp and woof of his life a child should have his own 
individual library, which grows year by year with his 
growth, yet which contains friends to whom he will return 
time and time again, secure in the knowledge of a happy 
companionship, full of pleasant associations. A large num- 
ber of books is not essential to have, but a few should be 
added each year and the standard of choice should be kept 
high. — Seattle Public Library Bulletin.

Read the Church Works 

Every Latter-day Saint family should possess a com- 
plete set of the Church Works. They are full of inspired 
teachings and bring an influence in the home that is whole- 
some and uplifting. Familiarity with these inspired books 
means intelligent membership and a spiritual equipment 
for big, wholesome service. 

Let your children make the acquaintance of these sa- 
cred volumes by frequent contact with them in the home. 
There is no more impressive and effective way to impress 
them with the truths of the gospel. 

The Doctrine and Covenants — A wonderful book of 
modern revelations. The word of the Lord to the people 
of this dispensation. No home library is complete with- 
out it. 

The Book of Mormon — A history unique. A gripping 
story that has the distinction of being true. A compendium 
of divine truth. 

The Pearl of Great Price — A volume of pleasant and 
profitable reading. It's all that its title implies. 

The History of the Church — By any one of three or 
four trenchant writers. A history full of romance, heroism 
and achievement. 

You need the Church Works in your home. We can 
supply you with any or all of them, in a variety of bind- 
ings, and prices to meet your convenience.

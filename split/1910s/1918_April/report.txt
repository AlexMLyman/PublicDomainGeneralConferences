GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I feel very thankful, beyond my words for expression, to have the 
privilege that I have of meeting- with you this morning, and I am de- 
lighted to see the number who are assembled here at the opening session 
of this Eighty-eighth Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Chr.st 
of Latter-day Saints. I feel to thank you for your presence here this 
morning, for to me it is an evidence of your interest in the great cause 
in which we are engaged. I feel that the spirit of the gospel, which is 
the Sp : rit of the Lord, will accompany us through the sessions of this 
conference as an evidence of the faith, good desire and faithfulness of 
those who have assembled this morning and who will continue to meet 
with us through its sessions. 

PHYSICALLY AILING, BUT SPIRITUALLY STEADFAST. 

It is an unusual thing for me to attempt to make any apology for 
myself, but I am in a condition of health just at. this time which may pre- 
vent me from taking so active a part at this session of our conference as 
I have usually taken. I hope there is nothing very serious the matter with 
me, more especially regarding my faith in the work of the Lord and my 
love for God's truth. I may have physical ailments, but it appears to me 
that my spiritual status not only remains steadfast as in times past, but is 
developing, growing, becoming more thoroughly established in the faith 
of the gospel, in the love of truth, and in a desire to devote all the energy, 
time, wisdom and ability the Lord may give to me to advance his cause in 
the earth and to help all I can to build up Zion in these latter days. 

HOME INDUSTRY. 

I have many things on my mind that I would like to refer to, but I 
feel that it would be wisdom for me to leave the heft of the speaking to 
my brethren, this morning. However, I wish to mention some things 
which I think should be brought to the attention of our people throughout 
the length and breadth of the land ; and I will simply refer to a few things 
for a moment os two in order that they may serve as a text, perhaps, for 
some others who may succeed me in speaking to you. In the good old 
davs of President Young, the doctrine of self-sustenance, of home manu- 
factories, of local providence in all things necessary to .sustain the people 
of God and the inhabitants of th : s intermountain region, were subjects 
that were dwelt upon very much, and although a little old are still new 
and deserving the attention of the Latter-day Saints especially, and not 
•only Latter-day Saints but all the people of this intermountain country. 
In early days we sought to be content and to be happy by using those 
things which we could as far as possible produce at home. The condi- 
tions of those days made it necessary for us to be economical and for us 
to make an effort on our part to provide everything as far as possible by

our own energy and skill, that we needed. But we have advanced in 
wealth ; money has become easier to get and more plentiful ; transportation 
across the deserts and from distant parts of our country has become easy, 
and it has become so simple and so easy to buy the shoddy which is a few 
cents less per yard, or piece, which is manufactured in great manufactories 
in the East or in Europe, by labor which is compensated for at the least 
possible wages, and shipped easily to this country, that we prefer to 
patronize the laborers that are afar off to patronizing those who are in 
our own midst and who would be depending upon the patronage of the 
people of this intermountain region to support them in their labors. We 
have sought to manufacture clothing in our Provo Woolen Mills and in 
other of our manufactories that have been from time to time established 
in the early days, but the goods that have been manufactured in Provo, 
which surpassed very far in real value the imported articles. of a similar 
kind, because they were made of whole wool, had to seek a market in 
New York and in San Francisco, and in Europe, because the people at 
home would not patronize home made goods. Why? Because they could 
not be made quite as cheap as imported shoddy ! These are facts, for I 
have been associated with this factory somewhat in years past, and I 
know whereof I speak. It is an easy matter now to get a great many 
things from the East, and from the West, and pay our money out for 
them, which we ought to produce at home ; and there are a great many 
things brought into our country that we purchase with our money that 
we do not need at all, and which ought never to be imported for the use 
of Latter-day Saints. 

SOME SURPRISING FACTS. 

No Latter-day Saint has any use for tobacco in any form, and yet 
many thousands of dollars are paid out annually for this noxious weed 
which is grown in the south, manufactured in the south and shipped here, 
of course, for the money it takes away, and otherwise merely to do you 
harm, and absolutely no good. It was .surprising to me to learn that we 
actually ship eggs by the ton from various distant states, into Utah. It 
appears to me that it is really a shame and a disgrace to our credit and 
good name, that the people of this intermountain region, the farmers, the 
ranchers, the home-makers, and home-dwellers, cannot raise poultry 
enough to supply themselves and the market at home with eggs and 
chickens, instead of having to import them from abroad. Why cannot 
we make our own butter and our own cheese, at home ? Why would not 
these industries pay our own people as well as they would pay or profit 
others? Surely they would, if our people would be as loyal in supporting 
them in their labors and in their manufactories as we are loyal to those 
that are far away. 

The matter has been called to our attention of late that we are im- 
porting a great deal more into Utah and into the principal cities of Utah 
than we are exporting abroad. We are allowing our fruit year after year 
to rot on the ground by the ton, if not by the hundreds of tons, when a 
few years ago we were sufficiently interested in home preservation and

home production that we would dry some of our peaches and some of our 
apples that are now going to waste, for winter use and for transportation 
abroad. We have quit it. . Scarcely any one will .dry a peach now! I 
have been trying, year after year, to get a few dried peaches to help eke 
out my provender during the winter season for my family; and there is 
nowhere that I can get good dried peaches in Utah, and yet they are 
wasting by. the hundreds of tons, by the tens of thousands of dollars 
worth, because they are not taken care of properly. This is wrong. We 
should adopt the rule to live within our own means, and attempt, at least, 
again to save the products of the soil, the products of our herds, and of 
our flocks, import as little as possible, and supply as much as we possibly 
can for our own support, and for transportation. 

A STRANGE KIND OF ECONOMY. 

We have been having the doctrine of economy thrust down our 
throats for all it is worth recently, to such an extent that we scarcely 
know sometimes where we are at. A poor man will go to the store to 
get twenty-five or fifty pounds of flour, and the storekeepers will compel 
him to buy at least twenty-five or fifty pounds of some other material that 
he doesn't want or need, or know what to do with, if he had it, and he is 
.compelled to buy it or go without the flour. That is a strange kind of 
economy for the poor people. A poor man goes to the store and he says, 
"I want twenty-five pounds of flour." "All right, you have got to buy 
twenty-five pounds of bran or of something else" which he does not need, 
and pay a good deal more for it, before he can get his flour. What? 
The poor man under the necessity, when he must have a little flour for 
bread — (and he can't afford to go to the bakers to get it, because they 
have raised so high on their prices that he can't afford to go there to buy 
bread,) and he must get the flour and let his wife bake it, but he is told 
that he can't have flour unless he will buy at least one and one-fourth 
more material of one kind or another of greater cost to him than the 
flour will be. 

THE REMEDY. 

It would be a mighty good thing if every farmer, gardener, owner of 
an orchard or a hennery, or a flock of sheep, or any other means of sub- 
sistence in the land, would provide for themselves everything that they 
need at home, and not go to the stores at all unless the store keepers would 
treat them fairly. I have no fault to find with stores nor with the keepers 
of them. They are necessary in their spheres of business. But I would 
not go to a store to get what I did not need, nor what I could produce for 
myself ; there are many things people can do without with profit to 
themselves. 

Who am I finding fault with? I don't want to find fault with any- 
body, nor with anybody's methods of economy. I am not doing this in 
the spirit of fault-finding. I am saying what I am, in the spirit that we 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH:

should provide for ourselves so that we will not be dependent upon im- 
ported goods, more especially dependent for flour imported from abroad 
instead of producing flour at home and to transport abroad. Utah, by its 
irrigation system, can almost beat the world in raising more bushels of 
wheat to the acre than can be raised anywhere else. 

Now, I wanted at least to say this much to you, that we ought not 
to spend our means in importing into our country things we can raise at 
home ; and surely not those things that are injurious, nauseating and 
hurtful .to life. We ought to let them alone. I don't believe that it is 
really necessary for the Latter-day Saints to import tea and ooffee into 
Utah. I believe they could makeshift with something more simple, some- 
thing less injurious, perhaps, than these things that are more or less stim- 
ulating and not nourishing, the effects of which are more injurious than 
beneficial. 

LOYAL TO THE GOVERNMENT. 

I wish to say this, there isn't a feeling in my soul nor in any fibre of 
my being that is disloyal to the Government of the United States or to 
the desire that we have in our souls to maintain the principles of indi- 
vidual and National liberty, justice and freedom that have been estab- 
lished in the Constitution of our country. I believe in the Constitution of 
the United States. I believe in the principles which that instrument pro- 
mulgates — the freedom of mankind to do right, to worship God according 
to the dictates of their own consc'ence, freedom to pursue their way in 
peace and to observe and maintain their rights, their freedom, their liber- 
ties, and justly recognize and equally preserve and defend the rights, 
freedom and liberty of their neighbors and of their fellow bemgs — and of 
all of God's creatures. I believe that the Constitution of the United States 
was and still is an inspired instrument. The Lord God Almighty inspired 
the minds that framed it, and I believe it ought to be most sacredly pre- 
served. It is worthy of the defense and should be upheld by all the people 
of our land. I cannot say that I indorse always some of the acts 'of 
leading men. Now, the Lord bless you. 

FINANCIAL, SOCIAL AND STATISTICAL FACTS. 

I had prepared a few items that I wanted to name. I am going to 
depart from my intended rule this morning, and finish while I am on my 
feet. It may be a source of information to the Latter-day Saints, at least, 
and will be gratifying to them to know in some measure what has become 
of their tithes and of their offerings which have been handled by the 
bishops of the Church, and which have come into the office of the Pre- 
siding Bishopric, where the strictest possible accounts have been kept of 
them. I have had the B : shor>'s office jot down for me a few items that 
I will take the liberty, since I am on my feet, and am stronger than I 
thought I would be. to read to you :

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There have been expended in the stakes and wards for local 
purposes, of the tithes, in 1917, divided among all the local 
organizations of the Church $751,978.00 

Expended for the maintenance and up-keep of temples, includ- 
ing repairs on the St. George and the Logan temples, 
which latter suffered some considerable loss by fire during 

the same year 111,036.00 

Expended on the constructon of the Cardston and Hawaiian 

temples, during 1917 126,745.00 

Expended for the maintenance and operation of the Church 

schools, 1917 368,028.00 

Expended for charitable purposes, including hospitals 320,963.00 

Expended for mission purposes, including the erection of mis- 
sion houses and chapels 335,861.00 

Expended for the completion of the new Church Office Build- 
ing, 1917 154,878.00 

Tithe payers that we have on record number 87,663 

People who paid fast offerings during 1917 number 47,820 

Wards and independent branches number . t 839 

Number of .stakes 75 

Number of missions 22 

The birth rate among .the Latter-day Saints is 37 to each 1,000 
Church members. 

The marriage rate is 17 to each 1,000 Church members. 

The death rate is 8.1 to each 1,000 Church members. 

There are 33 widows to each 1,000 Church members, and there are 7 
widowers to each 1,000 Church members. If they are not too old they 
ought to get married aga : n. 

The divorced after Temple marriage are 80 persons. 

The divorced after Civil marriage, 101 persons. That will prove to 
you, I judge, that a Church marriage is very much .stronger and more 
binding than a civil marriage. 

Families among the Latter-day Saints who own their own homes, 80 
per cent. 

Since our last conference, the following changes have taken place 
among the Presidents of Stakes, Presidents of Missions, etc. : 

Bear River stake, Peter M. Hansen, appointed to succeed Milton H. 
Welling. 

Montpelier stake, formerly a part of Bear Lake stake, Edward C. 
Rich appointed pres : dent. 

Bear Lake stake, William L. Rich, appointed to succeed Joseph R. 
Shepherd. 

Nebo stake, Joseph Reece succeeded the late Jonathan S. Page, Jr., 
who recently passed away. 

Samoan Mission, Ernest Wright has been released and Willard A. 
Keith appointed to succeed him as president.

The following' bishops have passed away : Lars P. Nielson of the 
Ovid ward, Bear Lake stake ; Charles L. M. Milne, Union ward, Jordan 
stake, and Robert McQuarrie of the Ogden Second ward, Weber stake. 

The following- brethren laboring in the mission field have passed 
away : Arnold Joseph Kunzler, Rosetta, Utah, died in the Central States 
Mission, at Springfield, Mo., October 8, 1917, of typhoid fever. Joseph 
F. Seeley, Mount Pleasant, Utah, died in the Central States Mission, 
March 29, 1918, of heart failure. 

Now, I shall most happily turn over the remaining part of the services 
of this meeting, perhaps through the conference, to my brethren. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

I feel happy this morning that our President has been able to speak 
unto us and to give us the key-note for the conference. He has the love 
of the Saints, and they all pray that his life may be spared and that he 
may be strengthened to overcome his affk'ction. We like to hear his 
voice, we like to be in his company, and we ask the Lord to spare his life 
yet many years for the good of the Saints. I have listened with interest 
to the remarks he has made this morning. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM. 

President Smith alluded to certain things that we ought not to import, 
and I thousfht of reading to vou just a few paragraphs of that blessed 
Word of Wisdom which the Lord has given unto the Saints, a word of 
wisdom indeed, and many of those who do not belong to our religion, but 
understand what is harmful and what is good for the human body, ac- 
knowledge that it is wholesome advice to all. The Lord says : 

And, a o-ain, strong drinks are not for the belly but for the washing of 
your bodies. 

And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with 
judgment and skill. 

And ag;ain, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained 
for the constitution, nature, and us.e of man. 

Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof, all 
these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have 
ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be 
used sparingly; 

And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used only in times of 
winter, or of cold, or famine. 

All grain is ordained for the usie of man and of beasts, to be the staff of 
life, not only for man. but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, 
and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; 

And these hath God made for the use of man, only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ADVANTAGES OF PROHIBITION. 

I believe that we will be both healthier and richer if we follow the 
advice not to partake of the things forbidden therein. I am glad that our 
State has prohibition, and I hope that the time will come when all of our 
neighboring states will follow suit, and pass laws against the manufacture 
and use of intoxicating drinks. If they do pass such laws as we have here 
in Utah and Idaho, I believe that the bootleggers' profession will soon be 
at an end, and I certainly hope that we will be able to cope with that class 
of men who are in favor of making a living by selling these destructive 
things. I believe that the people living under prohibition laws will be 
able to save more means than those who live where the saloon is licensed, 
with which savings they will be able to make the family comfortable, to 
build better homes and to help to sustain our Nation in its time of need. 
I would advise all the Latter-day Saints to make a study of the words I 
have read to you th : s morning and to obey them. We call it the Word 
of Wisdom. It is, and the Lord has given it to us for our- good. He is 
not depriving us of pleasure or of enjoyment in forbidding these things. 
Those who enjoy them do so by first accustoming themselves to the use of 
them. Tobacco is not nourishing; in fact, it is opposed to good digestion, 
and gives pleasure only to such as have created a desire for it, and can 
hardly be without it, having created so strong a habit that instead of 
being master of it they become its servant and slave. Latter-day Saints 
should make themselves free, free from habits that are injurious, and they 
should have strength enough to abstain from that which is not good for 
the body, as well as to abstain from doing things that are hurtful to the 
spirit. 

THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF CHILDREN. 

I would like to allude to another matter. The Lord has blessed us 
with children, and to most of the parents they are their most precious 
gifts. We ought to look after our children, brethren and sisters. We 
hear reports from juvenile courts that cause us sorrow and regret, that is, 
regret for those who have not watched their children and taken care of 
them. Children raised in loving homes are not as exposed or as likely to be 
led astray as are those who have homes where instead of love there is 
quarreling between their parents who have formed habits of degrading 
vice. Fathers and mothers, take care of your children, see that they are 
properly taught, see to it that they do not form vicious habits ; and make 
home as happy as you possibly can for them, that home may be an attrac- 
tive place. Do what you can to make your children understand that which 
is right, instil in their hearts faith in God and see to it that they learn 
what is the Lord's will for them to do here upon the earth. What a great 
duty the training of children is, which has been laid upon the Latter-day 
Saints and upon all people ! 

I do not want to shake the confidence of the parents in their children. 
I know that God has given us that blessed love for our children that we 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND. 

can hardly see any faults in them, but remember that all are liable to have 
faults, and hence they must be trained aright. Parents, do not feel too 
confident that your children are safe wherever they go. We have so many 
attractions at night ; the moving picture shows are cheap and our young 
people like to go there. I will not say that moving picture shows are 
always bad. Many of them teach desirable lessons, and when used to 
instruct in that which is useful, the picture show may be a power for good 
in a community, but where pictures represent things just to amuse and 
even try to make laughable things which are not pure and good, then they 
do a great deal of harm. 

See to it that your children attend their Sunday School. What a 
blessed place for the children to go on a Sunday morning ! Here we find 
all ages of children from the little tots of the kindergarten to the young 
men and ladies and even married people, now that we have parents' classes 
also in the Sunday School. Children like to be there. They rejoice in 
the singing. They are graded so that their teachers can reach their little 
hearts and give them instruction suited to their needs. They are happier 
for going to the school than to roam in the streets or get into company 
of boys and girls, who like themselves are truants. 

There are also the Primaries. Here our good sisters teach them and 
endeavor to turn their hearts to love that which is good. We want also 
our Religion Classes and Church Schools sustained. I am pleased with 
the good work that is being done in these institutions, also with the intro- 
duction of our seminaries. By having a seminary close to the high school, 
our high school students can go there and in addition to their other studies 
receive lessons in theology and in Bible h-'story. These studies are for 
their good, and they help to stave off influences tending to infidelity and 
loss of faith. 

Parents, guard your children, and know where they are and what they 
are doing, guard them against imbibing the modern ideas of believing the 
world to be a self-running machine, and that God is not needed in it. That 
there is a God, used to be considered a truth that needed no demonstra- 
tion. So sure was David that he writes, "The fool hath said in his heart, 
there is no God." We want our children to be reared in a firm belief in 
God and that he is the author of their being, and is their Father. We 
should teach them that without him they could not even breathe or have 
life here, for he is the Author of life. 

Let us instil reverence and love in their hearts for God, and for our 
Savior, let them know what the Savior has done for us, and that there is 
no doubt in our hearts about this, but that we know it is a truth. When 
they love their parents they will believe what these teach them, and do not 
let that time pass in which we have the : r full confidence and let them 
grow up in ignorance of Godliness, for then we may find that they have 
learned other things and have come to doubt even the existence of God. 
There is a great danger before our young people in modern ideas that are 
being taught them, and we want to be on our guard that they take the 
word of God, the iron rod, and cling to it, for then they will be safe in 
their pilgrimage through life

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OUR ATTITUDE ON THE GREAT WAR. 

Today we are hearing of the gruesome things that are taking place 
over in Europe. We are anxious to learn the news from there. It is a 
year ago now since we entered the war. Many have thought that the 
United States did not need to go into this war, but our lawmakers, the 
President and his Cabinet, found it a necessity for the United States to 
join those with whom they are now allied across the water, to put down 
the idea that might is right, and that the strong man can enter the house 
of the weaker one and destroy him and his possessions. Some have said, 
"Well, why not let them take care of their own affairs and we defend our 
land when an invasion is made here?" We do not want to wait for this. 
Our duty is not to ourselves alone but to our neighbors as well. 

When we were troubled with the Black Hawk war in Sanpete county, 
you folks in Salt Lake did not say : "Let them take care of themselves up 
there." "We are not afraid that the Indians will come to Salt Lake City;" 
but you sent a large company of young men to try to keep the Indians 
under control, and we appreciated it. We found what a hardship and loss 
it was to be at war then, and we certainly were grateful to our brethren 
from the lower counties who helped us. 

Today we are trying to combat a power that wants to dominate, that 
has already laid plans to divide Europe and go down through Asia to the 
Persian Gulf or to the Indian Ocean. If this plan succeeds they can turn 
their power to the right or to the left, and it would be very hard to quell 
or stop any attack thus made. The United States have gone into this 
war with the most unselfish motives. I do not know of any other nation 
that has been so unselfish in offering its means and even sending its young 
men to help those who are distressed and who are attacked without cause. 
What had Belgium done that it should be overrun and destroyed? What 
had France done at that time, and Russia even? Germany, no doubt, 
thought that with such splendidly discplined armies as she, together with 
Austria, had— for we must admit that these armies are well equipped and 
disciplined — she had power enough to subdue both France and Russia, 
and then England would have its turn. But she found that by the united 
effort of these nations that were attacked the victory was not accomplished 
so easily as she thought. 

THE AMBITIONS OF GERMANY. 

You take the Hohenzollern — I perhaps should not mention a certain 
family — but they claim and are proud to say that ever since they got Bran- 
denburg by purchase and acqirired East Prussia, each successive ruler has 
been able to add something to the patrimony left him ; and this is perhaps 
true, but in what way? How have they acquired these great portions of 
land that they now possess ? They attacked Austria under Maria Theresa 
and took from # her Silesia ; and afterwards together with Russia and 
Austria they divided Poland and each took a large slice of it, leaving no 
Poland, only by name : they took three duchies from Denmark in 1864. 



PRESIDENT ANT HON H. LUND.

Austria and Prussia quarreled about who should have them, which led to 
war, and then, Austria being- defeated, additional land came to the Hohen- 
zollerns ; and then by Bismarck stirring up France and getting Napoleon 
the Third to go into a snare so that he declared war against Germany, 
which country in a short time conquered France and made her pay a 
large indemnity and took two large provinces from her. In such a way 
Germany has grown, and can we believe that if they come out victorious 
they will lose this lust of gain and desire to enlarge their kingdom? 
Today we -do not look upon the Atlantic as being so great a defense or 
safeguard against Europe as we did in the days of the revolution. Then 
they had to send soldiers in sail ships and it took them a long time to get 
across the ocean, but today the Atlantic can be crossed in a few days, and 
we do not yet know to what extent air transportation will grow. This 
war has developed aviation to become an important arm in the war, and 
likewise the submarine. What a danger the latter is to shipping ! We are 
not so safe today from Europe as we might think, and the wise men of 
our Nation have decided that we should be prepared — prepared to meet 
foes not only from the east, but even from the west. A nation like us, 
unprepared, even with our large numbers of men, could not defend itself 
against a smaller power with disciplined troops. So, in any case, let us 
be prepared and help to encourage our boys who go to defend the cause 
we have adopted. 

OUR DUTY IN THE GREAT STRUGGLE. 

The Nation has already spent a great deal of means, and more means 
will be needed. The Latter-day Saints whom I address now ought to do 
their share, and not feel to leave it alone, but do as they have done in the 
past, meet the demands that are made upon them. War is a costly and a 
horrible thing, and I believe if this war can be won that peace will be 
more permanent and stable. If it is not won, it will not be long till the 
question will have to be tried again. 

TOLERATION FOR THE GERMAN SAINTS. 

I want to say a few words about our German Saints. They are 
placed in a difficult position. Their neighbors are so likely to look upon 
them as being perhaps alien enemies, and in some cases as spies. Now I 
want to say that the great majority of Germans who have come to this 
land and have become citizens of the United States, I believe are honest 
in having taken the oath of allegiance and that they love this country. 
There are, however, a great many enemy agents who are doing much 
harm, for instance, destroying the government property, ammunition 
plants, railroad bridges, and so on, trying to do everything to stop the 
success of the United States in preparing material for the war. We can- 
not wonder, therefore, that the feeling of bitterness has arisen against the 
Germans. In fact, the espionage of Germany extends to a greater length 
than history has ever known. In nearly every land there are spies in the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pay of the kaiser, and they are keeping his government posted on what is 
going on both here and in other lands. But this should not make us 
intolerant to those who have come here and become good, honest citizens. 
That large, earnest German-American citizensh : p should not suffer. Our 
brethren who joined the Church in Germany, who felt the yoke of auto- 
cracy there and came to this country to be free to serve God according to 
the dictates of their conscience — I am sure are not of the kind that would 
sustain an alien country against ours. I believe that they are true Amer- 
ican citizens. They have had enough of the oppression over in Germany. 

I remember when I last visited Berlin in company with President 
Penrose that we met during the day with the elders there. They had 
been called together and we had a splendid time with them, and in the 
evening our hall was crowded with Saints and their friends. Good testi- 
monies were borne and all enjoyed the spirit of it. After the meeting 
was closed the president of the mission, Brother Thomas E. McKay, came 
to us and said : "Now I can breathe more freely. All day I have 
feared that the police would come and arrest you brethren." 

Well, we did not experience that treatment at that time, but Brother 
Rudger Clawson afterwards had to go into a Berlin jail because he was 
found in company with Latter-day Saints. Now, those people have suf- 
fered for their religion's sake there and have come here and enjoyed the 
full freedom to worship God according to their belief, and they are not 
hankering to go again under the German autocracy. 

I shall not take more of your time. I rejoice in being with you, and 
I hope that you will remember the counsels given us by our President. 
Let us be tolerant towards our brethren and sisters of German extraction. 
Let us be careful about our children, that they be raised in a God-fearing 
manner, and let us ourselves give them such an example as .shall be worthy 
of following. This is my advice ; and may God bless us all, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



A tenor solo : 'Forever with the 
Lord," was sung by Joseph Mon- 
carr. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of the Southern States 
Mission) 

"Behold," saith the Lord, "the 
world is ripening in iniquity, and it 
must needs be that the children of 
men are stirred up unto repentance, 
both the Gentiles and also the house 
of Israel." Adam said unto the 
Lord : "Why is it that men must 
repent and be baptized in water?" 



And the Lord answered him, say- 
ing: 

Inasmuch as thy children have been 
conceived in sin, even so when they 
begin to grow up, sin conceiveth in 
their hearts, and they taste the bitter 
that they may know to prize the 
good. And it is given them to know 
good from evil, wherefore they are 
agents unto themselves, and I have 
given unto you another law and com- 
mandment. Wherefore teach it unto 
your children, that all men, every- 
where, must repent, or they can in 
no wise inherit the kingdom of God, 
for no unclean thing can dwell there, 
or dwell in his presence (Book of 
Moses 6:53-57). 

In the Book of Mormon we read 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



13 



that because of the Fall our na- 
tures have become evil continually. 
The gospel is the power which God 
has given to make us clean and to 
win the victory over the world 
which will place us in line for eter- 
nal exaltation. 

This terrible war is turning the 
people unto the Lord. In the mis- 
sion where I have the privilege of 
laboring with some of your sons 
and daughters, there is plain evi- 
dence that the war is proving to 
many of the children of men a sanc- 
tifying affliction. In this hour of 
peril they are turning to the God 
of heaven, confessing their sins 
and seeking light and truth and sal- 
vation by obeying the gospel. Men 
are beginning to lose much of their 
love for the visible and tangible 
things of the world ; they are reach- 
ing out unto the things which can- 
not be seen only by the eye of faith. 
They are seeking for the things of 
immortality. 

A prominent minister declared, 
in an address before a convention 
recently, that there were prominent 
Protestant families following their 
soldier dead into the other world 
with their prayers. The leaven of 
the gospel, we can see, is working. 
In truth it is becoming more ap- 
parent to men and women that the 
gospel is indeed the power of God 
unto salvation. It is the means of 
salvation, the entrance, for all that 
obey it, into the kingdom of God. 

The President of the Church, in 
the power and authority of his of- 
fice, this morning, stirred Israel up 
unto the necessity of becoming 
more self-sustaining in raising on 
our farms, and manufacturing at 
home, the necessaries of life. Breth- 
ren and sisters, it will redound to 
our benefit, temporally and spirit- 



ually, if we give heed to the ad- 
monition and instruction we re- 
ceived from him. 

When the Lord Jesus was tak- 
ing leave of his apostles, he said 
unto them : "Ye shall be witnesses 
unto me both in Jerusalem and in 
Judea, and in Samaria, and unto 
the uttermost parts of the earth." 
It is our testimony, a living, abid- 
ing testimony, that we are bearing 
unto the children of men, that three 
of these apostles whom Jesus was 
addressing did come to the utter- 
most parts of the earth, and, upon 
Joseph Smith bestowed the holy 
Melchizedek Priesthood, which is 
the power to preach the. gospel of 
repentance, to baptize by immersion 
for the remission of sins, and to 
bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
whose office it is to guide into all 
the truth of God. Did this actu- 
ally come to pass? Did Peter, 
James and John come from man- 
sions of glory and invest Joseph 
Smith with that sacred power? 
We in the mission field, witnessing 
the marvelous effect of the gospel 
on the hearts of men, rejoicing in 
the glorious manifestations and the 
testimony which the Saints receive 
after they make covenant with God 
in the waters of baptism, earnestly 
testify that these things are a stand- 
ing testimony that these apostles 
did come and endow the Prophet 
with this splendid: power — "the 
power to act in the earth, in the 
name of the Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost, for the salvation of men." 

We further testify that this 
power and authority has attended 
the men who have succeeded the 
Prophet Joseph Smith; that this 
power and influence is wielded in 
the world today by the men who 
stand at the head of the Church.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The blessings we receive in the 
house of the Lord ; the success your 
sons and daughters are meeting 
with in preaching the gospel, con- 
stitute an abiding testimony that 
the power and influence placed up- 
on Joseph Smith, the authority con- 
ferred upon him by Peter, James 
and John, has been bestowed upon, 
abides with, and is exercised by, the 
President of the Church today, and 
it dwells also with those who are 
associated with him. My brethren 
and sisters, I bear testimony to this 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



President Heber J. Grant gave 
notice of the general priesthood 
meeting to be held in the Taber- 
nacle, this evening at 7:30 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"Do what is right, the day dawn is 
breaking." 

The closing prayer was pro- 
nounced by Elder Sylvester Q. Can- 
non, President of the Pioneer stake 
of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 



President Joseph F. Smith pre- 
sided and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: "O say what is truth?" 



Prayer was offered by Elder Rey 
L. Pratt, of the Mexican Mission. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
'"Though deepening trials throng 
the way." • 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

It is with great joy and thanksgiving that I am able to meet this 
afternoon in this congregation with the Latter-day Saints in general con- 
ference. You who sit down in the body of the audience cannot look upon 
this vast congregation as we do who are on the stand. We have a mag- 
nificent sight before us. The beauty of the congregation is enhanced in 
my view by the absence of so much millinery as we used to have in our 
congregations many years ago. We not only behold the countenances of 
our brethren, even the bald heads, but also we can see the faces of our 
sisters, not disfigured by any frills or furbelows or artificial flowers or 
anv encumbrance, and the view is very fine. I rejoice in it. If it was 
only to look upon this congregation this afternoon that I was privileged 
to do, I should feel very thankful, but having the opportunity of saying 
a few words, bearing my testimony to the truth of the great work in 
which we are all engaged, I am doublv thankful; also for the measure of 
health and strength that I have, as during the winter that is about over, I 
hope, I have been somewhat affected by the errippe. I either had the 
grippe or the grippe had me ; perhaps both. But T am able to be here 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



15 



today and to rejoice in the good things that have been given to us, the 
words spoken by our President. this morning and by President Lund and 
by Brother Callis who bore a powerful testimony at the close of the 
services. I enjoyed it all very much, and I rejoice in the Spirit that is 
present this afternoon, and hope that by its help I may be able to say 
something worthy of your hearing and remembrance. 

I have prepared no discourse for this conference ; I am not in the 
habit of doing that. Still, I'have ideas passing through my mind, but I. 
generally find when I come to conference that the things I thought about 
are not those that come to my memory, so I have to trust in the inspiration 
of the time, which I do now, desiring in my soul that I may say that 
which is rght and which can be understood by those who listen, and will 
be of profit to somebody if not to everybody present. 

HOME PRODUCTION AND HOME SAVINGS 

This morning when the President was speaking in regard to the con- 
servation of our foodstuffs and our production of the things that we need 
for home consumption, and the wisdom of sending out for export as much 
or more, if possible, than that which comes in, I reverted to the old in- 
structions given years and years ago in this house, and sometimes before 
this house was erected, by President Brigham Young and his then imme- 
diate associates. That was one of their regular themes — home production 
and home savings. We have a good deal of talk now about the con- 
servation of our products. Well, we have been in the habit, or were some 
years ago, of practicing this. It was one of the texts preached upon and 
one of the policies urged upon us, and, to a very great, extent, carried out 
as far as we could in the conditions in which we were then placed. But 
latterly there has been, no doubt, very much extravagance. What I mean 
by that is not getting a number of things we were not able to get, but 
having our desjres, our wishes, go beyond our necessities and indulging 
in luxuries, some of which are not beneficial, but to the contrary, to the 
human body. These things were pointed out to us this morning very 
clearly, and I hope those remarks will have their impression upon the 
Latter-day Saints. 

It is very poor policy for a people like us to be exporting little or 
nothing and importing a great deal, importing very often things that we 
could produce ourselves at home, if we would be prudent and wise and 
industrious and careful. Particularly I have noticed the waste of fruit, 
bushels and bushels rotting upon the ground, and then sending to Cali- 
fornia for canned fruit. There is no place where we can get better 
peaches than we can raise right here in LItah. They have a special good 
flavor to me. When I have been away from here and could get a peach 
raised in Utah, it was indeed a peach to me. I speak of this merely as a 
sample of other things that we do, waste what we raise at home, then send 
out and buy it from abroad. It is very poor policy and I echo the re- 
mark that it is indeed a shame and a d ; sgrace to some of us. I know that 
there are excuses for this and some reasons perhaps, but I think that the 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



intimation made to us by the President this morning should be sufficient 
to us all to do what we can to save that which we produce and to put it 
to good use, not to "strew our ways to strangers" or strew our fruits on 
the ground to be of no use to anybody. I think if we will get that idea 
into our minds it will suffice in regard to a great many things that we do 
produce, and perhaps stir us up to produce things that we do not now 
bring forth either from the ground or by our industry and our skill. 

SAVIORS ON MOUNT ZION 

I have thought during this conference many times of a text which 
we have used very freely in the world, not particularly in relation to this 
subject, but, I think, just as applicable to it as to other things, that in the 
last days "saviors should come up on Mount Zion -to judge the mount of 
Esau ; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's." If my memory serves me 
right, it is the last verse in the book of Obadiah, in the Old Testament 
scriptures. We have used that text a good deal in regard to the salvation 
of the dead. I have seen a periodical recently in which it is stated that 
the only way in which we can become saviors on Mount Zion, is to be 
baptized for our dead. Without des'ring to say one word against that, I 
would only like to strike out the word "only." I think there are many 
ways by which the Latter-day Saints can become "saviors on Mount 
Zion." The work that we are doing for the dead, performing for those 
who have departed, ordinances which they cannot themselves attend to, 
but which we can do for them by proxy, is a grand and glorious work, 
and I am pleased to know that it is going on to a very large extent. In 
all the temples that are built, the four temples that we now have in our 
use, thousands upon thousands of baptisms for the dead are performed 
from month to month, and we have the reports come to us in the Presi- 
dent's Office so that we can see what is being done in that direction, and 
the work is really marvelous. Of course, when we consider the hosts of 
the departed who are in the spirit world and who never had the oppor- 
tunity of receiving those ordinances of salvation, the number may appear 
rather small by comparison, but the work will go on not only in th : s con- 
dition that we find ourselves in, but when the glorious millennial day shall 
be fully ushered in, temples will be built at various points on this great 
land of Zion which extends from the north of the continent to the south 
thereof, and the work for the dead will continue, and the saviors on Mount 
Zion will be multiplied in our posterity, if we happen to have gone away 
from here by that time, and it will go on until the work is fully consum- 
mated, and all that is needful to be done shall be performed for the re- 
demption of those who have passed away without having an opportunitv 
of hearing the gospel and obeying the commandments of the Lord in 
relation thereunto. 

It is a grand and glorious work, and I wish to impress it upon the 
minds of my brethren and sisters gathered in this great audience today, 
that a duty rests upon them to continue this work, and to do all that they 
can that it may be properly accomplished according to the mind and will 
and commandment of the Lord, for the commandment is upon us and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



17 



it is necessary to our perfection as well as the perfection of our ancestors 
that these ordinances shall be performed, and none of our work will be 
wasted. The time will come when those who do not at first accept the 
gospel even in the spirit world will, through the experiences which they 
will have to suffer, be willing to bow the knee to King Emmanuel and 
acknowledge him to be the Lord, to the glory of God, the Father, and 
every ordinance performed for them will stand in its place and effect its' 
object at some period or other. 

MANY WAYS OF BEING SAVIORS 

But there are a great many other things in which we can be saviors. 
We can be saviors if we carry out the instructions given to us this morn- 
ing, that is, to take care of that which we produce and put it to proper 
service, and use it in preference to sending away to other places to get 
articles that would be perhaps inferior ; but, whether or not, that we should 
use that with which the Lord has blest us in the land that he has given 
to us in these mountain valleys and which can be made to produce almost 
everything that is absolutely necessary for our comfort and convenience 
as a people and as individuals. If we will take away with us from this 
conference the desire and determination in our hearts that we will carry 
out this instruction in the spirit and meaning thereof, it will amount to 
a great deal for the spiritual as well as the temporal salvation of the people 
and everyone will be a savior on Mount Zion who aids in this glorious 
work. 

We are to be saviors of men, too, in sending or carrying the gospel 
to every nation, kindred and tongue and people. That is imposed upon 
us; that is required of us. We are here on the earth with a mission to 
perform. Every Latter-day Saint, every man and woman and boy and 
girl born in the covenant or who has received it, is under obligations to 
do all that is possible for the sending forth of the word of the Lord to 
all the nations of the earth. A good many of my brethren here on this 
stand and around have been out to the world, and we have done our part 
as far as we could in sounding a warning to the nations of the earth. We 
have traveled extensively among the nations that are now at war. We 
have preached and lifted up our voices and warned them of troubles and 
judgments to come, and now these things are upon them. We see the 
fulfilment of the words of the Lord ; and while we do not rejoice in human 
suffering, we cannot help rejoicing in the fact that the Lord made known 
to us, years and years ago, that these things would come, and showed us 
how we might escape and. help others to escape them. I remember the 
words of Isaiah, the prophet, which we have often quoted, where he says 
unto Zion : 

''Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about 
thee: Hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be 
overpast. 

"For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants 
of the earth for their iniquity: The earth also shall disclose her blood, and 
shall no more cover her slain" (Isa. 26:20,21), 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



These things have been literally fulfilled in our time and our ex- 
perience ; and how thankful we ought to be that we are here in these 
chambers of the mountains, that Zion, bringing good tidings, has come 
up into the high mountain as Isaiah predicted, that we are here dwelling 
in quiet places and peaceable resting- places just as Isaiah saw that we 
would in the latter days, (chap, 32) and that in the midst of the troubles 
and .dangers that are abroad in the world, we have the consolation of 
having done our duty and warned the inhabitants of the earth of judg- 
ments to come. And the Lord sard that after our testimony would come 
the testimony of earthquakes and of the waves of the sea heaving them- 
selves beyond their bounds, of floods and fire and flame and the sword 
and wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes in divers places, and these 
are but "the beginnings of sorrows" for the latter davs. Now, we have 
done a great deal in warning the inhabitants of the earth concerning this, 
and those who have gone forth weeping sometimes, have come back bear- 
ing precious seeds and planted them right here in the chambers of these 
mountains, and we are surrounded by peace and good-will and kindness of 
heart among the ranks of the Latter-day Saints. 

Sometimes there is a little riffle here and there, a little contention, a 
little dispute, a little strife, but in the main "the peace of God that passeth 
all understanding" rests down in the hearts and in the homes of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We can bow down before the Lord in the morning and 
in the evening and ask his blessings upon us when we partake of "food, 
in the spirit of peace and kindness and charity and love for all, and we 
desire in our souls the welfare and salvation of mankind, and whatever 
there is to do in this direction we feel that we want to do it. As a people 
we have done something towards helping in bringing about the reign of 
truth and liberty and the establishment of good government and ' right- 
eousness in the earth, but the end is rot yet, and the work has yet to be 
done and there is more for us to do, that we may be indeed assistants in 
the salvation of mankind in these troublous times that have come upon 
the world. Our boys who go forth to the front representing us, go out 
in that spirit, as saviors who have come out of Mount Zion, bearing with 
them the sp : rit of Zion, setting a good example to their comrades, taking 
a course which will show that we are a people that observe the laws of 
health and of strength and of virility of manhood, living clean lives set- 
ting a good example to the world, and they are objects of the admiration 
of others who do not practice such good things. 

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SALVATION. 

Now, "the end is not vet," as I have said. More will have to °o 
more means will have to be raised to carry on th : s good work and we 
are not doing it in the spirit of conquest or of a desire merely for victorv 
over our fellow creatures, except to establish righteousness and truth and 
peace m the earth. The grand and glorious principles referred to bv our 
President this morning embod:e<1 in the Constitution of our country have 
to be proclaimed, and if by means of war onlv they can b e proclaimed 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



19 



the war will have to come and we will have to engage in the good work 
at any cost and at any sacrifice. In this our cause is .salvation. We want 
to -save the nations from bondage, from tyranny, from oppression, from 
the grasp of avarice and ambition. As alluded to by President Lund, 
there is a power in Europe which seeks to overspread the world and bring 
the whole earth under bondage. But the principles embodied in the Con- 
stitution of our country are at variance with this, and it is part of our 
mission as children of the Lord, as saviors on Mount Zion, to carry the 
spirit of good government, to establish peace on righteous principles, to 
extend freedom to all mankind, freedom to the full extent of human 
rights, preservative also of the rights of others. That is the genius of 
our government and this has to be carried abroad, and we had to go into 
strife "willy-nilly." We are with our country in this conflict. Let us be 
reasonable. Let us be liberal also in our feelings, not narrowed up in our 
souls, but feel that we are engaged in a great and glorious work for the 
salvation of humanity from oppression and tyranny and autocracy. That 
is part of our duty, part of our work as saviors. 

The elders will remember that years ago we used to repeat that it was 
predicted by the Prophet Joseph Smith that the t : me would come when 
even the very Constitution of our country would be in danger, and the 
elders of this Church would arise in the might and the power of the Holy 
priesthood and bear the standard of liberty aloft, and save, or help to save, 
this country, from the evils of oppression and tyranny and bloodshed. 
Let us remember these things and while we are doing the work of salva- 
tion for the dead, let us continue in the work of salvation for the living. 
Let us produce that which we need for our own sustenance and comfort, 
and what we save thereby we can use for the benefit of people abroad, and 
we can plant in the hearts of our children a desire to do that which is 
right, to keep God's commandments, and train them up in the ranks of his 
kingdom, for "the kingdom is the Lord's." It is true, that we Latter-day 
Saints in these mountains in Utah, form a part of the great government 
of the United States. That is all right ; thank God for it, that we have 
influence in this Nation and that our influence is growing and we are get- 
ting better understood, and the way is opening up for the fulfilment of all 
things spoken of concerning Z ; on and her power in the earth ; and let us 
use that power in wisdom and in righteousness, with discretion and judg- 
ment, and not go crazy about anything. 

TRAINING OUR CHILDREN IN RIGHTEOUSNESS 

Now, in regard to our children. Brother Lund said considerable on 
this matter this morning. That is right. Let us train up our children in 
all things that are mentioned in our Sunday Schools, in our Religion 
Classes, in our Primary departments and in those for the older members 
of the youth of Zion, the Mutual Improvement Associations, sustaining 
at the same tine that great and glorious institution, the Relief Society. 
All these auxiliaries are necessary in the Church ; and the Sunday Schools, 
of course ; they form a very great part. Brother Lund talked about them 
this morning, and I am adding a few words to what he said, which I wish 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to emphasize. There is need for us to instruct our children at home and 
in the Sunday School and in these classes, in morality, in honesty, in truth- 
fulness and in integrity. 

A number of our children, it appears to me, do not have impressed 
fully upon their minds the need of telling the truth and of avoiding lies, 
falsehoods. They do not, all of them, understand the rightfulness and the 
benefits of using for themselves only that which is their own. I don't 
want to particularize too closely, but I have known of children who had 
just come out of Sunday School going rampant into orchards and steal- 
ing fruit, not thinking that they were doing very much harm, perhaps 
encouraged by the notion that a great deal of it was wasting on the 
ground. 

So, I see the need of teaching our children not only the Word of 
Wisdom, to abstain from certain things, I will not say a word against 
that, by any means, I would emphasize that, train up our children to do 
without these things that are injurious to the human body, but also instil 
into them, in the home particularly, truthfulness, honesty, integrity, re- 
spect for the rights of others. Don't let little children take toys that 
belong to their brothers and sisters without the permission of those to 
whom they belong. That is the idea. That is only a small matter, but 
the great principle is to train up our boys and girls that they will be hon- 
est and tell the truth, that they will not lie, that they will not take things 
that do not belong to them, that they will respect the rights of others. 
That is one of the fundamental principles of our faith. We want the 
privilege of worshiping God according to the dictates of our own con- 
sciences, unmolested, and we want to give that privilege to all mankind. 
That is part of our religion. So let us remember this, and in the school- 
ing of our children don't forget to teach them these fundamental prin- 
ciples of righteousness and truth, for therein will be the strength of our 
people. Righteousness exalteth a nation. 

PEACE WILL NOT COME WITHOUT RIGHTEOUSNESS. 

We must have righteous government, good government or peace 
will not continue, but there will be war and trouble and strife and blood- 
shed and all the ills that have afflicted humanity for many years past 
But the turning time is near at hand, the time of peace is to come and 
the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ our Redeemer, is to come and be King 
of kings and Lord of lords. b 

I believe in that with all my heart. I believe in Jesus Christ as 
an individual, not merely as an idea, not merely as a light not merely 
as an influence, but I believe in Jesus as the son of Mary and the Son of 
God, that he was the only begotten of the Father in the flesh and that 
he lived and set a splendid example, committing no sin, doin- no evil 
obeying every commandment of the Father, and thus being a sinless being 
he could offer himself voluntarily as a sacrifice for sinners, and he

it will take some time to bring it about. Of course, we understand that 
certain things predicted through the Prophet Joseph Smith are to take' 
place before tnis generation shall pass away, and the Lord will see to it 
that the generation in which those things were predicted will not all pass 
away until all shall be fulfilled, but there is no fixed period for a gen- 
eration, no set time in the revelations of God, no year or date given when 
these things shall take place, and it is folly for anybody to put a date to 
it. Leave that in the hands of the Lord and he will take care. that his 
word is fulfilled; "not one jot or one tittle shall pass away," as Jesus de- 
clared, "but all shall be fulfilled." 

REVERENCE FOR THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD. 

In training up* our children we must also plant in their minds belief 
in and reverence for a living and true God, the Father of their spirits, 
that they may learn the lesson that Paul taught, that "we have fathers of 
our flesh who corrected us and we gave them reverence, but how much 
rather should we be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live." 
Belief in a Being, a personal God, that is the very foundation and be- 
ginning of our faith. "We believe in God, the Father, and in Jesus Christ, 
his Son, and 'in the Holy Ghost," and we believe in them as individuals 
who are at the head, who form the presiding quorum as a trinity in unity, 
the power being in them and proceeding forth from them, and "by and 
through them and of them the worlds were created, and the inhabitants 
thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." And in sending out 
of the State for books of instruction for our children, let us be careful 
that we don't bring in too much of the nonsense that is incorporated in 
some of the text-books of the times, the ideas and notions of men, the 
theories and inferences and reasonings of men, not real, solid, substantial 
facts or the actual truth. God is the Author of all things in the universe 
that have been organized for . progress and for salvation and for bless- 
ing. He is at the head of this Church. 

REVELATIONS OF THE PROPHET THE WORD OF GOD. 

The revelations that we have are not simply utterances of the 
Prophet Joseph or others to whom they have been given. They are the 
word of the Lord. Don't let us forget that. When we talk about Joseph 
Smith as a scientist, that is all right when we go to show that things 
revealed to him as truths have since been received and understood by the 
learned of the age and have come to them without knowing that he pre- 
dicted them, but was he their author? We do not pit him against 
them, but we take the word of the Lord, and don't let us forget 
that it is the word of the Lord that has come to. us, and this Church is 
founded upon it. Christ prayed to the Father concerning his disciples, 
"Father, sanctify them by the truth, thy word is truth." The word of 
the Lord, my brethren and sisters, is truth and can be relied upon, and 
we can take our stand upon it and bring everything to it, and that should 
be with us the standard. We don't want to prevent men from thinking. 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I have heard some of my brethren say, "Well, do you want to stop men 
from thinking?" Not at all. Liberty to think and liberty to act upon 
the thought if you don't infringe the rights of others. Liberty to think, 
liberty to read, liberty to have theories and notions and ideas ; but, my 
brethren, it isn't your province nor mine to introduce theories into the 
Church that are not in accordance with the revelations that have been 
given. Don't forget that. And if any change in policy, is to be introduced, 
it is to come through the proper channel. The Lord said only his ser- 
vant Joseph should do that while he lived, and then after he died others 
were to be called to occupy the place, and the key is in the hands of the 
man who stands at the head, if any change is to be introduced in our 
Church. Don't let us fix our minds too much on the ideas and notions 
that are called science. If it is really science that they produce, some- 
thing demonstrated, something proved to be true, that is all right, and 
there is not a doctrine of our Church that I can find that comes in direct 
conflict or contradiction to the sciences of the times if they are sciences, 
but a great deal of that which is called science is only philosophy, and 
much of it speculative philosophy, and these ideas change with the ages, 
as we can see by reference to what has been called science in times that 
are past. 

WHAT WE SHOULD DO AS SAVIORS OF MEN. 

Now, brethren, what I am after is this: Let us Latter-day Saints, 
called to be saviors of men, called to be saviors of this world, called to 
be saviors to introduce that which will save mankind and bring them 
up from their lowest state into a condition where they will be fit to hold 
converse with Deity, let us be careful that we plant in the minds of our 
children the truth and nothing but the truth so far as we can understand 
it, and as to the opinions and notions of men, value them for what they 
are, if they have any value, and some of them do. not have any, but many 
of them do. We do not want to cripple men's minds, we do not want to 
wean men from investigating and reaching out into the field of thought. 
1 he boundless universe is before us all to learn and to live and to come 
up to the standard occupied by our Eternal Father and to be fit for his 
society. Let our minds enlarge, our understanding increase and let ev- 
erything that is proved to be true and established and demonstrated 
come m to us as part of our belief, but the theories and notions of men 
that are m contradiction to the revelations of Almighty God are not to 
be considered m the light that some people view them. Let us be verv 
careful about these things. 

Now, we want to teach these things to our children, train them up 
to believe m the living and true God, the Author of our being, our Father 
in heaven, and in Jesus Christ, his Son, who died for us ^ and without 
whose redemption, as we read in the Book of Mormon, our spirits would 
have been banished forever from the divine presence, and our bodies 
would have mouldered in the dust forever. But through that atonement 
wrought out by Jesus Christ, and by our obedience to his commandments 
we shall come forth from the dust and stand upon our feet and have all 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 2i 

things that we have made ourselves fit for by our own acts. Forgive- 
ness of sins, redemption from personal sin, is a doctrine of Christ to be 
obtained in the way that he has appointed. He died that we might live, 
and thus he atoned for the sin of Adam. He died that we might live 
and attain glory if we would repent and obey his commandments and 
receive the blessings in the way he has appointed ; and our mission in 
the world here, what we have come on the earth to do, is to live that 
gospel and carry it to the ends of the earth and send it forth to all peo- 
ple, that all nations may hear the glorious sound of the glad tidings of 
salvation to the human race. And when we have done with our earthly 
work and gone into the world of spirits, that we might be allowed there 
to carry it to any part of the spirit spheres, even into the lowest hell, 
if necessary, in the great work of saviors of the children of men, so that 
the laws of God might be proclaimed, that God's truths might be made 
known, that opportunity might be given to all the race of Adam, in the 
body or out of the body, to receive the truth and walk in its light, and 
come as near as possible, considering their conditions and transactions 
and doings, as near as possible to the light and glory and presence of the 
Father. These are themes that are very simple, very plain, very clear 
to us all. 

> 

UNITY AMONG THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH. 

Now, let us live according to the teachings given tc us this morn- 
ing, walk in the ways of the Lord, teach them to our children, set a good 
example to all the world, put away from us everything that is contral- 
to the mind and will of the Lord, and become sanctified before him, a 
holy and a mighty people, saviors on Mount Zion, and our kingdom, or 
the kingdom that we are in is indeed the Lord's and we will be his peo - 
ple. May his peace abide with you, may the blessings and power of God 
rest down upon President Smith and heal him up fully, and upon all our 
brethren who are laboring with him. I want to say that we are united. 
There is no jar, no contention, no quarreling among the leaders of the 
Church. We are united in spirit. We bless and praise the Lord for his 
goodness to us. We enjoy each other's presence and company and soci- 
ety. We are a band of brethren. We are knitted and united together. 
We are one before the Lord as near as human beings can be with the 
failings and .weaknesses of mortality ; and we love the children of men, 
and we want to see salvation come to all people who will receive it. We 
want to see salvation come to this nation, we want the principles of the 
government of the United States to be exalted here and eventually 
throughout the world, as the preparation for the coming of him whose 
right it is to reign, Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God. 

May the peace and blessings of God abide with you all, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred duet : "Hail to the ing," was sung by Prof. J. R. Bosh- 
brightness of Zion's glad morn- ard and Marie Hedquist.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

I rejoice in being- permitted again to meet with the Saints in general 
conference. I do most earnestly and humbly pray that the Lord will 
assist me to give utterance to some of the thoughts which have come into 
my mind during the last few months and while listening to the remarks 
made since our conference opened, and to the beautiful songs sung in our 
hearing. I do not desire to say one word that shall offend, or that shall 
not be in keeping with the inspiration of the Lord. In all humility I 
desire the assistance of your faith and your prayers, that what I may say 
may be for the benefit of the Latter-day Saints here assembled. 

HYMNS APPROPRIATE TO PRESENT CONDITIONS. 

It has seemed to me that the hymns sung in our hearing since this 
conference opened are wonderfully appropriate to the present condition 
of affairs in all the world. I believe in very deed that it is a time when 
the Latter-day Saints should feel in their hearts the inspiration which 
came to Brother William Clayton when the great pioneer, Brigham 
Young, told him to write a hymn that should cheer and bless the Saints 
in their great pioneer journey to these fair valleys. Brother Clayton 
wrote: "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, but with joy wend 
your way." And again: "Why should we think to earn a great reward, 
if we now shun the fight?" And again: "And .should we die before our 
journey's through, happy day, all is well." I feel that we are entering 
today, as a part of our grand Nation, upon a great and wonderful journey, 
that we are engaging in a war of righteousness in which the Nation is 
risking its life, a war which undoubtedly will mean death to many of the 
noble boys who have volunteered or been drafted into the army and navy. 
I feel that every Latter-day Saint can with fervent spirit sing this splendid 
pioneer hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear," and that 
those who have an abiding faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and his redeem- 
ing blood, should go forth to war under the inspiration of the Lord, and 
that they can honestly and conscientiously pray that the Lord will pre- 
serve and bless them and give them success, even in war. 

I think one of the grandest hymns which has ever been written by 
any of our local poets is John Jaques' 

Say, IV hat is Truth:' 

O say, what is truth? Tis the fairest gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce; 
And priceless the value of truth will be when 
The proud monarch's costliest diadem 

Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or gods can aspire ; 
Go search in the depths where it glittering lies. 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies; 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



2 b 



The scepter may fall from the despot's grasp 

When with winds of stern justice he copes, 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast, 
And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes. 

Then, say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er: 
Though the heavens depart, and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

"out of their own mouths." 

A couple of days ago a friend of mine lent me this book that I have 
not yet read. It is entitle:!, Out of their own Mouths, and the scripture 
quotation, "Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee," is on the cover 
of the book. Sentiments which are anything but true. Speaking of 
truth, let me quote from Frederick the Great. Frederick was one of the 
men who stole those provinces and robbed other people of their posses- 
sions, as referred to by President Lund this morning. 

If there is anything to be gained by it, we will be honest; if deception is 
necessary, let us be cheats. — Frederick II, Letter to Minister Radziwill. 

Remember this standard of "Truth" of Frederick the Great : 

Do not be ashamed to make alliances with a view to gaining advantage 
'from them for yourself only. 

Do not commit the gross blunder of not abandoning them when it suits 
your interest. 

One takes when one can, and one is wrong only when obliged to give back. 

I understand by the word "policy" that one must make it his study to de- 
ceive others; that is the way to get the better of them— Works of Frederick II, 
Berlin edition (1848). 

No ministers at home, but clerks. No ministers abroad, but spies. 

Form alliances only in order to sow animosities. 

Kindle and prolong war between my neighbors. 

Always promise help and never send it. 

There is only one person in the kingdom, that is myself. — Marginal notes 
in a copy of Tacitus, written by the King and cited by Diderot. 

"All written constitutions are only scraps of paper." — Frederick Wil- 
liam IV, Speech from the Throne, April 11, 1847. Remember in contrast 
our beloved "Mormon" poet John Jaques' inspired words : "Truth, the 
sum of existence, will weather the worst, eternal, unchanged, evermore." 

Here are some of the truthful ( ?) statements of the present kaiser 
of Germany. When meeting a general and the governor of the province 
of Liege, he said when they visited Berlin : 

"You are the governor of a province with which we have always 
maintained good neighborly relations. Recently, I understand, you have 
felt in your country serious apprehensions. Believe me, these apprehen- 
sions were unnecessary." 



26 



« 

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And at a banquet following- the interview, he said to the general from 
Belgium: "You were quite right to trust us." The solemn word of 
honor of a nation guaranteed the neutrality of Belgium, but that word of 
honor was a "scrap of paper." "You do right to trust us." By trusting 
that emperor, what came? The destruction by the thousands and tens of 
thousands of Belgium's citizens, the destroying of their property, the levy- 
ing upon them of vast sums, the taking of millions of the nation as pris- 
oners, and making them work in as hateful a slavery as existed in the 
South before the days of the rebellion. 

We shall conquer everywhere, even though we be surrounded by enemies 
on all sides; for there lives a powerful ally, the old, good God in heaven, who 
* * * has always been on our side. — William II, Speech, March 28, 1901. 

He talks as familiarly as the man who profanes the name of the 
living God. It is a profanation of the living God to talk about his being 
on the side of a nation which breaks its solemn pledges, and treats con- 
stitutions and treaties as "scraps of paper." 

I believe, as does our beloved President Joseph F. Smith, that the 
Constitution of the United States was written by the inspiration of 
Almighty God. I was taught this from the knee of my dear mother, who 
has passed to her reward in heaven. I know that any ruler who claims 
to be the representative of Almighty God who would take away the lib- 
erties of his fellow men, is not a representative from God. You can draw 
your own conclusions whom he does represent. I was going to tell, but 
maybe I would better not. 

Remember that you are the chosen people! The Spirit of the Lord has 
descended upon me because J am the Emperor of the Germans! 

I am the instrument of the Almighty. I am his sword, his agent. Woe 
and death to all those who shall oppose my will! Woe and death to those who 
do not believe in my mission! Woe and death to the cowards! 

Let them perish, all the enemies of the German people! God demands 
their destruction, God who, by my mouth, bids you to do his will! — William II, 
Proclamation to the Army of the East, 1914. 

No honest person need be told where the inspiration for such a 
damnable statement comes. 

The triumph of the greater Germany, which some day must dominate all 
Europe, is the single end for which we are fighting. — William II, Proclamation, 
June, 1915. 

Not by speeches and resolutions of majorities are the great questions of 
the time decided — that was the mistake of 1848 and 1849 — but bv iron and 
blood. — Bismarck, in the Military Committee of the Prussian Chamber of 
Deputies, 1862. 

INSPIRED POEMS. 

When I was in Germany, some years aeo, while presiding over the 
European Mission, I had the pleasure of visiting many of the cities upon 
the continent, and one of the cities that I visited was Berlin, one of the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



27 



handsomest in all the world, another was Dresden. While riding from 
Dresden to Berlin I read and committed to memory a poem, by Goethe, 
Germany's greatest poet. I believe that John Jaques, William Clayton, 
Parley P. Pratt, Eliza R. Snow and others, whose beautiful hymns we 
have heard sung here today, were inspired by the Lord. I believe that 
men like Goethe, in writing, are inspired of the Lord, when they are up- 
right and honest and endeavor to write that which is uplifting and noble. 
I would to God that every German would learn the four short verses of 
Goethe's poem as I did and realize that they are divinely inspired words : 

Three Lessons. 

There are three lessons I would write, 

Three words as with a burning pen; 
In tracings of eternal light 

Upon the hearts of men. 

Have faith, though clouds environ round 
And gladness hides her face in scorn, 

Put-off the darkness from thy brow, 
No night but hath its morn. 

Have hope where'er thy bark be driven, 
The calm distorts the tempest's mirth; 

Know this, God rules the hosts of heaven, 
The inhabitants of earth. 

I hope Kaiser William will live to have these words burned into his 
very brain : "Know this, God rules the hosts of heaven, the inhabitants 
of earth." Goethe winds up with this supreme declaration of love, a 
declaration in keeping with the teachings of our Lord and Master, Jesus 
Christ ; a declaration in keeping with the will of our Father in heaven : 

Have love — not love alone for one, 

But man as man thy brother call, 
And scatter as a circling sun 

Thy charities on all. 

WHAT THE KAISER SAYS HE IS. 

What kind of charities have been scattered by the ruling- house of 
Germany? Murder, rapine, robbery, is the kind of charity and love which 
thev have scattered. Let me read to von the words of the Kaiser from a 
book entitled, My Ideas and Ideals — William II ; 

As I look upon myself as an instrument of the Lord, I am indifferent to 
the point of view of the present day. 

I, too, like my imperial grandfather, represent the kingship by God's 
grace. 

Each of the Hohenzollern princes was from the outset of his career con- 
scious that he was only God's vicegerent upon earth. 

Again I say the inspiration of William II comes from a different 
source than from God — (the speaker here pointed downward). 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



My course is the right one, and in it I shall continue to steer. 
There is only one master in this country; I am he, and I will not tolerate 
another. 

There was only one master, so Napoleon Bonaparte thought, but he' 
did not finally triumph. "Know this, God rules the hosts of heaven, The 
inhabitants of earth;" and the kaiser will find this out if he lives long 
enough, and I hope and pray he will. 

There is only one law — my law; the law which I myself lay down. 

There is the law of justice, there is the law of virtue, there is the 
law of honor, there is the law of Almighty God, that this man and those 
who sustain him are violating, and they will find it out ! 

The best word is a blow — the Army and Navy are the pillars of the State. 

An immense amount of inspiration from Alm : ghty God in this in- 
famous statement. The following sentence of less than three lines tells 
whether this man represents the Lord Almighty or not : 

Hurrah for the dry powder and the sharp sword, for the end we have in 
sight and the forces we are bending towards it, for the German Army and the 
General Staff. 

A fine representative of God ! 

PAN-GERMANISM. 

I had the privilege of becoming acquainted on the steamer with a 
German who was returning from Japan, who had been there training the 
Japanese army. I learned that he believed that nrght was right, and that 
weak nations had no right to live. The teachings of our Father in 
heaven and of our Redeemer are just the exact opposite of any doctrines 
of that kind. I recommend you to read a book entitled Pan-Germany, a 
little twenty-five-cent pamphlet. You will find that Germany started out 
to do exactly what President Lund said they expected to do, to gain 
dominion through the heart of Europe from the North Sea clear down 
to the Persian Gulf; and if they get peace today, without indemnities they 
have won the war. Germany has since the beginning of this conflict 
placed over 75,000,000 people under her dominion, and she is working 
millions of these people in her fields and factories. 

WHAT GERMANY WOULD DO. 

For example, they worked one girl in the harvest fields from sun-up 
until dark, and they pa : d her for six mortal months' labor less than two 
dollars. From the time that the war broke out until February, a year 
ago, the National Imperial Bank increased its reserves from 1,300,000,000 
marks to 2,500,000.000 marks. They are enslaving Turkey and Austria- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT, 



29 



Hungary financially by selling to them the munitions of war which are 
used in the interest of the German empire. Their allies have been prac- 
tically bankrupted by Germany running a printing press and furnishing 
them money. Today if Germany could get peace without indemnities she 
could enslave the world. The kaiser claims to be the representative of 
God, but he knows nothing about the laws of God, or of justice, and this 
is why he will eventually be defeated. The Lord has said that this land 
of America is a choice land above all other lands, and that if the people 
are pure in heart and serve him, that it shall be preserved from any king 
ever ruling here. That is the word of God to his ancient servants upon 
this continent, as recorded in the Book of Mormon. The Kaiser mistook 
the fiber of the Belgian people. He thought might was so great in the 
empire that he ruled over, that the Belgians would not dare oppose him. 
but those Belgians gave their lives for truth and honor. He thought that 
France would not dare fight, but the Frenchmen offered their lives upon 
the altar of honor. He never dreamed for a moment that England un- 
prepared would enter the war, but again he mistook the character of the 
English people. He instructed his legions to "destroy the little contempti- 
ble English army." He believed that he had the might' to crush them, 
but the people of England stepped forward with that sense of honor, 
right and justice which is inborn in her people, and fulfilled her pledges 
to Belgium. 

AN INFAMOUS CONCEPTION. 

Now I want to read to you -one of the most infamous things that was 
ever conceived by a ruling class : 

In 1895, when Germany decided upon what she wanted, (viz., to conquer 
the world,) she proceeded to make a list of all Germans on the face of the 
globe, in order to pick out from among them those who were most likely to 
prove useful tools of carrying out the Pan-German plan. The result of this 
registration of the German element throughout the world may be found in the 
Pan-German Atlas of Paul Langhans, published by Justus Perthes, at Gotha, in 
1909. (The Pan-German plan was to split Europe through the center and 
eventually to conquer the world.) 

The Pan-German societies have carried on a vigorous propaganda among 
all these Germans, especially since 1900, and in Argentina and Brazil, which 
were intended to be the principal German protectorates, they were organized 
with particular care. The German law of July 22, 1913, known as Delbruck's, 
which deals with nationality under the Empire and under the State, _ has greatly 
favored German organization in America, and it is important to know at least 
the gist of it, since it is full of significance, and marks the last stage of Pan- 
German organization prior to the war. 

The second part of its article 25, reads as follows: "If any person before 
acquiring nationality in a foreign state shall have received the written per- 
mission of a competent authority of his native state to retain his nationality of 
that state, he shall not lose his nationality of the said native state. The Ger- 
man consul shall be consulted before this permission is granted." 

•"From these words we can measure the depth of German astuteness," 
and pardon my saying, we can measure the depth of depravity of the Ger- 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



man statesmen, who ask men to bold up their hands before high heaven 
and pledge allegiance to another country, when they never intended to 
fulfil that pledge made in solemn covenant before God. "According to 
this provision a German may become a citizen of a foreign state but if 
he obtains a written permission 'from a competent authority of his native 
State,' he still continues to enjoy, for himself and his descendants, all the 
rights of a German citizen, and may claim the protection of the German 
Empire." Such a law is infamous beyond my language to tell. 

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE WAR IN UTAH. 



I want to read what we have done here in Utah for the war in which 
we are engaged — a brief summary made on December 21, 1917: 

Men Supplied by Utah. 

Army — quota asked for 746 men 

Furnished • 2,344 men 

Marines — quota asked for 126 men 

Furnished 346 men 

Navy — no quota — Utah and Southern Idaho furnished 641 men 

Utah also furnished one regiment of field artillery and one field hospital .. 1,500 

Asked, 872; given, 4,831 men. 

Red Cross — apportionment $350,000 

Raised $520^000

NO QUESTION EVER SETTLED UNTIL IT'S SETTLED RIGHT. 

Allow me to read to you the inspired words of Ella Wheeler Wilcox. 
She has entitled her poem 



An Inspiration. 

However the battle is ended, 

Though proudly the victor comes, 
With fluttering flags and prancing steeds 

And echo of rolling drums, 
Still truth proclaims the motto, 

In letters of living light, 
No question is ever settled 

Until it is settled right. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

Though the heel of the strong oppressor 

May grind the weak in the dust; 
And the voices of fame with one acclaim 

May call him great and just; 
Let those who applaud take warning 

And keep this motto in sight — 
No question is ever settled 

Until it is settled right. 

Let those who have failed take courage, 

Though the enemy seems to have won; 
Though his ranks are strong, if he be in the wrong, 

The battle is not yet done; 
For sure as the morning follows 

The darkest hour of the night, 
No question is ever settled 

Until it is settled right. 

O man, bowed down with labor, 

O woman, young, yet old; 
O heart, oppressed in the toiler's breast, 

And crushed by the power of gold, 
Keep on with your weary battle 

Against triumphant might; 
No question is ever settled 

Until it is settled right. 

Let me again quote Goethe : "Know this, God rules the hosts of 
heaven, the inhabitants of earth." 

LOYALTY OF GERMAN LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

In my anxiety to get through with as many items as possible in 
twenty-five minutes I came near neglecting to say one thing which I desire 
to say : I have never traveled with a man who impressed me more as 
loving God, and more determined to give to this work of our Redeemer 
his life's labor, than did the late Karl G. Maeser. I believe that the men 
and women that the gospel found in Germany, and who in all honor em- 
braced it, are as loyal, as true, and as patriotic as any other people who 
have joined the Church of Christ. The night following my call for a 
mission to Japan I lay awake until after three o'clock in the morning, and 
in thinking of those who were aged, and whom I hoped and prayed 
might live until I returned, I thought of my own dear mother, of John R. 
Winder, of George Romney, of Karl G. Maeser, and of others whom I 
loved with all my heart. I feel that the Germans who have embraced the 
Truth and who have the love of God and the love of our Redeemer in 
their hearts, are as willing to go forth to battle against wrong and error 
as the people of any other nation who have embraced the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

May the Lord help us who know the Truth to go on proclaiming it, 
and bringing people to a knowledge of the Redeemer, and teaching them 
to love their fellow men instead of robbing and killing them, is my prayer 
and desire, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Obtaining knowledge by study and by 
faith — Value of the book of Genesis 
— It answers perfectly the false doc- 
trine of evolution — The law of mar- 
riage instituted that mankind might 
multiply and replenish the earth — 
Relationship of Abraham to us and 
the world — The lesson of obedience 
in the lives of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob 1 — The blessings of these patri- 
archs have come down to us — Mod- 
ern Scripture to be studied, and also 
the counsels of the living oracles. 

Brethren and sisters, "The glory 
of God is intelligence," and this 
great truth is confirmed and em- 
phasized in another statement oc- 
curring in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. The Lord, in speaking to 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, said : 
"As all have not' faith, seek ye dili- 
gently and teach one another words 
of wisdom ; seek ye out of the best 
books words of wisdom. Seek 
learning even by study and also bv 
faith." 

I take it that this is very im- 
portant counsel to the Church of 
God. We know that there are two 
ways of getting intelligence — one is 
by .study, the other is by faith ; and 
these two methods go well hand in 
hand. The injunction is that we 
should seek words of wisdom out 
of the best books. The world to- 
day is full of literature. There are 
very many good books, but as mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ I as- 
sume we will agree that the very 
best books in the world today are 
the standard church works — the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants, and the 
Pearl of Great Price. Take, for ex- 
ample, the Bible. This book, breth- 
ren and sisters, has come down 
through the centuries of the past 
and is hoary with age, but never- 



theless it breathes forth the very 
strength and vigor of youth. It 
contains many wise sayings and 
thrilling" incidents and teachings of 
priceless value. From this book 
and other church works we are con- 
stantly taking lessons and compil- 
ing them into manuals and sending 
them forth into our various organi- 
zations and priesthood classes and 
auxiliary associations, but . these 
books are especially recommended 
for general use throughout the 
Church and for careful study, and 
should often be consulted by Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

Referring to the Bible, I may say 
that if there was not one vestige of 
the Holy Record left to us but the 
book of Genesis, it would still be 
worth while, and would be of price- 
less value to the children of men. 
In the first chapter of Genesis many 
valuable truths are imparted. We 
learn that God created the heavens 
and the earth and all things that in 
them are. We are also given to 
understand in this matter of crea- 
tion that the Lord operated and 
worked in an orderly way and by 
law, for we are told that the Lord 
God of heaven and his Son Jesus 
Christ work by law, that in the be- 
ginning things came into being by 
the power of God. God* said, "Let 
there be light," and there was light, 
and this was effected, as I have just 
said, by the power of God. 

We are told that God made the 
beasts of the earth after their kind, 
and the fishes of the sea after their 
kind, and the winged fowl of the air 
after its kind, and every creeping 
thing that creepeth upon the earth, 
after its kind. And the Lord saw 
that they were good, and he blessed 
them, saying, "Multiply and fill the 
waters of the deep, Let the fowl 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



33 



multiply upon the earth." But the 
supreme creative act came with the 
appearance of man. ''And the Lord 
said, Let us make man in our own 
image and after our likeness, and 
let him have dominion over the 
fishes of the sea and the fowls of 
the air and over the earth and every 
living creature." "So God made 
man in his own image, in his own 
image made he him, male and fe- 
male created he them." But the 
Lord did not stop there, he blessed 
them and he said, "Be fruitful and 
multiply and replenish the earth 
and subdue it and have dominion 
over it," and so forth. 

Now, it seems to me that there is 
to be a very great lesson learned 
from this important chapter in the 
Bible. In the first place, I think 
that it answers perfectly the false 
doctrine of evolution. We are dis- 
tinctly given to understand that 
every living creature was made 
after its kind. We are not to ex- 
pect that a lion will grow into a 
horse, or that a cow will grow into 
an elephant, but we have reason to 
believe that a horse will always be 
a horse. You may be able to im- 
prove the horse, but it will still be 
a horse, and so with the other , ani- 
mals of God's creation. 

And since man in the beginning 
was made in the imag'e of God and 
after his likeness, and since he is 
still in the image of God and will 
so continue, we have no reason to 
conclude that there has ever been 
any change at all in the order of 
things as first instituted. 

Furthermore, you will remember, 
and there is a great lesson in it, 
that God commanded these living 
creatures throughout all the animal 
kingdom as also man to be fruitful 
and multiply and replenish the 



earth, but man could not properly 
do this without matrimony, and so 
God instituted the law of marriage 
in the garden of Eden. We must 
know from this that marriage is 
honorable, because it originated 
with the Almighty. He introduced 
it in the garden of Eden, and this 
law has since prevailed throughout 
the earth. But we also find in many 
places and in very many instances 
that the command of God is not 
obeyed, and that people, even those 
who are married, sometimes do not 
fulfil this obligation, for they are 
not fruitful and do not multiply and 
replenish the earth. In that partic- 
ular they come short. This ought 
not to be so with the Latter-day 
Saints. It is expected of us that 
we shall be a fruitful people, that 
we shall become a numerous people, 
that the Church shall g'row until it 
shall fill the whole earth, because it 
has in it the spirit of endurance. 
As Latter-day Saints we must of 
necessity obey this great and im- 
portant law of marriage. That is 
one of the lessons that comes down 
to us from the very beginning. 

How very beautiful, brethren and 
sisters, is the story of the patriarchs, 
our progenitors. What would we 
know about them, how could we 
ascertain their names, how coukl we 
learn what they did, if it were not 
for the record, and I ask you can- 
didly, how could we know anyhow, 
unless we searched the record and 
made a study of it, because I take 
it that you cannot find any knowl- 
edge in the mind of man that is not 
put there. 

Take Abraham, for instance. 
Have you ever thought of him? 
Have you ever considered his re- 
lationship to us and to the world? 
It seems upon one occasion that God 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



appeared unto Abraham and com- 
manded him to* leave his country 
and go out from among his own 
people into a strange, land. Abra- 
ham did not hesitate. He obeyed 
the voice of God willingly, and- 
when he came into this strange 
country the Lord said to him, "Lift 
up now thine eyes from the place 
where thou art to the northward 
and the southward, to the eastward 
and the westward, for all the land 
that thou seest, to thee will I give it 
and to thy seed, and I will make thy 
seed as the dust of the earth, so that 
if any man can number the dust of 
the earth, so also shall thy seed be 
numbered." What a wonderful say- 
ing, what a glorious promise ! and 
the lesson that we can draw from 
it is that Abraham was obedient, he 
was willing to follow the voice of 
counsel and to do the will of God, 
and thus he secured a blessing. 
Upon another occasion he was sub- 
iected to a very severe test, as great, 
I think, as any test that could come 
to us or any one of us. The Lord 
commanded him to take his beloved 
son, the son of promise, to take 
Isaac up into a mountain and offer 
up as a sacrifice to the Lord. 
To do this he must needs slay his 
son with his own hand. But he did 
not hesitate. No. It was the com- 
mand of God. He responded read- 
ily — I would not say willingly — it 
must have been a great sorrow to 
him, but he was obedient and the 
Lord accepted this act upon the part 
of Abraham as a sign of obedience 
and of righteousness, and did not 
require the sacrifice. After the 
offering was made then came the 
blessing, in other words, after the 
sacr'fice comes the blessing. The 
Lord then said to Abraham, "By 
myself have I sworn, saith the 



Lord, for because thou hast done 
this thing and hast not withheld thy 
son, thine only son, that in blessing 
I will bless thee and in multiplying 
I will multiply thy seed as the stars 
of heaven and as the sand upon the 
sea shore, and thy .seed shall possess 
the gate of his enemies, and in thee 
and in thy seed all the nations of 
the earth shall be blessed." What 
greater promise than this could 
come to a man, and yet it came 
through the righteousness of Abra- 
ham through the spirit of obedience. 
It is a very great lesson. Latter-day 
Saints, and we should take it to 
heart. We should cultivate the 
spirit of obedience in our hearts, be 
willing to listen to the voice of God, 
and walk by the counsels of his ser- 
vants who are divinely called. 

The blessing - that was put upon 
Abraham was also conferred upon 
Isaac, for Isaac as a boy and as a 
man exhibited the spirit of submis- 
sion and obedience. He honored his 
parents. They desired him to go 
down artiong his people and kindred 
for a wife rather than marry among 
strangers, or among the daughters 
of the Canaanites. 

Isaac yielded to the wish of his 
parents. He honored them, and God 
honored him, and put upon him the 
blessing of Abraham. 

And so it was with Jacob. He 
was willing to listen to the voice of 
his parents, and went down among 
his people to get a wife, while Esau 
seeing that it displeased his parents 
went straightway among strangers 
and married some of the daughters 
of Canaan. Now, in the one case 
the displeasure of the Lord was 
shown, and in the other case the 
blessing followed, because the bless- 
ings that were put upon Abraham 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



35 



and Isaac were also put upon Jacob, 
and thus, brethren and sisters, the 
names of those great patriarchs 
were linked together, and they were 
called Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
The Lord himself has greatly hon- 
ored them by sometimes saying, "I 
am the God of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob." Jacob was further distin- 
guished by a change in his name. 
The Lord said to him upon one oc- 
casion, "Thy name shall no more be 
called Jacob but Israel, for as a 
prince hast thou power with God 
and with men, and hast prevailed." 
So the name of Jacob was changed 
to Israel, and the children of Jacob 
after that were called the children 
of Israel, and the blessings of Abra- 
ham, Isaac and Jacob were pro- 
nounced upon their posterity. These 
blessings were to be realized by 
them through their righteousness, 
through their faith and faithfulness 
to the God of heaven. So the bless- 
ings of the patriarchs have come 
down to us, even to us who are as- 
sembled in this great building here, 
for we are of the posterity of Abra- 
ham, Isaac and Jacob. 

All this seems wonderful to me, 
and I have obtained the knowledge 
of it, by a study of the scriptures. 
We would do well to give attention 
to this matter, so also to the study 
of the New Testament, and the 
Book of Mormon, which is closely 
identified and connected up with the 
Bible, and the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, containing the revela- 



tions of God to his prophet and to 
his people of latter times. Oh, what 
a wonderful, marvelous book is the 
book of Covenants ! And then there 
is the Pearl of Great Price. Is it 
not beyond price, embodying, as it 
does the writings of Abraham, 
Enoch and Moses? We ought to 
familiarize ourselves with the 
scriptures that have been given. 

May the Lord bless us and sanc- 
tify to our good these great books 
which have been committed into our 
keeping ; and may he sanctify to our 
good also, the counsels of the living 
oracles, the teachings of the ser- 
vants of God in our day. Let us re- 
member them and let us receive 
their words and honor their teach- 
ings, and God will bless us and 
multiply us abundantly, which may 
he grant, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A notice of the performance of 
"Elijah" in the Tabernacle at 5 
o'clock tonight, was given out. 

It was also announced that the 
General Priesthood meeting would 
convene in the Tabernacle at 7 
o'clock tonight. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
''We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday morning at 10 o'clock. 

President Andrew Kimball, of the 
St. Joseph stake, Arizona, pro- 
nounced the benediction. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, 
April 6, 1918, 10 a. m. 

The assembly was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Come let us anew our 
journey pursue." 

Prayer was offered by President 
Edward H. Snow, of the St. George 
stake of Zion. 

The hymn, "Guide us, O thou 
great Jehovah," was sung by the 
choir and congregation. 

ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Meditation on the passino- ,of Elder 
Hyrum M. Smith — Love of the 
brethren — Gratitude for the restora- 
tion of the gospel — Men and women 
prone to turn away from righteous- 
ness and listen to the promptings of 
the evil one who minimizes sin and 
urges justification for committing 
just a little sin — Illustrations — To 
preserve men from Satan and his 
insidious ways, the gospel has been 
restored — God has said, "This is the 
path, walk ye in it" — Admonition to 
the Saints to do their duty — A 
prayer for the leaders and people of 
the Church. 

I crave an interest in your faith 
and prayers, that the Lord will di- 
rect what I may say, that it may be 
profitable to the thousands of faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints who are as- 
sembled here in the worship of the 
Lord. My heart is very tender this 
morning. While sitting here yes- 
terday and today I thought of how 
little we know of what awaits us 
or how long we will be here on 
earth. But for a knowledge of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, I would be 



filled with sorrow, remembering as 
I do that one of our beloved breth- 
ren who occupied this position just 
six months ago this Saturday morn- 
ing has been called home. It seems 
but a few days since Elder Hyrum 
M. Smith stood here where I stand, 
about this hour in the day, and de- 
livered to us, under the inspiration 
of the Spirit of God, his mes- 
sage to the Latter-day Saints. It is 
true that his voice is stilled as far 
as we are concerned here, but the 
teachings that he advocated on that 
day are not stilled, and no doubt 
there are many in this audience who 
will remember the very topics that 
he touched upon on that occasion 
If you do not remember, let me re- 
fresh your minds just a little. He 
referred to the fact that Solomon 
did not pray for riches, did not pray 
for honors, but he prayed for an 
understanding heart, and God told 
him that because he had prayed for 
that desirable thing, that he had not 
only given to him an understanding 
heart, but that he had given him, in 
addition, honor and riches, and that 
not any of the kings of his time 
would be like unto him. Another 
thing Brother Hyrum referred to 
was the teaching of Moses, wherein, 
after advising the people and ad- 
monishing them, he said, "An.d 
teach these things to your sons and 
to your sons' sons." I think that 
is a splendid precept for Israel to 
remember today, that we explain in 
kindness and love the gospel of our 
Lord, not only to our sons, but to 
our sons' sons, and I would like to 
add, to our daughters, to our 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



37 



neighbors' sons and to all that 
it is possible for us to reach. 
Then Elder Hyrum referred to the 
teaching's of the greatest of all men 
who have lived upon the earth, 
Jesus of Nazareth, wherein he said, 
"Not everyone that saith Lord, 
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven, but he that doeth the 
will of my Father which is in 
heaven," and ' he also taught them 
"By their fruits ye shall know 
them." Now, these instructions 
have been handed down in holy 
writ and were repeated by our es- 
teemed associate just six months 
ago. Do you suppose that the teach- 
ings of that good man will be for- 
gotten by Israel? I think not, and 
he will be held in loving remem- 
brance. We honor and respect him 
and love and appreciate him for the 
good that he did and the example 
that he set us. There is no occa- 
sion for us to mourn his calling 
away, on his account, for his work 
was done, and our Father will give 
to him the things that he has la- 
bored for. I feel this morning to 
say that the splendid work he per- 
formed could not have been done so 
acceptably but for the noble woman 
who stood by his side and who as- 
sisted him and encouraged him and 
labored with him and kept his home 
and taught his children. But for 
her, the work that he performed 
could not have been accomplished ; 
and I thank God this morning that 
he has a son who gives promise of 
walking in the footsteps of his 
father, that he has children who, 
because of their love and esteem for 
the good man whose work is done, 
will delight in honoring his name. 
I am thankful, I say, for them, and 
pray God to bless them, that the 
name of Hyrum M. Smith may re- 



main and be remembered in love 
among' the Latter-day Saints be- 
cause of the family that he leaves 
to represent him in the world. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
perhaps you will understand when I 
tell you that my heart is tender this 
morning. I love my brethren, and 
I am grateful for the privilege of 
standing at the side of men such as 
have led and now lead this Church. 
I am grateful for my membership 
in this organization, and thankful 
for your companionship, as I travel 
among you in the stakes and wards 
of Zion. God bless you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, who minister to us 
who are ,so much of the time absent 
from our homes. 

Yesterday, as our beloved Presi- 
dent began to address us, my heart 
was touched. I realized how he 
was suffering the weaknesses that 
are natural to men at this time of 
life, and as he continued his re- 
marks I believe you, with me, 
offered a prayer that God would 
strengthen him and make him equal 
to the duty of presiding over this 
conference, and that he would feel 
no bad effects from that long and 
beautiful address ; and this morning 
he is with us, and I am grateful he 
says that he feels much better than 
he did yesterday. 

This is our Father's work that 
has brought us together here today. 
While this world is in confusion, 
here under the .shades of this great 
dome we have met together to wor- 
ship God and to honor him and to 
listen to the whisperings of his 
Spirit made manifest through those 
who may be called to address us. 
We are here not with doubt in our 
minds that there is a God in heav- 
en, we know that there is, and we 
know, as we know that we live, that 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this work with which we are iden- 
tified is our Father's work ; he be- 
gan it and he sent his only begotten 
Son into the world to prepare the 
way, and that in this latter day he 
called the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and taught him, as a kind and lov- 
ing father teaches a choice and fav- 
ored son, the things that touch our 
hearts and that have inspired in us 
a desire to do our best. God lives, 
and his hand is over this world, and 
the conditions that confront us to- 
day will result in repentance and 
softening of the hearts of his chil- 
dren, and many will turn from the 
error of their ways and forsake 
evil and desire to know what he 
would have them do. As I see men 
and women everywhere groping for 
the wall, oh, how grateful am I that 
those who were my ancestors re- 
ceived this gospel of our Lord, 
knew the voice of the good Shep- 
herd and followed it, and that my 
heritage has been to be reared 
among a people better than whom 
there are not in the world today. 
All these things soften my feelings 
and mellow my heart and I am 
grateful to the Lord this morning 
for his mercies. You know the peo- 
ple of the world, our brethren and 
sisters, many of them have been de- 
ceived by the cunning of the ad- 
versary, and they are led here and 
there and their time is wasted, 
while they live upon the earth, that 
might be profitably spent, not only 
to their own benefit, but to the ben- 
efit of their fellows, if they but un- 
derstood and lived the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. The adversary does 
not take them forcefully and pre- 
vent them understanding the truth, 
but in an insidious and underhand 
way he whispers to them to do this 
thing and that. He poisons their 
minds against the things that are 



true. He makes unpopular those 
tilings that are desirable to the chil- 
dren of men, and then, because of 
the habit of men and women to fol- 
low the fashion and custom of the 
world and listen to the sophistry of 
those who are prominent, he is able 
to lead them along a pathway that 
prevents them taking avantage of 
life and gaining the object of their 
creation in the world. It is not only 
now that this is the case, but it has 
been so from the beginning. When 
Abel was out with his flocks, and 
Irs brother Cain saw that he was 
favored of the Lord because he did 
right, the adversary whispered to 
Cain, "You can just as well have 
these flocks, nobody will know if 
you slay your brother," and he took 
his life. And what did he gain? 
He didn't gain anything, but he lost 
the blessing of his heavenly Father. 
He took that which he could not 
give and became a murderer and 
from henceforth his name is known 
in the earth as one who had depart- 
ed from the right and had com- 
mitted an awful crime. 

So it has been all the way down 
from that day until now. When 
the Lord sent Noah among the chil- 
dren of men to warn them and to 
teach them and to encourage them 
to works of righteousness, they 
turned away from him, they didn't 
believe he was a prophet of God. 
The adversary whispered in their 
ears, "Why, this man is only an or- 
dinary man, he has no right to speak 
in the name of the Lord, surely you 
will pay no attention to him," and 
his mission was made unpopular by 
the cunning of the adversary. Men 
and women in their sins continued 
sinful and failed to listen to the 
warning voice of a prophet of God, 
and the result was that the Lord 
could do nothing with them until 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



39 



they were repentant. He saw the 
futility of working with them be- 
cause they were wilfully in the 
hands of the adversary, and so he 
covered the earth with a great flood, 
gathering - just a little handful of 
people to re-people the earth, be- 
cause it was necessary that good 
men and good women should trans- 
mit to posterity the virtues that they 
inherited when they were created in 
the spirit world. And so it has ever 
been. In the time of the Savior the 
adversary whispered to those peo- 
ple, he is not the Son of God, surely 
you will not accept him, he is just 
an ordinary man, he is only the son 
of Mary and Joseph and he is not 
any more the Son of God than you 
are, and the people listened to that 
insidious, wicked one and crucified 
the Redeemer of mankind. The con- 
dition of the world today is pre- 
dicted in the Book of Mormon, the 
same thing exactly that I have just 
referred to. When Nephi was 
teaching the people and trying to 
show them the necessity of living 
near to the Lord, not to surrender 
to the promptings of evil, teaching 
them the necessity of keeping" all 
the commandments of God, point- 
ing out to them that the thing that 
encouraged good always came from 
our heavenly Father, and that any- 
thing that enticed them to evil came 
from the adversary and they were 
not safe the moment they went into 
the .devil's territory. This is what 
he says, referring to the time when 
the Book of Mormon should be 
brought forth, when the record 
should be taken out among the chil- 
dren of men, when the things that 
were in the book that were of great 
worth to the children of men should 
begin to be made known, and he 
speaks very plainly in this the 28th 
chapter of II Nephi : 



"For it shall come to pass in that 
day that the churches which are built 
up, and not unto the Lord, when the 
one shall say unto the other, Behold, I 
am the Lord's, and the other shall say, 
I am the Lord's. And thus shall 
everyone say that hath built up 
churches, and not unto the Lord." 

Now, the Prophet Nephi, hun- 
dreds of years ago, saw what would 
occur, that the people were to con- 
tend with one another and deny 
the power of the Holy Ghost and 
the Holy One of Israel, and were 
to teach for doctrine the command- 
ments of men. An influence is in 
the world today trying to liiake peo- 
ple believe that by their own intelli- 
gence and by their own power they 
can gain eternal life. Let me con- 
tinue to read from Nephi : 

"And there shall also be many which 
shall say, Eat, drink and be merry, 
nevertheless fear God, he will justify 
in committing a little sin." 

I want you to note that : "He will 
justify in committing a little sin." 
That cunning adversary knowing 
that if he could only get a man or 
woman to do a little wrong, that 
far they had gone into his territory, 
that far they were in his power. 

"Nevertheless, fear God, he will jus- 
tify in committing a little sin, yea, lie 
a little, take the advantag-e of one be- 
cause of his words, dig a pit for thy 
neighbor; there is no harm in this. 
And do all these things, for tomorrow 
we die; and if it so be that we are 
guilty, God will beat us with a few 
stripes, and at last we shall be saved 
in the Kingdom of God." 

Isn't that just exactly what the 
devil says to the children of men 
today as plainly as it is written 
here? Oh, commit a little sin, that 
won't 'do any harm, lie a little, that 
won't do any particular damage, the* 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord will forgive that and you will 
only be beaten with a few stripes 
and at last you shall be saved in the 
kingdom of God. That is what he 
says to the man or the woman who 
has been taught the Word of Wis- 
dom when he says, oh, drink a little 
tea, that won't hurt you ; use a little 
tobacco, that won't make any dif- 
ference : a little liquor won't do any 
harm. These are little things ; he al- 
ways does it a little at a time, not 
all at once. That is what I would 
like us to remember, my brethern, 
this morning. It is these insignifi- 
cant insidious whisperings that be- 
tray mankind and that place us in 
the power of the devil. I want to 
say to you, in my judgment, that 
the use of tobacco, a little thing as 
it seems to some men, has been the 
means of destroying- their spiritual 
life, has been the means of driving 
from them the companionship of the 
Spirit of our Father, has alienated 
them from the society of good men 
and women, and has brought upon 
them the disregard and reproach of 
the children that have been born to 
them, and yet the devil will say to 
a man. Oh, it's only a little thing! 
And Nephi says further : 

"And others will he pacify and lull 
them away into carnal security, that 
they will say. All is well in Zion; yea 
Zion prospereth, all is well; and thus 
the d evil cheateth their souls." 

Now, I want you to note that : 
"And thus the devil cheateth their 
souls and leadeth them away care- 
fully -down to hell." And that is 
the way he does it, that's exactly 
the way he does it. He does not 
come and grab you bodily and take 
you into his territory, but he whis- 
pers, "Do this little evil," and when 
he succeeds in that, another little 
evil and another, and, to use the ex- 



pression quoted, "He cheateth their 
souls." That's what he does. He 
makes you believe that you are 
gaining something when you are 
losing. So it is every time we fail 
to observe a law of God or keep a 
commandment, we are being cheat- 
ed, because there is no gain in this 
world or in the world to come but 
by obedience to the law of our 
heavenly Father. Then again, that 
peculiar suggestion, "And he lead- 
eth them carefully away .down to 
hell" is significant, that is his 
method. Men and women in the 
world today are subject to that in- 
fluence, and they are being drawn 
here and there, and that whispering 
is going on and they do not under- 
stand what the Lord desires them to 
do, but they continue in the territory 
of the evil one, subject to his power 
where the Spirit of the Lord will 
not go. He says further : 

"And behold, others he flattereth 
away, and telleth them there is no 
hell." 

Isn't that what the world is taught 
today? These higher critics, these 
agnostics, who do not believe in 
God, man, nor the devil, as far as 
that is concerned, except what they 
see. Are they not saying, "There is 
no hell ?" And Nephi here tells us 
it is the devil that teaches them 
that. 

"And behold, others he flattereth 
away, and telleth them there is ,no 
hell; and he saith unto them, I am no 
devil, for there is none; and thus he 
whispereth in their ears, until he 
Rrasps them with his awful chains, 
from whence there is no deliverance." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
that is the condition of the workl 
today. Nephi could not have stated 
it plainer if he had been right here

in the world now. And the ad- 
versary is at work, and because our 
heavenly Father desired to preserve 
his children from trie evil of that 
teaching and of that belief he sent 
the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, into 
the world, commissioned him with 
Mi vine authority, organized 'his 
Church, and began again to teach 
the truth to the children of men, 
that they might be led from the 
error of their ways. That mission 
(•'evolves upon you. You have re- 
ceived the 'Holy Melchizedek Priest- 
hood , most of you; you have been 
commissioned by divine authority-, 
and the Lord will hold us — I myself 
am with you in that, I realize — will 
hold all men who hold the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood in this Church 
responsible for the treatment of that 
priesthood and for the care with 
wh : ch we exercise it among the 
children of men. Now, my brethren 
and sisters, was there ever a time 
in the history of the world when 
there was greater need for men and 
women to serve the Lord and keep 
his commandments? Look at the 
world today ; millions of men ar- 
rayed against each other striving to 
destroy life. Why? Because the 
adversary is whispering to them, 
"This is the thing to do." I want 
to tell you that this war will not 
cease and the strife in this world 
will not end until the children of 
men repent of their sins and turn 
to God and serve him and keep his 
commandments ; and in the words 
of Patrick Henry, "Men may cry 
peace, peace, but there is not peace" 
until the children of men conform 
their lives to the teachings of the 
Father of us all, who gave us our 
being and who placed within our 
reach wholesome advice and coun- 
sel from the creation until now, and 



has said to us, "This is the path, 
walk ye in it." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
surely we will do our duty as elders 
in Israel and as members of the 
fold of Christ. Our Father in 
heaven has given us the knowledge, 
has given us the authority, has 
called us together in the valleys of 
these grand mountains, and has 
given us shepherds after his own 
heart. Let us live as we ought to 
live, let us honor each other as we 
ought to do, let us sustain this Gov- 
ernment that has been so generous 
to us as we ought to sustain it ; and 
if we are not required to give of our 
family, if we have not sons to send, 
then let us give part of our sub- 
stance to comfort the sons of other 
men and to make it possible for ■ 
liberty to be in the world. 

I pray that the blessings of our 
Father may remain with the Latter- 
day Saints, and they will if we will 
be faithful. I pray that our Father 
will bless the man who presides over 
this Church, that he will rebuke the 
weaknesses that the flesh is heir to 
and that have taken possession of 
him, that he will make him well and 
strong and continue to him the joy 
and the satisfaction that he has had 
in ministering to us, all these years. 
I pray that his counselors may be 
similarly remembered and that 
they may rejoice together to pre-- 
side over us and direct us as long 
as they desire to remain with us. 
And may peace and comfort and 
satisfaction be upon all the hosts of 
Israel because of their faith and 
devotion, and may we repent of our 
sins that the Lord may minister to 
us in a greater measure in the fu- 
ture than in the past ; that our sons 
and daughters, growing up under 
our influence, may become a valiant

army prepared, by reason of their 
faith and knowledge, of the power 
of God, to carry his message to the 
nations of the earth and promulgate 
it where it has not been heard be- 
fore, and establish it to the honor 
and glory of God, and to the salva- 
tion of the children of men, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION. 

(President of the Central States 
Mission) 

I esteem it a great privilege, my 
brethren and sisters and friends, to 
have the honor of attending this 
conference. It looked a few days 
ago as if I should not be able to be 
here, but through the prayers of 
faith, I have been permitted to at- 
tend thus far. I have listened with 
interest to the remarks of my 
brethren who have preceded me, 
and was greatly impressed by the 
exhortation and teaching of Pres- 
ident Smith that men and women 
should provide for themselves and 
produce many things that they need 
so that they will not have to buy 
them ; also that they should patron- 
ize home industries. 

In the mission field where I labor 
we encourage the people to grow 
the crops that are necessary to pro- 
duce a living. Our people in the 
south usually grow cotton ; it is the 
cash crop. They have been there 
for many years as renters, and as 
their landlords have generally pre- 
scribed the crop they are to raise, 
they have been forced to raise cot- 
ton, using all the money they could 
get out of that cotton to buy food- 
stuffs for their families and forage 
for their animals, paying high 
prices for it, when they might have 



produced these things themselves. 
But while this custom in the past 
has brought great hardships on 
them it has been a great labor to 
induce them to change their meth- 
od of farming. However, in the 
past year, notwithstanding the 
great drought in the south, hun- 
dreds of people there raised their 
own forage, and have not had to 
buy the hay that has cost so much 
money and kept them so poor. 
They have yielded to the law of 
obedience and they have found that 
therein lies the only safety. That 
has always been my belief. I have 
learned in my experience that to 
obey is better than sacrifice, and to 
hearken than the fat of rams, i 
also believe that the scriptures the 
Lord has revealed unto us in this 
dispensation are more essential for 
us to become acquainted with than 
anything we may think of in tem- 
poral ways. I believe that men and 
women ought to prepare them- 
selves—that they ought to know 
something about the gospel of 
Christ, and why they are members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, or "Mormons," 
as we are commonly called in the 
world. We ought to take advantage 
of opportunities that are offered us 
from time to time to learn more of 
the gospel and to become acquaint- 
ed with the truths contained there- 
in. It is just as necessary for us 
to learn the words of life that will 
bring us spiritual glory and exalta- 
tion as it is to labor hard for tem- 
poral things. We need the tem- 
poral things of life as taught in 
this Church, but we ought not to 
let the spiritual side of life go un- 
developed. I believe that men and 
women can be led and are led too 
much into the ways of money-mak- 
ing and accumulating of means, to 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



43 



the expense, often, of their own 
spiritual welfare. 

We have labored with great in- 
terest in the mission field in the 
Central States, and have seen men 
and women join the Church and 
grow in a knowledge of the Lord 
until they have become happy and 
contented in their lives. Many own 
their homes, as a result of the teach- 
ings of the gospel of Christ. 1 
do not believe, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that a man or woman can ever 
succeed in this world without a 
knowledge of the gospel as well as 
they can with it. There is no real 
happiness, and there is no pleasure, 
there is no unity, aside from it, and 
,as soon as men and women hear of 
the gospel, the majority of them 
are inclined to listen, although they 
do not always obey it. 

I believe that men ought to be- 
come acquainted with the Book of 
Mormon, a book which in itself is 
a direct testimony that this Church 
has something that no "other church 
in the world possesses. If the Book 
of Mormon came into the hands of 
the "Mormon" people through their 
own ingenuity, then men and wom- 
en ought to investigate it and prove 
it. If they prove that it did not, 
then they must acknowledge that 
it is inspired and came from God, 
for it is a direct evidence that the 
Lord has spoken in this dispensa- 
tion. No man can read the Book of 
Mormon with a desire to learn the 
truth and deny the things that are 
in it. No man can read the Book of 
Mormon with a desire to know the 
truth and be honest in his heart 
without becoming convinced that it 
is real and that it does come from 
God. Joseph Smith said that he 
received it from an angel and that 
he translated the records into this 
present book by the gift and power 



of God. I know of no greater evi- 
dence that the Lord has revealed 
himself in this dispensation or in 
the latter days than the Book of 
Mormon. You may take any other 
church, let them offer what they 
have to prove their divinity, and 
there is nothing to be found that 
will compare with this great rec- 
ord. It was given to men in the 
earth to be distributed by the thou- 
sands, for men and women to read. 
It could never have been produced 
by man. Nearly a century has 
passed since this book came forth, 
and there have never been men nor 
a set of men with all their learn- 
ing and with all their power, accu- 
mulated through knowledge re- 
ceived in this world, who have been 
able to produce or write one page 
like unto it. It is the word of God 
handed down to us in this dispen- 
sation, by which we may know that 
he does live, and that he reveals 
himself, that he has the power to 
come and to go as he chooses, and 
that he has a well-defined way and 
plan by which he works. The read- 
ing of the Book of Mormon gives 
unto men and unto women a testi- 
mony that he is and that he really 
does visit the children of men in 
the earth when he sees and finds 
the occasion to do so. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith stated as a boy that 
he received this book from an an- 
gel, and that the Father and the 
Son had visited him. Men may 
criticize the .statement ; men may 
say that Joseph Smith was a dream- 
er. My brethren and sisters, here 
is his work (not entirely all, for he 
left many, many records), here is 
a book '.that has lived all thesie 
years, and no man has ever been 
able to successfully attack the 
words and the principles that are 
contained therein, some of the most 



44

beautiful that a man could read. 
The honest in heart cannot help but 
be touched, and they will surely 
change their method of thinking 
and of believing. 

If a man representing himself as 
a minister of some church should 
come to one of us and say, "Here, 
I desire you to take this book and 
read it, it represents our church, 
and I tell you that it is the truth, 
and if you will pray unto the Lord 
for a knowledge of its truth you 
will have a witness from God that 
it is true," I want to tell you that 
most of us would take such a book 
and read it, and it would stand the 
test if it was the truth. Now, the 
Book of Mormon contains such a 
promise, and such a testimony, and 
when this testimony goes to » any 
man, or when I deliver this book 
unto a man and point out to him 
the scripture and ask him to read 
so that he may know whether it is 
of God, or whether it is of man, 
then I believe that I have done my 
part, and if he is honest in his at- 
tempt to learn the truth and in his 
conviction, the Lord will manifest 
the truth of it unto him by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. I will 
read a few verses from the tenth 
chapter of Moroni : 

Behold I would exhort you that 
when ye shall read these things, if it 
be wisdom in God that ye should 
read them, that ye would remember 
how merciful the Lord hath been unto 
the children of men, from the crea- 
tion of Adam, even down until the 
time that ye shall receive these 
things, and ponder it in your hearts. 

And when ye shall receive these 
things, I would exhort you that ye 
would ask God, the Eternal Father, 
in the name of Christ, if these things 
are not true; and if ye shall ask with 
a sincere heart, with real intent, hav- 
ing faith in Christ, he will manifest 



the truth of it unto you, by the power 
of the Holy Ghost. 

I want to tell- you, my brethren 
and sisters, that that is about all 
the Lord owes a man if he is a 
doubter. When he gives one of his 
sons or one of his daughters a 
chance to read his word which will 
bring them unto him and unto eter- 
'nal life, with such a statement as 
that, if they will humble themselves, 
the spirit of humility will come into 
their hearts and pride and haugh- 
tiness will be banished ; then they 
will know the truth, or they will 
have been sufficiently warned. He 
says further: "Behold the spirit 
of Christ is given unto every man." 
All men have the spirit of Christ 
given unto them, when they come 
into the world, for they are the chil- 
dren of God, God's sons or daugh- 
ters, and they receive his spirit, 
"that they may know good from 
evil; wherefore, I shew unto you 
the way to judge," says Moroni, 
"for everything which inviteth to 
to good and to persuade to believe 
in Christ, is sent forth by the power 
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye 
may know with a perfect knowl- 
edge it is of God. But whatsoever 
thing persuadeth men to do evil, 
and believe not in Christ, and deny 
him, and serve not God, then ye 
may know with a perfect knowl- 
edge it is of the devil, for afttr this 
manner doth the devil work, for he 
persuadeth no man to do good, no, 
not one; neither doth his angels; 
neither do they who subject them- 
selves unto him" ( Moro. 1:16 17). 

Now, the Book of Mormon came 
into the world as a testimony unto 
all peoples, as a testimony for or 
against them, that they would be 
persuaded by the power and Spirit 
of God to know right from wrong, 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON 



45 



to know the truth and to know 
error, and it would be there as a 
witness unto them that God has 
spoken in these the last days. Lat- 
ter-day Saints ought to become 
more acquainted with the Book of 
Mormon. They ought to become 
acquainted with the principles that 
are taught therein. I believe that 
it ought to be read more in the 
home. I believe that it ought to be 
taught in the. schools, for children 
who have been brought up in this 
Church are much stronger if they 
have the privilege of reading or 
having these truths taught unto 
them. 

I endorse with all my heart, the 
Church schools of this Church. I 
believe that they were inspired of 
the Lord, and that the Lord in- 
spired the leaders of this Church 
to continue them, that the children 
of men growing up in this land 
may be brought unto a knowledge 
of their Redeemer, that they may 
know good from evil and that they 
may know the source from which 
good comes and the source from 
which evil comes. 

I pray the Lord to bless Latter- 
day Israel. I pray the Lord to 
bless the leaders of this Church 
and to prolong the life of President 
Smith and his counselors, men who 
have grown old in experience that 
cannot be gained in a day. I be- 
lieve that as a body of men and 
women gathered together here, our 
hearts should ascend in prayer un- 
to the Father for the health of 
these men, that they might be left 
among us ; for that experienced 
men are needed for counsel and for 
knowledge and wisdom has always 
been shown in the history of the 
world. I pray that the Spirit of 
the Lord, may enter into the hearts 
of the Latter-day Saints, that we 



may follow the instructions of the 
leaders of this Church, that we may 
stand together as one, and when we 
do that, we stand behind our great 
Nation in anything that it calls us 
to do, at home or abroad. We ac- 
cept these calls feeling that it is 
our duty; we enjoy them because 
it is a pleasure to do our duty, and 
if we look upon them in the right 
way and live according to the com- 
mandments God has given us, we 
will be saved in the eternal king- 
dom of the Lamb, and we will be 
permitted to come forth in the 
morning of the first resurrection, 
live with our Father in heaven, and 
be regarded as men and women 
who have kept the faith and who 
have believed the testimony of hum- 
ble men. This is, I am sure, the 
desire of all, and I ask that this 
may be our happy lot, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of the California Mission.) 

I solicit your prayers of faith in 
my behalf, my brethren and sisters, 
for if there is any one time in my 
life when I feel my weakness it is 
when addressing a congregation of 
the Saints of Israel, especially if 
this be in the presence of our lead- 
ers — men who have ripened in judg- 
ment and wisdom and rich experi- 
ence. I am not fearful of the world. 
I know we have something new to 
present to them. But when I come 
to you, I feel that you know better 
than I the principles of life and sal- 
vation, and that I should sit at your 
feet and be taught, rather than as- 
sume the position of a teacher. 

I bring to you good greetings 
from the mission field and from 
your sons, your boys who are in the 



4 6 • GENERAL C 

cantonments of the State of Cali- 
fornia. I know how your hearts go 
out to the boys and girls who are 
ambassadors of truth, how you pray 
for them, how you labor to maintain 
them, how your hopes are centered 
in them, and you are looking for 
their return ere long, laden with the 
sheaves of a golden harvest of the 
souls of men. I know, too, that 
your concern for these is not so 
great as it is for the boys who have 
gone as soldiers not only of the 
Cross but of our Country's flag. 
You fear the smile of the wanton, 
the allurements of the world, the 
enticement of vice and sin, more 
than you do the deadly missiles of 
the enemy. I am glad to say that 
so far as we have been able, with 
good men and true, to conserve the 
virtue and the belief of your boys in 
the camps, that we have done a 
good part. They have reciprocated 
it ; they have attended our gather- 
ings ; they have partaken of the sac- 
rament, renewing again their fealty 
to the Cross. They have borne wit- 
ness of the virtue of 'their fathers 
and mothers, and their desire to 
keep unspotted of the world, and 
many times when they have had the 
conduct of our services there has 
never been a dry eye in the assem- 
bly. 

I want to read to you just a little 
from the scripture, for I believe 
that with me you can appreciate it 
more than you ever did before, you 
who have given your sons to the 
service of our country : 

And as Moses lifted up the serpent 
in the wilderness, even so must the 
Son of man be lifted up, that whoso- 
ever believeth in him should not per- 
ish but have eternal life, for God so 
loved the world that he gave his only 
begotten Son, that whosoever believ- 
eth in him should not perish but have 



everlasting life; for God sent not his 
Son into the world to condemn the 
world, but that the world through him 
might be saved. 

I know that it is written by John 
and Paul that Christ was offered 
as a propitiation for our sins. I 
take it, if we had the original text 
we would learn that it was not in 
the sense of appeasing the anger of 
God that he became a propitiatory 
gift. That the Lord may have 
been, and has been, grieved 
and sometimes angry with his 
stubborn people, I grant you, 
but I have never felt that God 
had to be "bought off," if you will 
allow the expression, through the 
death of his Son, from visiting 
upon us condign punishment. No. 
As I understand it, he gave us his 
best loved gift, the First Born 
among' many brethren in the spirit 
world, the only begotten of God in 
the flesh, that we might know him 
and thus in knowing him that we 
might be made free, "for this is life 
eternal, that they might know thee, 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom thou hast sent." He gave us 
the gift of his Son that we should 
be won to him, that we should love 
him, for we give gifts to those 
whom we would win, whom we 
would have love us, whom we would 
draw to us, whom we would bring 
close in our affections, that they 
might be with us and associate with 
us, and share with us our joys and 
good fortune. He gave the Christ 
unto men that they might live again, 
that they might be made free, for 
the truth should make them free in 
their worship, in their power of 
mind, and in their bodies, too, for 
that matter, and the redemption 
wrought out by the Christ makes us 
all alive again in eternity, clothed 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON 



47 



upon with immortality and eternal 
youth. 

Now, Gocl gave his Son to bring 
men to him, his most precious gift, 
to know his mind and will, to be- 
lieve his word. I know not whether 
the mothers of men count the cost 
of bearing sons into the world or 
not, but I do believe that all of you 
have counted the cost of sending 
your sons to the battle front. Whilst 
you know that the voice of God is 
heard in the battle shout as well as 
in the still, small voie, you would, 
if it were possible for you, that this 
cup should pass, and that the lives 
of your sons should be preserved. 
Yet you know that "greater love 
hath no man than this, that a man 
lay down his life for his friends," 
and so many of us have given to 
the world our most precious gifts, 
our sons, that the principle of truth, 
which is the true principle of lib- 
erty, should be enjoyed by all peo- 
ples ; that in knowing the truth they, 
too, might be made free ; that the 
principles enunciated by our fathers, 
inspired of God and written in the 
Constitution of our land, shall go 
forth to govern the peoples of the 
earth, and thus shall "the law go 
forth from Zion," as we are told of 
old. Thus men shall be free to 
worship God according to the dic- 
tates of their own conscience ; men 
shall be free to follow in the pur- 
suit of happiness, so long as they 
shall not intrude upon the rights 
and privileges of others ; and men 
shall be equal before the law ; that 
priestcraft and kingcraft shall cease. 

For the purpose we have given to 
the world our best gift, our loved 
sons, and herein comes the testi- 
mony to me that we are in the ser- 
vice of our God, that we are follow- 
ing in his footsteps, and that we by 



this gift show our love for our fel- 
low men. God, in order that the 
father of the faithful might appre- 
ciate his sacrifice and the love that 
he was showing to man, commanded 
him, Abraham, to take his son of 
promise and offer him a sacrifice, 
after the order of sacrifice instituted 
when Adam was cast out of the gar- 
den of Eden, and this brought home 
to Father Abraham, as nothing else 
perhaps would, the wonderful sac- 
rifice that God would make when 
his beloved Son should be offered 
up, when he should be lifted up in 
order that men might be drawn to 
him. Happily in this instance there 
was a ram caught in the thicket, and 
an angel's hand stayed the arm that 
was about to strike, and the boy was 
delivered. 

I would that I could feel that 
that is a type and a promise to us ; 
that there shall be a ram caught in 
the thicket, that our Doys may be 
•delivered, but I feel that many of 
them will be called upon not only 
to pass through Gethsemane but to 
make the last sacrifice in order that 
men shall be drawn to us. For 
when they do truly know that it is 
not for selfish aggrandizement, not 
for territorial expansion, not for 
selfishness that we wage the war, 
men will be drawn to us, and in the 
baptism of fire and blood that shall 
come to ourselves and them the 
world shall be born anew ; freedom 
shall be established once for all, and 
the neck of the tyrant shall be had 
under the heels of free men, and the 
world shall be made free and Christ 
shall come and reign as King of 
kings and Lord of 1 ords. Then 
there shall be none to hurt nor make 
afraid in all his holy mountain ; 
and the "knowledge of God shall 
cover the earth from the rivers to

the sea," and men shall know him, 
and in knowing him shall love him 
and keep his commandments. This 
reconciles me to my offering of my 
son. This will reconcile you fathers 
and mothers to the offering of your 
sons ; that through them we show 
our love for mankind, our love for 
the principles of truth, and that we 
would reclaim them from their mad- 
ness and establish peace upon the 
earth, that the Son of man himself 
may come to rule and reign, which 
God grant shall be speedily, I ask 
in the name of Christ Jesus. Amen. 

A tenor solo, "O my Father, thou 
that dwellest," was sung by David 
Reese. 

ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK. 

(President of the Western States 
Mission.) 

It is practically inevitable, and 
just as morally certain to all those 
who believe the scripture and have 
followed the swiftly passing and 
tremendously vital events of recent 
months and years which are absorb- 
ing the attention of the whole 
world, that after the titanic struggle 
between the powers of Satan and 
God's power there will be a re- 
alignment of the religions of the 
world. 

Men and women everywhere 
have begun to examine their lives, 
to question themselves and others 
regarding the vital things pertain- 
ing to life. They have become con- 
cerned more of deity than ever be- 
fore. They have come to realize 
and to ask themselves the question, 
what of God our Father and Christ 
our Savior and the hope beyond the 
grave? It is interesting, in connec- 
tion with the situation as we see it, 



when churches are considering 
amalgamation with other churches, 
when different branches of some 
churches are trying to get together 
and join forces on some common 
ground, and when men's hearts are 
torn asunder, to ask ourselves, 
where do we stand in connection 
with these things ? Is there need 
for Latter-day Saints to alter their 
course? Is there need to change 
their fundamental teachings? Is 
there need to join with others in 
seeking to know the truth pertain- 
ing to the history of man, both in 
life and hereafter? We have no 
reason to change our idea as to 
Deity, because that idea has been 
well founded and established in the 
hearts of Latter-day Saints as they 
have become such, following the 
time when the Prophet Joseph said 
that God and his son had appeared 
to him, for we know in our hearts 
through our faith and works that 
God lives. The personal testimony 
has come to his faithful children 
since the organization of his Church 
in latter times, that he does indeed 
live and that his Son is our Re- 
deemer. The minds and hearts of 
men are being turned to God, not 
only because of the serious condi- 
tion in the world, but because men 
who have heretofore written novels 
and light literature have come to 
write pertaining to the more vital 
things of life. 

The most persistent criticism 
came at the beginning of the war, 
or in the first year of the war, when 
members of the church of England 
began to question whether or not 
the church was living up to 
its requirements. Criticism was 
found on every hand for the church 
for a time, and then celebrated 
writers began to elucidate- things 



ELDER JOHN L. HERRICK.

that perhaps were new to these 
people. 

H. G. Wells, the widely read 
novelist, wrote an unusually inter- 
esting book entitled "God the Invis- 
ible King." Sir A. Conan Doyle 
also wrote very pertinently as to re- 
ligion, — all tending I believe to pre- 
pare men's minds to look differently 
than heretofore on the questions re- 
lating to Deity and the hereafter. 
Great religious newspapers began 
to take up the fight, some in defense 
of the church but many of them in- 
timating and admitting that the 
churches as a whole, the so called 
Christian churches utterly failed in 
this crisis of the world's history. 
"The Biblical World," of Chicago, 
not long" ago, in defending the at- 
titude of the ministry declaring that 
Biblical students had taken their 
place in the ranks and had not 
availed- themselves of the right to 
remain out of the war, said that if 
there was one supreme thing that 
the church should heed it was the 
spiritual side of life, and the par- 
ticular sentence I refer to, and the 
closing - sentence of this artcle, 
read : "After the war we shall need 
religion." We need religion during 
the war ; we need it now, when our 
sons are giving up their lives, or 
are prepared to do it, and when our 
daughters are going to the front 
and the very faith of many is being" 
sorely tested, we need religion per- 
haps in a measure among- our 
own people but more especially 
among doubting men and women 
everywhere, that they may acknow- 
ledge that Jesus is the Christ. 
I verily believe that this truth is 
coming to the hearts of men more 
today than ever in the history of 
the world before. In the midst 
of it all it seems to me that every 



forward movement, everything that 
has been done looking to the better- 
ment of nations, of communities or 
of individuals, has all been a vindi- 
cation of the teachings of "Mar- 
monism." 

I said a few moments ago that we 
believe in a living God, in his Son 
Jesus Christ, as a verity. The world 
will come to know and acknow- 
ledge that more than ever before. 
You will remember that in the first 
few months of this awful struggle 
of nations the minds of great men 
were turned to the physical. They 
wondered whether or not men 
would be fit to fight under the then 
present conditions, — they began to 
look for some means of betterment, 
and so they abolished first in Rus- 
sia the use of vodka, then in France 
they followed with a restriction up- 
on the use of absinthe, and soon 
England took the cue and the re- 
straining hand was put upon the use 
of beers. Later on, when they saw 
the almost unheard of benefit that 
came to the soldiers, they began to 
look for another underlying cause 
of weakness. They found that there 
were physical ailments affecting 
whole cantonments, and it was ad- 
mitted in the first year of the war 
that more men had been put out of 
commission because of d : sease than 
from any other cause, and investi- 
gation on a huge and scientific 
scale was begun in order to better 
the moral atmosphere, and they 
have succeeded until the beneficent 
effects have been astounding. To- 
day men are better fit than in any 
year of the war, because they have 
been restrained, and because pro- 
tection has been thrown around 
them, and because they are getting 
different ideals of human expe- 
riences. The Word of Wisdom, if 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they only knew it, has been the 
watchword in many ways. It is true 
they have used tobacco, and will 
probably continue to do it. When 
men use it, if they do so of their 
own free will and pay for it them- 
selves, it is their own business ; but 
there ought to be objection to send- 
ing- tobacco to men, to give it to 
them and entice those who perhaps 
otherwise would not use it to be- 
come users of it. In the midst of it 
all, my brethern and sisters, there 
is one supreme thing that stands 
out, and that is that all of us who 
have anything to do with this 
struggle, either at home or abroad, 
should make individual .sacrifice, 
should be willing to sacrifice from 
•day to day in our appetite, our 
social necessities and in what we 
wear, that we should be constantly 
willing to make a personal appear- 
ance before the world that we are 
right living, and that our example 
here and everywhere should be 
made to conform to those who 
believe firmly that God lives, and 
determine in our hearts to uphold 
and sustain and maintain such be- 
lief. If we do that we have not 
much to fear. The Lord will bless 
our sons and our daughters. He 
may not preserve them all in life, 
but he will bless them, so that the 
example they set before the world 
will teach men and women that we 
know how to live, as well as how 
to die, and our faith and know- 
ledge of the life beyond the 
grave is beyond nearly all else, 
and we can hold that hope out to 
every one and we can ,say to them 
that here is the supreme moment in 
our lives, when we can teach men 
to believe that we live after death 
and receive reward according to in- 
dividual acts. If we follow the ad- 



monition of those who are our lead- 
ers, heed their instruction from 
time to time, listen to the inspiring 
words that come to us from the 
.servants of God, we will be in the 
line of duty. If we are willing to 
sacrifice, if we are willing to live 
the Word of Wisdom, if we are 
willing to teach it by precept and 
example, and if we keep our lives 
unspotted, and if we send our boys 
away free from the sins of the 
world and do our utmost to en- 
courage them in the line of their 
duty, we will have done a splendid 
work. 

May God bless Israel in its noble 
attempt to help the world in its 
struggle for democracy and for 
freedom. May we all have the as- 
sistance of God, that when the su- 
preme time comes in our lives we 
will be ready to make every sacrifice 
that is demanded or required ; aye, 
that we may go farther than that, 
and offer that sacrifice, whatever it 
may be or where best we may serve, 
and may he bless and preserve his 
leaders in Israel, bless our beloved 
America and all who need our peti- 
tion, I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Before the adjournment of this 
meeting I would like to present to 
the Conference one or two items 
which I desire to get an expression 
upon from them prior to the pre- 
sentation of the officers of the 
Church, this afternoon. 

JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR., SUSTAINED AS 
MEMBER CHURCH BOARD OF 
EDUCATION. 

I need not announce here that a 
vacancy was caused in the General 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



51 



Board of Education of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
by the death of President Francis 
M. Lyman. Joseph F. Smith, Jr., 
has been suggested to fill the va- 
cancy in that Board, caused by the 
death of President Lyman. I would 
like an expression of the Saints 
present at this conference as to 
whether they approve of the choice 
or not. All who are in favor will 
please signify it by the uplifted 
hand. If there are any opposed 
they may signify it by the same 
sign. I see no opposition. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN CHOSEN 
TO FILL THE VACANCY IN THE 
COUNCIL OF TWELVE. 

It has been brought again to our 
remembrance that there is a vacancy 
in the Council of the Twelve Apos- 
tles, which should be filled at this 
conference. We have to offer to you 
the name of Richard R. Lyman, a 
son of President Francis M. Lyman, 
to fill the vacancy in the' Council of 
the Twelve. All who are in favor 
of this choice as indicated by the 
Spirit of the Lord to his servants, 
will manifest it by raising their 
right hand. If there be any op- 
posed they may manifest it by the 
same sign. [The vote was unani- 
mous.] 

THE TITHING USED FOR ALL LEGITI- 
MATE CAUSES PERTAINING TO 
THE BUILDING UP OF ZION. 

We feel, as the Trustee-in-Trust 
and President of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
and as the Presiding Council over 
all the Church — the First Presiden- 
cy, in connection with the Council 
of the Twelve Apostles and the Pre- 



siding Bishopric, at liberty to use 
the tithings of the Latter-day Saints 
in all legitimate causes pertaining 
to the building up of Zion. You are 
aware that our special duty and 
obligation is to build up Zion in the 
latter days. This includes the build- 
ing and maintenance of temples, in 
which the ordinances of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ are performed and 
administered for the living and for 
the dead. It is our duty to assist 
the poor and the needy. It is our 
duty to build places of worship for 
the Latter-clay Saints, using such 
portion of the tithings of the people 
that come into our hands as we can 
use agreeable to the amount we 
have to use for the accomplishment 
of these purposes. We may use the 
tithing of the people for the build- 
ing up of settlements — to assist our 
people when they attempt to make 
new settlements, to reclaim the 
desert and to procure water for irri- 
gation purposes, and in this matter 
the Church has been somewhat lib- 
eral. 

It is our duty also to maintain 
schools and seminaries throughout 
the length and breadth of Zion, 
where our children who are in the 
district schools where no religion is 
permitted to be taught, may have 
the privilege of being instructed in 
connection with the secular learning 
that is given to them, those princi- 
ples which are necessary for their 
faith and for their establishment in 
the knowledge of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It is our duty to use 
the means that are committed into 
our hands for the assistance of the 
missions that are appointed and es- 
tablished throughout the nations of 
the world, and in many other ways 
legitimately for the building up of 
Zion and for the spread of the truth, 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the proclamation of the gospel, the 
maintenance of the authorities of 
the priesthood, whose time and 
talent are devoted exclusively to the 
ministry, that they may be fed, not 
luxuriantly, not superabundantly 
but in sufficient measure that they 
may not suffer for the necessaries 
of life. Part of our means is dis- 
tributed to assist the bishops in the 
arduous duties that they have to 
perform, for services that are neces- 
sary in keeping' the records of the 
Church, of the tithing and of other 
records necessary to be kept. All 
these things we esteem as legitimate 
and proper within the sphere of our 
authority and we do not, under such 
circumstances, publicly ask for ap- 
proval of the Church at large for 
sanction in the discharge of our du- 
ties in this regard. 

SPECIAL APPROPRIATION FOR THE 
PURCHASE OF LIBERTY BONDS. 

But when we go apparently out- 
side of these well known and beaten 
paths to use the means of the people 
of the Church, we feel that it is our 
duty to present the cause to them 
and obtain their sanction and ap- 
proval for the use of the means that 
we may think wise to put it to. 

You are well aware that at our 
late conference, by the voice of the 
conference and their approval we 
used $250,000 of the Church tith- 
ings for the purchase of Liberty 
bonds, thus placing that amount of 
means in the hands of our Govern- 
ment for the defense of liberty and 
of freedom that we enjoy to worship 
God according to the dictates of our 
own consciences. 

Now, I have a similar proposal to 
make to this conference this morn- 
ing, that we offer again, or at least 



appropriate the same amount for the 
purchase of more of the bonds of 
the United States. I submit it to 
you and I ask that those who are in 
favor may signify it by the unlifted 
hand, and if there i.s anybody op- 
posed to this, who has a right to 
have a voice in the use of the means 
that he contributes to the Church, 
let him manifest it by the same sign. 
[Out of the 10,000 persons present 
there was not a single neg'ative 
vote.] I believe that the vote is 
unanimous. 

AN AUTHORITATIVE DECLARATION. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is no partisan 
Church. It is not a sect. It is The 
Church of Jcstts Christ of Latter- 
•day Saints. It is the only one today 
existing in the world that can and 
does legitimately bear the name of 
Jesus Christ and his divine author- 
ity. I make this declaration in all 
simplicity and honesty before you 
and before all the world, bitter as 
the truth may seem to those who 
are opposed and who have no rea- 
son for that opposition. It is never- 
theless true and will remain true 
until He who has a right to rule 
among the nations of the earth and 
among the individual children of 
God throughout the world shall 
come and take the reins of govern- 
ment and receive the bride that 
shall be prepared for the coming of 
the Bridegroom. 

Many of our great writers have 
recently been querying and won- 
dering where the divine authority 
exists today to command in the 
name of the Father and of the Son 
and of the Holy Ghost, so that it 
will be in effect and acceptable at 
the throne of the Eternal Father. I 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



53 



will announce here and now, pre- 
sumptuous as it may seem to be to 
those who know not the truth, that 
the divine authority of Almighty 
God, to speak in the name of the 
Father and of the Son, is here in 
the midst of these everlasting" hills, 
in the midst of this intermountain 
region, and it will abide and will 
continue, for God is its source and 
God is the power by which it has 
been maintained against all opposi- 
tion in the world up to the present, 
and by which it will continue to 
progress and grow and increase on 
the earth until it shall cover the 
earth from sea to sea. This is my 
testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, and I have a fulness of joy 
and of satisfaction in being able to 
declare this without regard to or 
fear of all the adversaries of the 
truth. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"O ye mountains high." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Heber Q. Hale, President of the 
Boise, Idaho, stake of Zion, and 
conference adjourned until 2 o'clock 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

At 2 o'clock the conference was 
called to order by President Joseph 
F. Smith, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "High on the mountain 
top." 

The prayer was offered by Presi- 
dent Adolph Merz, of the North 
Sanpete stake of Zion. 

"Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah," was sung by 
the choir and congregation. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH. 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church.) 

Never before in all my life have 
I been so grateful that I am a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus- Christ 
of Latter-day Saints as I am today. 
My heart swells with blessings for 
the faithful in Israel, for the faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints, for God's 
blessings are upon the people of this 
Church. The Lord has blessed the 
leaders of Israel. He has blessed 
the people of Israel who have en- 
tered the fold of Christ. He has 
blessed the Church in all its ramifi- 
cations throughout the world, and 
I pray that he will continue to bless 
the Church and those whom he has 
called to lead and direct its affairs 
upon the earth. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ for 
which we are so grateful contains 
very many simple principles, but 
they are principles of power, and 
I suppose every heart swelled with 
gratitude and emotion when Pres- 
ident Smith in majesty and in power 
declared his testimony, that this is 
the Church. I believe it with all my 
heart, and testify that it is the 
Church of God, the Church of Jesus 
Christ which God honors in the 
earth, for we have seen his power 
made manifest in our ministry and 
in the ministry of His servants, 
many of whom are here before me, 
the presidents of stakes of Zion, the 
bishops of wards, their counselors, 
and their associates, elders in Israel. 
The power of God has been made 
manifest in their ministry, in love, in 
harmony, in the teaching of the 
truth, in the bringing of the bless- 
ings of joy and happiness into the 
lives of many people from many 
lands. I know that the power of 
God is with the elders in Israel, 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who are faithful and true to 
their covenants and privileges. My 
heart is also filled with compassion 
and pity for those who are not 
true and faithful because we dislike 
to ,see. our brethren and our sisters, 
or our friends, who cannot enjoy 
the blessings of happiness that we 
are enjoying, and so our hearts go 
out to the world and to those who 
are not of us, wishing and praying 
that they might enjoy the same 
blessings of comfort and joy and 
peace of heart and soul that we 
are blessed to enjoy. 

There are many people of the 
world, some of them in our midst, 
that when we declare these glorious 
principles of joy and happiness, 
they turn away from them some- 
times very much in disgust, not 
being able to understand them as 
we do, and the words of a poem, 
one of our hymns, frequently comes 
to my mind upon this subject. The 
words are these: 

How foolish to the carnal mind 
The ordinance of God appears! 

Men count it as a puff of wind, 
And greet it with contemptuous 
sneers. 

What! buried now beneath the flood, 
To wash away our guilt and sin? 
Are not some other means as good, 
Nay, better! Why appear so mean? 

Thus they despise the proffered grace, 
And die and perish in their sin; 

So the Assyrian leper thought — 
What! wash in Jordan to be clean? 

And, in a rage, he turned away, 
And would remain a leper still; 

But lo! his humble servant's sway 
Prevailed at last and changed his 
will. 

He washed in Jordan's rolling flood, 
And found the foul disease removed; 
The virtue of the word of God 
Thus by experience Naaman proved! 



Poor sinners now would fain perform 
Some great and meritorious deed; 

Bow to the systems mortals form, 
That from their sins they may 
be freed. 

But why not yield to simple means? 

The Gospel is the power of God; 
'Twill save the vilest from their sins, 

And turn away His chastening rod. 

P. P. Pratt 

There are many who say, "What 
a simple thing it is to go down into 
the water to be baptized," but it is 
the gateway to the kingdom of God 
when performed by proper author- 
ity, and there is no other way for 
us to enter that gate. A simple 
thing to be baptized for another 
that he might live again ! Many of 
us go into the house of the Lord, 
the temples of God, and perform 
this simple ordinance that our 
friends or our kindred dead may 
enter this glorious kingdom as we 
have entered it, they having failed 
to perform that duty here in their 
lifetime, we say "Oh, what a simple 
thing it is," and how little we appre- 
ciate it, yet what a glorions princi- 
ple is back of it. Did you ever see 
anyone who offered a gift to a 
friend or to a loved one but what 
his heart was filled with joy? The 
giver of a good gift is always bless- 
ed with joy. I have witnessed this 
joy upon the faces of my brethren 
and sisters who have performed the 
simple act of going down into the 
water and being baptized by an el- 
der in Israel in behalf of dead kind- 
red or a dead friend. The joy of 
giving a good gift is great, but the 
joy that fills the soul of one doing 
something for someone else who 
could not act for himself is a joy 
beyond measure. 

I suppose all of the people of the 
world who believe in Jesus Christ 
have a faith that he died for us, 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



55 



that he died to make possible the 
resurrection from the dead, a simple 
thing, perhaps, but a wonderful 
thing for us ; and it gives us an ex- 
ample of doing things for others 
which they cannot do for them- 
selves. Had it not been for 
the atonement of Jesus Christ 
there would not have been a 
resurrection. There would have 
been death in the world since 
Adam died; but for the atone- 
ment of Jesus Christ there would 
have been no resurrection from the 
dead. In the atonement of Jesus 
Christ we have the example of the 
glorious principle of doing for oth- 
ers what others cannot do for them- 
selves. The Latter-day Saints are 
blessed with that glorious privilege 
of doing for their loved ones and 
for their kindred dead what they 
did not do for themselves, so that 
the acts of the gospel, these simple 
acts of going down into the water 
and being baptized by a proper au- 
thority, the simple act of laying 
hands upon the sick for their restor- 
ation, the simple act of laying hands 
upon our brethern and our sisters to 
confer the Holy Ghost, they are all 
simple acts, simple ordinances, but 
ordinances of power, which are 
acknowledged both upon earth and 
in heaven. 

I am grateful, my brethren and 
sisters, for these simple truths. I am 
grateful for the blessings of the 
gospel, and for the power of the 
holy priesthood, the authority to act 
in the name of God, to rebuke dis- 
ease, to rebuke the powers of the 
destroyer, and I testify to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that this power 
is in the Church today ; it is the 
power of God to speak and act 
in his name, and in all humility 
I feel and sense the responsibil- 



ity that has come to me to offi- 
ciate in the name of the 
Lord. I pray that I may do so in 
the spirit of wisdom and in the 
spirit of humility. I have received 
many testimonies that the Lord has 
blessed me, that he has given me 
words of inspiration for the com- 
fort, counsel and benefit of his chil- 
dren, and I solicit earnestly your 
faith and prayers to the end that 
the power of God in the earth may 
be used in wisdom and in justice by 
his servants ; and particularly in my 
behalf I do feel that I need your 
faith and prayers, that I may labor 
earnestly and faithfully for the 
progress of the work, and that the 
blessings and counsel given to the 
sons and daughters of Zion may be 
given under the proper inspiration 
and guidance. There have been 
many of our boys received counsel 
and instruction under this influence, 
and they have gone out now to face 
danger in the world. They have 
gone out, many of them, bearing 
the holy priesthood. They have 
confidence in the power that they 
possess, and I testify to you that, 
if those brethren, our boys, will 
honor that priesthood — the power 
of God which has been given them, 
and the promises made unto them 
through that power, they will stand 
under the protection and in the 
favor of God and be honored ser- 
vants in his hands ; for this is God's 
work and it is going forth and will 
triumph in the earth. The proph- 
ecies of his servants are being ful- 
filled hourly and daily before our 
very eyes, and I testify to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that the work 
of the Lord will continue to grow 
in the earth until its mission is fully 
performed. 

May we be true and faithful, may

the blessings of our Father be in 
our homes and be with our sons and 
•daughters, that we may grow daily 
in faith, in repentance, that we may 
have the spirit and practice of 
prayer in our homes, that we may 
honor the priesthood of God as it 
is held by the elders in Israel, the 
different officers throughout the 
Church, may our hearts be filled 
with gratitude that we are members 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and live in this 
day. God's blessings be upon you, 
my brethren and sisters ; and upon 
the presiding authorities through- 
out the Church. I join my brethren 
in praying for God's choicest bless- 
ings to be upon the President of the 
Church, that his body may be made 
equal to his mind, that he may be 
equal to the great responsibilities 
that are upon him. May his asso- 
ciates receive like and similar bless- 
ings according to their needs. May 
the blessings of Israel be upon 
Israel, in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I presume it is known generally 
that the last speaker is the Presid- 
ing Patriarch of the Church, and he 
is beginning to possess the spirit of 
blessing in goodly measure, I am 
happy to say. 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of the Eastern States 
Mission.) 

I esteem this a rare privilege to 
meet with you, my brethren and 
sisters, in this conference, to come 
up to Zion and cast with the Church 
the patriotic vote that has been al- 
ready cast during the previous ses- 
sion of the conference. I wonder 



how long the criticisms will obtain 
as touching the patriotism of the 
Latter-day Saints ! 

In the mission where I am hon- 
ored to labor there are numer- 
ous criticisms being manufac- 
tured of whole cloth, in which 
we are looked upon as being- 
alien enemies with an organiza- 
tion working inimical to the inter- 
ests of this great and glorious gov- 
ernment. I wonder how people can 
believe these things after what has 
been said in this conference ! From 
my earliest childhood I have been 
taught that this Nation has a defin- 
ite and specific mission to perform 
among the nations of the earth, and 
to that end we are pressing forward, 
despite the fact that we sometimes 
become embittered toward each 
other on account of political opin- 
ions. I am still of the opinion that 
God is at the helm, and that this 
Nation is performing its mission 
nobly in sending the law of liberty 
from Zion unto the uttermost part's 
of the earth, and that its mission 
will not have been completed until 
democracy is made safe for the 
world. 

We wonder what steps might be 
taken to put an end to this interne- 
cine war. We wonder how long it 
is going to continue ; and yet in our 
faith in God, we are called upon to 
press forward with sacrifice of life 
and of means in order to liberate 
from the hand of oppression those 
whom we have never seen. God's 
plan of government is that of the 
people, by the people and for the 
people. In the early ages of the 
world, or just immediately previous 
to Christ's coming, monarchies were 
established and with the iron hand 
of rule, not law, men and women 
were ground under the heel of op-

pression. When Jesus of Nazareth 
came, he came with the perfect law 
of liberty, but it was so high, so 
grand, so far beyond the conception 
of man that he who gave the law 
was crucified upon the cross of Cal- 
vary. Continuing on down the ages 
we have the same rule of monarchy, 
absolute monarchies in the world 
with but one church that held its 
subjects under a religio-political re- 
gime to the extent that the one who 
stood at the head of the nation in 
civil affairs declared that he himeslf 
was the head of the church. In the 
sixteenth century the Lord raised 
up men of courage who made one 
long stride toward the liberation of 
mankind, recognizing in a measure 
men's right to think and act for 
themselves. It was quite impossi- 
ble for any one who had been 
brought up under a monarchial 
form of government to institute any 
government different to that with 
which he was most familiar. There- 
fore, in the early reformation the 
churches that grew up patterned 
after the civil form of government 
that then prevailed upon the earth, 
and there was the aristocracy in the 
church as there was the aristocracy 
in civil life. We come down to the 
time when the Constitution of this 
government was framed and writ- 
ten with the pen of inspiration, de- 
signed of God to be the funda- 
mental law of that form of govern- 
ment that should reach out to every 
nation, every kindred, every tongue 
and people. I desire to read to you 
a statement given on December 16, 
1833, in a revelation to Joseph, the 
prophet, whose praises we have al- 
ready sung : 

And again I say unto you, those 
who have been scattered by their ene- . 
mies, it is my will that they should 
continue to importune for redress, and 



redemption, by the hands of those 
who are placed as rulers, and are in 
authority over you, 

According to the laws and consti- 
tution of the people which I have suf- 
fered to be established, and should be 
maintained for the rights and protec- 
tion of all flesh, according to just and 
holy principles. 

Why, I ask, should this Constitu- 
tion be enacted before the restora- 
tion of the gospel? Let the Lord 
answer : 

That every man may act in doc- 
trine and principle pertaining to fu- 
turity, according to the moral agency 
which I hve given unto them, that 
every man may be accountable for his 
own sins in the day of judgment. 

We read from this scripture that 
the Lord was responsible for bring- 
ing about this great and glorious 
instrument known as the Constitu- 
tion of the United States. Strange 
as it might seem, God's purposes 
are worked out, not suddenly, but 
by generations. W e mortals expect 
him to deal in a radical manner by 
hours, or days, or months, or years. 
Such is not his way. Joseph Smith 
was not born under English rule 
upon this land. Sixteen years after 
George Washington had taken the 
oath of offiqe there was born the 
prophet of the Lord in the Green 
Mountain State, Vermont ; and 
when he grew to manhood and was 
commissioned of the Almighty with 
the authority of the priesthood to 
organize his Church, he did not pat- 
tern after the strong and powerful 
nations across the water, but organ- 
ized it after the pattern of that in- 
spired form of government, the 
United States, through which has 
been given unto us as Latter-day 
Saints the greatest .democracy that 
is known in any religious organiza- 
tion upon the face of the earth — 
that organization running parallel in 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



liberality with that of this great na- 
tion. For instance, as the rail splitter 
of Kentucky aspired to and occu- 
pied the chair in the White House, 
so the plow boy became prophet. 
There is no aristocracy in this 
Church except the aristocracy of 
righteousness. There is no aristoc- 
racy in this Government outside of 
the aristocracy of fit and splendid 
citizenship. 

I wonder at what cost this war 
will end, or what expenditure will 
be made in order to bring about 
this liberty and freedom to all men. 
I have here a clipping taken from 
one of the New York papers, giv- 
ing some very interesting data as 
touching the cost of the war. As we 
are about to be called upon indi- 
vidually to subscribe for Liberty 
Loan Bonds, let us forsake some of 
our own pleasures and contribute 
liberally to a cause so worthy, the 
cause for which we are willing to 
suffer, bleed and die to establish and 
maintain upon the earth : 

Washington, March 7. — ■Should the 
war continue until August 1, as it gives 
every promise of doing, the cost to 
the nations involved will reach ap- 
proximately the stago-ering total of 
$160,000,000,000. This is the estimate 
of Representative Frederick C. Hicks 
of New York, who has compiled a 
mass of interesting data on the war in 
response to inquiries from his con- 
stituents as to the resources and 
fighting strength of the nations at war 
and as to the number killed and 
wounded. 

According to the figures of Mr. 
Hicks, 15,116,000 men have been killed, 
seriously wounded, captured, or were 
missing on all sides up to Aug. 1, 
1917. Of these 8,827,000 were on the 
allied side and 6,289,000 on the side of 
the Central Towers. 

The cost of the war to all nations 
was $98,500,000,000, on August 1, 1917. 
To convey an idea of the immensity 
of this outlay, Mr. Hicks figures that 
this amount would construct 257 Pan- 



ama Canals; would build a railroad 
which would encircle the earth at the 
equator fifty-six times; would build 
such a vast number of standard steel 
ships, that, placed bow to stern, they 
would form an unbroken floating 
bridge from New York to Liverpool 
and from New York to Panama; 
would construct 2,042 stone highways 
of standard specifications across the 
United States; would purchase 220,- 
000,000 Ford automobiles— probably 
before the price was raised: or if laid 
out in one dollar bills placed end to 
end would make a chain .of notes that 
would circle the o-lobe 464 times and 
would make forty-eight bands of 
money between the earth and the 
moon. 

That stupendous sum, remarks the 
Representative from New York, rep- 
resents an expenditure of $138,240 for 
every day that has passed since the 
beginning of the Christian era, and, if 
distributed equally among the hordes 
of humanity, would give sixty-six dol- 
lars to every man, woman and child 
upon the world today. It would build 
6,533 National Capitols at Washing- 
ton, and, if it were in one dollar bills, 
would require 621 years to count with 
the operation going forward at the 
rate of five bills a second. 

Making still further comparisons, 
Mr. Hicks directs attention to the 
fact that the cost of the war to last 
August was three times the total de- 
posits ,of all the banks in the United 
States, seven times the annual value 
of our agricultural products and fif- 
teen times the value of our yearly for- 
eign trade. For every month that the 
war continues, he says, an expendi- 
ture will be made greater than that 
made during the entire Russo-Japanese 
war, which lasted eio-hteen months. 
It means that the cost of the Franco- 
Prussian war is being spent every five 
weeks, and that the American civil 
war, which lasted four years, is being 
duplicated in cost every eighty-five 
days. 

History records no other war or 
combination of wars which offers a 
parallel in the expenditure of money 
to the present conflict, asserts Mr. 
Hicks. In fact, the total direct cost 
of the six greatest wars which oc- 
curred in course of 125 years preced- 
ing the present world war was $21,- 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 



59 



000,000,000. One of these six wars 
lasted twenty-one years and another 
four years, yet this sum equals the 
cost of but eight months' fighting at 
the present rate of expenditures. 

The direct cost to the United States 
for the year 1917, is estimated at $6, 
700,000,000, of which amount $3,000,- 
000,000 are loans to the Entente Allies. 
The amount of money appropriated by 
the last Congress for expenditures and 
authorizations was about $18,000,000- 
000, which represents a daily gross 
cost of the war to the United States 
of $49,000,000. 

Disobedience to the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is tremendously expen- 
sive, think you not? 

What a wonderful saving there 
would be in the world if men would 
only heed the gospel of Jesus Christ 
which plants peace in the hearts of 
men ! 

I have here a pamphlet that is 
being distributed widely throughout 
the East, which is the verbatim copy 
of a discourse .delivered by John D. 
Rockefeller, Jr., before the Baptist 
Ministers' Association, in one of 
the prominent hotels in New York 
City. He is picturing the church 
of the future. I am curious to 
know if Mr. Rockefeller hasn't 
overlooked our splendid organiza- 
tion which is a hi.ss and a byword 
on the streets of his own city, and 
the work it is performing. He says : 

Let us picture for a moment what 
this re-born church would be^_ 

It would be called the Church of 
the living God. 

So we are called the Church of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who 
liveth forevermore 

Its terms of admission would be 
love for God, as he is revealed in 
Christ, and his living spirit, and the 
vital translation of this love into a 
Christ-like life. 

Its atmosphere would be one of 
warmth, freedom and joy, so sympa- 



thetically and distinctly manifest as to 
attract and win into its fellowship the 
followers of the religion of the In- 
articulate. 

Further on he says: 

A life, not a creed, would be its test; 
what a man does, not what he pro- 
fesses; what he is, .not what he has. 

Its object would be to promote ap- 
plied religion, not theoretical relio-ion. 
This would involve its sympathetic 
interest in all of the great problems 
of human life; in social and moral 
problems, those of industry and busi- 
ness, the civic and educational prob- 
lems; in all such as touch the life of 
man. 

As its first concern, it would en- 
courage Christian living seven days a 
week, fifty-two weeks in the year, 
rather than speculation about the 
hereafter. 

I wonder, my brethren and sis- 
ters, if he has not read the first sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants 
where God declares, "I, the Lord, 
cannot look upon sin with the least 
•degree of allowance." 

Continuing, he ,says : 

It would be the church of all the 
people, of everyone who is fighting 
sin and trying to establish righteous- 
ness; the church of the rich and the 
poor, the wise and the ignorant, the 
high and the low — a true democracy. 

Its ministers would be trained not 
only in the seminary, but quite as 
much in life, with the supreme em- 
phasis on life. For it would be an 
important part of the preparation of 
each that he should spend months, 
years possibly, working with his hands 
in the fields or the shop, doing busi- 
ness in the store or the office, so thaf 
he might not have merely a laboratory 
acquaintance with the problems ot 
human life, but the practical knowl- 
edge which alone comes from actual 
experience and contact with them. 

Yes, the ministry of this church 
would live in vital touch with hu- 
manity; it would understand and sym- 
pathize with human difficulties, and 
would exert its influence as much in 
livino- as in preaching.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I think it is a most excellent hope 
that John D. Rockefeller, Jr., has, 
and if he would turn his eye West- 
ward he would see that splendid 
organization, that splendid minis- 
try, where men and women are 
called from the various walks of life 
into the ministry, who know how to 
touch human sympathy just as 
Christ was made mortal that he 
might know the needs of mortal 
men and mortal women. 

I bear you my testimony, my 
brethren and .sisters, for it bears 
witness to every fiber of my soul, 
that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that we are engaged in 
a great and mighty work which 
must be performed preparatory to 
the second coming of the Son of 
God, for whose coming we are anx- 
iously waiting. 

God bless you all, God bless all 
Israel, God bless our missionaries, 
God bless those boys who have g'one 
abroad to fight in this great war. I 
want to say for the soldier boys, 
those who are upon the Atlantic sea 
board, that they are impressing the 
people of the East with the sincerity 
of their lives and they are perform- 
ing a wonderful work. There were 
six hundred or more of Utah boys 
brought to the cantonments on 
Long Island ; but instead of being 
allowed to remain together, they 
were used as "chinking" for every 
regiment stationed at those various 
cantonments, and it has appeared 
to me that with the splendid exam- 
ple of these boys, they would preach 
the gospel while they are upon duty 
to a greater number than if they 
were confined to a single regi- 
ment. 

If I might be spared the time, 
President Smith, I would like to 
read one testimonial or two of our 



boys. This letter was written by a 
very prominent person in Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts. The family 
are keeping a Y. M. C. A. division, 
that is, one of the Y. M. C. A.'s in 
which the Navy boys are being 
taken care of ; and they are promi- 
nent to the extent that when Sec- 
retaries McAdoo, Baker or Daniels 
go to Boston they are entertained 
by these estimable people. Two 
young men enlisted in the Navy, 
their homes being in Brigham City. 
I hope their mother is here, because 
this leter was written to her, but a 
printed copy of it came to me in 
New York. I shall read only ex- 
tracts. The woman writing is the 
good wife whose husband has gone 
to France : 

My husband and I loved the boys 
from the first, but as they have lived 
with us they have grown into our 
hearts until now we feel we shall have 
them in spirit for the rest of our lives. 
And we must owe so much of it to you 
two who have made such noble, beau- 
tiful sons, so full of courage, devo- 
tion, highmindedness. You mus:t be 
proud and happy; we are. Lou was 
given the best ship on the list this 
week because of his fine work. * * 
* * * He has grown bio-ger and 
heavier and is a superb looking fellow 
— the dearest combination of a baby 
and a man that I ever saw. He is a 
man in all the essentials of a fine char- 
acter and a dear innocent little boy 
in spirit. Yesterday my Reginald left 
for France for eight months' service 
for the Y. M. C. A. with our troops. 
He said before he went that the only 
good thing the Kaiser ever did was 
to give us our boys, and that he went 
away much happier for having them 
here. Fern will be with me for one 
week more. Certainly wherever he 
goes he will do the most splendid 
things. He is a young crusader, born 
to fight against sin and injustice 
wherever he finds them. He is the 
noblest young fellow T have ever 
known and we both love him with our 
whole hearts. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD.

Now. in conclusion, note the lan- 
guage : 

Dear friends, may I tell you that I 
get much comfort from the firm faith 
that both these children are sent out 
directly from God's hands and are 
very directly and preciously in his 
care. I know that they will be taken 
care of and guided at every step. I 
look ahead for them with the most 
confident heart, but I wish so much 
you could see them. I just cannot ex- 
press my sympathy for you, nor my 
admiration and respect. In looking 
after the boys I keep before me all 
the time the thought that I am doing 
it for you as well as to satisfy my own 
heart. They have filled the place of 
the boys I have lost as I never could 
have believed possible, and my own 
love helps me to understand yours. 

With my warmest greetings and 
sympathy, affectionately yours, Louise 
Daley. 

P. S. — I want to write to you from 
time to time about our children if you 
will let me share them with you that 
way. 

There is the blending, let me tell 
von, of patriotic service to country 
"and fidelity to the gospel. Such are 
the living testimonies our soldier 
and sailor boys bear when they go 
into the country's service. God 
bless us with like testimony and like 
courage, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ballad, was plaved on an English

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

The responsibility which was 
placed upon the shoulders of the 
priesthood of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is a tre- 
mendous one. It now seems greater 
as we look back over the years that 



have passed since the organization 
of this Church, and since that 
priesthood was given. I am just 
beginning to see, in a small way, 
I think, some part of the respon- 
sibility which I, together with my 
brethren and our fathers and grand- 
fathers, have borne, and I am be- 
ginning to feel and understand 
better than I ever have heretofore, 
how significant and how tremen- 
dous was the mission that was given 
to the prophet Joseph Smith. 

It wasn't an easy task, and never 
will be, for the elders of this Church 
to carry the particular message 
which the Lord delivered to them. 
xA good many of us have felt very 
much like Jonah did, who was sent 
to warn Nineveh. . We have trem- 
bled, we have feared to raise up 
our voices on the street corners and 
elsewhere and deliver the message 
of warning. We believe the prom- 
ise made by John has been fulfilled 
when he said;, that in due time 
another angel should fly through 
the midst of heaven, having the 
everlasting gospel to preach to them 
that dwell upon the earth, crying 
with a loud voice, 'Tear God and 
give glory to him, for the hour of 
his judgment is come." We believe 
that the message the angel delivered 
has been committed into the hands 
of the elders of this Church, and 
it has been a message of warning to 
the children of men. 

God our Father knew what was 
coming. We shall not charge him 
with the responsibility of the war 
nor of the distress among the na- 
tions, for as we sow, as nations as 
well as individuals, so shall we reap 
And the Lord knowing what was 
coming, though he were God him- 
self, he could not avert it. The 
natural consequences of sinning

or wrongdoing, men must reap. 
Knowing that he sent this message 
to warn men of that which was to 
come, we have delivered it; but we 
have been filled with fear sometimes 
in delivering it, because we have 
been unwelcome. But we remember 
that those servants of God who 
were given the commission to 
warn men of dangers, and troubles 
that were coming, were never wel- 
come, whether it was John the 
Baptist, who stood before the wick- 
ed king and told him of his sins and 
suffered to lose his head because of 
it, or whether it was the Christ, 
who because he chastised men and 
called them to repentance was des- 
pised and finally put to death. 

It is not an easy thing to meet 
men and- women and tell them they 
are wrong, tell them they are in sin 
and they must repent, for we don't 
get a very glad hand from the ma- 
jority of the people when we tell 
them these things. And so some of 
our missionaries have trembled 
very much and have been very fear- 
ful to meet the people and deliver 
the message which the Lord com- 
mitted into their hands, and yet, 
my brethren and sisters, when I 
look back over the valiant and 
faithful way in which the elders of 
this Church have discharged their 
duty towards the nations of the 
earth, and under the command of 
our Father, I am proud to be an 
elder in this Church and to be affili- 
ated with a band of men who have 
rid their skirts of the blood of this 
generation. From the day that Pres- 
ident Young, President Woodruff 
and others of the earlier brethren, 
left their families and their homes, 
as they were just driven out of 
Missouri, and went on that un- 
known journey across the water 



and suffered much during that 
period, until this time, thousands 
and tens of thousands of the elders 
of this Church have gone without 
purse and without scrip delivering 
this message. Nothing has turned 
them away from their course. 
Whether gold had been discovered 
in California and the whole world 
was afire with desire, the elders of 
the Church have not been deterred 
from the delivery of their message. 
They have acted like men who be- 
lieved they had a real mission. 

How would you feel if you knew 
above this city or any other city 
where you lived there was a great 
dam, and reservoir, containing an 
immense quantity of water and you 
had been given to understand that 
there was danger and that at an 
approximate time that dam would 
break and the lives of the people 
would be in danger, what would 
you do? Sit down or find a place 
of safety yourself and look upon 
the distress that should come? 
No, you would bestir yourself, you 
would go up and down the valley 
or through the streets and warn 
men and women to flee from the 
danger that was to come, and if 
they did not believe you, you who 
knew what was coming, with all 
your heart and soul, you would try 
to impress men and women to 
escape from the calamity that was 
coming. How then should men act 
if they have indeed received a mes- 
sage like the elders of this Church 
have received? 

Recently I have had the oppor- 
tunity to read carefully and ponder 
over the many very wonderful 
things which the Lord has delivered 
to this Church, in the book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants. You do not 
need to hunt out in the world

among' the monks of the past ages 
some supposed prophecy, coming 
from some hidden or obscure 
source. Read the open revelations of 
the Lord, and you will find that 
there everything that we now see 
and witness we were told about dis- 
tinctly many years ago. The warn- 
ing has been given to the nations of 
the earth and they were called upon 
to escape from danger and I say 
that men who had this kind of com- 
mission could not in honesty do 
other than the elders of this Church 
have done: they have acted as if 
they believed what they said. All 
honor to them. 

I want to say to you, brethren 
and sisters, that when the warning 
comes, always from the very be- 
ginning until this time, there has 
been connected with that warning 
the means of escape. God provided 
a means of escape from this war. 
When God restored the everlasting 
gospel through his prophet Joseph 
Smith, he gave the invitation to the 
world, in connection with the warn- 
ing of judgments that were to 
come, the invitation that provided 
the way of escape. It may seem a 
very bold thing for me to stand 
here and say, but yet I say it, for I 
have a living testimony that it is 
true: that if Germany, instead of 
imprisoning the elders we sent her, 
if instead of banishing them she 
had repented of her sins and 
accepted the Lord's invitation, 
Germany would not have plunged 
the world into this war. 

Over in the cantonment, at Amer- 
ican Lake, where all our drafted 
boys from this intermountain coun- 
try first went, we held a conference 
in connection with brother George 
Albert Smith and President Mc- 
Murrin and a great many of those 



boys were present. We heard the 
testimony of brethren who had been 
engaged in the missionary work 
when the war broke out. They 
stood up, six and eight and ten of 
them at a time, eager to bear tes- 
timony — men who were in Ger- 
many, some of them had been ban- 
ished. They saw the mobilization 
of the German army. They had 
been preaching wherever they 
could, warning Germany of the 
dangers that were to come. There 
were men who were in Liege who 
fled before the oncoming Germans. 
There were men in France and all 
those nations, who now stood up in 
the uniforms of the United States. 
They were witnesses that they had 
delivered to those nations the means 
of escape. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I am 
just as anxious as any man that 
lives to see established the princi- 
ples of freedom and liberty for 
which we fight, and I think we 
ought to fight for them. I feel that 
President Smith's words found echo 
in the heart of every true Latter-day 
Saint. With every bone and fibre we 
believe in this country and its insti- 
tutions and we want to see America 
and America's principles succeed, 
but let me say to you, brethren and 
sisters, there shall be something else 
necessary, if we shall find peace on 
earth and good will to men, in ad- 
dition to the establishment of the 
principles of righteousness in politi- 
cal government and freedom ; let me 
tell you that the nations that have 
passed the way of all the earth did 
not come to their destruction be- 
cause their governments were par- 
ticularly bad,but they came to wreck 
and ruin because they were wicked 
and they sinned and broke the law 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of God. The most perfect law of 
political liberty will never save men 
and women except they shall obey 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
in connection with the principles of 
righteousness in political govern- 
ment. I want to say to you that 
while I shall rejoice in seeing the 
standards of liberty and freedom 
carried forward among the nations 
of the earth, I see in that only the 
preparatory way, and there must 
necessarily follow that which is in- 
deed the fundamental of peace, the 
go.spel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I do 
rejoice to know that we have here 
those men who are inspired to tell 
us what we shall do. When the 
nations of the earth do not accept 
the invitation which was given, pro- 
viding the means of escape, then 
they must take the consequences ; 
but I thank the Lord that there are 
in the hearts of the majority of the 
civilized nations of the earth a will- 
ingness to defend the principles 
of righteousness in government. 
Thank God for that, and for their 
stand ; and there is nothing else for 
us to do than to co-operate with 
them in defending the glorious prin- 
ciples of liberty which they have 
espoused and which are ours. O 
how my heart rejoices to know that 
instead of a- little band fighting as 
our forefathers fought for those 
very principles in the establishment 
of this country, we have now allied 
with this the migthy nations of the 
earth; and this is the day of the 
triumph of the truth, when political 
liberty shall come ! 

But O, brethren and sisters, I 
want to say to you that the Lord 
does not love a wicked American 
any better than he loves a wicked 
German. I want to say to you tlfiat 



my heart is touched when I look 
at my America. I love America, 
but I know that my America shall 
not succeed, nor shall she survive, 
except by and through her own 
humility and repentence and turning 
away from sin ! 

I have had the opportunity to talk 
to thousands of boys in the canton- 
ments, and this has been my plea to 
them : You are entitled to the bless- 
ings of the Lord. Your cause is 
just ; and that it shall succeed means 
that you must humble yourselves, 
cease to take the name of God in 
vain, keep yourselves morally clean, 
and you will have a power and a 
strength that no soldiers have ever 
experienced who have gone into the 
battle. 

Brethren and sisters, what shall 
we .do, we who have been called 
here — one of a city and two of a 
family, away from these troubles? 
When the Lord knew that the na- 
tions would not accept the invita- 
tion that was given, he called our 
fathers out from them. What for? 
To save us? Yes, but for some- 
thing else than to save us, just for 
ourselves. He has committed into 
our hands the most precious and 
sacred things in all the world to 
hold the nations of the earth. 

In British Columbia we have a 
conference. We have had soldiers 
go out from that section, you know, 
for three years now, and this is 
what I witnessed : when these boys 
left their homes and got into the 
front of the battle, you know the 
death rate was very high in the be- 
ginning of the struggle. Thev fell 
on the right and on the left and 
when the casualty lists appeared 
each morning there were thousands 
of fathers and mothers who began 
to pray who never prayed before 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH

in their lives. When they learned 
that their boys were prisoners or 
lying wounded in the hospitals, the 
spirit of humility and repentance 
came. In the last year we have had 
an increase in our baptisms in that 
conference. There have been ten 
times as many baptisms in that con- 
ference, in the last year, as we have 
'had in any preceding - year with the 
same number of missionaries. When 
I saw it, I wondered if the same 
good blessings should not, in God's 
providence, come to all this goodly 
land. I see it coming. The by-pro- 
ducts of this war shall be the saving 
of our own blessed America, for 
her salvation, her perpetuity, her be- 
ing favored of God, .depends not 
only upon the money that we put 
up, and upon the boys we send, but 
upon the righteousness of our own 
lives ! 

O my America, humble yourself, 
and turn unto God, your Father, 
and keep his commandments, and he 
will stand by you in the battle for 
right. 

That is my testimony ; and let us 
listen to the voice of these servants 
of God. You do not need to go 
anywhere else, all that the Lord 
wants us to know he will give. I. 
have that confidence. He has in- 
spired these brethren. Let us fol- 
low their leadership, and listen to 
their warning voices. O that more 
of us had believed the message 
which President Young gave us 
concerning home industry and the 
things President Smith has referred 
to. O that we had believed it with 
all our hearts, and practiced it. We 
would have been better. 

We stand in the most favored 
position of the nations of the earth. 
We .shall sit at the first table always, 
but we will share with others. God 



has thus favored us that we stand in 
the best place in all the earth, but 
let us improve that place and that 
opportunity, and let us conserve the 
things that God has given us ; and 
when the war is over and when the 
wounds need healing, behold here 
is the balm that- shall heal the 
wounds of the nations ! God help 
us conserve it, prepare ourselves to 
be ministers in very deed, in the 
calling to which we have been as- 
signed, that we may be faithful and 
not disappoint him, and that we may 
be triumphant in the struggle for 
eternal and everlasting peace, which 
may God grant, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER G. E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of the Northern ^States 
Mission.) 

In the National Congress of De- 
fense, held in the Midnah Temple, 
Chicago, about six weeks ago, I lis- 
tened to one Hammerlin, a peasant 
from Bohemia, who said that he 
came to this country thirty-seven 
years ago. His first work here 
was to drive a mule in a coal mine, 
but, he said, "today I am president 
of the foreign newspapers of Amer- 
ica, and I am occupying this po- 
sition together with the great and 
the educated men of this Nation, in 
the second city in the greatest coun- 
try of the world. What other nation 
under heaven," he continued, "could 
have given me such a glorious op- 
portunity?" 

When I faced this audience, and 
as I sat in my seat and listened to 
the testimonies of those who have 
occupied the pulpit, I have said in 
my heart : What people or what 
organization under (heaven fcould 
give men such a glorious opportu- 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nity as that which we enjoy? One 
of a city and two of a family from 
every nation in the earth, peasant 
and otherwise, have been drawn 
together in this organization and 
have been given opportunities the 
like of which could not have been 
found in any other place in the 
world. 

Continuing, our Bohemian said : 
"My home in Bohemia, which is 
seven hundred years old, had been 
destroyed twice during this great 
war. It was destroyed first by the 
Russians and next by the Germans, 
but I am happy to stand here to- 
day and tell you that no matter if 
it is destroyed and all other homes 
in my beloved native land, the day 
will come when peace shall be es- 
tablished in the earth, and democ- 
racy rule all people; "for," said he, 
in his broken language, "Nick has 
gone and Will vill go." So I say, 
brethren and sisters, if Nick has 
gone, with reference to the Rus- 
sian government, and Will of Ger- 
many will go, so also, in the end, 
Old Nick will go, and truth and 
righteousness will reign in the 
earth. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints has been estab- 
lished in this day that all mankind 
who will hear and obey the voice 
of the Lord might have an equal 
opportunity, but it seems to me, my 
brethren and sisters, that our ex- 
tremity has been God's opportunity 
to bless us and to lead us into the 
straight and narrow way. I am re- 
minded of the struggle with the 
powers of darkness that the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith had in the begin- 
ning when he asked the Lord for 
light and knowledge concerning 
which way he should go ; I am like- 
wise reminded of his asking the 



Father concerning baptism, which 
was answered by the coming of 
John the Baptist, under whose di- 
rection Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery were baptized. Again, 
when divine assistance was needed, 
came the glorious visit of Peter, 
James and John, who bestowed up- 
on them the holy Priesthood and 
the right to officiate in the name of 
the Lord in behalf of all the chil- 
dren of men in the earth. 

From the very beginning of the 
Church, it seems to me that when 
we have gone either as individuals 
or as a Church to our very limit, 
divine Providence has stepped in 
and rendered assistance, until we 
have grown to understand our de- 
pendence upon the Lord and his 
great love and mercy for his chil- 
dren. I am reminded of the time 
when I stood in the road, having 
gone to the limit of my strength in 
searching for the honest in heart 
who would receive me into their 
homes as a messenger of light, my 
eyes were opened, and I bear wit- 
ness that God's promises were ful- 
filled with reference to his mission- 
aries : that he sends his angels be- 
fore their face to bear them up and 
to prepare the hearts of the people 
to receive them. The testimony of 
all the elders in the mission field 
is that when they have gone to their 
limit, and turned to God our Father 
he has never forsaken them, but 
has opened the way, leaving im- 
pressed upon their hearts the testi- 
mony that he is willing to come to 
the assistance of those who dili- 
gently serve him.. So in the his- 
tory of this great Nation — it seems 
to me that man's limit has been 
God's opportunity to come in and 
guide the ship of state. You re- 
member Christopher Columbus, as 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH 67 



he lay bound in the bottom of his 
ship, pleaded with his sailors to go 
on at least three days before they 
should throw him overboard and 
start back to Spain. You remember 
our Pilgrim Fathers were about to 
sail back ' from the rock-bound 
shores of New England, when time- 
ly and needed assistance came. You 
remember, too, Washington at Val- 
ley Forge, his soldiers barefooted, 
his sick men had no medicine, and 
the well had no food, sent his last 
appeal to our ministers in France 
that they must come to his assistance 
now, that anything they would do 
in the future would be unavailing; 
and how this Nation, this experi- 
ment in government, was saved in 
the seeming very last hours by the 
coming of men and money from 
France. Again, the spirit of the 
Lord was upon those who gathered 
to form the constitution of the 
United States that liberty might not 
be banished from the earth, that 
the divine right that God our Fath- 
er gave to his children before the 
world was might be securely estab- 
lished in the last days. 

This Government has grown and 
increased in the earth, in strength, 
in knowledge, in wisdom and in 
toleration for their fellow men. 
Other nations of the earth have 
partaken freely of the spirit of lib- 
erty planted in this goodly land. 
These liberty-loving nations have 
now banded themselves together in 
a mighty struggle to extend and 
perpetuate this sacred heritage. If 
we go to the limit of our ability and 
strength trusting in the Lord we 
cannot fail, for it seems that God 
is using these nations who have 
been the most liberal with respect 
to government, that the rest of the 
world might partake of that which 



we have enjoyed in such a full 
measure ; so in our extreme hour 
heaven will not forsake us. 

As citizens of this great gov- 
ernment, we have not only enjoyed 
the liberties 'that have been im- 
planted in this land of Zion, but as 
Latter-day Saints who have heard 
the gospel we have enjoyed another 
glorious blessing, even the liberty 
and light of truth that has pointed 
the way back in to the presence of 
God our father. From Norway 
and Sweden and Denmark, from 
the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and the countries of Ger- 
many and Holland, and all Chris- 
tian nations of the world we have 
come to this land in response to 
the sound of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ ; and in our coming we have 
sung : 

"O Babylon, O Babylon, 
We bid thee farewell, 

We're going to the mountains 
Of Ephraim to dwell." 

How could a people, no matter 
what the nation, be anything but 
loyal and true who feel, who hold 
such views ? 

In the Northern States mission 
we have today quite a population 
of German people. At the out- 
break of this war they thought I 
was hard on them and their nation 
as to the responsibility for and the 
outcome of this war, but Americans 
of German birth who have accepted 
the gospel should be and are true 
and loyal to this nation, for it is the 
land of Zion to them. About three 
weeks ago, in Milwaukee, during 
my sermon, the whole audience 
breathed amen and amen with a 
spirit of love and devotion to the 
principles of this government and 
to the principles of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ that we have never

felt before. They are beginning 
to reconcile themselves ' to the fact 
that this great war is the chasten- 
ing hand of God upon those who 
have refused the light of the gospel 
and the liberties of mankind. Why, 
I told them that if they had not 
found sufficient reasons in this gov- 
ernment and land of ours to rejoice 
and praise the Lord and be glad 
because they are here, surely in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ they ought 
and find sufficient to make them 
sing praises to the God of heaven. 
Why? Because they had come out 
of the land of oppression in re- 
sponse to the call of light and truth 
and liberty of the gospel. They 
had all received a knowledge from 
the Lord that this is the land of 
Zion, a land of freedom, a land 
choice above all other lands. 

Latter-day Saints in Germany, in 
Holland, in Switzerland, or in any 
other country in the world, no mat- 
ter whether they have ever been 
here or not, feel in their .hearts that 
this is the land of Zion and that 
God has prepared this nation in or- 
der that he might establish his king- 
dom in the earth, and gather the 
honest in heart from all nations. 
The members of this Church now 
living in Germany ought to feel in 
their hearts a spirit of loyalty and 
fidelity to this nation because they 
have been taught that it has been 
established by God. Even though 
they may be numbered soldiers in 
Germany, fighting under the mar- 
shaled power of their Kaiser, yet I 
feel sure their hearts beat in sym- 
pathy for the land of Zion. With 
my brethren before me, I feel that 
God our father is at the helm, and 
while this may be a dark hour in 
our history, the Lord will come to 
our rescue in the end. Will will 



follow Nick, and after Nick and 
Will and all others who have 
usurped the right of man to be free 
and govern himself, then also the 
old Nick himself will go. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in my testimony of this gospel. 
I rejoice to bear witness to you 
that I know that God our Father 
lives. I know that he does send his 
messengers before the face of the 
missionaries and lead them to the 
doors of the honest in heart, and in 
the way of those who are prepared 
to receive them. I am sure that 
he will go before the face of all 
the sons of the Allied nations of the 
world and grant that victory may 
perch upon their banners. While 
we may be scourged and while we 
may be called upon to offer a sacri- 
fice for these great and glorious 
blessings we are seeking, neverthe- 
less in the end and in our extrem- 
ity victory shall be ours. 

Some of your sons in Camp 
Dodge, Iowa, and in Camp Grant, 
Illinois, and in one or two other 
camps I have visited, have said to 
me: Brother Ellsworth, I feel, O 
so lonesome. I would sooner be a 
private with the Utah boys than an 
officer here alone, away from my 
people. I have said to them inva- 
riably : "My good brethren, it may 
be a little lonesome, but I feel ab- 
solutely sure that it is better that 
you should be here alone as an offi- 
cer or even as a private, providing 
you will live your religion and set 
the example which you should set 
before your fellow men; for you 
have been called, and the majority 
of you have been ordained of God 
that you might minister in the 
things of our Father in heaven. I 
am sure that the way will be open- 
ed for you not only "to be a soldier 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



69 



but to be a comfort to your com- 
rades. The way will be opened for 
you to strengthen them and to offer 
courage to them, and in the end, 
when peace shall be established, 
what a wonderful opening there 
will ibe for the soldiers from among 
the Latter-day Saints to go to the 
soldiers of every state and every 
city in this glorious land of ours. 
You will not find a man among the 
soldiers of Illinois who will ever 
permit any one to say anything 
against Utah or the Latter-day 
Saints, if they have fought side by 
side or under the leadership of a 
'Mormon' officer. What is true 
of Illinois may be true of every 
other state in this union, and every 
country in the world ; for after this 
great war it shall not be : I am a 
citizen of this state or that state or 
the other state, but I am a citizen 
of America or a citizen of the 
world." So, I feel that though it 
may be a lonesome, time for some 
of our boys, yet if they live their 
religion, if they keep the command- 
ments of God and keep themselves 
clean and unspotted from the world 
and offer themselves as a willing 
sacrifice, it shall be as the leaven 
sent out into the world to leaven 
the lump. Our missionaries who 
are now preaching the gospel 
breathe the spirit of war, and some- 
times breathe a desire to go out 
and fight that peace might be hast- 
ened in the earth. They are given 
five days in which to report for mil- 
itary service after finishing in the 
mission field. Some have even re- 
ported a month before being re- 
leased in order to be ready for a 
service that must be that the gospel 
principles might be spread abroad. 

The Lord bless our leaders, and 
may God our Father touch our 
Prophet with his finger, as it were, 



and heal him from his infirmities ; 
that we may hear his glorious voice 
and his powerful testimony yet 
many years. When I heard that 
he was not well it seemed to me 
that my very own had been strick- 
en. So I pray, with all Zion, that 
God will bless him ; that he will 
bless us all ; that we may keep 
clean and pure and do our full part 
that we may be worthy of the glor- 
ious opportunities that our Church 
and our Nation afford, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the Tab- 
ernacle, Sunday, April 7, 1918, 10 
o'clock a. m., President Joseph F. 
Smith, presiding'. 

The great assembly \yas called to 
order by President Joseph F. Smith 
who gave notice of the holding of 
an overflow meeting in the Assem- 
bly Hall, with Elder Joseph W. Mc- 
Murrin, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty, presiding; and an open air 
meeting near the Bureau of Infor- 
mation, the weather permitting, 
with Elder Rulon S. Wells, of the 
First Council of Seventy, presiding. 
Both these meetings were necessary 
to accommodate people who could 
not find room in the overcrowded 
Tabernacle where every seat and all 
available standing room was occu- 
pied. 

The hymn, "Hail to the bright- 
ness of Zion's glad morning," was 
sung by the choir and congregation. 

Prayer was offered by President 
1 Alonzo A. Hinckley, of the Deseret 
stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the hymn : 
"Though in the outward church be- 
low." 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

Why the Gospel is preached — A gath- 
ering dispensation — The world's op- 
position — God will not be thwarted 
— The parable of the Feast — A com- 
pelling situation — Testimonies, then 
judgments — The Great War — Amer- 
ica and her Allies preparing the way 
for the spread of truth and freedom. 

"Is true freedom but to break 
Fetters for our own dear sake, 
And, with leathern hearts, forget 
That we owe mankind a debt? 



No! true freedom is to share 
All the chains our brothers wear, 
Arid, With heart and hand, to be 
Earnest to -make others tree! 

"They are slaves who fear to speak 
For the fallen. and the weak; 
They are slaves who will not choose 
Hatred, scoffing and abuse, 
Rather than in silence shrink 
From the truth they needs must think; 
They are slaves who dare not be 
Tn the right with two or three." 

"Then to side with Truth is noble 

when we share her wretched crust, 
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, 

and 'tis prosperous to be just; 
Then it is the brave man chooses, 

while the coward stands aside, 
Doubting in his abject spirit, till his 

Lord is crucified, 
And the multitude make virtue of the 

faith they had denied." 

I have quoted these lines of the 
poet in order to create an atmos- 
phere for some reflections that have 
been running through my mind 
since the beginning of this confer- 
ence ; and perhaps I can best ap- 
proach my subject proper by relat- 
ing two little incidents of my per- 
sonal experience. 

Not long ago I stood beside the 
bier of an aged woman, a Latter- 
day Saint, speaking at her funeral. 
One of the brethren then present 
had read to the congregation a 
sketch of this good woman's life. 
She was as old as the Church itself, 
lacking two months, and was born, 
if I remember aright, in far away 
Gloucestershire, England. At nine- 
teen she heard the gospel preached 
by an elder of the Church, and her

.sympathy was at once enlisted. She 
believed the message that he 
brought and straightway offered 
herself for baptism. Her family 
were much opposed to this step, and 
it was over the protest of her father 
and mother, brothers and sisters 
that she espoused the unpopular 
cause, the religion of a people hated 
the world over. So intense was the 
prejudice that she had to leave home 
and support herself by the labor of 
her hands ; but she had the courage 
of her convictions and her faith did 
not fail. Ten years later she emi- 
grated to America and came on to 
the Rocky Mountains, but not be- 
fore her heroic example had had its 
effect upon those around her.* Her 
parents, brothers and sisters had all 
followed her into the Church. She 
had become the- savior of her 
father's house ; this little slip of a 
•girl aged only nineteen. 

I contrast this with another inci- 
dent, one that happened many years 
ago when I was a young mission- 
ary in the State of Ohio. In the 
city of Cleveland I formed the ac- 
quaintance of a very estimable lady, 
the widow of a Union officer who 
had fallen in battle. She loved her 
dead husband devotedly; she re- 
vered his memory, and was much 
taken up with the doctrines that I 
presented to her, particularly those 
pertaining to salvation for the dead 
and to eternal marriage, both in 
person and by proxy, marriage for 
all eternity. She said, "Do you 
mean to tell me that if I become a 
Latter-day Saint I can be sealed to 
my departed husband and be his 
wife hereafter?" I replied, "I do 
mean that very thing, for it is the 
truth." She exclaimed almost in 
rapture, "I never heard anything so 
beautiful; and if you will convince 



me that it is indeed true, I will be 
baptized if it be in a lake of living 
fire." I answered, "I cannot con- 
vince you, 1) am only a bearer of 
God's message. But he can con- 
vince you as he has convinced me, 
and I will make you this promise: 
If you will humble yourself and 
ask the Lord, he will grant you a 
testimony that that is a true prin- 
ciple." She said, "I will ask him." 

Not long afterward she wrote in- 
forming me that God had answered 
her prayer, and that she was ready 
to be baptized. I was overjoyed. 
There is no joy that can compare 
with that of a missionary who has 
been made the instrument for the 
salvation of a soul. I wrote at 
once that I would make up a little 
party and meet her at a certain 
point on the shore of Lake Erie, 
there to baptize her; and I was 
about to start for the place appoint- 
ed when I received another note 
from her, reading something like 
this : "I did not dream that I was 
such a poor, weak, frail creature 
as I am. I believe what you have 
told me, I feel that it is true, and I 
thought myself strong enough to 
take this step; but I am not. I 
haven't the stamina, the strength to 
endure what would follow. Why, 
if I should become a 'Mormon' I 
would be hated by the people who 
now love me, my friends would turn 
away from me, my name would be 
cast out as evil; I would lose my 
social standing. I cannot do it. I 
• hope the day will come when I 
shall have the necessary strength, 
but I don't possess it today. 

These are some of the experiences 
that attend the preaching of the 
gospel in this dispensation — a dis- 
pensation destined to gather into 
its capacious bosom all the dispen-

sat ions of the past, and which rep- 
resents the winding up scene of 
God's great work pertaining to the 
salvation of man upon this planet. 
The dominant thought in the mind 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith during 
his last days on earth was expressed 
by him in the following forceful 
language : 

"It is necessary, in the ushering 
in of the .dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times, that a whole and com- 
plete and perfect union and welding 
together of dispensations and keys 
and powers and glories should take 
place and be revealed from the days 
of Adam even to the present time ; 
and not only this, but those things 
which never have been revealed 
from the foundation of the world, 
but have been kept hid from the 
wise and prudent, shall be revealed 
unto babes and sucklings in this 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
time." Paul the apostle also re- 
ferred to this great and final period 
as one in which God would gather 
together all things in Christ, both 
in heaven and upon earth. 

Involved in this mighty scheme 
of bringing together all things that 
are Christ's, is the gathering of the 
scattered house of Israel, the chil- 
dren of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, 
the chosen people, through whom 
God has worked from the beginning 
for the salvation and betterment of 
mankind ; and Joseph Smith, a de- 
scendant of that Joseph who was 
sold into Egypt, was the divinely 
appointed instrument for lifting up 
the ensign for the gathering of 
Israel in the last days. 

And what is the object in view? 
Why all this stupendous labor and 
sacrifice? Why must the house of 
Tsrael be assembled? Why must 
the gospel dispensations — 'links of a 



mighty chain extending from the 
creation down to the end of time — 
be bound together in one ? It is be- 
cause God is coming down upon the 
earth, and the way must be pre- 
pared before him. Jesus Christ is 
coming to reign as King of kings, 
to inaugurate the millennial era of 
universal freedom, righteousness 
and peace ; and in order that his 
coming, which is designed as a 
blessing, may not prove a curse, a 
calamity, through the unprepared- 
ness of his people and the world at 
large, he has set his hand in these 
days to perform the marvelous 
work and wonder that the Prophet 
Isaiah foretold. Israel must be 
gathered because this God who is 
coming is the God of Israel, and no 
other people have the right to re- 
ceive him. He will come to his own 
as he came anciently, but his own 
• will not reject him as they did be'- 
fore. Neither will he come again 
as a lamb led to the slaughter ; he 
will come as the Lion of the tribe 
of Judah, to sit upon the throne of 
David and reign for a thousand 
years, sanctifying the earth and 
preparing it for future glory, when 
it will become a heaven, a celestial 
abode for the righteous. God raised 
up Joseph Smith and revealed to 
him anew the everlasting gospel, 
and conferred upon him the powers 
of the eternal Priesthood, that he 
might lift up the ensign as a rally- 
ing center for the tribes of Israel, 
that a people might be ready to re- 
ceive the Lord when he comes. And 
for upwards of eighty years this 
has been the message proclaimed by 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

One would suppose, looking at 
things naturally, that the world 
would welcome such a message : 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



75 



that they would rejoice at being- 
told these glad tidings. Think of it ! 
That same Jesus who ascended into 
heaven two thousand years ago, is 
coming again to bless the earth 
with his divine presence ! The 
world ought to be glad of it, and 
love to be told of it. But it is not 
so. They do not believe it. They 
think we are deluded, and that we 
are trying to deceive them. They 
regard these things as the vapor- 
ings of minds frenzied by fanati- 
cism. But we have a testimony by 
the Holy Spirit that they are true. 

"He that scattered Israel will 
gather him and keep him as a shep- 
herd .doth his flock." This is the 
message of "Mormonism." But 
when our elders go forth to pro- 
claim it they meet with all sorts of 
experiences, all kinds of opposi- 
tion. The laws of men are in con- 
flict with the laws of God ; their 
traditions and superstitions are op- 
posed to divine revelation. Indif- 
ference, prejudice, selfishness, jeal- 
ousy, passion, pride, wealth, poli- 
tics, religion, all are in the way of 
the spread of truth and the accom- 
plishment of God's sublime pur- 
pose. A few receive the gospel 
gladly ; some believe it, but are 
afraid to obey it, because of the 
sacrifices entailed ; while the great 
mass ignore the saving message, or 
array themselves against it, sit in 
judgment upon it, imprison or ban- 
ish or put to death the messengers, 
and stand in the way of the prog- 
ress of God's work, which has as 
its one object the happiness and 
salvation of the race. 

What is the Lord going to do 
about it? Will he allow himself to 
be thwarted? No. He has set his 
hand to do a certain work, and that 
work will be done, though all man's 



works go to pieces in the process. 
The Savior, in one of his parables, 
(Luke 14:15-24) indicates the 
means that will be used to induce 
men to receive the gospel and "eat 
bread" in the kingdom of heaven. 
"A certain man made a great sup- 
per and bade many, and sent his 
servant at supper time to say to 
them that were bidden, Come for 
all things are now ready." I shall 
modernize the language a little, but 
this is the substance : One of those 
invited said, "I cannot come, for I 
have bought a piece of ground and 
must needs go and see it;" another 
excused himself by saying, "I have 
bought five yoke of oxen and must 
prove them ;" and a third entered 
this plea, "I have married a wife 
and therefore I cannot come." The 
Master of the house was angry at 
these excuses, and said to his ser- 
vant, "Go out quickly into the 
streets and lanes of the city and 
bring in hither the poor, the maim- 
ed, the halt and the blind." This 
was done, and the poor gladly 
flocked to the feast : they had no 
social standing, no wealth, no poli- 
tics, no material or other interests 
to hold them back, to keep them 
from accepting the invitation. They 
came, but still there was room. The 
Lord then . uttered a very strange 
command. Said he to his servant, 
"Go now into the highways and 
hedges and compel them to come 
in, that my house may be filled." 

I know what your thoughts are. 
You are wondering, Is it possible 
that God will compel men to be 
saved ? No. Compulsion is the doc- 
trine of Lucifer; it is the doctrine 
of the German Kaiser, who stands 
upon the devil's ground, compel- 
ling men to do his bidding. The 
doctrine of Jesus Christ is free- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dom, free agency, the right of 
choice. He is the God of freedom, 
his gospel is "the perfect law of 
liberty ;" he is the God of this land, 
the land of liberty, and the only 
King who will ever rule over it. 
You need not fear that any German 
kaiser will ever set up his throne 
upon this land. Read the Book of 
Mormon and be convinced. 

But you are wondering what the 
Lord of the Feast meant when he 
sent his servant to "compel them to 
come in." I believe this to be the 
solution : God will never coerce- the 
human mind — never fetter the hu- 
man will. He will force no man 
into heaven ; no man into hell. But 
he has never said that he would not 
create compelling situations, and so 
.shape human affairs as to induce 
men and women to do things of 
their own volition that they would 
not do if circumstances remained 
unchanged. 

Let me illustrate with another in- 
cident of my experience. When I 
was a little boy I used to study my 
spelling lesson out of an old blue 
book, "Webster's Spelling Book." 
Some of you gray-haired men may 
have done the same. None of the 
sisters, of course, will think back 
that far (Laughter). In that old 
book were several rude. wood cuts, 
one. of them representing a farmer 
holding an altercation with a bad 
boy up in an apple tree. The boy 
was doing wrong — taking the 
farmer's fruit without permission. 
In a gentle persuasive voice the 
owner of the tree asked the thiev- 
ing urchin to come down, but he 
only laughed ; he was satisfied with 
things as they were ; he wanted to 
stay there and enjoy himself, and 
he politely declined the invitation 
to descend. The farmer then grew 



more serious. Putting on a stern 
manner, he took up some grass or 
turf and threw it at the boy, sharply 
demanding that he come down. But 
a little grass did not hurt him ; he 
only laughed and jeered the more. 
Then the farmer became terribly in 
earnest. Picking up some rocks he 
gave that boy a good pelting, and 
clown he scrambled in a hurry — of 
his own accord (Laughter). His 
mind, you see, had remained unfet- 
tered ; he had his free agency ; he 
could have .stayed up there indefin- 
itely had he wanted . to ; but for 
some reason he did not want to 
(Laughter). His mind had changed, 
and he came down of his own sweet 
will. That is my idea of a com- 
pelling situation. 

God is not going to be thwarted. 
The Creator will not be baffled by 
the creature. Having set his hand 
for the gathering of his elect, he 
will break down every barrier to 
the spread of truth and the deliver- 
ance of the house of Israel. He has 
sprinkled many nations with the 
blood of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, 
the blood that believes, and has sent 
into those nations spirits answer- 
ing to that blood. As a result, when 
the gospel goes forth and the chil- 
dren of Israel are commanded to 
gather, faith is found among all 
peoples and the progress of God's 
work is thereby facilitated. Like 
the rain-showers from heaven over 
the parched and thirsty soil, this 
choice blood, having accomplished 
its object, having made the world — 
the unbelieving, spiritually barren 
world — 'fruitful 'of good things, is 
summoned back to the ocean of its 
origin. This is the significance, the 
symbolism of the scattering and 
gathering of Israel. 

After testimony will come judg-

ments — stern measures, if the mild 
ones prove ineffectual. In Decem- 
ber, 1832, Joseph Smith prophesied 
that war would be "poured out upon 
all nations," and that famine and 
other plagues would follow. Dur- 
ing the same month God command- 
ed the elders of the Church to go 
forth and sound the gospel warn- 
ing. Every man warned was to 
warn his neighbor, and this was the 
substance of the divine declaration : 
"After your testimony cometh the 
testimony of earthquakes that shall 
cause groanings in the midst of 
her;" the voice of tempests, the 
voice of thunderings and of light- 
nings, the voice of the waves of the 
sea heaving themselves beyond their 
bounds. The sun .shall be darkened, 
the moon shall be turned to blood, 
the stars fall from Heaven like figs 
from off a fig tree. Earth shall 
reel to and fro like a drunken man ; 
all things shall be in commotion ; 
men's hearts shall fail them for 
fear, and they shall fall upon the 
ground and not be able to stand. 

There's the program — the pro- 
phetic program marked out for the 
consideration of those who stand in 
the way of Omnipotence, lifting up 
their puny arms to prevent God's 
people from carrying out his com- 
mand to prepare the way before his 
glorious coming. 

Oh, how thankful I am that our 
nation, our beloved America, is 
standing where she ought always 
to stand, and doubtless always will 
— standing for freedom and the 
rights of man, imperiled by the 
selfish ambition of a bloodthirsty 
tyrant bent upon dominating the 
world ; that she is standing for 
those principles of liberty and 
equalitv which are a part and por- 
tion of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 



This gospel must make its way into 
every nook and corner of the 
world, and woe be to that nation 
that tries to prevent. I want my 
boy, who has enlisted in the cause 
of our country, to feel — not that 
he is a martyr — I want him to feel 
that he is a soldier of Jesus Christ, 
and that upon him devolves in part 
the duty of spreading a knowledge 
of these principles, the principles of 
truth and freedom. The fetters of 
tyranny were not stricken from 
America for the sake of Americans 
alone. God loves the whole world ; 
he gave his Son to save it ; he is 
using America and her allies as in- 
struments for the spread of the 
Gospel of Liberty, and in their 
wake, after they have cleared the 
way, will follow the missionaries 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY. 

The reality of Christ — Testimony of 
Peter and Paul and of Joseph Smith 
— What a change, af all the world 
would accept the teachings of Christ 
and his actual divine personality as 
the Son of God — The Latter-day 
Saints do so — Testimony of some of 
our boys who have gone to estab- 
lish liberty in the world — An ex- 
ample — Individuals and nations 
must accept the truth that Jesus 
Christ is in reality the Son of God 
and be guided by his principles of 
everlasting truth and justice— The 
war a preparation for the spreading 
of the true plan of salvation. 

I sincerely hope and pray that I 
may be able to express whatever the 
Lord desires me to say this morn- 
ing. If ever there was a time in 
my life when I needed his guidance 
and his support it is at this moment. 

I feel it an honor to be associated 
with men and women who believe in 
the reality of Christ, our Redeemer.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I should like to express what I mean 
by that, and so shall call attention 
to two incidents in scripture — one, 
the experience of two of the ancient 
apostles, and the other the testimony 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The 
apostles one day after the death and 
resurrection of their Lord were 
preaching in the temple, and the 
Sadducees and officers came and 
arrested them, and put them in pris- 
on. The next day Peter and John 
were brought before the high priest, 
before Annas and before Caiphas, 
some of the very men who had been 
the means of crucifying the Lord. 
"And when they had set them in 
their midst they asked," (referring 
to the miracle which Peter and John 
had performed the day before by 
healing the impotent man at the 
gate,) "By what power or by what 
name have ye done this? Then 
Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, 
said unto them : Ye rulers of the 
people and elders of Israel, if we 
this day he examined of the good 
deed done to the impotent man, by 
what means he was made whole, be 
it known unto all and to all the peo- 
ple of Israel, that by the name of 
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye 
crucified, whom God raised from 
the dead, even by him doth this man 
stand before you whole. This is the 
stone which was set at naught of 
you builders, which has become the 
head of the corner." And then, 
"neither is there salvation in any 
ofher, for there is none other name 
under heaven given among men, 
•whereby ive must be saved!" 

To Peter and to John on that oc- 
casion Christ, the Redeemer, was a 
reality. They had associated with 
him in the flesh, they had sat in his 
company, they had seen his mira- 
cles, they had listened to his .divine 



teachings, they had stood by, John 
at least, when the Master was nailed 
to the cross. They had associated 
with him for approximately forty 
days after his resurrection from the 
tomb. And now clothed with the 
power which the Lord had given 
them they faced the very men who 
had crucified their Redeemer and 
said : "By him whom thou didst 
crucify is this man made whole." 
To them, Jesus was not an imag- 
inary being; his life was not an 
idealism nor a mere mental concep- 
tion. Christ, I repeat, was a reality. 
He was indeed the very Son of God, 
the divine Redeemer of the world. 

Now listen to another testimony 
and this within the age of few of 
the men — I wish there were many — 
who are here assembled today : 
"When the light rested upon me I 
saw two personages whose bright- 
ness and glory defy all description, 
standing above me in the air, one of 
them speaking unto me, called me 
by name and said, pointing to the 
other: 'This is my beloved Son, 
hear him !' " The Prophet Joseph's 
object in going to the Lord on that 
occasion was to inquire of him 
which of all the sects professing to 
be followers of the Redeemer was 
right. This then was his answer: 
"I was answered that I must join 
none of them for they were all 
wrong. And the personage who 
addressed me sai.d : that all their 
creeds were an abomination in his 
sight, that those professors were 
all corrupt, that they draw near to 
me with their lips, but their hearts 
are far from me. They teach for 
doctrine the commandments of 
men, having a form of godliness, 
but they deny the power thereof." 

To him who accepts Jesus of 
Nazareth as the very Son of God, 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



to him who believes with all his soul 
that Jesus lives today, that he can 
influence and that he does influence 
the world, to him, I say, who accepts 
that truth, Christ's teachings as well 
as his personality, become a reality. 
You can not profess to be truly a 
Christian and refuse to live up to 
the principles that Christ taught and 
obeyed. 

Now, why do we honor him to- 
day? Why does the world profess 
to honor him? First because he is 
the Son of God ; and second because 
he was an ideal man. They accept 
him as one who was sinless before 
God, an exemplar to all the world. 
Then those who follow him should 
possess, at least strive every day 
of their lives to possess, those same 
characteristics, and approach, at 
least as near as weakness of mor- 
tality will permit, some of those 
qualities manifest by their Lord. 
Regarding the universality of the 
acceptance of Jesus Christ as the 
Redeemer, I read recently, in an ex- 
cellent work in many respects, this 
statement: "The printing presses 
on both sides of the sea are flooding 
the world with books about the life 
and times of Jesus, and the result 
is he looms colossal before the eye's 
of the world. It is not simply the 
church that sees him. All men can 
see him now. He has broken out of 
ecclesiastical circles ; he walks 
through all the cities and lands." 

O, if only that were true ! If only 
that were true ! What a different 
world we should have today from 
what it is ! Do you think that if 
men everywhere ,saw Christ as the 
Prophet Joseph saw him — 'I do not 
mean physically now as he alone 
saw him, but if they will accept 
him as the Prophet Joseph has re- 
vealed him, having seen him, if they 



will accept him as John saw. him 
and accepted him when he hurled 
into the face of Annas and Caiphas, 
the truth that "By his power whom 
thou didst crucify is this man made 
whole" — do you think that you 
would find in Christian communi- 
ties the brothel ? Do you think that 
you would find other allurements 
that entrap the feet of the young 
and lead them from Christ? I ask 
you if the Christian who professed 
to be a Christian in reality believed 
in the doctrines and the teaching of 
the Redeemer as he gave them, 
should we have today the carnage, 
the bloodshed, the infamy that is 
now depopulating the Christian na- 
tions? I do not, I do not. 

I will tell you what I am inclined 
to think: That many who profess 
Christianity are accepting Christ as 
an ethereal being, and are inclined 
to look upon his teachings as im- 
practical. They do not fully realize 
that before the zvorld can be saved 
they must accept his teachings, they 
must walk in his paths as individ- 
uals and as nations, they must ac- 
cept as a veritable truth his saying: 
"I am the light of the world." 

As individuals we should emulate 
him, then, because of his divine 
character. The professing Christians 
do not honor him, even with the 
honor they give him, because he 
was a great poet, because he was a 
great scientist, because he was a 
great discoverer, a great inventor 
or great statesmen or a great gen- 
eral. They honor him because he 
was a great man. In the realm of 
character he was supreme. In ad- 
dition to all that. Latter-day Saints 
revere him because he was in reality 
the Son of God, the Redeemer of 
the world. In thus accepting him 
we, as inviduals, must emulate his 



80

divine character, approach it as 
nearly as we can by keeping our- 
selves celan and unspotted from the 
sins of the world. 

I said I rejoice in associating 
with men and women who thus ac- 
cept him ; and it matters not where 
they go, they feel that they have a 
realization and a testimony of that 
truth which they would like all the 
world to accept and know. 

I rejoice in the knowledge that 
many of our boys who have gone 
out to establish liberty in the land 
possess that same testimony, and I 
am glad to get a glimpse, once in a 
while, of their efforts to bear that 
testimony to their soldier com- 
panions. I love these boys. I 
love the cause for which they are 
going to fisrht. I love the Nation 
they are called upon to defend and 
the principles of everlasting truth, 
so far as the liberty and freedom 
of mankind is concerned, for which 
it stands ; and when I see these boys 
impressed with the testirhony that 
Tesus Christ is their Savior and that 
he has appeared in this dispensation 
with the gospel which is the power 
of God unto, salvation, which is the 
science of life, the philosophy of 
true living, I thank God that they 
have a desire to influence their asso- 
ciates, and at least attempt to exert 
that influence to lead them to the 
same truth. Illustrative of this, and 
by way of commendation of a 
mother who has that same testi- 
mony, I wish to quote from a 
boy who met one of our boys in 
one of the cantonments. This boy 
from another state, Kentucky, I 
think, is writing to the "Mormon" 
bov's mother. The circumstances 
calling it forth may be inferred as 
I read. This young "Mormon" 
soldier is from Idaho. I chanced 



to meet him in Camp Morrison, Vir- 
ginia, a few weeks ago, but he 
knows nothing about my having 
this letter : 

"I can not tell you how glad I was 
when I met Burgess for it seemed to 
me that I was alone as far as friends 
were concerned, for there was not any 
in this squadron that I could trust as 
a friend until he came. The first time 
I saw him I knew he was living for 
something higher, and as we were of 
the same type, of course, we became 
fast friends. I certainly felt bad when 
the time came for him to leave the 
field. He did so much for me that it 
was hard to part. I have been striv- 
ing for a long time to make myself 
right with God, as I had fallen from 
grace and I felt that he could help 
m,e and he truly did. Of course it was 
hard for me to see just exactly as he 
did, but we just forgot for the time 
that we were of different faiths, and 
studied together and talked of and 
dug into spiritual things which I was 
so much in need of. He certainly 
showed his colors. And / wish that I 
was the young man that he is. I have 
been reading and studying the Book 
of Mormon and the Doctrine and 
Covenants which he gave me, and I 
see things different than I ever did 
before, and I only wish that he was 
here with me for he would be such a 
help to me. I don't know how I can 
ever return what he has done for me, 
and also your kind words and advice 
which means more to me than I can 
tell. I need help so badly, as it seems 
to me that something is in the way, 
for T do not feel spiritually as I 
should. I would be so happy if I 
could be as full of the spirit as Bur- 
gess is and as I once was. I try to 
get hold of all the good reading that 
I can and try to get just as far from 
bad company as I can get. I heartily 
thank you for the little book Key to 
Theology. You are doing so much for 
me that I almost feel ashamed that I 
can not return it some way, but I hope 
that some day I can in some way."

Field, and distances separating 
them, but that mother has the testi- 
mony that Jesus Christ is her Sav- 
ior, she evidently knows that God 
has spoken in this age, and she de- 
sires to lead others to know the 
same truth. So she is teaching the 
soldier boys by letter, trying to cul- 
tivate the good seed sown by her 
young boy, who, though scarcely 
out of his teens, ''showed his colors" 
by testifying to his companions that 
Jesus Christ is in reality the Son of 
God, • the Savior of the world. 

I will tell you, brethren, the time 
has come when not only individuals 
but nations must accept this truth. 
They must be guided in their na- 
tional and international dealings by 
the principles of everlasting truth 
and justice. The nation that started 
the terrible war now raging, started 
it because it ignored the principles 
of Christ. The Savior's life was 
guided principally by two things ; 
viz.. Individual Purity and Service. 
He kept himself wholly unspotted 
from the sins of the world, and de- 
voted his life to the consideration of 
others, to salvation for the human 
family. He was always looking out 
for the oppressed, comforting the 
sick, healing the maimed and dis- 
abled, giving his life for the world. 
So when a so-called Christian na- 
tion, or at least when a coterie of 
men, will meet together and decide 
months before the war breaks out, 
that a neighboring nation must be 
crushed in order that territory may 
be gained, I want to tell you that 
group of men, though professing, 
with their lips, at least, in Christ, do 
not believe in the principles he 
taught. 

I thank God that the United 
States upon entering the great con- 
flict started out with the declaration, 



"we go to fight for the ultimate 
peace of the world and for the liber- 
ation of its peoples, including the 
German people. We are seeking no 
selfish purposes of our own, we de- 
sire no conquests, we seek no ag- 
grandisement, we ask for no mate- 
rial compensation for the sacrifices 
we shall freely make ; all we ask 
is that nations, great and small, 
shall enjoy the liberty and the free- 
dom which God has given to the 
people of America." !n that re- 
spect, at least, we are emulating the 
teachings of the Savior ; and I see 
in it a preparation, as has been said 
time and again at this confer- 
ence, for the spreading of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, the true plan of 
salvation, the perfect law of liberty. 

May I say in conclusion, breth- 
ren, to you who hold the priesthood 
after the order of the Son of God, 
that a mighty responsibility is rest- 
ing upon you ; a great responsibility 
is resting upon the elders of Christ's 
Church, wherever they may be, to 
bear this testimony to the world that 
all who are honest in heart, and 
there are millions and millions of 
them. I think, who should have the 
privilege of hearing this gospel, may 
be brought to a knowledge of the 
truth. 

God hasten the day when "every 
knee shall bow and every tongue 
confess that Jesus is the Christ." 
Amen. 

"He intercedes for me," a .sacred 
duet, was sung by Mabel H. Clark, 
and Evan Arthur.

Questions on persistence of life that 
have arisen through the Great War — 
Literature that seeks to answer the 
question: What happens after death? 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



— No two writers agree — Testimony 
of the Holy Scriptures, the Bible 
and Book of Mormon — The testi- 
mony of Joseph Smith the Prophet 
to whom appeared in this dispensa- 
tion men who lived in former times 
— With these before us, why doubt 
the immortality of man? — Without 
other evidence the life of Jesus is 
sufficient to answer the question for- 
ever — All who die shall live after 
death, through faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, the 
hour is coming, and now is, when the 
dead shall hear the voice of the Son 
of God: and they that hear shall live. 

For as the Father hath life in him- 
self; so hath he gi\cn to the Son to 
have life in himself; and hath given 
him authority to execute judgment 
also, because he is the Son of man. 

Marvel not at this: for the hour is 
coming, in which all that are in the 
graves shall hear his voice, and shall 
come forth; they that have done good, 
to the resurrection of life; and they 
that have done evil, to the resurrec- 
tion of damnation (Jonn 5:25-29). 

Had I, or any other speaker, de- 
clared from this pulpit, four years 
ago, that the question pending- be- 
tween the Austro-Hung"arian Em- 
pire, and the Kingdom of Servia, 
resulting from the assassination of 
the crown prince of the former 
country, and his wife, while they 
were visiting in the Balkan States, 
would plunge the world into the 
most stupendous war of history, a 
war which would affect, either di- 
rectly or indirectly, every human 
being in the civilized world ; that 
millions of soldiers would be trained 
for war, and battles terrible beyond 
the dreams of men fought ; that na- 
tions would devote themselves to 
war until it would be easier to fight 
on than return to a condition of 
peace ; that our own country would 
become involved in it, and would 
equip and send to Europe vast ar- 



mies of men, and expend treasure 
almost beyond the comprehension of 
the human mind ; that- the bed of the 
ocean would be carpeted with sunk- 
en ships, and death hurled upon de- 
fenseless women and children from 
the air ; that before the end came 
whole nations would be blotted out, 
ancient autocracies go crashing 
down, and the guarantees of inter- 
national law be utterly ignored, he 
would have been regarded as either 
a harmless dreamer or a dangerous 
dunatic ; yet we who have . lived 
through the past four eventful years 
have witnessed the development of 
these conditions. 

Millions of men have been slain, 
other millions have been wounded 
and maimed for life. In some in- 
stances families with long and hon- 
orable history behind them have lost 
their last representative on the field 
of battle, and to all human appear- 
ances the worst is yet to come. 

This tremendous sacrifice of hu- 
man life, the thousands whose re- 
mains lie upon the ocean bed, and 
the countless numbers whose burial 
places will never be known to the 
parents, brothers, sisters and kins- 
men who sent them forth to battle, 
has awakened in the minds of think- 
ing people a widespread desire to 
know something of the condition of 
man after death. What happens 
after death? What of ourselves 
after death? Shall we ever meet 
these dear ones again? If there is 
a future life, what of our person- 
ality, does that persist, or are we 
to be so changed that we will have 
no greater knowledge or recollec- 
tion of conditions as they exist in 
this mortal life than we now have 
of the past? 

These are some of the pertinent 
questions which are being asked, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. WINS. 



83 



questions in which we are all vitally 
interested, for whether in peace or 
war, we are constantly being 1 separ- 
ated from those we love by this con- 
dition which we call death. 

Many books have been written 
and published, since the war began, 
in which the endeavor is made to 
answer this all important question, 
"What happens after death?" I 
have read a number of these books, 
in which the opinions of some of 
the world's greatest scholars and 
thinkers are expressed ; and as I 
read, the one striking thought which 
came to me was the great diversity 
of opinion which exists among these 
learned men. No two agree. There 
is a certain uniformity of opinion 
among Christian ministers, it is 
true, they all accept the doctrine of 
future life, but are hopelessly di- 
vided regarding the personality of 
the individual, and his relationship, 
in the life to come, with that which 
is in any way connected with this 
life. The doctrine of the resurrec- 
tion, if admitted at all, is held to be 
a kind of new sp : .ritual birth, while 
the reunion of the spirit and body 
of man, to become a diving mate- 
rial soul, is not admitted by a single 
writer. 

Among those who are most pro- 
nounced in their unbelief, Max Nar- 
dau, the great French scholar and 
author, is perhaps the most out- 
spoken. Death, he declares, means 
the final extinction of consciousness, 
and the eternal dissolution of what 
was a personality. The immortality 
of the personality, he says, is neither 
conceivable nor desirable, nothing- 
ness is more consoling. 

Sir Hyrum Maxim asserts that 
there is not one little particle of evi- 
dence to prove that we live after 
death, as preachers would have us 



believe. He argues that the only 
future life we may expect is as we 
live in our children, and that he who 
has failed to leave posterity is for- 
ever dead, 

John Blundelle-Burton would like 
to believe, but is in .doubt, because, 
he says, no one comes back to tell ; 
while Madam Besant assures us in 
the most positive terms that there is 
a life after death, but destroys our 
hope by telling us that we may be 
re-incarnated in the form of a plant, 
an animal, or some other human 
being, until we finally reach a con- 
dition that we pass into Nirvana, 
whatever that may be. 

Undoubtedly the fondest hope of 
every person .who has been sepa- 
rated from those he loves by death, 
is that at some future time, when 
he too is called, as he knows he 
must be, he will meet them and re- 
new the associations which bound 
him to them in this life. If there 
are men like Max Nardau, who 
really feel that a future existence is 
nether conceivable nor desirable, it 
is their privilege, I presume, to re- 
main in the : r faithless condition. I 
shall enter into no argument with 
them at this time, they deny the di- 
vine authenticity of the scriptures, 
and consequently no basis for dis- 
cussion, from the point of view of 
a Christian, exists. But to John 
Blundelle-Burton, who would like to 
believe, but is in douot because no 
one comes back to tell, or Madam 
Besant, who asserts her belief in a 
future life, but would have us accept 
her theory of re-incarnation, and 
most of all to those devout Chris- 
f'ans who earnestly believe in, and 
hope for, reunion with those they 
love after death, there is evidence 
sufficient to satisfy the most exact- 
ing mind, evidence which, when we 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



come to understand it, leaves us 
without doubt, and the testimony of 
the Christian is founded upon far 
more convincing proof than the 
opinion of the unbeliever. The lat- 
ter does not believe because he has 
not seen, but neither he, nor any 
witness he can produce can disprove 
the testimony of the Christian who 
has seen, he can only assert his un- 
belief, which proves nothing, though 
thousands do it. 

The testimony of one reputable 
witness, however, who avers that he 
knows because he has seen, is of 
great worth, and where many tes- 
tify to the same thing, the fact be- 
comes established, whether the mul- 
titude accept it or not. 

The holy scripture is not the pro- 
duct of a single mind. The contents 
of the Bible were not written by one 
hand, but by many. It does not deal 
with a single dispensation or period 
of time, but covers the world's his- 
tory, and the handdealings of the 
Father with the inhabitants of the 
earth, from the creation to the pre- 
sent, for men not only wrote their 
own observations and experiences, 
but by the spirit of revelation, and 
gift of prophecy, foretold the future 
with .such accuracy that only one 
who is determined to not believe can 
be left in doubt. To some of the 
truths bequeathed to us by the scrip- 
ture, and attested by men of God, 
I wish briefly to refer. 

One thing about the scriptures, 
which struck me with great force, 
when I began to study and under- 
stand them, is the fact that the word 
of the Lord never comes to us as an 
opinion, no attempt is made to sup- 
port it by argument, it comes as a 
/definite, abstract statement of fact. 
"In the begining God created the 
heavens and the earth. So God 



created man in his own image, in 
the image of God created he him, 
male and female created he them." 
So it is from the first words in the 
Bible to the last, the works of the 
Father are declared as facts, not 
theories. 

The words of the Redeemer, 
which I read before beginning my 
remarks, declare definitely that the 
hour is coming when all that are 
in the graves shall come forth, 
they that have done good to the 
resurrection of life, and they that 
have done evil to the resurrection 
of condemnation. In corroboration 
of this doctrine permit me to read 
from the words of Mormon, as he 
contemplated the slain of his people : 
"O, ye fair sons and daughters, ye 
fathers and mothers, ye husbands 
and wives, ye fair ones, how is it 
that ye could have fallen ? But be- 
hold ye are gone and my sorrows 
cannot bring your return, and the 
day soon oometh that your mortal 
must put on immortality, and these 
bodies which are now mouldering in 
corruption must soon become in- 
corruptible bodies, and then ye must 
stand before the judgment seat of 
Christ to be judged according to 
your works. And if it so be that ye 
are righteous then are ye blessed 
with your fathers who have gone 
before you" (Mormon 6:19-21). 

This doctrine of the universal 
resurrection of the dead is taught 
by Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and 
other of the prophets. That the dead 
will live again must be admitted by 
every believer in the Bible. 

Just as definite as is the doctrine 
of the resurrection, is the fact that 
all who participate in it must 
appear before the bar of God to be 
judged according to the deeds done 
in the body. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS.

Paul, writing to the Corinthian 
Saints, said : "If in this life only we 
have hope in Christ, we are of all 
men most miserable. But now is 
Christ risen from the dead, and be- 
come the first fruits of them that 
slept. For .since by man came death, 
by man came also the resurrection 
of the .dead. For as in Adam all die, 
even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive" (1 Cor. 15:19-22). 

In that remarkable revelation, 
given by Christ to the x\postle John, 
on the Isle of Patmos, which he sent 
and signified by his angel, we read : 
"And I saw the dead, small and 
great, stand before God ; and the 
books were opened ; and another 
book was opened, which is the book 
of life: and the dead were judged 
out of those things which were 
written in the books, according to 
their works. And the sea gave up 
the dead which were in it ; and death 
and hell delivered up the dead which 
were in them : and they were Judged 
every man according - to their 
works" (Revelation 20:12,13). 

The scripture which I have quoted 
makes clear two vital points of 
doctrine connected with this sub- 
ject, that as in Adam all die so in 
Christ all are made alive through 
the resurrection, and that the per- 
sonality of the individual persists 
after death, otherwise how could he 
be responsible for the deeds done in 
the body? 

The two outstanding attributes of 
God are justice and mercy. How 
can I in justice be held responsible 
for the transgressions of another or 
rewarded for his righteousness? 
No; I must answer for myself, just 
as you must answer for yourself ; so 
my personality must persist, I must 
be the same man, my future life in- 
separably connected with this life. 



We are told that upon a certain 
occasion Jesus took Peter, and 
James, and John, and went into a 
mountain to pray and behold there 
talked with him two men, which 
were Moses and Elias (Matt. 17: 
1-4). These men were seen of the 
apostles who bore record of their 
presence, which was so real that 
Peter suggested that three taber- 
nacles be constructed, one for Jesus, 
and one each for Moses and Elias. 
Moses lived 1500 years before 
Christ, and Elias, if we are to iden- 
tify him with the Elijah of the 
Bible, 1000 years before:, one in- 
stance from the many where some 
one came back to tell. 

The revelation given to John, on 
the Isle of Patmos, from which' I 
have quoted was delivered by a 
heavenly messenger, and when John 
would have bowed down to worship 
him he was forbidden, the messen- 
ger declaring that he was one of 
his fellow servants, one of the 
prophets who kept the command- 
ments of the book (Revelation 22: 
8-9). 

Of greater importance to us, be- 
cause we are more directly affected 
by it. is the appearance of men. who 
long since lived and died, in the 
present dispensation. Let Joseph 
Smith tell the story in his own sim- 
ple language. It should be remem- 
bered that at the time the first of 
these manifestations were given, 
Joseph Smith was a simple country 
boy, not yet fifteen years old. and 
incapable, even if he had so desired, 
to conceive of or execute a great 
fraud or deception. He simply de- 
sired to do his duty to God, and the 
great confusion among sectarian 
churches left him in doubt as to 
which denomination he should 
identify himself with. He went to 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Lord for wisdom, with the 
following result : 

In accordance with this, my deter- 
mination, to ask God, I retired to 
the woods to make the attempt. * * 
* * Having looked around me, and 
finding myself alone, 1 kneeled down 
and began to offer up the desires of 
my heart to God. I had scarcely done 
so, when I was seized upon by some 
power which entirely overcame me, 
and had such an astonishing influence 
over me as to bind my tongue so that 
I could not speak. Thick darkness 
gathered around me, and it seemed to 
me for a time that I was doomed to 
sudden destruction. But by exerting 
all my powers to call upon God to 
deliver me out of the power of this 
enemy which had seized upon me, and 
at the very moment when I was ready 
to sink dnto despair and abandon my- 
self to destruction — not to an imag- 
inary ruin, but to the power of some 
actual being from the unseen world, 
who had such marvelous power as I 
had never before felt in any being — 
just at this moment of great alarm, I 
saw a pillar of light exactly over my 
head, above the brightness of the sun, 
which descended until it gradually 
fell upon me. 

It no sooner appeared than I found 
myself delivered from the enemy 
which had me bound. When the light 
rested upon me I saw two personages, 
whose brightness and glory defy all 
description, standing above me in the 
air. One of them spake unto me, call- 
ing me by name, and said, pointing to 
the other: This is my beloved Son, 
hear him! 

Three years later, and after he 
had retired for the night, Joseph 
Smith says : 

While I was thus in the act of call- 
ing upon God, I discovered a light 
appearing in my room, which con- 
tinued to increase until the room was 
brighter than at noonday, when im- 
mediately a personage appeared at my 
bedside, standing in the air, for his 
feet did .not touch the floor. He had 
on a robe of most exquisite white- 
ness. It was a whiteness beyond any- 



thing earthly I had ever seen, nor do 
I believe that any earthly thing could 
be made to appear so exceedingly 
white and brilliant. His hands were 
naked, and his arms also a little above 
the wrists, so also were his feet naked, 
as were his legs a little above the 
ankles. His head and neck were also 
bare. I could discover that he had no 
other clothing on but this robe, as it 
was open, so that I could see into his 
bosom. 

Not only was his robe exceedingly 
white, but his whole person was glori- 
ous beyond description, and his coun- 
tenance truly like lightning. The 
room was exceedingly light, but not 
so very bright as immediately around 
his person. When I first looked upon 
him I was afraid, but the fear soon 
left me. He called me by name and 
said unto me that he was a messenger 
sent from the presence of God to me, 
and that his name was Moroni; that 
God had a work for me to do, and that 
my name should be had for good and 
evil among all nations, kindreds and 
tongues, or that it should be both 
good and evil spoken of among all 
people. 

| 

Six years after the a'oove incident 
the following is related by Joseph 
Smith : 

Two days after the arrival of Mr. 
Cowdery (being the 7th of April) I 
commenced to translate the Book of 
Mormon, and he began to write for 
me. We still continued the work of 
translation, when, in the ensuing 
month of May (1829), we on a certain 
day went into the woods to pray and 
inquire of the Lord respecting baptism 
for the remission of sins, that we 
found mentioned in the translation of 
the plates. While we were thus em- 
ployed praying and calling upon the 
Lord, a messenger from heaven de- 
scended in a cloud of light, and hav- 
ing laid his hands upon us, he or- 
dained us saying: "Upon you my fel- 
low servants, in the name of Messiah, 
I confer the priesthood of Araon, 
which holds the keys of the minister- 
ing of angels, and of the gospel of re- 
pentance, and of baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins; and 
this shall jiever again be taken from

the earth, until the sons of Levi do 
offer again an offering unto the Lord 
in righteousness." The messenger 
who visited us on this occasion and 
conferred this priesthood upon us, 
said that his name was John, the same 
that is called John tlie Baptist, in the 
New Testament. 

Many other instances might be 
cited where men who lived long ago 
have returned to the earth and 
communicated the will of the Lord 
to his servants here. If this be true, 
and it is, why should we be in doubt 
regarding the immortality of man, 
or his resurrection as a material be- 
ing, with a body of flesh and bone, 
as he now has, but a body cleansed 
and purified, no longer subject to 
the pain, suffering and final death 
with which mortality is burdened. 

If we had no other evidence the 
life of the Redeemer is sufficient to 
settle this question forever. Jesus 
was the Son of God, the Redeemer 
of the world. He came for the very 
purpose of making clear to us this 
mystery of human life. Born as we 
are born, he lived, labored and loved 
much as we do, except that the 
power of God, love, charity, pa- 
tience, .self sacrifice, those Godlike 
characteristics which were his birth- 
right, were manifest in his life as 
they never have been, and never will 
be, in any other human being. 
Finally, when his work was finished, 
he died, very much as we would 
have died under similar circum- 
stances. Up to this point the gerat 
mission which he came to perform 
was but little understood, but when 
on that Easter Sunday morning he 
arose from the tomb, with a- glori- 
fied body, the sting of death was 
made sweet, the victory of the 
grave was turned to defeat, for he 
made the resurrection of the whole 
human family not only possible, but 



a fact, whether they accepted him 
or not. 

His disciples doubted, and when 
he appeared to them they were ter- 
rified, supposing that they saw a 
spirit, for like some of us they could 
not understand that one who had 
lived and died, could live again, and 
Jesus said to them : "Behold my 
hands and my feet, that it is I my- 
self : handle me and see, for a spirit 
hath not flesh and bones, as ye see 
me have" (Luke 24:39). It was 
the same Christ, with the same 
body, but glorified, who stood be- 
fore them. Why should we be in 
doubt regarding the future status 
of the ,souls of men? I bear wit- 
ness to you that just as Christ was 
raised from the dead, with a mate- 
rial body which his disciples saw 
and felt, just as he will appear to 
the Jews with the prints of the 
nails in his hands and feet, and the 
spear wound in his side, so is it the 
■design of God that every one of us 
shall be raised from the dead with 
material, but not mortal bodies. 

The sea will give up the dead 
which are in it, the battle fields of 
France will give up the dead who 
are interred in them. Every mother 
who has lost a son, every kinsman 
who has lost a relative, will receive 
them back again through faith in 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and the as- 
sociations, the covenants, the bonds 
of love which bound us together in 
this life will be renewed and con- 
tinue with us throug"h the endless 
ages of eternity. 

I love the gospel because of this 
hope which has come to me. I live 
in anticipation of reunion with 
those I love after death. I want no 
heaven away from my own, but to 
be with my father and mother, my 
children and kindred, with you my

brethren and sisters, with whom I 
have labored and borne the burdens 
of this mortal life, and I know that 
my desire will be realized if I am 
true to the covenants which I have 
made with the Lord and my fellow 
men. 

I wanted to bear this testimony, 
hoping that it may bring comfort 
to all who are separated from those 
they love by .death. It is only for 
a little season. The graves will be 
opened, and the dead will come 
forth to answer for the deeds done 
in the body. God help us to live 
righteous lives, that we may be 
worthy of eternal life, through 
faith in Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I am forcibly reminded of the 
saying of the Savior about the rich 
man, who concluded that he had 
so much in the world that he could 
well rest content, and take his ease. 
The Savior said: 

The ground of a certain rich man 
brought forth plentifully: 

And he thought within himself, 
saying, What shall I do, because I 
have no room where to bestow my 
fruits? 

And he said, This will I do: I will 
pull down my bsrns, and build 
greater; and there will I bestow all 
my fruits and my goods. 

And I will say to my soul, Soul, 
thou hast much goods laid up for 
many years; take thine ease, eat, 
drink, and be merr>. 

But God said unto him, Thou fool, 
this night thy soul shall be required 
of thee: then whose shall those things 
be, which thou hast provided? 



done abominable works, there is 
none that doeth good. The Lord 
looked down from heaven upon the 
children of men, to see if there 
were any that did understand, and 
seek God. They are all gone aside, 
they are all together become filthy : 
there is none that doeth good, no, 
not one." 

I trust we are beyond and above 
this dreadful condition, and that we 
( 1 o know that our Redeemer lives, 
and that we have put on Christ, and 
have adopted his glorious plan of 
redemption and salvation and ex- 
altation beyond the grave. 

The choir sang the anthem : "God 
is our refuge," and conference ad- 
journed until 2 p. m. 

Prayer by Elder David H. Can- 
non, of St. George. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting of the con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 o'clock a. m., presided over by 
Elder Joseph W. McMurrin, of 
the First Council of Seventy. 

Singing- and music were furnish- 
ed by the combined choirs of Gran- 
ite stake, Professor Evan Stephens, 
conductor. 

The choir sang: "Guide us, O 
thou great Jehovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Milando Pratt. 

Singing: "Rouse, O ye mortals." 



I cannot refrain from mention- ELDER HUGH J. CANNON, 
ing the truth that was enun- 
ciated thousands of years ago : "The (President of the Liberty Stake of 
fool hath said in his heart, There is 

no God," and therefore no here- My brethren and sisters, I earn- 
after. "They are corrupt, they have estly solicit an interest in your faith

and prayers during the short time 
I shall endeavor to speak to you. 
The task of speaking- is one of the 
difficult tasks which I have to per- 
form in my ecclesiastical work. I 
love to work in the Church, love to 
go out as a ward teacher, and to la- 
bor as best I can among the Latter- 
day Saints, but whenever a call sim- 
ilar to this comes to me, T feel that 
it is utterly impossible for me, un- 
less the Lord will listen to my 
prayers and the prayers of those 
who listen to me, to say anything 
which will be of benefit to the peo- 
ple. And when I realize that the 
hundreds of people who are here 
this morning have come many 
miles, some of them, to hear the 
word of the Lord, I am filled with 
fear and trembling. 

I have dirtied 'this, however, in 
my experience, that the soul that 
hungers and thirsts after right- 
eousness is always satisfied, a and 
you, my brethren and sisters, who 
have come here with that spirit, 
with the desire to be renewed in 
your faith, to be built up and en- 
couraged in your efforts to serve 
the Almighty, will receive that for 
which you cariie. That promise 
has been made by the Almighty, 
and is manifest so often that no ar- 
gument is necessary to convince the 
Latter-day Saints of its truthful- 
ness. 

I was impressed this morning by 
the prayer which was offered, first 
by the choir and this congregation, 
and then bv our worthy brother, 
Milando Pratt. I am sure those of 
you who entered into the spirit of 
the hymn which was sung realize 
that we were offering a united 
prayer to the Almighty for our 
selves and for the world. I shall 
take the liberty of reading the last 
verse of the hymn which was sung: 



"When the earth begins to tremble, 

Bid our fearful thoughts be still. 
When thy judgments spread destruc- 
tions, 

Keep us safe on Zion's Hill." 

• I can think of no more proper 
prayer to be offered to the Al- 
mighty this morning by the Latter- 
day Saints than the prayer con- 
tained in this hymn. Certainly the 
earth is beginning to tremble and 
the destructions and the judgments 
of the Lord are spreading in the 
earth, and it seems a very fitting 
prayer that the Latter-day Saints 
should offer that we may keep safe 
on Zion's hill. 

In the midst of all these fearful 
things that are happening in the 
world today, the Latter-day Saints 
have occasion to look forward with 
calmness and patience and faith to 
the future. More than any other 
people in the world today, we know 
that the Lord, the Almighty, the 
Creator of this universe, is' guiding 
and directing 'the affairs of the 
world. These things „have been 
predicted. A great many of you 
brethren have been out in the world 
and have preached that the very 
things which are now happening 
should occur unless the world 
would repent and turn a listening 
ear to the gospel of peace, the gos- 
pel of salvation, which the Al- 
mighty in his goodness has re- 
stored. We have been preaching 
these things for many years. Many 
hundreds and thousands of the 
elders have borne this testimony 
to the world, and now we are per- 
mitted to see the fulfilment of the 
message, the prediction which it 
was our duty to deliver to the 
world. But we, the Latter-day 
Saints, have no occasion to fear, 
unless our own lives need looking 
into.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I was impressed with the thought 
expressed by President Joseph F. 
Smith, I think that it was in the 
June conference, Young Men's and 
Young Ladies' conference, though 
of that I am not absolutely sure. 
He made a statement to this effect. 
Many people are fearful, and I am 
asked frequently what is going to 
be the outcome of the terrible oc- 
currences which we see in the world 
today. He said : "the only thing I 
have to do, and the only thing the 
Latter-day Saints have to do is to 
live their religion, to serve the Lord 
in the proper spirit, and all will be 
well with them." I had been a lit- 
tle pessimistic up to that moment, 
had been a little fearful as to the 
final outcome of this terrible strug- 
gle, not that I felt it affected us 
particularly, but I looked on the 
dark side of the situation, and I felt 
that I had occasion to thank the 
Lord that I heard the testimony of 
the prophet of the Almighty on this 
subject, and no fear has been in 
my heart from that day to this, ex- 
cept the fear that we may not be 
able to so order our lives that we 
can claim the protection and the 
blessings of our Father in heaven. 

I know that the hand of the 
Lord is over this people. I know 
that if we will pray to him as Lat- 
ter-day Saints know how to pray, 
the prayer that this hymn contains, 
"when the earth begins to tremble," 
we have no need to fear. If we 
will observe the laws and the com- 
mandments which the Almighty has 
given us, if we will be prayerful 
and fumble, the Almighty must 
surely "keep us safe on Zion's hill." 
Did you ever think of the power 
and the confidence that prayer 
gives to people. We, I believe, are 
■strong as ordinary mortals are. The 
Latter-day Saints have as much 



physical strength and moral cour- 
age as any people in the world. We 
are just as able to meet difficulties 
and hardships and trials as any 
people that lives on the face of the 
earth, and in addition to that we 
have the reserve strength, the 
power which comes from faith in 
the Almighty, the assurance that 
we can go to him in the hour of 
distress, lay our burdens upon him 
and know that we will be relieved. 
Did you ever stop to think what a 
source of power and strength such 
faith will give to a people? That 
is the only thing that enabled the 
people to cross the plains and come 
into this country, forbidding and 
desolate as it was at that time ; but 
they knew the Lord was with them, 
and you cannot whip a people, you 
cannot conquer a people that has 
that unconquerable faith, because 
when disaster overtakes them, they 
acknowledge the hand of the Lord 
in it, possibly feeling that it has 
been brought upon themselves by 
their own misconduct. But they go 
to the Lord in humility and pray 
for strength to bear their burdens 
manfully and courageously ; as in 
times of prosperity, they thank the 
Lord for the blessings they enjoy. 
You cannot conquer a people with 
that sort of feeling. It is utterly, 
absolutely impossible. So I repeat, 
the Latter-day Saints can ioeic to 
the future, if they will only order 
their lives in accordance with the 
principles of salvation which have 
been revealed, with absolute con- 
fidence, with the assurance that all 
will come out well. 

Our hearts naturally go out to 
our fellow men who are suffering, 
those who are hungry and cold, 
those who arc suffering mentally 
because of the loss of their homes 
or their dear ones. We can sym- 



ELDER IV M. H. RICHARDS. 



91 



pathize with them. We can shed 
tears of sympathy for our fellow 
men, but that feeling does not nec- 
essarily have to be mingled with 
fear for ourselves. I think we 
should pray for the world, for 
those who are in distress. 

This thing touches me, I believe, 
as closely as anybody. For six 
years I labored among the German 
people. I have had them give me 
their last crust of bread. I have 
had them give me their bed, and 
make a couch for themselves on the 
floor, or sit up in a chair, not that 
I was willing to take these things 
from them, but they felt that I and 
my companions were messengers 
of the Almighty, and they felt hon- 
ored to do these things for us. I 
have advised the Saints in Ger- 
many, time and time again, as have 
all the other missionaries who have 
labored there, to be loyal to their 
country, to be loyal to their nation ; 
and now see the situation ! Your 
boys and mine are going out and 
trying to take their lives, and very 
properly so ; that is, I mean, when 
I say properly, we cannot do any- 
thing else ! We have got to be 
loyal to the United States. But a 
person who Jhas received at the 
hands of the German people, the 
poor Latter-day Saints and the 
honest investigators in that land, 
the blessings and courtesies which 
have come to him from them, can- 
not help but feel sorrowful and 
downcast in his heart when he sees 
the sufferings that are coming up- 
on them. 

I pray the Almighty to lighten 
the burden of the honest-hearted 
people in the world. I pray that 
the Lord will give success to the 
armies of the United States and the 
Allies, that this thing may be ter- 



minated, speedily and properly. I 
pray that the spirit of faith and 
prayer may rest upon the body of 
the Latter-day Saints, that we may 
grow in grace and in faith, with 
the assurance that God lives, 
ever burning in our hearts, and 
become stronger from day to day, 
that we may all know, every Lat- 
ter-day Saint, that the Almighty 
stands at the helm, and that he is 
directing this work, and that he 
will make it triumph in the earth, 
because he has promised to do so. 
That these blessings may be ours, 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM H. RICHARDS 

(President of the Malad Stake of 
Zion.) 

My dear brethren and sisters, I 
feel somewhat like Brother Cannon 
said he felt. I do not know any 
other position in the Church that is 
as difficult for me to occupy as this ; 
but he has had a little the advantage 
of me — he has had the opportunity 
of going out to preach the gospel 
to the world. That opportunity I 
have never had yet; and for that 
reason, I have always shunned as 
much as possible standing before 
the people to teach the principles of 
eternal truth. 

It is not because I have feared in 
my heart, or anything of that kind, 
to bear my testimony. I do not 
know of an opportunity that I ever 
had that I did not always bear my 
testimony to the truthfulness of this 
work. My labor has been at home, 
though I often wonder in my own 
mind what the brethren have seen 
in me to put me in the positions 
that I have occupied. They have 
generally been presiding positions, 
and I have always taken advantage 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the fact and induced the others 
to do the work. I tried as hard as 
I possibly could to get one of my 
counselors to take my place today, 
because he is able ; and I depend 
upon my counselors to a great ex- 
tent in preaching the gospel in our 
stake. 

I do rejoice, my brethren and 
sisters, in the principles of the gos- 
pel. I rejoice in the testimony that 
the Lord has given me of the divin- 
ity of this work. There has never 
been a doubt in my mind that I can 
remember with regard to the di- 
vinity of the work that the Lord 
has established for the salvation of 
his children here upon the earth ; 
and I have never been in a place in 
my life where I have been afraid to 
bear that testimony. I have had 
the opportunity to go amongst peo- 
ple who are not members of our 
Church, and labor amongst them in 
different ways, and I do not know 
of a day when the opportunity ever 
came when I was afraid in bearing 
my testimony to them that I know 
that the gospel is true ; and in talk- 
ing with a great many of them I 
have often thought within my own 
mind, that if I could explain the 
gospel as it appears to my mind, 
that I could convert anybody in the 
world. Those are the thoughts that 
generally come to me whenever 
contemplating upon the principles 
of eternal truth that our Father in 
heaven has revealed in this day. 

When we take into consideration, 
my brethren and sisters, the way 
that this Church came into exist- 
ence, the youth of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and his illiteracy as 
far as the learning of the world is 
concerned — and then for him to 
bring forth such a great and mar- 
velous work as has been brought 



forth — it seems to me that any man 
that will contemplate those things 
will have to come to the conclusion 
that this indeed is the work of God, 
and that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
must have been assisted by some 
power higher than man's. 

In the very early rise of the 
Church, my brethren and sisters, the 
revelation was given through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith to the 
Church that a great and a marvel- 
ous work was about to come forth 
among the children of men. We 
today have lived to see that great 
and marvelous work come forth, 
and today we can all testify that 
that prophecy which the Prophet 
made, that revelation which was 
given through him by our Father 
in heaven, has been literally ful- 
filled. The Church today is a great 
and marvelous work in the eyes 
of the people, and we all notice 
that, as the Savior said, "The leaven 
of the gospel will leaven the whole 
lump" — that it might be compared 
to a woman placing leaven in three 
measures of flour, and that it would 
leaven the whole lump. Now, I be- 
lieve that is the Condition, today. 
The world is looking upon the gos- 
pel, and is adopting a great many 
of its principles, while it does not 
recognize them as coming from the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

The quotation that was made by 
Brother Ballard yesterday, from the 
speech of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 
looks to me like a criterion to go by. 
He is looking forward to a church 
which a great many of the wise 
men of the world are looking for- 
ward to — a new church to come 
forth that will better prepare the 
people for an exaltation in the 
kingdom of God. It seems to me 



ELDER IV M. H. RICHARDS. 



93 



that they do not need to look 
further than the valleys of the 
mountains, amongst the Latter-day 
Saints. I believe that in this 
Church everything necessary for 
the salvation of the human family 
is contained. I do not know of any- 
thing- that we can think of that 
would be of benefit to us, as the 
children of our Father in heaven, 
upon the earth, but what is incor- 
porated in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. My 
testimony is strong as far as that is . 
concerned. I have labored in the 
Church from the time I was quite 
a young boy. I have been con- 
tinually in positions in this Church, 
and my testimony has grown 
strong. I know, beyond any doubt 
whatever, that this is the work of 
God, that we are engaged in a work 
that will save and exalt us in the 
kingdom of our Father in heaven 
if we will do our part. 
• But the question in my mind 
always is, as I say to our people, 
the only question that should be in 
our minds should be whether we are 
■doing our part or not — whether we 
are standing in holy places as we 
have been commanded by our 
Father in heaven, when the judg- 
ments referred to by our Father are 
being poured out upon the children 
of men. Our Father in heaven has 
warned us of these things. I was 
talking to a friend yesterday, and I 
said, "These things should not stun 
us very hard, because we have been 
looking forward for them ; the 
prophets all the way along the line 
have declared that these things 
would take place, and that the only 
way of escape from them is by 
yielding obedience to the principles 
of eternal truth, which our Father 
in heaven has revealed for men, re- 



quiring them to turn from their 
sins, and serve God, and keep his 
commandments." 

We realize, as a people, that if we 
could persuade the nations of the 
earth to accept the principles of the 
gospel, and turn from the errors of 
their ways, that these judgments 
would be averted. At least, we have 
instances of this kind on record. 
When Jonah was sent to Nineveh 
to declare unto the people that 
unless they repented of their sins 
and turned from the error of their 
ways, that that great city would be 
destroyed, we all remember how 
Jonah feared to go there, and he 
felt in his heart that possibly those 
things would not take place. But 
he had to go, and the people lis- 
tened to his instructions, turned 
from the error of their ways, and 
escaped that great judgment. We 
are told that they repented in sack- 
cloth and ashes. I said that that 
would save the world today. 

I have no doubt in my mind at 
all, but that if the nations of the 
earth would turn from the error 
of their ways and seek to serve God 
and keep his commandments, that 
those judgments which are now 
poured out would be avoided. I 
remember talking with one of the 
wisest of men, as far as the learn- 
ing of the world is concerned, time 
and time again. His parents came 
from the old country for the gos- 
pel's sake. He had become some- 
what skeptical in regard to the prin- 
ciples of the gospel, and a short 
time ago I was talking to him with 
regard to them, and he declared to 
me: "I did not believe that any 
such a war could take place." I said 
to him : "You people who are so 
wise in the things of the world did 
not believe that those things would 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



take place, but those who are fool- 
ish enough to believe in the proph- 
ecies of the prophets and the things 
that they told us, they told you 
right along all the time that these 
things would come." In order to 
get out of it, he said, "Wars gen- 
erally come every forty or fifty 
years, anyhow." And I said, "You 
wise men of the world were going 
to prevent them — they never could 
happen again." 

These things are testimonies to 
us that we are engaged in the work 
of the Lord, and I pray God to 
bless us each and every one, that 
we may do our part, as far as we 
possibly can, to get the people to 
stand in holy places, that we may 
avoid the judgments which the 
Lord is pouring out upon the peo- 
ple. May God bless us to this end, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

breaks, the shadows flee," was sung

I 

ELDER REY L. PRATT. 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

Brethren and sisters, the feeling 
that has been uppermost in my 
mind since the opening of this con- 
ference, has been that of gratitude 
and thankfulness to the Lord for 
his many blessings unto us as a 
people. I feel very thankful this 
morning to have the privilege of 
standing before you and of bear- 
ing my testimony concerning the 
divinity of the work that we are 
engaged in. I am thankful to the 
Lord for the instructions, counsel 
and admonitions that we have re- 
ceived throughout the conference 



thus far, and I feel especially thank- 
ful to the Lord that we have such 
noble and inspired man to guide 
and teach us. I am thankful to the 
Lord that the gospel, with all of 
the powers and authority that have 
ever pertained to it in any time of 
the world's history, is here with us 
today. I am thankful for the life 
of our beloved President, Joseph 
F. Smith, and that the Lord has 
abundantly strengthened him and 
blessed him thus far during this 
conference. And I feel that our 
hearts should go out in faith and 
prayer to the Lord to strengthen 
him and heal him wherein he is 
afflicted, and grant that he may 
live yet many years to be our leader 
and the mouthpiece of the Lord 
unto his people. 

We are living in a momentous 
time. We are living in the times, 
as has been stated here this morn- 
ing, of the fulfilment of the prom- 
ises and prophecies of the Lord. 
As has been intimated, we the 
elders of the Church who have 
been called into the mission field, 
have for many years quoted these 
prophecies and called upon the pe- 
ple of the earth to repent of their 
sins if they wished to avert the ca- 
lamities that the Lord had predict- 
ed would be poured clown upon the 
people in the event that they con- 
tinued in their wickedness. I thank 
the Lord that there are thousands 
of people among the nations of the 
earth whose hearts have been 
touched and who have listened to 
the testimonies of the elders, have 
investigated the principles of the 
gospel, repented of their sins and 
gathered out, and who are today 
striving to live in harmony with the 
teachings of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. There are many 



REY L. PRATT. 



95 



thousands of people in the world 
yet who are investigating, who have 
not yet received the gospel, that I 
think will do so, and I quite agree 
with what has been said at some of 
the sessions of the conference that 
we are attending, that there is quite 
a general spirit of investigation, of 
humility, of prayer coming over the 
nations of the earth and the peoples 
therein, and I feel that many will 
be touched in their hearts and many 
will cry, who have not yet done so, 
to the elders of the Church, just as 
the multitudes cried to Peter and 
his brethren in times of old, "Men 
and brethren, what shall we do?" 
And the only answer that can be 
given them is the one that was 
given by Peter to the multitudes on 
the occasion to which I refer, when 
he said : "Repent and be baptized, 
every one of you, in the name of 
Jesus Christ for the remission of 
your sins." That is the message of 
"Mormonism" to the world today, 
the message of faith in God, a God 
in whose image we are made. And 
to repent of our sins, not with the 
repentance that it is needful to re- 
pent of tomorrow, in that we turn 
again to our sins, but the absolute 
forsaking of sin and turning to a 
righteous life. Baptism is essential 
on our behalf that we may be 
washed clean and be made pure and 
receive a remission of our sins, and 
through that door, enter into the 
kingdom of our Father in heaven ; 
and the promise that was made of 
old stands good today, that all 
those who do so would receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost. This, I 
testify to you is a reality. I have 
seen its influence come upon many 
people in the world, and their lives, 
through its influence, have been 
fortified against evil and they have 



been able to withstand persecution, 
overcome temptation, and live, even 
in the midst of Babylon, the lives 
of Latter-day Saints. 

We are living in a time predicted 
of old. If you will refer to the 
24th chapter of Matthew, you will 
observe in the words of our Savior, 
some of the signs that should come 
unto the world that would indicate 
his second coming was close at 
hand. I shall not refer to them 
all, but wish bo call your attention 
to this particular sign that he gave, 
and that when there should be wars, 
and during a time such as we see 
at the present time, with pestilence 
and earthquakes and destruction in 
different parts of the world, that 
many should rise up in the name 
of the Lord, some even claiming to 
be the Savior of the world, and that 
many false prophets should arise, 
and that they should deceive many. 
Now, brethren and sisters, we en- 
counter, as we travel through the 
world, people who will quote this 
scripture to us and claim that our 
prophets, those whom we claim to 
be prophets raised up and endowed 
with power in these last days to or- 
ganize the Church and establish the 
gospel in the earth, are those who 
are the false prophets of whom the 
people are warned to beware. But, 
prior to that time, the Savior gave 
to the people a key by which they 
might know as to the divinity of a 
prophet, and he warned them to 
"beware of wolves in sheep's cloth- 
ing," and he said, ''By their fruits 
shall ye know them." 

Now, our prophet has warned us 
during this conference, along cer- 
tain lines. He spoke concerning 
the Word of Wisdom. I should 
like to read to you today that proph- 
ecy, or that word of the Lord as it

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



came through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, eighty-five years ago. I call 
attention to the fact that scientific 
research and' the scientists of thje 
earth have never from that day to 
this, found one thing concerning 
the laws of health and those things 
that were good and those that were 
not good for man, that has contra- 
dicted, in any sense, the word of 
the Lord in the Word of Wisdom. 
On the other hand, we find nations 
who are steeped in the vices con- 
demned in this .scripture, and peo- 
ples who thought that they could 
not live without partaking of these 
things, that have universally risen 
up and condemned the very things 
that they upheld before, and that, 
in accordance with this scripture as 
revealed to us through the prophet 
of the Lord. 

If this were all that we had, and 
it is not, for we have very much 
more that corroborates the fact that 
Joseph Smith was inspired of God ; 
but if this were all, we might very 
justly lay claim to the fact that 
.Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. I shall read this Word of 
Wisdom : 

1. A Word of Wisdom, for the 
benefit of the Counch of High Priests, 
assembled in Kirtland, and church: 
and also the saints of Zion. 

2. To be sent greeting — not by 
commandment or constraint, but by 
revelation and the word of wisdom, 
showing forth the order and will of 
God in the temporal salvation of all 
saints in the last days. 

3. Given for a principle with prom- 
ise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all saints, 
who are or can be called saints. 

4. Behold, verily, thus saith the 
Lord unto you, in consequence of 
evils and designs which do and will 
exist in the hearts of conspiring men 
in the last days, I have warned you, 
and forewarn you, by giving unto you 
this word of wisdom by revelation, 



5. That inasmuch as any man 
drinketh wine or strong drink among 
you, behold it is not good, neither 
meet in the sight of your Father, only 
in assembling yourselves together to 
offer up your sacraments before him. 

6. And, behold, this should be 
wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of 
the vine, of your own make. 

7. And, again, strong drinks are 
not for the belly, but for the washing 
of your bodies. 

8. And again, tobacco is no for the 
body, .neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for 
bruises and all sick cattle, to be used 
with judgment and skill. 

9. And again, hot drinks are not 
for the body or belly. 

10. And again, verily I say unto 
you, all wholesome herbs God hath 
ordained for the constitution, nature, 
and use of man. 

11. Every herb in the season there- 
of, and every fruit in the season 
thereof; all these to be used with pru- 
dence and thanksgiving. 

12. Yea, flesh also of beasts and of 
the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have 
ordained for the use of man with 
thanksgiving: nevertheless they are to 
be used sparingly: 

13. And it is pleasing unto me that 
they should not be used only in times 
of winter, or of cold, or famine. 

14. All grain is ordained for the 
use of man and of beasts, to be the 
staff of life, not only for man but for, 
the beasts of the field, and the fowls' 
of heaven, and all wild animals that 
run or creep on the earth: 

15. And these hath God made for 
the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger. 

16. All grain is good for the food 
of man, as also the fruit of the vine, 
that which yieldeth fruit, whether in 
the ground or above the ground. 

17. Nevertheless, wheat for man, 
and corn for the ox, and oats for the 
horse, and rye for the fowls and for 
swine, and for all beasts of the field, 
and barley for all uesful animals, and 
for mild drinks, as also other grain. 

18. And all saints who remember 
to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, 
shall receive health in their navel, and 
marrow to their bones, ' • , 

19. And shall find wisdom and 



REY L. PRATT. 



97 



great treasures of knowledge even 
bidden treasures: 

20. And shall run and not be 
weary, and shall walk and not faint: 

21. And I, the Lord, give unto 
them a promise, that the destroying 
angel shall pass by them, as the chil- 
dren of Israel, and not slay them. 
Amen. 

Now, brethren and sisters, we 
know that we are taught not to 
drink strong" drinks. We know that 
in our nation, many of the states 
have become "dry" because they 
have become convinced of the fact 
that this is truth and that strong 
drinks are not good for man. Our 
navy abolished strong drinks be- 
cause it increased the strength and 
efficiency of our sailors to be with- 
out liquor. At the time this reve- 
lation was given it was thought 
that men could not fight without 
their measure of grog ; also the best 
scientific research in the country 
has demonstrated beyond a .doubt, 
the fact that the use of tobacco is 
injurious to all those who partici- 
pate in its use. We find that sci- 
ence has shown in corroboration of 
this revelation that much meat is 
detrimental to the human system, 
Darticularlv if used in time of heat. 
We have found not only this, but 
we are today curtailing the appe- 
tites of the people at home that we 
might send wheat abroad to our 
allies and soldiers for the world has 
discovered that the best grain for 
the use of man, where men are put 
to the .severest test, is the grain 
that the Lord revealed to Joseph 
Smith as the grain designed for the 
use of man. There were experi- 
ments made in the early stages of 
the war with different grains, and I 
read an article wherein it stated 
that wheat was demonstrated to be 
superior as a food to any other 



grain, under the trying circum- 
stances that men are put to in the 
trenches and in the battles of Eu- 
rope. These things should make us 
think — they are in accord with the 
words of the Prophet whom the 
Lord has raised up in these last 
days, and I bear you my testimony 
that he was a prophet of the Lord, 
and we should follow his counsel 
and his admonition. And now, if he 
was a prophet of the Lord, the one 
that stands at the head of the 
Church today is just as much so as 
he was. 

We are facing a critical condi- 
tion in the world's history. There 
is a scarcity of food. There is hun- 
ger. There is starvation in the 
world. Thousands of people who 
are not of this Nation but are of 
other nations are starving to death 
today. They need food, and the 
prophet of the Lord has told us 
that it is our duty to raise food, to 
raise grain, to conserve our re- 
sources. This is just as much the 
word of the Lord to Israel today as 
is the prophecy that I have read 
concerning the Word of Wisdom. 
One of the things that makes me so 
thankful today, brethren and sis- 
ters, is to see your full faces, show- 
ing you are well nourished and con- 
tented, that you are not in want, for 
very recently, in fact for three 
months during this past winter I 
have been traveling in the land to 
the .south of us, even in the land of 
Mexico, and there I have seen the 
effects of war. The people in Mex- 
ico, not one or two or three or sev- 
eral hundred or thousand, but thou- 
sands of people there today are 
nearly starved to death as a result 
of the war that has existed in that 
land for seven years. It is not due 
to the fact that Mexico is non-pro- 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ductive. It is not due to the fact 
that the people, as is generally con- 
sidered or thought, would rather 
fight than work, but due to the 
fact that conditions have not been 
such that they have been able to till 
the soil and raise crops. An em- 
bargo has been placed against any 
food exportation into Mexico. And 
as I traveled down into that coun- 
try, I saw thousands of people come 
to the side of the train at places 
where we stopped, and beg for any- 
thing that would appease the pangs 
of hunger, and I think I can sense 
more . fully than I have heretofore, 
what is going on in Europe when 
we hear of the sufferings of the 
Belgians, the Serbians, the Rou- 
manians, and other peoples over 
there, and I imagine that I can see 
them today, just as I saw the little 
Mexican children, starving to death. 

You cannot conceive of it, even 
if I told you. Mothers with clothes 
ragged and torn, their own flesh 
drawn to the bone, holding little 
children, reduced to mere skeletons, 
their heads wobbling, scarce held 
up by an almost bare spinal col- 
umn. Many of them die dailv. One 
old man came to me whom I knew 
four and a half years ago. He was 
reduced almost to a skeleton. He 
said, "I am near starvation, and 
need help." And as he sat before 
me, he" said, ''Brother Pratt, you 
don't know what it is to be hungry." 
T believed him. I believe you don't 
know what it is to be hungry. My 
little children don't know wbat it is 
to be hungry. Thank the Lord, 
they have ravenous appetites. I 
have, you have, but we don't know 
what hunger is until hunger pinches 
the flesh off our bones. 

I was thankful the night I came 
home from Mexico. I have eight 



little children where I live, and 
every one was glad to see me. They 
piled all over me, and I sat there 
and loved them and kissed them, 
and thanked God that their little 
faces were full ; and I pray to God 
that the war may never bring to us 
the suffering" and starvation that 
has come to that people in Mexico 
and to other peoples of the world. 
x<\nd I want to tell you the way we 
can avert it. The way we can avert 
it is to live as the Prophet of the 
Lord has told us to live. V/e want 
to get behind this ; we want to raise 
breadtsuff , we want to raise wheat ; 
we want to raise beets for sugar ; 
we want to curtail our appetites in 
things that do not count. We want 
to buy War Savings stamps and 
Liberty Bonds. We want to save 
and provide our soldiers who have 
gone abroad to fight for liberty, 
and give them that which they must 
have to live. That is why we are 
doing these things. 

The Lord has said that this is a 
land of promise, a land blessed 
above all other lands upon the face 
of the earth, and he has given great 
and marvelous promises to those 
whom he has brought here ; and he 
said we should have peace if we 
would do certain things. I want to 
tell you, if we want to have what 
is coming to us as the people of the 
Lord, if we want to be blessed as 
we always have been and are, if we 
want to have our children around 
us at night full and rosy, we must 
live the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I thank the Lord that the great 
Naton, the United States, is wak- 
ing up in vital things. I thank the 
Lord that they are curtailing the 
use of intoxicating liquor. I thank 
the Lord for the prospect of nation- 
wide prohibition. I thank the Lord 



ELDER REY L. PRATT. 



99 



for the noble work that the .depart- 
ments of this government are doing 
in regard to curtailing vice in the 
vicinity of our great cantonments, 
inasmuch as the boys don't restrain 
themselves of their own volition. 
They are making of the men of this 
nation a virtuous army, and they 
are striving to curtail and keep 
within the commandments of the 
Lord, and make us a people that 
will conserve this land to us as the 
most blessed land in all the world. 

I dont' want to trespass upon 
your time, but I wish to read to 
you in conclusion, the word of the 
Lord, as it came to the brother of 
Jared, concerning this land, when he 
came here so many years ago, and 
the Lord showed to him how he 
might dwell here in peace and con- 
tentment and happiness : 

And he had sworn in nis wrath unto 
the brother of Jared, that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, 
from that time henceforth and for- 
ever, should serve him, the true and 
only God, or they should be swept off 
when the fulness of his wrath should 
come upon them. 

And now we can behold the decrees 
of God concerning this land, that it is 
a land of promise, and whatsoever na- 
tion shall possess it, shall serve God, 
or they shall be swept ,off when the 
fulness of his wrath shall come upon 
them. And the fulness of his wrath 
cometh upon them when they are 
ripened in iniquity: 

For behold, this is a land which is 
choice above all other lands: where- 
fore he that doth possess it shall serve 
God, or shall be swept off: for it is 
the everlasting decree of God. And 
it is not until the fulness of iniquity 
among the children of the land, that 
they are swept off. 

And this cometh unto you, O ye 
Gentiles, that ye may know the de- 
crees of God, that ye may repent, and 
not continue in your iniquities until 
the fulness come, that ye may not 
bring down the fulness .of the wrath 
of God upon you, as the inhabitants 
of the land hath hitherto done. 



And in passing I will say that the 
Jaredite people forsook this counsel 
and brought down the wrath of 
God upon this land, and were abso- 
lutely and utterly wiped off .the 
face of the land because of their 
iniquity, and such was the case in 
regard to the Nephite people. They, 
too. because of their iniquity, even 
though they had the prophets of 
the Lord to teach them to the very 
last and to call them to repentance, 
became so ripened in iniquity that 
the Lord fulfilled his word and 
wiped them off the face of the land. 
It should be a warning to us. 

Behold, this is a choice land, and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it, 
shall be free from bondage, and from 
captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, who hath been manifested by 
the things which we have written. 

Now, we have this as a standing 
promise, and I am sure that as long 
a.s the people of this land preserve 
their virtue and integrity, this land 
shall be free from all other nations 
of the earth. We need have no 
fear from Germany other than the 
fear that naturally creeps into our 
hearts at having our sons killed at 
their hands over there ; but as far 
as their invading America and com- 
ing over to rule over this land, it 
shall never be, so long as we ac- 
knowledg'e the hand of the Lord 
and his Son Jesus Christ, or so 
long as we serve the God who rules 
over these nations. Is it worth the 
while ? is it worth the price ? Would 
you like to see come to you and 
yours what has come to the Bel- 
gians, the French, the Serbians, the 
Roumanians, and all those who 
have been overrun by the power of 
a tyrannical autocracy? I do not 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



condemn the German people indi- 
vidually ; but I condemn the spirit 
that is the curse of the world today, 
and that would enslave all the in- 
habitants of the earth. I would 
rather give my body and my son's 
body and my race than to see them 
dominate and come over here and 
usurp our rights and tyrannize over 
us ; but I would rather avert it by 
the simple means the Lord has 
given us, even that of living accord- 
ing to the commandments of the 
Lord. His commandments are to- 
day to abstain from evil, to produce 
food, and to raise that which is nec- 
essary to maintain life. Let us 
hearken to the words of the Lord, 
and let us go hence and carry to 
the people these instructions. Let 
us he Latter-day Saints, and live 
each day in harmony with the will 
of the Lord as it is made manifest 
to us. 

In conclusion, I testify to you 
that I know that God lives. I know 
that his Son Jesus Christ came to 
the world in very .deed, and is the 
Redeemer of the world. I know 
that Joseph Smith received a visi- 
tation from them, and later from 
Peter, James and John, and re- 
ceived the authority to establish the 
Lord's work in these last days. I 
know that those who have succeed- 
ed him in the First Presidency of 
the Church have held the same au- 
thority, and I testify to you that I 
know that Joseph F. Smith, who 
stands at the head of the Church to- 
day, is the mouthpiece of God to all 
the peoples of the earth. May the 
Lord bless us, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A song, entitled, "The Pioneer," 
was sung by Don C. Priestly, the 
singing being preceded by an ex- 



planation given by Professor Evan 
Stephens, who said: 

"I know it is unusual to make ex- 
planations before singing a song; 
but I feel that you will get more 
benefit if I say a word about this 
one. It is an attempt to represent 
the feelings of President Brigham 
Young, when he first looked upon 
this beautiful valley where we are 
now making our homes. The first 
portion is to represent him when he 
looked out upon the valley ; the sec- 
ond, the thoughts of the trials which 
they had passed through ; and the 
third, the culmination, centers 
around the idea expressed when he 
said, 'This is the place !' " 

ELDER JOSEPH R. MURDOCK. 

(President of the Wasatch Stake of 
Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel' 
with all my heart that the prayer 
which was offered at the opening 
of these services has been literally 
fulfilled, wherein Brother Pratt ex- 
pressed the thought that we had 
met here to have our spiritual faith 
renewed, and to be strenguiiened 
in the gospel of Christ, I feel that 
that has been a condition that has 
existed on this occasion, and I be- 
lieve it exists because those who are 
assembled here have asked of our 
Father in their hearts that it should 
be, and he has promised us from 
the earliest existence of this Church 
that those who ask shall receive, 
those who knock, it shall be opened 
unto them. He that lacketh wis- 
dom, we learn from the testimony 
and the experience of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in the words of James, 
Let him ask of God, who giveth 
liberally to all men, and it shall be 
given. And God has poured out his 



JOSEPH R. MURDOCK 



101 



Spirit upon us in testimony and in 
nrophecy upon this occasion, which 
must be truly gratifying to the 
heart of every Latter-day Saint 
who has listened to it. It has 
caused,, no doubt, in many in- 
stances, our hearts to go out in sym- 
pathy for the sufferings of those 
throughout the world who have 
not, and whose parents have not, 
accepted the gospel, and for the 
tribulations and sorrow that come 
to them. It makes it even griev- 
ous for us to bear and consider. It 
reminds me of one of the sayings 
of the Savior, wherein he said : 
"How oft would I have gathered 
you as a hen gathereth her chick- 
ens, but ye would not." Is that 
not the testimony that could be 
borne by our elders who have gone 
into the south country (Mexico), 
as Brother Pratt has explained, and 
into the foreign countries across 
the sea, and preached to them the 
humble doctrine of Jesus Christ, of 
faith, repentance, humility, and of 
serving God and keeping his com- 
mandments? But through the pride 
of their hearts they have rejected 
the counsel of God against them- 
selves, and now they suffer the con- 
sequences. Our hearts freely go 
out in sympathy for them, and if 
we could, we would do all that lies 
in our power to help them, and 
there is yet a chance to help them. 

The Savior, when he was asked 
by his disciples at Jerusalem, when 
he was speaking of the destruction 
of the temple and of his second 
coming, or what I think is termed 
the end of the world, said that such 
tribulations, speaking of his com- 
ing, shall be as never was before or 
never shall be. And do we not find 
that the testimony of all writers 
and historians, acquainted with the 



history of the world, is that such 
tribulations never did exist before 
as are existing at the present time? 
And where is the renedy ? The Lord 
has said that if it were not for the 
elect, no flesh would be saved, and 
if the Latter-day Saints are not 
the elect the doctrine which they 
preach is not the doctrine of Christ. 
They are nowhere else to be found 
upon the whole face of the earth ; 
and if we are the elect, and for our 
sake, they may be saved of their 
sufferings. Is it not our duty in 
great faith and prayer to call upon 
God the eternal Father, that he will 
overrule the destinies of nations to 
the end that the righteous may be 
saved, that the sins of the fathers 
may not be extended many gener- 
ations upon their children, and that 
their children may be saved from 
these terrible conditions existing 
almost throughout the whole 
world ? 

And here is a mission for us, my 
brethren and sisters. It is for us 
to importune the Almighty in faith 
and in prayer for their sakes and 
for our own sake, that we may be 
the elect, that we may have power 
to approach our heavenly Father in 
great faith and humility. 

I am wondering, when I think of 
that, how can we approach the Al- 
mighty in faith, if we are disre- 
garding his commandments, if we 
are still using a little tea and a lit- 
tle coffee, and ' a little alcoholic 
drinks, and other things which God 
has forbidden us to use ? How can 
we approach him in behalf of suf- 
fering humanity, if we have not put 
ourselves aright before our Father 
in heaven ? It seems to me that this 
duty devolves upon us, — the duty 
of charity and love.which should not 
begin in "Russia nor in Europe, nor 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in Mexico, but in our own hearts, 
in our own homes, with our breth- 
ren and sisters, with our wives and 
children. It seems to me that as 
Latter-day Saints, as the elect in 
these mountains, we are to put our 
hearts truly in shape. What would 
be the result if this whole Nation 
were to observe the commandments 
which the Lord gave to the Prophet 
Joseph? And thanks be to the Lord 
we have been trained as a people 
for nearly a hundred years, in all 
that our great and good govern- 
ment would ask us to do, trained in 
doing the great things which our 
great government has now discov- 
ered are the proper things that we 
should observe and do, even to the 
contributing of our means for the 
purchase of thrift stamps, Liberty 
bonds and for every other purpose. 

The Lord has trained us to con- 
tribute one-tenth of all we receive 
for humanity's sake, and if we have 
observed that doctrine well, and it 
has been truly implanted in our 
hearts, we will have very little 
trouble in adding on a little more 
along the same line, in addition to 
the payment of our tithes and our 
offerings. 

I am wondering, my brethren and 
sisters, if we are keeping our cove- 
nants with our Father in heaven, if 
we are mindful of the responsibili- 
ties which we took upon ourselves 
in the waters of baptism, to be true 
to God and to keep his command- 
ments ! I am wondering if we take 
the time upon the wSabbath day to 
attend to our sacrament meetings, 
and testify to our Father in heaven 
through partaking of the emblems 
of the flesh and blood of his Only 
Begotten Son at the communion 
table, or if we prefer to stay at 
home. Have we the desire to take 



upon us the name of Christ, and 
keep his commands, that his Spirit 
might be with us, that we might 
have faith when we call upon him 
in prayer that our prayers shall be 
answered ? 

Brethren and sisters, we are the 
elect, we who are gathered as the 
people of the Lord. We heard yes- 
terday where the voice of God 
would be heard ; that it would be 
among his elect, and not in Ger- 
many. What a fallacy in the ideas 
expressed by the German emperor 
that he is the vicegerent of God ! 
God is not so radically inconsistent ! 
There is no comparison between 
God's work here upon the earth, 
and the life of the Savior, and that 
of the Kaiser. Christ gave his 
whole time while he dwelt among 
men for saving humanity, even the 
weak, the sick, the afflicted, the old 
and the young. He said "Suffer 
little children to come unto me, for 
of such is the kingdom of heaven." 
That was the testimony of our Sa- 
vior, in whose footsteps we are 
striving to follow. What a vast dif- 
ference between that and the state- 
ment of the monster to his armies, 
to the effect : "Leave your mark 
when you go through the great 
cities, that you may strike terror to 
the inhabitants of the world, even 
to the extent of killing, crucifying 
women and children, soldiers, pris- 
oners or any one, that terror may 
come into the hearts of the people ! 
That the fear of the sword and of 
the aim of the Kaiser, (who falsely 
represents that he is a representa- 
tive of the Almighty) might strike 
terror to the hearts of the people. 
Oh, what a difference from the 
spirit of the Savior, from the spirit 
of the Latter-day Saints, who have 
gone into the world and gathered 



ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG 



103 



out the humble, the poor, the meek 
and those who are seeking after 
God. What a difference ! Even 
those who have not received a tes- 
timony of the gospel as we have, it 
seems to me must see and believe. 
When this great work is finished 
which God is permitting to level 
down the nations and to bring them 
into a condition that the gospel 
truths will find lodgment in their 
hearts, even those who have not yet 
had faith to understand the divinity 
of the Prophet Joseph's mission 
ought to be able to see, from the 
conditions which surround them, 
where God is. 

We are in the hands of the Al- 
mighty. It remains for you and 
for me to decide whether we will 
serve God or whether we will con- 
tinue to satisfy the lusts of the 
flesh, our appetites and passions, 
disregarding the rights and the 
feelings of our brethren with whom 
we are associated ; or whether we, 
like Joshua, v/ill say in our hearts, 
"As for me and my house, we will 
serve the Lord." We will go home 
in a few days from this conference. 
We will remember what we have 
heard, no doubt, but will we put it 
into practice ? If we do, we may 
be counted the most loyal citizens 
in this great government, a fact 
that is being witnessed and testified 
to by almost every requirement that 
is made at our hands. We believe 
the truth, which is as old as the 
everlasting hills, as old as the stars 
in heaven, that it is the right of the 
people to have equal rights one with 
another. These are principles for 
which the battles in heaven were 
fought, that men might enjoy their 
own agency, and come back to our 
heavenly Father on account of the 
desires in their hearts to do so, and 



not because of the fear of the sword 
or the flame. 

May God's blessings abound with 
us, and may we teach these prin- 
ciples to our children, and to those 
who are among us that have not 
received the truth ; that charity and 
love and peace may prevail, and 
the love of God may extend from 
ocean to ocean, and from one end 
of the earth to the other ; that the 
time may speedily come which the 
Savior taught us to pray for, when 
he said, thy will may be done on 
the earth as it is done in heaven, is 
my prayed in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ROBERT D. YOUNG. 

(President of the Sevier Stake of 
Zion) 

I feel that of all the duties placed 
upon me from time to time, at- 
tempting to speak to a congregation 
of Saints is the most difficult. 

I believe that the wonderful tes- 
timony borne by our beloved Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith, at this con- 
ference has strengthened every per- 
son who heard it, which is true al- 
so of the strong and inspiring tes- 
timonies of the other brethren who 
have spoken. 

We are indeed blessed to have 
such great men, inspired of God as 
they are, so let us appreciate them 
and heed their counsels. 

In looking over the vast congre- 
gation of people assembled at this 
conference, and realizing the many 
blessings we enjoy through the gos- 
peb I thought of the words of the 
Prophet Isaiah, which read some 
thing like this : God's ways are 
not man's ways, neither are his 
thoughts man's thoughts, for as the 
heavens are higher than the earth, 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



so are his ways than our ways, and 
his thoughts than our thoughts. 

Elders have gone to the nations 
of the earth, calling the people to 
repentance, saying, in the Spirit of 
the gospel, Repent, O inhabitants 
of the earth. Many heeded the 
warning cry of the humble messen- 
gers of the Lord, and as a conse- 
quence they are here with their chil- 
dren and children's children, en- 
joying the blessings that they never 
could have received aside from the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I believe 
many sense it more now than ever 
before. Here we are in this great 
land of America the best country 
in the world, and by God's guidance 
brought here as his people, to the 
safest spot of this great country, 
here to abide, during the world's 
crises. No doubt our hearts re- 
joice because we obeyed. But do 
we fully appreciate at all times 
these blessed privileges which the 
gospel affords us? If we do, is it 
manifest in our teaching to our 
children? As directed in the Rev- 
elation, do we teach them that Jesus 
is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God? If we are not doing this, we 
are told in the revelation that the 
condemnation for failure will rest 
on us parents. 

It was not by chance that we 
came to these valleys of the moun- 
tains, but it was through the work- 
ing of the well-defined plan of our 
heavenly Father, and we have been 
made prosperous, in order that we 
may do our duty in helping the 
poor, struggling peoples in the 
world? 

I received a letter the other day 
from one of our boys who is now 
paymaster at one of the canton- 
ments, and he said : "I know that 
you did not feel that I was doing 
my whole duty while at home, but 



when I came out here and mixed 
with the world, and moved among 
those who belonged to other 
churches, and the men in the army, 
I began to think of the teachings 
that I received at my mother's knee. 
There are fifteen of us here, and 
the other day the officer askd me to 
call my companions together, line 
them up, as he would like to have 
our pictures." So the fifteen "Mor- 
mon" boys lined up to have their 
pictures taken. And the officer 
complimented them on being the 
cleanest, nicest lot of boys in the 
camp. He says further : "We 
went to where our people held 
their meetings, and you ought to 
have seen the tears roll down our 
cheeks when they sang the first 
song, one of the songs of Zion. The 
tears rolled down our cheeks, and 
our hearts just swelled with ap- 
preciation. Oh, I have heard you 
at home say, people would get that 
hunger, not for bread ; thirst, not 
for water, but for the word of the 
Lord. We were hungry, we were 
thirsty — starving for the word of 
the Lord from his servants." 

When I read the letter I won- 
dered if we do really our whole 
duty to our children, and do as the 
prophet of the Lord said we should 
do : observe home evening where 
we might gather our children 
around us, and teach them the plan 
of life and salvation, to keep them- 
selves pure, brave and high-minded 
and unspotted from the sins of the 
world. 

Brothers and sisters, the Lord 
has given us about eighty-eight 
years for preparatory work to pre- 
pare ourselves and our children for 
the time when it would become ne- 
cessary for thousands of our boys 
and girls to stand side by side with 
the people of the world, many of 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



105 



whom have not heard the gospel, 
and teach the truth by their clean, 
pure and sweet lives. I do not fear 
the dangers of war as I do men and 
women who place no value on the 
high standard of morality that we 
stand for as a people. O that we 
could impress upon the hearts of 
our children these everlasting truths 
that this is the Church of God, and 
there is no other, and that there is 
no hope of everlasting peace for 
this world outside of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

May God bless us. May we be 
able to appreciate our responsibil- 
ities and accomplish the duties 
resting upon us. May we not be 
classed with those of whom the 
Lord spoke : "He that putteth his 
hand to the plow and looketh back 
is not worthy of the kingdom of 
heaven." May we be valiant, so 
that when we sing the beautiful 
hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for 
a prophet," we may follow its coun- 
sel when he asks us to perform a 
duty, and go and do it without 
question. Then we would become 
a strength to the work in which we 
are engaged. May God bless us, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The combined choirs of Granite 
stake sang the anthem : "Christ is 
risen." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Willard Larson Jones, Presi- 
dent of the Moapa stake of Zion. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

An open air meeting was held at 
the front of the Bureau of Informa- 
tion Building, Elder Rulon S. 
Wells, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty, presiding. 



The music was furnished by the 
Ensign Stake Male Chorus, Henry 
Giles, conductor, A. B. C. Ohlson, 
organist. 

The chorus sang : "We are sow- 
ing." 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. 
E. Dinwoodey. 

The chorus and congregation 
sang: "The Spirit of God like a 
fire is burning." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(President of the Southern States 
Mission.) 

Brethren and Sisters: I am 
pleased that I am privileged to 
join with you in the worship of the 
Lord on these historic grounds. 
Many years ago,, when members of 
the Church emigrated from Eng- 
land to Utah in quite large numbers, 
Charles Dickens went to see a 
ship-load of the emigrants. He ad- 
mitted that he went to bear tes- 
timony against them, but when he 
observed the good order, discipline, 
religious fervor, the excellent man- 
ner in which they were organized 
as a company for the voyage, the 
great English author, in a publish- 
ed account of his visit said, "Some 
remarkable influence had produced 
a remarkable result which other 
organizations have not been able 
to accomplish." Like the man who 
went to meeting to scoff, but re- 
mained to pray, Dickens went to 
criticise, but remained to praise. 

When President Joseph F. Smith 
and his party visited the South, in 
November, 1914, the Mayor of At- 
lanta had a pleasant interview with 
them. The latter related to the Pres- 
ident the favorable impressions he 
(the Mayor) received when he 
visited Utah. As he surveyed the 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



great work done in the west by the 
"Mormon" people in reclaiming the 
desert, establishing communities 
devoted to industry, orderly and 
law-abiding, as he viewed the com- 
fortable homes, the fine school 
buildings and churches, the Atlanta 
executive said that he could not 
help but feel that surely a power 
higher and greater than human 
power was with the "Mormon" 
people. 

You and I know what that "re- 
markable influence"is, brethren and 
sisters. It is the influence, the 
Vjower of the gospel and the priest- 
hood operating in our lives. "Now," 
said Jesus, "ye are clean through 
the word which I have spoken unto 
you." The resurrection does not 
cleanse the soul : it does not wash 
away sin : for the wicked shall come 
forth unto the resurrection of dam- 
nation. "But if we walk in the light, 
as he is in the light," said John, "we 
have fellowship one with another, 
and the blood of Jesus Christ his 
Son cleanseth us from all sin" 
(John 1:7). The precious, atoning 
blood of Jesus Christ is applied to 
our ,sins by and through obedience 
to the principles and ordinances of 
the gospel. "We believe that the 
first principles and ordinances of 
the gospel are: First, Faith in the 
Lord Jesus Christ ; second, Repent- 
ance ; third. Baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins ; fourth, 
Laying on of hands for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost." 

God has given unto us the Holy 
Priesthood, but the power of the 
priesthood is not exercised in the 
spirit of compulsion or coercion : it 
is exercised in brotherly kindness 
and charity, persuasion, service. In 
answer to an inquiry concerning his 
great and good influence with his 



people, the Prophet Joseph is said 
to have replied : "I teach them 
correct principles, and they govern 
themselves." 

The Savior impressed upon his 
apostles the spirit of service. "Who- 
soever," he said, "will be great 
among you, let him be your min- 
ister ; and whosoever will be chief 
among you, let him be your servant ; 
even as the Son of man came not to 
be ministered unto but to minister, 
and to give his life a ransom for 
many" (Mathew 20:26-28). King 
Benjamin taught his people wisdom 
when he said: "Learn that when 
ye are in the service of your fellow- 
beings ye are only in the service of 
your God" ( Mosiah 2:17). Your 
sons, husbands and brothers on the 
bloody battlefields in France are in 
the service of their fellow-beings, 
and therefore in the service of their 
God. "The cause of human liberty," 
said the Prophet Joseph Smith, "is 
the cause of God." W r hat a noble 
and sublime thought ! We hold that 
Joseph Smith was one of the fore- 
most exponents and champions of 
human liberty. Our soldier boys 
are fighting for the cause of human 
liberty. They are battling for a 
cause which God looks upon and 
approves. 

We gather strength and comfort, 
my brethren and sisters, in contem- 
plating the life of our Savior and 
the spirit in which he worked. He 
was "touched with the feeling of 
our infirmities," said Paul. The 
same apostle said that our Lord"was 
sent into the world that he by the 
grace of God should taste death for 
every man." He is the captain 
of our salvation "made perfect 
through suffering." "Though he 
were a Son, yet learned he obedi- 
ence by the things which he suffer- 



ELDER JOHN A. ELI SON 



ed ; and being- made perfect, he be- 
came the author of eternal salvation 
unto all them that obey him." We 
are perfected through suffering and 
fitted for entrance into eternal life. 
The man who has not suffered and 
sacrificed for the right has not 
accomplished much for the uplift of 
humanity. 

Jesus "was in all points tempted 
like we are, yet without sin." Not 
to yield to temptation, but to resist 
and overcome it is a glorious vic- 
tory. We are prone to think that 
we have temptations and struggles 
which others have not, but Paul 
says : "There hath no temptation 
taken you but such as is common 
to man : but God is faithful, who 
will riot suffer you to be tempted 
above that ye are able ; but with the 
temptations also make a way to es- 
cape, that ye may be able to bear it" 
(I. Cor. 10: 13). 

We grow great in giving. It is 
not what we receive which makes us 
great, but it is that which we give 
that secures greatness. The Latter- 
day Saints are a great people be- 
cause they have sacrificed and given 
for the benefit of their fellow-be- 
ings. They send their sons and 
'daughters to preach the restored 
gospel in the world ; they pay their 
tithing to build temples and meet- 
ing-houses, seeking always to build 
up the kingdom of God. The mis- 
sion of the Church is to preach the 
gospel as a witness unto all nations, 
to prepare a people for the glorious 
second coming of the Lord. This 
is our message, "Forget me, if you 
choose, but I plead with you not to 
forget the message we bring unto 
you." I • invite you, my fellow- 
beings, who are not in the Church 
"to come and be baptized unto re- 
pentance, that ye also may be par- 



takers of the fruit of the tree of 
life." 

Before this Nation entered the 
world war, it was regarded by many 
across the water chiefly as a big, 
rich, commercial nation. But today 
this mighty Republic is great in the 
hearts of the people of the nations 
of the earth. America is filling her 
Godgiven mission by carrying (to 
mankind the gospel of freedom, the 
pearl of human liberty. The heart 
of the President of the Church beats 
true and in sympathy with the hopes 
and aspirations of his fellow-men 
to enjoy the rights and principles 
which God has given them for their 
heritage and for their happiness and 
protection. Every one of us is 
called upon to make sacrifices. The 
Lord loveth a cheerful giver. Let 
us give comfort and strength to our 
country by purchasing Liberty 
Bonds, thrift stamps, and we will be 
blessed of the Lord for doing this. 
I bear my testimony to the truth of 
the gospel, the power of God unto 
salvation, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. ELISON. 

(President of the Raft River Stake 
of ZionJ 

My dear brothers and sisters: 
There may be some in this audience 
before me who do not understand 
what "priesthood" means. It is the 
power of God delegated to man. 
Man cannot act for God, and it be 
approved of God, unless he have 
power from him so to do. Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, had first to re- 
ceive the priesthood before he had 
the right to act for God. 

I want to quote a simple scrip- 
ture here. We have heard and read 
it a great many times. But I won- 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



der if the force of it appeals to us. 
The Savior said, "Ask, and ye shall 
receive, knock and it shall be open- 
ed unto you, seek and ye shall find." 
If Joseph Smith, the "Mormon" 
prophet, had not sought, had he not 
knocked at the door, God the Fath- 
er, and Jesus his Son would never 
have come from the portals on high 
in answer to his seeking; this dis- 
pensation would never have been 
opened, had it not been for that 
prayer. My friends, and brothers 
and sisters in the world, if you want 
to know God, seek him : he does 
not push his work upon you, he will 
not force his work upon you — -but 
you must seek him. Very much 
contrary and opposite is the work 
of the evil one — he forces himself 
upon us — we do not have to ask; 
give him half a show and he will 
take a whole show — that is the dif- 
ference. It illustrates that beauti- 
ful law of free agency. If you want 
what is good, seek it, go after it, 
get the development and the ex- 
perience — evil comes of itself. 

On the 15th day of May, 1829, 
as recorded in the revelations writ- 
ten by the prophet, we find these 
words in answer to prayer: "Upon 
you, my fellow servants, in the 
name of the Messiah, I confer the 
priesthood of Aaron." What a 
splendid thing was there given ! 
God showed it was necessary to 
deal in first principles — consequent- 
ly gave that power to Joseph Smith 
and his associates, so that they 
could act in things pertaining to 
godliness; and in the beginning of 
this great work, consequently, they 
received a portion of the power of 
God — but not all of it. 

What was the Priesthood of 
Aaron? In the days of Aaron it 
dealt with the priest's office, things 



pertaining to the temple, pertain- 
ing to the consecrated material 
things. But this priesthood also 
holds the keys and has the right to 
certain spiritual blessings : it holds 
the keys of the ministering of an- 
gels and of the gospel of repent- 
ance. Joseph Smith, like you and 
me, had no right even to call men 
to repentance until God gave him 
the right, and that right came 
through holding the priesthood. 
This priesthood holds the power to 
the keys of the ministering of an- 
gels, preaching the gospel, and 
baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins ; and it shall never 
be taken from the earth until the 
sons of Levi do offer again an of- 
fering in righteousness. 

Brethren and sisters, do we want 
eternal life? Do we want a place 
in the kingdom of our Father? If 
so, we ought to seek for and honor 
the priesthood. Now this may seem 
peculiar to our friends in the world, 
but it is very plain — no man can en- 
ter where God the Father dwells, 
unless he holds the priesthood, and 
he must hold the higher priesthood. 
If we read the 76th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, we find 
there defined three distinct but gen- 
eral classifications of the children 
of men. We sing about seeing God, 
being with our God, but there is 
something required first, the power 
that is the means in our hands to 
reach God, to know of his ways — 
and that power is the priesthood 
delegated to man, which God has 
given in this dispensation. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, 
that every man will know what 
that power means. Does it mean 
anything to you to be able to re- 
buke the influence of the adver- 
sary? If so, it requires that you 



ELDER JOHN A. ELI SON 



109 



possess the Melchizedek priest- 
hood to rebuke that influence. 

If any of you wish to call your 
neighbor or your friend into your 
home to assist in administering to 
any member of your family, and 
through the power and the right 
that you have through that priest- 
hood, ask God to heal your wife Or 
son or your daughter — is that 
worth anything to you? If so, the 
priesthood is valuable to you in 
that respect. You cannot do with- 
out it. 

Is it worth anything to know that 
you can carry a message of truth 
to the nations of the earth? If so, 
you must hold the priesthood, or 
the power of God, to act. 

Is it worth anything to detect the 
power of evil, the adversary? If 
so, that priesthood will help you 
to discern more quickly than any 
other way. Hence, my brethren, 
you should desire to hold the priest- 
hood. 

In other words, is it worth any- 
thing to you to have at your com- 
mand and in your possession the 
means of reaching God and know- 
ing his desires concerning you? If 
so, the priesthood is valuable to 
you, and is that means within your 
command. 

It is useless to say, or sing, or 
preach that we shall dwell with God 
the eternal Father forever and 
ever, and then lie idle. I had an 
experience at one time as bishop 
of a ward. Someone came to my 
home quickly and said, "Will you 
come and administer to my wife? 
She is very low." And I asked the 
nearest elder I could get to accom- 
pany me. He was a seventy, but 
had not been very active in the 
priesthood. He came with me, and 
I asked him to anoint the sick. He 
did so, but said nothing. "Brother," 



I said, "say, 'I anoint you, in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen.' " He said it. We admin- 
istered to the sister, and she was 
restored. I had a good chance to 
instruct the young man afterwards, 
and he saw the need of knowing 
what the uses of priesthood were 
with which God had entrusted him. 

We hear of men being ordained 
elders to go through the temple to 
be married for time and eternity — 
and the object of some of our boys 
seems to be the bride; but the 
greater purpose in being ordained 
is to receive the marvelous power 
of the priesthood. Without it you 
cannot receive the blessings of that 
sacred place ; but some of our 
brethren seem to want that power 
only because, it is necessary to en- 
able them to go through the House 
of the Lord. They little under- 
stand the obligations they assume. 
I believe it is the duty of every 
man who holds this God-given 
power to learn its uses. 

Brethren and sisters, the power 
of God is upon the earth. I hope 
that men holding the priesthood of 
the living God will learn its uses. 
Then the keys of the ministering 
of angels will mean something to 
them, to know the mysteries of the 
kingdom of God will mean some- 
thing to them. I hope that the time 
will come very quickly when our 
boys who hold the lesser priesthood 
will consider it a privilege to go 
into the homes of the people to ex- 
hort them to live right and to pray, 
to expound the Scriptures to them. 
When this great conflict is over 
that we are engaged in, I believe 
that men who hold the full power 
of the priesthood will be needed to 
carry the gospel message to the na- 
tions of the earth. I have always 
been a believer that what God or- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dained for a certain purpose should 
be used for that certain purpose. 
Teachers should be used for teach- 
ing the people at ihome ; priests 
should be used as ministers at 
home. When the lesser priesthood 
comes into its own, I believe that 
ward teaching will be no trouble 
I believe there will be no difficulty 
in it, and men who hold the higher 
priesthood will be carrying the mes- 
sage of life to the souls of men. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints 
and the work they are doing. I re-' 
joice in the fact that I am a mem- 
ber of the Church. There may be 
men and women within the sound 
of my voice who wonder why it is 
that we testify concerning Joseph 
Smith. Well, briefly, this power 
of which I speak, this priesthood 
which the Latter-day Saints have 
in their possession, without which 
man cannot legally act for God, 
came through Joseph. No one repre- 
sented God the Father on earth. In 
fact, men denied revelation, they 
did not want it. Joseph Smith says 
that the door of heaven was opened 
through prayer. God the Father 
appeared, he brought with him his 
Son, and he said, "Joseph, this is 
my beloved Son, hear him." That 
was the first introduction of his 
Son since the days of the apostles 
of old, that God had given to any 
man. And thus this great work be- 
gan. It was followed up by this 
priesthood being restored to men 
upon the earth. And Joseph Smith 
was the instrument in the hands of 
God. He was what the world may 
call a lucky man, but he was lucky 
because he went after luck, and he 
received the answer to his prayer. 
Brethren and sisters, Joseph Smith 
is a prophet of God. President 
Joseph F. Smith said (I believe in 
the November number of the Im- 



provement Era,) concerning Abra- 
ham, Isaac, and Jacob : "They live, 
they are prophets as they were 
prophets, they are patriarchs as 
they were patriarchs. They live, 
and so does Joseph Smith ; he is a 
prophet today, as he was a proph- 
et." He lives, my brethren and 
sisters, and this work is going 
forth. He was the instrument of 
the Lord to begin it in the last 
days, and it will fill the immensity 
of space ; truth shall reign on the 
earth, wickedness shall cease, and 
the world shall know that God lives, 
I testify in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM S. HARRIS. 

(President of the San Luis Stake of 
Zion) 

I will take for a text Jesus' la- 
ment over Jerusalem, "O Jerusa- 
lem, Jerusalem, thou that stonest 
the prophets and killest those that 
are sent unto thee, how often would 
I have gathered thy children to- 
gether, even as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, but ye 
would not. Now your house shall 
be left unto you desolate, until you 
shall say, Blessed is he that cometh 
in the name of the Lord." 

Jesus also said, A tree is known 
by its fruits. "Do men gather grapes 
of thorns or figs of thistles ?" 

I wish to talk to you a few min- 
utes of what the gospel has done 
for the Mexican people, the La- 
manites, the peoples to the south. I 
have been in nearly every state in 
Mexico, and have been in Central 
America, and South America — on 
the River Sidon, .seen the Land of 
Zarahemla — seen many of the hiero- 
glyphics and temples and objects 
of that character, manifesting that 



ELDER HYRUM S. HARRIS 



111 



there has been a great civilization 
on this land of America. 

I had a conversation with one of 
the cabinet officers of President 
Diaz, and took him some of the 
products of the "Mormon" colonies 
in Chihuahua, and I will tell you 
a little of what they did there, the 
fruits of "Mormon" work, and how 
the people to the south esteemed it. 
They are of the blood of Israel, 
and there is not so much enmity 
in their hearts toward us and our 
message as there is in the north, 
for I have preached in both coun- 
tries. 

President Diaz had said, "I have 
robbed your people." And he sent 
an expert, a German, by the way, to 
the colonies to investigate. He 
said, "I have heard so much about 
those people and the work they are 
doing, that I want you to go up 
there secretly. Travel among them, 
visit them, see them in their homes 
there, see how they are worshiping, 
and what they are doing, and come 
to me again and report." 

There was a national fair before 
this in the City of Mexico, and I 
was at that fair. We brought a 
carload of canned fruit, jellies, ap- 
ples, butter, cheese, shoes, harness, 
and quilts, etc. And they gave us 
a prominent place in the show 
grounds, and we had our apples 
beautifully polished and our splen- 
did harnesses and shoes, and every- 
thing first class ; and when the 
Mexican people came in — rich peo- 
ple who had gold and diamonds, 
they opened their eyes and drew up 
their hands. "Where did this come 
from ? This is from Mexico ? No, 
this is from California, or some of 
the best cities in the Union !" 

California never did outdo us in 
fruit-raising. We were equal to 
any fruit country that I ever saw 



in the world — and I never saw any- 
thing nicer than when they came 
up and we distributed those apples, 
nearly a carload of them; and we 
cut our cheese — hundreds of dol- 
lars worth of it, and distributed it 
to those people, and they ate it. And 
everything they saw they marveled 
at, and they went away with praises, 
took the apples and set them on 
the shelves in their offices, and to 
the hundreds and thousands of 
friends that would come there they 
would say, "That was raised in 
Mexico," and they would uplift 
their chins with pride. This is the 
product — what our people are do- 
ing in Mexico. 

I had business with President 
Diaz, and nearly all of his cabinet, 
with Madero — and I have been in 
prison three times, and have had 
the dagger over my head ready to 
let fall. I know the evils as well 
as the good things of the people. 
Now, in this conversation with the 
minister of education, L. Fer- 
nando, a great lawyer, one of the 
leading lawyers of the republic, 
when I took him some fruit and 
jelly and other things that were 
sent to him — for the Church finally, 
through our solicitation, appropri- 
ated $200 or $300 to be distributed 
in gifts to these important people, 
lawyers and statesmen and great 
men of the nation, when I took the 
little gift to him, he said, "Mr. 
Harris, tell me something about 
your people and their social rela- 
tions, for if they can do what I see 
they appear to have done, I want to 
know something about them and 
their system of worship and what 
they are." 

I was a student then at the Na- 
tional School of Jurisprudence. I 
was in the sixth year. I was with 
young men from every part of the

republic, who had come there to 
be lawyers, and to be educated. 
We were studying morality,the laws 
of right and justice, by Spencer 
and the famous German authors 
on morality, and the boys would 
learn by rote the principles of mor- 
ality as discussed by Spencer and 
the leading moralists of the day. I 
was personally acquainted with 
nearly all of the three hundred that 
were in the school, having been 
there so long, and they were im- 
moral, and I knew they were im- 
moral. 

"Now," I told him, "we are 
studying in our school (he knew 
me well) the principles of moral- 
ity ; but Paul says that 'the letter 
killeth, it is the spirit that giveth 
light ;' and morality — the boys can 
give you the rules number 1, 2 and 
3 better than I can, but they go out 
and sin against the laws that they 
are studying and learning ; while 
our little boys, in the Primary As- 
sociation, where they are sent, and 
the most capable, pure women and 
girls in the land take charge each 
week for one hour, learn that they 
have a Father and God in heaven, 
as they have on earth. They are 
taught to pray, to reverence God, 
who has ears to hear and a heart 
that can be touched by the prayers 
and the supplications of the little 
ones. Therefore, faith and spiritu- 
ality is begotten in their little souls. 
After that, they go to their Mu- 
tuals. There the same lessons are 
being taught and reinforced. Thev 
go to their Sunday Schools and 
to their priesthood meetings." I 
outlined the work of each to him, 
then that the young ladies and girls 
on their side have the Young La- 
dies' Association, and the Relief 
Society, and then I outlined the 
work of these. And I said, from 



three points of view they are great, 
because of their physical perfec- 
tion, because of their spiritual, and 
because of their mental strength — 
and the most perfect man must 
combine the three, and he can not 
be converted unless he has each 
one developed. 

Now the world is trying to de- 
velop the intellectual and the phys- 
ical to the detriment of the moral 
and the spiritual, and I say the life 
of morality is spirituality, and with- 
out spirituality there can be no vital 
living morality. We can talk about 
Spencer and all the other theorists, 
but I know and you know, and I 
can bring your whole company of 
students here to bear the same tes- 
timony* that the morality that we 
study without spirituality is dead 
in their lives. 

Now, we teach spirituality to 
our little ones. We teach them 
morality, and teach them to sing 
and pray ; and we not only teach 
them by having others do it, but 
the little ones are called out by 
these young or old women, and 
there they say their prayers. Ev- 
ery one in the association learns to 
pray, and learns to sing. The es- 
thetic part of their nature is de- 
veloped in their singing. Another 
little girl is called up and she re- 
cites. Then they play their little 
games, and are taught to march, to 
straighten up — and their little phys- 
ical natures are developed. 

And I explained these things to 
that great man in the Mexican re- 
public, and when I got up to leave 
— and he was due at a cabinet meet- 
ing with President Diaz — I said, 
"I have talked longer than I 
thought I would — I have talked an 
hour and a half." He did not seem 
to be uneasy, and when I apolo- 
gized, he grabbed me with both 



ELDER E. FRANKLIN BIRCH 



113 



hands and thanked me, and said, 
"You have no need to apologize, 
for the things that I have heard are 
so grand and so great." 

Now I want to say to you that it 
is so with our children, for I am a 
witness. I was in the mission and 
presided over the mission for four 
years. I was the first President of 
the Relief Society in Mexico, and 
we set them to work sewing. We 
organized a little Sunday School, 
and all these associations, and they 
began to work; and today you go 
to their Sunday Schools and their 
little entertainments and hear their 
prayers ; and you go to the Relief 
Society and see what they have 
done; and if you had been there 
you would have seen that the fruits 
are just as uplifting, just as splen- 
did with those Mexicans as they are 
with the Anglo-Saxon, with the 
Germans, with the Americans, or 
any other people on the earth. What 
is it? The gospel has done it, the 
system that we teach and advocate. 

Now, I bear you my testimony 
that I know the gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation, in things 
temporal, spiritual, moral, and phys- 
ical. May we be true to it is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER E. FRANK BIRCH. 

(President of the Tintic Stake of 
Zion) 

My dear friends, I assure you 
that it is a surprise to me to be 
called on here today to speak. It 
reminds me something of a mis- 
sion field to stand before an audi- 
ence in the open air. • 

You who have been on missions 
in the world will recall that many 
times you have been asked if you 
believed in Christ, and you have 



believed in Christ, and you have 
asked, "Then why are you preach- 
ing to us? We also believe in 
Christ. What is the difference be- 
tween your Church and our church ? 
You are Christians and we are 
Christians. Why spend your money 
and your time to preach to us peo- 
ple here?" 

For a moment you wonder, and 
you stop to think. But if you will 
think long enough, you will realize 
the great difference, the wonder- 
ful difference. It has been ex- 
plained here today — the difference 
of service, the difference between 
a Church holding the priesthood 
and a church not holding it. 

There is a quotation in the New 
Testament by Paul to the Corin- 
thians. In it he says, in substance : 
Some of you have the gift of heal- 
ing, some will have the gift of 
prophecy, some of wisdom, some 
one thing, some another. I often 
think of that when I attend the 
meetings of the different churches 
in the world. No reflection — it is 
only a matter of a difference of 
opinion with them — but I often 
think of it, when I see one man 
who prays, one man who preaches, 
one man who blesses, one man who 
dojes all in the church. The rest 
merely stand or sit and listen. 

We know that it is service that 
makes us in this Church. We know 
that this Church gives us an oppor- 
tunity to grow, to serve the Lord, 
to exercise his priesthood. 

I am working at the present time 
at a mining camp, in Tintic. I 
can bear testimony that this prin- 
ciple of service and of the priest- 
hood is making thousands of good 
men and women. We have an op- 
portunity there to meet the younger 
people who come from the "valley 
towns" as we term them, from your 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



city, from other cities in this stake 
and other stakes. They come there 
and the first thing we do, we get 
them to meeting. And they do not 
attend long before they are being 
encouraged to attend to meetings. 
They soon become ward teachers. 
Then you will find them holding the 
higher priesthood, presiding in the 
organizations, bishops of the wards, 
and so on ; they are growing and 
improving. Now I do not exceed 
the truth when I say that we have 
over a thousand at least who are 
keeping the Word of Wisdom, who 
hold prayer in their homes, who 
are good and true to their families, 
who are growing to be intelligent, 
good, true, honorable citizens of the 
United States. And what has done 
it? I can see the greatest thing 
that has done it — service in the 
priesthood, service in the Church. 

When I attend other churches, I 
often think of the young lady who 
was asked if she could play the 
piano. She said she did not know, 
she had never tried. I think of the 
many people in the world. How do 
you know that you have the gift of 
prophecy, as Paul said some have? 
How do you know that you have 
the gift of wisdom, the gift of 
healing, if you never take part? If 
you never try, if you never culti- 
vate those gifts that God has given 
you, you will never know it. 

I rejoiced when I heard today of 
the great work that is being done 
in Mexico and in the mission fields, 
the work done in other stakes, and 
think of the work that is being done 
in the mining camps, in the Tintic 
mining camp. A few years ago 
there were very few Latter-day 
Saints in the Tintic camp. A few 
years ago it was said that they 
could not work there, they would 



not have them ; but our people now 
form thirty-five or forty per cent 
of that population ; and I am thank- 
ful to say that they are preaching 
the gospel by their exemplary lives, 
by their cleanliness, their purity, 
their patriotism to our great gov- 
ernment. And today our people 
are requested, almost more than 
they can attend to, to look after the 
great things that need looking after 
during these extraordinary times. 

I thank the Lord that I have the 
privilege to speak to the people on 
the principles of life and salvation, 
and rejoice in the greatness of the 
gospel. I pray God to bless the 
Latter-day Saints, bless the honest 
in heart the world over, and I ask 
it in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

By brethren and sisters: You 
have had the privilege of hear- 
ing fron men whom God has 
chosen in this dispensation to rep- 
resent a number of the stakes of 
Zion, and also a voice from the 
mission field. I think that you 
must have been impressed as I have 
been impressed, that all is well with 
Zion when such men with such tes- 
timonies are in the lead and guiding 
and directing the affairs of this 
Church. I rejoice this morning in 
the testimonies which we have 
heard, in the work that is being 
done, for I know that it is indeed 
the work of God. I know, too, 
that the work of God is one that 
harmonizes with the spirit of hu- 
man liberty, as was stated by the 
first speaker here. 

What are the things that the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ stands 
for? It is to make men free, not 



ELDER RULEN S. WELLS 



115 



free only by having possession of 
their civil rights, but to make them 
free indeed, free from that terrible 
bondage which is the bondage of 
sin — for we know that the whole 
world lieth in sin and under the 
bondage of sin. And the truth that 
has been revealed from heaven will 
make men free. And it is that 
truth that is being promulgated and 
proclaimed to all the world through 
the agency of the priesthood to 
which also reference has been 
made. The men whom you have 
heard form a part of that, and are 
the instruments in the hands of God 
of carrying this messag^ to the 
world, that our Father's children 
may be made free from the sins of 
the world. And the gospel is the 
power of God unto salvation, be- 
cause it wages war on sin and un- 
dertakes to relieve our Father's 
children of the consequences of 
that sin. 

This government of which we 
form a part has been established 
for the same purpose, that men and 
women might be free, and that is 
the reason we say that the Consti- 
tution of this land was inspired of 
God for the same purpose, that we 
might have meted out to us a meas- 
ure of civil liberty. That is what 
we are enjoying in this country, 
and we are willing to extend it to 
all of our Father's children, wher- 
ever they dwell. We read in the 
Declaration of Independence that 
all men are created equal, and that 
they are possessed with certain in- 
alienable rights-, among which are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap- 
piness. This is what the gospel 
stands for. Right to live upon the 
earth is the boon from heaven, 
which emanates from God, the priv- 
ilege of living upon the earth. That 



is life, but what is life without lib- 
erty? Our great patriot, Patrick 
Henry, said, "Give me liberty, or 
give me death." That is what we 
feel in regard to this system of hu- 
man liberty and freedom. These 
things may not be valued by those 
who understand them not, they 
think it is a trifling thing, but to 
us these are precious gifts worthy of 
offering our lives and sending our 
boys out into the mission field for. 
Then let our hearts go out with 
them and let us be willing to do our 
part to sustain them, to provide 
them with the necessaries, and let 
us contribute of our means. 

We are called upon to contrib- 
ute to the Third Liberty Loan, and 
there are some with plenty of means 
who are loath to lend to the Gov- 
ernment. Let me tell you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, every one of us, 
the time will come when we must 
give all that we are able to get (or 
at least loan it). Which would 
you sooner do? Lend it to the 
United States Government, that 
has been established by the inspira- 
tion of God that men might be 
free, or pay it in tribute to the Ger- 
man government without getting 
any interest on it, that you might 
be brought into servitude? Which 
would you do? One or the other 
will come to us, you may be sure. 
Let us then be loyal American cit- 
izens, and contribute freely to this 
Liberty Loan by subscribing to the 
bonds of this government that holds 
up the banner of liberty to all the 
world, the precious thing that the 
gospel stands for. May the Lord 
help us to appreciate it, I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Captain C. M. Hawser, of Georgia.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
o'clock p. m., Elder J. Golden Kim- 
ball, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty, presiding. 

The singing and music were fur- 
nished by the united choirs of the 
Granite stake of Zion, Professor 
Evan Stephens, conducting. 

The choirs and congregation 
sang: "America." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Rod- 
ney C. Badger. 

The choirs and congregation 
sang: "Loyal to the true and the 
right." 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of the California Mission) 

In the remarks made by Elder 
David O. McKay this morning, he 
stated that "the hour and the day 
have come when the nations of the 
earth must accept the reality of 
Jesus the Christ." He summarized 
the reading of some books with the 
statement that men believe that 
Jesus is an etherial, incorporeal 
spirit, not a personality. In other 
words, that even Jesus Christ who 
tabernacled in the flesh among the 
children of men, has become a prin- 
ciple or a spirit, such as they have 
contended that God the Father is. 

I take it that they may be par- 
doned in a way for not being able 
to account for some of the passages 
of scripture, namely, of St. John's 
wherein he says that "God is a 
Spirit," and that we must "Worship 
him in spirit and in truth." An- 
other of Paul's statements, wherein 
he says that "there is one God, who 



is above all, and over all, and in 
you all, and through all," and a 
statement of the Master's that "the 
kingdom of God is within you." 
Because of these statements they 
sometimes spiritualize, possibly God 
himself, more than they otherwise 
would have done. One of the 
greatest labors upon us in the mis- 
sion field is to harmonize the state- 
ment that God is a personal being 
with his divine immanence. Hav- 
ing been created in the form of 
God ; knowing that he walked and 
talked with Adam in Eden's gar- 
den ; that he taught Adam how to 
prune the vine and dress it ; in- 
structed Noah in the art of ship- 
building; dined with Abraham on 
the plains of Mamre ; wrestled with 
Jacob, and gave him a name so 
pregnant with big results or bless- 
ings, namely that he was not a 
usurper, as Jacob indicates, but 
"Israel," one who had prevailed 
among princes with the Most 
High ; his meeting with Moses, 
speaking with him face to face as 
one man speaks with another, and 
not in dark sayings ; being beheld 
by five hundred elders and others ; 
announcing his pleasure in the bap- 
tism of his Son at Jordan's flood ; 
speaking of him again upon the 
mount of transfiguration ; and re- 
vealing himself anew in this dis- 
pensation to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith — to us is sufficient testimony 
that God is a personal being. 

It is true that Paul said of the 
Christ that he is "the express image 
of his Father's person," and the 
Master himself said, that "he who 
hath seen me hath seen the Father." 
The Christ was born of woman, as 
men are born in the flesh. He grew 
up as children grow up to man- 
hood. He suffered the distress and 



JOSEPH E. ROBINSON 



117 



pains of mortality, and was taunted 
by the physicians of his day be- 
cause he healed not himself as he 
healed others and raised the dead 
to life. He was spat upon, smit- 
ten and crucified as a malefactor, as 
other men have been misused, 
abused and put to death. 

One of the procurators of Judea, 
Publius Lentulus, writing to the 
Senate of Rome, describes the 
Christ, his form, his person, the 
color of his beard, his eyes, said 
he was accounted as a prophet of 
truth among his followers and a 
man of exceeding 'worth among 
the Gentiles, and he speaks of him 
as a man with divine power : and 
so to the people of that day he 
seemed a man among men, except 
to those who believed in his divine 
begetting. It was aftefr his tri- 
umphant ascension from the tomb, 
when the bands of death had been 
broken, when he stood before his 
disciples as an immortalized being, 
that they came to know him for a 
verity, as the living Son of God. 
He stood in the midst of his breth- 
ren, and they were afrighted at 
first, thinking they had seen a spir- 
it, but he told them to put forth 
their hands and touch him, and he 
assured them that it was he, even 
the Christ, and invited them to 
handle him and said, " a spirit 
hath not flesh and bones as ye see 
me have. "He even partook of 
broiled fish and honey with them, 
convincing them that he had again 
taken up his body from the grave. 
He ascended into heaven, and the 
angels, who stood by, declared that 
as he ascended, so in like manner 
should he descend. And John, the 
beloved, said, "We know not what 
manner of men we shall be, but 
when he comes we shall see him as 
he is, and we shall be like him." 



This doctrine is confirmed in the 
minds of the Latter-day Saints, and 
of many other people, that Jesus is 
not a spirit in the sense that he is 
"incomprehensible," as the creed of 
the fathers declared, that he is not 
diffused throughout all space, but 
that he is an individual and not a 
spirit merely, as so often taught in 
the philosophies of men. 

I cannot hope in the few brief 
moments that should be mine to 
make a full exposition of this truth. 
But I want to read to you a little 
from the gospel of St. John, and 
then, without reading, quote some 
of the revelations given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, in this day 
which enable us by the light of 
truth to harmonize these two prin- 
ciples that seem paradoxical or op- 
posed one to the other. 

John tells us : 

In the beginning was the Word, 
and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God. The same was in 
the beginning with God. All things 
were made by him; and without him 
was not anything made that was 
made. In him was life; and the life 
was the light of men. And the light 
shineth in darkness; and the darkness 
comprehended it not. 

In "Elijah," rendered so beauti- 
fully by the tabernacle choir, we 
read the following words, from 
the Book of Kings, modified a lit- 
tle by the poet to suit the rhythm 
and melody of music : 

Behold, God the Lord passed by, 
and a mighty wind rent the mountains 
asunder, and break in pieces the 
rocks, and they passed before the 
Lord, but yet the Lord was not in 
the tempest. Behold, God the Lord 
passed by, and the sea was upheaved, 
and the earth was shaken; but yet 
the Lord was not in the earthquake. 
And after the earthquake there came 
a fire, and yet the Lord was not in 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the fire. And after the fire there 
came a still small voice, and in that 
still small voice .onward came the 
Lord. 

Men have declared that God is 
found in the blade of grass, in the 
flowers that bud and blow, in the 
rivers and in the rills ; that his 
voice is heard in the thunder-bolt, 
and that he is found in all ani- 
mate and inanimate nature. But 
here in the Book of Kings, we read 
that he was not in the tempest, he 
was not in the earthquake, he was 
not in the fire, but in the still small 
voice. • 

I have read to you the key that 
will harmonize the statement that 
God is through all things and in 
all things, and that he is a personal 
being. He was the "life and the 
light of men," and the Prophet 
Joseph tells us that in his divine im- 
manence "it is the light of Christ," 
the light of truth, that it is in the 
sun and in the moon and in the 
stars, that permeates throughout all 
space, and even the stars of other 
universes than ours are lighted by 
his spirit, and "his curtains are 
stretched out still." That light that 
is millions of years coming to us 
from some distant sun is the "light 
of Christ" as much as it is the light 
of men. His spirit is through all 
things, he hath made all things, he 
was the Word in the beginning, and 
was made flesh and dwelt amongst 
men; he is the life and the light of 
men. This the Latter-day Saint 
understands. 

To illustrate it in its immensity 
and wondrous glory and beauty is 
beyond my power; and yet, here 
in this building, during the night 
hours, we have the light from these 
arc lamps that light up the entire 
section of the building. And yet 



it is not the light itself that perme- 
ates the room ; it is not the sun 
itself that comes to us today 
through the clouds, and makes it 
possible for us to behold each oth- 
er's countenances, but it is the light 
of the sun, not the sun itself. And 
so it is with the light of Christ 
that is in the sun and in the moon 
and in the stars and in all things — 
"in them all and through them all," 
and by which all things are made 
and are sustained. And when men 
of the world understand this divine 
truth, there will not be the trouble 
that exists now in harmonizing the 
statement that God is a personal 
being and that God is a Spirit as 
well. 

May the Lord guide us to his 
praise, enlighten us by his Spirit, 
give us the courage and faith to 
.walk in his paths, and set our affec- 
tions upon the things of eternal 
worth, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES W. LESUEUR. 

(President of the Maricopa Stake of 
Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I pray 
for the Spirit of the Lord while I 
shall speak to you. It was forty- 
one years ago, on the 17th of last 
March, when the colonists first 
went to the Maricopa stake of Zion, 
sent by the President of the Church 
to do missionary work among the 
Indians. I thoug'ht this afternoon 
it might be of interest to you to 
know what the Church is doing for 
the Indians in Arizona. 

We have living in our stake some 
three hundred members who are 
Indians. We have two missions 
there, with headquarters. The 



JAMES W. LESUEUR 



119 



Church is very liberal in helping 
these good people. Our mission- 
aries go out among these Indians 
and work with them on the farm, 
helping them to prepare the ground 
for the purtting in of their crops, 
building their homes, and in pro- 
viding for them the necessary seed, 
and the materials with which to 
build their homes. We get splen- 
did results, for they are a good 
people. I doubt if in all the Church 
there are any who live their religion 
more strictly than do the Lamanites 
of the Maricopa stake of Zion. At 
one time we had a bishop who did 
not keep the word of wisdom, who 
was in charge of these Indians. He 
reported at one of the conferences 
that he was the only person in his 
ward who did not keep the word of 
wisdom. — Brother Kimball wants 
to know what we did with him. 
He was released. 

We have in our stake a high 
councilor who is a Lamanite. We 
have an Indian who is a superin- 
tendent of Sunday schools, and a 
very faithful brother. We have also 
a number of Indians who are faith- 
ful missionaries, and these faithful 
Lamanites have done 100 per cent 
ward teaching, and their average 
attendance at their sacrament meet- 
ings is over 50 per cent. 

A good work is also being done 
among the Indians in our stake, at 
the Indian school. The govern- 
ment of the United States has per- 
mitted us, with the other churches, 
to have our Indian children twice 
a week, and preach the gospel to 
them. The children are all brought 
into a main building, where the 
different churches have the priv- 
ilege of teaching their own children 
twice a week. This was at the so- 
licitation of our people. We are 



doing a great deal of good among 
them in that way. 

Our people have known of these 
tribes of Indians in Arizona for a 
great many years. When the boys 
of the "Mormon" Battalion made 
their historic march from Santa Fe 
to the coast they met some of these 
Indians, and learned something 
about them. 

In our stake, too, we have evi- 
dences of the divine authenticity 
of the Book of Mormon. We have 
there the ruins of a great city, 
probably at one time fifteen miles 
wide and thirty or forty miles long. 
And that immense Salt River valley 
was once peopled by the Nephites 
with a larger population than occu- 
pies it today. Just a mile from 
Mesa are the ruins of great build- 
ings which those people erected. 
There is a building 450 feet long' 
by 350 feet wide. I estimate that 
it had at least a thousand rooms 
when it was being used, and around 
this building are the signs of a great 
wall that used to protect it. 

When our people went to the 
Salt River valley forty-one years 
ago, the people were poor, and un- 
able to get the water out. But they 
found the signs of a great canal 
those Nephites had used. They 
cleaned out that canal for twelve 
miles, made a dam across the river, 
and turned the water out on to the 
thirsty soil, and for a number of 
years our people had the use of 
that canal. Then the government 
came and built the great Roosevelt 
canal. But after careful, scientific 
investigation by the best engineers, 
this old Nephite canal was found 
to be built just where it should be, 
and was followed. There are parts 
even now of the Salt River valley 
that are not being irrigated which 



120

were used by those Nephite people 
in times past. 

The Indians of the Salt River 
valley have traditions of the time 
when there was a great flood. They 
point you to the great mountain, 
the Superstition mountain, and they 
say that is the place where a great 
boat landed when the flood was 
over the earth, and a bird was sent 
out, and brought from that moun- 
tain twigs, and the boat was steered 
that way and landed on that moun- 
tain. Then the water receded from 
both sides of the mountain, and left 
only two streams, one the Salt 
River on the north, and the Gila 
River on the south. They have 
traditions of a time when the Su- 
preme Being was among them, do- 
ing a wonderful work, and they 
look forward to his coming again. 
A great many statements of the 
Book of Mormon in regard to the 
history of their forefathers are 
borne out by their traditions. 

I take great joy in laboring 
among these Lamajiite brethren 
and sisters, and there are some ten 
or twelve thousand of them in Ari- 
zona. 

The people of Arizona are very 
friendly to the Latter-day Saints. 
Not long ago, when we were in the 
prohibition campaign, they asked 
us to go and give talks in Phoenix 
on prohibition. During a talk to a 
great audience there some one 
spoke up and asked about one of 
the apostles. 

I thanked him for calling atten- 
tion to the fact that I was a "Mor- 
mon," for I told them that if there 
was anything I was proud of it was 
the fact that I am a "Mormon." 
And I told them that the Latter- 
day Saints have what they call the 
Word of Wisdom, that they do 



not believe in using liquor, tea, cof- 
fee or tobacco. What is the re- 
sult? In Arizona, out of 469 in- 
mates in the insane asylum, we had 
two, while in proportion to popula- 
tion, we should have twenty. I 
told them that one of the chief rea- 
sons for that was that we are a 
moral and a temperate people and 
we keep the Word of Wisdom. Out 
of 169 in the penitentiary we had 
but one who claimed a membership 
in the Church, while in proportion 
we should have nineteen or twenty. 
In the industrial school we had 
none ; at the poor farm none ; in 
the various hospitals we had none. 
Hence, I told them that I was proud 
that I am a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I also told them the fact, 
that the birth-rate among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints compared with the 
death rate was five births to one 
death, while the statistics of the 
state the pervious year showed a 
very much smaller proportion of 
births. I told them they ought to be 
thankful that the Latter-day Saints 
saved the state. There would have 
been more deaths than births if we 
had not been there. So I had the 
privilege of giving my testimony in 
regard to the vital statistics of the 
people. 

I am proud to be a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and I pray God to bless 
us all that we may be faithful and 
true, which I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A duet, entitled, "Make the home 
beautiful," was sung by Margaret 
and Lillian Summerhays, the sing- 
ing being preceded by a brief ex- 
planatory of the song by Professor 
Stephens.

ELDER WILLARD L. JONES. 

(President of the Moapa Stake of 
Zion) 

It is in humility, my brethren 
and sisters, that I stand before you 
for a few moments, this afternoon, 
and I trust that the spirit of truth 
will direct my utterances while 1 
am here. 

i I am grateful for the opportunity 
I have of attending the general 
conference of the Church, coming 
here and listening to the testimo- 
nies of President Smith and of the 
leading brethren who are associ- 
ated with him, who are the lead- 
ers of the Latter-day Saints. I es- 
teem, khis a great privilege, 'my 
brethren and sisters, and I rejoice 
that I can come here and worship 
the Lord with you, and partake 
with you of the Spirit of the Lord 
enjoyed upon these occasions. 

I am grateful for the testimony 
that I have concerning the great 
Latter-day work and its divinity, 
and I pray that it shall be an abid- 
ing one. I hope and pray that my 
ligjit in life during the remainder 
of my sojourn upon the earth shall 
be among the Latter-day Saints, be- 
cause I love the truth. I love the 
associations of my brethren and 
sisters. I love the association of 
those whom the Lord has called to 
preside over his people. 

I believe that if there has ever 
been a soul who spoke as one hav- 
ing authority, it is the President of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, the man who stands 
at the head of this great work at 
the present time. I believe that he 
is indeed the servant of the true and 
living God. I believe also that the 
Presidency, the Twelve, and the 
seven presidents of Seventy are 



men after the Lord's • own 
heart, who have been chosen to 
direct his work in the earth. I 
rejoice in listening to the words of 
encouragement and instruction 
from these our beloved brethren, 
and I am thankful that I have been 
born of goodly parents, who in their 
own native land had sufficient faith 
to come to these valleys of the 
mountains, and that as their son I 
have been privileged to be reared 
in the gospel covenant. I pray that 
I may always be found doing the 
things which are right and pleasing 
before our Maker. 

I am reminded of a saying of 
President Lincoln. During a crit- 
ical time that confronted him and 
the Nation, some clergymen came 
into his office, and in conversation 
with him one of them said : "Mr. 
President,' do you think that the 
Lord is upon our side?" Presi- 
dent Lincoln replied to this effect : 
"That is not a matter that con- 
cerns me so much ; but the thing 
that concerns me most of all is, 
are we upon the Lord's side?" I 
think that that statement can be 
applied to us as Latter-day Saints. 
I think the thing that concerns us 
most of all, as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is, Are we upon the 
Lord's side ? We have been brought 
into the Church, we have had faith 
in the Lord Jesus Christ, we have 
repented of our sins, and have gone 
down into the waters of baptism, 
and have had hands laid upon our 
heads for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost. We have entered that 
straight and narrow path that will 
lead men back unto the Father. 
Having done this, it is for us to fol- 
low the admonitions given : add to 
our faith virtue ; and to virtue, 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



knowledge ; and to knowledge, tem- 
perance, and to temperance, broth- 
erly kindness. The apostle says 
that if these things abound in us 
then we will not be barren nor un- 
fruitful. But, further, he that lack- 
eth these things is blind and cannot 
see afar off, and he has forgotten 
that he has been purged of his own 
sins. So, in our lives, if we under- 
take to follow the path which the 
Lord has marked out for us, and 
fail to follow after the admonitions 
of our leaders, I feel then that we 
are on a path that leads to destruc- 
tion, and are not on the Lord's side. 
But if we are continually adding to 
our faith works, doing those things 
that the Lord points out for us, 
then I believe we may feel that we 
are on the Lord's side. As we are 
told in the old scriptures, the Lord's 
arm is not short, that he will not 
save, nor his ear heavy that he will 
not hear, but if you are divided 
from your God it is because of your 
iniquities. So it is with us. 

I bear witness to you that if we 
are faithful, and not ashamed of 
the gospel of Christ, but will bear 
witness of the truth of this great 
work, as we have opportunity from 
time to time, the Lord will hear 
our prayers, inasmuch as we ask 
not amiss. 

I remember one of the brethren 
attending our conference some time 
ago relating an instance of a man 
who had lived among our people 
most of his life, and upon his death 
bed the elders of the Church were 
called upon to administer cheer and 
the necessaries of life unto him. In 
the course of their conversation 
they related to him the mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, the gos- 
pel of the Redeemer, and what the 



Latter-day Saints were endeavor- 
ing to accomplish in;, ithe /fearth. 
Though this man had lived among 
our people most of his life, he had 
never known our doctrines, hav- 
ing never taken advantage of listen- 
ing to the servants of the Lord. 
Neither had the brethren and sisters 
who were his associates taken ad- 
vantage of their opportunities to 
explain to him the principles of 
truth. And this man, upon his 
deathbed, demanded of them the 
reason why they had not been faith- 
ful and diligent in warning him and 
others who were in similar condi- 
tion, of the judgments that were to 
come and of the blessings that were 
in store for those who obey the 
commandments of the Father ! I 
wonder if there are others among 
us who are in a similar condition. 
I wonder if we are neglecting our 
opportunities and failing to teach 
our brethren and sisters not of our 
faith, of the blessings that are in 
store for them, provided they ac- 
cept the gospel and live according 
to its teachings. I feel that many 
times we neglect the responsibili- 
ties placed upon us. Not that we 
are ashamed of the work that the 
Lord has given us, because I be- 
lieve there are not many of us who 
are afraid to bear our testimonies 
concerning the prophet Joseph 
Smith, or who are afraid to speak 
of the gospel, and of the great work 
that the Latter-day Saints are en- 
deavoring to accomplish in the 
earth. But in some instances we 
are negligent and careless towards 
our neighbors who know not of the 
blessings in store for them pro- 
vided they accept the truth. 

So I pray we will avail ourselves 
of the opportunities God has given 



ELDER WILLARD L. JONES. 



123 



us, that we may rid our garments 
of the blood of all men, and when 
we shall appear before our Maker, 
we will have done our duty toward 
the children of men; having ex- 
plained upon every available and 
proper occasion the message of 
eternal truth, that men everywhere 
may be left without excuse in the 
day of the coming of the Lord. 

You remember the responsibility 
placed upon one of the prophets in 
olden times, referred to by Ezekiel 
the prophet. The word of the Lord 
to that prophet was to this effect: 
"Son of man, I have set thee a 
watchman over the house of Israel ; 
therefore thou shalt hear the word 
of the Lord at my mouth, and warn 
them from me. When I say unto 
the wicked, thou shalt surely die, 
if thou dost not speak to warn the 
wicked of his way, that wicked man 
shall die in his iniquity; but his 
blood will I require at thy hand. 
Nevertheless, if thou warn the 
wicked of his way to turn from it, 
if he do not turn from his way he 
shall die in his iniquity, but thou 
hast delivered thy soul." I believe 
that these words can be applied to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and to the members 
thereof. 

Any one can bear testimony that 
the leaders of this people are tak- 
ing advantage of their opportunity 
to send men to go out and officiate 
in the name of the Lord for the 
benefit and the salvation of (tone 
souls of men. 

I rejoice in such a work, and that 
I am a member of a Church that is 
looking after the interests of my 
soul and your soul and my neigh- 
bor's soul. The leaders of this peo- 



ple are going from the north to 
the south, and from the east to the 
west, organizing- the people into 
stakes, wards and branches, and 
bringing about the purposes of the 
Lord. Everywhere responsibility 
is being placed upon men and 
women, and the people are being 
warned that this is the day of re- 
pentance. I hope and pray that we 
shall always be proud of the name 
that we bear among the children 
of men. 

I well remember the words of 
President B.' H. Roberts, in his last 
speech before Congress, when he 
had been denied his seat there. He 
said : "I shall walk the earth with 
head erect, and with brow undaunt- 
ed.'' These words to me are most 
beautiful, and I think they should 
enter deep into the minds of the 
Latter-day Saints, the sentiment 
that they will walk the earth proud 
of the name that they have among 
the children of men, proud that 
they are members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I thank the Lord for the organi- 
zation of the Church, and for 
prophets and apostles to lead Israel, 
and that we are trying to keep the 
commandments of the Lord. I re- 
joice always in the truth. I have a 
testimony that God lives, that Jesus 
Christ was indeed his Son, that 
Joseph Smith was indeed the 
prophet of the true and living God, 
and that the men who preside over 
the Church are men called of God 
to lead this people in the dispen- 
sation of the fulness of times. I 
pray that we shall be true unto the 
sacred covenants we have made, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER EDWARD C. RICH. 

(President of the Bear Lake Stake of 
Zion who was introduced by Presi- 
dent J. G. Kimball as a son of 
Joseph C. Rich, and a grandson of 
the late Elder Charles C. Rich, of 
the Council of Twelve.) 

I trust that the Lord will bless 
me while I stand before you. I re- 
joiced in listening to the opening 
song, "America." It made me feel 
proud that I am an American, the 
citizen of a country which stands 
for all that is good in a govern- 
mental way, — 'for right, justice, and 
liberty, and these principles will ex- 
tend from this government to all 
the world. 

I am also proud that I am a 
member of this Church, the Church 
of Christ, and partaker of the obli- 
gations that have been placed upon 
this Church by the Lord. To know 
the way in which these obligations 
have been carried out makes me 
feel proud of my calling and of my 
Church and people. Jesus said, 
this gospel shall be preached as a 
witness unto all nations, and then 
shall the end come. From the very 
beginning the Church has sensed 
the obligations resting upon it. 
They have sent missionaries to 
every land and clime, both in their 
poverty and in their prosperity. 
They have faithfully observed this 
admonition of the Lord. 

I am thankful to have had the 
opportunity of raising my voice in 
defense of the principles of the gos- 
pel, both upon the streets and in 
the assemblies of this land, and also 
in foreign lands. I feel that the 
Lord has blessed us, and if we are 
faithful he will continue to bless 
us. But if we neglect to observe 
what has been commanded us to do, 
we shall suffer for that. It means 



that each one of us is given respon- 
sibilities. Certain thing's we must 
perform. We must preach this 
gospel to the world, not only by 
precept but by example. There is 
something for those who are left 
at home to accomplish. We can 
preach the gospel by living up to 
its principles and its precepts. These 
will sanctify the earth. Jesus said, 
no man can see the kingdom of God 
unless he is born again, of the 
water and of the spirit. It matters 
not what we may think ; we must 
abide by these teachings. We must 
receive a birth of the water and of 
the spirit in order to enter into the 
kingdom of heaven. And if it is 
necessary for us, it is necessary for 
every creature to comply with this 
statement of Jesus, and with the 
obligations which he placed upon 
his twelve apostles. After he had 
been crucified and risen from the 
dead, and associated with them for 
forty days, the last commission he 
gave them was to go into all the 
world and preach the gospel to 
every creature ; he that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved, and 
he that believeth not shall be 
damned. 

These requirements rest upon 
this Church today, as it has ever 
rested upon the Church : to pro- 
claim faith in God, repentance from 
sin, baptism by immersion for the 
remission of sins, and confirmation 
into the Church and the reception 
of the Holy Ghost by the laying on 
of hands. These are some of the 
observances and principles of the 
gospel necessary for each one of us 
to receive in order to be saved in 
the kingdom of God. As we hope 
for that salvation, it is necessary 
also that all other people must ac- 
cept the same conditions. They 



ELDER EDWARD C. RICH. 



125 



must receive the same principles 
that we observe. Not only is it 
necessary that we comply with 
these principles, but it is also nec- 
essary that we follow Jesus even 
as he required of the rich man who 
came to him and asked him what it 
was necessary for him to -do to be 
saved. He told him to go and sell 
all that he had, and give it to the 
poor, and come, follow him. We 
think sometimes we are absolved 
from serving the Lord. We think 
sometimes that we have accom- 
plished all that is necessary for our 
salvation, but there will never be 
a time while we live upon the earth 
that we are not required to do 
something. We must add to our 
faith virtue, and to virtue knowl- 
edge, and to knowledge, patience, 
and to patience godliness, and to 
godliness brotherly kindness. 

We must add to our lives these 
saving principles of the gospel, and 
observe them, and then teach them 
to our fellows. These are a few 
obligations that rest upon us as 
members of the Church. The na- 
tions of the earth must hear them 
and receive them, or be condemned 
by them. When the disciples of 
Jesus asked him, Master, are there 
few that be saved? he said, Enter 
into the straight gate, for maay 
shall try and not be able. I wonder 
why it is if they are desirous of 
entering the kingdom of God that 
they will not be able to do so. If 
in our hearts we feel that the bless- 
ings of the Lord shall come to us, 
and we desire them with all of our 
hearts, I feel that they will come to 
us. To my mind, the reason they 
will not enter in is because they 
will not live up to the requirements 
of the gospel. 

I don't believe that we can make 



any sacrifice for life eternal. Some 
of our seeming sacrifices are only 
privileges that come to us. The 
calls that come to us to perform 
missions, — are they not glorious 
privileges to us, and not sacrifices? 
And so in our work at home. And 
if we are faithful and true, the 
Lord will bless us because of our 
fidelity to the truth, because we 
love him by keeping his command- 
ments. And that is the only way 
that we can show our love to our 
Creator. He says, if ye love me 
keep my commandments. 

I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord may attend the Latter-day 
Saints wherever they may be. 
Every part of my being testifies to 
me of the truth of this gospel. I 
am proud that my father and 
mother were members of this 
Church, and taught the gospel to 
me, and that my grandfather and 
grandmother were members of this 
Church, and that they were not 
afraid of the hardships incident to 
the settlement of this state. I am 
proud of these facts, and I want to 
maintain their good name in the 
earth. I don't know how it can be 
done better than by keeping the 
commandments of God, by serving 
him, and accepting the principles 
of the gospel that our fathers g'ave, 
and for which they suffered so 
much. 

I will conclude by quoting the 
sayings of our Savior : "Whoso- 
ever heareth these .sayings of mine 
and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his 
house upon a rock ; and the rain de- 
scended, and the floods came, and 
the winds blew and beat upon that 
house, and it fell not, for it was 
built upon a rock. And every one 
that heareth these sayings of mine, 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and doeth them not, shall be likened 
unto a foolish man, which built his 
house upon the sand ; and the rain 
descended, and the floods came, and 
the wind,s blew and beat upon that 
house, and it fell, and great was 
the fall thereof." 

I pray that those of us who have 
received the gospel will maintain it 
all our lives, by our actions and by 
all that we have. I don't know of 
any Church in the world that de- 
mands so much from its members 
as does this Church, in time, means 
and talents. On the other hand, 
there is no Church in the world 
that gives so much in return as does 
this Church. It gives us joy and 
happiness here, and eternal life in 
the world to come. 

I pray that these blessings may 
be for each and every one of us, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred duet, entitled, "Stay 
thou with me," was sung - by Myrtle 
W. Doelle, and Joseph Kjar. 

ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD. 

(President of the North Davis Stake 
of ZionO 

The lateness of the hour and the 
presence on the stand of other 
brethren that the people like to hear, 
and that I feel .should be heard by 
this congregation, admonish me 
that I should occupy but a very few 
moments, indeed, this afternoon. I 
do want to bear testimony, how- 
ever, as to my feelings. I have 
never felt more grateful in my life 
for the knowledge that I have of 
the gospel than I feel today. 

I can scarcely conceive of the 
feelings of the man who has no 
faith in God, and no belief in reve- 
lation and in prophecy, when he 



views the calamitous condition of 
the world today, without that hope 
that comes to the heart of the be- 
liever. 

This is a day, my brethren and 
sisters, when more prophecy is be- 
ing fulfilled, perhaps, in a given 
space of time than has ever been 
known to be fulfilled in the history 
of the world before. I speak not 
only of the prophecies that have 
been uttered and written predict- 
ing the establishment of the Church 
of which we are proud to be mem- 
bers, although these prophecies are 
among the most important that 
have ever been uttered by men un- 
der the inspiration of the Spirit of 
Gorl. These prophecies are being 
fulfilled, and have been fulfilled in 
the establishment and building up 
of this Church, all the time, from 
the first manifestation unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, in the spring 
of 1820, that marvelous manifesta- 
tion which made clear unto men 
again that God lives, and that his 
Son Jesus Christ lives, and that 
both are in the likeness of men, or 
rather that man is in the likeness of 
the Father. Xo greater revelation 
can come to man than that ; for 
"this is life eternal, that they might 
know thee, the only true God, and 
Testis Christ, whom thou hast sent." 
If I had time I should like to dwell 
upon that but as it is I shall only 
say that any man who receives the 
testimony, that God is a perfected 
man thereby is inspired, to fashion 
his life, his being, like unto that of 
his Father. That great manifesta- 
tion has taught us the truth about 
our Father, and has thus pointed 
the way to our perfection. 

The very fact that we are in this 
building, assembled here upon the 
tops of the mountains, organized 



ELDER HENRY H. BLOOD. 



127 



and established here, is proof of the 
fulfilment of another great predic- 
tion that is recorded in the book of 
Isaiah. The fact that we have been 
gathered from every nation under 
heaven and brought here, that we 
have been taught the ways of the 
Lord, to walk in his paths, are all 
in fulfilment of predictions that 
have been made. 

We did not come here to gain 
ease in life, nor to amass wealth. 
We came here for the purpose, and 
so did our parents, of learning the 
ways of the Lord and training our- 
selves in righteous living: and if 
we are failing in that we are fail- 
ing in everything. It matters not 
how much we may acquire of this 
world's goods, we are failures in 
the .eyes of God unless we are living 
according to his commandments. 

Then there are other predictions 
that have been fulfilled and are be- 
ing fulfilled. This condition of war 
and strife in the world that exists 
today has been predicted, and 
the world has been warned and 
forewarned by the Lord of its com- 
ing, for it is true that "surely the 
Lord God will do nothing but he 
revealeth his secret unto his ser- 
vants the prophets." We have been 
called out of the world, and the 
world has been warned that the time 
was coming when war should be 
poured out upon all nations, when 
everybody that was wicked and 
would not repent should feel the 
wrath of God upon them. These 
things are coming to pass and, as I 
said in the commencement, there 
has never been a time since the 
beginning of the world when 
so many important predictions were 
being fulfilled except at the time 
when the Savior came into the 
world as its Redeemer. 



How are we preparing ourselves 
for the part we are to take in the re- 
generation that is to come after 
this great war has passed and has 
scourged the people? I know this 
Church has a mission to perform, 
and I know that it has been estab- 
lished for a wise purpose. The 
Lord expects us, this people, to as- 
sist in regenerating the world and 
in re-establishing conditions that 
are better than they have been 
before. More righteousness must 
be in the world. Men and 
women must learn to acknowl- 
edge God. They must know him, 
and they must receive a testimony 
as to his attributes and being from 
those who know. Here in the val- 
leys of the mountains a great peo- 
ple, a multitude of men and wom- 
en, can stand up and testify, in all 
soberness and solemnity, that they 
know that God lives, that he is not 
an essence merely, not merely a 
spirit, but that he is a being and a 
personage of body and spirit com- 
bined. This knowledge will go out 
into the world, and will spread 
among the children of men. There 
will ultimately be established a 
brotherhood that will give to the 
world an everlasting peace. 

I pray that a testimony of the 
truth and value of the gospel may 
be with us all, that we may be clean 
and pure and virtuous, observing 
that closing article of our faith that 
so beautifully portrays what we 
should be, wherein it says : "We 
believe in being honest, true, chaste, 
benevolent, virtuous, and in doing 
good to all men ; indeed, we may 
say that we follow the admonition 
of Paul, We believe all things, we 
hope all things, we have endured 
many things, and hope to be able to 
endure all things. If there is any- 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thing virtuous, lovely, or of good 
report, or praiseworthy, we seek 
after these things." 

If we could only bring- ourselves 
to that ! Self-analysis can prove to 
us whether we are progressing 
along these lines. God will be 
pleased with our effort to improve 
ourselves ; and when we have set 
ourselves right, we can go out and 
teach these principles to others. 

God grant that the way may be 
opened for us to promulgate the 
gospel of peace, the gospel of 
brotherly kindness and charity 
throughout the earth, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

I shall endeavor to divide the 
time that is left with President 
Kimball and I will try to astonish 
you by being brief. 

First I desire to read a verse 
from the prophecy of Daniel : "And 
in the days of these kings shall the 
God of heavea set up a kingdom 
which shall neyer be destroyed, and 
the kingdom shall not be left to 
other people^ but it shall break in 
pieces and consume all these king- 
doms and it shall stand forever" 
(Daniel 2:44). 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, many 
years ago (in the early days of the 
Church), and during his temporary 
residence in the state of Missouri, 
was arrested on a charge of trea- 
son, because he alluded to the ful- 
filment of this prophecy of Daniel 
in the coming forth of the Church 



of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints ; and, together with other 
men — his faithful co-laborers — he 
suffered several months in prison. 
The main accusation against the 
prophet was, as I have stated, trea- 
son, but of course it was a trumped- 
up or unwarranted charge. 

The passage in holy writ which 
I have quoted is a part of the in- 
terpretation given by Daniel the 
Prophet to King Nebuchadnezzar, 
when that mighty monarch had a 
vision of a great image which sym- 
bolized certain great kingdoms 
which should flourish in regular 
succession upon the earth, and in 
which interpretation Nebuchadnez- 
zar himself was referred to as the 
head of gold, or a world regent — 
a "ruler over them all." 

But the Lord became very angry 
with Nebuchadnezzar because of 
his pride and arrogance, and be- 
cause he would not acknowledge the 
God of heaven and earth, and as a 
punishment God took away the 
king's reason, after which that once 
mighty man spent seven years 
among the animals of the fields, eat- 
ing herbs and grass like some of 
the beasts. His grandson Belshaz- 
zar attempted to mock the God of 
Israel by using the 'holy vessels 
( that had been taken from the tem- 
ple in Jerusalem), in a drunken 
feast with his nobles and harlots. 
The Lord was so angry with him 
because of his wickedness that he 
allowed the Medes and Persians to 
break into his capital city that very 
night and kill him, thus destroy- 
ing the great kingdom of Baby- 
lon, and verifying the interpreta- 
tion given by Daniel to the inscrip- 
tion on the wall : "God hath num- 
bered thy kingdom and finished it; 
thou art weighed in the balance 
and art found wanting; thy king- 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



129 



dom is divided and given to the 
Medes and Persians" (Daniel 5: 
26-28). 

Another man who in course of 
time aspired to become the ruler 
over the whole world was Alex- 
ander the Great who, after subdu- 
ing all the nations of the earth 
known to him, wept because there 
was nothing more to conquer. It 
must be remefnbered in this con- 
nection that men did not at that 
time know the size of the earth; 
it being long before America was 
known to the people of Europe and 
Asia, and also long before the 
southern part of Africa, and many 
of the islands of the sea had been 
discovered; but Alexander set him- 
self up as the great master of all, 
the great ruler of the whole world, 
and took upon himself, like ihis 
predecessors, to deprive men of 
their free agency and to make them 
slaves. But the Lord soon humbled 
Alexander and his days in the role 
of an arrogant and proud ruler 
were only of short duration. 

Next we have the Roman em- 
pire which endeavored first in a 
political way and later as an ec- 
clesiastical power to rule the world 
with an iron hand, and crush the 
people who would not yield to the 
dominion of Rome ; but that power 
was also broken and the aspirations 
of the usurpers of authority were 
never fully gratified. 

The great Napoleon Bonaparte 
tried to conquer the world about a 
hundred years ago. From his indi- 
vidual standpoint some of his plans 
were perhaps intended for good. 
He aspired, it seems, to be a great 
liberator of men, but he also arro- 
gated to himself that which the 
Lord has reserved for Christ, the 
Redeemer of the world who is the 
only one who, according to the di- 



vine plan, is destined ultimately to 
rule the whole earth; but the rule 
of Christ will be one of righteous- 
ness under which the free agency 
of men will be respected. 

I refer to these matters in con- 
nection with an important theme 
which has been dwelt upon by many 
or the speakers at this general con- 
ference of the Church, and in ref- 
erence to our views as Latter-day 
Saints. We have in the world at the 
present time another man who is 
not mentioned in Daniel's interpre- 
tation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream. 
Nevertheless he is following in the 
wake of Nebuchadnezzar and his 
other predecessors, who aspired to 
power and unrighteous dominion. 
He also wants to arrogate to himi- 
self that which belongs solely to the 
King of kings and Lord of lords, 
and aspires to rule the world ac- 
cording to his own notions and be- 
hests ; but we know that the Ger- 
man kaiser will not succeed. It is 
only a matter of time till he will 
go the way of all his predecessors. 

But as Latter-day Saints we 
know something in regard to the 
kingdom of God which has been 
set up upon the earth in these the 
last days by the God of heaven, in 
fulfilment of Daniel's prophetic ut- 
terances. The Church and king- 
dom to which I refer and to which 
the Latter-day Saints belong has 
quite a history already, and I will 
just mention at this point to 
Brother Lesueur, president of the 
Maricopa stake, that the last thing 
I did at the Historian's office, be- 
fore this conference commenced, 
was to write the history of the Mar- 
icopa stake of Zion, including a 
history of the Papago ward — the 
Indian ward — which was organized 
in Arizona many years ago. We 
are endeavoring to write a true 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



history of the Church and kingdom 
of God as it has been established 
through the instrumentality of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. Personally 
I have not only had the privilege 
with many others of my brethren, 
to preach the gospel in many lands 
and climes, but \ have also had the 
opportunity of studying and writ- 
ing the history of the Latter-day 
Saints — the people who stand alone 
and separate in many respects from 
all others in their day and genera- 
tion — the people who are destined 
to exercise a great influence in the 
world, but not to rule with arro- 
gance and oppression — a people 
who will be accepted by Christ 
when he comes to reign as the 
King of kings and Lord of lords. 
We firmly believe that at some fu- 
ture day the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints will become 
known and accepted for what it 
really is, and that millions of peo- 
ple shall not only know the Prophet 
Joseph again, but shall also know 
many other faithful men who have 
labored for the . salvation and lib- 
erties of humanity. When that day 
comes, the people of the earth will 
become immensely interested in the 
history of the Church out of which 
shall grow the kingdom of God. 

For many years some of your 
brethren at the Historian's office 
have been busily engaged in im- 
portant historical labors, aside from 
other duties. We have written his- 
tories of every stake of Zion, and 
of every mission field throughout 
the entire world, and it may be 
gratifying to the hosts of Zion, in- 
cluding those who are present here 
today, when I say that we have 
almost completed this task which 
was commenced thirty-one years 
ago. We have proceeded so far 
with the histories of missions, 



stakes, wards, and conferences that 
we now need a more thorough co- 
operation with some of those who 
constitute the membership in the 
various stakes and missions. I 
have already suggested on a num- 
ber of occasions that a historian be 
appointed in every stake of Zion 
and in every ward throughout the 
Church to co-operate with the His- 
torian's office, in order to make our 
histories accurate and complete in 
every detail. 

We have already prepared a 
great deal of material which we 
expect in the near future to read 
to the people, and in order to com- 
plete our labors, we expect before 
long to make a trip throughout the 
stakes of Zion and read to the old set- 
tlers and others in the different 
wards and settlements of the Saints 
such parts of the history as per- 
tain to their particular ward or 
stake ; and when this is done and 
the local historians otherwise have 
had an opportunity to assist us, we 
hope to possess the most complete 
and accurate history that has ever 
been prepared and written about 
any people in the world — a true his- 
tory in the fullest sense. It may 
not be amiss to state here that his- 
torians sometimes are the servants 
of those who will pay them for 
their labors, but the histories which 
we have prepared and are prepar- 
ing of stakes, missions, and indi- 
viduals are written from an im- 
partial standpoint, as we have 
worked independent of any favors 
on the part of any individual, ex- 
cept that common Latter-day Saint 
hospitality and assistance which 
we have met with almost univer- 
sally everywhere in our travels. 

In the various stakes of Zion 
there are still alive many men and 
women who have figured as faith- 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



131 



ful and successful workers in the 
Church ; and there are many oth- 
ers now dead who from the begin- 
ning took a most active part in the 
establishment of God's work upon 
the earth. These faithful workers 
in the good cause should not be for- 
gotten, and we are endeavoring at 
the Historian's office to record cer- 
tain facts concerning them which 
will cause their memory to live for- 
ever. 

Those of us who are working 
faithfully in the Church today will, 
like our predecessors, grow old 
and pass to the great beyond, and 
our children and grand children 
will, as time rolls on, include us 
among the founders of the great 
kingdom which Daniel speaks 
about. I will say here that your 
historians have been pursuing a 
plan by which faithful men and 
women can be placed on record 
without being sold into the hands 
of strangers who come into our 
midst for the sole purpose of finan- 
cial gain. These strangers have 
charged from twenty-five to a thou- 
sand dollars or more to write a bi- 
ography of a man or a woman who 
has figured prominently among our 
people, omitting, of course, those 
who could not raise the amount re- 
quired. It is not necessary to sub- 
mit to this method of having bi- 
ographies written because the work 
done at the Historian's office is of 
such a nature that even the poor 
are given credit for what they have 
done. If a letter should be re- 
ceived by any of our leading men 
emanating from the Historian's of- 
fice concerning biographical mat- 
ters, let me assure you that it is not 
based on selfish motives, but only 
intended for the good of the people, 
and calls only for proper co-opera- 



tion on the part of those who are 
entitled to credit. Here is, for in- 
stance Apostle Charles C. Rich, 
whose grandson has addressed 
us to day, and many others, 
whose names and deeds should not 
be forgotten, but in order to pre- 
serve their memories it is neces- 
sary that histories of their lives 
should be written. Think of the 
members of Zion's Camp, the Utah 
pioneers of 1847, the members of 
the "Mormon" Battalion, the mar- 
tyrs of the Church, the missionaries 
who have died abroad, etc. The 
great majority of all these would 
be forgotten in a generation or two, 
were it not for that which shall be 
recorded about them in history. By 
co-operation we can perpetuate the 
memory of all faithful workers in 
the Church, rich and poor alike, and 
that is what we have aimed to ac- 
complish. 

May God bless us who are now 
workers in the Lord's vineyard, and 
enable us to be faithful and true, 
even as our fathers and mothers 
before us have been faithful and 
true ; and if we can, Nephi like, do 
greater works than our fathers have 
done, it is our privilege to do so, 
because we have better opportu- 
nities in many respects than they 
had. May God enable us to be 
what he wants us to be and remain 
true and faithful to the end, and 
may we to the very best of our 
ability do our part to promote the 
interest of this great kingdom 
which Daniel speaks of — a king- 
dom that shall endure forever ! and 
by and bye will come our turn to be 
rewarded for our faithfulness. 

That God may bless Zion and her 
interests everywhere is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of the Seventy.) 

There is only a few minutes left, 
but we will presume upon your time 
as we have two duets that we desire 
to have sung. There isn't any part 
of our services more inspiring than 
the singing and at no time have I 
heard anything better than the 
music and singing during these ser- 
vices. 

"Stay Thou with Me" was ren- 
dered as a duet by Myrtle W. Doelle 
and Joseph Kjar, preceded by the 
following remarks : 

PROFESSOR EVAN STEPHENS. 

I want to say a word in explana- 
tion of this duet. I was requested 
to put this piece on, through some 
of the brethren hearing it in one of 
our wards, last Sunday night. I 
want to say a word about it for fear 
you will misunderstand the object 
of it. You might take it to be a sec- 
ular, or what is sometimes termed a 
"love" duet. The idea is this : I 
have been asked thousands of times, 
probably, by different people who 
have good voices and musical abil- 
ity: "Brother Stephens, I have a 
gifted son, a gifted daughter, would 
you advise me to send them abroad 
to study?" "Would you advise me 
to take or send them away from 
home for study?" This piece has 
been written for an answer to that 
question. My answer is, "No," and 
this song, "Stay. Thou with Me," is 
partly the answer. We have de- 
veloped some splendid talent by 
sending it away, but as a rule, I 
think it is safe to say, if our young 
people have ties to cling to, in nine 
cases out of ten, it is better for 
them to "Stay thou with me : from 



my side may it not lure thee." The 
subject in this duet is in that way 
really a reply. Do not go from 
home ; and so "Brother Stephens 
has not put on some 'love' duets in 
conference." This one is a sermon 
in itself. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

(Of the First Council of Seventy.) 

This is the first time in twenty- 
five years of missionary service that 
I have been honored to preside at a 
public meeting connected with the 
Semi-annual Conference of the 
Church, and I would like to preside 
with a good deal of dignity, and 
have tried to do ,so. 

I am a little nervous when given 
an opportunity to speak, knowing 
that what I say will be taken down 
by a stenographer, and when my 
discourse is written in cold type, it 
/loesn't read well or sound good to 
me, as it has but little spirit, and no 
feeling in it. I am now speaking 
of my discourses. 

My most fervent desire is to 
speak of what I know and how I 
feel, but it's a great fight to be able 
to express your real feelings. I am 
looking ahead, and worrying about 
some things that are useless and a 
waste of energy. At times I am 
exercised about death and the here- 
after, but as Charles Frohman 
phrased it, under spiritual enthusi- 
asm, "Why fear death? it is the 
mo,st beautiful adventure of life." 
I would like to die, if I can, with- 
out fear, in fact, die like a Roman. 

My purpose is not to discourse on 
wonderful things, that I have 
achieved and experienced, but my 
wish and desire is to reach the 
hearts of men. I only wish I was 
better understood ; but unless men 
are of my temperament and see 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



133 



things as I see them, with a moving 
picture mind, they can not compre- 
hend things in the way I do. 

I may not .stand blameless before 
God at the last day, but I am not 
afraid to meet my God and be 
judged by the Lord as to my desires, 
efforts and works. I understand the 
gospel of Jesus Christ well enough 
to know that God is perfect and 
'deals out justice and mercy to his 
children ; Jesus Christ is the door 
to the ,sheep-fold, and with all my 
many imperfections and weak- 
nesses, if I am invited by the Mas- 
ter to come in at the door, all men 
who try to block my way will get 
run over and pushed aside. 

I .do not trust in man, but I honor 
and respect men who hold the 
Priesthood of God. I haven't given 
my life for this work, but have 
shown forth a willingness to place 
the little I have on the altar. I 
haven't been called, nor asked to do 
anything, that I have not responded. 
No appointment has been given me 
that I have not filled, in my way, 
and to the best of my ability. 

I can do anything I am set apart 
to do, if I have the .spirit of my 
appointment and am humble and 
prayerful. 

I know the sick are healed 
through the laying on of hands, as 
well as any man in all Israel, as I 
have witnessed the healing of the 
sick. I know we have the spirit of 
prophecy, for I have tried it out, 
and it works all right, if you get the 
spirit of prophecy. This work is 
true. This is the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, but 
when you so' testify it ought to be 
Hone bv the spirit of prophecy and 
revelation. 

As far as the Government of the 
United States is concerned, I feel 



somewhat like General Pershing did 
when he offered to the Allied na- 
tions the army of the United States. 
We parents give to our country our 
sons just as gladly and freely to 
enter Into this great struggle for 
justice and liberty for humanity. 

If you can grasp my meaning you 
will know exactly how I feel to- 
wards the Church and the Priest- 
hood. The Lord knows I love the 
Church, her people, and my Coun- 
try, and. I have no fear that the 
Lord cannot overrule and overturn 
nations and people, until they shall 
repent and serve him. The Lord 
has taken care of me, and I have 
learned to trust him, as he is a good 
Master, and he is full of mercy, 
justice, kindness and love. 

I feel to say, "God save the peo- 
ple, not kings, but the people." If I 
had written that poetry, I would 
have .said, "God save the people" — 

and to with the kings, but as 

I didn't write it, will refrain from 
saying it. 

Brethren and sisters, this work is 
true, for I have worked and labored 
in it until I know of its truth: I 
am now going to ask you a few 
questions : "Do you know of any- 
thing in all this beautiful world that 
is more important than human 
life?" You don't, do you? I will 
ask the same question in another 
way : "Do you know of anything 
in all this great universe that is 
dearer to the Father than a human 
soul?" You don't, do you? Of 
course, you don't, as the Lord said 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
"And if it so be that you should 
labor all your days in crying re- 
pentance unto this people, and bring 
save it be one soul unto me, how 
great will be your joy with him in 
the kingdom of my Father." 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



To be saved in the kingdom of 
God is the greatest of all the gifts 
of God ; for there is no gift greater 
than the gift of salvation. Then 
"soul hunting" is of far greater im- 
portance than spending one's life in 
money seeking, and the accumula- 
tion of wealth. I can see that the 
things of God must be made more 
interesting than the things of the 
world ; that the things of God 
must be better advertised than the 
material things of the world. 

I almost forgot the one thing I 
desired to say, and that is : God 
bless the choir, the .singers and mu- 
sicians. I know as well as I know 
anything that the Lord will bless 
Brother Evan Stephens ; and as a 
servant of the Lord, I promise him 
he shall have the Holy Spirit to 
comfort and console him, and he 
shall not be lonely or desolate 
among this people. God bless all 
these sweet singers he is training. 
Little do you people know what it 
costs in time, effort, and study, to 
acquire the art to sing; if we as a 
people put forth a tithe of the 
effort they do to sing, in studying 
the word of God, we would be the 
most intelligent people in all the 
world. The Lord bless you. Amen. 

After .singing, by the combined 
choirs, "Grant us peace," President 
Rey L. Pratt pronounced the bene- 
diction. 



SECOND MEETING 
OUT-DOORS. 

A second outdoor meeting was 
held in front of the Bureau of In- 
formation Building, at 2 p. m., 
Elder Charles H. Hart, of the First 
Council of Seventy, presiding. 



The music and singing were fur- 
nished by the Ensign Male Chorus. 

The chorus and congregation 
sang: "Let Zion in her beauty 
rise. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. 
E. Evans. 

The chorus and congregation 
sang: "Lo, the Gentile chain is 
broken." 

ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON. 

(President of South Sanpete Stake of 
Zion.) 

My dear brethren, sisters, and 
friends, I do not know whether I 
shall be able to make you hear what 
I may have to say to this vast con- 
gregation gathered upon these 
grounds. I am very grateful to my 
heavenly Father for the blessings 
that we enjoy through his Holy 
Spirit, poured out in great abund- 
ance upon the Saints who have been 
gathered in this Conference. The 
blessings of our heavenly Father 
have come to the people in these 
valleys of the mountains. His gra- 
cious care has been over them. 
Prosperity has attended the efforts 
put forth by the people who have 
gathered from every land and clime, 
and God has been merciful unto 
them. He has granted unto them 
health and strength, the comforts 
of life. 

My reflections have gone out to 
the time when I first saw this spot, 
in 1859. The first worship that I 
attended was in a little building that 
was located here in the southwest 
corner of this block, as I remember 
it. There were none of these ele- 
gant buildings erected at that time 
— the holy temple here, the taber- 
nacle, and these other magnificent 
buildings of worship erected for the 



ELDER LEWIS ANDERSON.

good and blessing of the Saints and 
the preaching of the gospel. All 
these have come since that day. I 
remember vividly the instructions 
given by the late President Brigham 
Young upon several occasions, not 
only in the services held in the 
tabernacle, but I also remember 
vividly the instructions given by 
him on the tours that he made of 
the various settlements of the Saints 
in- the southern part of the country, 
where I was reared. 

I remember the counsel and in- 
structions of a practical nature 
given unto the gathered people. I 
remember distinctly the counsel in 
relation to being self-sustaining, 
frugal, and building up homes and 
cities in this land of Zion. Those 
practical words of instruction have 
been followed up, as we heard, too, 
in the opening session of the Con- 
ference from our beloved President 
Joseph F. Smith. 

I believe in a practical religion. 
I believe in that which shall build 
up, advance, comfort and bless man 
upon the earth. I believe in that 
which shall bring about the preach- 
ing: of the gospel of the Son of God, 
both at home and abroad, and aid 
this great work that God has estab- 
lished in these the latter days. I am 
thankful for the work that has been 
accomplished in the building of 
temples in our midst, in which the 
gospel of salvation can reach the 
living, and the dead as well, for the 
gospel is not all to the living, it is 
also to the dead. I believe in the 
literal scriptural sayings of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and 
his apostles. I believe they are lit- 
erally true, and that our Master, 
when he went into the spirit world, 
preached the gospel to those who 
had gone before, who were some- 



time disobedient in the days of 
Noah when the ark was preparing. 
I believe in the mission of the elders 
of Israel who have gone before. I 
believe that the gospel is to be 
preached on the other side as well 
as on this side. I also believe that 
it is the duty of Latter-day Saint 
elders to preach the gospel in every 
land, clime, to every people — for I 
believe that the Lord has said that 
when this mission shall be finished 
that the end will come. The testi- 
mony of the message of life and 
salvation must go to all people of 
the earth, before the consummation 
of that which has been spoken by 
the prophets of the Lord. 

The gospel means a great deal to 
us, not only in the word but in the 
living of it. I believe it is right to 
have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 
and in his mission and being. I 
testify to you of this knowledge, 
and I am grateful for the testimony 
T have that God lives, and that 
Jesus Christ is his Son. I am thank- 
ful, my brethren and s : sters, for the 
principles of the gospel wherein re- 
pentance is brought to those who 
need repentance ; and I am grateful 
for the blessingfs of baptism for the 
remission of sins, the laying on of 
hands for the reception of the Holv 
Ghost. These are principles of sal- 
vation, and no one, according to the 
holy scriptures, can enter into the 
kingdom of God without these or- 
dinances being administered unto 
them. This is the word of the 
Lord, and these principles are plain 
scripture. Thev are set forth for 
our guidance. But these are not all 
that Latter-day Saints need to ob- 
serve. They are the ordinances 
that are reauired. Then there is 
the living- of the gospel of the Son 
of God, there is the putting into

practice the teachings which he 
gave unto men while he was upon 
the earth. These sometimes are 
difficult for us to observe as we 
ought to. If we did so, we would 
be the best people upon the earth. 
Notwithstanding-, I say, that we 
tvould be the best, we are the best 
people upon the earth, inasmuch as 
we observe the commandments of 
the Lord. Ours is a practical re- 
ligion, it is an every-day religion — 
with us it is not simply going to the 
house of worship upon the Sabbath 
day. That is required of Latter- 
day Saints, and a great many of 
them forget this great blessing that 
they enjoy of observing the Sabbath 
day and assembling in the worship 
of our heavenly Father. I believe 
that wherein we do not observe the 
day set apart for the worship of 
him, we become spiritually sick, and 
become dead branches, as it were ; 
and the Spirit of the Lord will 
withdraw from us, inasmuch as we 
do not observe this commandment 
of the Lord. 

I have had a great deal of pleas- 
ure, my brethren and sisters, in the 
work of the salvation for the dead. 
I have had the honor of associating 
with my brethren wfto have pre- 
sided over the Manti temple from 
the beginning, in 1888 — President 
Daniel H. Wells and President An- 
thon H. Lund, President John D. 
McAllister, President John B. 
Maiben, and others who have been 
there. I had great pleasure in asso- 
ciating with and partaking of the 
spirit with which they were imbued. 
I remember very vividly the in- 
structions of our beloved President 
Daniel H. Wells, who was the first 
president of that temple. I remem- 
ber what he said relating to the 
preaching of the Prophet Joseph 



Smith in the city of Nauvoo, and of 
his own conversion into the Church 
of Christ. It will be remembered 
that at that time he was not a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, but a staunch 
friend of the people of God who 
had assembled there. And he said 
upon one occasion that there was 
nothing in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ that so appealed to him as 
the principle of the redemption of 
the dead, brought forth by the reve- 
lations of God through the Prophet 
Joseph. He had, he said, gone to 
many denominations. His father 
had not been a member of any 
church. His anxious question was 
as to his father. Where would he 
be? Of course, he was answered 
that there was no redemption for 
him ; he was entirely lost — 'his 
father and mother were lost, and 
they would not associate together! 
That was the word that he received. 
But the Prophet said that we should 
be joined together with tho.se of our 
kindred who had gone before ; that 
there was salvation for those who 
had gone behind the veil, for the 
dead ; and the gospel was being 
preached to them the same as to the 
living. We have an abundance of 
scripture relating to that matter, 
which gave him comfort and joy, 
and which upheld him, and he said, 
"Where my father is and my 
mother, there is where I desire to 
be, and with my kindred." 

That is the doctrine of Christ, 
who gave it. His apostles who fol- 
lowed him, also preached it. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
in the blessings of our Father unto 
us as his people; and in the gifts 
and blessings that we enjoy in this 
land. I am thankful for the free- 
dom that exists here, the blessings

that have been poured out upon this 
land of Zion, land of liberty; and I 
trust that we will be found worthy, 
and in the ranks of those who shall 
defend the principles of right and 
liberty all the days of our lives. It 
has been said in times past that as 
a people we have not been loyal ; 
we have been falsely charged with 
not being a loyal people to our 
Government. I do not know of 
anything that speaks louder than 
the works that have been and are 
being done by the Latter-day Saints 
today in offering our sons and our 
daughters to go to uphold and sus- 
tain the principles of right and lib- 
erty ; and in contributing of sub- 
stance freely for the cause that we 
believe to be right, and for the up- 
holding and sustaining of the great 
Constitution of our land. By the 
blessings of God, no king shall rule 
upon this land ! God has decreed it, 
and I know that his words will not 
fail. God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in this opportunity to bear 
testimony to you who have come 
here to receive the word of the 
Lord. The opportunity and priv- 
ilege which is afforded us to as- 
semble as members of the Church, 
to receive instructions at these con- 
ferences, will at the end of the or- 
dinary life prove a liberal educa- 
tion in the vital things of life. And 
I do most sincerely hope that we 
shall not only come here to listen, 
but to believe that which we hear, 
and that we shall adopt it into 



practice in our lives. I have ob- 
served that it is easy to listen, and 
that it is difficult to practice that 
which we know we ought to do. I 
have occasion to know that many 
times we have to be reminded and 
told over and over again the things 
we ought to do and we know we 
ought to do them, but we do not 
have the courage to do them. I 
remember a physician advising a 
certain man that if he did not quit 
the use of liquor, he was going to 
suffer a premature death. The man 
who was then advised ceased the 
use of liquor; but the physician 
who had administered the admoni- 
tion died a drunkard himself, not- 
withstanding he knew he was doing 
wrong. What we lack is the moral 
courage to carry into execution our 
convictions. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
that many of us Latter-day Saints 
have treated very lightly the in- 
structions and the counsel that have 
been given to us by the leaders of 
this Church, we have not profited 
by their advice, and we will reap 
only that which we have sown. We 
shall discover that we will not es- 
cape the chastening hand of God, 
after having been taught and ad- 
monished, and we shall find God 
will not be mocked. 

I believe that this is the day of 
judgment. I believe that we are 
approaching a time when men and 
women cannot mock God and live 
in open defiance of his law without 
soon coming to answer for the re- 
sponsibility that rests upon us to 
act as we please. I believe, breth- 
ren and sisters, that we live in the 
most important age the world has 
ever seen, a time foreseen by the 
prophets of old whose minds were 
lit up by inspiration when they 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spoke and talked of our day. There 
is not a man or boy here with whom 
Abraham would not have ex- 
changed places. There is not 
a man that any of the worthy 
prophets of God would not rather 
have changed places with and lived 
in this day of wonderful oppor- 
tunity, this day of the consummation 
of God's great purposes in the 
earth. They would rather have 
been where you are than where they 
were. 

I think sometimes we live too 
close to wonderful things to r eaHy 
realize them. I often have the op- 
portunity of standing on Portland 
Heights, west of the city of Port- 
land, and looking sixty miles east. 
On a beautiful, clear day, I can see 
rising majestic above the Cascade 
range of mountains, Mt. Hood, 
eternally crowned with snow, and 
its very base is the summit of the 
mountains — rising 11,0:00 feet to a 
distance approaching the storms' 
home ; and I always go away feel- 
ing more inspired. My backbone 
is a little stiffer, and I feel a little 
more that spirit of worship and 
adoration of God ; for not only do 
the heavens declare the glory of 
God, but his works around and 
about us, if we will only open our 
eves, preach sermons to us. And 'I 
always wanted to go up to the 
mountain. I had the opportunity 
a few years ago, and when I 
reached the base of the mountain, 
the 6,000 foot elevation, I thought 
I would be filled by the wonder of 
that scene — but instead, I was up 
against the face of a great cliff that 
rose thousands of feet above me, 
and I could only see about a hun- 
dredth part of the mountain, and I 
was disappointed; but as I passed 
through that experience I said. 



"How that is like life : we are often 
too close to the big and the great 
and the grand things to really real- 
ize and understand them. We have 
to get a little further away to get 
a proper view and understanding. I 
understood then why it was that he 
who stands out as the most illus- 
trious character of all the ages, 
who is the Summit of all peaks, 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was 
not understood by his own genera- 
tion. They were too close to him 
to see him. You have to get nun- 
dreads of years away before his 
greatness, his majesty, and his 
power can be seen and compre- 
hended by the multitude. And I 
understood, too, how it is that the 
rrophets have not been without 
honor, except in their own country 
and in their own time. It has taken 
one or two generations to elapse 
before men began to see the worth 
and the merit of those who have 
been the world's greatest benefac- 
tors. And so it has been with 
" Mormonism," and with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. He was 
too close to the men and the women 
of his own time. They felt with 
him as they did with Jesus. Wasn't 
Jesus the carpenter's son? Didn't 
they know his father and his broth- 
ers? Just so men thought that they 
knew all about Joseph Smith, and 
that he did not have a message of 
any particular consequence to them ! 
And so they chose to turn their 
faces away from him. But as we 
recede from his day, and contem- 
plate the man and his message, we 
discover that he begins to rise to 
his own place and position, for he 
will stand as one of the pinnacles 
in the midst of the children of 
men ; and that which he did, men 
shall yet come to acknowledge was 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



139 



given of God, for the salvation not 
only of a few Latter-day Saints, 
but of the whole world. When the 
Lord has a message to give, he does 
not ask us, "Whom would you like 
me to speak through?" It is his 
business and right, to take a shep- 
herd, a tax collector, or if he 
chooses a farmer's boy, like Joseph 
Smith. That is his business. 

And the big thing is not after all 
the man through whom the mes- 
sage comes, but the message itself. 
Joseph's was a message of repent- 
ance to this generation. The Lord 
Almighty is deeply concerned over 
the men and the women of our own 
time. He has been pleading with 
us as Latter-day Saints to do the 
work he wants us to do ; but we 
have sometimes been very stubborn 
and indifferent to the message, and 
we have had to be forced, by cir- 
cumstances that surrounded us, to 
do the things the Lord wanted us 
to do, because we were unwilling 
otherwise. But he has in his mercy 
N hedged up the way and provided 
the means by which we would move 
where he wants us to, and do the 
things he wants us to do. 

And as he has been dealing with 
us, so is he dealing with the na- 
tions of the earth. And so I have 
this testimony — that God loves the 
whole world, and will save all men 
if they would repent — and yet not 
one single soul will escape the con- 
sequence of wrong doing, except he 
repent. I say that this is a day 
of judgment ; and I want to testify 
to you that the judgments of Al- 
mighty God are only beginning, 
and the war will go on, the judg- 
ments of God will go on until his 
purposes shall be accomplished in 
the earth, which is the humiliation, 



and repentance of the children of 
men. 

I want to testify that what Elder 
Whitney said this morning with 
reference to God compelling men to 
obedience, is true ; this has been 
witnessed many times in this gen- 
eration. 

I recall a circumstance that hap- 
pened some six weeks ago in Brit- 
ish Columbia, one of the confer- 
ences of our mission. A certain 
man had been approached to obtain 
permission to have his daughter 
baptized. The wife and some of 
the children belonged to the 
Church. He first gave it and then 
rejected the elders and withdrew 
his permission. They labored with 
him two or three nights in succes- 
sion trying to persuade him not 
only to give permission for the 
daughter to be baptized, but to be 
baptized himself ; and at last he be- 
came bitter, abused them, refused 
to have anything more to do with 
them, and said he was sorry he 
ever met the "Mormon" elders. 
When they left him they told him 
that they had borne witness and tes- 
timony to him of the truth, that he 
knew enough to condemn him, that 
they would be witnesses against 
him in the day of judgment, and 
that the Lord would deal with him. 
He simply laughed and said, "I am 
not afraid of the consequences, 
don't you worry at all about the 
judgment." The next night about 
9 o'clock he was stricken with a 
malady that the physicians who 
were called could not diagnose, only 
that he was dying, that he was 
filled with pain from head to foot 
and he writhed in agony, and re- 
fused to respond to the treatment 
that was administered. He suffered 
for hours, until his proud, haughty 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spirit was broken. And then he 
turned to his wife and said, "You 
g"o find those 'Mormon' elders." It 
was one o'clock in the morning 
when the brethren were brought to 
his bedside; he began to cry when 
they came in, and said, "I have 
been in hell this night. I have been 
taken at my own word, and God 
has punished me." And he humbly 
begged their forgiveness and said, 
"I will not only give consent for my 
daughter to be baptized, but I will 
be baptized myself." They laid 
their hands upon him and blessed 
him, and his malady left him. He 
arose the next day, and with his 
daughter was baptized. I saw him 
three days later, and heard his tes- 
timony, and he said : "As Paul 
was stricken on the road to Damas- 
cus, so have I been stricken, and I 
am now willing to do what the 
Lord wants me to do." 

I want to say that while the Lord 
may be swift in some instances and 
slow in others, just as sure as we 
live, he will not be mocked ; and we 
shall come to judgment. We may 
hide our sins, we may try to cover 
them up, but every one of us shall 
come face to face with the judg- 
ment, sooner or later. O, may the 
Lord be merciful to us and chastise 
us before we have to go too far. 

I spoke yesterday concerning the 
war and its effect as I witnessed it 
in some of our Canadian territory, 
where we have seen the spirit of re- 
pentance coming over the people, 
and men began to enquire after the 
gospel. When our elders came to 
the homes of the people where the 
son or the father had been taken — 
for there was a terrible loss of life 
in the first companies of Canadian 
soldiers who went to Europe, and 
there was scarcely a block where 



there was not somebody weeping 
for the loss of their dead — the thing 
they wanted to talk about was the 
•dead loved one. The sweet comfort 
of salvation for the dead, as re- 
vealed through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, has brought consolation to 
many thousands of people ; and 
many began to pray to God who 
never prayed before. When a man 
begins to pray, he begins to repent 
and turn from the wicked things 
which he has been in the habit of 
f'oing. A spirit like this took pos- 
session of the people until we had 
an increase in baptisms of ten 
times as many as in any preceding 
year. I am expecting to see that 
same thing start all over this and 
other lands. 

We received the word of God 
not only for the Latter-day Saints, 
but for the whole world, to avoid 
the use of intoxicating drinks, to 
observe a more strict diet in the 
use of meat, not to use tea and 
coffee ; and only the Latter-day 
Saints have believed this doctrine. 
The result of obeying it has been 
that when our boys go to the can- 
tonments, their physical examina- 
tion stands higher than any other 
class of men. When some of our 
boys from one of our "Mormon" 
settlements in Idaho recently passed 
their examinations, the physician 
said, "Where did you boys come 
from?" they told him. "Well," 
said he, "I have never examined as 
clean a bunch of men in my life." 
There were not one among them 
that was not physically sound and 
perfectly clean. 

A major in the army, a "Mor- 
mon" boy, said to me: "I never 
appreciated the teachings of my 
father and mother until I came out 
here. I did not pay much atten- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



141 



tion to the Church, but when I came 
here and found the truths I had 
been taught were the very things 
now demanded of me by the officers 
of the army, I have a greater re- 
spect for my Church and parentage 
than I have ever experienced be- 
fore. 

One of the greatest commercial 
advertisers, and organizers of com- 
mercial bodies, spoke in our chapel 
at Portland a few years ago, he had 
experience not only among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, but all over the 
world. He turned to a company of 
"Mormon" missionaries, and said, 
"If you want to win the laurels and 
the plaudits of the world in the fu- 
ture, you just stay by the standards 
of your fathers and mothers, and 
you will come out on top with your 
colors flying. Do not abandon the 
things that they have held dear." 
He died last year, but this was his 
testimony, and this is my testimony 
to you, brethren and sisters. It is 
being demonstrated in the canton- 
ments where our "Mormon" boys 
are now reporting for service. But 
the beginning of the reformation, 
and the change that the Lord wants 
to spread all over trie world, until 
the whole world shall keep the 
Word of Wisdom, too, is coming. 
We have been preaching prohibi- 
tion, the abstinence from the use of 
liquors — and I want to tell you that 
it would have taken fifty years to 
have accomplished the change 
among the nations of the earth 
that has come during this war. The 
Lord has forced the circumstances 
of nations so that they are abandon- 
ing the use of liquor. 

We will come to the day when 
we will abandon the use of tobacco. 
Instead of sending train loads to 
our boys to undermine their health, 



we will be loading those trains with 
food for them ; and instead of 
using the acres that are now plant- 
ed to the raising of tobacco, we 
will raise wheat and other .sub- 
stances that shall be needed. We 
will come to the day when we will 
have to conserve this land for rais- 
ing of more beneficial things ; so 
the leaven is working and God's 
purposes are being accomplished in 
the nations of the earth through the 
chastisement that is coming. 

Now, brethren and .sisters, I do 
not think there is an experience 
through which we have passed but 
that has its lesson. What is the 
lesson to us ? The lesson to the 
Latter-day Saints is this, that we 
who have been called and chosen 
to be the ensign, the pattern, the 
example to the world, .shall set our 
houses in order, that we shall turn 
our faces toward the Lord. And 
we know many of us have neglect- 
ed him. We know we have failed 
to keep the commandments of the 
Lord. We must repent, for if we 
do not repent, we shall be chas- 
tised too, for the Lord does not 
look upon sin and wickedness in a 
Latter-day Saint with any degree 
of allowance, any more than in any- 
body else ; but because of our 
knowledge, greater responsibility 
rests upon our shoulders. 

Brethren and sisters, be not 
alarmed or disturbed if our boys 
go into battle. Be not concerned 
if some of them lay down, their lives 
— for if so, it shall be that we too 
need to be touched, and have our 
hearts turned back to the things of 
God that some of us have almost 
forgotten. In our mad zeal in the 
accumulation of the things of this 
world, we have almost lost .sight of 
the purposes that God had in bring-

ing our fathers to these valleys of 
the mountains, giving them more 
precious things than gold and sil- 
ver. The blessed heritage of the 
gospel has been entrusted into the 
hands of the Latter-day Saints. The 
world has riches beyond anything 
we have, but we have the one 
precious thing that they do not 
have, and it is worth more than all 
other things in the world — the sav- 
ing principles, the priesthood, the 
virtue and the power of the gospel 
of the Son of God. And that is 
the thing the world will desire more 
than they want anything else,, and 
they will come to it. Shall we be 
prepared to give it to them? We 
will be, if we are wise ; and this is 
the day when I say we ought to 
set our houses in order, a day when 
we ought to repent. And if we 
need chastisement, it will come to 
us, and sorrow will come to us, 
only for the purpose of turning our 
hearts to the Lord in humility and 
faith to obtain and maintain the 
blessings God has promised to the 
faithful. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
a testimony as I have labored 
among the soldier boys who have 
been in these camps, that their faith 
is growing. I have listened to their 
testimonies, I have had the pleasure 
of ordaining to the Melchizedek 
Priesthood a score or more of them, 
some were not even deacons, when 
they went into the war, but they 
hav been reading, associating with 
their companions, returned mission- 
aries, and corresponding with their 
bishops, and thev now seek the 
priesthood ; and I never have been 
more inspired in my life than in 
laying my hands upon their heads' 
and blessing them and conferring 
the priesthood upon them, and I 



have never seen men more eager 
than some of them are. Do not fear 
for them, for my testimony is they 
are going to be on their mettle and 
keep the commandments of God, 
they are preparing themselves if 
necessary for the great sacrifice. 

When General Green, the com- 
mander of the Ninety-first Division 
at American Lake, returned recent- 
ly from France, he wanted every 
man in that cantonment to obtain 
a Bible, and said, "I want them to 
read over and over the story of the 
God-man who died for men, that 
you too may learn how to die for 
men." His statement to me was 
that he wanted our boys to have 
all the benefits of their church, all 
of its instruction and inspiration 
possible; this spirit is dominant 
among those men, and I say to you 
that I have a testimony that the ma- 
jority of our boys will come back 
again. 

The Lord Almighty made a 
promise that in the last .days he 
would mark his servants, even as 
the lintels of the doors were mark- 
ed in ancient Israel, and the de- 
stroying- angel who passed by 
spared those houses, so shall his 
servants be marked in their fore- 
heads and spared destruction in the 
last days. I may not see the mark 
but the destroying angels shall, and 
in the midst of battle his servants 
shall receive protection. 

We have had some ten of the 
brethren, members of the Church, 
in this battle since the very begin- 
ning, three years ago. They have 
been in all manner of .difficulties. A 
shell exploded near one of them 
and threw him forty feet in the air, 
and he fell on a pile of bricks. 
Three vertebrae were dislocated, 
but he recovered. They have been

in the midst of fire, but not one has 
lost his life, although they have 
been wounded. One of the breth- 
ren told me that he was in charge 
of a squad of men carrying the 
stretchers that picked the men up 
right where they dropped, in the 
battle field ; and he was in the midst 
of bursting shells for hours, and he 
said, "I never went a step of the 
way that there was not a prayer in 
my heart to save those poor wound- 
ed men and .save my own men and 
escape, and many times the inspira- 
tion of the Lord came to .me, 'Take 
this road out,' 'Stop there,' 'Turn 
there,' and immediately I have seen 
where I stood; a shell drop that 
tore everything to fragments, and 
we would have gone into eternity." 

I do not think the Lord will take 
hold of the shell and turn it away 
from your boy, but I think the 
Lord will put it into the heart of 
your boy to be in a place of se- 
curity, and those who command 
him will place him where he will 
do his 'duty and where he will be 
safe ; and the angels of the Lord 
shall be there, and it is my testi- 
mony that a majority of them shall 
come back home. 

I listened to the testimony of 
Harry Lauder, the great Scotch 
comedian. I heard him make a 
statement recently in Portland, and 
I give it to you as an evidence of 
that changing sentiment that is 
coming over the children of men. 
To young men usually death seems 
a long way off, but not so to the 
soldier boy. When we get old, we 
know we mav be sick and near the 
time of death, but these tens of 
thousands of young men, feel that 
it may be only a month or two and 
they will be slumbering in France, 
They want to know what shall hap- 



pen when their young life shall be 
cut short ; so many are now inter- 
ested, and we have baptized three 
of these young men, as a result of 
our labors in the cantonment at 
American Lake. 

I now see some of the comforts 
and blessings of fathers and moth- 
ers having more than one son, for 
if I have ever seen a thing that is 
heart-breaking, it is to go into a 
home where there is only one child, 
one boy, and he is gone, and they 
are all alone. There is comfort 'left 
for those who have more than one 
son, if accidents do come ; but there 
are some families whose names will 
be wiped out, they have had only 
one child. Harry Lauder had but 
one child, never thought he would 
perish, but he did, and when the 
blow fell upon him, he was dazed, 
and said for days he was beside 
himself in grief. "At times during 
those first days," he said, "I almost 
questioned the justice and wisdom 
of a God who would allow such a 
thing to happen." And then he 
said : 

All this time while I had been rag- 
ing against the cruel fates which had 
taken my son, there had been com- 
fort and peace in store for me, and I 
had not known it. And that comfort 
and peace lay in my belief in God and 
a future life beyond this sphere. 

Now, while the pain and grief had 
been blinding my eyes, God had been 
waiting- patiently for the first sharp 
agony to pass away, and when it did 
he gently lifted the veil from my eyes 
and showed me the promised land be- 
yond. T mean that suddenly I realized 
that I had not seen the last of John, 
and that we were sure to meet in 
another world. 

Oh, that I could convey unto you 
the healing balm that that thought 
was to my soul! I would that I 
could picture to you the joy of the 
thought that T was to see my John 
again at some future date, just as if 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



he had simply gone on a long journey, 
and was waiting for his mother and 
me to come to him. And I brought 
his image before me, and imagined 
him holding out his arms to his 
mother and myself to fold us within 
his loving embrace, and in the joy 
created by that picture I was able to 
assuage some of my pain and dis- 
tress, and return to an almost normal 
state of mind. 

And because of the great comfort 
that my belief and faith in the future 
life have brought me, I have become 
humbly grateful a,nd thankful that I 
never mocked the name of God or 
cast, him from me at any period of 
my life. Because I know, I am con- 
vinced, that he has helped me to bear 
this great blow by making my con- 
viction that this life is' not the end 
stronger than ever. 

This spirit is sweeping- over the 
world. And now the doctrine we 
believe that we shall live again, and 
be the same individual after death 
as in this life, though at one time 
believed only by few others than 
the Latterday Saints, has be- 
come the source of comfort and 
happiness among the children 
of men, and now they know 
they would not be satisfied if 
they could not meet the very John 
they laid away. They want to see 
him in the exact form and features, 
the very same individual. And now 
the blessed hope of salvation for 
the dead will come naturally into 
their lives. O, how wonderful are 
the provisions of our Father to 
meet all the emergencies of life — 
its joys, its sorrows, its distresses. 
Here is a gospel that meets all 
emergencies. 

But unless we keep the command- 
ments of God, we shall not reap the 
results of joy, and happiness, and 
security, and safety in the midst of 
troubles that are to come. My 
brethren and sisters, this is my tes- 
timony, that God lives, that this is 



the hour of judgment, the day of 
repentance, and that men will be 
forced to yield even through much 
sorrow and affliction if not other- 
wise, for it is the time when they 
must yield to the will and the pur- 
poses of Almighty God. 

May he bless us and help us as 
members of his Church to stand in 
our place and discharge our duty, 
and come out victorious whether we 
live or whether we die, that we 
shall be prepared to come into his 
presence and into that realm where 
we shall meet the blessed, and re- 
deemed, and saved in his celestial 
kingdom, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ORVIL S. THOMPSON. 

(President of Millard Stake of Zion.) 

My brethren and sisters: I am 
overwhelmed with the sense of the 
responsibility of this moment. I 
think I have never before been so 
thoroughly impressed with the re- 
sponsibility that attaches to an 
elder of the Church in occupying 
this position, as I have been during 
the sessions of this conference. The 
thought has come to me that here 
are men and women who have 
traveled great distances, from Can- 
ada, Arizona, Mexico, Idaho, our 
surrounding states, and from the 
furthermost points in our own 
state.who have come up here to be 
instructed. And how brief and how 
precious is the time in which to 
recieve the many instructions 
given! So, I pray, my brethren and 
sisters, and ask your faith and sup- 
port, that the time I have been al- 
lotted shall not be wasted, but that 
the Lord shall inspire that which I 
may be led to say. 

I wish to express my approval, 



ELDER ORVILLE L. THOMPSON 



145 



my hearty approval, of the spirit 
and business action taken in this 
conference from the beginning un- 
til this moment. I want to ex- 
press my approval of the selection 
; of the man who has been called to 
fill the vacancy in the quorum of 
the Twelve Apo.stles, caused by the 
death of Elder Hyrum M. Smith. I 
have known Richard Lyman ! for 
many years. I bear record of his 
virtues, of the uprightness of his 
life, and of his ability. I see in him 
a worthy son of an illustrious sire, 
worthy to carry on the splendid 
work left by his father. Since the 
death of Elder Smith, questions 
have come to me frequently, "Who 
do you suppo.se will be the new 
apostle?" It is a natural curiosity 
that comes into our minds on these 
occasions. But in answer to that, 
universally I have said, "It is not 
my business to choose, not my 
business to select, not my business 
to nominate — it is only my business 
to be in a position of faith and con- 
fidence in regard to the leaders of 
my Church, that shall lead me to 
sustain and support any one who 
shall be selected under the inspir- 
ation of the Lord, through his 
servants whose duty and privilege 
it is to nominate to these important 
positions. 

That faith and confidence and 
devotion which I desire to show to 
the authorities of the Church I ex- 
tend also in a very large measure to 
the authorities of our Nation in this 
hour of our national crisis, that I 
shall not destroy their influence by 
destructive criticism, but rather 
that I may help them if possible,, by 
my helpful work and sympathy. 

I rejoice in the testimonies of the 
conference, in the splendid instruc- 
tions, at the opening session, by 



President Joseph F. Smith ; and I 
have thought that if the Latter-day 
Saints had obeyed the instructions 
that were given in the early days 
of the Church, in the conservation 
of their resources and in the patron- 
izing of home institutions inaug- 
urated for the manufacture of the 
things necessary for the support 
and comfort of the people, that 
we would indeed be in a splendid 
condition at this day and time, and 
the necessity of teaching conserva- 
tion and supporting home industry 
would hardly be necessary among 
this people. 

I thought of the splendid work 
in the past of the Relief Society, 
of the thousands and thousands of 
bushels of grain stored in the 
granaries of our people by the 
officers and members of that or- 
ganization — of the instructions 
given by President Brigham Young 
and with what enthusiasm his coun- 
sel was taken up in the early days of 
the Church by the sisters. But we 
went along in a kind of a hap- 
hazard easy-going way, the neces- 
sity for that grain in the future 
seemed to grow more distant, we 
lost interest, the wheat was sold, 
the money invested in other things. 
The thought came to us that with 
the increased means of transpor- 
tation, with our immense resources 
of land and water, there never 
could come a time again when men 
and women would suffer for the 
necessities of life, for the staff of 
life, the bread necessary for the 
support of the body. 

We took up with the idea of the 
world, as announced just previous 
to the outbreak of the great war by 
a great educator, even within the 
walls of our Tabernacle, that a 
great international war for the 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



future was an impossibility, be- 
cause men had become too intel- 
ligent, the financial magnates of the 
earth would not finance another 
great struggle, and we might never 
expect to be engaged in another 
great conflict. But the Lord had de- 
clared that the people would be 
chastened, and one of the means 
of chastening was through the ef- 
fects of war. And it has come — and 
the benefits of those early teachings 
are now more apparent to us than 
they have ever been in the history 
of this people. 

I rejoice in the testimony of 
Elder Melvin J. Ballard in regard 
to the condition of our soldier boys 
located in the cantonments of our 
country. The United States Gov- 
ernment issues daily an official 
bulletin, which contains a descrip- 
tions of the orders and activities 
of those located at the seat of the 
Government. One of the items 
which I usually read with interest 
each week, in this official bulletin, 
is the health conditions of our sol- 
dier boys in the cantonments in the 
United States ; and the particular 
feature that I have paid attention 
and interest to is that which refers 
to the moral condition of our young 
men who are in training for the de- 
fense of our country. There is a 
list given of the various diseases 
and ailments which drive men into 
the hospitals each week — so many 
cases of pneumonia, so many cases 
of scarlet fever, so many cases of 
other diseases which affliict our 
boys — and among these, so many 
that enter the hospital on account 
of breaking of the laws of purity 
and virtue, an average perhaps of 
from 1200 to 1500 "of the latter 
class within the cantonments of the 
United States each week. I have 



taken occasion to notice the com- 
parison as between Camp Kearny 
and American Lake and other can- 
tonments throughout the country, 
as they compare with the entrance 
into the hospital from these causes ; 
and I rejoice to say that in these 
places where the men are assembled 
from these intermountain states 
and where the "Mormon" boys 
come from chiefly, that we find the 
lowest percentage of those who go 
into the hospitals from the breaking 
of the laws of virtue and personal 
morality. It is a testimony to me 
that the teachings of the parents 
have had effect in the lives of our 
young men, and that they have 
carried the principles of virtue and 
honesty and uprightness and honor 
into the service of their country. I 
rejoice that this is true. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
confidence and faith in the young 
men of Zion. I think they will not 
be recreant to the responsibility 
and obligations that are upon them, 
they will not bring disgrace upon 
their parents many of whom have 
come from foreign lands and es- 
tablished themselves in the tops of 
these mountains, and have taught 
correct principles to their children. 
I would be a .despicable character 
indeed were I recreant to the name 
of my honest old Scotch grand- 
father, the only one of a large fam- 
ily who was touched by the influ- 
ence of the spirit of the gospel, who 
left his home and friends and fam- 
ily, all that he had, for the gospel's 
sake, and came to this country. I 
would indeed be a despicable char- 
acter if I should be recreant to the 
memory of my grand-mother, who 
came from the highlands of Scot- 
land, and whose body was left in 
one of the temporary abiding places 



ELDER PETER G. JOHNSTON.

■of the Saints, in their journey to 
this land. I would be a despicable 
character indeed if I should be re- 
creant to the sacrifice made by my 
°Tand-father and my grand-mother 
in laying the foundation so that I 
might live here in peace and plen- 
ty, enjoying the society of the ser- 
— f s of God. As President Smith 
delivered that splendid testimony 
that here within these mountain 
fastnesses is the power and author- 
ity to act in the name of God, my 
soul was thrilled with the truth of 
his testimony, and I repeat it, and 
bear it unto you at this time, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER PETER G. JOHNSTON. 

(Of the Church Auditing Committee.) 

My brethren and sisters, in the 
humility of my heart, I earnestly 
desire your sympathy and faith, that 
I may speak the truth. 

This is an historic spot, the "gates 
of Zion," where 

Zion stands with hills surrounded — 
Zion, kept by power divine; 

All her foes shall be confounded, 
Though the world in arms com- 
bine; 

Happy Zion, happy Zion, 
What a favored lot is thine! 

and we will feel the inspiration of 
that verse and thank God that our 
lot is cast here. 

No doctrine or article of faith do 
we teach our children more sacredly 
than that the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence and the Constitution of 
this Country are inspired of God 
the eternal Father; and therefore 
they must of necessity square with 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
And it might be well to examine 
into the truth of that statement for 
a moment. For example, the cor- 



nerstone upon which American lib- 
erty is built, the very rock in which 
the flag staff of equal privileges is 
planted, are these words : 

We hold these truths to be self- 
evident, that all men are created 
equal; that they are endowed by their 
Creator with certain inalienable 
rights; that among these are life, lib- 
erty, and the pursuit of happiness; 
that, to secure these rights, govern- 
ments are instituted among men, de- 
riving their just powers from the con- 
sent of the governed. 

Look at that for a moment care- 
fully. "All men are created equal," 
say the fathers of the country, hold- 
ing it out as self-evident to every 
thinking man, making a statement 
that all the world, if they desired to 
candidly judge the cause of Amer- 
ica at that time, could see what was 
the truth. Well, is it true? Cer- 
tainly, as God lives it is true, and 
the Kaiser will discover it is true, 
and the powers of the earth have 
felt the truth of it, and they have 
said, as John Jaques said: 

The sceptre may fall from the despot's 
grasp, 

When with winds of stern justice he 
copes, 

But the pillar ,of truth will endure to 
the last, 

And its firm-rooted bulwarks out- 
stand the rude blast, 
And the wreck of the fell tyrant's 
hopes. 

Let him or any other autocrat or 
despot, listen to that, for anent that 
stands the doctrine declared by au- 
tocracy that God gives to one man 
the special right to rule others. That 
is not true, that comes from another 
source, with which we have in the 
past had to deal. 

There have been other wars than 
this, and we have taken part in one 
of them, in the heavens, when there 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



was presented to us the identical 
doctrine, not of German "kultur," 
but that we should be saved 
whether we would or no. And we 
said, "No, we reject the doctrine." 
Lucifer, the master of it, and the 
designer of it, with a third part or 
thereabouts of the hosts of heaven, 
were thrust out because of that au- 
tocratic feeling, that he wanted all 
the glory, and to save us whether 
we would or no. And we will thrust 
that doctrine out again, because we 
are free men ! 

Thank God for the declaration 
that all men are created equal and 
endowed by their Creator with 
these certain privileges. Oh, how 
magnificently that squares with the 
statement of the Prophet Joseph to 
Mr. Wentworth, when he asked for 
something that would express the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints. It 
begins this way: "We believe in 
God the Eternal Father." Yes, and 
the Declaration of Independence 
believes in the same truth and ad- 
vocates it to the work! ; and the 
framers of the Declaration, with a 
firm reliance upon divine Provi- 
dence for the support of that truth, 
pledged their all, including their 
sacred honor in its maintenance. It 
will stand, no matter what the cost, 
because God the Father has brought 
forth the truth in this land that" he 
prepared for the restoration of the 
law of human liberty, and the law 
of eternal liberty, the perfect law 
of liberty. The gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ must needs have such 
a government to come forward un- 
der, and for that reason, it was re- 
vealed and brought forth in this 
goodly land ; and, as has been said 
before, it can be said aagin, when 
the time comes in which the king- 
dom of God shall be^- rule upon 



the earth, the flag of this country, 
the flag representing liberty and 
equal rights, will proudly float in 
the breeze, hoisted aloft by those 
who have the power and right to 
defend its sanctity. 

There is an inspiration in the 
sight of your faces. There is the 
belief that comes from my heart, 
that I feel you realize and have the 
testimony of this great truth, that 
it is unto God the Eternal Father 
we look for protection. It has been 
declared in the history of this coun- 
try, as has already been made refer- 
ence to by one of the speakers, that 
no king shall ever reig'n upon this 
land, save He whose right it is to 
reign — provided, however, that the 
people of this land will fear God 
and give glory to him and serve 
him. It is not necessary to go into 
the sacred history of this country, 
the Book of Mormon, to find that 
spirit — it has permeated the leaders 
of this land and the men that God 
has raised up for the preservation 
of human liberty ; and the great 
Commoner, Lincoln, standing on 
Gettysburg, dedicating the field 
there for the resting place of those 
who had given their last full meas- 
ure — if yon will remember the 
words, the inspiration of them will 
come to you, when he said that it 
was "for us, the living" — think of 
it, whoever reads that will be those 
who live — "for us, the living, to ,see 
to it that this Nation, under God, 
shall have a new birth of freedom." 
He understood, he realized the ne- 
cessity of fearing God and giving 
glorv to him — and in the dedication 
of that field, and in the dedication 
of us to the purpose of the preser- 
vation of liberty in the earth, he 
benueathed to us the privilege of 
living under God, in order that the 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



149 



"government of the people" might 
'not perish from the earth. 

And the same inspiration comes 
down to this good day when the 
President of the United States said, 
"God helping, we can do none other 
than strive for the establishment of 
the principles that give us life." 
And in keeping with the same spirit, 
he said, ''the purpose is to make the 
world safe for this principle of 
equal rights." 

Latter-day Saints, of all people, 
have a right to feel grateful to Al- 
mighty God, and should live so that 
the inspiration and freedom of their 
lives from sin will bear testimony 
to the fact that we do have in keep- 
ing these .statements, these sacred 
revelations : for it is a wonderful 
thing for the Church to have the 
statement that Almighty God in- 
spired the framers of the Constitu- 
tion under which we live ; and we 
have that, it is contained in the 
101st section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. Wonderful ! Read it 
and get the fire of it. 

And oh, how thankful we should 
be: 

Thou hast led us here in safety, 
Where the mountain bulwark stands, 

As the g-uardian of the loved ones 
Thou hast brought from many lands: 

For the r,ock and for the river, 
The valley's fertile sod; 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God. 

Amen. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

(Of the Bureau of Information, Salt 
Lake City) 

My brethren and sisters and 
friends; this ,of course, as has been 
remarked by the other speakers, is a 



very inspiring sight ; and it occured 
to me while I was sitting here that 
if we could remember half we have 
heard, and put into practice even a 
tithe of the counsel and instruction 
given, that we had been amply paid 
for attending this conference. I re- 
joice in the good work. I rejoice 
with you, who are one with me in 
the same faith, in the instructions 
that we have recieved. And yet, it 
occurs to me that possibly in this 
vast audience there may be some 
who are strangers to our teachings, 
who understand not the doctrines 
as taught by us, who have not re- 
ceived into their hearts the testi- 
monies borne by our elders. 

It is my province to be here daily, 
meeting strangers who are not of 
our faith. I often think, no matter 
how large the congregation, there 
are some of that class amongst us ; 
and it may be there are some right 
here. We distribute our literature 
very freely to them. We hand out 
our tracts, sell them the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants, the Pearl of Great Price. 
What effect it has upon them we 
little know. We are casting bread 
upon the waters, and we have the 
utmost faith in the truth that it will 
be seen after many .days. 

A few days ago, however, I re- 
ceived a letter from the Northwest, 
which I refer to my friend, Pres- 
ident Ballard, who goes back there. 
Some of our friends who have been 
here have scattered the literature 
abroad, and I am going to take the 
liberty, therefore of reading this 
letter to show the effect that it may 
have upon some. After saying that 
the letter is from so-and-so, and 
giving -the address — giving the 
number and the street and the 
town — the letter commences, "We 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



do not want any more of your 
tracts. The Holy Ghost .dwells in 
this home, and we have no room 
for the doctrine of men and devils. 
We believe in a real communion 
with the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost. Praise the Lord!" 

Now, I suppose to the Latter-day 
Saints who are here, that that 
appears very foolish. I want to 
appeal, however, to Saint and sin- 
ner who have been here this after- 
noon :Have you heard the doctrine 
of men and devils in this meeting? 
I appeal to those who have had our 
literature, who have read our tracts, 
who have sought to understand why 
we believe in God the Eternal 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ 
and in the Holy Ghost, you who 
have known that the "Mormons" 
believe in faith, repentance, baptism 
by immersion for the remission of 
sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by 
the laying on of hands, the priest- 
hood that exists amongst us, men 
having recieved authority to minis- 
ter in the things of God, holding 
the Aaronic or the Melchizedek 
priesthood, laying hands upon the 
sick that they may recover, sending 
their Sons and daughters into all 
parts of the world to preach the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ — in 
all of this, have you detected any of 
the doctrines of men and devils ? 

But I appeal to you with regard 
to one statement in the letter that I 
have referred to : "We believe in 
the real communion with God the 
Father and the Son and the Holy 
Ghost." I make the declaration 
here, and every Latter-day Saint 
can say amen to it, that nowhere 
upon the face of God's earth is 
there a people who have had more 
communing with the Father, with 
the Son, with the Holy Ghost than 



the Latter-day Saints. What does 
the man want? What does the- 
world want more than it has al- 
ready received? We declare in all 
soberness that in this day God has 
given to us a prophetjoseph Smith. 
We 'declare that when but a boy he 
went out into the woods to pray, 
and that he recieved a revelation 
from God. The Father appeared 
unto him, Jesus Christ appeared 
unto him, they talked with him. Can 
any man have a more real com- 
munion with God than that ? We be- 
lieve that God has manifested him- 
self to his prophet, that through 
that prophet he has given unto us 
the authority, and that through his 
labors we have recieved the Church 
of God. 

Now then, in this conference, 
from the begining, on Friday 
morning, up to the present time, 
have you received anything that is 
calculated to inspire you to go on 
with the work of God? I have felt 
the very blood in my veins tingling 
as I listened to the prophets of God. 
I have vowed more fervently before 
God that I would live nearer to 
him, that I would endeaver to keep 
his commandments, that my life 
should be a testimony of the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. These are 
the feelings that we have had in our 
meetings, you have had them. Now, 
what are we going to do ? This con- 
ference is nearly over. You are 
going to the various wards and 
stakes of Zion, and in going there, 
I exhort you, my brethren, sustain 
the brethren who have given you 
these instructions, let your hands 
be raised, let your hearts send forth 
prayers, that God will bless all 
Israel. I think we have a splendid 
example in Holy Writ. Let me re- 
fer to it. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES H. HART.

There was a time in the days of 
ancient Israel when they had strug- 
gles just as we are having now. The 
time was when all Israel had to go 
forth to battle. You are familiar, no 
doubt, with the travels of Israel to- 
ward the promised land. I draw 
your attention to Just one story. 
When in the midst of their afflic- 
tion, when they were beset by en- 
emies, when they were going out 
through the lands of the heathens, 
Moses, the leader of Israel, said to 
his commander in chief, who was 
going out to battle, "Joshua, choose 
out men, go out, fight with the 
Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand 
on the top of the hill with the rod 
of God in my hand." And Joshua 
went out to fight, and Moses went 
up onto the hill, and it came to pass 
that as the hands of Moses got 
weary and began to lower, on ac- 
count of his age, and on account 
of the time, that the Amalekites 
prevailed over Israel ; but Aaron 
and Hur came to his side. They 
placed a rock for him to sit upon, 
one on each ,side, they held up his 
arms, and as long as those arms 
were extended to heaven, Israel 
prevailed, the heathen were des- 
troyed, and those hands were raised 
until the going down of the sun, 
and victory came to them. 

I have only one thought in this — 
when you go to your homes, when 
we all go to our homes, let us get 
upon our knees. "Not to your tents, 
O Israel : to your knees, O Israel !" 
With one voice raise your hands to 
heavens and pray that God will 
sustain the president of this 
Church, the apostles who are with 
him, all who are laboring to build 
up Zion, and let us feel, with one 
heart with one mind, that we are 
maintaining them in their position 



as prophets, seers, and revelators. 
Go to our homes, yes, and pray 
that God will bless the President 
of this Nation, the Cabinet, all who 
are endeavoring to maintain this 
struggle for freedom ! To our 
homes, yes, and upon our knees 
pray that God will bless our boys, 
to guide them in their struggles, 
and send them home again ! 
God bless you. Amen.

duty, and sustain our country to the 
uttermost. 

This is one of the mo.st stationary 
and attentive outdoor audiences I 
think I have ever seen. You have 
listened with great interest to the 
important topics that have been pre- 
sented to you this afternoon. I am 
sure that we have rejoiced, those of 
us who have attended these confer- 
ence meetings, in the spirit and 
teachings of these meetings. I 
thought this morning in viewing 
the beautiful decorations of the 
Tabernacle with the national colors, 
how appropriate it is to have so dec- 
orated a hall, at a conference meet- 
ing in which an appropriation of a 
quarter of a million was made for 
the purchase of Government bonds ! 

I have rejoiced in the references 
we have had made by various of the 
brethren to the fact that the Con- 
stitution of the United States was 
an inspired document. I want to 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



testify to the conviction that that is 
true, a conviction reached by me 
not only from a belief in the revela- 
tion which so informs us, but also 
from a knowledge of the document 
and a historical .study of its forma- 
tion. [\ 
Had the document not been in- 
spired, that grand old statesman of 
England, Premier Gladstone, would 
not have said that it was the great- 
est document ever struck off at a 
given time by the brain and purpose 
of man. 

Had those delegates not been in- 
spired, another jurist of our land 
would not have said of them that 
it' was "the goodliest fellowship of 
law givers whereof this world has 
record." 

Had those men not been inspired, 
Lord Bryce, the author of The 
American Commonwealth, would 
not have paid the splendid tribute 
that he does to the Constitution, 
giving the characteristic and under- 
lying principles of it in substan- 
tially the same way as they are 
given in that revelation referred to 
by Brother Johnston, the 101st Sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
commencing at about the 79th verse, 
showing the purpose of the Consti- 
tution, that men might be free, that 
they might have their free agency, 
and be responsible. 

Some think that the distinguish- 
ing characteristic of the Constitu- 
tion of the United States was its 
bill of rights. That is not true. The 
essential rights set forth in our bill 
of rights were known to mankind 
from an early day, from the time 
when the barons at Runnymede 
forced old King John to give them 
Magna Charta ; and it was known in 
those various charters of English 
liberty which we inherited as Amer- 



ican citizens, and which we brought 
with us as a birthright and a her- 
itage when we came to this coun- 
try. But the distinguishing thing, 
the pioneer work that was done by 
these delegates, was in declaring 
the fact that governments derive 
their just powers from the consent 
of the governed ; and that is a prin- 
ciple that I think the Lord has de- 
sired that his people should adopt 
in the various ages of the world. 

You read the Old Testament, I 
Samuel 8, where the people were 
desirous of having a king. Read 
what Samuel says to theim He is 
pointing out here some of the things 
that make it undesirable for them 
to have a king: 

And he [Samuel] said, This will be 
the manner of the king that shall 
reign over you: he will take your sons, 
and appoint them for himself, for his 
chariots, and to be his horsemen; and 
they shall run before his chariots: and 
he will appoint them unto him for 
captains of thousands, and captains of 
fifties; and he will set some to plow 
his ground, and to reap his harvest, 
and to make his instruments of war, 
and the instruments of his chariots. 
And he will take your daughters to be 
confectionaries, and to be cooks, and 
to be bakers. And he will take your 
fields, and your vineyards, and your 
oliveyards, even the best of them, and 
give them to his servants. And he 
will take the tenth of your seed, and 
of your vineyards, and give to his 
officers, and to his servants. And he 
will take your menservants, and your 
maidservants, and your goodliest 
young men, and your asses, and put 
them to his work. He will take the 
tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be 
his servants. And ye shall cry out in 
that day because of your king which ye 
shall have chosen you; and the Lord 
will not answer you in that day. 

There are some very striking 
things here in the Book of Mosiah. 
I had my attention called to it this 



PRESIDENT CHARLES H. HART. i;3 



morning afresh. In the 29th chap- 
ter of Mosiah, when Mo.siah grows 
old, and his sons have abused the 
trusts of government reposed in 
them, and the people desire a king, 
Mosiah says to them : 

Now I say unto you, that because 
all men are not just, it is not expe- 
dient that ye should have a king or 
kings to rule over you. 

For behold, how much iniquity doth 
one wicked king cause to be com- 
mitted! yea, and what great destruc- 
tion! 

Yea, remember king Noah, his wick- 
edness and his abominations; and also 
the wickedness and abominations of 
his people. Behold what great de- 
struction did come upon them; and 
also because of their iniquities, they 
were brought into bondage. 

And were it not for the interposi- 
tion of their all-wise Creator, and this 
because of their sincere repentance, 
they must unavoidably remain in 
bondage until now. 

But behold, he did deliver them be- 
cause they did humble themselves be- 
fore him; and because they cried 
mightily unto him, he did deliver them 
out of bondage; and thus doth the 
Lord work with his power in all cases 
among the children of men, extending 
the arm of mercy towards them that 
put their trust in him. 

And behold, now I say unto you, ye 
cannot dethrone an iniquitous king, 
save it be through much contention, 
and the shedding of much blood. 

For behold, he has his friends in 
iniquity, and he keepeth his guards 
about him: and he teareth up the laws 
of those who have reigned in right- 
eousness before him: and he trampleth 
under his feet the commandments of 
God; 

And he enacteth laws, and sendeth 
them forth among his people; yea, 
laws after the manner of his own 
wickedness; and whosoever doth not 
obey his laws, he causeth to be de- 
stroyed; and whosoever doth rebel 
against him, he will send his armies 
against them to war, and if he can, 
he will destroy them: and thus an un- 
righteous king doth pervert the ways 
of all righteousness. 



There is more along the same 
line. Read on to the 32nd verse, 
and then the 38 and 39th verses, 
showing the outcome of the matter, 
whereby the people selected judges 
to rule over them. 

I have rejoiced in the teachings 
of the conference which will enable 
us to be strong and steadfast in the 
work which lies before us. On the 
matters in which our nation is in- 
volved, some plain things have been 
said. The truth is that a military 
system has developed which has dis- 
regarded the last half (the last five) 
of the Ten Commandments. Very 
largely, at least, their system stands 
for the disregard of those com- 
mandments. While the world slept, 
nor dreamed that there was great 
danger for the people, this military 
caste looked out over the land of 
their neighbors to the north to the 
Baltic, to the south to the Mediter- 
ranean, and to the west to the Eng- 
lish Channel ; and f orgot the com- 
mandment, "Thou shaft not steal." 
And in planning to extend the bor- 
ders of their country, they forgot 
also the other commandment, 
"Thou shalt not kill," and the com- 
mandment — in their system of es- 
pionage in other nations, particu- 
larly active just now in Mexico — 
"Thou shalt not bear false witness 
against thy neighbor." And other 
commandments their soldiers have 
disregarded in their work of taking 
forcible possession of those lands. 

When we read the story of the 
outrage upon Belgium, of the hun- 
dreds of thousands of Armenians 
who have lost their lives, of the 
awful tragedy in Rumania, and of 
that great highway along which the 
Polish Russian refugees passed, 
leaving now a highway carpeted 
with the rags from their clothing 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and the small baskets which once 
held"" little babes — and the .small 
bones only of fingers and toes, the 
large bones having been gathered 
up, so the correspondent tells us, 
for phosphates and fertilizers ! 
When we think of these things and 
sense the responsibility upon us as 
our "brother's keeper" — in a way 
we realize the necessity for our po- 
sition today. You say war is wrong, 
but it is because war is wrong that 
we are making war. We remained 
out of this as long as we could and 
maintain our self-respect. We had 
been taught as American citizens 
that an American citizen had rights 
which should be respected every- 
where. The Supreme Court, at an 
early date had announced that prin- 
ciple — that an American citizen, 
whether upon the high seas or upon 
foreign lands, had rights which 
other nations were bound to respect. 
When we saw the rights of Amer- 
ican citizens disregarded, as in such 
instances as the sinking of the 
Lusitania; and after a promise 
against ruthless submarine warfare 
and a system of destruction of the 
lives and property of our citizens 
resumed — the only thing that we 
could do and remain true to our 
traditions and the heritages of the 
past, and retain our self-respect, 
was to do as our government has 
done. 

The President of the United 
States said yesterday, among other 
things : 

Germany has once more said that 
force and force alone shall decide 
whether justice and peace shall reign 
in the affairs of men, whether right, 
as America conceives it, or dominion, 
as she conceives it, shall determine 
the destinies of mankind. There is, 
therefore, but one response possible 
form us, Force, force to the utmost, 



force without stint or limit — the right- 
eous force which shall make right the 
law of the world and cast every selfish 
dominion in the dust. 

Therefore, it is that we stand 
against the system which enables 
men, full-grown men to drop bombs 
upon sleeping babes and upon sleep- 
ing communities, to destroy help- 
less women and noncombatant men, 
and we realize the responsibility 
that rests with us. In the language 
of our national hymn : 

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was 

born across the sea, 
With the glory in his bosom that 

transfigures you and me: 
As He died to make men holy, let us 

die to make men free. 

May the Lord bless the proceed- 
ings of this conference — those who 
have come up here, that the words 
that have been given here may be 
borne home to the people ; that we 
may return to our homes with a de- 
termination to do our utmost as 
citizens of the United States to de- 
fend the heritages which we have. 
With us it is a religious duty as well 
as a civic obligation to sustain our 
country to the uttermost. And may 
the Lord help us do this, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

After the singing of the "Dox- 
ology," benediction was pronounced 
by Bishop Percy Goddard. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle the conference

direction of Elder. J. Golden Kim- 
ball, of the First Council of Sev- 
enty; and in the open air meeting- 
near the Bureau of Information 
Building, under direction of Elder 
Charles H. Hart, of the First Coun- 
cil of Seventy. 

The choir sang-, "For the strength 
of the hills we bless the, our God, 
our father's God," music by Evan 
Stephens. 

Prayer was offered by Elder E. J. 
Wood, President of the Alberta, 
Canada, stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the anthem : 
"Watching over Israel." 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

Blessings and advantages of the gos- 
pel — Tunning to God because of the 
war — Are the people observing his 
commandments-? — Restrictions and 
conservation are means of teaching 
righteousness — Is this means being 
taken advantage of? — A warning 
voice to the Latter-day Saints — The 
office and calling- of prophets and 
teachers. 

I have but one desire this after- 
. noon and that is to add my testi- 
mony to the testimonies that have 
already been given at the sessions 
of this conference, to the truth of 
this great latter-day work, and to 
testify that I know, as my brethren 
who have spoken have testified, that 
Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph 
Smith was and is a prophet of God 
who was called, raised up and filled 
with the Spirit of the Lord that he 
might establish in the world the 
truth of the everlasting- gospel 
which for so many hundreds of 
years had been absent from the 
earth, because of the transgressions 
of the people. It was the purpose 
of the Lord in calling- Joseph Smith 
to warn the people, to call them unto 
repentance, and bring them into the 



fold, if they would come, where 
they could obtain all the necessary 
privileg-es, blessings and advantages 
belonging to the gospel before the 
great and dreadful day of the Lord 
should come. The Lord has always 
raised up prophets when prophets 
were needed, to teach the people, 
warn them of threatened dangers 
and give them the knowledge, 
through repentance, by which they 
might escape. It became necessary 
therefore in the dispensation of the 
fulness of time and before the com- 
ing of the Son of God, for the gos- 
pel to be restored, the nations of 
the earth to be warned, and every 
man to have the privilege of ac- 
cepting the truth or rejecting it. 

Permit me to read a few passages 
of scripture from a revelation that 
was given over eighty-six years 
ago, a revelation that was given to 
the world for the benefit of all the, 
children of our Father in heaven. 
I read from the first section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants where the 
Lord says : 

Hearken, O ye people of my 
church, saith the voice of him who 
dwells on high, and whose eyes are 
upon all men; yea, verily I say, 
hearken, ye people from afar, and ye 
that are upon the islands of the sea, 
listen together. 

For verily the voice of the Lord is 
unto all men, and there is none to es- 
cape, and there is no eye that shalr 
•not see, neither .ear that shall not 
hear, neither heart that shall not be 
penetrated. 

And the rebellious shall be pierced 
with much sorrow, for their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the housetops, 
and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people^ by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in 
these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none 
shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We learn from the very first 
verse which I have read that this 
warning is primarily to the mem- 
bers of the Church. The Church 
had only been organized a little 
more than a year and a half, for 
this revelation was given on the 
first day of November, in the year 
1831. The Lord speaks first unto 
his people and ,says unto them, 
"Hearken, O ye people of my 
church." Then he goes on to tell 
what shall befall the nations of the 
earth, all peoples, every kinderd 
and tongue, provided they reject 
the testimony of his servants ; and 
this warning is not only unto the 
Latter-day Saints, the members of 
the Church, but unto all the world, 
but I say first, unto the members of 
the Church, because we have come 
out of the world and have made 
covenant in the waters of baptism 
Jhat we will ,serve the Lord and 
keep his commandments. I wonder 
after the passing of eighty-six 
years and upwards if there is not 
room even in Zion for repentance. 

I was very pleased to hear one 
of our mission presidents declare 
that from his observation he could 
report that the people within the 
borders of these United States, be- 
cause of the troubles now coming 
upon the earth, were turning unto 
God. It was very pleasing to me to 
know that their hearts are being 
touched. While he spoke I won- 
dered if our hearts are being 
touched as they should be, and if we 
are repenting of our transgressions, 
our follies, our imperfections, and 
if we are putting forth a greater 
effort to serve the Lord now than 
ever before? If not, then let me 
say to you who are here assembled, 
and I pray you to carry the word to 
those who are not here assembled 



who belong to the Church, that it 
is the will of the Lord that his peo- 
ple hearken unto this command- 
ment from which I have read and 
from which I expect to read still 
more, and observe and obey all his 
commandments. 

Are we observing the Word of 
Wisdom? Are we abstaining from 
the use of those things forbidden 
of the Lord which are injurious to 
our health? Are we faithful in the 
•discharge of our duties as members 
of the Church, in the attendance at 
meetings, both priesthood and sac- 
ramental, and all other meetings 
which it is our privilege and duty 
to attend? Are we true and faith- 
ful to the law of tithing as it has 
been given unto us, and which is, 
if you please, a preparatory doc- 
trine, given as a schoolmaster to 
lead us unto the higher law, or are 
we neglectful of our opportunities 
in this regard? Are we faithful in 
remembering our prayers before 
the Lord day by day, not only our 
secret prayers, but our prayers in 
family organization, in the family 
circle ? Are we in possession of the 
spirit of prayer? Have we made it 
a part of our very being? Are we 
in touch with our heavenly Father 
through the Holy Spirit, or are we 
not? And so I could go on and 
enumerate other principles of the 
gospel and other duties, if time 
would permit, but this will suffice. 
The thing I want to impress upon 
the minds of the Latter-day Saints 
is this : that perilous times have 
come. As we heard in the singing 
of the choir, the tares and the wheat 
are growing together and have 
been growing in the same field for 
all these years, but the day is near 
at hand when the wheat will be gar- 
nered, and the tares likewise will

be gathered to be burned, and there 
will come a separation, the right- 
eous from the wicked, and it be- 
hooves each one of us to keep the 
commandments of the Lord, to re- 
pent of our sins, to turn unto right- 
eousness, if there is need of re- 
pentance in our hearts. 

Now, let me read again a verse 
which I have already read : 

And the rebellious shall be pierced 
with much sorrow, for their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the housetops, 
and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be 
unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in 
these last days. 

Now again: 

Wherefore, the voice ,of the Lord is 
unto the ends of the earth, that all 
that will hear may hear: 

Prepare ye, prepare ye for that 
which is to come, for the Lord is 
nigh; 

And the ano-er of the LorcLjs kin- 
dled, and his sword is bathed in 
heaven, and it shall fall upon the in- 
habitants of the earth; 

And the arm of the Lord shall be 
revealed; and the day cometh that 
they who will n,ot hear the voice of 
the Lord, neither the voice of his 
servants, neither give heed to the 
words of the prophets and apostles, 
shall be cut off from among the 
people. 

Now, that is the word of the 
Lord. This declaration is not mine, 
but I declare it unto you in words 
of soberness as being' the truth 
which will prevail, and there is rea- 
son for us to seek the Lord and be 
more sober in our minds and in our 
actions than we have m the past. 

Again, I was thinking when our 
brother spoke of the condition in 
the world wherein the people are 
becoming more humble than they 
were before the breaking out of the 



war, and I wondered if they are 
turning from their Sabbath break- 
ing — their excess of pleasure seek- 
ing on the Lord's day? I thought 
that this Government of ours is 
overlooking one of its most impor- 
tant duties in this hour of conserva- 
tion, wherein they are restricting 
us, necessarily, perhaps, in what 
we shall eat, in what we shall wear ; 
restricting the railroads in their 
transportation, the merchants in 
that which they shall buy and sell ; 
and when they are taking charge of 
various other branches of industry. 
It struck me that they are overlook- 
ing one of the most important 
things that ought to be considered 
by the leaders of the Nation for the 
purpose of bringing to pass right- 
eous peace and a successful ending 
of the war. That is they have for- 
gotten or have overlooked their op- 
portunity to restrict the people in 
their amusements and their Sabbath 
breaking, and teach them right- 
eousness. Oh, what an opportunity 
there is, in all this restriction and 
conservation, to conserve faithful- 
ness and humility before the Lord, 
if they would only require of the 
people to do so ; but as we find, on 
the Sabbath day, which has been set 
apart by the Lord our God as a day 
on which we should worship him, 
the theatres, the places of amuse- 
ment and recreation throughout 
this land from one end to the other, 
are filled and overflowing. The peo- 
ple are seeking pleasure, and there 
is still room for a great repentance. 
The Lord would be more inclined 
to hear the cries of the people of 
this land and aid them in the pres- 
ent awful struggle, if they would 
repent and worship him. But all 
this has been overlooked ! 

I want to raise the warning voice 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to the Latter-day Saints and say to 
them that it is the will of the Lord, 
and I think I dare say so, that they 
should be more sober-minded as 
well as industrious, and should 
spend more time and give more at- 
tention to the things of the king- 
dom of God and less to the things 
of the world and the seeking of 
pleasure in this hour of trouble. 
Before we are through I fear we 
will be sobered. 

Now, I will read again : 

Nevertheless, he that repents and 
does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

And he that repents not, from him 
shall be taken even the light which 
he has received, for my Spirit shall 
■not always strive with man, saith the 
Lord of Hosts. 

And again, verily I say unto you, O 
inhabitants of the earth, T the Lord 
am willing to make these things 
known unto all flesh, 

For I am no respecter of persons, 
and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh; the hour is 
not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 
peace shall be taken from the earth, 
and the devil shall have power over 
his own dominion; 

Remember this revelation was 
given over eighty-six years ago; 
again : 

And also the Lord, shall have power 
over his saints, and shall reigrn in their 
midst, and shall come down in judg- 
ment upon Idumea, or the world. 

Search these commandments for 
they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in 
them shall all be fulfilled. 

What I the Lord have spoken, I 
have spoken, and I excuse not my- 
self: and though the heavens and the 
earth pass away, my word shall not 
pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, 
whether by mine own voice or by the 
voice of my servants, it is the same. 

Now, just another passage from 
this same section : 



Wherefore I, the Lord, knowing the 
calamity which should come upon the 
inhabitants of the earth, called upon 
my servant Joseph Smith, jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and 
gave him commandments; 

And also gave commandments to 
others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all 
this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets; 

The weak things of the world shall 
come forth and break down the 
mighty and strong .ones, that man 
shall not counsel his fellow man, 
neither trust in the arm of flesh, 

But that every man might speak in 
the name of God the Lord, even the 
Savior of the world; 

That faith also might increase in 
the earth." 

The Lord called Joseph Smith, 
and gave unto him his mission, and 
those who were associated with 
him, to teach the world the princi- 
ples of the gospel. The Lord has 
declared, as I have read it to you 
here, that if the people refuse to 
hear the voice of his servants, and 
the prophets, they shall be cut off 
from among the people. 

Well now, who is a prophet ? The 
world has a very peculiar notion of 
what a prophet is. They think 
that the whole duty of a prophet is 
merely to foretell what is going to 
take place, that prophecy is the re- 
lating of future events, but that is 
only one of the duties of a prophet. 
I am reminded of a circumstance 
that took place in Israel in the days 
of Moses when he and seventy of 
the elders went unto the tabernacle 
to converse with the Lord and they 
prophesied. Two of the elders 
who were not with the others but 
remained in the camp, also received 
the spirit of prophecy, and uttered 
predictions and preached the truth 
without a doubt. Joshua — a man 
who himself was filled with wis- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE

dom, when the Lord through Moses 
called him to be the leader of the 
people — seeing that these men were 
prophesying, complained to Moses 
and demanded that he stop them. 
Moses' reply was : "Enviest thou 
for my sake?" Would God that all 
the Lord's people were prophets, 
and that the Lord would put his 
spirit upon them !" Then I read 
again in the nineteenth chapter of 
the book of Revelation, in that same 
passage of scripture that was re- 
ferred to by Brother Ivins this 
morning, where the angel of the 
Lord declared to John that the tes- 
timony of Jesus is the spirit of 
prophecy; and the Prophet Joseph 
Smith has declared that every man 
who has come into this Church ; 
and every woman, for that matter, 
who has received the testimony of 
the Spirit of the Lord, is a prophet 
or a prophetess ; that every man 
should be a prophet, because every 
man in the Church should have the 
testimony of Jesus which is the 
spirit of prophecy; and he .should 
declare the truth, teach the princi- 
ples of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, call upon the people to re- 
pent of their sins, and instruct them 
in the things of the kingdom. This 
is the duty of a prophet and con- 
stitutes the office and calling of a 
prophet just as much as the declara- 
tion of things which are yet to 
come. Now, these things are true. 

The Lord bless you and guide 
you, my brethren and sisters, in the 
truth. May we seek for the tes- 
timony of the Spirit of God and 
become filled with the testimony of 
Jesus, that we can declare to the 
world that he is the Son of God and 
the Redeemer of mankind ; and 
when we can do that in words of 
soberness, we are prophets and we 



are prophetesses. Now, remember 
that. The Lord bless you, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

The last days — 'The gospel older than

er than any book — Need of a living 
Priesthood — A testimony to current

Verily these are the last days, the 
days seen by seers, predicted by 
prophets, proclaimed by revelators 
throughout the ages, and affirmed 
by the representatives of God in 
this current dispensation. In these 
days events develop rapidly. As on 
the mimic stage action increases, 
and in the working out of the plot 
and plan developments occur with 
bewildering rapidity as the finale 
approaches, so in the great drama 
of God on the stage of the world, 
the purpose of the great Master is 
being made plain through the por- 
tentous events of the current day. 
By the "last days" we do not mean 
the end of time. Such a concept 
indeed is impossible to the human 
mind. Duration is of necessity eter- 
nal, just as space is unbounded. So 
with respect to the gospel of Christ 
and its effects ; this gospel is eter- 
nal and its extent unbounded. 

Bible students recognize that 
Israel lived under the law, and that 
Christ brought the gospel which 
superseded the law, and they have 
drawn a wholly incorrect inference, 
namely, that the law is in fact older 
than the gospel. Be it known that 
the gospel, so far as this earth and 
its inhabitants are concerned, dates

from Adam. Unto him was taught 
the necessity of faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, not merely mental be- 
lief, but abiding, impelling, living 
faith, the necessity of repentance, 
the indispensability of baptism in 
water by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins, the indispensability of 
the bestowal of the Holy Ghost. 
These principles and ordinances 
were taught unto Adam, adminis- 
tered unto him, and by him were 
taught and administered to others. 
So was it also with Enoch, with 
Noah, with Abraham, with Moses, 
and with the hosts of God's right- 
eous servants in the early dispensa- 
tions, who in many instances laid 
down their lives in defense of the 
principles which they promulgated. 

No, the gospel did not begin upon 
earth in the meridian of time. 
There had been gospel dispensa- 
tions before, and there had been 
widespread apostasies from the 
truths declared in those several dis- 
pensations. The great apostasy 
following the apostolic ministry 
was not the first. There was an 
apostasy in the days of Noah, and 
the people suffered therefrom in 
their disembodied state, until in the 
Lord's due time He went unto them 
and offered the principles of the 
gospel by which they could in a 
measure make amends. 

One of the inherent weaknesses 
of the human mind is that of reach- 
ing after completeness. We like 
to feel that we can begin and end 
a subject of study. We are like 
those thoughtless students in school 
who seem to think that all that is 
known about the subject is to be 
found within the covers of their 
text book; and a reprehensible but 
still somewhat popular custom pre- 
vails in some of the colleges on 
the part of the classes who finish 



the study of some book, to hold a 
cremation ceremony and burn up 
the texts as evidence that they have 
no further use for them ; they think 
they know the whole thing. 

We have learned the solemn 
truth that the gospel is greater 
than any book, greater than the 
Bible, indispensable though that 
volume is ; greater than the Book 
of Mormon, great as is the mission 
of that Scripture, brought to the 
world in these latter days by the 
power and inspiration of God ; 
greater than our current volume of 
modern revelation, for there is 
more to come. More is included in 
the gospel than all Scripture thus 
far written ; and the living oracles 
are established in the Church to 
give unto the people from time to 
time the mind and the will of God 
in addition to what has been placed 
upon record with relation to the 
ages past. We have yet to find the 
first discrepancy, the first instance 
of inconsistency, of lack of har- 
mony between the Scriptures that 
are given unto the people by those 
who speak in the name and by the 
power of the living God, and those 
words that are written of similar 
ministry in by-gone times. 

What, some may ask, are we not 
told that we have the fulness of 
the gospel ? Verily so. When Mo- 
roni came to announce to Joseph 
Smith the existence of the record 
from which Joseph was afterwards 
to translate, by the gift and power 
of God, the volume known to us as 
the Book of Mormon, Moroni de- 
clared unto him that that book 
contained the fulness of the ever- 
lasting gospel, as made known unto 
the people in their age; but "ful- 
ness" is relative, even as perfec- 
tion is. Many have stumbled over 
that admonition of Christ, "Be ye 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



161 



perfect even as your Father which 
is in heaven is perfect." Men have 
asked : How can that be ? We are 
not like Him ; we are still mortal, 
with all our frailties. Even those 
who believe in the eternal progres- 
sion of man so reason, so argue, 
and they would make out that 
Christ uttered fable and fiction ; for 
to so admonish in the face of im- 
possibility would be nothing less. 
But Christ told the people in that 
day, and He has repeated the ad- 
monition and injunction unto us : 
Be perfect in the sense in which 
your Father in heaven is perfect. 
What man calls "perfection" is 
after all comparative. Plainly a 
man in mortality cannot be perfect 
in power nor in influence nor in 
righteousness, in all details in the 
sense in which God the Father and 
His Son Jesus Christ are perfect. 
Both of Them are resurrected men, 
both of Them have passed through 
conditions strictly analogous to 
those of mortality through which 
we are passing, both of whom have 
died, both of whom have been res- 
urrected, both of whom are glori- 
fied, supremely so. In the sense in 
which They are perfect you and I 
cannot aspire to be so here in the 
flesh. But we can be perfect if we 
will in our sphere, as They are 
perfect in Their sphere; and per- 
fection in the lesser is the great- 
est possible preparation for perfec- 
tion in the greater. 

So with respect to the fulness of 
the gospel. That expression is rel- 
ative. Unto the Nephites was giv- 
en a fulness of the gospel as it ap- 
plied to them, embracing and em- 
bodying the fundamental principles 
and ordinances and blessings aris- 
ing therefrom, uncounted and in- 
numerable ; but nevertheless, there 
is much more in the gospel, in its 



possibilities, in the blessings which 
it holds in store, that shall yet be 
made known unto man. We recog- 
nize the varied offices in the priest- 
hood, and we know something of 
the functions connected with each, 
but there are functions of which we 
have not yet learned, but of which 
we shall learn hereafter. The pow- 
ers and functions of the Holy 
Priesthood, as manifested in mor- 
tality today, are but as the foot- 
hills compared with the towering 
peaks beyond. The priesthood is 
eternal, and therefore when it is 
conferred carries with it the pos- 
sibilities of this endless progres- 
sion, development and expansion. 
When shall we have more ? God 
grant that we receive it not until 
we are well prepared for it, for 
many of us have not yet learned 
to live up to what we have re- 
ceived, and if we receive and re- 
ject, we bring ourselves under con- 
demnation. 

I have met here and there a dis- 
gruntled one, one who is saying: 
Why don't we receive further reve- 
lation from God today? We are 
receiving it day by day. I speak 
of what I know when I say unto 
you, if ever the Church of Christ 
was led by a prophet enjoying com- 
munion with God, inspiration from 
the source of divine revelation, 
from heaven direct — and none of us 
can doubt such leadership in the 
past — this day witnesses that con- 
dition. I testify unto you that the 
man who stands at the head of this 
Church is the mouthpiece of God 
unto His people, and if we fail to 
heed his words, his admonitions, 
his instructions given unto us as 
they have been, and are, in love and 
nevertheless with firmness and with 
no uncertainty of tone, we bring 
ourselves under condemnation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We recognize in the events of 
the present day the very conditions 
that were foreseen and foretold. 
Do yon not remember how anxious 
and eager the eleven apostles were 
of old to win from Christ some def- 
inite expression as to when He 
would come? Before His cruci- 
fixion, before His betrayal, the 
Twelve seemed to be equally con- 
cerned, whatever may have been 
the personal condition of the mind 
of Judas, and they asked Him : 
"When shall these things be, and 
what shall be the sign of thy com- 
ing?" The Lord warned them 
against men who would set dates, 
and that warning has never been 
abrogated, but, on the contrary, has 
been repeated and emphasized. I 
say unto you, beware of the men 
who undertake to set the year and 
the day in which the Christ shall 
come, for that has not been revealed 
unto man. Nevertheless, Christ did 
give certain signs and conditions 
which would indicate the imminence 
of His coming, and one of the most 
remarkable was this : He told of 
wars ; He told of the awful trag- 
edies that should come upon the 
earth, and, with respect to all these, 
He said "the end is not yet." Then 
having explained further He said : 
"And this gospel of the kingdom 
shall be preached in all the world 
for a witness unto all nations ; and 
then shall the end come." 

This Church has been preaching 
that gospel. It has not yet com- 
pleted its commission. It was so 
engaged most earnestly, and is en- 
gaged most devoutly to the extent, 
I believe, of its means, condition, 
and attendant circumstances. Be- 
fore the outbreak of this great con- 
flict it maintained a standing army 
of approximately two thousand, a 
very small army compared with the 



needs, but approximately two thou- 
sand men in the world, crying re- 
pentance, warning the people of the 
calamities that were to come, cry- 
ing: "Come out of her,, that ye par- 
take not of her plagues." Many 
heard and believed and are here. 
Many heard and scoffed, and have 
remained. Now, not all the good 
were taken, and not all who were 
left are bad ; but there were those 
who had faith enough to lay hold 
on the blessing placed within their 
reach, and to come out into this 
land of relative safety, and of great 
blessing, the land in which the 
Lord has spoken and from which 
has gone out the word of God unto 
the nations. 

I would have the Latter-day 
Saints consider the fact that of all 
peoples on the face of the earth we 
are peculiarly interested in the out- 
come of this struggle. Therefore 
we have a sound foundation in this 
for our patriotism, for our sacri- 
fice, for our efforts in behalf of 
this government, for our unquali- 
fied allegiance to the Constitution 
of the United States, which is ver- 
itably the scripture of the nation ; 
for upon this Church has been laid 
the commission to preach the gospel 
in every nation as a witness. How 
can we do this when the doors of 
the nations are barred and bolted? 
To discharge this commission we 
must have freedom ; there must be 
freedom of speech, freedom of the 
press, and above all, freedom of 
conscience, ever remembering that 
freedom means real liberty in 
righteousness, and not license to 
do wrong. Therefore we Latter- 
day Saints are praying, and not 
only in words but in deeds, that vic- 
tory may attend the arms that have 
been taken up in the vindication of 
the rights of men, that we may 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



163 



have access to the nations, that we 
may lay before them the saving 
principles of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and thus discharge the high 
commission that has been placed 
upon us. 

This gospel is broad enough, and 
deep enough, and of such towering 
heights as to surpass the powers of 
the greatest mind to comprehend, 
and yet so simple in its funda- 
mentals as to satisfy the honest in- 
quiry of the child. We speak of 
faith, repentance, baptism, and the 
laying on of hands, as the first 
principles and ordinances of the 
gospel. We have gone so far as 
to number them — the first, the sec- 
ond, the third and fourth princi- 
ples, and the first and the second 
ordinances. Are there others? Ver- 
ily, verily, yes. What, a fifth? Yes, 
and a sixth, and a seventh, aye, and 
a tenth, and a hundredth and a 
thousandth. There is no end to 
the principles of truth embodied 
in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
yet each one is dependent upon the 
fundamentals, and each one grows 
out of those that have been given 
before. 

May the Lord open our minds 
and expand our souls, and give us 
the desire to live up to what we 
have, that we may receive the 
more ; for "We believe all that God 
has revealed, all that He does now 
reveal, and we believe that He will 
yet reveal many great and import- 
ant things pertaining to the king- 
dom of God." Be we ready, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

We approach the close of a great 
conference. We have come up to 
be fed, and we have received the 
bread of life. I can scarcely hope, 
my brethren and sisters, to be able 
to add anything of profit to the 
splendid instruction and admonition 
and counsel that have come to us 
during the sessions of this confer- 
ence. I feel certain that I could 
not give to you any principles of 
the gospel which have not received 
some attention. With the help of 
our Father's Spirit, however, I 
should be pleased if I could make 
some application of the great truths 
of the gospel as they have been 
presented to us. 

During the past year I have had 
the high privilege of going about 
among the people, participating 
with them in their meetings and en- 
joying with them some of the func- 
tions of the Church. I have had 
some little opportunity for observa- 
tion. My observation is that the 
people of God are trying more day 
by day to live according to his 
word and to keep his command- 
ments. The larger percentage in 
attendance at the conferences of 
the Church, as they are held in the 
various stakes, and in the wards of 
the Church, give rather striking 
evidence of an increased interest in 
the things that pertain to our Fath- 
er's kingdom. An increase of at- 
tention to the various duties which 
are imposed upon those who hold 
the priesthood and also upon those 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who work in the various organiza- 
tions of the Church, corroborates 
the notion that we have that the 
people are in very deed trying more 
and more to conform their lives to 
the pattern laid down by the Re- 
deemer of the world. These obser- 
vations bring much of encourage- 
ment and satisfaction to the gener- 
al authorities of the Church, as I 
am sure they bring encouragement 
to all of the people. 

We are able to observe, however, 
from time to time, some few con- 
ditions that seem to deserve a 
warning word and a little caution, 
and without being guilty of paint- 
ing a picture that might be consid- 
ered black or gloomy, I would call 
to the attention of the Latter-day 
Saints a few things which, I think, 
deserve their immediate considera- 
tion and which if treated properly 
may bring something of increased 
devotion on the part of a large 
number of the members of the 
Church. 

Perhaps because my work during 
the past ten or twelve years has 
been largely devoted to the young 
people and their interests, my heart 
goes out particularly to them. I 
never can forget them. I always 
see in the young the future of the 
Church, of the State and of the Na- 
tion. I always look to. the children 
as the hope of Israel. They draw 
out from me the best that is within 
me and the tenderest thoughts and 
the greatest desire to be of service, 
and as I see throughout some of 
the stakes of the Church conditions 
which, in my opinion, militate 
against their welfare, against their 
growth, against their accomplish- 
ment of the great purposes that the 
Father of us all has in store for 
them, I feel that it is my duty to 
call attention to some of these 



things in the hope that they may 
be rectified. 

Let me give you an example : 
Only a week or two ago I was in 
one of the stakes of the Church 
where a bishop reported to me that 
within the confines of his ward 
a resort given over to swimming 
and dancing, refreshments and oth- 
er forms of amusement, in attend- 
ance upon which there had been 
counted upon one Sabbath day 
more than four hundred automo- 
biles loaded with people, and par- 
ticularly young people; a resort 
where the children of the Latter- 
day Saints and the children of oth- 
er good people were enticed by the 
things that are made to appeal to 
them; a resort kept and promoted 
by a man who has at heart no pur- 
pose except to make money and 
who cares not a farthing for the 
morals and the welfare of young 
men and young women ; and by the 
way, that is not an uncommon thing 
in the amusements of this day. 
There was a time when the amuse- 
ments and the entertainment^ 
among our people were conducted 
for the benefit of the people them- 
eslves. Unfortunately, they have 
now in some measure, at least in 
too large a measure, become com- 
mercialized, so that the only thing 
to which attention is paid is the 
making of money, irrespective of 
the fact that disgrace and dishonor 
may be brought upon those who 
patronize such places. The exam- 
ple I cite to you is, I believe, an 
exceptional and an exaggerated 
case, but I know, as you know, that 
there are within the Church other 
places that tend to lead our young 
people away from their duty,' from 
the path of integrity, wholesome- 
ness, purity, morality that our fath- 
ers and our mothers have bidden 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



165 



them tread. So, my brethren and my 
sisters, I appeal to you to have 
care for your children and I ap- 
peal to the boys and the girls of 
this Church to live according to the 
plan of life that is laid down for 
them in this great and beautiful 
gospel of ours. 

If we can only bring our boys 
and girls to know and feel the 
depth and the height and the 
breadth of this great plan of life 
which is given to us by the Savior 
of the world, they will be safe. But, 
are we making them feel it? Are 
we giving them the same firm tes- 
timony of the truth that has come 
to us ? Are we implanting in their 
souls a keen desire to live the gos- 
pel as they ought to live it? We 
are not implanting in their hearts 
that desire when we permit them 
to partake of the amusements and 
the sins and the accompanying dan- 
gers that come to them from the 
world. When we let them think 
that it is more important for them 
to be in fashion and in style than 
it is for them to keep the command- 
ments of God we are giving them 
the opportunity of straying away 
and of becoming estranged from 
these great truths and from this 
great plan of life and salvation. And 
so I tell you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that there never was a time 
attendant with greater danger to 
the youth of Israel than the pres- 
ent time. There never was a time 
when there were more allurements 
for them to be led away from the 
truth. There never was a time 
when it was harder to make boys 
and girls believe and feel that the 
greatest thing in their lives is the 
gospel, than today. That is my ob- 
servation. It is my conviction. 
And it needs all- of our courage, 
all of our strength and considera- 



tion and attention to keep our boys 
and girls in the path of truth. 

I am not ashamed of the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. I am proud 
of it. Never was my heart so lifted 
up in just pride, I think, as it 
was in this great assembly yester- 
day when the President of our 
Church bore that striking testimony 
of truth that went into the soul of 
every man and every woman who 
heard him. I am proud to be iden- 
tified with this great work. I am 
proud to bear the name of Jesus 
Christ. God help me to be worthy 
of it. I want you, my brethren and 
sisters, to teach your boys and your 
girls to be proud of that name, 
prouder of it than all else in the 
world that may come to them. It 
is their salvation. They may hanker 
after the things of this world, they 
may spend their lives in trying to 
attain the comforts and the luxuries 
and the riches of this life, but I 
tell you, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, they will die in spirit if they 
do not have the gospel of Jesus 
Christ in their hearts, and all their 
lives will have been spent in vain, 
and all their possessions will be as 
naught and their whole lives will 
be one great regret and one great 
sorrow to them. 

Therefore, let us give to these 
boys and girls of ours the testi- 
monies of the truth that we have. 
Let us be careful of them. As 
President Lund said in his address, 
let us have confidence in them, but 
let us not abuse that confidence. 
Boys and girls need care. They 
have not arrived at the age of ma- 
turity that enables them always to 
act wisely for themselves. They 
need direction, they need super- 
vision, particularly in their play. 
They can not always be trusted to 
do the thing that is best for them 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



when they are on their own respon- 
sibility. 

If I may without giving offense, 
I should like to suggest to some of 
you fathers and mothers that you 
be careful about giving to your 
boys and girls the unrestricted, un- 
supervised use of your automobiles 
and your conveyances. Time after 
time, as I have traveled over our 
roads in the night time have I seen 
automobiles loaded down with boys 
and girls in positions that' would 
have shamed their parents and that 
will some day be a shame to them, 
I tell you we need to be careful. 
We need to have charge and con- 
cern of these precious souls given 
into our care and our keeping, and 
that need is only emphasized by 
modern times. Thousands and 
thousands of the boys have been 
called away from the farms. The 
farmers will be obliged to hire 
trnsient help. Hundreds of men will 
come to our homes in order to do 
the work that has to be done. We 
shall welcome their aid, but we will 
beware of their influence. Let me 
caution you, let me caution you 
never to permit your boys and your 
girls, if you can help it, to asso- 
ciate with men and women whose 
influence you are not sure is good. 

And I want to say to my breth- 
ren, my younger brethren, those 
young men who are now just ap- 
proaching the prime of life, that it 
is incumbent upon them that they 
learn to appreciate the priesthood 
of God. Thousands of them have 
had this holy priesthood given to 
them. Some think that it is cheap 
because it comes to so many. I 
tell you it is the most precious thing 
in this world, and if you will only 
come to appreciate it and know its 
full meaning, you will agree that it 



exceeds in value all else that has 
ever been given to you, and it will 
be of greater strength and greater 
joy and greater satisfaction to you 
than anything else. Boys appreci- 
ate the priesthood of God. It is an 
honor to be a deacon. It is a high 
honor to be a priest and to serve 
in the various functions which are 
given to that order in the priest- 
hood. It is a great and mighty 
and ennobling honor to receive the 
holy Melchizedek priesthood and be 
ordained an elder. Never do one 
thing in your lives that will degrade 
you in that priesthood. I believe 
that no one can receive that priest- 
hood and fail to honor it, without 
being held accountable in the sight 
of our Father. Indeed I sometimes 
think it would be better if some who 
have lightly thrown aside this great 
high privilege and honor and op- 
portunity and authority that has 
come to them if they had never re- 
ceived it. Their condemnation, I 
fear, will be all the more severe. 

We are talking a lot now about 
liberty bonds and we are talking a 
great deal about conservation of 
food, and saving wheat, and saving 
all the products of the land, and it 
is well that we should. We be- 
lieve in it. We know it is neces- 
sary, but I want to say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that there is 
nothing in this wide world that we 
need to conserve quite so much as 
the manhood and the womanhood 
of the nation. Talk about the value 
of wheat, talk about the value of 
war munitions, they don't compare 
with the men, and the women, too, 
who go to make up the state and 
the nation. You can not have a 
great nation without great men and 
women, and while it is not possible 
for every one of the citizens of a 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



' 167 



great nation to achieve high places 
of distinction, this I always remem- 
ber, as was once said on this sub- 
ject by a great writer, that while 
we may not all be Washingtons, 
we can all be such men and 
such women as will uphold and 
sustain a Washington in the 
path of duty and the way of 
glory. We can all teach our sons 
and daughters the fundamental 
principles that underlie true citi- 
zenship, true honor, true loyalty, 
and let me tell you that the place 
to teach loyalty, as we sometimes 
say about charity, begins at home. 
The place to teach all boys and 
girls the value of citizenship and 
the value of being loyal and honor- 
able in their duties and obligations 
to state and country is at home by 
teaching them to receive and honor 
and obey the people who are placed 
to preside over them. Never say 
a word that would detract from 
the influence of the bishop or of the 
president of the stake or of any of 
the elders of the people, and I 
promise you your boys and your 
girls will be good citizens of the 
land. 

God help us, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to be true to our obligations. 
Help us to be true to the high name 
that we bear. God bless us that 
we may indeed be the Church of 
Christ, that we may have his Spirit 
to go out from our midst among 
our fellows in the land to convince 
them of the greatness and the ef- 
ficacy of the work in which we are 
engaged. And help us to so live 
that the sermon of our lives may 
preach the word of God to the 
whole wide world, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

the love and friendship in some de- 
gree the Latter-day Saints had for 
his father, the late President 
Francis M. Lyman. 

It is new and strange for me to 
occupy this place. I wish President 
Smith, in his eloquent and forceful 
way, had spoken during the few 
minutes left for me, and had given 
me six months in which to prepare 
a few remarks. 

While in Tooele recently I visited 
the same church building and saw 
the same seat in which I sat as a 
child many years ago and listened 
to the powerful and eloquent words 
of President Joseph F. Smith. Such 
was the impression he made that I 
remember what he said then as 
clearly as I remember what I have 
heard him say at this conference. 
From that time in my childhood to 
this hour I have heard no public ut- 
terance of his that was not thril- 
lingly eloquent. Can you wonder 
then that, being new in this po- 
sition, I wanted him to speak in my 
place ? 

Who am I ? Why should I be here ? 
My life, my work, my attention 
have been .directed almost ex- 
clusively to educational work. I 
have not done service as a regular 
missionary. I do not stand before 
you, therefore, as a preacher, but 
merely as a "Mormon" boy and all 
I can do is say a few blunt words 
in defense of my religion and my 
people, as I have done during my

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



college life and at other times when 
separated from you — my people. 

I, too, am pleased to bear test- 
imony to the truth and .divinity of 
the remarks that have been made at 
this conference. The words of 
Brother Stephen L. Richards con- 
cerning the welfare of our sons and 
daughters — our most precious re- 
source — made a marked impression 
on my mind. Seven years of my 
life have been spent in eastern col- 
leges and during that time, .sep- 
arated as I was from my kindred 
and from the Church, I had nearly 
all the temptations to resist. The 
teachings of the Church and the 
training of my good "Mormon" 
mother gave me strength. I prayed 
as she taught me to pray, I believed 
in God and in his guidance, I began 
every day's labor with an earnest 
prayer for help, I closed each day 
with an expression of gratitude to 
my Heavenly Father for his guid- 
ance. Thus was I able, when sur- 
round with temptation, to make my 
life, conform with the teachings of 
the Church and to live in accor- 
dance with the wishes of my excel- 
lent parents. 

Prayer, as I see it, is the strong- 
est factor for good that can come 
into the life of a boy. Unfortunate 
the youth who has to face the 
temptations of the world if in his 
childhood he has not learned to 
pray. If your soldier son learned 
this childhood lesson at your knee, 
rest assured his faith in God will 
keep him clean. If he returns he'll 
do so in the strength and 
majesty and power of his clean 
manhood. If he gives his life to the 
glorious cause of human liberty he, 
by so doing, adds undying luster to 
your family name. 

I have never been sufficiently 



conceited to think that I deserve to 
stand in this sacred place that was 
occupied so recently by my distin- 
guished father. His heart is aglow 
with delight, if he knows with what 
intensity many of you have ex- 
pressed your congratulations to me 
for his sake. My fondest hope is 
that as a member of the Council of 
the Twelve I may merit in some de- 
gree the precious love and friend- 
ship you had for him. 

May our heavenly Father make 
us better and happier from day to 
day, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I do not purpose to detain you 
long, but my mind has been partic- 
ularly awakened on one or two sub- 
jects which I would like to call to 
the attention of this vast assembly 
of Latter-day Saints. 

THE CRIME OF ADULTERY AND UN- 
CHASTITY 

I wish to announce to you and 
call to your attention the fact that 
the next to the greatest sin and 
crime that can be committed, and 
for which the penalty in the law 
of God is just the same, is the crime 
of adultery and unchastity. Some- 
times we hear rumors and reports 
from various parts of our country 
that are heart-rending and awful 
if they are true, and that is in re- 
gard to the lightness in which the 
principles of chastity are held by 
some of our young people, and in 
some respects are lightly passed 
over by those who ought to be 
teachers in regard to these princi- 
ples, and who ought to instil into 
the hearts of the youth the princi- 
ples of virtue and of chastity. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 



169 



The Lord Almighty affixed in the 
law of .Moses the penalty of death 
for the crime of murder or the 
shedding of blood, and the Lord 
Almighty affixed the same penalty 
of death upon the crime of adultery 
and unchastity. I hope that the 
Latter-day Saints will hold in mind 
the fact that there is no greater 
crime that men and women can 
commit, except the crime of mur- 
der itself, than that of adultery and 
unchastity; and let this be a pre- 
cept to be taught and instilled into 
the minds of our children, and to 
our children's children henceforth, 
with all earnestness and fidelity on 
the part of those who are called to 
be watchmen upon the towers of 
Zion. 

WHAT IS LIBERTY? 

We have been talking, and we 
do talk very much, about this won- 
derful, this glorious, this most 
choice principle of liberty, for 
which we are willing to sacrifice all 
that we possess in a worldly sense, 
and that we are also willing to add 
in that sacrifice our own lives to 
defend it. What is it? What is 
this liberty for which we are will- 
ing to fight, for which we are will- 
ing to sacrifice life and all that we 
possess in the world? Let me tell 
you. It is simply the liberty of 
all mankind to worship God in 
righteousness ; that is what it is ; 
for all mankind to have the liberty 
to do right, the liberty to do good, 
the liberty to pursue happiness, in 
honor, in virtue and in uprightness. 
But it cannot for one moment de- 
scend in any degree to license or 
to infringement upon the rights of 
others. No man has any liberty 
to impose upon his brother, to rob 
or to steal, to lie or to bear false 
witness, or to injure or wrong his 



fellowmen. When we are talking 
of this great and glorious principle 
of liberty it is that we may be free 
to worship God and to love him 
with all our hearts and minds and 
strength, and to love our neighbor 
as ourselves, and to protect the 
principles of virtue and honor 
throughout all the world. That is 
the liberty that we are looking for 
and that we are willing to fight for. 

We are not trying to defend the 
liberty of mankind to be drunken, 
to be debauchees, to advocate crime, 
to interfere with the rights of oth- 
ers. This is not liberty. The law 
of nations, as well as the law of 
God, prohibits it, and it cannot ex- 
ist except it exist contrary to the 
laws of righteousness and contrary 
to the principles of liberty that we 
are willing to fight for and that we 
are striving for. 

GOD NEITHER DESIGNS NOR IS THE 
CAUSE OF WICKEDNESS AND CRIME 

I do not want this congregation, 
or any of the congregations of the 
Latter-day Saints, to conceive the 
idea, or to entertain it for one mo- 
ment, that the true and living God 
— the Father of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ — who so loved 
the world that he sent his Only Be- 
gotten Son into the world, to bleed, 
to die, and to be sacrificed for the 
sin of the world, the Father of our 
spirits, he who loves his children, 
is in any degree responsible for the 
carnage, the bloodshed, the crime 
and the infamy that is today being 
perpetrated because of war, or any 
other cause, throughout the world. 
God is not responsible for it. I 
want you to let this sink into your 
hearts and remember it. God does 
not design wickedness or crime in 
the midst of his children, neither is 
he the cause of it. One of the apos- 



170 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ties said : "Let no man say when he 
is tempted, I am tempted of God : 
for God cannot be tempted with 
evil ; neither tempteth he any man. 
But every man is tempted, when he 
is drawn away of his own lust, and 
enticed." The Lord God Almighty 
has no pleasure whatever in the 
nations of the earth contending one 
with another and destroying them- 
selves. All this is contrary to the 
will of God, contrary to his pur- 
poses, and contrary to his love, 
and to the very nature of the 
true and the living God. He 
loveth his children ; he desires 
them to have life everlast- 
ing and nOt death. I pity the 
expressions that I have heard so 
many times in the public print from 
ignorant preachers and some poor 
mothers whose sons have been sac- 
rificed at the front : " Why does 
God permit it? Why has God per- 
mitted my son to be slain ? Why 
does God permit the war that is ex- 
isting today in all the nations of the 
earth?" The answer is: Because 
the nations of the earth, together 
with their leaders, exercise their 
freedom, the freedom of their 
agency, to pursue their wicked 
course, which results in war 
and in the death and destruction 
that is being perpetrated today 
throughout the nations of the earth. 
The Lord has no pleasure in it, 
and I do not want the Latter-day 
Saints to conceive the idea that 
God is responsible, or to charge 
him with the crime of desiring the 
destruction of his children. It is 
not true ! 

GOD LOVES AND IS THE AUTHOR OF 
RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE 

I just wanted to say those 
few words to the Latter-day Saints. 
The Lord loveth peace. The doc- 



trine of the Savior of men was 
"Peace on earth, good will to men," 
love, love unfeigned. The great- 
est of all the commandments that 
was ever given to the children of 
men is : "Thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart, and with 
all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 
This is the first and great command- 
ment. And the second is like unto 
it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. On these two command- 
ments hang all the law and the 
prophets." If in the central nations 
of the earth this spirit of love had 
existed, this principle of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ ; if this glorious ad- 
monition had been taken to heart 
by the rulers of those nations, there 
never would have been any war, 
there never would have been any 
bloodshed, there never would have 
been the devastation and ruin and 
evil conditions that exist today. It 
is because the people of the world 
have not the gospel. It is because 
they do not obey the truth. It is 
because they have not Christ, and 
therefore they are left to them- 
selves, and the results that we see 
are the consequences of their own 
misbehavior and of their own wick- 
ed deeds. 

CLOSING ADMONITIONS 

I thank you, my brethren and 
sisters, for your attendance at this 
conference. You have shown your 
integrity, your love for the work 
in which you are engaged, your re- 
spect for this great occasion of 
meeting together on the 6th of 
April, in commemoration of the day 
on which the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was organ- 
ized. We want you to continue to 
entertain this faith, this confidence, 
this love, this deep interest in the 
work in which you are engaged, 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 



171 



that at every recurrence of this oc- 
casion, and of the semi-annual con- 
ference of the Church, you may be 
punctual in attendance at the con- 
ferences and show your willing- 
ness to uphold and to sustain the 
work throughout all the country 
where you dwell. 

I feel to extend my gratitude 
and my thanks to my brethren who 
have spoken the words of truth and 
of righteousness, and who have 
given exhortation that an angel 
from the presence of God could not 
have given more clearly, more in- 
tently and fervently from the heart 
than our brethren have given it to 
you during our conference. Let us 
prize their words, their admoni- 
tions; let us hearken to their cau- 
tions, to their warnings, and to 
their exhortations to us to observe 
the principles of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and live like Latter-day 
Saints — more especially like Lat- 
ter-day Saints than like some "Mor- 
mons" live. I want to say to my 
dear Brother Richard, when he 
speaks of that mother of his and 
calls her a "Mormon" mother, he 
means well, but really she was a 
Latter-day Saint. I knew her. 
( Laughter. ) 

I also desire to express my pleas- 
ure and gratitude and ' thanks to 
those who have made music for us, 
our soloists, our singers of duets, 
the choir, and the leaders of our 
music. We thank them for their 



efforts, and we rejoice and enjoy 
exceedingly their harmony, for it 
is a part of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the true spirit of wor- 
ship. We will now sing, "TfojC 
Spirit of God like a fire is burning," 
and this semi-annual conference of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints will be adjourned 
for six months. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"The Spirit of God like a fire is 
burning." 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Joseph C. Bentley, Presi- 
dent of the Juarez stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months. 



Prof. Anthony C. Lund conduct- 
ed the singing in the Tabernacle. 
Prof. John J. McClellan played the 
accompaniments, interludes, etc., on 
the great organ, assisted by Edward 
P. Kimball, and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the 
discourses were taken in the Taber- 
nacle by Elder Franklin W. Otter- 
strom, assisted by Clarence Cramer ; 
and in the Asembly Hall and by the 
Bureau of Information, by Elders 
Frederick E. Barker, and Fred G. 
Barker.

Clerk of Conference.

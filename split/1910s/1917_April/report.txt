2 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

INTRODUCTION. 

I am very happy in the privilege that I enjoy of meeting with you 
in the opening session of the 87th Annual General Conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I can assure you we feel 
highly honored, as every one present associated with the Church must 
feel, in witnessing the great multitude who have assembled here this morn- 
ing in honor of the opening of this conference. I fear that it will be 
somewhat difficult for me, to get my voice in trim sufficient to make 
myself heard and understood. It is no small task to attempt to address 
an audience like this, depending, as I do, upon the promptings of the 
spirit that may pervade our conference in regard to what I shall say. 
I have certainly obeyed in this respect, the injunction of the Savior, -as 
recorded in the scriptures (Matthew 10:19, 20): "Take no thought 
how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour 
what ye shall speak." The Spirit will give the impressions that are needed 
as far as the time will permit and as far as we are susceptible to the 
impressions of the Spirit of God, I sincerely do hope that the Spirit of 
the Lord will pervade this assembly and have place in our minds and 
hearts, that we may rejoice in the privilege that we have of meeting 
together under so favorable circumstances, witnessing, as we do in our 
assembling here, the many blessings and privileges the Lord has vouch- 
safed unto us. 

EXERCISE PRUDENCE, ECONOMY AND EXTREME INDUSTRY. 

We are living in critical times. Conditions are such as practically 
defy either .description or complete understanding, for we can see today 
only what is visible to us, but no one unless inspired can foretell today 
what may occur tomorrow. But we need not be concerned anxiously 
about this, for the duty of members of the Church, as such, and their 
duty as men and women in the communities in which they live, and as 
citizens of our country, are of the greatest importance to us for present 
consideration. Our duty is to seek for peace and happiness and the well 
being of the whole human family, as far as it lies in our power to exert 
an influence to this end; and if we do our .duty today, as members of 
the Church and as citizens of our state and of the adjoining states in 
which we live, we need not greatly fear what tomorrow may bring forth. 
One of the things that impresses me as a matter of importance to be con- 
sidered by the people of our state and of this intermountain region is a 
careful course of prudence, economy, and extreme industry and careful- 
ness with reference to the production and conservation of the necessaries 
of life. We have had a long winter which has extended down far into 
the lap of spring. It 'is possible that we may have a short season for 
growth of grain and cereals of all kinds, together with vegetables and 
fruits, that are needful to sustain life. We should realize that we are 
dependent upon the soil and upon tilling it, the labor of the husbandman 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 3 

and the blessing of Almighty God upon our labors and upon the soil, 
for the necessaries of life. We cannot subsist without these things. 

I think that the united faith and prayer of the people who believe 
in the possibility of the answer to the prayers of those who are devout and 
who have faith in God, should be lifted to the Giver of all Good, that 
peace may continue to prevail over all our land, and that prosperity might 
attend the people of our great country ; that peace may also be restored 
to all the nations of the earth, when it shall be the purpose and the will of 
God'that it should be. I think it is our duty to ask the blessing of the 
Lord upon the labor of the husbandman. That the blessings of the sea- 
son's fruitfulness may be bestowed upon those who till the soil and who 
earn the bread and food necessary to sustain life. In years gone by, 
even before our state was a territory, the earliest settlers of this country 
were, by the merciful providences of the Lord, and the wise counsel of 
the leaders of the people, in a position to help their neighbors with the 
necessaries of life. While many of them in the south, the north, and in 
the western part of our country, were searching for gold and precious 
metals, things that would not in themselves sustain life, we were cultivat- 
ing the soil, producing that which was needful for them, and they poured 
their gold into our laps for the 'food thatlwe gave them in return, to sustain 
their lives and to enable them to prosecute their labors. I hope the people 
of this state, especially the Latter-day Saints, will prove themselves to 
be veritable Josephs in Egypt, that when necessity stalks abroad through 
the land, the needy may apply to us for that which is necessary for their 
happiness and for their subsistence. I understand that the authorities at 
Washington have requested those in charge of our Agricultural College, 
in the north, to exercise all the influence they can to prevail upon the 
people of this state to economize and to produce, save, and store up, to 
the best of their ability, those things that will supply, if need be, even 
the sinews of war, if war should come. 

THE SPIRIT WHICH LATTER-DAY SAINTS SHOULD MANIFEST IN WAR. 

Speaking of the possibility of conflict, of war, I exhort my friends, 
the people of our country, especially in this intermountain region, to 
maintain above all other things the spirit of humanity, of love, and of 
peace-making, that even though they may be called into action they will 
not demolish, override and destroy the principles which we believe in, 
which we have tried to inculcate, and which we are exhorted to main- 
tain ; peace and good will toward all mankind, though we may be brought 
into action with the enemy. I want to say to the Latter-day Saints who 
may enlist, and whose services the country may require, that when they 
become soldiers of the State and of the Nation that they will not forget 
that they are also soldiers of the Cross, that they are minisers of life and 
not of death; and when they go forth, they may go forth in the spirit 
of defending the liberties of mankind rather than for the purpose 
of destroying the enemy. If we could convert them to peaceful ways and 
to the love of peace without destroying them, we would become saviors 
of men. And it is abominable that men who engage in the great and 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

grand and necessary duty of protecting and guarding our Nation from 
the -encroachments of wicked enemies, cruel and destructive foes, should 
not maintain among themselves lives of honor, virtue, purity and of im- 
munity from sin and crime of every kind. It is a disgraceful thought 
that a man to become a soldier should become a rake and abandon him- 
self to crime and wickedness. Let the soldiers that go out from Utah 
be and remain men of honor. And when they are called obey the call, 
and manfully meet the duty, the dangers, or the labor, that may be re- 
quired of them, or that they may be set to do; but do it with an eye 
single to the accomplishment of the good that is aimed to be accomplished, 
and not with the blood-thirsty desire to kill and to destroy. 

OUR MISSION IS TO HELP THE OPPRESSED AND NEEDY. 

Charity, or love, is the greatest principle in existence. If we can lend 
a helping hand to the oppressed, if we can aid those who are despondent 
and in sorrow, if we can uplift and ameliorate the condition of mankind, 
it is our misssion to do it, it is an essential part of our religion to do it. 
And I say to our friends present that we have an organization in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that is perfect in its opera- 
tion, by which we may call today to almost the whole Church, for aid, and 
tomorrow we will receive returns with the generous contributions that are 
freely given for a good cause, and it will cost nobody a cent. Every 
dime contributed for the benefit of the poor goes to the poor, and is not 
consumed by charitable organizations, who collect and handle means in- 
tended for the poor, and are paid for their services, thus absorbing a 
large percentage of the means contributed for the benefit of the poor, 
by those who are not poor. I wish to announce that to our friends. The 
Latter-day Saints know this, they understand it. They have recollection 
of recent events in which, within twenty-four hours or thereabouts, the 
people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints contributed 
somewhere near $35,000, and it was sent to the afflicted people of the 
east that were suffering in consequence of war, and it was put into hands 
who would distribute it wisely to those who needed, without cost to any- 
body ; and a portion of that fund, which was not distributed, remains to be 
dealt out to those who are really in need as their circumstances require. 

A SPIRIT OF LOVE AND TOLERATION ENJOINED. 

I should not occupy too much of your time, but I have another 
thought or two that I wish to announce, merely as a matter of reference 
or as a text, perhaps, for those who may follow, if the Spirit so*leads, to 
amplify. We admonish, we beseech our brothers and sisters in the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, not only to honor themselves by a proper course of 
Hving, but also to honor and love and be charitable to your neighbors, 
every one of you. We admonish you not only to keep the greatest of 
all the commandments that has ever been given of God to man, to love 
the Lord your God, with all your heart and mind and strength, but we 
exhort you also to observe that second law, next unto it, to love your 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 5 

neighbors as yourselves ; return good for evil, do not revile others be- 
cause you are or may be reviled. We have no need to tear down the 
houses of other people (using this expression as a symbol). We are 
perfectly willing that they should live in the homes they have erected for 
themselves, and,we will try to show them a better way. While we will not 
condemn that which they love and cherish above all other things in 
the world, we will endeavor to show them a better way and build them a 
better house and then invite them kindly, in the spirit of Christ, of true 
Christianity, to enter the better dwelling. That is the principle, and I 
wish to impress it, upon you this morning. I desire to impress, if I can, 
upon the minds of the parents the necessity of properly instructing and 
teaching their clrldren with reference to this glorious principle, charity 
and love, that love for our neighbor that will enable us to cherish his 
rights as sacredly as we cherish our own, to defend the rights and the 
liberties of our neighbor, as we would defend our own rights and liber- 
ties, put up the fallen bars in the fences of our neighbors that are care- 
lessly left down, just as we would put our own bars up surrounding our 
own fields, in order to protect our crops from the ravages of stray ani- 
mals. That is a simple thing to say, but there is a meaning in it, and it 
is a very important thing for us to observe. Many of us are farmers. I 
have heard of some people who were so far from a love for this principle 
of kindness that they would prefer to tear down the fence and let down 
the bars of their neighbors in order that they might receive damage, 
rather than to put up the bars and try to protect them as they would wish 
to be protected themselves. 

PARENTS SHOULD TEACH THEIR CHILDREN BELIEF IN CHRIST, AND LOYALTY 

TO LAW AND COUNTRY. 

Fathers and mothers in Israel, will you try to teach your children that 
there is no other name given under heaven by which we have such a 
glorious hope of the resurrection from death to life, or assurance in the 
principle and promise of eternal exaltation i,n the Kingdomof God than that 
of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. We are a Christian people, we believe in 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and we feel that it is our duty to acknowledge him 
as our Savior and Redeemer. Teach it to your children. Teach them that 
the Prophet Joseph Smith restored again to the earth the priesthood that 
was held by Peter and James and John, who were ordained under the 
hands of the Savior himself. Teach them that Joseph Smith, the prophet, 
when only a boy, was chosen and called of God to lay the foundations of 
the Church of Christ in the world, to restore the holy priesthood, and 
the ordinances of the gospel which are necessary to qualify men to enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. Teach your children to respect their neigh- 
bors. Teach your ch'ldren to respect their bishops and the teachers that 
come to their homes to teach them. Teach your children to respect old 
age, gray hairs, and feeble frames. Teach them to venerate and 
to hold in honorable remembrance their parents and help all those 
who are helpless and needy. Teach your children, as you have 
been taught yourselves, to honor the priesthood which you hold, 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the priesthood which we hold as elders in Israel. Teach your children to 
honor themselves, teach your children to honor the principle of presidency 
by which organizations are held intact and by which strength and power 
for the well being and happiness and upbuilding of the people is pre- 
served. Teach your children that when they go to school they should 
honor their teachers in that which is true and honest, in that which 
is manly and womanly and is worth while ; and also teach them to avoid 
the bad examples of their teachers out of school and the bad principles 
of men and women who are sometimes teachers in schools. Teach your 
children to honor the law of God and the law of the state and the law 
of our country. Teach them to respect and hold in honor those who are 
chosen by the people to stand at their head and execute justice and ad- 
minister the law. Teach them to be loyal to their country, loyal to right- 
eousness and uprightness and honor, and thereby they will grow up to 
be men and women choice above all the men and women of the world. 

REMEMBER THE BLESSINGS OF TEMPLE ORDINANCES. 

And as Latter-day Saints, as members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
do not forget those ordinances of the gospel which require proper recog- 
nition in order that we may be placed unexceptionably before the Lord. 
The Lord has revealed to us a principle by which, by the proper and 
righteous exercise of divine authority, we may be joined together for time 
and all eternity. Teach your children that principle, that they may live 
worthy to go and receive the benefits and blessings of these ordinances. 
. Teach your children and let yourselves be taught the fact that it is neces- 
sary for you to become saviors upon Mount Zion for those who have 
died without the knowledge of the gospel, and that the temples of God 
in these mountains, and that are being reared in other lands, have been 
built and are designed expressly for the performance of these sacred 
ordinances which are necessary for those who have passed away without 
them. Do not forget these things. Keep them in mind for they are 
necessasry for us. 

A TESTIMONY TO THE PURITY, HONOR, AND INTEGRITY OF LEADERS OF THE 

CHURCH. 

There are many things that might be said, but I do not want to 
weary you. I want to bear my testimony. I have served from my youth 
up along with such men as Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Willard 
Richards, George A. Smith, Jedediah M. Grant, Daniel H. Wells, John 
Taylor, George Q. Cannon, and Wilford Woodruff and his associates, 
and Lorenzo Snow and his associates, the members of the twelve apostles, 
the seventies and the high priests in the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, for more than sixty years ; and, that my word may be 
heard by every stranger within the sound of my voice, I want to testify to 
you that better men than these have never lived, within the range of my 
acquaintance. I can so testify because I was familiar with these men, 
grew up from babyhood with them, associated with them in council, in 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 7 

prayer and supplication, and in travel from settlement to settlement 
through our country here, and in crossing the plains. I have heard them 
in private and in public, and I bear my testimony to you that they were 
men of, God, true men, pure men, God's noble men. Virtuous men, 
who never were either tempted to .do evil or tempted others to do wrong, 
men whose examples and whose lives were above reproach, except in 
what corrupt, wicked or ignorant men supposed they saw and presumed 
to denounce as wrong in them. It was a crime in the eyes of lecherous 
scoundrels that President Young should have more wives than one. But 
they were his wives, and he honored them, and their children, and fed, 
clothed and educated them. He did not desert, nor abuse, nor abandon 
them; and because of this, extremely pious people and others have con- 
demned him. Some of the rest of us have come under similar condem- 
nation. I know that this was a true principle with them and that they 
did not sin, because they did not do violence to anybody; neither did they 
wrong anybody ; but that is a thing of the past. Others have complained 
and do complain, because certain men, who were fortunate enough to 
have families when the people of the state capitulated with the govern- 
ment of the United States, and President Woodruff announced the dis- 
continuance of plural marriages, have taken care of their wives and 
their children that were left with them. I want to tell you just once 
more, and would tell it before all the world if I could, that I believe with 
all my heart, that if any man ought to be damned in this world, it is the 
man that will abandon, the mother of his children. We do not do it, 
we will not do it, the Lord Almighty helping us not to do it. Now, pardon 
me for digressing so far from the thought that was first in my mind. 

I bear my testimony to these men, that they were good men, pure 
men, honest men, leaders, builders, teachers of righteousness by precept 
and by example. They live in my memory as sacred as my life. 

I bear my testimony to you that no man has ever yet been able, so 
far as it is recorded in history, to bring to pass an organization like 
that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as it was organ- 
ized by Joseph Smith, the boy prophet. I testify that Joseph Smith re- 
vealed anew, and so to speak, re-enacted the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
nothing else, even including the injunction of the Master, "if ye were 
Abraham's seed, ye would do the works of Abraham." 

GOD THE FATHER AND JESUS CHRIST HIS SON. 

I accept Jesus of Nazareth as the only begotten Son of God in the 
flesh. This is a great principle, though it seems hard for some people 
to understand it — those who believe in the foolish notion that God is a 
"vapor," if )?ou please, ether, electricity, "energy" or anything else you 
might call him or it, and that he fills the immensity of space, is every- 
where present at the same time, etc., etc. It is difficult indeed for those 
who believe this foolish doctrine to believe that Christ could be the Son 
of God ; that God, be : ng only spirit, or "energy," as defined by a certain 
learned preacher, could beget a son in "his own likeness," and "image," 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

and the Son also be in the likeness and image of mortal man. The apos- 
tles of Jesus Christ, his witnesses, declared it, and he himself has declared 
it by his own voice in the day in which we live, but it is hard to get peo- 
ple to understand how that nondecsript creation of man's ignorance called 
"God" by the sectarian world, which fills the immensity of space and is 
everywhere present at the same time, can beget a Son in the form of him- 
self and at the same time in the form of man. But when they hear the 
truth, as it was revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, by Christ 
himself, and as it is revealed in the testimony of the ancient scriptures, 
that God "created man in his own likeness, in his own image, male and 
female created he them," it is hard to get men to understand that Almighty 
God, who possesses all knowledge, all wisdom, and all power, can extend 
his power, his Spirit, his majesty and glory and .dominion over all his 
creations, while he himself sits upon his throne — it is hard to make them 
understand it, and yet that is the truth. We want to teach those prin- 
ciples to our children, and inculcate the teaching of the same things to 
our children's children to the latest generation, that they may grow up 
in the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, whom he has sent unto the 
world, whom to know is life eternal. 

THE NEW CHURCH OFFICE BUILDTNG. 

I will give way to my brethren to speak as the Spirit may impress 
them ; but, before I conclude. I have had jotted down a few statements of 
facts which I presume will be interesting, at least to those present at 
this conference. 

As you know, for the last sixty odd years, the Church has had 
its headquarters in the little old buildings,which were erected by President 
Brigham Young, away back in the early 50's, and which at the time served 
the purpose very well, and have continued to .do so until now. Still, they 
have become worn with age and not quite in keeping with the progress 
of other things. A couple of years ago we determined to construct a 
building which would afford office room for our various organizations. 
Previously, however, a very creditable building had been erected for the 
Presiding Bishopric, and for the Relief Societies and other organizations 
of the Church. But we concluded that we would build a house that 
would furnish suitable accommodations for the Presidency and others, 
and at the same time would be a monument of the real character of 
the work in which we are engaged. I am happy to say that we have prac- 
tically completed it, although we have been delayed on account of the lack 
of facility on the part of some of those who have contracted to furnish 
material with which to complete the adornment of the walls. We are 
waiting for marble. I am pleased to say that we have used, in the adorn- 
ment of the interior walls of our building, as far as it was possible, home 
materials— marble and onyx and precious stones that exist in great abund- 
ance in Utah, and it is therefore practically a home-made building. There 
has been expended for the erection and equipment of the new Church 
Office Building, $864,562. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



TEMPLES AND OTHER CHURCH BUILDINGS. 

There has been expended, up to date, on the erection of the new 
temple at Cardston, Alberta, Canada, $209,668., and it is still in process 
of erection. 

There has been expended in the erection of the temple in the Ha- 
waiian Islands, and which will be completed during the current year, 
$50,520. 

There has been paid out of the tithes during- the year 1916 for the 
support of the missions, $213,610. In addition to this, property has been 
purchased in Brooklyn, New York, and a mission house erected thereon, 
which has cost the Church $51,802. 

The Church has purchased mission property in the South African 
Mission during the year which has cost $9,333. 

The Church has purchased, also, additional real estate adjoining our 
mission property at Independence, Missouri, at a cost of $5,000. 

We have paid for a new chapel in St. Louis, Missouri, $6,400. 

In the year 1915, the Thomas D. Dee Memorial Hospital, of Ogden, 
was transferred to the Church, and since that time there as been ex- 
pended for its maintenance and erection of a beautiful nurses' home, 
$33,587. 

During the year 1916 the Church has contributed toward the erection 
of ward and stake meeting houses $177,736. 

OTHER EXPENDITURES. 

We have not been unmindful of the poor, not only in the stakes of 
Zion, but in the missions. There has been expended for charity through 
the different Church activities, for the year 1916, $308,951. 

We have continued to maintain the Church schools, and there has 
been paid out for this purpose, during 1916, $365,832. 

No doubt the Church Auditing Committee will give you other items, 
and more in detail, of the expenditures which have all been made for 
the benefit of the Church. 

MISCELLANEOUS STATISTICAL AND OTHER INFORMATION. 

There has been the usual increase in the membership of the Church. 
Information concerning the increase in the missions is incomplete, this 
year, in consequence of the Great War. 

At the close of the year 1916 there were 819 wards and 73 organized 
stakes of Zion, and there were 21 missions There were in the mission 
field, one patriarch, 61 high priests, 209 seventies, 876 elders, and 188 lady 
missionaries, making a total of 1,335 missionaries in the field. 

There has been a very marked improvement in ward teaching, both 
in the quality of the teaching and in the regularity of the visits to the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints by the teachers. Some of the stakes of 
Zion have had every family visited every month of the year, and in two 
or three stakes of Zion, every family has been visited every month for 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

several years past. This regular work of the ward teachers is having 
its effect in improved attendance at sacrament meetings, priesthood meet- 
ings, and other ward and stake activities. As you know, my brethren 
and sisters, the main object of this work, the visiting 6f the teachers 
to the homes and the families of the Church, is to ascertain whether there 
is any need there, whether any are sick or poor or faithless, or in any 
way in need of succor and assistance, that that which is needful might be 
rendered unto them. 

A considerable increase is shown in the labors of our people in the 
temples. During the year 1916, 419,257 ordinances were performed in 
our temples. Of that number, 66,035 were performed in the Manti tem- 
ple; 131,805 in the Logan temple; 28,003 in the St. George temple, and 
193,414 in -the Salt Lake temple. In 1916, the ordinances performed 
were 88,000 in excess of the previous year, and is the largest in the 
history of the Church. 

The Latter-day Saints Hospital has reached its full capacity in the 
accommodation of patients. The Dee Hospital has also been running at 
its full capacity. 

Since our last conference, the Idaho stake of Zion has been organ- 
ized, being part of the Bannock stake, with Nelson J. Hogan, president ; 
and the following wards have been organized :

Elder Sylvester Q. Cannon has been appointed president of the Pio- 
neer stake, and Elder S. Norman Lee, president of the Box Elder stake. 

President Wm. Gardner, of the New Zealand mission, who returned 
in 1916, was succeeded by Elder Jas. Lambert as mission president. 

Elder Hyrum W. Valentine, president of the Swiss and German Mis- 
sion, has succeeded in getting home safely, and Elder Angus J. Cannon 
has taken hjs place as president of the Swiss-German Mission. By the 
way, we have been warned that it was not prudent to use the word 
"German" mission, in connection with the appointment of our elders, as 
our dear English neighbors were a little jealous of that name. We there- 
fore dropped the word "German," and it now is the Swiss M : ssion. 

Since our last conference, President Francis M. Lyman of the 
Council of the Twelve, has passed away, and Elder Heber J. Grant has 
been appointed President of the Twelve. Elder Stephne L. Richards 
has been appointed a member of the Council of the Twelve. 

Elder Joseph S. Wells, of the General Church Auditing Committee, 
has also passed away. 

Of the presidents of the stakes of Zion, we have lost by the hand of 
death since our last conference, President Oleen N. Stohl of the Box 
Elder stake, President William McLachlan of the Pioneer stake, and 
President George E. Stoddard of the Union stake. 

The following brethren and a sister laboring in the mission field 
have passed away: 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 11 

Horace S. Brown, of Kanab, Utah, died in South Carolina, Southern 
States Mission, April 6, 1916, typhoid fever. 

Wilford I. Freckleton of Eureka, Utah, died in Hull, British Mis- 
sion, February 27, 1917, of spinal meningitis. 

Herald Eugene Smith, of Provo, Utah, died at Honolulu, Hawaiian 
Mission, September 11, 1916, of kidney trouble. 

Leonard J. Wayment, of Warren, Utah, died July 21, 1916, upon 
reaching home from the British Mission. 

Sister Adella Haynie, of Manassa, Colorado, died at Saint Louis. 
Missouri, Feb. 7, 1916. 

NO NATIONALITIES AMONG THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

In speaking of nationalities we all understand or should that in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there is neither Greek, nor 
Jew, nor Gentile; in other words, there is neither Scandinavian, nor- Swiss, 
nor German, nor Russian, nor British, nor any other nationality. We have 
become brothers in the household of faith, and we should treat the 
people from these nations that are at war with each other, with due kind- 
ness and consideration. It is nothing but natural that people who are 
born in a land, though they may have emigrated from it, who have left 
their kindred there, many of them, that they will naturally have a tender 
feeling toward their Fatherland. But the Latter-day Saints who have 
come from England, and from France and from Germany and Scandi- 
navia and Holland, into this country, no matter what their country may 
he involved in, it is not our business to distinguish them in any way 
by criticism or by complaint toward them, or by condemnation, because 
of the place where they were born. They could not help where they 
were born, and they have come here to be Latter-day Saints, not to be 
Germans, nor to be Scandinavians, nor to be English or French, nor to 
belong to any other country in the world. They have come here to be 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and good 
and true citizens of the United States, and of the several states in which 
they live, and other places throughout the world, where Latter-day 
Saints are building homes for themselves. 

I have heard the story that a poor girl was actually denied employ- 
ment, in an American household, because she happened to be horn in 
a foreign land, and because there is such a great prejudice wrought in 
the minds of some of the people against that country — not against the 
people ; the people are innocent, the people are blameless. You must 
not condemn the people, however much you may judge and condemn 
their leaders, who place their people in jeopardy, and demand their life 
blood for their maintenance in position of prominence and power. Their 
leaders are to blame, not the people. The people that embrace the gospel 
are innocent of these things, and they ought to be respected by Latter- 
day Saints everywhere. Treat our neighbors, our brethren and sisters 
that have come to Zion for the purpose of worshiping God according 
to the dictates of their conscience, like Latter-day Saints, not as English, 
or French, or Scandinavians, or Germans. They are Latter-day Saints. 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

They are our brethren and our sitsers, our neighbors, and they are help- 
ing to build up this great country of ours, and we must respect them 
and uphold them in the purest kindness, love and compassion, and with 
sorrow that their native countries are in the terrible plight that they are, 
for which they are not responsible. 

THE TRUTH HAS MADE US FREE. 

May God bless you. Forgive me for trespassing so long upon your 
valued time. I feel in my heart the truth, I believe I am right with the 
help of God. I claim nothing for myself. I am nothing of myself, but 
the truth has made me free, and I thank God for it. I can face my 
brother and my sister anywhere in the world, in life or death with the 
consciousness that I have never wronged one of my fellow beings that I 
know of, and I think I know. I therefore feel that I am right; and if so 
— it is tdue to the gospel, and to my association with men of God, all the 
way down from my childhood, and I am thankful for it. I feel proud and 
grateful and most happy that I am associated with you. I look upon 
the faces of this multitude of men before me and I recognize in them, 
as every honest man must, the features and faces of noble, honest men ; 
men who have lived pure lives ; and the women are the best that ever 
lived. There are no wives better than our wives. There are no mothers 
better than our mothers, no sisters better than our sisters, nor any quite 
so good, as we believe. They are the best in all the world. That is my 
testimony. God bless you, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

given us this morning by our Presi- 
dent. I endorse what he has said, 
and I know you have all felt that 
what he has counseled us to do, we 
ought to do. In regard to the crit- 
ical time in which we are living, I 
hope that we will remember these 
virtues which the Lord has com- 
manded us to cultivate. Many 
things may come about which may 
cause feelings and passions to rise 
against those with whom our na- 
tion is at war, but we want to re- 
member that those with whom we 
are associated religiously, be they of 
whatever nation they may, are Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Now in this and 
other states where there are Latter- 
day Saints, we have a splendid cit- 
izenry from those countries with 
which the United States, perhaps, 
will be at war. They have come 
here of their own choice. They 
have selected this country on ac- 
count of its free institutions, and 
they feel that they belong here. 
They are American citizens. Now 
let us not treat them as if they 
were against us, but .do everything 
to make them feel that we are all 
American citizens. 

We are a people of peace. We 
do not love war, but in order to 
defend our homes we have been 
obliged to go to war. In early days 
here in Utah we tried to keep 
peace with the Indians. President 
Brigham Young said it was better 
to feed the Indians than to fight 
them, and that humane policy kept 
us from much bloodshed, and help- 
ed us to .develop the country. Still 
we had wars with them. Some of 
the unruly Indians would take our 
cattle, and kill our men and women, 
and we had to go out to fight them 
in order to defend ourselves, and 
we did not feel that we were going 



contrary to the commands of God 
in doing this. 

Now, as we are an integral part 
of the United States, if the United 
States shall be attacked we will 
take our part with them in defend- 
ing our country. I hope our 
parents will teach their young men 
who may be called into war, that 
to be a soldier does not mean to 
throw away their ideas of right and 
morality and godliness, but that 
they will go as did the two thou- 
sand young men led by Helaman 
of whom we read in the Book of 
Mormon, and, like the young Ne- 
phites, keep themselves free from 
the things that defile. Let them be 
prayerful and God-fearing, and 
then go and in his name perform 
their duties. 

This day is the birthday of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, which Church was or- 
ganized eighty-seven years ago. On 
that day a number of those who 
had been baptized, and their 
friends, met in Fayette, Seneca 
-county, New York, and there or- 
ganized the Church. In the month 
of May, preceding, Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery received the 
Aaronic 'Priesthood, under the 
hands of John, called in the scrip- 
tures John the Baptist, who reveal- 
ed to them the correct manner and 
purpose of baptism, after which 
Joseph baptized Oliver Cowdery 
and Oliver baptized Joseph Smith. 
Afterwards they received a glorious 
visit, Peter, James and John, who 
held the presidency of the Melchiz- 
edek Priesthood in former days of 
the Church, appeared and bestowed 
upon them that priesthood ; so that 
on the 6th of April, 1830, when the 
Church was organized, these two 
men held the Melchizedek Priest- 
hood as well as the Aaronic Priest- 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hood. They had already baptized 
a small number of members who 
met on that day and took part in 
the Church organization. Then to 
follow the order of the priesthood, 
in accordance with the command of 
God, Joseph and Oliver ordained 
each other elders, after having 
been accepted by those present to 
be the first two elders in the 
Church. Those baptized received 
then the Holy Ghost by the laying 
on of hands of Joseph and Oliver. 
On that day they also partook of 
the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup- 
per, to remember the great atone- 
ment wrought by our Savior, which 
event we also celebrate today. We 
remember with deepest gratitude 
that he gave his life to justify us 
before God, and to make it possi- 
ble that we could be at one with our 
heavenly Father. "That great of- 
fering," as we sing, "by man least 
understood," was made by him in 
accordance with the will of the 
Father, and he became our Savior 
and Redeemer. 

Now the Church was organized,- 
but not with all the officers of the 
Church as we have them today, for 
the simple reason they did not have 
enough members in the Church to 
make a complete organization. Ten 
months after the Church was or- 
ganized Edward Partridge was or- 
dained a Bishop to the Church, and 
in June following the first high 
priests were ordained. In Decem- 
ber, 1833, Joseph Smith, Senior, 
was ordained a patriarch, and two 
months later the first High Council 
was organized. The quorum of 
Twelve apostles was organized 
February 14, 1835, and two weeks 
later a quorum of seventies was or- 
ganized. All the offices in the 
priesthood were now established 
and men were ordained to fill them. 



In regard to Church government 
I will state that during the first 
thirteen months all Church business 
was done by conferences of elders 
presided over by Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery. Several of the 
leading brethren were now ordained 
High Priests who afterwards form- 
ed the presiding quorum of the 
Church. In March, 1832, Joseph 
was called by revelation to be Pres- 
ident of the Church, and a month 
later he was sustained as President 
of the High Priests' quorum. Next 
spring, March 18, 1833, the First 
Presidency was organized and sus- 
tained, consisting bf three High 
Priests : Joseph Smith, President, 
Sidney Rigdon, First Counselor, 
and Frederick G. Williams, Second 
Counselor. 

Some may ask, was not this a 
kind of evolution of Church gov- 
ernment from that directed by 
elders to the present form, during 
which time the leaders gradually 
added offices in the Melchizedek 
Priesthood according to their own 
notions, and as an after thought 
added patriarchs, apostles and sev- 
enties? The answer is that this 
was not the case. Already in June, 
1829, before the Church was organ- 
ized, the Lord told Joseph Smith 
that Oliver Cowdery and David 
Whitmer should seek out the 
twelve, and their mission was 
defined. In a revelation given 
on the same day ■ the organiza- 
tion took place the Lord says : 
"Behold, there shall be a record 
kept among you, and in it thou 
shall be called a seer, a trans- 
lator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus 
Christ." The preceding section (20) 
of the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, called a revelation on Church 
government, explains the dutjes of 
the different officers of the Church,

and the rules laid .down there are 
still followed and considered the 
law of the Church. This shows that 
the plan of the organization of the 
Church was definitely given to the 
Church at the beginning and that 
it did not have its origin and de- 
velopment in the ideas of men. We 
rejoice in knowing that it was God- 
given. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I see 
the time is up. I rejoice to be here 
with you and see so many here on 
this day of opening, and again I 
want to impress upon you the ne- 
cessity of following the counsel of 
our President, given to us this 
morning. God bless you all. Amen. 

The choir and congregation 
sang: "Praise to the man who 
communed with Jehovah." 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder Junius F. Wells. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

President Joseph F. Smith pre- 
sided, and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock p. m. 

The choir and congregation 
sang: "Zion stands with hills sur- 
rounded." 

Prayer was offered by President 
Heber Q. Hale, of the Boise stake 
of Zion. 

A solo : "I know that my Re- 
deemer liveth," was sung by Mrs. 
Lucile Wells. 

PREST. CHARLES W. PENROSE. 

Significance of the crucifixion and res- 
urrection of Jesus Christ — A great 
privilege is enjoyed by the Latter- 
day Saints in being members by 
baptism of the true Church of 



Christ — As a consequence and be- 
cause of individual agency, their re- 
sponsibility is great and they will 
be called to judgment for their 
works — The character of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ pertaining 
to resistance and non-resistance — 
What he requires of us in this mat- 
ter, and how the true Christian 
should regard war' — He is justified 
only when he fights for liberty and 
right, and then it should be done 
without passion or a desire to shed 
blood,but in a spirit of justice, right- 
eousness and equity — Peace shall 
yet prevail and the way be opened 
for the servants of God to preach 
the gospel tidings to the nations 
that sit in darkness. 

This is a great privilege ex- 
tended to all of us who are in this 
assembly, this afternoon, to be able 
to attend this conference and to 
meet in this tabernacle ; and I con- 
gratulate all who were present this 
morning in having the opportunity 
of hearing the address of our be- 
loved president, Joseph F. Smith. 
One gentleman present, who was 
not of our faith and who has come 
from the far east on other bus- 
iness than attending this confer- 
ence, stated to a friend here that 
it was well worth a trip across the 
continent to hear that address from 
President Smith ; and I endorse his 
statement, for I felt the same way, 
that if there was nothing else pre- 
sented to this conference of people 
gathered from various parts of 
these mountain valleys and some 
from abroad, they would be well 
repaid for coming here and having 
the privilege of hearing the words 
of inspiration and instruction that 
were imparted to us. 

I rejoice in being privileged this 
afternoon to stand up and bear tes- 
timony to the truth of those re- 
marks. They went down deep into 
my soul. It was truly a time of re- 
joicing, of an outpouring of the 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Spirit of God ; and while the world 
abroad has an outpouring of the 
spirit of war, we had an outpouring 
of the spirit of peace, the true spirit 
of our Lord Jesus Christ who is our 
spiritual head, in whose Church we 
have membership. We have the 
blessing of being part of the body 
of Christ. This 'is his Church, 
named after him and by him, and it 
is still under his direction. It is 
Christ's Church, and it is he who 
has given to us the revelations 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and his successors, particularly 
those things that are contained in 
the Doctrine and Covenants given 
to us in this day for the benefit of 
this his Church, which he has de- 
clared shall prevail over every foe, 
if his people, the Saints of the Most 
High, will observe the covenants 
and commandments which he has 
revealed to them for their present 
guidance and eternal salvation. 

The beautiful poem which has 
just been sung to us brings to mind 
some things that I had not thought 
of particularly today. We are liv- 
ing at a time celebrated through- 
out Christendom as the day of the 
crucifixion. Next Sunday is called 
Easter Sunday, celebrated as the 
day of the resurrection, and the 
words sung to us so clearly this af- 
ternoon were the words of an 
ancient saint, one of the most an- 
cient of writers or prophets whose 
writings have been preserved. 
They are the words of Job, and 
have come down to us in the Old 
Testament scriptures : 

"For I know that my Redeemer 
liveth, and that he shall stand at 
the latter day upon the earth : 

"And though, after my skin, 
worms destroy this body, yet in 
my flesh shall I see God" (Job. 
19:25,26. 



I have wondered often how it is 
that our friends in the various sects 
of modern Christendom have not 
perceived the fulness of the truth 
contained in those words of Job. 
They profess to believe in life after 
death ; they believe that when peo- 
ple die they either go to heaven or 
to hell, and that Jesus Christ died 
and appeared afterwards to his 
apostles, but they do not believe 
that he appeared to them in the 
flesh. That is very strange, when 
the descriptions that we have, writ- 
ten by the apostles who saw him, 
declare that they beheld the marks 
of the nails that were driven 
through his hands upon the cross, 
and the mark of the Roman spear 
in his side, and he declared to them 
that he was not a mere spirit. He 
did not come to them to make them 
believe in life after death simply, 
because they believed that before ; 
that was believed even by the Phar- 
isees and other sects in Judea, but 
he said : "Behold, my hands and my 
feet, that it is I, myself ; handle me, 
and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh 
and bones, as ye see me have. And 
while they yet believed not for joy, 
and wondered, he said unto them: 
Have ye here any meat? And they 
gave him a piece of a broiled fish 
and of an honeycomb, and he took 
it and did eat before them" (Luke 
24:41-43). What was this for? Evi- 
dently to demonstrate to them the 
truth of the doctrine of the resur- 
rection from the dead. Not merely 
the truth of the doctrine of the 
continuation of life after death, the 
life of the spirit when the body is 
in the grave, but the doctrine of 
the resurrection, the raising up 
again of the body from the dust. 
This must be very clear to those 
who read and do not try to misin- 
terpret. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



17 



We have the testimonies of many 
of the apostles in the New Testa- 
ment ; and the Apostle Paul, in the 
fifteenth chapter of what is called 
the First Epistle to the Corinth- 
ians, relates the circumstances of 
Christ's death and of his burial and 
of his resurrection from the dead, 
and of his appearance at a number 
of times to his apostles and after- 
ward to five hundred of the breth- 
ren, all at once, and of his ascen- 
sion into heaven. And Paul adds 
his own personal testimony to hav- 
ing seen him, Jesus of Nazareth 
raised from the dead, and the argu- 
ment that he offers in regard to the 
resurrection from the dead is based 
upon these statements that I have 
briefly referred to. "Now, is Christ 
risen from the dead and become the 
first fruits of them that slept." Then 
he goes on to argue that if Christ 
was raised from the dead, we shall 
be raised also, and that if Christ 
was not raised from the dead, then 
we are dead to all intents and pur- 
poses when we lay our bodies 
down ; "but now is Christ risen 
from the dead," was his testimony. 

In addition to these things con- 
tained in the New Testament, in- 
cluding what the Lord showed to 
John in that great vision upon the 
Isle of Patmos, we have the testi- 
mony in the Book of Mormon, that 
Jesus Christ appeared on this con- 
tinent to the Nephites, and showed 
them also the marks of the nails in 
his hands and the mark of the spear 
in his side, that they might under- 
stand that the doctrine of the actual 
resurrection from the dead is a true 
doctrine and that by his being 
raised from the dead he became, 
what he proclaimed himself to be, 
"the resurrection and the life," de- 
claring with that the doctrine that 



the time should come when "all that 
are in the graves shall hear his 
voice, and shall come forth ; they 
that have done good, unto the res- 
urrection of life ; and they that have 
done evil, unto the resurrection of 
damnation" (John 5:28,29). Now, 
in these last days, we have the testi- 
mony of Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigdon in the 76th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that they 
also beheld Christ on the right hand 
of God, the risen Redeemer, having 
power to bring others forth from 
the tomb and that by him and 
through him, according to their or- 
der, all the human race shall be 
brought forth. All the sons and 
daughters of Adam and Eve are 
to be raised from the dead in the 
order that is prepared, to enter into 
some degree of glory, if they are fit 
for it, while a few of the inhab- 
itants of the earth, having received 
the light and then fought against 
it, having obtained the spirit that 
comes from that evil one who has 
the power of death ; having in their 
souls a desire to shed blood and 
having accomplished that desire, 
sinning against the Holy Ghost, 
sinning against the most sacred 
covenants that men could enter 
into, they cannot enter into 
glory, but even they also are 
to be raised from the dead and to 
go into their proper place as related 
in the eighty-eighth section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. We have 
the testimony of others, some that 
are living, who have seen the Lord, 
the Savior, the Christ risen from 
the dead ; in vision they have seen 
him. All these testimonies, added 
together make a wonderful body of 
evidence concerning the reality of 
the resurrection from the dead. 
Now we who have gathered here. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we Latter-day Saints, as I have 
said, belong to his Church. He 
made it, he has set it up, he con- 
trols it, his Spirit is in it, and it is 
by that Spirit that all the revela- ' 
tions that are placed on record un- 
der his name have been given ; and, 
I thank God it is also by that 
Spirit we still are led, not only 
by the inspiration given to our lead- 
ers, but the inspiration given to ev- 
ery one of us in our own souls if 
we have really received the truth 
and are walking in the light there- 
of. For the Spirit of Jesus Christ 
rests down upon the body of the 
Church, and according to their 
faithfulness, and their obedience to 
his commandments, they are en- 
lightened of him by the power of 
the Holy Spirit which proceedeth 
from the presence of God through- 
out the immensity of space, by 
which he comprehends them, by 
which his eye can pierce them all ; 
he himself being in the bosom of 
eternity, a personality, as testified 
by President Smith this morning, 
an individual in whose likeness we 
have been formed, who is the literal 
father as well as the spiritual 
Father of Jesus of Nazareth who 
is our living head, who is the head 
of this Church and whose Spirit 
dwells in it and enlightens all who 
are willing to receive the light. 

What a blessed privilege it is 
that we enjoy as Latter-day Saints, 
to be baptized unto him, not merely 
to be born of water by being bap- 
tized in water, but being enveloped 
baptized, invigorated, enlightened 
by the power of that Holy Spirit 
which quickens all things through 
Jesus Christ our Lord ! And it is 
he that we acknowledge as our 
Savior and our Redeemer, and we 
look to him for our resurrection 



at our proper time from the dead 
to stand before God and give an 
account for the deeds done in the 
mortal body. This is something 
worth thinking about. We are re- 
sponsible beings and therefore the 
Lord will cause us to give an ac- 
count of ourselves and to stand and 
be judged by our record. We are 
responsible because responsibility 
was born into us in our spiritual, 
first-being, our pre-existence — the 
power of volition, the power of 
agency. He that has an agency of 
his own has in his being, born of 
the Eternal Father, the power, not 
only of volition, but the power of 
choice, the power of choosing good 
or evil, the power of rejecting good 
or evil, and in the exercise of that 
he is responsible for all that he 
does, and because of that responsi- , 
bility comes the doctrine of eternal 
judgment, so that all mankind will 
be judged "according to their 
works, out of the things written in 
the books." What kind of books 
they are it doesn't matter so much, 
only they will be books that will 
contain our record and our record 
will be brought forth and according 
to our doings, so are we ; according 
to our acts, so we are. If we do 
evil, evil impressions come natural- 
ly, and if we love to do good a 
good influence, a good spirit, is with 
us, and round about us, and in our 
being and we are sustained and 
supported thereby; and if we are 
corrupt and wicked and abominable 
and rebellious, the effects of our 
acts are right in our nature, and 
these things will be disclosed just 
as naturally as the opening of books 
made of paper and written upon 
with ink. 

These are serious thoughts that 
should come to us at this season of 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

the year. Whether the dates that 
people have set are exactly right or 
not, matters not so much. This is 
the time of the crucifixion and the 
interment and the resurrection from 
the dead, of the greatest Being who 
ever walked upon this earth, the 
first-born of God in the spirit, the 
only begotten Son in the flesh, the 
Redeemer of the world, the Savior 
of mankind whom we adore and 
in whose name we worship the true 
and the living God. Jesus Christ 
our Redeemer has been kind 
enough to reveal a great many 
splendid, glorious truths and given 
to us a great many instructions for 
our conduct, what we should do 
as members of his Church, and we 
have opportunities of learning these 
things. Many of them are written 
in the books that are printed, and 
we could read them if we would 
have them at hand. We should 
have them in our homes — the Bible, 
the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine 
and Covenants, the Pearl of Great 
Price and the different publications 
that are given to us for our guid- 
ance and direction. In these we 
can learn concerning our Father in 
heaven and concerning Jesus Christ 
our Redeemer, and all the revela- 
tions that we have for our guid- 
ance and direction have come from 
him. This is what we read in the 
revelations in the Doctrine and 
Covenants : "Listen to the voice 
of Jesus Christ, the great I Am." 
Now, the character of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ is some- 
times misunderstood and misinter- 
preted, even by those who read 
about him in the New Testament. 
I know when I was a litle boy and 
went to Sunday School, we used to 
sing : "Gentle Jesus, . meek and 
mild, look on me a little child." 
That was all very good, so far as it 



went. He was meek and lowly of 
heart. He was kind- and affection- 
ate and full of love and charity, of 
a desire to bless, to lift up, to exalt. 
That was his nature and spirit, and 
he is called the Prince of Peace 
and the Lamb slain from' the found- 
ations of the world, lamb-like in 
his character, lamb-like when he 
was led to the slaughter, and "as a 
sheep before its shearers is dumb, 
so opened he not his mouth" when 
he was falsely accused ; meek of 
character, willing to forgive his bit- 
terest enemies as he manifested 
when he was on the cross. But 
there was another side to his char- 
acter. He taught that under cer- 
tain conditions people should be 
willing to forgive, and when they 
were smitten on one cheek to turn 
the other. 

This puts me in mind of a cir- 
cumstance that occurred when I 
was laboring on a mission in Lon- 
don many, many years ago : We 
had an old gentleman there that 
had been in the army. He was a 
war veteran and he was preaching 
the gospel of Jesus Christ on the 
streets. A man came up and 
slapped him on the face. "Now," 
he says, "if you are a Christian turn 
the other cheek." So old daddy 
turned the other cheek, but he said : 
"Hit again and down you go." He 
would have gone down, too, if he 
had struck again. True, Jesus 
Christ taught that non-resistance, 
was right and praiseworthy and a 
duty under certain circumstances 
and conditions ; but just look at him 
when he went into the temple, when 
he made that scourge of thongs, 
when he turned out the money- 
changers and kicked over their ta- 
bles and told them to get out of the 
house of the Lord ! "My house is 
a house of prayer," he said, "but ye 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have made it a den of thieves." Get 
out of here! ' Hear him crying, 
"Woe unto you Scribes, Pharisees, 
hypocrites, ye compass sea and land 
to make one proselyte, and then ye 
make him ten-fold more the child 
of hell than he was before." That 
was the other - side of the spirit of 
Jesus. Jesus was no milksop. He 
was not to be trampled under foot. 
He was ready to submit when the 
time came for his martyrdom, and 
he was to be nailed on the cross as a 
sacrifice for the sins of the world, 
but he was ready at any time to stand 
up for his rights like a man. He is 
not only called "the Lamb slain 
from the foundation of the world," 
but also "the Lion of the Tribe of 
Judah," and He will be seen to be 
terrible by and by to his enemies. 

Now while we are not particular- 
ly required to pattern after the 
"lion" side of his character unless 
it becomes necessary, the Lord does 
not expect us to submit to be trod- 
den under foot by our enemies and 
never resist. The Lord does nor 
w^nt us to inculcate the spirit of 
war nor the spirit of bloodshed. In 
fact he has commanded us not to 
shed blood, but there are times and 
seasons, as we can find in the his- 
tory of the world, in Bible and the 
Book of Mormon, when it is jus- 
tifiable and right and proper and 
the duty of men to go forth in the 
defense of their homes and their 
families and maintain their privil- 
eges and rights by force of arms. 
On this subject I might read some- 
thing to you if there were plenty of 
time, but you can read it yourselves 
when you get home. Read the 
101st section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, then read the 98th sec- 
tion. 

In section 101 the Lord speaks 
about the constitution of this land. 



He says it was framed by wise men 
whom he raised up for that very 
purpose. What for? To maintain 
the rights and privileges "of all 
flesh." Not alone the people of 
this land. The principles of that 
great instrument are to go forth 
to the nations, and the time will 
come when they will prevail, just as 
sure as the sun shines even when it 
appears to be in darkness and the 
clouds are over it. And the Lord 
says, concerning the works of those 
great men, "And redeemed the land 
by the shedding of blood." Shed- 
ding of blood ! Does the Lord per- 
mit the shedding of blood and justi- 
fy it? Yes, sometimes he does. 
Was not the war of independence 
of this country justifiable? Were 
not the rights and privileges of the 
people of this land trampled under 
foot, and did they not rise in their 
might and the God of Battles 
strengthen their arms and they 
went forth to victory and brought 
liberty, not only to themselves and 
their immediate families, but to 
hosts of people from down-trodden 
Europe who are rejoicing today un- 
der the Stars and Stripes with lib- 
erty of conscience and liberty of 
speech and liberty of action within 
proper guidance and direction of 
righteous law. These principles are 
to go forth to all flesh. Don't you 
forget it. The time will come when 
they will be carried to all the na- 
tions of the earth and they will be 
delivered from tyrants and oppres- 
sors. 

In the 98th section the Lord 
gives the law that he gave in an- 
cient time to his people when they 
were to go forth to battle : It is 
in substance: "If thine enemy come 
against thee, thou shalt forgive 
him ; if he come again the second 
time, thou -shalt forgive him; and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



21 



if he even come the third time and 
you forgive him it will be reckoned 
unto you for glory, but if he come 
again I, the Lord, justify you in 
going forth to battle and I will 
strengthen you and I will fight your 
battles." Now the great distinction 
should be, and we should under- 
stand it, that circumstances may 
arise which will require a different 
precept from that given at one time 
when another time comes. In the 
22nd chapter of Luke, you will read 
that Jesus, just before he was taken 
by the men that came out to bring 
him before the judgment seat, cried 
out to his apostles : "When I sent 
you without purse and scrip and 
shoes, lacked ye anything? And 
they said, Nothing." Then said he, 
but now "let him that hath a purse 
take it, and likewise his scrip, and 
he that hath no sword, let him sell 
his garments and buy one" (verses 
35, 36). Well, some people will say, 
perhaps, then, the Lord is a change- 
able being. Not at all. The Lord 
always is like that. From the eter- 
nities that are past down to 
the present, when circumstances 
change, he adapts his laws to those 
conditions and gives his people 
counsel and instructions suited to 
the times and the circumstances. 

Now, in this 98th section I spoke 
of, the Lord says this was the word 
of guidance to his servants in an- 
cient times when he told them to go 
forth to battle for the right, and 
he gave commandments to them to 
do so, and we can read about them 
in the Old Testament, and he says, 
"this is a law unto all people, all 
flesh," so that circumstances alter 
cases, as the old proverb has it. 
Now if a nation essays to go forth 
against another nation for the pur- 
pose of conquest, to gain territory, 
to grasp something that does not 



belong to that nation, then the na- 
tion thus assailed has the right to 
resist even to the shedding of blood, 
as it was in this land in the war 
for independence. But we have to 
be careful as to what spirit we are 
guided by. If we want to go out 
to battle, to encroach upon other 
peoples' liberties and rights, to gain 
their lands, to destroy their prop- 
erty without any right or reason, 
that is one thing; but if somebody 
comes against us to destroy us and 
our property and our homes and 
our rights and our privileges, either 
on land or sea, then we have the 
right under the divine law to rise 
for our own protection and take 
such steps as are necessary. But, as 
we were exhorted this morning by 
our President, we Latter-day Saints 
must watch ourselves and not give 
way to passion and desire to shed 
blood and to destroy, for that is the 
power of the evil one. We do not 
want to imitate any nation that is 
bent on a policy of destruction, to 
destroy where they cannot rule, to 
break down and trample under foot 
where they cannot dominate. If we 
have that desire, it is the spirit of 
the wicked one. 

But when the time comes that 
we, as a part of this great nation, 
are called upon by the rulers and 
leaders of affairs of the country and 
they are justified in the course that 
they are pursuing, then, I think, we 
are required to stand with them for 
the rights of the nation of which 
we form a part, and do our bound- 
en duty, but to do it in the spirit 
that the President showed to us 
this morning, as the true spirit of 
Jesus Christ, desiring that mankind 
may repent, desiring that they may 
turn from their wicked ways, de- 
siring that they may be brought to 
a condition wherein they will de- 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sire peace. But while they rise 
against us and seek our destruction, 
is it not our right, our privilege, as 
Christians, yea, as Latter-day 
Saints, to stand for those rights, to 
defend our homes, our wives, our 
children, our possessions, every- 
thing that we have gained law- 
fully, but not to go forth even 
against our enemies to desire their 
destruction and soak the earth with 
more blood, to devastate and bring 
misery and trouble by conquest in 
other lands ; not at all ; and we can 
differentiate between the two con- 
ditions. There is a very great dif- 
ference between arising to go forth 
for conquest, for blood, for plun- 
der, to gain territory and power in 
the earth, and in fighting to defend 
our own possessions in the spirit of 
justice and righteousness and 
equity, and standing up like men 
for those things that we have a 
right to contend for. 

Now I think that is the spirit of 
Jesus Christ when I come to view 
him personally from both sides of 
his character. He was a mighty 
man. He was a man to all intents 
and purposes in every particular, 
the Son of the living God, the very 
express image of his Father and 
our Father, his God and our God, 
who some day will rule this world, 
and Jesus the Christ, the Son of the 
living God, will be our King and 
we will follow him wherever he 
leads. That time shall come. As 
Isaiah predicted : "Behold a king 
shall reign in righteousness, and 
princes shall rule in judgment" 
(Chap. 32). Brethren and sisters, 
that time is coming and the work 
in which you and I are engaged is 
to prepare the way, and the spirit 
that must be in our hearts is the 
spirit of righteousness, for that is 
what will bring peace. There will 



never be peace to rule in the world 
until righteousness is established ; 
ighteous knowledge, righteous liv- 
ing, righteous acts, righteous aims, 
righteous union, united faith. When 
that day shall dawn, Christ shall 
come and be our king, and we read 
that the "effect of righteousness 
shall be peace." 

That is it. The effect of right- 
eousness shall be peace, but while 
unrighteousness and despotism and 
tyranny and inequality in regard to 
the rights of men shall persist in 
the world, there will be wars and 
rumors of wars, and there will be 
destruction and sorrow and pain, 
and nation will rise against nation 
and kingdom against kingdom, and 
there will be trouble, as the Lord 
predicted, such as there never was 
in the earth before. If we are not 
approaching that time very closely, 
I miss my guess, but my personal 
belief is that the Lord will over- 
rule. The Lord does not kill peo- 
ple, the Lord does not tell nations 
to rise and make conquests, but the 
Lord sits above and while many of 
the people on the earth are making 
their plans, "He that sitteth in the 
heavens," as the psalmist says, 
"shall laugh," and the time will 
come when he will overturn all 
their plans and devices and turn 
them around to accomplish his own 
divine purposes, and war shall be 
overcome, even if but for a time, 
and peace shall prevail and the way 
shall open for the servants of Jesus 
Christ to go forth in the power and 
spirit of the holy priesthood and 
publish the glad tidings of great joy 
revealed from heaven in the last 
days to all people, e and thousands 
upon thousands shall turn unto the 
Lord and repent and bow in hum- 
ble submission to his will. And 
the way shall be prepared for the 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE.

establishment of Zion in all her 
strength and beauty and glory, and 
she shall be clothed upon with 
everything that is lovely, and Christ 
our Redeemer and her king shall 
come and "reign in Mount Zion 
and in Jerusalem and before his 
ancients gloriously." God help us 
all to do our duty and to perform 
it as the Lord shall direct through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "High on the moun- 
tain top." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 

An expressed desire for the welfare of 
the Saints — A sleigh ride with Brig- 
ham Young — The speaker's testi- 
mony to the honor, virtue, integrity 
and uprightness of the General Au- 
thorities — Our young missionaries 
have converted many to "Mormon- 
ism," but seldom, if ever has any 
one of them been converted to other 
faiths, which is a testimony of the 
divinity of this work — A tribute to 
the life and labors of President 
Francis M. Lyman. 

I rejoice in again having the op- 
portunity of meeting with the 
Saints in general conference. I 
have enjoyed the remarks that have 
been made thus far, and in humility 
I pray that the same good Spirit 
which has inspired all that has been 
said may continue during the re- 
mainder of the meeting today, and 
through the entire conference. I 
desire an interest in your faith and 
your prayers, that the remarks 
which I may make may be made 
under the inspiration of the Spirit 
of the Lord. When standing be- 
fore the people, I never have had 
and desire, and hope and pray that 



I never may have, except to be able 
to say something to inspire them 
to live the lives of Latter-day 
Saints. 

Fifty-four years ago, as a little 
child, I took a sleigh ride with 
President Brigham Young, that is, 
I ran out and took hold of the back 
of the sleigh, intending to ride a 
block and then drop off and walk 
home ; but President Young was 
driving such a fine team, or at least 
his driver was, that I dared not let 
go, hence rode on till we reached 
the Cottonwood, and then when the 
sleigh slowed up, to pass through 
that stream, I jumped off, and the 
President saw me. He said, "Stop, 
Brother Isaac, stop. The little boy 
is nearly frozen. Put him under 
the buffalo robe and get him warm." 
Isaac Wilson was his driver. After 
I got warm he inquired my name, 
and told me about my father, and 
his love for him. He told me to 
tell my mother that he wanted her 
to send me up to his office in six 
months to have a visit with him ; 
and in six months I went for the 
visit. From that time, fifty- four 
years ago, until the day of his 
death, I was intimately acquainted 
with President Brighami Young, 
and this I can say also with respect 
to John Taylor, and with all of the 
general authorities of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. For thirty-four years and 
a half I have been one of the gen- 
eral authorities. I have been asso- 
ciated with them in all of their 
councils. I know the hearts of these 
men. I know their desires. I know 
their devotion to God and to all that 
is for the uplift and the betterment 
of mankind. I can bear witness 
that I know, as I know that I live, 
that every word spoken here this 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



morning by President Joseph F. 
Smith, hearing witness of the hon- 
or, the virtue, the integrity, and the 
uprightness of the men who pre- 
sided over this Church, is true. I 
rejoice that in all my associations 
with the general authorities of the 
Church since I was six years of age 
I have never heard one word, in 
public or in private, fall from the 
lips of these men, but what would 
be for the benefit, for the uplift, for 
the improvement morally and intel- 
lectually, physically and spiritually 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

I rejoice that in all my travels, 
at home or abroad, I have never 
found anything, in all the world, of 
the teachings of uninspired men, 
which has had the slightest attrac- 
tion for me. I rejoice that the more 
I come in contact with the world 
and the peoples of the world, the 
more I rejoice in the strength and 
the power of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I rejoice beyond my ability 
to express it that the Lord has 
given to the Latter-day Saints, as 
individuals, a testimony, a knowl- 
edge, for themselves of the divinity 
of this work in which we are en- 
gaged, that we as individuals do not 
have to rely upon the testimony of 
others. I rejoice that all the mani- 
festations of power together with 
the gifts and graces of the gospel 
which were had in the Church when 
the Savior was upon the earth, or 
immediately following his crucifix- 
ion are enjoyed today to the fullest 
extent by the faithful, loyal, true 
and patriotic Latter-day Saints. I 
rejoice in the fact, and have often 
spoken of it in the various confer- 
ences throughout the Church, that 
as this gospel has been preached the 
world over, men and women from 
every denomination and from every 



clime have yielded obedience to 
it. I rejoice that in the preaching 
of the gospel, men with all their 
worldly wisdom have never been 
able to capture any of the loyal, 
faithful young men who have gone 
forth to proclaim it. The world 
maintains that "Mormonism," so- 
called, is not true, that our religion 
is a delusion, a snare, and a fraud, 
and that Joseph Smith was a false 
prophet. Do you mean to tell me 
that the young men of our Church, 
sweet, clean, pure, upright and hon- 
est, who have never heard anything 
but good all the days of their lives, 
would be so neglected by the Lord 
that he would not be good enough 
in eighty odd years, to show one of 
them the error of his way, and 
point out the straight and narrow 
path that leads back to him? 

Ministers of the .different sects, 
with all their worldly wisdom, have 
never been able to convert any of 
our faithful young missionaries, 
many of whom have gone forth to 
proclaim the restored gospel, with- 
out experience, education or learn- 
ing, so far as book learning is con- 
cerned ; but, on the other hand, with 
a burning testimony in their hearts 
of the divinity of this work. 

Yet some of these young men 
without experience have been able 
to convert men who have studied 
for the various religious denomina- 
tions. Men have given up their 
ministry, their pulpit, and even their 
salaries, to embrace the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which was carried to 
them by men who were humble and 
weak, so far as worldly knowledge 
was concerned, but who were pow- 
erful in a knowledge of the gospel 
and the plan of life and salvation 
which has been restored again to 
the earth through the instrumental- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



25 



ity of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Joseph Smith, it is claimed, was a 
false prophet, but 1 want to bear 
witness here today that the same 
power, the same inspiration, the 
same spirit that accompanies the 
elders in proclaiming the divinity of 
the mission of our Lord and Mas- 
ter, Jesus Christ, as the Savior of 
the world, accompanies men when 
they proclaim that Joseph Smith 
was his Prophet and his represen- 
tative in again restoring to the earth 
the plan of life and salvation. 

I want to bear witness that the 
gift of tongues, and the gift of 
healing, and the inspiration of 
Almighty God have accompanied 
the proclamation of this gospel all 
over the wide world. The evi- 
dences, the fruits of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, have accompanied the 
preaching of it in every land and in 
every clime. 

While presiding over the Euro- 
pean mission, I had occasion time 
and time again, to give instructions 
to young men who came there to 
preach the gospel — young men who 
had had no education, who had had 
no experience, and many of them 
stood up for the first time in their 
lives and bore their testimonies in 
the Liverpool office. I told them to 
study, the gospel and to pray for 
the inspiration of the Spirit of the 
Lord ; an.d promised them that if 
they would only open their mouths 
and bear witness that Jesus Christ 
was the Redeemer of the world, and 
that Joseph Smith was his prophet, 
God would give them something to 
say even though their minds at first 
were a blank. Not only a score but 
many scores of elders have borne 
witness to me that this promise was 
fulfilled, and that God did in very 
deed bless them whenever they bore 
witness of the .divinity of the mis- 



sion of Joseph Smith, the founder, 
under God, of the Church of Christ 
again upon the earth. 

I rejoice in knowing for myself, 
and not for another, that the lead- 
ers of this people were and are the 
servants of God, men who loved 
and love God, men willing to make 
sacrifices for the spread of the gos- 
pel at home and abroad. 

I feel today to bear witness be- 
fore you of the untiring energy, of 
the unceasing labors of the late 
President Francis M. Lyman who 
presided over the Council of the 
Twelve at our last general .confer- 
ence. I can remember, as a boy, 
that I always tried to get a seat 
about two-thirds of the way back, 
when coming to this tabernacle. I 
always sat on the aisle, and I can 
remember when president Lyman 
returned from his first and his sec- 
ond missions. I can remember lis- 
tening to the burning words of his 
knowledge of the gospel. I can re- 
member his preaching upon the 
Word of Wisdom, and making as 
strong an impression upon my heart 
to continue to live the Word of 
Wisdom, as any man I ever listened 
to. I can remember when he said 
that a Latter-day Saint ought to 
love the work of God more than a 
cup of coffee, or a cup of tea, or a 
chew of tobacco, or a drink of 
liquor ; that when God had revealed 
to him that this was his work, any 
convert ought to show gratitude 
enough to leave alone those things 
which God had said were not good 
for man. I can remember how he 
inspired me with a determination 
to continue to be absolutely honest 
with God in the payment of my 
tithing. I can remember how he 
said that it was the duty of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to keep an account, 
and to be as absolutely honest in 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



paying to God one-tenth of all that 
they made as if they were in part- 
nership with the Lord ; that as no 
honest Latter-day Saint would steal 
from his earthly partner, why then 
should he not be honest with God? 
I testify that he was honest. I tes- 
tify that Francis M. Lyman was an 
honest tithe-payer — honest to the 
core. I testify that he observed the 
Word of Wisdom, and in every 
ward and in every stake, wherever 
his voice was raised, he taught 
nothing but what he was himself 
practicing. He has gone from us. 
I have been almost as intimately as- 
sociated with him as a boy is with 
his father, for thirty-six years — two 
years in Tooele and thirty- four 
years in the Council of the Twelve, 
and upon all occasions, in public 
and in private, at home and abroad, 
he was always full of the spirit of 
teaching and admonition and show- 
ed forth a good example to the 
people. I have heard many people 
testify of their love for him. 

Every one of you, probably, have 
heard the sound of his voice ; and 
let me call upon you to remember 
not only the teachings of Francis M. 
Lyman but also to remember to 
follow his splendid example of hon- 
esty, integrity, diligence, and untir- 
ing energy in laboring for the ad- 
vancement of God's kingdom. If 
you will .do this, I can promise you 
that when the battle of life is ended, 
and you have the privilege of meet- 
ing President Lyman, beyond the 
veil, you will have that same joy 
when he welcomes you, which you 
have experienced here on earth 
when he put his arm around yon 
and said, "God bless you, my 
brother," or "my sister." This is 
my prayer, which may God grant, I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen, 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

The power of love — Men should be 
forgiving and when called upon 
should render judgment in a spirit 
of mercy and love — A testimony of 
Jesus and the prophet Joseph Smith 
— There is a wonderful power in 
the work of the Lord — The lead- 
ers of this Church are and have beer, 
men of God. 

It is wonderful to stand in the 
presence of this great gathering of 
Latter-day Saints. It is wonderful 
to hear the united voice of the con- 
gregation in the songs of Zion, 
singing as they do with such spirit 
and power. We are told that the 
song of the heart is a prayer unto 
the Lord. The remarks of Presi- 
dent Smith, this morning, were in- 
deed impressive. They appealed to 
me, and every word that he spoke 
was timely, and appropriate, was 
wise and prudent, and found an 
echo in my heart. The remarks 
'also of President Penrose and 
President Grant were quite in har- 
mony with the spirit of this occa- 
sion, and I rejoiced in them. 

Brethren and sisters, every phase 
of the character of the Lord shows 
forth the beauty of perfection, but 
there is no attribute of deity, it 
seems to me, that is so attractive 
and so admirable as the principle 
of forgiveness or mercy. Moses, in 
speaking of the Lord upon one oc- 
casion — I think you will find it in 
the thirty-fourth chapter of Exodus 
— says : "And the Lord passed by 
before him and proclaimed : The 
Lord God, the Lord, merciful and 
gracious, long-suffering and abund- 
ant in goodness and truth." And 
we are told in one of the psalms that 
"the Lord executeth righteousness 
and judgment for all that are op- 
pressed. He made known his ways 
to Moses, his acts to the children of

Israel. The Lord is merciful and 
gracious, slow to anger, and plente- 
ous in mercy." If this be a true 
description of him, what a glorious 
being he is. He does not act with 
hastiness, but his is a spirit of 
peace, a spirit of tranquility, a spirit 
of calmness. He is slow to anger, 
and plenteous in mercy. Now I 
take it my brethren and sisters, that 
the Lord expects us, his children 
and his Church, to become like he 
is. He said to his disciples, in the 
meridian of time, "Follow me;" 
and so I feel that this is 
the word of the Lord to us, that we 
should follow him in our daily walk 
and conversation. I think the ad- 
monition of Joseph- Smith, .the 
Prophet, is also commendable, 
when he said : "Ever keep in exer- 
cise the principles of mercy, and be 
willing to forgive your brother, or 
even your enemy, upon the least in- 
timation of repentance and asking 
forgiveness, and the Lord will be 
equally merciful unto you." How 
beautiful, how appropriate is such 
counsel to the people of the Lord ! 
I am sure that no one admires a 
man, or a woman either, who is 
stern and unforgiving in nature, but 
we are naturally drawn toward 
those who are merciful, because, as 
I understand it, the principle of 
mercy is but an expression of the 
principle of love. There is nothing 
so desirable, nothing so far-reach- 
ing, nothing so powerful in its op- 
eration, on earth, or in heaven, as 
the principle of Love. God is love, 
and man should become love in his 
conduct and in his living. 

A very great and impressive les- 
son was conveyed by the Lord to 
his people in our time, in a revela- 
tion given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. Oh, how gracious, breth- 
ren and sisters, is the word of the 



Lord to us, whether it be by the liv- 
ing oracles or by written revelation, 
and we would do well to often con- 
sult the standard works of the 
Church, the Bible, the Book of Mor- 
mon, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and the Pearl of Great Price, which 
contain the precious words of life, 
— counsel and admonition that we 
can depend upon. 

The revelation referred to is 
found in Section 64 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, beginning with the 
eighth verse. In order that I may 
be able to convey the right impres- 
sion I would like to read these 
words to you : 

"My disciples, in days of old, 
sought occasion against one an- 
other, and forgave not one another 
in their hearts, and for this evil 
they were afflicted and sorely 
chastened." 

Now you see that the spirit of 
un forgiveness is here designated a 
great evil, and surely it must be 
so, and the displeasure of the Lord 
comes upon those who indulge in 
that spirit. I think it must be from 
beneath and not from above. It is 
a spirit of jealousy, a spirit of envy, 
a spirit of fault finding. 

"Wherefore I say unto you, that 
ye ought to forgive one another, for 
he that forgiveth not his brother his 
trespass, standeth condemned be- 
fore the Lord, for there remaineth 
in him the greater sin." 

What a wonderful saying is this. 
It puts the matter, you might say, 
in a new light. The offender is less 
accountable for sin than the unfor- 
giving man who is injured, when 
his brother comes to him and con- 
fesses his sin and is willing to make 
it right, and wants to be reconciled, 
and the brother says, "No, I will 
not forgive you. I hold it against 
you. I cannot forget it. I will not

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



forget it, and I will not accept your 
offering." That man stands con- 
demned before the Lord. 

"I the Lord, will forgive whom I 
will forgive, but of you it is re- 
quired to forgive all men." 

That does not mean, my brethren 
and sisters, that the principle of jus- 
tice shall not have its weight, and 
under proper circumstances shall 
not be enforced. Justice must have 
due weight, but at the same time 
even where justice is administered, 
as for instance, by a court of juris- 
diction in the Church, the verdict, 
whatever it is, should be made in a 
spirit of mercy. 

"And ye ought to say in your 
hearts, let God judge between me 
and thee, and reward thee accord- 
ing to thy deeds." 

I do not think that any person or 
any community or any part of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints can go very far astray 
if they will cultivate the spirit of 
mercy and charity and love. 

I stand before you this afternoon 
as a witness of the truth of the 
gospel. I know that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that he suffered death 
in the flesh for the atonement of 
sin, and by reason of the great sac- 
rifice that he made we will be re- 
deemed, redeemed through his 
blood, by repentance and the forsak- 
ing of sin, and the acceptance of the 
gospel. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a true prophet of God. I know 
it just as clearly and just as fully as 
that I am standing before you. And 
I know, brethren and sisters, I re- 
joice in the knowledge, that his suc- 
cessors in office have been and are 
prophets of God, and that the divine 
authority which he held, fell upon 
h : s successors without break, so 
that all the authority of the Priest- 
hood with which Joseph Smith was 



endowed is with the Church today, 
and is the authority by which the 
Church is to be established, and the 
Saints brought together and united 
heart and soul, and by which also 
they are led along the path of safety 
and truth. I rejoice in this knowl- 
edge, and I know, as I know that I 
live, that if I will submit to 
this authority, if I will abide by 
the counsels of the Priesthood, 
if I will honor those whom God has 
honored, my file leaders, that all 
will be well with me, and that my 
redemption and my salvation is sure 
and certain. This is the feeling of 
my heart. This is my understand- 
ing. This is my testimony. Those 
who ignore counsel, those who 
trample upon the word of the Lord, 
those who turn their backs upon 
this people and upon this work, will 
go into darkness ; they will lose the 
light of truth, and their knowledge 
and their testimony will go from 
them. Oh, it is wonderful, it is 
wonderful, when you think of it, 
the power that goes with this work. 
It is the work of the Lord, as Pres- 
sident Lund said this morning. The 
Lord is proceeding to do a wonder- 
ful work in the earth, a marvelous 
work and a wonder, and so it is — it 
is to me, with my knowledge of it, 
with my experience, all that I have 
learned and all that I know about 
this work, and the spirit of the 
work, to me it is a constant wonder 
and a constant marvel. I feel to 
glorify the name of the Lord. 

I rejoice, brethren and sisters, in 
your fellowship, in your acquaint- 
ance, to know that my lot has been 
cast in the midst of the Latter-day 
Saints, and I rejoice also in the fel- 
lowship of the authorities of the 
Church. I can testify, as Presi- 
dent Smith testified this morning, 
so far as my knowledge extends — 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



29 



it is not so great as his, of course 
— but I can testify that the leaders 
of the Church — those he named and 
also including himself — were men of 
God, men of truth, men of sobriety, 
men of virtue, men of absolute re- 
liability. Their word was as good 
as their bond, and better. Their 
word if they spoke it was sufficient. 
If they made a promise you could 
depend upon it, and that is the kind 
of men that we want for leaders, 
and I am sure that is the kind of 
men that God will have to lead his 
Church, for no other class of men 
could lead this people; it would be 
impossible. 



Now I pray the blessing of the 
Lord upon you, my brethren and 
sisters, that you may be profited by 
the teachings of this conference, 
that you may carry away with you 
the spirit of it, and incorporate it 
in your lives. I ask this blessing 
for you and for me in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : "Do what is right." 

Conference adjourned until Sat- 
urday morning, 10 o'clock. 

The closing prayer was offered 
by Elder Don B. Colton, president 
of the Uintah stake of Zion. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Saturday, 
April 7, 1917, 10 a. m. 

The large assembly was called to 
order by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The representative choir and 
congregation sang: "O ye moun- 
tains high." 

Prayer was pronounced by Elder 
Willard Young. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Divinity of the mission and ministry 
of Jesus Christ, and the certainty 
of his resurrection— The iris. 1 faith 
and doctrine of a recent writer on 
higher criticism — Our knowledge of 
the resurrection gained largely from 
the Book ,of Mormon — Its' certain 
uncontaminated testimony quoted — 
Jesus declared by the Father four 
times, the fourth time to the Proph- 
et Joseph — Jesus was resurrected 
with a body of flesh and bones — 
The resurrection is the reanimation 
of the physical body, the calling 
forth of the dead bodies that are in 
their graves, to life again. 

It is a solemn and almost fearful 
thing to stand in the midst of the 
assembled hosts of Israel with the 
responsibility of addressing them 
upon the living principles of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ; and. yet it 
is also a grand privilege to pro- 
claim those glorious principles and 
to testify of those things which we 
ourselves do know. I have been 
greatly strengthened by the remarks 
of the brethren who spoke to the 
congregations yesterday. They 
spoke in the same manner as the 
servants of God usually speak. 



They proclaimed the gospel in no 
uncertain terms. There was no 
equivocation, no hesitation, but 
they declared the truth as the Holy 
Ghost gave them utterance, light 
and knowledge. I am led to repeat 
in my mind the words of that hymn 
which we have just sung, whenever 
I hear the servants of God preach 
the gospel : 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints 
of the Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in his excel- 
lent word." 

The testimonies of Presidents 
Smith and Penrose, concerning the 
divinity of the ministry and mission 
of Jesus Christ, and concerning his 
life, death and resurrection, are 
sure. They are according to the 
facts, and are in great contrast to 
the beliefs of the world upon these 
great principles. I was reading, 
last evening, an article by one of the 
most prominent and perhaps influ- 
ential and renowned representatives 
of modern Christendom, and also 
one of the chief exponents of what 
is known as higher criticism. 

It was an article upon the same 
theme which formed so large a 
part of President Penrose's dis- 
course, and which was referred to 
also by President Smith. This pa- 
per is the concluding one of a series 
of papers written on "The Last 
Days of Jesus Christ." This paper 
is entitled : "Victory," and the 
author says, in a foot-note with 
reference to his paper : "This paper 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



31 



is not, and does not purport to be, 
an argument. It is simply a con- 
fession of faith, often expressed by 
me before in sermons, essays and 
books ; not peculiar to me, but as 
old as Christendom, and the 
common heritage of Christ's pu- 
pils." Notwithstanding he declares 
his paper to be a simple confession 
of faith, I wish to read it by way of 
contrast to that which was said yes- 
terday, and to the truth upon this 
doctrine as it is set forth in the 
holy scriptures. The gentleman 
says : 

"The resurrection of Jesus Christ 
was not an extraordinary event. It 
was an extraordinary evidence of an 
ordinary event. All men die as 
Christ died. All men ever since God 
breathed into man the breath of his 
life have risen from the dead as Christ 
rose. Death and resurrection are 
synonyms. They are simply different 
aspects of the same fact. They are 
both the separation of the spirit from 
the body. Resurrection is the up- 
springing of the spirit from the body. 
Death is the decay of the body when 
the spirit has left the temporary tene- 
ment. If I believed that the resurrec- 
tion of Jesus Christ was an excep- 
tional event, I might have the dif- 
ficulty in believing which is ex- 
perienced by some of my sceptical 
friends. But I do riot think it was an 
exceptional event. It is exceptional 
only in this respect, that somehow the 
despairing disciples had evidence of 
their Master's continuing life which 
banished their despair, transformed 
their characters, and endowed them 
with new life. Did the spirit of the 
Master return to reanimate the body 
which he had left? Or did the dis- 
embodied spirit appear to the unsealed 
eyes of his disciples? I do not know. 
There are some incidents narrated in 
the gospels which indicate one conclu- 
sion, some incidents which indicate the 
other. It is not material to determine 
which opinion is correct." 

And that is what this man de- 
clares a simple confession of faith. 



I do not know how a man could . 
make a more emphatic confession 
of unbelief, or, perhaps, a more 
positive profession of disbelief. 
Death and the resurrection synony- 
mous ! It is astonishing how far 
away from the truth the learned 
who are uninspired by the Spirit 
of God can wander. Death and the 
resurrection are antonymns of the 
most pronounced type. One is the 
exact and perfect antithesis of the 
other. Death is the dissolution of 
the body, and'the resurrection is the 
reanimation of the body; yea the 
actual and literal reuniting of the 
Spirit with the body. "Not material 
to determine" whether or not the 
"Spirit reanimated the body it had 
left?" What folly! It is, possibly, 
the most material, fundamental, and 
vital question of the whole gospel. 
For if Christ be not raised from 
the dead, as related in the scrip- 
tures, then our hope is vain, and 
there is no salvation. If this man's 
doctrine is true, then the whole life 
and ministry of Christ is false, and 
Christ is not the first fruits of 
them that slept, and Christ did not 
break the bands of death, nor open 
the graves for those who die. He 
says that death and the resurrection 
both are the separation of the spirit 
from the body, or "simply different 
aspects of the same fact." The 
separation of the spirit from the 
body is not the resurrection at all. 
The resurrection is the resuscitation 
of the body which shall be taken up 
again by the spirit, and that resur- 
rection or re-uniting of the body 
and the spirit will be the redemp- 
tion of the soul of man. 

It is the mortal body that dies, 
not the immortal spirit. The spirit 
which is alive and does not die can- 
not be resurrected. The body dies 
when the spirit departs from it. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Resurrection means to come from 
death unto life, and as it is the body 
that dies, it is the body that must 
be raised up and brought to life 
again. The term resurrection is 
never used save in connection with 
the body. Now, he declares in his 
confession of faith he "does not 
know," that the disembodied spirit 
reanimated that body which .died 
when it hung crucified upon the 
cross and which was taken down 
and buried. Thank the Lord that 
the scriptures as quoted yesterday 
set forth in no uncertain terms the 
fact that that very body was reani- 
mated and resurrected and taken 
up. It did rise again on the third 
day. "If there are" as set forth 
here, "some incidents narrated in 
the gospels which indicate a con- 
trary conclusion," it is only because 
men who find such incidents are 
not enlightened by the spirit of 
truth, which would testify to them 
of the fact that Christ did arise and 
did show himself to his servants 
and did minister among them. And 
if this is to be held as uncertain, if 
it is to be held up by the spirit of 
.higher criticism to doubt, then what 
is there in the Bible history, or ac- 
count of the life and ministry of 
Jesus Christ that can be relied 
upon ? Can we not likewise hold up 
to doubt every other incident re- 
corded there concerning the Lord 
Jesus Christ? May we not doubt 
the account of his birth, and of the 
appearance of the angels upon that 
glorious occasion singing that song 
of peace on earth and good will to 
men? May we not, and are we not 
justified, in doubting the story that 
his parents took him into Egypt ; in 
doubting that, as a boy, he stood 
among the wise men discussing the 
great principles of scripture? May 
we not doubt his sermon on the 



mount, and doubt his miracles, 
doubt his selection and choosing of 
twelve apostles, and sending them 
forth to preach the gospel? We 
may doubt, nay, are we not forced 
to doubt? all of his doctrine, every- 
thing he said or did as recorded in 
the scripture, if we cannot rely up- 
on that which is declared concern- 
ing his resurrection from the dead. 
Multitudes of Christians have al- 
ready rejected the Bible as history 
because of such "simple confessions 
of faith," as here made by this 
man. There is no doubt of any of 
these things in the minds of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

We have a knowledge of the 
"truth of what is set forth in the holy 
Bible, and in this we are more for- 
tunate than the world. If it is 
true, as revealed in this dispensa- 
tion, that many great and precious 
things have been taken away from 
that book which was delivered to 
the Jews,- the Bible, the history of 
Christ and of his disciples, and as 
a result of this the world is wan- 
dering in unbelief, in disbelief, in 
doubt, and in denial of the things 
which are set forth in the holy 
scriptures, — we Latter-day Saints 
are more fortunate than the world, 
and it is our mission to so declare 
the glorious truth that the world 
may become as fortunate as are the 
Latter-day Saints with respect to 
understanding it. These many pre- 
cious things which have been taken 
out of the word of God by wicked 
men, the result of which has been to 
obscure the true word of God, as 
we find it in the scriptures, have 
been revealed again in the last days 
in the coming forth of the Book of 
Mormon. This is a volume of scrip- 
ture of equal authority and equally 
divine with the Holy Bible. It is an 
historical record wherein is pre-

33 



served in fulness and purity the 
great truths that are recorded in 
the Holy Bible, — with perhaps this 
difference, that those precious parts, 
which make clear the truth to the 
understanding of every rational 
man, are not missing, but they are 
supplied. President Penrose yes- 
terday set forth the truth concern- 
ing the resurrection of the Lord, as 
it is plainly written in the New 
Testament. He explained his ap- 
pearing before his disciples in his 
body that had been crucified, his ex- 
hibiting before them the wounds in 
his hands and feet and side, invit- 
ing them to handle him and see for 
themselves that it was not a spirit, 
but Christ himself, who had been 
crucified and buried, but had risen 
from the grave. He set forth the 
truth that Christ broke bread with 
them ; that he ate fish and honey- 
comb with them ; that he ministered 
among them and made them under- 
stand, not in some way uncertain, 
but in a most sure and positive way, 
that he indeed was alive again. 
Corroborating the scriptures and as 
a witness of the New Testament 
with reference to these great ques- 
tions, stands the Book of Mormon. 
Let us read a word or two from that 
sacred record : 

"Jesus Christ sheweth himself unto 
the people of Nephi, as the multitude 
were gathered together in the land 
Bountiful, and .did minister unto them; 
and on this wise did he shew him- 
self unto them. 

"And now it came to pass that there 
were a great multitude gathered to- 
gether, of the people of Nephi, round 
about the temple which was in the 
land Bountiful; and they were mar- 
veling and wondering one with an- 
other, and were shewing one to an- 
other the great and marvelous change 
which had taken place; 

"And they were also conversing 
about this Jesus Christ of whom the 



sign had been given concerning his 
death. 

"And it came to pass that while 
they were thus conversing one with 
another, they heard a voice as if it 
came out of heaven; and they cast 
their eyes round about, for they un- 
derstood not the voice which they 
heard, and it was not a harsh voice, 
neither was it a loud voice; never- 
theless, and notwithstanding it being 
a small voice, it did pierce them that 
did hear to the center, insomuch that 
there was no part of their frame that 
it did not cause to quake; yea, it did 
pierce them to the very soul, and did 
cause their hearts to burn. 

"And it came to pass that again they 
heard the voice, and they understood 
it not; 

"And again the third time they did 
hear the voice, and did open their 
ears to hear it; and their eyes were 
towards the sound thereof; and they 
did look steadfastly towards heaven, 
from whence the sound came; 

"And behold the third time they did 
understand the voice which they 
heard: and it said unto them, 

"Behold my beloved Son, in whom 
I am well pleased, in whom I have 
glorified my name; hear ye him. 

"And it came to pass as they un- 
derstood, they cast their eyes up 
again towards heaven; and behold, 
they saw a man descending out of 
heaven; and he was clothed in a white 
robe, and he came down and stood in 
the midst of them, and the eyes of 
the whole multitude were turned upon 
him, and they durst not open their 
mouths, even one to another, and 
wist not what it meant, for they 
thought it was an angel that had ap- 
peared unto them. 

"And it came to pass that he 
stretched forth his hand and spake 
unto the people, saying, 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom 
the prophets testified shall come into 
the world; 

"And behold, I am the light and 
the life of the world; and I have drunk 
out of that bitter cup which the Father 
hath given me, and have glorified the 
Father in taking upon me the sins of 
the world, in the which I have suf- 
fered the will of the Father in all 
things from the beginning. 

"And it came to pass that when 
Jesus had spoken these words, the 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



whole multitude fell to the earth for 
they remembered that it had been 
prophesied among them that Christ 
should show himself unto them after 
his ascension into heaven. 

"And it came to pass that the Lord 
spake unto them saying, 

"Arise and come forth unto me, that 
ye may thrust your hands into my 
side, and also that ye may feel the 
prints of the nails in my hands and 
in my feet, that ye may know that I 
am the God of Israel, and the God of 
the whole earth, and have been slain 
for the sins of the world. 

"And it came to pass that the mul 
titude went forth, and thrust their 
hands into his side, and did feel the 
prints of the mails in his hands and 
in his feet; and this they did do, go- 
ing forth one by one, until they had 
all gone forth, and did see with their 
eyes, and did feel with their hands, 
and did know of a surety, and did bear 
record, that it was he of whom it 
was written by the prophets that 
should come. 

"And when they had all gone forth 
and had witnessed for themselves, 
they did cry out with one accord, say- 
ing, 

"Hosana! blessed be the name of 
the Most High God! And they did 
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did 
worship him." (Ill Nephi 11.) 

There is a record untrammeled 
and uncontaminated, revealed by 
the power of God, translated by the 
power of God, come down to us 
as a history that cannot be refuted, 
to corroborate the history that we 
may read in the Bible concerning 
this great and important, all-import- 
ant, incident and fact of the res- 
urrection from the dead, the reani- 
mation of the crucified body of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

Joseph Smith, in the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times, when 
he went to inquire of the Lord for 
knowledge and understanding, had 
the great and glorious privilege of 
a visitation from the Father and the 
Son, and again for the fourth time 



in recorded history, God bore rec- 
ord of his divine son, by his own 
voice. Three times the Lord had 
witnessed him out of heaven, but 
the fourth time he declared it in the 
presence of Joseph the prophet. On 
the banks of the Jordan, when he 
had come from the watery grave 
in newness of life, and to fulfil all 
righteousness, the voice of God 
sounded from heaven declaring, 
"This is my beloved Son, in whom 
I am well pleased." Once again on a 
high mountain in Palestine, at the 
time of the transfiguration, the 
same voice of God out of heaven 
was heard saying, "Th : s is my be- 
loved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased ; hear ye him." Again, to 
the multitude gathered about the 
temple, in the land Bountiful, on 
the western hemisphere, during 
Christ's personal appearance to the 
Nephites, God, his father, bore rec- 
ord of him in these words : "Be- 
hold my beloved Son in whom I 
am well pleased, in whom I have 
glorified my name; hear ye him." 
Then to Joseph Smith the Prophet, 
in the year 1820, in the grove at 
Palmyra, N. Y., accompanied by his 
Son Jesus Christ and both in the 
presence of the Prophet Joseph, 
God, the Father, pointing to the 
Son and addressing Joseph said, 
"This is my beloved Son, hear 
him !" 

He was resurrected, he had a 
body of flesh and bones as tangible 
as man's and so had the Father. 
So will all men have when they 
arise from the dead. The resurrec- 
tion is not the separation of the 
spirit from the body. The resurrec- 
tion is not synonymous with death. 
The resurrection is the opening of 
the graves, the calling forth of the 
dead that are in them, the giving 
up from the sea of the dead that are

in it, the re-animation of the phys- 
ical bodies, the mortal bodies of 
men that have been "sown in cor- 
ruption and raised in incorruption," 
"sown in .dishonor" and raised in 
honor and glory, sown in mortality 
and raised in immortality, "sown 
in weakness but raised in strength," 
and glorified like unto the glorious 
body of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
There is no other resurrection, no 
matter what the confessions of 
faith, of the agnostic and unbeliev- 
ing of the world may be. 

I rejoice in the truth, in the 
knowledge of the truth as it has 
been revealed to the Latter-day 
Saints in these last days. I rejoice 
that men can stand up and by the 
power of the Holy Ghost declare 
the truth as God declared it in, as 
I say, no uncertain terms, but in a 
manner that carries faith and con- 
viction and knowledge and testi- 
mony with it, even unto eternal 
life. God bless the Latter-day 
Saints, make them true and faith- 
ful. These things have been re- 
vealed once more in these the last 
days. I testify of their truth, and 
I live in the hope of the glorious 
resurrection, that I, with the faith- 
ful in Christ, may be permitted to 
come forth in the resurrection of 
the just, clothed with glory, immor- 
tality, and eternal life, and may God 
implant this faith in increasing 
ratio in my heart and in the hearts 
of all who take upon themselves 
the name of Christ the Lord, that 
we may endure faithful to the testi- 
ony to the end. Then I know that 
we shall arise again, to be exalted 
and to sit in glory in the celestial 
kingdom of our God, and praise be 
to God the Father and to Jesus 
Christ the Redeemer of the world, 
for this hope forever, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Duty of the Saints to teach the gospel 
— Because of prejudice many will 
not hear the truth from the elders 
of the Church — It is the duty of the 
.Saints to break down this prejudice 
— The appearance of the Father and 
the Son to Joseph Smith began a new 
religious .era in the world — Some 
points of difference between our be- 
lief and that of other Christians — 
A prayer that the Saints may be 
strengthened to carry the burden of 
preaching the true gospel to all na- 
tions. 

I crave an interest in your faith 
and prayers, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the time occupied by me 
may be profitable, and that the Lord 
may bless me to say something that 
will be worth remembering. It is 
often quite a difficult task for me 
to stand in the presence of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to explain the gospel, 
and I sometimes would shrink from 
the call but for the fact that I know 
that our heavenly Father inspires us 
when we put our trust in him. 

We have heard many splendid 
things in this conference and have 
rejoiced in the companionship of the 
Spirit of our heavenly Father. To- 
day, how grateful we ought to be 
at being permitted to assemble as 
we have in this comfortable build- 
ing apart from the turmoil and 
strife that exists in the world. We 
are not here as a matter of indiffer- 
ence, but because we believe in God 
the eternal Father, and in the divine 
mission of his Son Jesus Christ. 
We are here because we desire to 
be taught under the influence of the 
Spirit that comes from on high. 
There are many religious congrega- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions in the world, that assemble 
from time to time, and many beau- 
tiful truths are taught them. The 
ethics of life are enlarged upon, and 
people go away determined to live 
better lives. There is a disposition 
on the part of many of our Father's 
children to learn what he would 
have them .do, and it devolves upon 
you, my brethren and sisters, and 
your associates in this Church, to 
teach them what they ought to do. 
The world has had the Bible for 
hundreds of years, and it has been 
explained by the wisdom of men, 
but because of departing from its 
teachings and because of iniquity 
the children of men fell into dark- 
ness, and it became necessary for 
the Lord to restore his priesthood 
and authority upon the earth that 
the truth might be proclaimed in 
power. Sometimes our brethren 
and sisters of other faiths feel that 
we are egotistical in the claim we 
make. That this is the only Church 
recognized by the Lord is' our 
claim. This is our Father's work, 
and he established it. The Lord 
himself daclared to Joseph Smith 
that he was not pleased with the 
churches that existed in the world, 
in the year 1820. That does not 
mean that he was not pleased with 
the virtues of those humble people 
who went to him in prayer and de- 
sired to learn of his will, but he was 
not pleased with the man-made 
churches, and the unauthorized 
ministers who preached for doctrine 
the commandments of men. Be- 
cause of a misunderstanding, or a 
lack of understanding, of the scrip- 
tures, gradually his children were 
being led farther from the truth. 
In his own way, he preached the 
gospel to the children from the be- 
ginning, by means of Moses and 
the prophets, by means of his only 



begotten Son in the flesh. From 
generation to generation and from 
age to age, he refreshed the mem- 
ories of men and renewed unto 
them his sacred teachings through 
the servants that he appointed him- 
self. Because of the wickedness 
that existed in the earth after the 
apostles and prophets were slain, 
the minds of men were darkened. 
While they had the scriptures, they 
wrested them to their own con- 
fusion, and in many cases to their 
own loss of faith. The world was 
groping in darkness, so the Lord 
chose another servant, not a king 
nor an emperor nor a president, but 
he chose a boy, a humble young 
man not yet fifteen years of age, 
to restore to this world the knowl- 
edge that he is God, and that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that the resurrec- 
tion is a reality. 

With the thousands of mission- 
aries who have gone abroad in the 
world, with millions of tracts and 
books that have been distributed 
broadcast, teaching the truth of the 
resurrection, it is strange that so 
many of our Father's children fail 
yet to comprehend it. The adver- 
sary has used his strongest effort 
to prevent the spread of this and 
other truths of the gospel. The 
good people of the world would re- 
ceive it in their hearts if it could 
be explained to them, but because 
the adversary has vilified and ma- 
ligned and misrepresented the ser- 
vants of the Lord, the honest in 
heart all over the world are afraid 
of us and will not listen to the pure 
gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is pro- 
claimed by our missionaries. Yet, 
when it is offered to them by 
other means than an elder of Israel 
it appeals to them. It is your duty 
and mine, as bearers of the priest- 
hood, by tact and brotherly love and

faith, to overcome the prejudice 
that the adversary has sown in the 
hearts of our Father's children 
against us, to break down the ani- 
mosity that exists in some cases 
even in the minds of good men and 
good women, and teach them the 
gospel of our Lord, that it is the 
power of God unto salvation unto 
all those who believe and obey it. 
I do not become discouraged be- 
cause this truth does not find its 
way more rapidly. On the contrary 
I see in the events of today the 
hand-dealing of an allwise Father 
to prepare the way for the spread 
of the gospel that he has restored to 
the earth in our day. He has deter- 
mined that the message that was 
proclaimed by his servants in ages 
past, renewed and promulgated by 
his servants in the latter days, shall 
be heard, and by the power of his 
might he will level the conditions of 
this world and humble the children 
of men until they are repentant and 
willing to listen. The truths that 
we are teaching, that is, the truths 
that God required us to teach in the 
world, are finding their way. The 
distinction between this great 
Church and that of all other 
churches from the beginning has 
been that we believe in divine reve- 
lation; we believe that our Father 
speaks to man today as he has .done 
from the time of Adam. We be- 
lieve and we know — which is more 
than mere belief — that our Father 
has set his hand in this world for 
the salvation of the children of 
men. It is gratifying to me to find 
various denominations of the world 
accepting the truths of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ as they are por- 
trayed in the scriptures, and ex- 
plained by the gift and power of 
our heavenly Father in our day. I 
am grateful to find my Father's 



children, your brothers and sisters 
and mine, here and there, compre- 
hending the truth. When they re- 
ceive the gospel in their hearts they 
are impressed by some portion of it, 
and they are not afraid to promul- 
gate it in the world. 

In the year 1830, when this 
Church was brganized, there was 
not upon the earth a church organi- 
zation that would announce that 
they believed that God would reveal 
himself to the children of men. The 
teachings of the churches were all 
contrary to that, and our Father 
saw the futility of trying to save 
his sons and daughters until they 
could be inspired to come to him 
with the belief that he would hear 
and answer their prayers. When 
the boy prophet, in the woods of 
Palmyra, saw the Father and the 
Son, and realized that they were 
indeed personages, that they could 
hear and reply to what he said, it 
began a new era in this world, and 
laid a foundation for the faith of 
the children of men. They could 
now pray to our Father in heaven 
and realize that he could hear and 
answer their prayers, that there was 
a connection between the heavens 
and the earth. Time will not permit 
me to go into detail and point out 
that there is development even in 
the churches of the world along this 
line. I would like to digress far 
enough to say that I personally do 
not desire to be understood to be 
finding fault and criticizing the 
people who belong to the various 
denominations of the world. I am 
thankful that there are in so many 
of them good men and good women 
who believe in him and with the 
l : ght that they have serve God ; but 
the fact remains that our Father 
has established in this world, his 
Church. He has conferred upon 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men in this day his authority, and 
there is no other authority in the 
world that he will recognize but 
that which he himself has insti- 
tuted ; and when I say that, I do not 
say it in unkindness or with a feel- 
ing of harshness towards any of 
our Father's children. I, with my 
brethren of this Church, desire their 
welfare, and we have evidenced our 
desires by lives in the mission field, 
begging our bread from door to 
door, traveling without purse or 
script, living among the people, to 
share with them the glorious truth 
that our Father has made known 
unto us. While the adversary may 
inspire in some a feeling of distrust 
of us, the time will come — and that 
time, in my judgment, is not far 
off — when they will realize that this 
body of men have dedicated their 
lives to the salvation of mankind. 
Occasional changes in the creeds of 
the churches, indicate the tren.d of 
the times. I believe I will read to 
you just briefly three Articles of 
Faith, in order that you may have 
in mind what we believe that was 
different to the belief of the world. 
The principles outlined in these Ar- 
ticles were believed by us in the 
year 1830, and are as follows : 

"We believe in God the eternal 
Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, 
and in the Holy Ghost. 

"We believe all that God has re- 
vealed, all that he does now reveal, 
and we believe that he will y,et reveal 
many great and important things per- 
taining to the kingdom of God. 

"We believe in the literal gathering 
of Israel, and in the restoration of the 
Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built 
upon this continent; that Christ will 
reign personally upon the earth, and 
that the earth will be renewed and 
receive its paradisaical glory." 

That, in brief, is a portion of 
what we believe as the members of 



the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that was not be- 
lieved by the Christian world when 
this Church was organized. The 
Prophet Joseph and his brother 
Hyrum laid down their lives in Car- 
thage jail, and sealed with their 
blood, their testimony to the truth 
of the articles that I have just read, 
in connection with some of the 
others. Now, after all these years 
have gone by, we find the various 
churches adopting some of these, 
among them the Congregational 
Church in the United States. We 
find them revising their creed, and 
I call your attention to the fact that 
since 1830, practically every Chris- 
tian church has revised its creed to 
conform to the advancement of civ- 
ilization and the demands of its 
members. As far as I know the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints stands alone, having an- 
nounced its creed to the world, in 
1842, and it is in force today as 
perfectly as the day that it came 
from the pen of the Prophet. In 
the Outlook of November, 1913, is 
the following: 

"The triennial meeting of the Na- 
tional Council of Congregational 
churches in the United States, at 
Kansas City, Missouri, during the last 
week of October, was noteworthy for 
the constitutional changes it adopted, 
with a view to greater denominational 
efficiency. Since its meeting^ in 1910 
at Boston a committee of nineteen 
has been engaged in working out the 
improvements which have now been 
adopted, with but a single negative 
vote, by a body of six hundred dele- 
gates." 

Note the change in the creed in 
the year 1910. "The changes thus 
effected consist in a new confession 
of religious belief." 

Why a new confession of relig- 
ious behef ? Because they have felt 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



39 



that they have outgrown the old 
confession, and that, to my judg- 
ment, is a step in advance. Contin- 
uing : 

"The changes thus effected consist 
in a new confession of religious be- 
lief, and a new plan of church polity. 
As to the former, it is remarkable for 
'its brevity and evangelical simplicity, 
condensed, as it is, into less than two 
hundred words, strongly contrasting 
thus with the extended statement set 
forth in 1883 [when they announced 
their creed]. A close approach to it 
was made in 1906 [when they rean- 
nounced their creed], by the state- 
ment drawn up and agreed to for the 
then proposed union of the Congrega- 
tional, Methodist, Protestant and 
United Brethren churches." 

Now I call your attention to the 
fact that reference is made to the 
change of their creed and a new 
policy, in order that they may sat- 
isfy those who worsh-p in that 
great church. Why the necessity of 
change? Because the creed of the 
Congregational church, good as it 
may have been, helpful as it may 
have been to its members, was not 
the work of our heavenly Father, 
but was the work of man. That is 
the distinction between the creed of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints and all others. This 
is their creed, the new one just 
adopted, and I would like you to 
compare it, if you will, with the 
Articles of Faith of our Church that 
I have read to you already. Con- 
tinuing : 

"We believe in God the Father, in- 
finite in wisdom, goodness and love, 
and in Jesus Christ his Son, our Lord 
and Savior, who, for us and our salva- 
tion, lived and died, rose again, and 
liveth evermore." 

Now, that is very much, it seems 
to me, in substance, what the 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints has been teaching from 
the beginning. 

"And in the Holy Spirit who taketh 
of the things of Christ and revealeth 
them to us, renewing, comforting and 
inspiring the souls of men. We are 
united in striving to know the will of 
God as taught in the holy scriptures, 
and in our purpose to walk in the 
ways of the Lord, made known or to 
be made known to us." 

Is that not a plain and distinct 
announcement of a belief in revela- 
tion, in that God will make known 
his will to the children of men — the 
very thing that differentiates this 
Church, and has done from the be- 
ginning, from all the organizations 
of the world? 

"We hold it to be the mission of 
the Church of Christ to proclaim the 
gospel to all mankind, exalting for 
worship the one true God, and 
laboring for the progress ,of knowl- 
edge and promotion of justice, the 
triumph of peace, and the realization 
of human brotherhood. Depending, 
as did our fathers, upon the continued 
guidance of the Holy Spirit to lead 
us into all truth. We work and pray 
for the transformation of the world 
into the kingdom of God, and we look 
with faith for the triumph of right- 
eousness and for life and glory ever- 
lasting. Amein." 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
that another great organization has 
taken a step forward and is willing 
to announce its belief in the ability 
and power of God to teach his chil- 
dren upon the earth. I am grateful 
for this announcement, and for 
many others that have been made 
in the last few years, that time will 
not permit me to refer to this 
morning. 

I am thankful for the blessing of 
our Father that has been extended 
to the Latter-dav Saints, that we 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have received the truth, and I do 
not feel that we are egotistical, or 
feel that we have been chosen above 
our fellows, but rather that with the 
blessing that has come to us the 
Lord has placed upon us the re- 
sponsibility, that we must go into 
all the world and preach the gospel 
unto every creature, before the end 
shall come. 

May the Lord strengthen our 
backs for the burden. May he in- 
spire us to righteous living that will 
increase our faith and strengthen 
us for the work we have to do. May 
he give our brethren and sisters of 
this world an understanding of our 
purpose, that they may realize thai 
it is with genuine love and devotion 
that we strive to extend the glorious 
message of life and salvation to 
them. I know that this is our 
Father's work. I know that it is 
the power of God unto salvation ; 
and, standing as I do in your pres- 
ence, and in the presence of the 
Lord, expecting in the not far dis- 
tant future to give an account to 
him for the time that I have lived 
in the world, I bear my testimony 
to the divine mission of the Savior, 
and to that of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The first requisite in a servant of 
God — The Book of Abraham — Truth 
sneaks for itself — The willing and 
the unwilling — Optimism versus 
pessimism — Duties of the Twelve 
Apostles — Their spirit and attitude. 

"I'll go where you want me to go, 
dear Lord, 
Over mountain or plain or sea, 
I'll say what you want me to say, 
dear Lord, 
T'll be what you want me to be." 

This little verse embodies, to my 
mind, the true spirit of a Latter- 



day Saint, the spirit that should 
actuate every man and woman in 
the Church of God. It is the spirit 
of the gospel, whose divine Author 
came not to do his own will, but the 
will of the Father who sent him. 
I used to think that the first re- 
quisite in a servant of the Lord — 
say a bishop, was that he be an 
able business man, and I still believe 
business ability to be a very valua- 
ble asset in a bishop of this Church. 
But I have learned that it is not the 
first requisite. The first requisite 
in a bishop always has been and 
always will be, that he manifest a 
willingness to serve God. I used to 
think that the first requisite in an 
apostle was that he be a preacher 
and a writer, and that he go some- 
where ; but I have also revised my 
opinion upon that point. The first 
requisite in an apostle is that he 
shall be a willing worker for God, 
to go where he is sent, to stay 
where he is put, to say what the 
Lord wants him to say, to be what 
the Lord wants him to be, to go and 
come as directed by proper author- 
ity, and do whatever the Lord re- 
quires at his hands. This is the 
spirit that should animate and in- 
spire every member of the Church 
of Christ. 

One of the main purposes for 
which man was placed upon the 
earth was to demonstrate whether 
or not he would do all things that 
the Lord required of him. In con- 
firmation of this statement I will 
read you a passage of scripture, one 
of the most comprehensive to be 
found in any of the sacred writings, 
ancient or modern : 

"Now the Lord had shown unto me, 

Abraham, the intelligences that were 

organized before the world was; and 

among all these there were many of 

the noble and great ones; 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



41 



"And God saw these souls that they 
were good, and he stood in the midst 
of them, and he said: These I will 
make my rulers; for he stood among 
those that were spirits, and he saw 
that they were good; and he said unto 
me: Abraham, thou art one of them; 
thou wast chosen before thou wast 
born. 

"And there stood one among them 
that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him: We 
will go down, for there is space there, 
and we will take of these materials, 
and we will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell; 

"And we will prove them herewith, 
to see if they will do all things what- 
soever the Lord their God shall com- 
mand them; 

"And they who keep their first es- 
tate shall be added upon; and they 
who keep not their first estate shall 
■not have glory in the same kingdom 
with those who keep their first estate; 
and they who keep their second estate 
shall have glory added upon their 
heads forever and ever." 

The passage I have read is from 
the Book of Abraham, translated by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith from 
papyrus found upon mummies ex- 
humed from the catacombs of 
Egypt. This book was made the 
object of a rather fierce polemic at- 
tack a few years since, its authen- 
ticity being questioned by a schol- 
arly gentlemen who then resided 
among us. His strictures were re- 
plied to by quite a number of our 
brethren, and the replies were pub- 
lished in the daily press. 

Subsequently I conversed with 
this gentleman, and he asked me 
why I had not replied to him. I 
told him that I had been replying 
to him all over the country where 
I had been traveling, but that my 
reply had not happened to get into 
the papers. "Oh, indeed," said he, 
"and what have you been saying?" 
"I have been saying this, in sub- 
stance : That it matters not where 



truth is found, whether ,in the cata- 
combs of Egypt, or in the mounds 
of North America; whether it 
comes through the lips of an an- 
cient sage or a modern seer ; that 
it matters not who translates it, or 
how many imperfections the trans- 
lation may show; that truth is 
truth ; and that the best criterion of 
judgment when the authenticity of 
any literary work is passed upon, 
is the spirit and character of its 
teachings." Said he : "I agree with 
you; that is the best standard by 
which to judge the authenticity of 
such a work." "Then," I affirmed, 
"the Book of Abraham needs no 
defense. It speaks for itself. It 
manifests its own divinity ; for no 
one but God could have delivered 
such splendid teachings in such a 
majestic and sublime spirit as this 
book contains." 

There is something in every 
great author that stamps itself upon 
his writings and renders them 
peculiar, or characteristic of him- 
self. There is a Shakesperean ring 
to Shakespeare's writings ; there is 
a Byronic ring to Lord Byron's 
poetry ; and a Miltonic ring to the 
productions of Milton; and any 
literary expert can distinguish be- 
tween them. Many poets have de- 
scribed the sunrise, but when one of 
them says: 

"Night's candles are burned out, and 

jocund day 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain 

tops," 

we know that Shakespeare has 
spoken ; and no other poet could 
have worded it in just that way. 
Another calls upon God for inspira- 
tion, 

"That to the height of this great ar- 
gument 
I may assert eternal providence, 
And justify the ways of God to men." 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The lines are Milton's, and the style 
is peculiar to that mighty son of 
song. It is the same with all great 
writers. The creation testifies of 
the creator. Is it. surprising, then, 
that when God speaks there should 
be some distinguishing feature to 
characterize the utterance and make 
it different from any utterance of 
mortal man? There is a spirit, an 
indescribable quality, a divine pow- 
er in the word of God that cannot 
be successfully counterfeited. Men 
have tried to counterfeit it, but have 
failed ignominiously. 

In the early days of this Church 
certain of its members who thought 
they had made the Prophet Joseph, 
because they had had a little more 
schooling than he, presumed to sit 
in judgment upon the revelations 
that he had received from the Lord 
Jesus Christ. The Lord, by the 
Prophet, told them the thoughts of 
their hearts in these searching 
words : 

"Your eyes have been upon my 
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his 
language you have known, and his 
imperfections you have known; and 
you have sought in your hearts knowl- 
edge that you might express beyond 
his language, this you also know; 

"Now seek ye out of the Book of 
Commandments, even tlie least tha: 
is among them, and appoint him that 
is the most wise among you; 

"Or, if there be any among you, 
that shall make one like unto it, then 
ye are justified in saying that you do 
not know that they are true; 

"But if you cannot make one like 
unto it, ye are under condemnation 
if ye do not bear record that they are 
true." — Doctrine and Covenants, 67: 
5-8. 

Well, one of them, who thought 
himself the wisest, and who pos- 
sessed some learning-, took up the 
challenge and actually attempted to 
frame a revelation; but it was a 



flat failure. He could utter, of 
course, certain words, and roll out 
a mass of rhetoric ; but the divine 
spirit was lacking, and he had to 
acknowledge himself beaten. 

It is not so easy to put the spirit 
of life into things. Man can make 
the body, but God alone can create 
the spirit. You have heard, have 
you not, of the scientist who took 
a grain of wheat and endeavored to 
make one just like it? First he 
separated the grain of wheat into 
its component parts, and found that 
it contained so much lime, so much 
silica, so much of this element and 
that; and then he took other parts 
corresponding thereto, brought 
them together by means of his 
chemical skill, and produced a grain 
of wheat so exactly similar to the 
other that the natural eye could not 
detect any difference between them. 
But there was a difference, a vast 
difference, and it was demonstrated 
when he planted the two grains. 
The one that God made sprang up, 
and the one that man made stayed 
down. Why? Because the man- 
made grain of wheat had no spirit 
— only a body, and the body with- 
out the spirit is dead. Man cannot 
breathe into the body of things the 
breath of life ; that is a function 
and prerogative of Deity. It is not 
so easy to frame revelations from 
God. A vain boaster making ridi- 
cule of the proverbs of Solomon, 
said : "Anybody can make 
proverbs." His friend answered, 
"Try a few," and the conversation 
ended. 

Back now to the subject of will- 
ingness, referred to in the Book of 
Abraham. I repeat that willingness 
to serve God is manifestly the first 
and prime requisite of a Latter-day 
Saint. 

Some wit has declared that the

automobile is fast resolving the hu- 
man race into two great classes — 
"the quick and the dead" (Laugh- 
ter). But long before the automo- 
bile was thought of there was an 
influence at work dividing the sheep 
from the goats, separating human- 
ity into two grand divisions — those 
willing to do right, and those de- 
termined to do wrong. Even in the 
Church of God this spirit is mani- 
fest. The gospel makes us will- 
ing to do anything that the Lord 
requires; and that spirit can be 
trusted. When we are dominated 
by the opposite influence, it is a 
sure sign that we are skating where 
the ice is thin, and we had better 
get over to the other side of the 
pond. The spirit of the gospel is 
optimistic ; it trusts in God and 
looks on the bright side of things. 
The opposite or pessimistic spirit 
drags men down and away from 
God, looks on the dark side, mur- 
murs, complains, and is slow to 
yield obedience. There is a story 
told of two buckets that hung in a 
well, on either end of a long chain, 
so that when one went up the other 
went down, and vice versa. They 
were both drawing water out of 
the well, both doing precisely the 
same kind of work, but one of the 
buckets was an optimist, and the 
other was a pessimist. The pessim- 
istic bucket complained of its lot, 
saying : "It doesn't matter how full 
I come up, I always go back 
empty." The optimistic bucket, 
with a bright smile, retorted : "It 
doesn't matter how empty I go 
down, I always come back full" 
(Laughter). Much depends, you 
see, upon the spirit in which a thing- 
is viewed. 

If I have achieved anything in 
the whole course of my life that is 
worthy to be called success, it is 



because I have been willing to do 
the things required of me by right- 
ful authority. Not always have I 
done them perfectly — I admit that 
freely; but God has been merciful 
to me, and in spite of my faults I 
have done enough to show him that 
I was at least willing to do what he 
required, and a certain measure of 
success has followed. When called 
upon my first mission, I had had 
little religious experience, but I 
possessed that first requisite in a 
servant of God — I was willing to 
go ; and when I returned and was 
asked to serve as a block teacher, I 
was willing to so serve. A few 
weeks later I became the bishop of 
the ward — not because I wanted to 
be, but because the Lord wanted me 
to be, and I was willing to respond 
to the call made upon me. I was a 
ward bishop for nearly twenty- 
eight years ; and the highest com- 
pliment I ever received from our 
beloved President Joseph F. Smith, 
and about the only one, as a bishop, 
was when he told the people of my 
ward that there must be something 
to a man when they could "stomach 
him" for twenty-eight years as 
their bishop (Laughter). Well, 
they "stomached" me because they 
had to ; for I was there to stay 
until wanted elsewhere. I never 
thought I had the right to resign 
my bishopric any more than I had 
the right to release myself from my 
mission. My mother wrote to me 
saying: "Why don't you come 
home? All the missionaries have 
returned that went when you did, 
all but yourself. Why don't you 
come?" I answered: "Because I 
have not been released, and I will 
stay till I am released, if it be ten 
years or more. I will never ask 
for a release, will never return till 
the servants of God say, 'It is

enough ; come home.' " And I 
meant it. 

I have much enjoyed my labors 
as an apostle. I did not seek this 
exalted station, but was willing to 
accept the call when it came ; 
and I stand here today ready to do 
anything that the Lord requires of 
me. I have never promised to do 
everything that man wants me to 
do ; but that is not the divine re- 
quirement. We are here that it may 
be seen whether we will do all that 
the Lord requires at our hands. I 
am ready to do that, and my breth- 
ren are also ready. 

There is a great deal of talk in- 
dulged in about the duties of the 
Council of the Twelve. Some peo- 
ple think that we should be always 
"on the go." Well, we are pretty 
much "on the go," all the time. As 
President Lyman was wont to re- 
mark, in his humorous way, "We 
are somewhere every Sunday." But 
the trouble is that we don't go far 
enough away to suit some people. 
It reminds me of that story told 
by Mark Twain about the governor 
of Nevada in early clays. The gov- 
ernor's relatives flocked to him in 
large numbers, and as he had noth- 
ing for them to do and wanted to 
be rid of them, he set them to work 
surveying a railroad "to a certain 
point east." They went out survey- 
ing, and the first night came back to 
the point from which they started. 
They did likewise the second night, 
and the third. But after that they 
were too far away to return at 
night, and becoming anxious sent 
back word, "How far do you want 
this railroad to go ?" The governor 
replied: "To the Atlantic ocean, 
blast you, and then bridge it and 
goon" (Laughter). That message 
brought the whole gang back again. 

Even people outside the Church 



are sometimes worried lest our 
apostles should not be going some- 
where all the time. Two years ago 
last summer I found myself in Kirt- 
land, Ohio, once the headquarters 
of the Church, the birthplace of my 
father, and the place where my 
grandparents received the gospel. 
Ohio was also one of the states 
where I labored during my first 
mission. The Kirtland temple is in 
the possession of what is known as 
the Reorganized Church, and a 
young man from West Virginia 
had charge of the building when 
I was last there. He was a recent 
convert to their faith, a part of 
which is that "the Utah Church," 
as they call us, is in an apostate 
condition. He was full of informa- 
tion and an overweening desire to 
impart it. Not knowing who I was 
or where I was from, he began 
upon me, saying: "One of the dis- 
tinctive features between our 
church and the Utah Church is that 
our apostles are always out in the 
field, while their apostles are always 
at home." I knew I had him 
(Laughter). I answered : "Is that 
so? Why, I am just from Utah, 
and I happen to know that Hyrum 
M. Smith, one of the apostles of 
the Utah Church, as you call it, is 
now at Liverpool, presiding over 
the European mission ; and I hap- 
pen to know that Reed Smoot, an- 
other of their apostles, is at Wash- 
ington, D. C, a member of the 
United States Senate ; and I happen 
to know that still another, namely, 
your humble servant, is here talking 
to you in the state of Ohio." "Oh," 
said he, and changed the subject 
(Laughter). 

Brethren and sisters, I bear my 
testimony that the members of the 
Council of the Twelve are just as 
ready today as they ever were to go 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

where they are sent. But they .do 
not travel to and fro on their own 
account, independently of the au- 
thority above them ; and they do 
not take their instructions from 
every Tom, Dick and Harry who 
thinks he understands their duties 
better than they do themselves. 
They are ready to go and come 
under the direction of the First 
Presidency of the Church — God's 
servants, the only ones .empowered 
to direct their labors. In conclu- 
sion let me read to you a little par- 
aphrase of my own upon the beau- 
tiful verse that I quoted at the be- 
ginning. This expresses my spirit, 
my attitude, and the spirit and atti- 
tude of my brethren : 

"I'll go where you want me to go, 
dear Lord, 
I'll go whenever you say; 
But till I am sent, I'm .not going 
to go, 
I'll stay where you want me to 
stay." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I hope you will pardon me for 
expressing a single thought. It is 
well understood that there are in 
the world two great principles or 
powers, and these two are opposed 
to each other. One is the principle 
or power of truth ; the other is that 
of error and ignorance, which is 
evil. That is, God's truth and its 
adversary. It is too true often that 
the adversary of truth has been 
compelled to adopt or mix a little 
of God's truth with his errors and 
heresies, in order to better prevail 
over the whole truth, and more ef- 
fectively to defeat it. These ap- 
parent improvements on the part 
of error are no great evidences of 
concurrence in the purposes of 
God ; and we should not forget it ! 



The choir and congregation 
sang : "We thank thee, O God, for 
a prophet." 

Elder William J. Kuhre, pres- 
ident of the Jordan stake of Zion, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The conference was called to 
order at 2 o'clock p. m. by Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith who presided. 

The Juab stake choir, under di- 
rection of Carl Nelson, sang: "Let 
the mountains shout for joy." 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Richard W. Young, pres- 
ident of the Ensign stake of Zion. 

The Juab stake choir sang the 
anthem, "Praise the Lord." 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

If I were to express my present 
wish and feeling, I would say, the 
Lord bless the Juab stake choir. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY. 

God is Love — He is not causing the 
misery of the war-torn world; dis- 
obedience to his laws lies at the 
root of the misery — It is God's de- 
sire to bring to pass the immortal- 
ity and eternal life of man — Man, 
with his free agency, must choose 
his own course, and the results of 
his follies cannot be charged to our 
loving Father — He would have men 
and nations choose the right, and 
not the wrong path. Indulgence in 
strong drink is destructive of man- 
hood — When the nations wanted ef- 
ficiency they were compelled to 
abandon drink and thus to obey a 
commandVnent of God — ^^Compari-

intemperance — The hand of God in 
the rise and fall of nations, the 
whole pointing to the preaching of 
the peaceful gospel of Christ to all 
the world — Our obligations to bear 
the message of the Love of God to 
all mankind. 

As I came to conference this af- 
ternoon, one of the presidents of 
stakes accosted me, saying : "Well, 
are your nerves shattered because 
of the war?" I answered, "No, not 
because of the war, but they are 
pretty well unstrung at the thoughts 
of having to speak this afternoon," 
and that is a fact. 

I seldom, if ever, approach this 
duty of standing before an audience 
without a feeling of timidity; and I 
sincerely pray that the Spirit of the 
Lord will remove that feeling from 
me now as it has on other occa- 
sions. I desire to keep in harmony 
with his Spirit, and with the spirit 
of this most excellent conference. 
I testify that we have received the 
word of the Lord, and I am sure 
that all of those who have been in 
attendance at these meetings will 
bear the same testimony. I rejoice 
in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
rejoice in the faith and assurance I 
have that God is guiding this peo- 
ple, and that he will over-rule the 
destinies of nations so that the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ may be preached 
in all the world as a witness before 
the end shall come. 

John, the beloved disciple, once 
wrote, as we find in first John, 
4th chapter and 16th verse, "He 
that loveth not knoweth not God, 
for Go'd is love," and, in harmony 
with this truth, the poet sings: 

'Earth with her ten thousand flowers. 
Air with all its beams and showers, 
Heavens infinite expanse, 
Sea's resplendent countenance, 
A.11 around and all above, 
Bear this record, God is love." 



I am not one of those who see in 
this world catastrophe the hand of 
God as its cause. I do not believe 
that God has caused the misery, the 
famine, the pestilence, and the death 
that are now sweeping the war-torn 
countries of Europe. I do believe 
that the conditions of the world to- 
day are a direct result— an inevit- 
able result, of disobedience to God's 
laws. I was surprised to read re- 
cently, in a current magazine, the 
expression that came from a school 
of free thinkers in London. Prom- 
inent men in that city were discuss- 
ing the problem as to the effect that 
this world-war would have upon 
Christianity. One of those men re- 
corded his views as follows : 

"Never have the souls of men 
been more sorely tried than at pres- 
ent. Across Europe rolls the roar 
of guns. Peaceful villages burst 
into flames. Ships of death sail the 
midnight sky and rain murder on 
the innocent. At every moment 
brave men are slain. Under the 
weight of overwhelming calamity 
the world staggers and groans. 
Was this all designed before the 
foundations of the earth were laid?" 
Then he asks : 

"How then can one worship the 
designer? Is it a by-product, and 
undesigned and unexpected result 
of creative power? How then can 
omnipotence exist? Does not the 
state of Europe make the belief in 
God a superstition? In the shadow 
of the immense disaster the figure 
of the living Father recedes into 
dim and formless outlines. Trust 
in his care grows faint and feeble. 
Human tears blur the vision of 
eternal bliss as human love has 
quenched the fires of hell." 

Such men, certainly, have lost 
the vision of the Creator as be- 
ing a God of love. In answer to 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



47 



this gentleman, I cannot but repeat 
the words of the Redeemer : "Ye 
do err, not understanding the scrip- 
tures." I think, too, the words of 
Shakespeare are appropriate in 
which he said : 

"This is the excellent foppery of 
the world, that when we are sick in 
fortune, — often the surfeit of our 
own behavior, — we make guilty of 
our disasters the sun, the moon, and 
the stars ; as if we were villians by 
necessity; fools by heavenly com- 
pulsion ; * * * and all that we 
are evil in, by a divine thrusting 
on." 

I believe that God is love, that 
he is our Father and desires the 
happiness and eternal life of his 
children. Indeed, this is his glory, 
"to bring to pass the immortality 
and eternal life of man." He has 
placed man upon earth and, as he 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph, as 
recorded, in the 19th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, "he gave 
to man that he might be an agent 
unto himself." Men may choose 
the right or they may choose the 
wrong ; they may walk in darkness 
or they may walk in the light ; and, 
mind you, God has not left his chil- 
dren without the light. He has 
given them in the various dispensa- 
tions of the world the light of the 
gospel wherein they could walk and 
not stumble, wherein they could find 
that peace and happiness which he 
desires, as a loving Father, his chil- 
dren should enjoy, but the Lord 
does not take from them their free 
agency. The Prophet Lehi, in 
speaking to his son Jacob, bears 
testimony to that truth in unmis- 
takable terms. He ^ays : "Where- 
fore, the Lord God gave unto man 
that he should act for himself. 
Wherefore, man could not act for 
himself save it should be that he was 



enticed by the one or the other." 
And then, in the 27th verse : "Where- 
fore, men are free according to the 
flesh, and all things are given them 
which are expedient unto man, and 
they are free to choose liberty and 
eternal life through the great medi- 
ation of all men, or to choose 
iniquity, and death according to 
the captivity and power of the devil, 
for he seeketh that all men might 
be miserable like unto himself." 

God is watching over the destinv 
of nations. Someone has said, 
"there is a divinity that shapes our 
ends, rough-hew them as we may." 
We may "rough-hew our ends," 
we choose our course, but God will 
overrule our acts and the acts of na- 
tions for the consummation of his 
divine purposes. If what that free 
thinker in London says were true, 
that God designed all this misery to 
come upon the nations, we should 
read the maxim, just quoted in this 
way: "There is a divinity that 
shapes our ends rough — hew them 
as we may." 

God is standing in the shadow of 
eternity, it seems to me, deploring 
now the inevitable results of the 
follies, the transgressions and the 
sins of his wayward children, but 
we cannot blame him for these any 
more than we can blame a father 
who might say to his son, "There 
are two roads, my son, one leading 
to the right, one leading to the 
left. If you take the one to the 
right it will lead you to success and 
to happiness. If you take the one 
to the left it will bring upon you 
misery and unhappiness and per- 
haps death, but you choose which 
you will. You must choose ; I will 
not force either upon you." The 
young man starts out and, seeing 
the allurements and the attractive 
ness of the road to the left, and 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thinking it a short cut to his happi- 
ness, he concludes to take it. The 
father knows what will become of 
him, he knows that not far from 
that flowery path there is a mire 
hole into which his boy will fall, he 
knows that after he struggles out 
of that mire hole he will come to a 
slough into which he will flounder. 
He sees others who have chosen 
that path in that same slough, and 
he knows that in their struggle to 
get on dry land there will be fight- 
ing. He could see it long before 
the boy reached that condition, and 
he could, therefore, foretell it. The 
father loves the boy just the same, 
and would still continue to warn 
him, and plead for him to return to 
the right path. God, too, has shown 
the world, through his prophets in 
ages gone by, that many of his peo- 
ple, individuals, as well as nations, 
would choose the path that leads to 
misery and to death, and he fore- 
told it, but the responsibility is 
upon those who would not heed 
God's message, not upon God. But 
in his infinite wisdom, he will over- 
rule these transgressions for the 
good of all his sons and daughters. 
His love for them is already mani- 
fest, for great as is the destruction 
that is now sweeping the world, 
greater will be the good that will 
come out of it through God's love 
for his chlidren. When, for exam- 
ple, these nations, prompted by bit- 
terness, some of them, selfishness, 
enmity, fear or other feelings con- 
trary to the spirit of the gospel and 
the spirit of love, began to grapple 
each other's throats, they could see 
that to succeed they needed the 
highest efficiency of the manhood of 
the country, so what did they do ? 
Russia forbade her people to drink 
vodka, France prohibited the use 
of absinthe. England, Italy and 



other nations restricted their people 
in the use of intoxicants, thus testi- 
fying to the world that indulgence 
in strong drink is destructive of the 
manhood of a nation. It matters 
not, as far as the lesson is con- 
cerned, whether after the war those 
nations again throw down the bars, 
the testimony to the world is al- 
ready given. When they needed 
young manhood at its highest effi- 
ciency they had to accept one of the 
commandments of the Lord as he 
revealed it. They do not call it that, 
but you know what it is, and the 
world will never forget after this, 
that we need efficiency of manhood 
in times of peace just as much as we 
need it in times of war. It is my 
opinion, however, that they will 
never go back to it, never. Thus, 
in this one great thing of temper- 
ance, a great blessing will come to 
the world. Suppose, as it is esti- 
mated, that perhaps an average of 
fifteen hundred men die on the bat- 
tle field every day, and will con- 
tinue to die at that rate until the 
war is over. Half a million men a 
year, not counting those who are 
missing and who are wounded — it 
is a terrible loss. But do you know 
that in America alone the violation 
of God's law by indulgence in 
strong drink is rushing to a prema- 
ture death over two thousand every 
day? It is estimated that every 
year in America alone more men 
are sent to a premature death by 
alcohol than have been killed on 
the fields of battle for the last two 
thousand years. At a convention 
of insurance men held recently, men 
said that through the prohibition of 
vodka in Russia alone, that nation 
is saving fifty thousand men an- 
nually. Can anyone, in view of 
that, stand aside and not see the 
hand of God working? 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

Another thing. The other day, 
almost within twenty-four hours, 
the shackles of dynasty were torn 
from the limbs of Russia, and mil- 
lions of people set free. One hun- 
dred thousand prisoners are now 
either at home, or are marching 
over the snows of Siberia back to 
their homes and freedom ; and it 
looks as if Russia will have a gov- 
ernment "by the people, of the peo- 
ple, and for the people." Many 
years ago the Lord said to the 
prophet, speaking of America : 
"No king shall ever rule this land." 
It was the land of the free ; and it 
has become an ensign to the whole 
world. In this land was first re- 
vealed in this dispensation, the gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. As thrones 
topple and monarchies crumble, 
you will see that the people who 
are given their free agency will 
begin to appreciate the principles 
of self-government, preparatory to 
their accepting the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, which is the perfect law of 
liberty. I can see in all this a step 
toward a truer brotherhood — a 
preparation for the millennium. 
It may yet be far in the future, no 
one knows, but I can see Divine in- 
fluence over-ruling the destiny of 
nations, at least preparatory to the 
preaching of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

One of our poets sees the same 
thing, and writes : 

"Oh, Lord, God of Hosts, whose hand 
Dominion holds on sea and land, 
In peace and war thy will we see, 
Shaping the cause of liberty. 
Nations may rise and nations fall, 
Thy changeless purpose shapes them 
all." 

In conclusion, fellow workers, 
men holding the priesthood of God, 
what is the responsibility resting 



upon us as God's servants? Oh, 
how happy we should be that we 
are living in this land, the best in 
all the world, — this nation, the most 
glorious, guided by the constitution, 
inspired by God. Thankful? Why. 
that fact alone ought to make ev- 
ery American bow down and thank 
his God for the blessing of liberty 
that he enjoys. In addition to that, 
however, you and I have the great- 
est blessing that can come to man — 
membership in the Church of Christ 
and a testimony that God lives and 
that he loves his children. If we 
do appreciate it, I think we cannot 
shun the responsibility or fail to 
sense the responsibility that rests 
upon us to bear that same message 
to the suffering people in the world. 
People in distress are going to look 
for liberty, they are going to look 
for succor. Not all men and wom- 
en in those war-torn countries are 
going to say that God is not om- 
nipotent. Only a few of the skep- 
tics who do not know God and who 
are struggling in blindness can 
draw that conclusion. The honest 
millions are going to look for re- 
lief ; and you, my fellow workers, 
must give that message which will 
lead them to peace, happiness and 
salvation. Only a few thousand 
may have the privilege of bearing 
that testimony abroad, but all the 
membership of the Church will have 
the opportunity to live in obedience 
to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
show that they are using their free- 
dom, and their free agency in tread- 
ing the path that leads to life eter- 
nal. We can do this by the observ- 
ance of a thousand little things, es- 
pecially by keeping our lives pure 
and unspotted from the sins of the 
world. Refrain from speaking ill 
of our neighbors, of creating con- 
tention, and of stirring up strife.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The responsibility and opportunity 
comes to us to be an example to all 
the world. God help us so to be, 
that in thus conducting ourselves 
the Church may be an ensign to 
the nations, such as will indeed be 
a guide to them as they try to get 
back into the presence of their God, 
whom they will recognize, some 
day, as a God of love and not one 
of destruction and hate. In the 
words of the poet, let us pray: 

"For those who minister and heal 
And spend themselves, their skill, 

their zeal, 
Renew their hearts with Christ-like 

faith, 
And guard them from disease and 

death; 
And in thine own good time, Lord, 

send 
Thy peace on earth 'til time shall 
end." 

May the Lord grant this to his 
people, with his Holy Spirit to guide 
them, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Members of the Juab stake choir 
sang a trio : "To thee, O Father." 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

The definite and unchangeable pur- 
poses of God to be accomplished — 
Priestcraft and the divine right of 
kings to be stricken down and the 
civil and religious liberty of all men 
to be recognized — The uniting of 
the sturdy and intelligent peasantry 
of many nations, in America, the 
land of destiny, a beginning to help 
bring about this purpose — The es- 
tablishment of the true and world- 
wide Church of Christ in America, 
having the greatest moral code .ever 
known, also a contributory means to 
this end — America has thus a Gov-

Civil and Church truths applied to 
the great issue before the world to-

the rivers to the ends of the earth. 

"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
and are heavy laden and I will give 
you rest." 

Since this conference commenced, 
as I have listened to the remarks 
made, I have been thinking of these 
words of the Redeemer, and ap- 
plying them to the past, present and 
future, as they are related to the 
country in which we live, the gov- 
ernment to which we profess alle- 
giance and service, and the Church 
to which the great majority of us

The foundation of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
as has been repeatedly stated at this 
conference, is laid in God the 
Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and 
the Holy Ghost. The Church rec- 
ognizes God as the creator of the 
universe, and that he dominates, 
governs and controls the destiny 
of all nations. It is not a doctrine 
of the Church, as has been stated 
by Brother McKay, that all of the 
events which have signalized the 
history of the world, the rise and 
fall of nations, the war, the blood- 
shed and devastation which have 
occurred, have been by God's de- 
cree, or with his approval, but 
rather that man, because of 
transgression and disobedience has 
brought these great judgments upon 
his own head. We do believe, how- 
ever, that God has had, and now has 
foreknowledge of all that has oc- 
curred among the nations of the 
world from the beginning, that 
which is now occurring, and which 
will occur in the future. That he 
has certain definite and unchange-

able purposes to be accomplished 
among his children, which the 
power of neither men nor devils 
can stay, and that, from time to 
time, he has revealed to his servants 
the prophets, and does now reveal 
to them, his purposes as they apply 
to the inhabitants of the earth. 

At the close of the fifteenth cen- 
tury the then known world was 
growing old, as man counts time. 
Chaldea, Egypt, Babylonia, Greece 
and Rome, each with a civilization 
which it had been thought would 
always endure, had flourished and 
passed into history, leaving only 
magnificent ruins to testify of their 
greatness. The great kingdom of 
Israel, the chosen people of the 
Lord, had been scattered to the 
four winds of heaven. A multitude 
of nations had come out from these 
kingdoms, each burdened with the 
memories, traditions and errors of 
the past, in both civil and religious 
life. 

The doctrine of the divine right 
of kings had been securely estab- 
lished ; the doctrine that some men 
were born to serve, and others to 
receive service, was accepted with- 
out protest, the gospel of the Re- 
deemer had been so changed that it 
was not recognizable. The time 
had come for the emancipation of 
the human family, when they were 
to be liberated from the thraldom of 
ages, in both civil and religious life. 

This could only be accomplished 
in a new world, under primitive 
conditions, 'in a world and among 
a people whose vision was not ob- 
scured by the moss and rust of ages, 
and so the Spirit of the Lord 
wrought upon a man among the na- 
tions of the Gentiles, and he de- 
clared that, if permitted, he could 
sail out upon the great unknown 
ocean and find a new world. Wise 



men shook their heads in doubt, the 
ignorant tapped their foreheads, as 
he passed and said, "pobre-cito, esta 
loco," "poor fellow, he is crazy," he 
thinks that by sailing away to the 
west he can circumnavigate the 
globe, and return home without 
turning round to come back; but 
the man persisted, and when men 
refused to listen, under the patron- 
age of a woman, he sailed away 
from Spain, and landed on the 
shores of the new world. 

The beginning of the end, so far 
as old conditions were concerned, 
had dawned. Kingcraft and priest- 
craft were to be stricken down, the 
liberty of all men recognized that 
Christ's kingdom was to be estab- 
l : shed among men, and his will done 
upon earth as it is done in heaven. 

For the accomplishment of this 
great purpose there came to the new 
world, not people of a single race, 
speaking one language, to establish 
here the ideals and race prejudices 
of their old homes, but a community 
of men adapted, because of their 
cosmopolitan character, to evolve 
the great nation which this was de- 
signed of the Lord to be. 

To the devotion and faith of the 
Puritan of New England came the 
integrity and sturdy patriotism of 
the Dutch from New York, the 
dash and gallantry of the Cavalier 
from Virginia, and the light-hearted 
energy of the French from Louis- 
iana, a combination of tempera- 
ments never before brought togeth- 
er, and calculated to produce the 
great composite American of today. 

It was under such circumstances, 
by such men, that the foundation of 
our government was laid. For the 
first time, at least in modern times, 
the declaration was made to the 
world that all men were created 
with cerain inherent rights. All

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men. Not all Englishmen, nor 
Dutchmen, nor Frenchmen, but men 
of all nations. That they were en- 
titled to certain rights and privileges 
which could not in justice he taken 
from them : the right to pursue 
the avocations of life, to possess 
property and pursue happiness, 
without molestation, so long as they 
did not infringe upon the rights of 
others. They made another start- 
ling declaration, they had the ef- 
frontery to say that all governments 
derive their just powers from the 
consent of the governed. The day 
that declaration was made, the 
death knell of every crowned tyrant 
in the world was sounded. 

They did another thing, this 
heterogeneous body of men, whom 
the old world called a mob; they 
said to the oppressed of all nations, 
come unto us, all you who labor and 
are heavey laden and we will give 
you rest. And they came. Not 
kings and princes, not many dukes 
and counts and barons, but the stur- 
dy and intelligent peasantry of the 
world came, and here under the 
Stars and Stripes they have found 
rest, until today one city of our 
land has more Jews than can be 
found in all Palestine, the strength 
and intelligence of Ireland is here, 
liberty loving men from all nations 
have come to these United States, 
and here they have found rest. They 
love this country because it is theirs, 
because it belongs to no particular 
race or people, because it is not a 
country of men of American birth, 
not a country of Englishmen, nor 
Dutchmen, nor Frenchmen, nor 
Germans, but a country of Amer- 
icans, where every man who is loyal 
to its institutions, stands equal with 
every other man before the law. 

The time had come for the ac- 
complishment of another great pur- 



pose, indispensable to the welfare 
of mankind, and as clearly foreor- 
dained of God, and designed in his 
economy for the redemption of the 
world, as any event which has oc- 
curred in its history. The errors and 
injustice of civil government, which 
had crept into the systems of the 
old world, were not more marked 
than those which had come into 
the : r religious life. Notwithstand- 
ing the fact that the Lord had 
manifested himself to the world 
through his only begotten Son, and 
that the Redeemer had made the 
doctrines of his gospel so plain and 
simple that none need mistake them, 
had organized his Church with its 
powers and duty clearly defined, 
and that the people of the world 
had his written word before them, 
men had drifted away from the 
truth into a religious system as de- 
structive of real faith, and as pow- 
erless to satisfy the religions aspira- 
tions of men, as were their systems 
of civil government to satisfy the 
demand for political reform. 

The scripture was misinterpreted, 
the clearly defined laws of the gos- 
pel transgressed, the ordinances of 
the Church entirely changed. A 
multitude of conflicting creeds had 
sprung from the mother church, 
each teaclrng its own doctrine, 
preaching for hire, divining for 
money, teaching for doctrine the 
commandments of men, having a 
form of godliness, but denying the 
power thereof. One declaring that 
all men who had heard' the name of 
the Redeemer, and rejected it, or 
even those who had never heard his 
name, and died without knowledge 
of his mission or mhrstry, were 
consigned to endless torment, in a 
hell of eternal burning from which 
there could be no escape worlds 
without end. Another declaring 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 



53 



that some men were foreordained 
to salvation, and others to eternal 
■damnation, and that no act of theirs 
could in any way change this in- 
evitable decree of God. This doc- 
trine may be found in the creeds of 
existing churches. I warrant that 
the man who conceived the thought, 
like the man who believed in the 
divine right of kings, believed him- 
self to be the one divinely favored 
as against other men. 

Such was the religious confusion 
which existed in the world when 
the time came for the restoration 
of the simple truths taught by the 
Redeemer, and the re-establishment 
of his Church for the salvation of 
mankind. The time, the place, the 
circumstances under which this 
restoration was to be effected, had 
been as clearly set forth by the 
prophets as any event in the hand- 
dealings of the Lord with his chil- 
dren. The old world had rejected 
the Redeemer, had crucified him, 
and persecuted the Church until it 
had ceased to exist. 

The new world was the proper 
place for the restoration, this glori- 
ous government the proper guar- 
dian of the Church, old things were 
passing away, all things were be- 
coming new, the first was to be last, 
the last first. Just as the establish- 
ment of our government was ac- 
complished by simple means, so was 
the restoration of the gospel. Just 
■ as the men who, under God, found- 
ed this Republic, gave to the world 
the best fundamental civil law ever 
offered, so did Joseph Smith, 
through whom the Lord established 
his Church, give to the world the 
greatest moral code it has ever 
known, not his, but Christ's, re- 
stored through him. Just as this 
government is world-wide, and be- 
longs to no race of people, so is 



the Church world-wide, and belongs 
to no sect or creed. Just as in the 
state the more exalted place within 
its gift is open to the humblest citi- 
zen, so in the Church is righteous- 
ness and good works the standard 
by which men are judged, and not 
by the heritage of birth. Like the 
State the Church says to all men, 
come unto me all you who labor and 
are heavy laden, and I will give 
you rest. But you must come as 
true Americans, leave behind the 
prejudices and traditions of the 
past, disavow allegiance to all other 
governments, you must support and 
defend the constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, 
foreign or domestic, and true faith 
and allegiance give to its institu- 
tions, if you would participate in 
the God-given privileges which this 
country affords, and if you are to 
enjoy the eternal blessings which 
the restored gospel offers to all 
men, you must repent of your sins, 
forsake them, and have them wash- 
ed away by baptism in the name of 
the Redeemer, and continue to live 
in righteousness during your mor- 
tal life. 

Yielding obedience to these prin- 
ciples you find here a government, 
and a Church, both founded upon 
principles of eternal truth, designed 
of God to bring civil and relig- 
ious emancipation to the world. The 
state declaring the personal liberty 
of the individual, in civil life, but 
restraining him when he infringes 
upon the rights of others, leaving 
him free to exercise his right to 
worship as he may desire, or to not 
worship at all, declaring that no 
law shall ever be enacted establish- 
ing a form of religion, or denying 
the free exercise of religious belief. 
The Church declaring its unquali- 
fied adherence to these principles, 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



exercising- among its members the 
right to trial for fellowship only, 
where conduct is unbecoming and 
contrary to the word of the Lord. 
That this latter statement may not 
be doubted, let me read: 

"We believe that governments 
were instituted of God for the ben- 
efit of man, and that he holds men 
accountable for their acts in rela- 
tion to them, either in making laws 
or administering them, for the good 
and safety of society. 

"We believe that no government 
can exist in peace, except such laws 
are framed and held inviolate as 
will secure to each individual the 
free exercise of conscience, the 
right and control of property, and 
protection of life. 

"We believe that religion is insti- 
tuted of Gad, and that men are 
amenable to him, and to him only, 
for the exercise of it, unless their 
religious opinions prompt them to 
infringe upon the rights of others; 
but we do not believe that human 
law has a right to interfere in pre- 
scribing rules of worship to bind 
the consciences of men, nor dictate 
forms for public or private devo- 
tion; that the civil magistrate 
should restrain crime, but never 
control conscience; should punish 
guilt, but never suppress the free- 
dom of the soul. 

"We do not believe it just to 
mingle religious influence with civil 
government, whereby one religious 
society is fostered, and another pro- 
scribed in its spiritual privileges, 
and the individual rights of its 
members as citizens, denied. 

"We believe that all religious so- 
cieties have the right to deal with 
their members for disorderly con- 
duct according to the rules and 
regulations of such societies, pro- 
vided that such dealings he for fel- 



lowship and good standing; but we 
do not believe that any religious 
society has the right to try men on 
the right of property or life, to take 
from them this world's goods, or to 
put them in jeopardy of either life 
or limb, neither to inflict any phys- 
ical punishment upon them, they 
can only excommunicate them from 
their society, and withdraw from 
them their fellowship." 

I want to ask you, my brethren 
and sisters, if a better declaration, 
defining the attitude of the Church 
to the State, and the State to the 
Church, has ever been offered to 
the world than that which I have 
read. It is not a reformed doctrine 
of the Church either, but one which 
has stood from its inception until 
today; one which is in perfect har- 
mony with the laws of our country. 

I have been thinking of these civil 
and Church laws and applying them 
to the great issue which is before 
the world today. Are we to revert 
to barbarism? Is the divine right 
of kings to be established among 
the children of men ? Are the God- 
given liberties which are guaranteed 
under our constitution to be tram- 
pled under foot, and the great work 
which has been accomplished since 
the restoration of the gospel of 
Christ destroyed by ruthless men 
who honor neither God, man, nor 
religion? These things are in the 
balance, the wage of battle is on, 
these great questions are to be de- 
cided one way or the other. If we 
love them, if we are determined in 
our hearts that they shall not perish 
from the earth, it remains for us 
not only to live for them, but if 
necessary to die for them, as men 
who have lived before us have done. 
I feel authorized to say, here this 
afternoon, that these liberties which 
have come to men, both religious 



ELDER JOSEPH C. BENTLEY.

and civil, have not been established 
by the Lord to be destroyed, but 
that they are here to remain until 
liberty shall prevail from the rivers 
to the ends of the earth, until God's 
kingdom shall be established among 
men, and his will done upon earth 
as it is done in heaven. Until the 
universal Fatherhood of God, and 
brotherhood of man shall be rec- 
ognized, and the kingdoms of this 
world become the kingdoms of 
Christ, who shall reign as Prince of 
Peace, which may God grant, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER J. C. BENTLEY. 

(Of the Juarez Stake, Mexico.) 

Brethren and Sisters: The few 
moments that I shall occupy this 
afternoon, I earnestly pray that I 
may be inspired by the Spirit of 
the Lord, that I may say something 
that will be instructive and may 
perhaps be an incentive to our de- 
votion to our heavenly Father. 

The testimonies of this confer- 
ence, and in fact everything con- 
nected with it, the hymns that have 
been sung, and the sweet music that 
we have heard this afternoon, have 
had a peculiar sweetness to me, 
something that has been divinely 
sweet, and yet with it all, it has 
impressed me with a feeling of 
sweet sadness, an impression that 
in our history as a people we are 
perhaps commencing upon a new 
chapter. The impression to my 
mind is almost like we were start- 
ing out upon a journey. The end 
is not so certain, and yet we know 
that the end will bring us victory 



and peace and happiness. The im- 
pressive testimonies that have been 
borne, it seems to me should inspire 
us to start upon this journey with a 
faith in our heavenly Father that 
will bear us triumphantly through 
this journey to the end. 

The few Latter-day Saints, who 
have been located in the republic 
of Meixco, have had now over five 
years of experience in war, and I 
want to bear you my testimony that 
there is no pleasure in war. It has 
always been my prayer to the Lord 
that this people may be kept out 
from war, that we may not be 
mixed up with the war of the na- 
tions of the earth. I have always 
hoped for peace, and in my own 
country, the country of Mexico, to 
which I belong, I have always 
prayed that the Lord would bring 
us peace. After our exodus from 
the Juarez stake of Zion, the Lord 
inspired a few of his children — not 
because of their goodness nor their 
extreme faith — but he inspired a 
few to return to those colonies. 
What his purpose was I do not 
know. It was not our business to 
know. But I want to bear my tes- 
timony to you that the few Latter- 
day Saints who returned to those 
colonies were inspired of the Lord 
to return, without arms, without 
protection, so far as this world was 
concerned, absolutely helpless, and 
we returned, few in number, and 
our conditions were such that the 
Lord was the only source in which 
we could put our trust. I want to 
bear testimony to you, to the youth 
of Zion, to the young men who 
shall embark upon this journey 
which we seem to be inevitably 
forced upon, that I know, as I know 
I have an existence here this after- 
noon, that the Lord has preserved 
that handful of people. When men 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have come into our midst with the 
determination in their hearts to 
commit murder, to ravish families, 
and to destroy the homes and the 
property of that little handful of 
people, our escape has heen mar- 
velous to us, and I want to bear my 
testimony to the youth of Zion that 
God has preserved his people by his 
power. It has been thought fool- 
ishness, and we have been called 
foolish — the world, even our neigh- 
bors, our Mexican friends, have 
felt that we were very foolish in- 
deed, and yet, my brethren and sis- 
ters, the Lord has preserved his 
people. 

I want to bear my testimony to 
the youth of Zion today that we are 
living in perilous times, so far as 
the things of this world are con- 
cerned, those things that will de- 
tract us from the service of the 
Lord. We must come to the part- 
ing of the ways. If we expect to 
maintain ourselves during the com- 
ing period of our existence, we 
must have faith in God ; we must 
put our trust in him ; and we cannot 
do it unless we live conscientiously 
the principles of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Men and wom- 
en and families who do not pray to 
the Lord, who do not keep the 
Word of Wisdom and observe the 
Sabbath day, cannot have faith in 
God, the eternal Father. It requires 
the observance of these things in 
order to have faith in the Lord. 

I want to bear testimony to the 
good work that has been done by 
the American army cdming into 
that country. It has been thought 
by some to have been a failure, and 
many have branded it as a failure 
and a mistake, that the American 
army was * ever sent into our coun- 
try ; but through the splendid course 
of the men who stood at the head 



of that army, they have won the 
hearts of the Mexican people. In- 
stead of destroying life and prop- 
erty, instead of trampling down the 
rights of the Mexican people, a 
spirit of kindness, a spirit of hu- 
manity was extended, and today the 
Mexican people feel much more 
friendly to the people of the United 
States ; that is, the peaceable Mex- 
icans, feel far better today, than 
they ever have felt before. I don't 
know what shall be the result of 
this contention, it may be that our 
boys, the boys of this country, the 
young men of this Church, may 
have to go into Mexico. I don't 
know what the result will be, but 
if they can go with the spirit of 
this conference, if they can go with 
the instructions that have been 
given to us by those who have 
spoken here during this conference, 
I know that victory will be with the 
people of God, if we can maintain 
the spirit and the teachings of this 
conference. I hope the time will 
come, if we shall ever go into the 
army of the United States, that we 
can plant there the seeds of the 
everlasting gospel, and that we can 
establish the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ and a reputation for 
honesty, for clean lives, for virtue, 
and peace, and for the kingdom of 
God, that will bring honor and 
credit to the Latter-day Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, the few 
people who are still remaining in 
Mexico have enjoyed a period of 
peace. After the coming out of the 
American army there was consid- 
erable concern as to what would be 
our condition when the forces of 
General Villa should reach us. It 
was well understood that they were 
only waiting to occupy the territory 
that was vacated by the American 
army, and there were rumors that

57 



they had been instructed to kill all 
foreigners, all Americans especial- 
ly, and to come to the colonies as 
soon as the army should retire. 
They came and visited us, and we 
are grateful to say that they left 
us feeling better than they did when 
they came. They were awful hun- 
gry when they came, and when they 
went away they were somewhat 
filled up, because we had given them 
a part of our substance. When they 
reached our colony General Salazar 
was somewhat ugly and gave us to 
understand that they did not want 
any "Pacificos" in Mexico, they 
•only wanted fighting men, and we 
could either fight or leave the coun- 
try. But after a short conference 
with them and explaining the pur- 
pose of our being there and our 
mission among them, they felt bet- 
ter, and General Salazar gave me 
his word that so far as he was con- 
cerned our people were welcome to 
remain in Mexico. We have con- 
tinued, up to the present time, to 
maintain in friendly relation with 
that people, simply by carrying out, 
as near as we could, the instructions 
that had been given to us, and as 



they have been given to us here 
during this conference. 

May the blessings of the Lord 
rest upon us and help us as a people 
to magnify our calling wherever 
we shall go, carrying with us the 
spirit of the everlasting gospel; 
•that we may be worshipers of the 
Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and 
carry into the army, or wherever we 
shall go, the teachings of the gospel 
of our Lord and Savior, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Notices of overflow meetings on 
Sunday to be held in the Assembly 
Hall and at the Bureau of Informa- 
tion, and of appointments for pre- 
siding brethren and speakers, were 
read by President Smith. 

The closing music was a baritone 
solo and mixed chorus by the Juab 
stake choir, entitled, "The Lord 
hath brought again Zion." — Arthur 
Shepherd. 

The benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Joseph H. Dye, of the 
Shelley stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 
10 o'clock Sunday morning. 



THIRD DAY. 



Conference continued in the Tab : 
ernacle, 10 a. m., Sunday, April 8, 
1917, President Joseph F. Smith, 
presiding. 

President Smith announced over- 
flow meetings to be held in the As- 
sembly Hall this morning under di- 
rection of Elder Joseph E. Robin- 
son, of the California mission ; also 
an open air meeting at the Bureau 
of Information, under direction of 
Elder Walter P. Monson, president 
of the Eastern States mission, both 
for the accommodation of persons 
who could not find seats in the great 
Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle choir sang : "The 
Lord is my Shepherd." 

Prayer by Elder James H. Robin- 
son, president of the South Davis 
stake of Zion. 

The Tabernacle choir sang an an- 
them : "They that sow in tears 
shall reap in joy." 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 

The moral and religious condition of 
the world today is no better than in 
the .early nineteenth century — There 
is a lack of geunine faith among the 
people in Jesus Christ as the Son 
of the living God, in his resurrec- 
tion, and in his atonement for the 
sins of the world — The Latter-day 
Saints possess faith in these doc- 
trines, and believe in the literal res- 
urrection of the body from the grave 
— After the resurrection our bodies 
will be tangible, purified, bodies of 
flesh and bones, as was the body of 
Jesus before he ascended into heav- 
en — Schools and colleges troubled 
with vain philosophies, theories, and 
"scientific fiction" — Duty of the 
Saints is to consider false any doc- 
trine that conflicts with the revealed 



word of God, and to seek the Lord 
and obey his commandments. 

It is, my brothers and sisters, 
trusting in the Lord and hoping for 
the direction of the Holy Spirit that 
I stand before you this morning for 
the purpose of bearing my testi- 
mony in regard to the gospel of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and 
to give expression to such thoughts 
as may come to me while I am here 
in this position, for I fully believe 
in the gospel which has been re- 
vealed in these latter days for the 
salvation of all mankind who will 
repent and believe. I have a firm 
testimony of the mission of our Re- 
deemer, and it is my duty, so far as 
I have the power, to raise my voice 
and to declare unto the people, not 
only of the Latter-day Saints, but 
in all the world, that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God. 
I desire to read a few verses from 
section 84 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants which, I think, are very 
timely. This revelation was given 
in the presence of s : x elders of the 
Church after their return from a 
mission where they had been 
preaching the principles of the gos- 
pel in the western lands, as it was 
understood at that time. They had 
returned to Kirtland, in Ohio, re- 
joicing in the testimony of the 
truth, in the manifestations of the 
Spirit unto them and the goodness 
of the Lord in their ministry, and 
the Prophet Joseph Smith received 
a revelation in their presence in 
which the following occurs : 

"And I now give unto you a com- 
mandment to beware concerning 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



59 



yourselves, to give diligent heed to 
the words of eternal life; 

"For you shall live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the 
mouth of God. 

"For the word of the Lord is 
truth, and whatsoever is truth is 
light, and whatsoever is light is 
Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus 
Christ ; 

"And the Spirit giveth l : ght to 
every man that cometh into the 
world ; and the Spirit enlighteneth 
every man through the world, that 
hearkeneth to the voice of the 
Spirit; 

"And every one that hearkeneth 
to the voice of the Spirit, cometh 
unto God, even the Father; 

"And the Father teacheth him of 
the covenant which he has renewed 
and confirmed upon you, which is 
confirmed upon you for your sakes, 
and not for your sakes only, but for 
the sake of the whole world ; 

"And the whole world lieth in 
sin, and groaneth under darkness 
and under the bondage of sin; 

"And by this you may know they 
are under the bondage of sin, be- 
cause they come not unto me. 

"For whoso cometh not unto me 
is under the bondage of sin ; 

"And whoso receiveth not my 
voice is not acquainted with my 
voice, and is not of me ; 

"And by this you may know the 
righteous from the wicked, and that 
the whole world groaneth under sin 
and darkness even now." 

That was true when this revela- 
tion was given, in the year 1832. It 
is true today, and perhaps these 
words can be expressed with 
greater force regarding the condi- 
tions that prevail in the world in 
this day than could be the case, 
speaking of the people in the day 
when the revelation was given. I 



am not one of those who believt 
that the world is growing better; 
I do not consider myself a pess : mist 
either, but I do not believe that the 
world is becoming more righteous, 
that the inhabitants are drawing 
nearer unto God, that there is in 
the hearts of the people a greater 
desire today to serve him than in 
the year 1832; but, on the other 
hand, since that day the peoples of 
the nations of the earth have been 
drifting, and drifting farther and 
farther from the truth. When I 
make this statement I am fully 
aware that there has been progres- 
sion in certain directions. I am 
aware that in these latter days there 
has been a movement among the na- 
tions and in our own land to over- 
come the evils of strong drink, and 
all these things will bring their re- 
sults for good, but so far as their 
observance of the doctrines of the 
gospel is concerned, so far as their 
righteousness is concerned, I do 
not believe that they are any 
better, nay, I do not believe 
that the people are as good now, 
as they were when this revelation 
was given. The world today is 
full of vain philosophy, full of doc- 
trine that is not of the Lord, full 
of false conclusions, ideas and theo- 
ries that were not a part of the gos- 
pel in the days of the Son of God, 
and hence are not a part of it now, 
but on the contrary are in absolute 
contradiction of the truth. There 
are fewer, in my judgment, among 
the Christian peoples, who believe 
in the Son of God as the Redeemer 
of the world. The tendency has 
been, during all these years, to get 
farther away from the principles of 
the gospel as they are contained in 
the holy scriptures. The worship 
of reason, of false philosophy, is 
greater now than it was then. Men

are depending upon their own re- 
search to find out God, and that 
which they cannot discover and 
which they cannot demonstrate to 
their satisfaction through their own 
research and their natural senses, 
they reject. They are not seeking 
for the Spirit of the Lord, they are 
not striving to know God in the 
manner in which he has marked out 
by which he may be known, but 
they are walking in their own way, 
believing in their own man-made 
philosophies, and teaching the doc- 
trines of devils and not the doc- 
trines of the Son of God. 

Today, throughout the world, the 
people of the various Christian de- 
nominations are assembling in their 
churches because it is Easter Sun- 
day. They have not assembled there 
because they have faith in the lit- 
eral resurrection of the Lord ; they 
have not assembled there because 
they believe in the literal resurrec- 
tion of all mankind through the 
atonement of our Lord, and they 
have not assembled because they 
acept him as the Son of God. I 
want to make honorable exceptions, 
because there are some who have 
done so, but I speak generally. They 
have assembled there for a very 
different purpose — because it is the 
custom, because in, many cases 
among the sisters they want to 
show their millinery and the styles 
of their clothing, their dress. They 
are there more in the nature of a 
social function and fashion show 
than to worsh : p the Lord, and I 
say this notwithstanding the ex- 
pression that appears in one of our 
morning papers to the effect that 
anybody who expresses this kind of 
an idea is cynical and expresses a 
perverted opinion. 

The people of the various na- 
tions, who call themselves Chris- 



tian, today do not worship the Lord 
Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of the 
world to the extent that they did 
even in the day of the organization 
of the Church. The doctrines today 
that prevail are in opposition to that 
truth, and ministers stand before 
their people 'denying the atonement 
of Christ, and hence showing their 
lack of faith in and understanding 
of the resurrection of the Son of 
God, and denying the universal res- 
urrection which the scriptures 
promise shall come to all mankind. 
I have an expression here that I 
desire to read. This is taken from 
a book published in the year 1914, 
the title of which is, A Century's 
Change in Religion, and the author, 
Mr. George Harris, speaking of 
these changes has the following to 
say in regard to the Son of God : 

"The virgin birth is not regarded 
as an essential doctrine of Chris- 
tianity. The belief that Jesus tran- 
scended humanity, that he was sin- 
less, rests on his life, teachings, and 
work, not on the manner of his 
birth. There are only two accounts 
of the miraculous conception and 
these are stories, written thirty 
years later, of visions that Mary 
and Joseph were said to have had. 
There is no reference to the virgin 
birth elsewhere in the New Testa- 
ment or by Jesus himself. 

"The resurrection of Christ sig- 
nifies the everlasting Lord. What- 
ever the appearances of Jesus to the 
disciples may have been, whether 
actual manifestations we cannot un- 
derstand, or subjective visions in 
which his person seemed real, it is 
certain the disciples were convinced 
that Jesus lived. * * * 

"The physical world and the 
bodies of men are but temporary 
conditions in which the spirit is lo- 
calized, while it responds to the 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.

spiritual forces which know nothing 
of distance, but flash from life to 
life instantly, as the lowly plant re- 
sponds to the light and heat and 
magnetism which pervade the uni- 
verse." This is found on pages 99 
to 101. Again he says: 

"My influence, shaping the life of 
others, has in view the values that 
constitute the man immortal. And 
the thought of immortality cannot 
be banished, but persists in one 
form or another, even if it be in so 
attenuated a form as influence on 
others. Corporate immortality, as 
the only immortality, is not much 
debated now, though we believe in 
it and delight in it, have pride in 
the family, — backwards to ancestry, 
forward to descendants ; even as the 
scriptures saith, the promise is to 
the children's children, to a thou- 
sand generations. A rather hold 
writer, thinking of past generations 
of faithful, noble men, links them 
to the present, which surpasses them 
in knowledge of the truth, saying 
that not only do they help us, but 
also that we help them ; that 'apart 
from us they should not be made 
perfect.' 

"The Jews at the time of Christ 
believed in the resurrection of the 
body, except the sect of Sad.ducees, 
who said there is no resurrection. 
For several centuries of the Chris- 
tian era it was the common 
belief. The earlier creeds af- 
firmed it in so many words : 
T believe in the resurrection of 
the body and the life everlasting.' 
The Apostle Paul disclaimed it, and 
called that man a fool, a foolish one, 
who supposed that this very body of 
flesh and blood will be raised up. 
It is not a physical body, that will 
be raised, he says, but a sp : ritual 
body. There are celestial bodies and 
bodies terrestrial ; Out the glory of 



the celestial is one, and the glory of 
the terrestrial is another. And as 
we have borne the image of the 
earthly, we shall also bear the image 
of the heavenly. I suppose nobody 
now believes in the literal resurrec- 
tion of the body. When we repeat 
the pharse in the Apostles' Creed 
we think of that for which it stands 
and which immediately follows — 
the life everlasting." This is taken 
from pages 177 and 178. 

Another writer commenting in an 
Easter sermon, or editorial, in one 
of our leading magazines, a year or 
two ago, had this to say, speaking 
of the doctrine of the literal resur- 
rection of the body : 

"All this is a beautiful and facile 
faith. It takes the world quite too 
easily. It rests everything on the 
power of God. It is harder for us, 
in these .days of science, to believe 
quite so readily what seems unrea- 
sonable, and on authority of a creed 
which the apostles never heard." — 
That in reference to this Apostles' 
Creed already mentioned. — "We 
prefer to talk of the spiritual body 
which is not the body of this flesh. 
It is the spiritual body which will 
arise, that is, will survive ; and the 
spiritual body is the soul immortal. 
We do not understand any other 
body. So we interpret Paul. And 
in the assurance of the eternal life 
with Christ we rest on his promise, 
'this .day shalt thou be with me in 
Paradise.' " 

That is the doctrine of a large 
part of the Christian world, and I 
want to say to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that it is false doctrine, 
that it is not the gospel taught by 
Jesus Christ, and there is no war- 
rant in the scriptures for any such 
conclusions. Paul .did not express 
anywhere in his writings that there 
should not be a resurrection of the 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



body and a re-uniting of the body 
with the spirit, and those who in- 
terpret the writings of Paul — and 
they have reference to his state- 
ment in the fifteenth chapter of first 
Corinthians — do not understand the 
scriptures. They have no idea of 
what Paul was speaking ; they mis- 
interpret, they put a false construc- 
tion upon the teachings of the 
scriptures, not being led by the 
Spirit of the Lord. I believe, and 
you believe, all Latter-day Saints 
believe, in the literal resurrection 
of the body and its reuniting with 
the spirit, thus becoming, as the 
scriptures informs us, the soul of 
man. The resurrection of the Son 
of God was typical. We are in- 
formed that his body did not see 
corruption, although it was placed 
in the' tomb and remained there for 
the three .days, according to the pre- 
dictions in the scriptures. Again, 
that body was taken up and spirit 
and body again united inseparably, 
and in that form he appeared unto 
his disciples who were unconvinced 
when he appeared to them and 
"were terrified and affrighted," the 
scriptures say, thinking they had 
seen a spirit. He manifested to 
them that it was himself, and called 
upon them, in order to convince 
them that it was the body that was 
laid in the tomb, to come and han- 
dle him and see for themselves that 
it was his body that had been 
pierced and they thrust their hands 
into the wounds in his hands, his 
feet and his side. 

As he arose from the dead, so 
shall all men rise ; both the just and 
the unjust shall come forth from 
the grave. The sea shall give up 
its dead ; the grave shall give up 
its dead ; all shall come forth and 
stand before the judgment seat of 
God to be judged according to their 



works. They shall not all come 
forth at the same time. Those who 
are Christ's shall come forth at his 
coming. Matthew informs us that 
following the resurrection of the 
Son of God "the graves were open- 
ed, and many bodies of the Saints 
which slept arose and came out of 
their graves and went into the holy 
city and appeared unto many." 

These modern blind teachers of 
the blind have a very false under- 
standing of what is meant by a spir- 
itual body. They have based their 
conclusion on the statement that 
Paul makes that the body is raised 
a spiritual body, and that flesh and 
blood cannot inherit the kingdom 
of God. They cannot conceive in 
their minds a body raised from the 
dead, being composed of flesh and 
bones, quickened by spirit and not 
by blood. When Paul spoke of the 
spiritual body he had no reference 
at all to the spirit body and there 
they have made their mistake. They 
have confused the spiritual body, 
or, in other words, the body quick- 
ened by the spirit, with the body of 
the spirit alone. They think that 
those who believe in the resurrec- 
tion of the literal body believe that 
it shall be raised again, quickened 
by blood, which is not the case. I 
want to read another verse from 
the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Now, verily I say unto you, that 
through the redemption which is 
made for you is brought to pass the 
resurrection from the dead. 

"And the spirit and the body is 
the soul of man. 

"And the resurrection from the 
dead is the redemption of the soul ; 

"And the redemption of the soul 
is through him who quickeneth all 
things, in whose bosom it is decreed 
that the poor and the meek of the 
earth shall inherit it. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



"Therefore it [the earth] must 
needs be sanctified from all un- 
righteousness, that it may be pre- 
pared for the celestial glory ; 

"For after it hath filled the meas- 
ure of its creation, it shall be 
crowned with glory, even with the 
presence of God the Father; 

"That bodies who are of the ce- 
lestial kingdom may possess it for 
ever and ever; for, for this intent 
was it made and created, and for 
this intent are they sanctified." 

"And again, verily I say unto 
you, the earth abideth the law of a 
celestial kingdom, for it filleth the 
measure of its creation and trans- 
gresseth not the law. 

"Wherefore it shall be sanctified ; 
yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it 
shall be quickened again, and shall 
abide the power by which it is 
quickened, and the righteous shall 
inherit it; 

"For notwithstanding they die, 
they also shall rise aga : n a spiritual 
body : 

"They who are of a celestial spirit 
shall receive the same body which 
was a natural body; even ye shall 
receive your bodies, and your glory 
shall be that glory by which your 
bodies are quickened. 

"Ye who are quickened by a por- 
tion of the celestial glory shall then 
receive of the same, even a fulness ; 

"And they who are quickened by 
a portion of the terrestrial glory 
shall then receive of the same, even 
a fulness ;" and so on. 

After the resurrection from the 
dead our bodies will be spiritual 
bodies, but they will be bodies that 
are tangible, bodies that have been 
purified, but they will nevertheless 
be bodies of flesh and bones, but 
they will not be blood bodies, they 
will no longer te quickened by blood 



but quickened by the spirit whxh is 
eternal and they shall become im- 
mortal and shall never die. 

Now, if our good friends under- 
stood this, they would not fall into 
this error of thinking that Paul's 
doctrine was in conflict with that of 
the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
when Paul declared that the body 
that would be raised would be a 
spiritual body. You read in the 
Book of Genesis, where the Lord 
said to Noah after the flood, that 
the blood was the life of the body; 
the blood is the life thereof, he says. 
Therefore, whoso sheddeth man's 
blood, by man shall his blood be 
shed, because blood is the life of the 
mortal body, but with the body 
brought forth in the resurrection, 
which is the immortal body, that is 
not the case, in it blood does not 
exist, but the spirit is the life-giving 
power and hence they are no longer 
bodies quickened by blood but 
bodies quickened by spirit and hence 
they are spiritual bodies, but tangi- 
ble bodies of flesh and bones, just 
as was the body of the Son of God. 
Now this is the doctrine of the 
Lord and Savior of the world. 

I had a conversation with a man 
one time, a minister, and he took 
this view which prevails so largely 
in the world, and I forced him, by 
the reading of the scriptures, to ad- 
mit that when the Savior appeared 
to his disciples and said unto them, 
"Behold my hands and my feet, that 
it is I myself; handle me, and see; 
for a spirit hath not flesh and bones 
as ye see me have," that the Savior 
really spoke the truth, and I asked 
h : m, "that being true, then how in 
the world do you believe, how can 
you believe, that today he sits in the 
heavens without a body of flesh and 
bones?" His answer was, "After 
he ascended from the Mount of 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Olives he shed his body of flesh and 
bones." I asked him for the chap- 
ter and verse and, of course, he was 
unable to give it. 

The Lord has very clearly set 
forth the doctrine of the resurrec- 
tion. He declared shortly before 
his crucifixion that the hour was 
coming and, he said, now is, when 
the dead shall hear the voice of the 
Son of God, and they that hear shall 
live. Even his disciples wondered 
what he meant. They marveled at 
it, they could not fully comprehend 
it, notwithstanding the fact that 
they believed in the literal resur- 
rection of the body in those days, 
and the Savior seeing their perplex- 
ity said unto them and unto the peo- 
ple who were there assembled: 
"Marvel not at this: for the hour 
is coming in the which all that are 
in their graves shall hear his voice 
and shall come forth, they that 
have done good unto the resurrec- 
tion of life, and they that have done 
evil unto the resurrection of dam- 
nation." Now the world interprets 
that to mean those who are dead in 
trespasses and sin, those who are in 
bondage of iniquity should hear his 
voice, but the Lord meant literally 
just what he said when he declared 
that the dead should hear his voice 
and should come forth, they that 
had done good unto the resurrec- 
tion of life, and they that had done 
evil unto the resurrection of dam- 
nation, for the resurrection shall 
come upon all mankind for they are 
not responsible for death. The Lord 
will not punish them for Adam's 
transgression. Therefore, he took 
upon him the sins of all mankind 
and redeemed every creature from 
death and granted unto each one of 
us a resurrection, but not eternal 
life, not salvation, not an existence 
in the presence of his Father in the 



celestial kingdom. That comes 
through faithfulness, through dili- 
gence, through perseverance on our 
part and through our belief and ac- 
ceptance and our keeping of the 
commandments of the Lord. Now 
I said in the beginning that the 
World is full of philosophy. One 
prominent and intelligent writer 
has called these theories, "scientific 
fiction." I think he is right. We 
have the theories of evolution, of 
higher criticism, the ideas that pre- 
vail in the schools throughout our 
land that are dangerous, that are 
striking at the fundamentals of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, trying to de- 
stroy the faith in the minds of the 
students who attend the schools. 
We are troubled with it to some ex- 
tent even in our own state and the 
colleges throughout the country are 
full of it, and the professors teach 
it, they believe in it, at least they 
profess to believe in it, and it seems 
to me that the sole purpose of it is 
to undermine and destroy the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. I want to say to 
the Latter-day Saints that it is our 
duty to put our faith in the revealed 
word of God, to accept that which 
has come through inspiration, 
through revelation unto his ser- 
vants, the prophets, both ancient 
and modern, and whenever you find 
any doctrine, any idea, any expres- 
sion from any source whatsoever, 
that is in conflict with that which 
the Lord has revealed and which is 
found in the holy scriptures, you 
may be assured that it is false 
and you should put it aside 
and stand firmly grounded in 
the truth in prayer and in faith, 
relying upon the Spirit of the 
Lord, for knowledge, for wis- 
dom, concerning these principles of 
truth. If you will walk in the light 
as I have read here, and will receive 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR. 



65 



the doctrines of our Redeemer, he 
will grant unto you, through the in- 
spiration that will come from the 
Spirit of the Lord, a testimony of 
the truth and you need not walk in 
darkness nor in doubt, but may have 
a clear and a distinct comprehen- 
sion, and understanding of the truth 
which will make you free. It is our 
duty to seek the Lord, to obey his 
laws, to keep his commandments, to 
put away from us light-mindedness, 
foolishness, and the false theories, 
notions, and philosophies of the 
world, and to accept with fulness of 
heart and in humility these solemn, 
God-given principles which will 
bring unto us eternal life in the 
Celestial kingdom. That we may do 
this is my prayer in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

"Our Father, which art in 
heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy 
kingdom come. Thy will be done 
in earth as it is in heaven." 

Thus did our Lord and Master 
teach the Saints in olden times to 
pray. The pattern whicli He gave 
for prayer has never been super- 
seded nor abrogated. Thus does 
the Christian world profess to pray 
today : "Thy kingdom come. Thy 
will be done in earth as it is in 
heaven." If ever there were ra- 
tional and imperative need for such 
prayer as this, today witnesses that 
need. Who will dare affirm that 



we need no longer pray that the 
kingdom of heaven may come, or 
that the will of God is being 
wrought upon the earth as it is in 
heaven ? 

Do you believe that the kingdom 
of heaven has been already set up 
upon the earth? I do not. I know 
that the kingdom of God has been 
established upon the earth, but the 
kingdom of God is a preparation 
for the kingdom of heaven, which 
is yet to come. The expressions 
"Kingdom of God" and "Kingdom 
of Heaven" are ofttimes used syn- 
onymously and interchangeably in 
our imperfect English translation 
of the Holy Bible, particularly in 
the Gospel according to Matthew, 
where the expression "Kingdom of 
Heaven" is most commonly, used. 
But in these instances, as in so many 
others, the light of modern revela- 
tion clears up the darkness of 
ancient passages ; and the Lord has 
in this day and age made plain the 
fact, beyond all question, that there 
is a distinction between the king- 
dom of God and the kingdom of 
heaven. The kingdom of God is 
the Church of Christ ; the kingdom 
of heaven is that system of govern- 
ment and administration which is 
operative in heaven, and which we 
pray may some day prevail on 
earth. The kingdom of heaven will 
he established when the King shall 
come, as come He shall, in power 
and might and glory, to take do- 
minion in and over and throughout 
the earth. 

Thus spake the Lord in the year 
1831, calling attention to the immi- 
nent duty of the Church and, the 
Saints : 

"Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one 
from on high, who is mighty and 
powerful, whose going forth is unto 
the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is unto men. — Prepare ye the way of 
Lord, make his paths straight. 

"The keys of the kingdom of God 
are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the gospel roll 
forth unto the ends of the earth, as 
the stone which is cut out of the 
mountain without hands shall roll 
forth, until it has filled the whole 
earth; 

"Yea, a voice crying, — Prepare ye 
the way of the Lord, prepare ye the 
supper of the Lamb, make ready for 
the Bridegroom; 

"Pray unto the Lord, call upon his 
holy name, make known his wonderful 
works among the people; 

"Call upon the Lord, that his king- 
dom may go forth upon the earth, 
that the inhabitants thereof may re- 
ceive it, and be prepared for the days 
to come, in the which the Son of Man 
shall come down in heaven, clothed 
in the brightness of his glory, to meet, 
the kingdom of God which is set up 
on the earth; 

"Wherefore may the kingdom of 
God go forth, that the kingdom of 
heaven may come, that thou, O God, 
mayest be glorified in heaven so on 
earth, that thy enemies may be sub- 
dued; for thine is the honor, power 
and glory, for ever and ever. Amen." 

Thus reads the revelation known 
to us as Section 65 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants. The kingdom of 
heaven shall come, and then shall 
justice rule in the earth. No longer 
shall men rise in unrighteous do- 
minion over their fellows. No 
longer shall men exalt themselves 
on thrones, nor adorn themselves 
with crowns and scepters. The best 
form of government possible unto 
man is a monarchy with the right 
kind of a monarch, who will do 
only justice, full justice, and with 
due regard to the claims of mercy, 
give unto every man his right. Such 
a government will be democracy 
and monarchy combined, and such 
is the government of the kingdom 
of heaven. 

The work of the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints may be 
summed up as the preparation of 
the earth for the coming of its Lord 
and King. As in the meridian of 
time the voice of the Baptist was 
heard in the wilderness, "Repent 
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is 
at hand," so has the voice of that 
same John the Baptist been heard 
in this day, restoring the authority 
of the Priesthood requisite to the 
administration of the ordinance of 
baptism, whereby remission of sins 
may be obtained ; and the procla- 
mation is made now, "The kingdom 
of heaven is at hand." That pro- 
clamation is authoritatively sounded 
throughout the world ; and the work 
of the Church, which is veritably 
the kingdom of God, is to prepare 
the earth for the coming of the 
King of earth and heaven, and for 
the establishment of the kingdom 
of heaven upon the earth. 

We Latter-day Saints are peculi- 
arly literal in our acceptance of 
plain scripture. We believe that the 
Scriptures are very simple to under- 
stand, if we can only get the theo- 
logians to leave them alone and not 
confuse us with explanations. The 
Spirit of the Lord will enlighten the 
mind of the earnest reader, and will 
interpret the Scriptures, for that is 
the spirit in which the Scriptures 
were written. When we read in 
prophecy, ancient and modern, and 
find in all predictions bearing upon 
th : s subject a strict unanimity, with- 
out any shadow of contradiction or 
inconsistency, we hold it to be a 
fact beyond question that the 
Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, who 
lived in the flesh, who was actually 
crucified, and who .did take up that 
same body of flesh and bones that 
had lain in the tomb of Joseph of 
Arimathea, shall come in that same 
body and stand upon the earth and

mingle with His people, and rule 
and reign. 

Forty days after the day in com- 
memoration of which this Easter 
Sunday is celebrated throughout 
Christendom, Christ led out His 
faithful servants, those who had 
been commissioned to administer in 
the authority of the holy Priesthoo.d 
after He would leave, led them out 
to the historic little mount, Olivet; 
and there after communing with 
them and giving them final instruc- 
tions, answering some of their 
eager questions, and putting others 
aside with but partial answer be- 
cause the brethren were unprepared 
to fully comprehend, He ascended 
from their midst. They saw Him 
ascend; there was no shedding of 
body or robe ; and as they watched 
Him disappearing in the upper deep 
they became aware of the presence 
of two white-robed angels, who ad- 
dressed them saying: "Ye men of 
Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into 
heaven? This same Jesus, which is 
taken up from you into heaven, 
shall so come in like manner as ye 
have seen him go into heaven." 

I admit that we Latter-day Saints 
are behind the times in many re- 
spects. We are still simple-minded 
enough to believe what the Scrip- 
tures say, which is the truth, and 
which cannot be gainsaid. Time 
forbids me citing even the most im- 
portant and most striking of ancient 
prophecies relating to the coming of 
the Son of God in the .dispensation 
of fulness, which is known as the 
day of vengeance. It was shown 
unto the prophets, however, even in 
the most ancient of times. Adam 
learned of it. Enoch, the seventh 
from Adam, prophesied of it, de- 
claring that in the last days Jesus 
the Christ would come with ten 
thousand of His saints to rule in 



person upon the earth for a thou- 
sand years. I find nothing ambig- 
uous in that, nothing requiring an 
interpreter. If I understand Eng- 
lish at all, if I am more than a child 
in understanding, I can comprehend 
what that declaration means ; and I 
believe it in its impressive literal- 
ness and in all its grand and glori- 
ous simplicity. 

In preparing the world for the 
coming of the Lord there is a duty 
laid upon the Church as an organ- 
ization, and upon every member of 
the Church individually; and that 
duty or obligation is to carry the 
word to our neighbors, to all with 
whom we may come in contact. Re- 
member the mission of the Church 
is not wholly and solely to convert 
men to the acceptance of its princi- 
ples and to bring them into mem- 
bership. The duty laid upon us is 
also that of warning the world of 
the judgments that are to come. 
Can you doubt that the present 
dread scenes of conflict and slaugh- 
ter on land and sea, in the air and 
beneath the water, are insignificant 
as signs of the times ? 

In that solemn interview which 
Christ had with His apostles just 
after their departure from the 
temple for the last time, in the 
course of the evening walk back to 
Bethany, He rested on the slopes of 
Olivet, and the apostles came to 
Him privately to ask certain ques- 
tions regarding the time of His 
coming, which He had in part ex- 
plained to them. Read for your- 
selves the twenty-fourth chapter of 
Matthew and the twenty-first chap- 
ter of Luke. The burden of the 
Lord's instructions was this : 
Watch, for ye know not the day nor 
the hour. He went so far as to tell 
them that not even the angels in 
heaven, nor at that time did the Son

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



himself know the time appointed 
for His return in glory to exercise 
dominion on the earth. That knowl- 
edge He said, rested with the 
Father only. So in our assurance 
that the Lord shall come, and that 
His coming is very near, let us be- 
ware of those who undertake to set 
dates, to .designate months and 
years ; for the Lord hath posi- 
tively declared that that shall not 
b.e given to man to know, nor even 
to the angels who stand in the pres- 
ence of God. But certain signs are 
specified, and those signs are today 
ripening like the fruit in autumn- 
tide, when the fulness of summer is 
past. Who can doubt the immi- 
nence of this event, which shall be 
known as the consummation of the 
ages? 

We do well to bear in mind the 
fact that the coming of the Christ 
is not the event spoken of in the 
Scriptures by the figurative phrase 
"the end of the world". That is 
not to be the occasion of the final 
judgment. Yet when Christ comes 
He shall execute judgment; and the 
wilfully hopeless, the unregenerate 
wicked shall be destroyed. Then 
there shall be a general resurrection 
of the righteous .dead, and a change 
from mortality to immortality in the 
case of many who are living in the 
flesh at the time of His coming. 
But following the millennium, a 
thousand years of peace, shall be 
the final resurrection, in which men 
shall stand in their bodies of flesh 
and bones before the judgment seat 
of God. 

I ask your attentive consideration 
of one of the many utterances of 
the Lord concerning His coming, 
given to us in these modern days, 
as recorded in the 88th Section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants. Tn 
1832, the Lord said unto His elders 



and the Church generally, through 
the mouth of the Prophet Joseph: 

"And I give unto you a command- 
ment, that you shall teach one another 
the doctrine of the kingdom; 

"Teach ye diligently and my grace 
shall attend you, that you may be in- 
structed more perfectly in theory, in 
principle, in doctrine, in the law of 
the gospel, in all things that pertain 
unto the kingdom of God, that are ex- 
pedient for you to understand; 
# $ $ ♦ * 

"Behold I sent y,ou out to testify 
and warn the people, and it becometh 
every man who hath be.e:i warned, to 
warn his neighbor. 

"Therefore, they are left without 
excuse, and their sins are upon their 
own heads. 

"He that seeketh me early shall 
find me, and shall not be forsaken. 

"Abide ye in the liberty wherewith 
ye are made free; entangle not your- 
selves in sin, but let your hands be 
clean, until the Lord come; 

"For not many days hence and the 
earth shall tremble and reel to and fro 
as a drunken man, and the sun shall 
hide his face, and shall refuse to give 
light, and the moon shall be bathed 
in blood, and the stars shall become 
exceeding angry, and shall cast them- 
selves down as a fig that falleth from 
off a fig tree. 

"And after your testimony cometh 
wrath and indigation upon the people; 
the testimony of earthquakes, that 
shall cause groanings in the midst of 
her, and men shall fall upon the 
ground, and shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of 
the voice of thunderings, and the 
voice of lightnings, and the voice of 
tempests, and the voice of the waves 
of the sea heaving themselves beyond 
their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commo- 
tion; and surely, men's hearts shall 
fail them; for fear shall come upon all 
people; 

"And angels shall fly through the 
midst of heaven, crying with a loud 
voice, sounding the trump ,of God, 
saying, Prepare ye, prepare ye, O in- 
habitants of the earth; for the judg- 
ment of our God is come; behold, and

lo! the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out 
to meet him. 

"And the saints that are upon the 
earth, who are alive, shall be quick- 
ened, and be caught up to meet him. 

"And they who have slept in their 
graves shall come forth; for they 
shall he caught up to meet him in the 
midst of the pillar of heaven." 

I believe it all without question or 
mental reservation. And now, as I 
know that I may be criticized by 
some, who pride themselves on 
scholarship, for the child-like sim- 
plicity of my acceptance and for my 
belief in the literalness of these 
events, I say to you in paraphrase 
of the utterance of Paul : Brethren, 
I come not to you with excellency 
of speech or of wisdom, declaring 
unto you the testimony of God. For 
I am determined not to know any- 
thing amongst you save Jesus 
Christ and him crucified, the Christ 
who is to come. And I am with 
you in weakness and in fear and in 
much trembling. And my speech 
and my preaching unto you is not 
with the .enticing words of man's 
wisdom, but in demonstration of 
the Spirit and of power. That our 
faith may not stand in the wisdom 
of men, but in the power of God. 
So be it, in the name of Christ. 
Amen. 

PATRIARCH HYRUM G. SMITH. 

Testimony that the Lord lives — 
Christ's love for little children is 
boundless; they cannot commit sin, 
and are saved without baptism — 
Comfort assured to mothers who 
have lost little children — The Lord 
loves the .obedient, and such as 
have faith as a little child — More 
poignant sorrow comes from diso- 
bedience than from separation for 
a time — Let us honor the law of the 
Lord that we may claim our loved 
ones in the glorious day of the res- 
urrection. 



I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in being permitted once more 
to see this vast throng of people 
in this place of worship, and I bear 
testimony that the Spirit of the 
Lord has been with us in every ses- 
sion of this conference, both with 
those who have spoken and with 
those who have sung praises of the 
Lord, also with those who have of- 
fered prayer. The Spirit of the- 
Lord has prompted all the exercises 
of this conference thus far, and I 
pray that the Spirit of the Lord will 
be with me in my brief testimony, 
that what I may say may be so im- 
pressed upon the minds of those 
who have gathered "here that it 
may be beneficial. 

We have heard much about the 
mission and characteristics of our 
Savior and our Redeemer. We 
have heard the testimonies of his 
servants in these the last days, and 
I bear testimony to their truthful- 
ness, and would like to add my tes- 
timony thereunto. I know that the 
Lord lives, that he actually lives, 
and my faith in my Father in 
heaven is as firm and clear from 
doubt as the faith of a little child, 
knowing that his father and his 
mother are his actual guardians, 
protectors and providers here upon 
the earth. 

I have a great deal of sympathy 
and love for little children, and I 
bear testimony that the Lord loves 
little children. The instance related 
of him, where his disciples would 
forbid little children to come to him, 
he rebuked them and said, "Suf- 
fer little children and forbid them 
not to come unto me, for of such is 
the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 
19:14). 

"Listen to the words of Christ, your 
Redeemer, your Lord and your God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Behold, I came into the world not 
to call the righteous, but sinners to 
repentance; the whole need no 
physician, but they that are sick; 
wherefore little children are whole, 
for they are not capable of commit- 
ting sin; wherefore the curse of Adam 
is taken from them in me, that it hath 
no power ,over them; and the law of 
circumcision is done away in me. 

"And after this manner did the 
Holy Ghost manifest the word of 
God unto me; wherefore, my beloved 
son, I know that it is solemn mock- 
ery before God, that ye should bap- 
tize little children. 

"Behold I say unto you, that this 
thing shall ye teach, repentance and 
baptism unto those who are account- 
able and capable of committing sin; 
yea, teach parents that they must re- 
pent and be baptized, and humble 
themselves as their little children, and 
they shall all be saved with their little 
children. 

"And their little children need no 
repentance, neither baptism. Behold, 
baptism is unto repentance to the ful- 
filing the commandments unto the re- 
mission ,of sins. 

"But little children are alive in 
Christ, even from the foundation of 
the world; if not so, God is a partial 
God, and also a changeable God, and 
a respecter to persons; for how many 
little children have died without bap- 
tism. 

"Wherefore, if little children could 
not be saved without baptism, these 
must have gone to an endless hell. 

"Behold I say unto you, That he 
that supposeth that little children 
need baptism, is in the gall of bitter- 
ness, and in the bonds of iniquity; for 
he hath neither faith, hope, nor char- 
ity; wherefore, should he be cut off 
while in the thought, he must go down 
to hell. 

"For awful is the wickedness to 
suppose that God saveth one child 
because of baptism, and the other 
must perish because he hath no bap- 
tism. 

"Wo be unto him that shall pervert 
the ways of the Lord after this man- 
ner, for they shall perish, except they 
repent. Behold, I speak with bold- 
ness, having authority from God; and 



T fear not what man can do; for per- 
fect love casteth out all fear; 

"And I am filled with charity, which 
is everlasting love; wherefore all chil- 
dren are alike unto me; wherefore I 
love little children with a perfect love; 
and they are all alike and partakers of 
salvation. 

"For I know that God is not a par- 
tial God, neither a changeable Being; 
but he is unchangeable from all eter- 
nity to all eternity. 

"Little children cannot repent; 
wherefore it is awful wickedness to 
deny the pure mercies of God unto 
them, for they are all alive in him be- 
cause of his mercy. 

"And he that saith, That little chil- 
dren need baptism, denieth the mer- 
cies of Christ, and setteth at nought 
the atonement .of him and the power 
of his redemption. 

"Wo unto such, for they are in dan- 
ger of death, hell, and an endless tor- 
ment. I speak it boldly, God hath 
commanded me. Listen unto them 
and give heed, or they stand against 
you at the judgment seat of Christ. 

"For behold that all little children 
are alive in Christ, and also all they 
that are without the law. For the 
nower of redemption cometh on all 
them that have no law; wherefore, he 
that is not condemned, or he that is 
rnder no condemnation, cannot re- 
pent: and unto such baptism availeth 
nothing" (Moroni 8:8-23). 

There are many of our Latter- 
day Saint mothers who have 
mourned the loss of their litle chil- 
dren, and many mothers have felt 
that they themselves had committed 
some great sin, else their little ones 
would not be taken from them. 
Now, to such mothers let me say, 
do not accuse the Lord of taking 
vour little ones from you, nor feel 
that you have committed any great 
sin, that those little ones are taken 
from you, because the Lord loves 
little children and he will not treat 
them unkindly, nor without mercy, 
for through the blood of his atone- 
ment they shall come forth in the 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH. 



71 



morning of the resurrection with 
his Saints, and they shall be glori- 
fied according to the works they 
would have accomplished in the 
earth had they lived. I have great 
hope and great consolation in the 
blessings of our Lord, in the prom- 
ises of our Redeemer, that through 
our faithfulness in keeping his 
commandments we shall meet our 
loved ones, and especially those 
who have left this life in the time 
of infancy and innocence. Now, 
with the little children, the Lord 
loves those who keep his command- 
ments, those who obey him and 
render faith like unto that of little 
children ; and those who are obe- 
dient to his commandments will re- 
ceive his greatest love, and his 
greatest blessings. 

I am very grateful to my Father 
in heaven for the testimony that I 
have of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I know that my 
Father in heaven actually lives, and 
that he will hear and answer our 
prayers when we seek him in faith 
and in humility. I have a testimony 
of the power of faith in the earth, 
and I know that the Lord will ac- 
cept our faith when we humble our- 
selves, and that he will help us to 
exercise our faith, that his purposes 
may be accomplished in the earth 
through our efforts. 

Now, there is one thought that 
comes to me in speaking of the lives 
of little children, and of the 
bereavement that is left in the 
homes on the separation from these 
little ones. To my mind it is only 
typical, and perhaps there is some 
sadness in it, but it will be no com- 
parison to the sadness that our 
fathers and mothers will partake 
of when they come forth in the 
morning of the resurrection with 
a desire to meet their loved ones, if 



they find that they have not obeyed 
the law of the Lord which is now 
being administered, in the holy 
temples, by the servants of the 
Lord. When these fathers and 
mothers discover that they have no 
claim upon their little ones who 
have left them in this life, because 
of their own disobedience to the 
law, having heard and known the 
law, and never obeyed it, then will 
there be sorrow and weeping and 
wailing that will be sorrow indeed. 

With the moments that are left 
me this morning I urge my breth- 
ren and sisters, the sons and daugh- 
ters of the Latterday Saints, that 
we honor the law of the Lord, that 
when this glorious day of resurrec- 
tion shall come, which we know will 
come, that we may hold cla : m upon 
our loved ones in that glorious day, 
through our obedience to the law 
of the Lord that is now admin- 
istered in the houses of the Lord, by 
the authority which God has placed 
upon the earth, and the work per- 
formed by that power will be ac- 
knowledged both in this life and 
in the life to come, both before the 
resurrection and after the resurrec- 
tion. I urge this principle to be 
taught in your homes, and to be 
obeyed by the Latter-day Saints 
both young and old, and I bear you 
my testimony to the truthfulness of 
it, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
chorus : "My pilgrim staff may rest 
thee here." 

Benediction by Bishop David A. 
Smith. 

The conference adjourned until

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting of the con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall, adjoining the Tabernacle, at 
10 a. m., presided over by Elder 
Joseph E. Robinson, president of 
the California mission. The sing- 
ing was by the Richards ward choir, 
Granite stake of Zion, under direc- 
tion of Leonidas Fisher. 

The choir sang: "Send out thy 
light." 

Prayer was offered by Elder F. 
F. Hintze. 

An Easter anthem, "Christ is 
risen," was sung by the choir, the 
duet by Myrtle Docile and Joseph 
Kjar. 

ELDER DON. B. COLTON. 

(President of Uintah Stake of Zion.) 

I have been very much pleased, 
my brethren and sisters, with the 
spirit of this conference. I have re- 
joiced in the assurance that seemed 
to be in the minds of each of the 
speakers thus far concerning the fu- 
ture. In fact, to me it is a source of 
great joy in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints that 
there is a spirit of faith and assur- 
ance concerning the work of the 
Lord. I am convinced that without 
this faith and this testimony the 
work would not have reached the 
proportions that it has now reached 
in the earth. The Lord has said, 
"My doctrine is not mine, but his 
that sent me : and if any man will 
do the will of the Father he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it be 
of God or of man." It has seemed 
to me that this spirit has character- 
ized the Church since its beginning ; 
and so today, troublous as the times 
are, we face the future with a calm 



assurance that if we do our part all 
is well with reference to the future, 
notwithstanding perilous times are 
in the earth and men's hearts are 
quaking within them. I say we face 
the future with faith in God's work, 
and it will triumph. What your 
particular mission may be, and 
what mine may be, is of little conse- 
quence, so long as we do well our 
work, and trust the rest to the Lord. 
Some of us may be called upon to 
give our lives even, in defense of 
our country. We have been will- 
ing to risk our lives in defense of 
the truth, facing always the future 
with the thought that God w'll take 
care of us; and if it should so be 
that in the performance of this 
work we should lay down our lives, 
we still have the assurance we shall 
rise again. The Easter, which is 
now being celebrated, means to us 
not only that Jesus of Nazareth 
arose, but that we too shall, in God's 
own due time, arise from the dead, 
and that in the future, in the eterni- 
ties that stretch out before us, we 
shall st : ll work out all that God has 
planned for us to accomplish. It is 
a splendid thing to face the world 
with this faith. It is a splendid 
thing to face the problems of life 
with this faith. It is a splendid 
thing to know that there is a great 
leader watching over this great 
work and directing its destiny. I 
appreciate this faith and this assur- 
ance. I thank God every day of 
my life for the testimony of the 
truth, for the knowledge I have 
concerning his work. 

O how beautiful is the light given 
to the Latter-day Saints ! Not long- 
ago I was reading a book by a man 
who, I believe, is recognized as one 
of the leading theologians of the 
day. True, he accepts the doctrine 
of evolution, and in view of that he 



ELDER DON B. COLTON. 



73 



undertook the task of explaining 
the soul of man and its origin, for 
he recognized that in his great treat- 
ment he must deal with man as a 
dual character, that there is a spirit 
within man, and he must .deal with 
him in that light. So, he attempted 
in the light of science to evolve a 
theory consistent with the Christian 
belief that there is a soul within 
man, a spirit entity, a being that 
when death comes lives separate 
and apart from this body which 
walks upon the earth. This, mind 
you, was the theory of a learned 
man who had spent his life in study- 
ing theological and scientific prob- 
lems, and he said man's spirit re- 
mains, and his theory could be ex- 
plained from three different stand- 
points. We believe consistently, 
said he, that somewhere in that 
great primeval forest, when the 
monkey man first stood erect and 
walked, that God breathed into that 
monkey man who assumed the form 
that man now has, a spirit, and that 
all men descending from that first 
primeval parent have inherited that 
spirit. Or, said he, it is not incon- 
sistent to believe that not all the an- 
imal family have spirits within 
them ; that only those who begin to 
think righteously, who yearn for 
eternal life, who want to live here- 
after, have each of them a spirit 
within them, a spirit that, in some 
mysterious manner, will live after 
death. Said he, there is nothing in- 
consistent in believing that the 
wicked man who does not care to 
live hereafter will evolve nothing 
within him that survives this mortal 
existence ; and so the .doctrine of a 
limited number of spirits and souls 
is enunciated by this learned man. 
Or, said he, if any of these are 
tenable, it is easy and consistent to 



believe that at the birth of every 
man and woman, God breathes into 
their body a spirit that lives, except 
in a few cases of idiots who do not 
comprehend. In some cases, he said, 
there may be accidents, whereby the 
spirit fails to enter into those bodies 
that are thus given but who are 
lacking some of the natural facul- 
ties of man. 

When I read this learned book 
and compared these theories with 
the testimony and the knowledge 
that are given to the Latter-day 
Saints, my heart went out in thanks- 
giving, as I contemplated our belief 
in Jesus Christ, and the glorious 
truths revealed to the Latter-day 
Saints in this day through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith; for to us is 
given the testimony that we know 
of the origin of the spirit of man. 
We know that we are children of 
God, the eternal Father, not in any 
mysterious way, but actually the 
offspring, a spark, as one has put 
it, of the eternal blaze of the eternal 
Father. We were created in his 
image in a natural way, born of 
heavenly parents. Born into this 
earth, we live and die, and our 
spirits return to the God who gave 
them life, children of a great 
Father whose glory is to bring to 
pass the salvation and eternal life 
of his children upon the earth. We 
know of a surety this great truth 
that man is of a dual nature, and 
that there is a spirit within him that 
will survive forever. What a splen- 
did thing to start out with, a knowl- 
edge of our origin and destiny, that 
there may be no doubt in our souls. 
We advance each day of our lives 
with the thought that we are indeed 
the children of God, living as he 
would have us live if we obey the 
commandments he has given to us. 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



What a splendid thing to know that 
our course in life is accepted of 
God ; to know how to be initiated 
into his Church. 

Do you know how many there 
are who have accepted different 
forms of baptism from ours ? Some 
believe in sprinkling, some in pour- 
ing, some in immersion; but most 
say it is unnecessary. God has re- 
vealed the law so that we do know 
the way to enter in at the door and 
feel that we are accepted of him, 
even by baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins, administered 
by one having authority. This is 
assuredly the way God has pointed 
out for us to be members of his 
Church. So I might go on and 
point out, if time would permit, a 
number of other things upon which 
the human family are in doubt and 
are divided, that God has revealed 
to us so that we know. And then 
last, but greatest of all, God gives 
to us an assurance, a testimony of 
his own life and love for us ; and 
we know that this work is true, and 
that if we follow its teachings and 
listen to the leaders of this Church, 
not as blind followers of the blind, 
not as i,gnorant worshipers, but as 
enlightened, God-fearing worship- 
ers, we have in our own souls a tes- 
timony that "Mormonism" is true, 
and that if we live it, irrespective 
of what others may do, God will re- 
ward us with eternal life and salva- 
tion. 

There are trying times coming to 
the earth. We live in a trying time 
when men's hearts are quaking, but 
we calmly face the future with an 
assurance that if we do our duty 
God will bring us safely through. 
What is our duty at this time? Why, 
it is so plain we need not err. "We 
believe that all men are bound to 



sustain and uphold the respective 
governments in which they reside, 
while protected in their inherent 
and inalienable rights by the laws 
of such governments : and that sedi- 
tion and rebellion are crimes in 
every citizen thus protected, and 
should be punished accordingly; 
and that all governments have a 
right to enact such laws as in their 
own judgment are best calculated 
to secure the public interest, at the 
same time, however, holding sacred 
the freedom of conscience" (Doc. 
and Cov. 134:5)., As pointed out 
to us, we believe that this govern- 
ment has been established under the 
direction of God, for a great and 
mighty purpose. We believe that 
liberty is one of the inalienable 
rights of a free people. It is our 
right, it is our duty to stand for the 
right, to stand for the portection of 
that which God has given us, with 
the calm assurance that never will a 
king rule over this land, that it is 
a land dedicated to liberty and free- 
dom; but it may require acts upon 
our part to maintain and sustain 
that liberty and the blessmgs vouch- 
safed unto us by this government. 
It may require even our lives, but 
it is our duty to face the future, to 
do whatever is required of us as it 
comes to us by the light which God 
gives us ; to do our duty, let ' the 
consequence be with Him who, as 
we know, will cause this his work 
to be ultimately triumphant. We 
know that we are not to s : t supinely 
down and do nothing, because He 
had made these great promises, 
after all that he has revealed. The 
laws of the gospel we cannot refuse 
to obey when he has given unto us 
covenants and marked out plainly 
our duty. We cannot sit by and 
say that he will do it. He expects

us to walk in the light given us, and 
to do our duty well that we may be 
worthy to receive his glorious bless- 
ings. He has given unto us that we 
should preach the gospel in every 
land and clime. 

To me this is a great blessing; it 
brings a spirit of thankfulness and 
gratitude that in the gospel I can 
find a sweet assurance to lead me 
on to a better life ; that in the midst 
of the conditions we find in the 
world in the forms of government, 
God has revealed the way for me 
to walk and to be a good citizen. To 
be a good member of this com- 
munity means to be a good Latter- 
day Saint, means to be a good mem- 
ber of the Church and kingdom of 
God, and so with reference to the 
future, with this assurance, in the 
words of the poet, 

"Conquer we must, for our cause it is 

just, 
And this be our motto, in God shall 

we trust." 

This to me, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is the light of truth. I want 
to seek to do God's will, and work 
out the mission he has given me. 

"Blind unbelief is sure to err, 
And scan his works in vain; 

God is his own interpreter, 
And he will make it plain." 

Amen. 

ELDER ALMA MERRILL. 

(President of Benson Stake of Zion.) 

My heart is filled with gratitude 
to my heavenly Father for the priv- 
ilege I have of attending this con- 
ference of the Church. I am re- 
minded that coming to conference 
is becoming a habit with me. I be- 
lieve that the more we avail our- 



selves of this privilege the 
more it will become a habit 
with all the Latter-day Saints. It 
is a habit that we should acquire — 
going to meeting on the Sabbath 
day. We commence to go to meet- 
ing on the Sabbath day when we 
are small children, because our 
parents teach us that that is the 
right thing to do, and as we grow 
older in life this becomes more and 
more a habit with us ; and this be- 
ing the case it causes our faith to 
grow and increase in the knowledge 
of the gospel as we grow and ad- 
vance in years. 

We have in the Church teachers, 
who are required to visit the homes 
of the Latter-day Saints. As our 
brother who preceded me was 
speaking of the faith we have in the 
future, my mind went directly home 
to the ward teachers who are re- 
quired to visit the homes of the 
Latter-day Saints once every 
month, to teach them their duty in 
the Church, to instruct them, to see 
that there is no iniquity among 
them, that nobody is suffering, to 
teach them to pray, that their faith 
may grow from day to day, to teach 
them that we should observe the 
Sabbath day and keep it holy. The 
Lord has said that we should re- 
member and worship him on the 
Sabbath day, and assemble together 
and speak to one another as the 
Spirit may direct, that we may be 
edified in the worship of the Lord. 
We have assembled together on this 
Sabbath day in the continuation of 
our conference to worship our 
heavenly Father. To see so many 
people who have availed themselves 
of this privilege makes my heart re- 
joice, and I rejoice to be one with 
you in this vast congregation, and 
to listen to what the servants of the 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord have to say. It fills my heart 
with joy to know that we have men 
inspired of the Lord to teach us the 
gospel, to show us the way, to mark 
out for us the directions that will 
enable us to keep ourselves in tune 
with the Lord, so that we can walk 
in the straight and narrow path 
which will eventually lead us back 
to life everlasting. These principles 
have been taught all who have re- 
ceived the gospel, since we first 
heard the sound thereof. In follow- 
ing our leaders, we find we are 
walking in the path that will bring 
us to salvation in the kingdom of 
our Father. This is what we have 
sought to do, for we have a desire 
in our hearts that we may gain 
something in this life that will be 
worth while. In order to do that, 
it requires our whole time and at- 
tention. It requires the very best 
efforts that we can put forth, so 
that we will be able to perform the 
duties and labors required of us as 
Latter-day Saints. I*t is intended, 
my brethren and sisters, that we 
will seek the Lord in youth, in mid- 
dle age, and in old age, that the 
spirit of the gospel may ever burn 
in our hearts, that we can teach it 
to our children — teach them the 
principle of faith. We find that it 
requires faith in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints, to do their work 
— all the faith that we can muster. 
This we should cultivate from day 
to day that we may be able to per- 
form the duties required of us, as 
the children of our Father. If we 
continue to do this, we shall finally 
gain an exaltation in the kingdom 
of God. 

I bear testimony that this is the 
work of the Lord, that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God, raised 
up in this dispensation to establish 



the work of the Lord in the earth, 
so that faith might be implanted in 
the hearts of the children of men. 
This gospel is being proclaimed by 
the humble elders and handmaidens 
of the Lord, who are preaching to 
the world and telling them that the 
Lord has again established his work 
and is calling the children of men 
to repentance, calling upon them to 
turn from evil and walk in his 
paths. We are sending our young 
men and our daughters into the 
mission field, to preach the truths of 
the gospel to the inhabitants of the 
earth. During these troublous times, 
there are not so many of the elders 
in the field, but after these disturb- 
ing conditions are over, I presume 
there will be a call for more elders 
than ever before. So we ought to 
be prepared for the great future, 
because there is something for this 
people yet to perform, because the 
end is not yet. 

May the Lord bless and help us 
that we may be prepared for any 
event, and put our trust in God, so 
that all may be well with us. May 
the Lord assist us to serve him and 
keep his commandments, and may 
we always be found faithful and 
true to the calling whereunto we 
have been called, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"We thank thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

ELDER WM. C. PARKINSON. 

(President ,of the Hyrum Stake of 
Zion.) 

To me this is a very trying posi- 
tion, and I feel almost on the verge 
of mental collapse. I am not alto- 
gether a stranger in this position of 
standing before the Latter-day 
Saints to talk to them about the plan 



ELDER WILLIAM C. PARKINSON. 



77 



of salvation as it has been revealed 
in this dispensation ; but I never 
stand before a body of people of 
this kind but my heart is filled with 
fear and trembling. I really and 
earnestly desire your sympathy, 
faith and prayers, that the few mo- 
ments I occupy will not be in vain. 
I was born and reared in the Church 
and have attended general confer- 
ences for the last thirty-five years. 
Some people say, "I guess they 
could get along without you, Broth- 
er Parkinson, if youdon't go down 
this time." No doubt they could, 
but I want to say it is a very hard 
thing for me to get along without 
them, hard for me to feel as I 
should and keep the faith, the spirit 
of the gospel, and up with the 
times, unless I come closely in con- 
tact with the spirit of inspiration 
and revelation that emanates from 
the prophets of God. It requires 
more, perhaps, to save some men 
than it does others, and I feel I 
ought to be pretty close to the 
powers that be, and to the things 
of our Father in heaven, if I may 
successfully resist the influences of 
the world, and maintain my stand- 
ing in the Church, and finally win 
out in the great battle of life, and 
obtain the reward of the righteous. 
Perhaps the influence that first 
started me to thinking seriously, the 
most serious impression that was 
ever made upon my mind with ref- 
erence to the restoration of the gos- 
pel in this dispensation, was made 
in what was called the Endowment 
House, here on this block, when I 
listened to some words uttered by 
President Joseph F. Smith. At 
that time he was only a young man. 
But those words penetrated my soul 
from the crown of my head to the 
very soles of my feet. I have never 



forgotten them. I made a resolve 
then within myself that if God 
would give me health and strength I 
would always respond to the re- 
quirements of his servants who 
were presiding over me. So far, I 
have never refused ; so far, I have 
never hesitated. When the call has 
come to me, I have responded with 
fear and trembling, and, I think, 
perhaps to the best of my ability 
under the circumstances. 

Our first speaker referred to the 
origin of life, the final destiny of 
the human race. As far as the 
origin of man is concerned, the final 
destiny of man and the human race 
and the purpose and object of our 
mortal existence, it is something that 
troubles me but very little. I feel 
sure and satisfied that we had an ex- 
istence before we came here. I feel 
that this mortal existence through 
which we are now passing is a mat- 
ter of the very greatest importance 
in the great plan of final develop- 
ment, I feel that the sphere beyond 
is the reward of eternal life to those 
who are faithful, exaltation, power, 
principalities and blesssings and 
privileges beyond our power to un- 
derstand. And still, there are many 
problems yet in human life that 
have not been solved, but there is 
this one thing that I am absolutely 
assured of, and that is, that the 
God of heaven has come to the 
world and he has spoken. Jesus 
Christ, his Son, also appeared in 
this dispensation, and has given 
to us the power of the holy priest- 
hood, the authority to officiate in 
the name of God, and restored the 
truths of the everlasting gospel, 
line upon line, principle upon prin- 
ciple, here a little and there a little, 
until all of the principles we pos- 
sess of the great plan of redemption 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have been revealed for our benefit. 

There are many sacred and very 
encouraging promises made in this 
book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
that should be a source of comfort 
and consolation, in this period of 
our existence, when there is so 
much trouble and sorrow and un- 
easiness in the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men all over the world. 
This truly is a time when men's 
hearts are failing them for fear, 
for something they know not what 
is comirfg on them ; and if during 
these terrible times the righteous 
hardly escape, where shall the wick- 
ed and the ungodly appear ? 

The Lord promised, in the early 
history of his Church, that if his 
people would keep his command- 
ments, he would fight their battles, 
he would preserve them, and he 
would take care of them. If we 
keep his commandments, are we 
entitled to have verified to us these 
promises that God has made? In- 
dividually perhaps we have erred, 
gone astray, done many things that 
are careless and indifferent and out 
of harmony with our profession as 
Latter-day Saints. But I am grate- 
ful to say, and I find great consola- 
tion in the fact, that the Church 
itself, with the heads of the Church, 
have always marched on in the line 
of progress, have always kept the 
faith ; they have never forsaken the 
principles of revelation that have 
come from the Lord in this dispen- 
sation. They have mainta : ned them 
with all their might and with all 
their strength, from the beginning 
up to the present hour. Thank God 
for that. Individuals may not be 
entitled to these promises, but I feel 
that God, our Eternal Father, will 
not forsake his people and his 
Church, and when it comes to the 
great struggle that is now going on 



in the world, I think we have no 
fear whatever as to the final out- 
come of this nation, of this govern- 
ment, or the destiny of this nation 
and this government. The history 
of the past has been pointed out, the 
various events and conditions be- 
fore they occurred, almost as clearly 
as they could be presented after 
they have happened, and there are 
predictions yet to be fulfilled in the 
future that are just as clear, and I 
have no doubt that they will be ful- 
filled also. There is to be a time 
come when the Zion of our God 
shall be built upon this continent, 
and the law shall go forth from 
Zion and the word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem. Then all nations 
shall yield obedience to the laws of 
God. Sometimes we wonder ; I 
hear men say who profess to be 
Latter-day Saints, they wonder why 
our prophets are not having reve- 
lations that are being written like 
those contained in this book. How 
is it that for so many years, reve- 
lations have not been written and 
published to the world? I have 
long since come to the conclusion 
that we have all the revelation now 
that we are willing to live up to, 
and a great deal more, and I do not 
know but we have all that we really 
need, and I cannot see for my part 
the necessity under these conditions 
why the Lord should be giving us 
more revelation. You must remem- 
ber that in the beginning the Lord 
was dealing with a boy, with a 
young man, only a youth, unlet- 
tered, and who knew nothing about 
his great purposes in the great plan 
of redemption which he designed to 
bring about, and he came and in- 
structed him, and sent angels and 
messengers time and time again and 
taught him until every branch and 
authority of the priesthood was re- 



ELDER WILLIAM C. PARKINSON. 



79 



vealed and bestowed upon him. He 
came and gave comfort and conso- 
lation through the revelations. 
Why, a prominent man scarcely 
joined the Church but he would go 
to the Prophet and want to inquire 
of the Lord what he wanted him to 
do. That was frequently done, and 
men were called by absolute reve- 
lation to do this, that and the other. 
But after a while the great plan of 
salvation was revealed, the organ- 
ization of the Church was estab- 
lished. There were prophets and 
apostles in our midst who had been 
chosen by revelation, and they were 
endowed, with power from on high, 
to bear the authority of the holy 
priesthood and to minister unto the 
people, and they have been doing 
it ever since, and they have carried 
with them the power and the spirit 
and the mission of their calling. 
And if we would yield obedience to 
them and listen to their teachings, 
we would have no need to fear for 
the final result and as to whether 
the Lord would take care of this 
people as he has promised. 

I thank the Lord we live in these 
isolated valleys today. I do not 
believe there is a better people on 
earth than the Latter-day Saints 
who are gathered in these valleys 
of the mountains, where we find 
greater freedom, greater liberty, 
and still we will have all the trials, 
I imagine, that we are able to stand. 
We are to be tried as gold seven 
times purified in the furnace. 

I was talking with one of the 
bishops recently with reference to 
the reports that are sent in annu- 
ally from the various stakes all over 
the Church. He called my attention 
to the fact that sometimes even gov- 
ernment officials come into the pre- 
siding bishop's office to get infor- 
mation with reference to these re- 



ports. They want to know about 
the death rate and the reason for 
death, and something about our 
marriages and divorces, etc. They 
inquired, he told me, a few days 
ago what was the cause of death 
among our people, whether it fre- 
quently occurred from venerial dis- 
eases, or from diseases that are 
recognized as being caused by un- 
righteous living and by impure and 
immoral habits or manner of life. 
They were surprised to learn that 
there was scarcely any of that kind, 
scarcely any at all. Then again, 
they inquired into the marriage sta- 
tistics, and found very few divorces. 
I do not suppose there is a people 
in the world, and especially in a 
land where it is so .easy to secure 
divorces as in the United States, 
that have so few as are found 
among the Latter-day Saints. I 
have discovered that those who are 
married in the temples are seldom 
divorced. Most of the divorces 
among our people are those who 
have not been married in the temple. 
We sometimes talk about this kind 
of marriage. We refer to it in 
speaking to our young people, and 
we advise them to go to the temple 
and be sealed for time and eternity, 
and try to impress upon them the 
importance of it. Why, it is the 
only marriage law in the world that 
has been revealed from heaven. It 
is the eternal order of marriage. 
Some people when they read the 
great revelation found in this book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, 132nd 
section, imagine that it refers only 
to plural marriage, when the fact is 
that it refers to the eternal or celes- 
tial order of marriage, including the 
plurality of wives, which has been 
done away. But this celestial order 
of marriage, this divine system of 
marriage, is something that should ' 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be taught to our children. I am al- 
ways grieved and very much sur- 
prised when I find our young people 
drifting away and marrying outside 
of their own people and outside of 
the temple. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
know the gospel is true. I rejoice 
in it. I thank the Lord that I live 
in this dispensation. I thank the 
Lord that I am numbered with the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice in the 
fact that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
came forth, and had the courage 
and the manhood and the spirit to 
withstand the world, and bring 
forth the message which he de- 
livered unto us. I am thankful that 
the priesthood which was bestowed 
upon him by heavenly messengers 
has been handed down without a 
break, and we still have that di- 
vine authority and the right to act 
in the name of the Lord. I could 
wish we might act more intelli- 
gently, more readily, more univer- 
sally, because practically all of us 
have the priesthood, and we should 
use it. The priesthood means ser- 
vice, and there is always plenty to 
do. It is hard to find men and 
women enough to carry the respon- 
sibility of presiding and helping 
others. 

I have enjoyed this conference, so 
far, and I have no doubt but we 
will enjoy it to the end. May the 
Lord bless us all. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN. 

(President of the Bingham Stake.) 

I am very grateful for the 
teachings of this conference, and 
the few moments that I shall oc- 
cupy, I desire that the words I may 
say may be in harmony with the 
spirit of the conference and the 
teachings that we have received. 



T have listened with a great deal of 
interest this morning to the testi- 
monies of our brethren who have 
spoken to us the sensible and prac- 
tical suggestions concerning our 
duties as Latter-day Saints. J 
sometimes think that if the Latter- 
day Saints could put into practice in 
their lives a very small percentage 
of the instructions that we receive, 
from time to time, from the ser- 
vants of the Lord, there would not 
be very much the matter with us. I 
was especially impressed yesterday 
morning with the opening discourse 
of President Smith, wherein he was 
pointing out to us as members of 
the Church our duties, not only in 
the Church but as citizens of this 
great government of: which we form 
a part, and he called our attention 
to the crisis that is now confronting 
this nation and the trying experi- 
ences we are having, and he tried to 
impress upon the Latter-day Saints 
their duties to God and as citizens. 
I was reminded by the remarks of 
President Smith, that good citizen- 
ship and loyalty to the government 
does not consist altogether in wear- 
ing the uniform. President Smith 
called our attention to some of our 
temporal affairs as Latter-day 
Saints. He endeavored to encour- 
age us in the cultivation of the soil, 
and I, being a farmer, the proposi- 
tion interested me more perhaps 
than it would some others. I have 
always been engaged in the occupa- 
tion of tilling the soil. I was im- 
pressed with the counsel of Pres- 
ident Smith, and we know that the 
most serious thing that is now con- 
fronting the nations that are en- 
gaged in th : s deadly conflict is the 
question of providing food for the 
people, not a question of winning 
battles in the western part of 
France and other places, but it is a 



ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN. 



81 



question of feeding the armies, and 
it is a question of feeding the peo- 
ple, producing things that are 
necessary to sustain life. And so 
seriously have our brethren viewed 
this question that they have offered 
through the Trustee-in-Trust from 
the funds of the Churah, a reward 
for the quorums of the lesser priest- 
hood, and other organizations of the 
ward and of the priesthood, that 
they may enter into contest, to see 
which organization or quorum of 
priesthood can produce the greatest 
amount of food upon a small tract 
of land. If I remember right, 
there is a reward of $1,000 offered 
by the Church for the Church or- 
ganization that can produce the 
greatest number of bushels of 
wheat on a tract of five acres of 
land, a reward of $500 for the next 
greatest number of bushels, and I 
believe a thir.d prize of $250. And 
similar prizes are offered to the or- 
ganizations that can produce the 
most bushels of marketable potatoes 
on an acre of land. These things 
should stimulate. They should not 
only stimulate us to endeavor to 
secure these prizes — of course there 
is always pride in the contest for 
superiority, — but it seems to me 
it should impress us with the fact 
that the Prophet of the Lord has 
admonished us to be industrious, to 
cultivate the waste corners of our 
farms, to more intensely prepare 
our soil, look after our crops, give 
attention to the proper seasons of 
planting, and the selection of the 
soil, and everything' that goes to in- 
crease the products of the soil, so 
that we may aid in th : s great work 
of feeding humanity. Now you 
know we have become, in a meas- 
ure, the allies of some of those 
Euporean nations. If we are not 
their allies we have become engaged 



in the great conflicts that they are 
engaged in, and their troubles will 
be our troubles, and we should see 
to it that we partake of the spirit 
of good citizenslrp, and we should 
hearken to the counsel that is given 
to us by our leaders. 

Our brethren have said this 
morning that in the counsel of the 
servants of the Lord lies the path 
of safety. Now I need not dwell 
upon that, because the Latter-day 
Saints are thoroughly converted to 
it. If "Mormonism" stands for any- 
thing, it stands for good citizenship, 
loyalty and right government, and 
we can only be loyal Dy taking these 
things seriously because we know 
not today what tomorrow may 
bring. Some of those who are the 
best informed, some of those who 
believe they know the most about 
it, predict some very startling sur- 
prises for us, and we do know, my 
brethren and sisters, that we are 
confronted with a crisis that this 
nation has never been confronted 
with before. 

Now let us assume the responsi- 
bility that belongs to us as Latter- 
day Saints. Not all of us will wear 
the uniform; not all of us will go 
to the front ; but many of our boys, 
many of our young men. will enlist 
in the army, will respond to the call 
of the President of the United 
States, and they will go to the front 
and fight the battles of this coun- 
try, shoulder to shoulder with the 
young men of other states. And 
there may be a place for us ; there 
may be a need for older men, we 
cannot tell. I am reminded of the 
patriotism of our brother, B. H. 
Roberts, and of his willingness to 
serve his country, of his desire to 
go out and encourage the young 
men in their duties as citizens. Now, 
my brethren, let us observe the 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



counsel that is given us by the 
Prophet of the Lord, and by the 
brethren whose right it is to coun- 
sel with us, and let us live our re- 
ligion. Brother McKay yesterday 
delivered to us a powerful discourse 
on the necessity of observing the 
Word of Wisdom, that we might 
not bring down the standard of 
manhood among the Latter-day 
Saints. Our brother who has just 
sat down has spoken to us about 
the minimum death-rate and the 
maximum births among the Latter- 
day Saints, and I can bear witness 
with him, that there is a minimum 
of divorces amongst our people who 
are married in the temple. They 
seem to be impressed with that sa- 
credness of marriage, to the end 
that they are not so likely to become 
dissatisfied, not so likely to murmur, 
and they are impressed with the di- 
vinity of that eternal marriage 
covenant. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
let us remember our responsibilities. 
Let us observe the Word of Wis- 
dom. Let us not destroy the man- 
hood of this Church by engaging 
in habits of dissipation, the drink- 
ing of liquor, the use of tobacco, 
the taking of tea and coffee and en- 
gaging in those things that the Lord 
has said are not good for us ; and if 
We will do this, we will be blessed. 
We need not fear the outcome. We 
need not take any concern as to 
this crisis. We can face the future 
with that .degree of confidence and 
assurance that the Lord is with us, 
and that we are his people. He 
has guided and directed the affairs 
of this Church and this people from 
the very beginning, and I have all 
the confidence in the world that the 
Lord will not desert us, if we do 
not desert the Lord. 

This is a great and a mighty work 



that we are engaged in. It has for 
its purpose the saving of our souls, 
the rendering of service for the sav- 
ing of the souls of others, and if 
we shall be faithful and true to the 
covenants that we have made with 
the Lord, it will be well with us. I 
trust that we may have the disposi- 
tion to keep the commandments of 
the Lord and hearken to the coun- 
sel that is given us from time to 
time. I realize that this is a great 
conference. It has been an occa- 
sion when our brethren, the ser- 
vants of the Lord, have felt more 
concern for the salvation of the 
Latter-day Saints than usual. We 
have received so many good in- 
structions concerning our duties, 
and those things that we ought not 
to do, those things that we ought 
to leave alone, and also those things 
that would be good for us to do ; 
and if we will hearken and let our 
spirits enter into this work, we 
shall be blessed. May God grant 
that we may have a disposition to 
do this, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH. 

(President of the Blackfoot Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters: Like 
you, I have rejoiced in the teach- 
ings of this conference, and can 
bear testimony of the spirit of in- 
spiration that has directed all of the 
teachings to which we have ii.it- 
ened; and while I stand before you 
for a few moments I earnestly de- 
sire an interest in your faith and 
prayers because, unless I may re- 
ceive that assistance which cometh 
from on high it will be sureiy im-

possible for me to add anything that 
would be of an edifying character 
to you. I feel keenly the responsi- 
bility which rests upon me in hav- 
ing been called upon to address this 
large assembly at this time upon the 
principles of life and salvation, 
though it be but for a few moments. 

I have rejoiced in the remarks 
which have been made here this 
morning, that is, I have rejoiced as 
much as I possibly could in view of 
the fact that I have been trembling 
every moment looking forward to 
the time that I would be called upon 
to address you. I know that "Mor- 
monism" is true. I know that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the 
living God, and that his successors 
in the presidency have equally been 
prophets of the same living God. 
They have been endowed with the 
same divine authority and, from 
time to time, as they have been 
called upon or felt impressed to 
speak to the Latter-day Saints, they 
have given unto us the mind and 
will of God the eternal Father. 

Reference has been made to the 
fact that the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ as delivered through 
the teachings of the Church author- 
ities today has to do with temporal 
things as well as spiritual things, and 
I would like to say that any religion 
that may be professed by any people 
in the world today that does not 
teach with reference to temporal 
things as well as spiritual, is not 
worth the name of being called the 
religion of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

We understand by revelation that 
the soul of man comprises the body 
and the spirit of man, and the Lord 
desires to save the soul of man, and 
that means not simply the spirit but 
the spirit and the body of man. 

Some years ago it was my priv- 
ilege and pleasure to labor in Aus- 



tralia as a missionary. There was 
a gentleman there who was handed 
some discourses delivered by the 
general authorities of the Church, 
at these general conferences, and in 
speaking to me sometime later re- 
garding the .discourses he had read, 
he made this remork : "Mr. Duck- 
worth, one thing that has impressed 
me, with reference to the teachings 
that are delivered in your general 
conferences by the general author- 
ities of your Church, is this, that 
they are essentially of a practical 
character ; they deal with the every 
day problems of life, and they 
are not related solely to the spirit- 
ual concern of your people." It 
made a deep impression upon my 
mind at the time, and I have often 
remarked about it since, that the 
teachings that were given by our 
general authorities in the gather- 
ings of the Saints relate to the tak- 
ink care of the body just as well as 
the taking care of the spirit of man. 
They teach us how to take care of 
our bodies ; they teach us that beau- 
tiful law known as the Word of 
Wisdom. They teach us that we 
should be clean in our bodies, that 
we should keep our bodies pure and 
in such a way that we may be in a 
fit condition for the enjoyment of 
the Spirit of our Father, for he will 
not dwell in unclean tabernacles, 
and it is just as essential that we 
shall keep our bodies clean as that 
we shall keep our spirits clean. 

With this teaching also, we are 
impressed with the fact that it is 
binding upon us that we shall do our 
part in saving the souls of others ; 
and as Latter-day Saints, if we hold 
this gospel to ourselves, seeking 
only to save ourselves, we shall not 
have acceptance of the great mis- 
sion that God has given us here 
upon the earth. It is our duty to so 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



live that we shall save the souls of 
others. We are surrounded by 
many that are not members of the 
Church. I come from a town where 
four-fifths of the people are not 
members of the Church, and I 
claim it is the duty of the Latter- 
day Saints living in that town to 
preach the gospel that they them- 
selves have received, to the world ; 
and when I say preach it, I mean 
not by speaking of it only, but by 
living it in their every day life. I 
want to bear testimony to this fact 
that if we would be held up in 
esteem by those not of our faith, 
those whose souls may be full of 
prejudice, if we want to preach the 
gospel in the most effectual man- 
ner, we should do so by example as 
well as by precept, exemplifying the 
fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
"By their fruits ye shall know 
them," is an illustration of what I 
refer to. 

It may not be amiss to refer to 
another thing in my experience. A 
few years ago an old gentleman 
who had come from Great Britain, 
who was a musician and had set out 
to make a tour of the world to- 
gether with a young lady accom- 
panist, happened to stay in our 
town for some weeks. In the 
course of his visit, my wife and I 
became very well acquainted with 
him ; and on one occasion we in- 
vited him to our home to spend the 
evening and have supper with us. 
At that time we had become habitu- 
ated to having our family prayers 
in the evening, before the evening 
meal, following the counsel that 
was given me by President Ly- 
man, on one occasion, who said, 
"we always have family prayer be- 
fore our evening meal, and I want 
to counsel you to do the same 
thing, and I want you to teach that 



to the stake over which you pre- 
side." I did so, for I have always 
found it best to carry out the coun- 
sels of those who preside over us, 
and who have the right to give us 
counsel as they may be inspired to 
do by the Holy Spirit. President 
Lyman said, "if you wait for the 
evening prayer until bed time, the 
older boys and girls may be out at 
a dance, at a picture show, or in- 
dulging in some other form of 
amusement ; the smaller children 
get sleepy and retire to bed, and the 
result is that the prayer that is had 
may not be a family prayer." On 
the occasion I was speaking of, 
when the meal had been prepared, 
my wife beckoned me to come into 
the room. She said, "What are 
you going to do about the family 
prayer this evening?" I said, 
"What is the matter?" Said she: 
"Here is this Professor ; he does 
not make any profession of re- 
ligion ; he has faith in a Supreme 
Being but he belongs to no Church. 
It may be very embarrassing for 
us, if we go right along with our 
regular custom of having family 
prayer." I said in reply, "If he is 
an honorable gentleman, I am sure 
he will take no exception, for I 
have absolute faith in 'Mormon- 
ism,' and I am not ashamed of it 
before any man or woman in all 
the world, and my feeling is that 
we should go right along as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, no matter who may 
be our visitors." 

We returned to the dining room, 
and when the time came, all the 
chairs were turned with their backs 
to the table. I spoke to the gentle- 
man and said, "Professor So-and- 
so, you understand that we are Lat- 
ter-day Saints. We are about to 
participate in a custom that has 
been practiced from the beginning 



ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH. 



85 



amongst our people. We believe 
it to be right, and that custom is 
that before retiring to rest we ap- 
peal to the Throne of Grace, upon 
our bended knees, for the blessings 
we need through the night. We 
do so again in the morning before 
we go forth to the labors of the day, 
and we will appreciate it if you 
will join with us." He knelt down 
with us without a moment's hesita- 
tion and took part with us. He 
then saw that we asked the bless- 
ing upon the food. After that 
whenever he came to the evening 
meal he always took part in the 
family prayer. Sometime later it 
came to about the time for him to 
leave. His accompanist had not 
then visited us. This time she 
came also, but they did not come 
until after the evening meal had 
been partaken of. We spent sev- 
eral hours in enjoyable entertain- 
ment. When the time came for 
them to take their departure we 
rose from our seats and, to my sur- 
prise, he walked across the room to 
where I was standing, and he held 
out his hand and said, "Mr. Duck- 
worth, before we leave this house 
I would like to make a request. I 
want to leave this house with the 
same good spirit that I have al- 
ways felt here, and I will appreci- 
ate it if you will allow us to kneel 
with you in family prayer." I was 
overcome for the moment, but as 
soon as I regained my composure 
I said, "All right, we will do so," 
and we knelt down just as we had 
done several times before when he 
was with us, although the young 
lady merely knelt on one knee. This 
was as far as her prejudice would 
permit her to go. They joined with 
us in family prayer. They left Black- 
foot. Sometime later they came 
back again, and as the result of 



that first beginning, they became, 
and are today, some of the most 
friendly investigators I have had 
in all my experience. I have learned 
from other experiences of like 
-character that it always pays to be 
a Latter-day Saint at all times and 
under all circumstances and before 
all people. Whenever we become 
vascillating, whenever we fail in 
our duty before others we always 
lose in their estimation ; but when 
we are Latter-day Saints, consistent 
in our daily lives, they think more 
of us, and we all preach the gos-' 
pel in the way that I have indicated. 
May the Lord bless us, that we 
may understand and appreciate 
what "Mormonism" is, and may 
we have his Spirit to actuate our 
lives, I ask, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of the California Mission.) 

With you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I have rejoiced in the testi- 
monies borne by our brethren this 
day, and I know that your souls 
have been uplifted by the praise and 
melody of song, that your hearts 
have been centered upon the things 
of the eternal world. One of our 
brethren, President Austin, re- 
marked that never on the earth in 
our history has there been so much 
concern manifest relative to the fu- 
ture. We all appreciate the fact 
that we are confronted with a crisis, 
yet the feeling of equanimity mani- 
fested among our people is most ad- 
mirable and praiseworthy. From 
whence does it come? From the 
conviction that we are the very 
children of God, that we have not 
descended from any anthropoidal 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ancestors — ourang outang, chimp- 
anzee or any kind of monkey, but 
our spirits were born of eternal 
parents before the world was, and 
by adoption we come into his family 
and kingdom in this age and gen- 
eration. There is no thought nor 
care manifested upon the part of 
any other creature of our Father. 
He shapes our destiny. They follow 
out the impress of a superior will ; 
their wants are provided for; they 
are suited to their habitat and time 
of living. They have their com- 
' panions and their natural affection 
for them, but aside from this there 
is nothing in them, or within them, 
that is devout, that looks to God, 
that has a yearning after immortal- 
ity and eternal life. Aside from 
man there is no comprehension of 
abstract truth, not even in the most 
intelligent of all our Father's crea- 
tures. It remains for his children 
alone to have the capacity and pos- 
sibility of worship, the desire to 
worship. It remains for his chil- 
dren, let them be ever so humble, 
the barbarian of our country, the 
Hottentot of Africa, or the so-called 
heathen of all foreign lands, with 
the Christian, to entertain the hope 
of eternal life and seek after it. 
These impressions come not alone 
from the emotions nor from earthly 
things, but they come from above. 
The soul finds expression in praise 
and song and prayer, seek : ng unto 
the Father for life eternal, seeking 
to know how to live and how to do 
that we may reap the crown of 
eternal lives. The wondrous hymn 
so beautifully rendered by this 
splendid choir, betokening the res- 
urrection of the dead, the "first 
dawn of the day" when Christ took 
up his body from the tomb and the 
angels bearing witness that he had 
risen, must give joy unto you. The 



learned savants of the day, who 
have sent their boys to the front 
"somewhere in France," have been 
giving time and attention to this 
fact, "Does the dead soldier live, 
and does he return to earth?" Sir 
Oliver Lodge, Crookes, Lombrozo, 
Stead, and many others of the rank 
and file of England's nobility, en- 
gaged in deadly conflict, have each ~f 
in turn given their testimony to this 
end, that the spirit of man does not 
die, but is made alive for ever 
more; that the soldier dead live, 
and return again to their former 
friends as well as the places that 
they have frequented. This is the 
testimony of the scientists in face 
of the dread things that have come 
to them in the world's war today. 
I want to bear witness that the same 
spirit of trust, the same spirit of 
hope that is within the true Chris- 
tian, permeates those who are here 
today. So it was with the Latter- 
day Saints when earthquake and 
fire destroyed the great city of the 
Pacific coast. There was a peace 
that came into the souls of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints there that "passed 
the understanding of men." There 
was no hysteria ; there was no fear 
manifest by trembling or excite- 
ment, but a confident trust in the 
providences of Almighty God that, 
living or dying, all was well with 
them. I saw the same spirit mani- 
fest when four thousand people 
were driven out of the republic of 
Mexico. I heard their songs on the 
plains of Hachita and Columbus, 
and in the city of El Paso : 

"Though deepening trials thr.ong your 
way, 
Press on, press on, ye Saints of God, 
Ere long the Resurrection day 
Will spread its light and truth 
abroad." 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON.

"I will go where you want m.e to go, 
dear Lord, 
Over mountain or plain or sea, 
I will say what you want me to say, 
dear Lord, 
I will be what you want me to be." 

Those songs were sung by our 
good people under strenuous and 
pathetic circumstances with the 
same spirit that actuated the 
Prophet Joseph when he returned 
to his friends and his enemies after 
he had set his face to the west, — 
hoping, perchance, to find a respite 
from persecution and from the trial 
and a haven of refuge long denied 
him in the east, — -that spirit that 
enabled him to say, "I go like a 
lamb to the slaughter, yet am calm 
as a summer's morning, and my 
conscience is void of offense to- 
wards God and all men." Men and 
women who hold these sentiments 
have found the precious pearl of 
great price, and they are not upset 
nor filled with doubts and fears and 
misgivings by the things that try 
the hearts of the men of the world 
who know not the Christ nor have 
kept his commandments. 

I want to speak briefly of the 
lives of two men of ancient times. 
Solomon, the great king of the 
chosen people of Israel, seated upon 
his throne at Jerusalem, then upon 
the highway of the commerce of 
the world, between Damascus in the 
east and Alexandria in the west, 
or the Valley of the Nile ; whose 
ships went forth to all marts of 
trade, who gathered the precious 
things, the dye-stuffs, the rugs, the 
spices, the silver and gold, and the 
precious stones of all sections of the 
world, who said that he had ac- 
quired more wisdom and knowledge 
than any of his predecessors, added, 
"It is all vanity, all vanity and 
vexation of spirit." He had wan- 



dered in his old age after false gods 
and strange women, and the spirit 
of truth, the precious "pearl of 
great price," had departed from 
him, and left him standing in his 
own strength alone ; and shorn of 
his hope as was Sampson of his 
locks, — there was nothing worth 
living for, and in his bitterness he 
wrote that "it is all vexation of 
spirit." There was another prince, 
the greatest amongst his fellows, 
whose riches were greater than any 
others of his time, to whom God 
had been gracious and kind until 
the enmity of the adversary was 
aroused, and he criticized God for 
the care he had bestowed upon Job. 
And the Lord gave Job into satan's 
hands. He took from him all of his 
possessions, all the things that men 
prize in worldly affairs ; he de- 
stroyed his brave sons and fair 
daughters, and he was left sitting 
in the ashes of a once happy home 
clothed upon with the most humil- 
iating of diseases. The only com- 
fort given him was that he might 
scrape his diseased flesh with a 
potsherd. His comforters up- 
braided him, that he had been un- 
mindful of his obligations to God; 
and his own wife, who had been 
given to him to comfort and cheer, 
turned upon him and said, "Why 
do you not curse God and die?". 
Did Job feel like Solomon, that life 
was vain and evil, that it was vexa- 
tion of spirit, and that "all was 
vanity of vanities?" No, because 
of him having taken hold of the 
plan of life and salvation, and hav- 
ing in his heart the testimony of 
Jesus, he said : "Though he slay 
me, yet will I trust him," * * * 
"for I know that my Redeemer 
lives, and in the latter day he shall 
stand upon the earth, and though, 
after my skin, worms destroy this 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



body, yet in my flesh shall I see 
God, and mine eyes shall behold 
him for mine own self and not an- 
other, though my reins be consumed 
within me." Have you the faith of 
Job? Have you the faith of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith? Can you 
meet every condition without fear, 
without asking favor, with a con- 
science void of offense towards God 
and all men? If so, all is well with 
you, and you will come off victori- 
ous. And though we may die for 
our country, our flag and religion, 
God, out of the maelstrom of war 
shall bring the millennium of peace, 
when Christ shall rule and reign, 
and the dead shall be brought forth ; 
for just as surely as Isaiah proph- 
esied of ancient Israel, "Thy dead 
men shall live, together with my 
dead hody shall they arise. Awake 
and sing, ye that .dwell in dust ; for 
thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and 
the earth shall cast out the dead," — 
just so truly has the Psalmist David, 
poet and king, declared that his soul 
should not be left in hell,- — so surely 
shall the dead arise, clothed upon 
with immortality and eternal lives, 
and then shall be brought to pass 
the fulfilment of the scripture, "O 
grave, where is thy victory, O 
death, where is thy sting?" All 
swallowed up in the newness of life, 
and the fact that we are God's, and 
shall be his forever to rule and 
reign throughout the endless ages 
of eternity with Christ, our God 
and King. With him we shall arise 
and inherit kingdoms and powers, 
principalities and dominions. This 
is the ultimate condition that will be 
attained to by those who love the 
Lord and keep his commandments. 
No wonder that he who entertains 
such thoughts strikes hands with 
the Infinite, and does not fret over 



the mundane things of this earthly 
life. 

May the Lord keep us in his love, 
and finally place upon our heads 
crowns of eternal righteousness, I 
ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem : 
"Lord in heaven." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Newel K. Young, principal 
of the North Sanpete stake theo- 
logical seminary. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

An open air meeting was held in 
front of the Bureau of Information 
building at 10 a. m., Walter P. 
Monson, president of the Eastern 
States mission, presiding. 

The congregation sang: "The 
happy day has rolled on." 

Prayer by Elder Francis M. Ly- 
man, Jr. 

The congregation sang: "We 
thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of the Eastern States 
Mission.) 

It is indeed a pleasure to me to 
have this opportunity of meeting 
with you, my brethren and sisters, 
in this open air meeting. If the 
people of the world could only see 
the splendid audience that has gath- 
ered today to receive the word of 
the Lord, they could no longer 
charge that the Church is failing 
•in numbers, or in interest pertain- 
ing to the doctrine that has been re- 
vealed. With the missionary who 
is in the world and with the Lat-

ter-day Saint at home, as well, we 
have learned to regard all seasons 
as summer, every place a taber- 
nacle ; and I know of nothing more 
glorious than to meet with the chil- 
dren of our Heavenly Father un- 
der the canopy which he has spread 
over our heads. I sincerely trust 
that you will pay close attention to 
the speakers and remain, although 
standing is tiresome. Why should 
not the Latter-day Saints stand for 
an hour or two and listen to the 
word of the Lord, when we expect 
it of those who are not of the 
Church? 

ELDER URIAH G. MILLER. 

(President of the Cottonwood Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I most 
sincerely and deeply crave an in- 
terest in your confidence, and your 
faith and prayers, for the few mo- 
ments that I shall stand before you 
upon this important occasion. There 
never has been a time in my life 
when I have felt more in need of 
the assistance of the Spirit of our 
heavenly Father than now, for I 
recognize that all of you assem- 
bled together in this great audience 
have come to conference for the 
purpose of receiving some word of 
inspiration to take to your homes 
and carry with you individually, or 
to disseminate to those among you 
with whom you are called to labor 
in the various wards and stakes of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

I realize that these conferences 
are of very great importance to 
you. Those who attend the meet- 
ings from the beginning to the end 
of conference realize this to a 
greater extent than if they attend 
only one or two sessions of the con- 
ference. 



I am very grateful, personally, 
my brethren and sisters, for a mem- 
bership in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have 
enjoyed a great many privileges 
and blessings that have come to me 
as a member of the Church. Like 
many who are assembled here upon 
this occasion, I was born in the val- 
leys of the mountains. No doubt 
there are many men and women in 
this congregation who received the 
gospel in the nations of the earth, 
and I recognize that there is a vast 
difference between the men and 
women in this congregation who 
received the gospel in the nations 
of the earth, and the boys and the 
girls, or the men and women, who 
received the gospel in the organized 
wards and stakes of the Church. 
We who have been born in the 
Church have practically automatic- 
ally become members of the 
Church. Our fathers and moth- 
ers have been interested deeply in 
the work, and we have arrived at 
the age of eight years without over- 
much knowledge of the gospel. We 
have been baptized by the servants 
of the Lord, had hands laid upon 
us for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, and in a certain sense almost 
have become automatically mem- 
bers of the Church. Its teachings 
have then rested upon us as we 
have grown. Years and experience 
have brought unto us the power to 
receive deeply within our hearts the 
same kind of testimony of the gos- 
pel that the members of the Church 
who have accepted the gospel in 
the. nations of the earth have re- 
ceived. I am very grateful, my 
brethren and sisters, to Jmow that 
we who are born members of the 
Church, so to speak, are placed in 
a position by which that testimony 
can be given to us, and are also

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



able to say and to know beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that God lives, 
that in this day and age of the 
world in which we live, he has es- 
tablished his Church upon the 
earth. 

There are many responsibilities, 
my brethren and sisters, resting up- 
on us, as members of the Church, 
not only as presiding men and 
women in the Church, but as mem- 
bers : we are to be careful in our 
lives to set before the world an ex- 
ample that will be worthy of emula- 
tion, and to adopt principles that 
have been revealed from heaven, 
that will make its better citizens of 
our country, and better members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I trust that as mem- 
bers of the Church we shall live 
worthy of the cau5e that has been 
established, and endeavor to over- 
come the weaknesses of our own 
flesh and the difficulties that sur- 
round us, in the way of temptations 
presented to us in our various walks 
and avocations of life. I trust that 
we shall endeavor to observe the 
Word of Wisdom, particularly to 
overcome the habit of using cigar- 
ettes, tobacco in any form, and in- 
toxicating liquors. 

I am very grateful indeed to 
know that those states in this inter- 
mountain region that have not 
passed laws already governing the 
sale of intoxicating liquors will 
have laws go into effect soon. We 
who are living in the State of Utah 
are grateful to know that soon a 
prohibition law will go into effect 
to help us in conquering the liquor 
traffic that is with us at present, and 
overcome the use of intoxicating 
liquors. 

In my experience, my brethren 
and sisters, I do not know of one 
thing that I abhor quite so much as 



the use of intoxicating liquors. All 
my life I have been thrown directly 
where I have observed the effects of 
the use of intoxicating liquor. The 
misery that has come to men and 
women with whom I have come di- 
rectly in contact and known inti- 
mately has caused an abhorrence in 
my soul for the use of liquor. I 
hope that the men and women who 
are here who have boys and girls 
will use every effort to teach them 
that the use of intoxicating liquor 
is detrimental to their welfare as 
well as contrary to the teachings 
that God our heavenly Father has 
revealed unto the children of men. 
Misery has been brought into the 
world through the use of intoxicat- 
ing liquors beyond the power of the 
human tongue to describe. No 
doubt many of you, my brothers 
and sisters, have witnessed these 
things in your lives. You have 
seen, perhaps, a gray haired mother 
unfortunate enough in her life to 
have to stand on the door step and 
wait for the father to return, or a 
son who has gotten away from the 
shadows of the roof and come in 
contact with the influence of the 
world, and who, before he returns 
to his home, has been overcome 
with intoxicating liquors, to come 
home and fall into the arms of the 
mother who has been tearfully 
praying that her boy would not be 
overtaken by that sin or other sins 
directly connected with it. 

Temperance is an important 
thing in our lives, because it builds 
up the individual — and the strength 
of the Church and country is as the 
strength of the individual. If we 
could have a race of men and 
women who had never touched in- 
toxicating liquor, who knew not the 
evils of the use of tobacco, nor what 
the taste of tea or coffee is, how

strong would that generation of 
men and women be in our midst, as 
well as in the nation and the world 
at large! We have striven, un- 
doubtedly, for that end, and I am 
very much convinced of the fact 
that we are greatly growing in that 
direction. There may be some who 
believe that we are not achieving 
a great deal along those lines, but 
personally I believe we are gaining 
ground, and will be able to estab- 
lish the truth in the hearts of the 
boys and girls with whom we come 
in contact in our homes and in the 
organizations and otherwise, that it 
is not good for them to indulge in 
these forbidden things. We are 
able to convince the older men and 
women who, in their younger days, 
adopted the use of tobacco or intox- 
icating liquors, that it is wrong for 
them and wrong in the sight of God 
to continue in the use of these 
things. And consequently, one step 
after another, one effort after an- 
other, we are able to accomplish 
a great deal along this line. I am 
led to the belief, as I come in con- 
tact with the people, that we are 
gaining ground, and that the Word 
of Wisdom is being more thorough- 
ly established amongst us. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that we may enjoy ourselves and 
have the peace and the blessings of 
the gospel of the Redeemer within 
our souls. The comforts of the 
world are great blessings to have. 
I believe it would be a good thing 
if we could enjoy the riches of the 
world. It has never been my priv- 
ilege, thus far in life, to enjoy them 
to any great extent, but as I come 
in contact with other men and 
women who enjoy the temporal 
blessings of the world, I am con- 
vinced it would be pleasant to pos- 
sess them. But, my brethren and 



sisters, it would be better for us to 
be in rags, at the door of starvation, 
than not to possess within our 
hearts, the sweet, peaceful, direct- 
ing influence that comes from our 
heavenly Father — that gift and 
blessing of the Holy Ghost prom- 
ised unto the children of men if 
they would be obedient to the laws 
and ordinances of the gospel. 

I testify, my brethren and sisters, 
that God has again restored the 
gospel to the earth, that he has be- 
stowed the Holy Ghost upon all 
who have obeyed the gospel's first 
requirements. The Holy Ghost is 
given to the children of men, to be 
a teacher and a comforter unto 
them, to guide them unto eternal 
truth, and to assist them when trials 
and tribulations come upon them, 
and to give unto them the peace 
and the happiness that their souls 
crave. 

I ask that the blessings of God 
may be upon us, that we shall be 
able to become better men and 
women, and to carry out in our 
lives a little more closely the things 
which we have covenanted with 
God to obey. I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 

(President of the Deseret Stake.) 

Notwithstanding I have spent 
three years of my life upon a for- 
eign mission, calling men unto re- 
pentance and bearing witness to 
the divinity of the work of the 
Lord, and that I am the father of 
fourteen children, one of my boys 
being now in a foreign clime pro- 
claiming this same gospel, yet I am 
undergoing for the first time in 
my life, right now, the experience 
of speaking to a congregation in the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



open, and I tremble in every part 
of my body. I feel and sense the 
need of help and inspiration, and I 
pray that the Lord will he my 
helper and my inspirer. 

I cannot hope to rise to any 
heights to proclaim the beauties of 
the everlasting gospel, but I can 
express my gratitude unto the Lord 
that he has blessed me with ears to 
hear, with a heart to understand, 
with willing feet to follow, and will- 
ing hands to serve, and has im- 
pressed upon my soul the veritable 
fact that in this the dispensation of 
the fulness of times he has really 
spoken from the heaven and re- 
stored the everlasting gospel. 

I sometimes think that it is im- 
possible for us as Latter-day Saints 
to quite sense fully the wonderful 
facts that have actually transpired ; 
the facts that the Lord did speak 
with Joseph the Prophet face to 
face, that he did introduce his Son 
Jesus Christ, and invited Joseph to 
hear him ; that he did teach him 
through the ministering of angels, 
and that Moroni, for four succes- 
sive years, did teach the prophet as 
a father would a son — except on a 
greater scale, as a servant from the 
Almighty, from the heavens above, 
would teach one of the children of 
the Lord, to prepare him for this 
great work. 

I have often wondered how mar- 
velous it must appear to all when 
they think of this wonderful mes- 
sage. Though the prophet had lis- 
tened to the voice of the Lord, 
though he had listened to the voice 
of the Savior, though he had been 
taught by the angel Moroni, yet 
so far he never ventured to organ- 
ize the Church. He never ran be- 
fore he was told to go, he never 
spoke without the voice of author- 



ity. And when the Lord did re- 
veal unto him that the priesthood 
should be restored, and when he 
did manifest unto Joseph and Oli- 
ver that John the Baptist should 
come, then what a wonderful work 
Joseph set about to do ! Do we 
appreciate it that he who, at his 
death, carried the keys of baptism 
by immersion, that that very being, 
resurrected, revived again, should 
come to men living in this dispen- 
sation and place his hands upon 
their heads, call them fellow ser- 
vants, and restore unto them the 
priesthood of Aaron, which holds 
the keys of the gospel of repentance 
and of baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins ? And that 
he should give unto them the prom- 
ise that it should not be taken again 
from the earth until the sons of 
Levi should offer again an offer- 
ing in righteousness unto the Lord ? 
Still no organization ! Then Jo- 
seph waited for the promised visita- 
tion of the very men who under the 
hands of the Messiah himself had 
received their commission, Peter, 
James and John, who should come 
and upon the banks of the Susque- 
hannah river, ordain them to the 
Melchizedek priesthood. Then they 
received authority and power, and 
then, under the direction of the 
Lord, the right time came and the 
Church was organized. Then men 
were commissioned. And that is 
the reason that we have the cour- 
age to say that there is no other 
church under heaven, good though 
it may proclaim itself, having the 
whole and the complete truth, and 
the authority to preach it and to 
officiate in the ordinances of the 
gospel. That is the bold message 
that we deliver to this world, with- 
out apology, for when the Lord 
spoke he said that his Church was 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 



93 



the only Church with whom he was 
well pleased. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
this is my knowledge, your knowl- 
edge, and that which enables us to 
carry conviction wherever we go. 
We speak in no uncertain terms, for 
the Lord has spoken to our soul, 
has given us a testimony, so that 
we do not have to say, we hope, we 
believe. We do not proclaim a 
philosophy of men, but we speak 
with certainty, and say that through 
the mercy of the Lord the gospel 
has been restored, we bear witness 
that we have a testimony of its 
divinity. 

Now that these perilous times are 
upon us, are we moved ? are we dis- 
tressed? One of my sons walked 
up to me the other day and said, 
"Father, what about this 'Reply to 
the call of your country' ? What 
shall I do? I do not want to be 
sent, I would rather go." I said, 
"My son, look at your mother, look 
at your father, look at your broth- 
ers and sisters and all, and sense 
what you are asking. Then do not 
expect from me that I shall ever 
offer a word of discouragement to 
you, for you live in this blessed 
land of liberty. Here we have had 
our home, here we have had peace, 
here we are blessed ; and as a citi- 
zen you must answer, and answer 
understanding^ what it means. Go 
if you feel you must go, like your 
brother abroad proclaiming the gos- 
pel. Go in the same spirit, if you 
feel it. Go when you are needed, 
go where you are needed." 

Those are my convictions, this 
is my spirit, this is my feeling to- 
day : I love my fellow men. In 
the early days of a mission, when I 
was in the Netherlands and could 
not speak nor understand, and I 



had left my family and all — when I 
walked the streets of a great city 
and looked into the faces of those 
honest people, I thought, Oh, if I 
could but open my mouth and speak 
unto you what I feel, deliver unto 
you the message that I carry, how 
happy I would be ! 

We do not have to go off to Hol- 
land, to any country. Even in the 
stake where I preside, the Deseret 
stake, men are gathering by the 
hundreds, thousands, strangers 
within our midst, who have never 
heard this gospel yet. I commend 
unto you this little thought : One 
man, coming into our midst, sat 
beside a good bishop, and a good 
minister said to that man, "Are you 
letting your children go to this 
'Mormon' Sabbath School?" 

"Yes," he said, "they are going." 

The minister said, "Beware. Do 
not have them tainted with this 
'Mormon' spirit." 

He said, "I have lived beside this 
man and watched him every day 
since I have come. Whenever I 
want a wagon it is available. When 
anything is to be brought from the 
store to the country, that good man 
proffers to bring it for me. These 
little lessons carry conviction to me 
that the bishop is a good man. I 
know nothing of that man but 
good. I hear nothing from my chil- 
dren but good. Call it 'Mormonism,' 
call it whatever you choose. The 
name will not affect it. The fruits 
are good." 

So I say, our mission is not only 
to proclaim, but to live as witnesses 
who have received the truth, and 
who love the truth. And if we live 
the truth, my brethren, and sisters, 
no man can come within the circle 
of our influence without being im- 
pressed with the fact — somewhat

after the same spirit as the disci- 
ples, when the Master met them on 
the way to Emmaus, and when they 
walked with him. The Scripture 
says, "Their eyes were holden," 
and when he came in and broke 
bread with them, then they beheld, 
and it was revealed unto them pos- 
itively who it was. Then, in coun- 
seling with them, they said, "Did 
not our hearts burn within us while 
he talked with us?" So it will be 
with you, so it will be with me, so 
it will be with every man who, hav- 
ing received the light, walks in the 
light. 

As the beloved disciple John said 
concerning Jesus, "Ye who have 
received the light walk in the light, 
as he walked in the light," and his 
spirit will characterize you, and its 
influence will be felt wherever you 
go. The Lord bless us to live 
righteously, and living so our lives 
and good works will be seen by 
others, that they shall be led to 
glorify God. 

It is my joy to bear testimony 
that I know the truth of these 
things without a doubt. I thank 
God for the teachings of a good 
father and a good mother. I have 
never been beset with doubt, but I 
can stand up before my own chil- 
dren as my father did before me, 
and say, "I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God, and that you 
are members of the true Church. 
Live it as your grand-father lived 
it. Live it as I hope you see your 
father live it. Live it as sure as 
the authorities of the Church live 
it, and be happy forever more." 

God bless us and help us to do 
it, I pray in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER ¥M. H. SMART. 

(President of Duchesne Stake.) 

I crave not only your attention, 
but your faith and prayers, that my 
words may be seasoned with truth, 
and that my strength may be equal 
to this outdoor meeting occasion. 

It is said that out of the abund- 
ance of the heart the mouth speak- 
eth, but we do not always speak 
those things of which our lives 
speak. Sometimes we dream of be- 
ing full, but wake and find ourselves 
empty. And so some principles that 
may be nearest our heart may be 
farthest from our active lives. What 
I say may be principles that I should 
like to incorporate in my life, but 
in which I find myself weak. 

The preceding speaker announced 
that he is the father of fourteen 
children, and he admonished us to 
follow in the footsteps of our fath- 
ers and grandfathers, and so forth. 
I am impressed with this counsel, 
and in connection with it I remem- 
ber one of the commandments that 
was given to ancient Israel and re- 
inforced and brought forth unto 
this modern Israel, "Honor thy 
father and thy mother: that thy 
days may be long upon the land 
which the Lord thy God giveth 
thee." I sometimes think that we 
take too short a view of this com- 
mandment and the blessing which is 
to follow obedience thereunto. 

I used to think when I was a boy 
that it meant that I might live long 
in this particular life, upon this 
land, and be possessed and blessed 
with long life here; but in later 
years another thought has come to 
me. It has come with the thought 
of my dual parentage, one parent- 
age the Father of my spirit, the 
other parentage the father of my 



ELDER WILLIAM. H. SMART. 



95 



body — the Father of my spirit and 
the father of my body having en- 
tered into a copartnership in this 
dual soul composed of the body and 
the spirit. If I would live long upon 
the land which the Lord my God 
hath given me, I must not only be 
obedient to the father of my fleshly 
tabernacle, but I must also, and 
first, be obedient to the Father of 
my spiritual tabernacle. 

I have felt that the very founda- 
tion stone of happiness and pro- 
gress here and hereafter, is to be 
in harmonious corespondence with 
my temporal and spiritual environ- 
ment ; and the first thought, the first 
thing to be discovered, is this rela- 
tionship to these dual fountain 
heads, to observe the harmony and 
correspondence that I should hold 
with reference to the fountain heads 
of my being. When I have recog- 
nized that thought in the spirit of 
obedience, I am in a condition to 
honor them and listen to their com- 
mandments. 

The Father of my spirit, through 
h : s Son Jesus Christ, using the 
Prophet Joseph Smith as a medium 
of communication between heaven 
an.d earth, has given unto us this 
mighty principle with reference to 
law: "There is a law, irrevocably 
■decreed in heaven before the foun- 
dations of this world, upon which all 
blessings are predicated ; and when 
we obtain any blessing from God, 
it is by obedience to that law upon 
which it is predicated. " That is 
written in the law, in section 130 of 
the Doctrine and Covenants. 

Then again, in Sec. 88 :42, 
the Lord says, "And again, verily I 
say unto you, he hath given a law 
unto all things by which they move 
in their times and seasons." All 
things ! That embraces man, the 
animal kingdom at large, the min- 



eral kingdom, the vegetable king- 
dom. Further, the Lord says in 
connection with this subject, "Even 
the earth abideth the law of a celes- 
tial kingdom, for it filleth the meas- 
ure of its creation." In other words, 
it is obedient to the law of its crea- 
tion, the law of its fountain head. 
It transgresseth not the law, there- 
fore it shall be sanetified. 

Why shall it be sanctified? Be- 
cause it transgresseth not the law of 
its being. "Yea, notwithstanding it 
shall die, it shall be quickened again, 
and shall abide the power by which 
it is quickened, and the righteous 
shall inherit it." Who shall be the 
righteous ? The men and the wom- 
en who, like the earth, recognize 
the law of their being, their foun- 
tainhead, for notwithstanding they 
shall die, all souls shall rise again 
as spiritual bodies. 

If we are to live upon the land 
a long time, which the Lord our 
God hath given us, we must abide 
the law given to control our being, 
just like the earth ; for it says the 
earth shall be resurrected, shall be 
redeemed, -because it abideth the 
law, and the righteous shall in- 
herit it. 

God has given unto his children 
a code of laws : faith, repentance, 
baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sins, by those who have 
authority, to administer in the or- 
dinances of his kingdom, the laying 
on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, the law of tithing, the law 
of consecration, the law of the seal- 
ing ordinances in his house, wherein 
man and woman are sealed for time 
and all eternity, and all the various 
cardinal principles of the gospel. 
These are the laws of our being, 
unto which we must subscribe if we 
would inherit this earth when it has 
lived its law, the celestial law, that 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we may live upon it many, many 
years, even until the time when 
Christ shall present it unto the 
Father as a finished work in the 
end. Therefore, we recognize the 
law of God, we recognize our spir- 
itual Father as we recognize our 
temporal father — and not only rec- 
ognize, but feel and live the law. 
We recognize God as the owner of 
ourselves, the owner of this earth 
form that we are allowed to live 
upon and cultivate, and bring up 
to a high state of' cultivation. 

With regard to the ownership of 
God as well as the brotherhood of 
man, let me present a thought that 
came to me when I was presiding 
over the Eastern States mission 
many years ago. I remember it, 
because President Monson, who 
presides over this meeting now, was 
there. It was when President 
Lorenzo Snow quickened the prin- 
ciple of tithing, that will redeem us 
from our temporal degradation and 
save us temporally. I was wonder- 
ing how I could diffuse among the 
people of that mission this principle 
of tithing, that we should conse- 
crate a part of our earnings, tem- 
poral blessings, unto the Lord. I 
was sitting at my desk pondering 
over this principle, and I turned 
to a hymn that I had never noticed 
before, and it went through me like 
an electric shock. It revealed the 
principle of the ownership of God 
and the stewardship of man, and I 
thought, if the elders of this mis- 
sion and the Saints can recognize 
that principle, then the law of tith- 
ing is easy — no more a sacrifice, but 
a blessing in disguise : 

"The silver, gold and precious stones," 
Thus saith the Lord, "ar.e mine, 

The cattle on a thousand hills 
I own by right divine. 



"The forests, rich-stored mountains, 
plains, 

The fertile valleys, too, ■ 
The earth and all that is therein 

Are but my righteous due. 

"And men themselves beLong to me — 
They hold from me a lease 

Of health and strength, and even life, 
Which at my word may cease." 

Then why should men so much desire 
To seize on all they see — 

Cheat, covet, and appropriate, 
To self so greedily? 

The Saints have learned a purer faith; 

They own the Lord's just claim; 
They're stewards o'er what they 
possess, 

And hold it in his name. 

Their flocks and herds and lands and 
wealth, 
Their wives and children dear, 
Their all, themselves, they bring to 
him; 
Thus they his rights revere. 

I want to say to this congrega- 
tion that if we will recognize the 
ownership of God our eternal 
Father, the author of our spirits, 
and recognize and honor our earth- 
ly fathers, even back to father 
Adam — recognize them in their re- 
spective spheres, in their ownership, 
and remember that Latter-day 
Saints never become of age, know 
not the year of twenty-one — and 
that through the endless ages of 
eternity we are our spiritual Fath- 
er's children and our temporal 
father's. All that we do brings dis- 
honor to their names, or honor to 
them in our rigtheous obedience to 
law, and will exalt us in the king- 
dom of our God. 

Th : s is the end of the keeping of 
the law pertaining unto our tem- 
poral and spiritual beings. May God 
enable us to keep the laws he has 
given unto us. I pray in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER LARS P. OVESON. 

(President of the Emery Stake.) 

My beloved Brethren and Sisters 
and Friends: I rejoice exceedingly 
this morning in having the privilege 
of meeting with you in this open air 
meeting, not that I covet the place 
that I occupy at the present time, 
for I can assure you, like one of 
the former speakers, that I tremble 
in every part of my being, but I do 
rejoice in the testimony of the gos- 
pel of the Son of God, in having 
membership in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in 
being associated with the people of 
God. 

When I look upon this vast con- 
gregation, realizing that that Tab- 
ernacle is full to overflowing, that 
the Assembly Hall likewise is 
crowded, it tells me that the Church 
of Christ is growing, that we are 
increasing in numbers. When I 
first set foot in Salt Lake valley as 
a little boy, Salt Lake City was then 
as one of our villages is now out 
in the country. In the few years 
that have passed, it has grown to 
be a mighty city that is envied by 
people in all parts of the world. Our 
desert country has been made to 
blossom as a rose. Towns, villages, 
and cities have sprung up in the 
various parts of this intermountain 
region. 

When I look upon this picture, 
my brethren and sisters, and realize 
that it is the outgrowth of the work 
of the Lord, and that magnificent 
organization which was effected 
eighty-seven years ago last Friday, 
with only six members, the Prophet 
Joseph Smith an instrument in the 
hands of God in organizing this 
great and mighty work, which has 
grown and increased until it has 
become one of the great common- 



wealths of the world, it gives me 
joy to realize what the Lord is do- 
ing for his people ! 

It is not only the people gathered 
here in the valleys of the mountains, 
from Canada to Mexico, from Cali- 
fornia on the west to Colorado on 
the east, but in the foreign mission 
fields scattered abroad in the earth. 
When we realize that there are 
more than 75,000 members of the 
Church scattered in the foreign 
mission fields of the world, and 
when we see the records that come 
to us of the work that is being ac- 
complished in the mission fields, the 
faithful Saints scattered abroad in 
the world, it sometimes makes me 
wonder if we, the Church assem- 
bled here in the valleys of the 
mountains, could not take a lesson 
from the scattered Saints in the 
nations of the earth. 

I observed recently, in a bulletin 
sent from the Presiding Bishop's 
office to the various stakes of Zion, 
stating to some extent the work be- 
ing accomplished in the mission 
field and the faithfulness of the 
Latter-day Saints, that the tithing 
being paid by the Saints in the mis- 
sion fields sets a pattern for some 
of us here in the valleys of the 
mountains. When I realize that in 
one of the mission fields more than 
$9 per capita had been paid by the 
people in that condition, I could not 
help but realize that it set an ex- 
ample for the Saints in my stake of 
Zion, and I believe in many others. 

My brethren and sisters, the gos- 
pel has been revealed for the salva- 
tion of the human family. The Lord 
has been merciful and kind to his 
children, has offered unto us a plan 
whereby we may eventually return 
into his presence, may prepare our- 
selves to go back and .enjoy that 
glory and exaltation which he has 



98 



General conference. 



in store for his children. He has 
gathered this people from the na- 
tions of the earth, has taken us one 
of a city and two of a family, and 
we have been gathered here in this 
goodly land. Today, when we look 
at the conditions surrounding us in 
the European nations and in the 
countries of the world, we must ac- 
knowledge that we are in the most 
favored spot upon all the face of the 
earth, here in the tops of these 
mountains, a place of safety, of 
refuge, where we enjoy peace and 
happiness, where we can enjoy 
prosperity. 

This has all come to us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, through the bless- 
ings of the gospel. What manner 
of people should we be? How 
should we appreciate these favors 
that the Lord has so abundantly 
given us? Does it not behoove us 
to be faithful and true to every 
covenant that we have made with 
our Heavenly Father? to observe 
to the best of our ability every law 
and requirement that has been 
made of us? We must acknowl- 
edge that they have all been given 
not for the Lord's benefit, but for 
us his children, for our develop- 
ment, advancement, growth, that we 
may prepare and qualify ourselves 
here in this school of experience, 
in this mortal state, in this proba- 
tion, to go back and enjoy his glory, 
his presence, and the happiness 
that will come to those who are 
faithful and true. 

I do not desire, my brethren and 
sisters, to take up your time any 
further this morning, but I have a 
testimony of the truthfulness of the 
gospel, and I thank God for it, and 
I desire to lift my voice whenever 
an opportunity is given to me, to 
bear that testimony to mankind, for 
I know that the Lord lives, I know 



that Jesus is the Christ, that he is 
the Redeemer of the world. I know 
that Joseph Smith is a prophet, and 
that we see before us every .day of 
our lives the fruits of his great mis- 
sion and ministry upon the earth. I 
know that the servants of the Lord 
who have the control and who di- 
rect the Church at the present time 
are men of God, and I can testify 
to you of the truthfulness of the 
statements that were made yester- 
day in our meetings, that they are 
men of honor, of integrity, men of 
faith ; and if we will hearken unto 
their counsels and admonitions from 
time to time, we will prosper and 
increase both spiritually and tem- 
porally. 

That the blessings of the Lord 
will continue to be over us, and that 
the spirit of peace and of love and 
of harmony may grow and increase 
in the midst of the Latter-.day 
Saints, is my humble prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian.) 

This is perhaps the first time in 
the history of the Church that a 
president of the Eastern States 
mission has presided over a general 
meeting at the headquarters of the 
Church. It brings to our remem- 
brance the infancy of the Church 
and the thought that in the Eastern 
State? was the cradle of "Mormon- 
ism," and that we have presiding 
over this meeting, today, a man 
who in the presidency of a mission 
succeeds such distinguished per- 
sonages as Brigham Young, Wil- 
ford Woodruff, John Taylor, Par- 
ley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Samuel 
Brannan and a number of other 
prominent men, who at one time

or another have presided over the 
Eastern States mission. 

We will remember that it is with- 
in the present boundaries of that 
mission that the so-called "Mor- 
mon" hill, the Hill Cumorah, is lo- 
cated, and that the Church was or- 
ganized in that region of country 
eighty-seven years ago ; it was also 
in these eastern lands that John the 
Baptist, and Peter, James and John 
appeared and gave to us the holy 
priesthood. 

It may be proper for me to call 
your attention to what the Eastern 
states .did for the Church at an 
early date. When I mention the 
state of Vermont, you will, of 
course, remember that Joseph 
Smith the prophet and his brothers 
Hyrum Smith and Samuel H. Smith 
were born there, and so also were 
the late Presidents Brigham Young 
and Heber C. Kimball. There were 
many natives of Vermont who be- 
came very prominent factors in this 
Church and helped indirectly to lay 
the foundation of this great com- 
monwealth in the valleys of the 
mountains. Did you ever think of 
such men as Newel K. Whitney 
(one of the first bishops of the 
Church), Apostles Luke S. John- 
son, Wm. Smith, Lyman E. John- 
son, Albert Carrington, Erastus 
Snow, Hyrum Page (one of the 
eight witnesses to the Book of Mor- 
mon), and others who first saw day- 
light, so far as life in mortality is 
concerned, in the Green Mountain 
State? 

Then, when you think of the state 
of Massachusetts you can remem- 
ber such men as Thos. B. Marsh, 
Willard Richards, Chas. C. Rich, 
Ezra T. Benson, John F. Boynton, 
and Franklin D. Richards, all of 
whom are prominently known in 
Church history. You can also think 



of the first patriarch of the Church, 
Joseph Smith, Sen., and Bishop Ed- 
ward Partridge, who were natives 
of the state of Massachusetts. 

Next you can think of the state 
of Connecticut for Wilfor.d Wood- 
ruff and Orson Hyde, and you think 
of New Hampshire in connection 
with Amasa M. Lyman and Patri- 
arch John Smith who were born in 
that state. 

Let me next draw your attention 
to the state of New York, where 
such men as Oliver Cowdery, Peter 
Whitmer, Jun., and Martin Harris 
(all witnesses to the Book of Mor- 
mon) were born. You can then call 
to mind Apostles Lyman Wight, 
John E. Page, David W. Patten 
(the first prominent martyr in the 
Church in this dispensation), Par- 
ley P. Pratt, Geo. A. Smith, Orson 
Pratt, Jedediah M. Grant and 
Daniel H. Wells, who were all born 
in the great Empire state. 

If you cross over the boundary 
line into Pennsylvania, you are led 
to think of Sidney Rigdon, Bishop 
Edward Hunter, and such witnesses 
to the Book of Mormon as David 
Whitmer, Christian Whitmer, Jacob 
Whitmer, and others who were 
born in that state. 

I desire to attract your attention 
to the fact, also, that from the City 
of New York, in 1837, went forth 
the first Latter-day Saint mission- 
aries to Great Britain. Further- 
more, I desire to remind you that 
it was in the City of New York that 
Parley P. Pratt first published his 
famous Voice of Warning, one of 
the first books printed in the early 
clays of the Church — a book that 
perhaps has done more good and 
made more converts to "Mormon- 
ism" than any other single book 
written in the early days of the 
Church. It was also in the City of 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



New York that Parley P. Pratt, in 
1837, first introduced the fulness 
of the gospel; and, twenty years 
later, in the year 1857, he left that 
city to go to his martyrdom in the 
distant state of Arkansas. 

We may also remember that the 
port of New York was the place 
where the first Latter-day Saints 
immigrants from Great Britain 
landed. Heber C. Kimball and the 
other missionaries who went to 
England, in 1837, commenced to 
preach the restored gospel in Pres- 
ton, and thence went into the re- 
gions round about. They preached 
several years, however, before the 
emigration of Saints to America 
commenced; but when it did com- 
mence it is recorded in Church his- 
tory that on the 6th .day of June, 
1840, forty-one souls (members of 
the Church) landed in the City of 
New York, having crossed the At- 
lantic Ocean in the sailing vessel 
Britannia, in charge of Elder 
John Moon. This marked the first 
emigration of Saints from the old 
world to America in an organized 
capacity. In that same year ( 1840) 
the ship North America brought 
about two hundred Saints from 
Great Britain. The next year 
(1841) eight or nine ships arrived 
from Europe with Saints hound for 
Nauvoo, 111. The emigration con- 
tinuing, eight ships sailed in 1842, 
five in 1843, five in 1844, three in 
1845, and one in 1846; all these 
vessels landed immigrating Saints 
at New York and New Orleans 
hailing from Great Britain. After 
that the immigration was tempor- 
arily suspended because of the ex- 
odus of the Saints from Nauvoo to 
these mountains, and when it was 
reopened, in 1848, New Orleans was 
chosen as the landing place for the 
immigrants from Europe. This 



continued until 1855, when the 
route was changed again, and since 
that time nearly all our immigrants 
from Europe have landed in the 
City of New York,except a few who 
landed at Philadelphia and Boston; 
of late years a number of ships 
with Saints on hoard have also end- 
ed the voyage at Montreal, Canada. 

We should not forget that it was 
from New York also that the ship 
Brooklyn in the year 1846, set 
sail and on her long voyage, doub- 
ling Cape Horn, and in due course 
of time arrived at San Francisco, 
Cal. — no, there was no such place 
at that early day; it was the small 
village of Yerba Buena. Among 
many other things which the 
Brooklyn company of Saints 
brought with them to California 
was a printing press which had 
been used by Samuel Brannan (one 
of the presidents of the Eastern 
States mission, and one of the pred- 
ecessors of Brother Monson here) 
for publishing a paper in New 
York called the New York Mes- 
senger. On this printing press, 
which was taken around on the 
ship Brooklyn to Yerba Buena 
(afterwards San Francisco), was 
printed the first real newspaper in 
California, the so-called California 
Star. From among the immigrants 
who made the voyage mentioned in 
the ship Brooklyn came also some 
of the first founders of Utah. 

I will here add that several years 
after the presidency of Samuel 
Brannan in New York, Apostle 
John Taylor, who presided over the 
Eastern States mission, published a 
noteworthy periodical called The 
Mormon in the interest of the 
Church. For about three years The 
Mormon was the distributor of 
light and truth in the Eastern states 
so far as the fulness of the gospel 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



101 



was concerned. Its motto was : 
"It is better to represent ourselves 
than to be misrepresented by 
others." 

I have felt impressed, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to draw your atten- 
tion to these historical facts this 
morning, in connection with this 
outdoor meeting. Perhaps it is be- 
cause I am more historically in- 
clined than most people in the 
Church that I cannot overlook the 
fact that on this occasion the mem- 
ories of events connected with the 
earliest days of the Church are 
brought to our very doors, and that 
we have the eastern country, the 
New England States, the states of 
New York and Pennsylvania, to 
thank for a great many things 
which we at the present time enjoy. 
In the providences of Almighty 
God it so happened that many 
prominent men, prophets and apos- 
tles and others, who have figured 
conspicuously in this Latter-day 
dispensation, were born in those 
states of our great and glorious re- 
public which border on the Atlantic 
Ocean. It contradicts the assertion 
frequently ma.de that Palestine has 
produced all the prophets that ever 
lived and that to Palestine has come 
all the angels that ever brought a 
message from heaven to the inhab- 
itants of the earth. That assertion 
is not true. In the Eastern states 
of our own country and elsewhere 
the Lord has raised up prophets and 
apostles in our own day, and in the 
great state of New York God our 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer, appeared in a glori- 
ous vision to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; angels also came and visited 
America, just as literally as they 
ever visited Palestine in olden times. 

May God help us, my brothers 
and sisters, to appreciate the gos- 



pel and its accompanying gifts and 
blessings, as restored in our day to 
the earth, which gospel must ulti- 
mately be- preached in all the world. 
Long ago our elders would have 
preached it in all the countries on 
the earth, if the inhabitants had 
been willing to receive their testi- 
monies. 

I trust that the time is not far 
distant when the pure gospel of 
Christ, first proclaimed by divine 
messengers on the Hill Cumorah, 
in the village of Fayette and on the 
banks of the Susquehanna River, 
may be heard in every land and 
clime, and that all nations, kin- 
dreds, tongues and people may have 
an opportunity to listen to that gos- 
pel as it has been restored to the 
earth in these latter days. Amen. 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON. 

(President of the Eastern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I deem it a great pleasure to have 
this opportunity of standing before 
you a few minutes in this open air 
meeting. I rejoice in the spirit un- 
der which the remarks have been 
given. My heart has been thrilled 
by the precious truths which have 
been uttered. 

When I think of the great re- 
sponsibility resting upon one who 
occupies this position, I tremble in 
my own weakness, and yet the Lord 
has said that he will support those 
who are in h : s service. For upward 
of eight years I have served in the 
ministry, and I know that the Lord 
will not desert those who will place 
their entire dependence upon him. 
I wonder if we as Latter-day Saints 
realize how precious the truth 
which we have received is. To me 
there is nothing so precious and 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



true as the gospel of Jesus Christ 
and the testimony which seems to 
have been horn into my nature. 
Knowing full well that it has been 
bequeathed unto me by my noble 
parentage. I thank God always 
that my father and my mother had 
the courage of their conviction.; to 
turn their backs on the old world 
and come as pioneers to this west- 
ern land and help make these 
valleys the pleasant abode which 
they now are to the Latter-day 
Saints. 

The gospel is not merely a code 
of ethics resulting from the fer- 
vent thought of man, neither is 
the organization of the Church a 
mere congregating together of a 
few who would like to proclaim 
those ethics to the world, but the or- 
ganization ,of the Church was di- 
vinely inspired and men were com- 
missioned to go forth into all the 
world to preach the gospel to every 
creature, and to baptize those who 
will be baptized, and to save the 
meek and the lowly of the earth. It 
is not the wise — those who are 
proud and puffed up in their own 
conceits, — that will listen to the 
testimony of our humble mission- 
aries, but it is the meek and the 
humble and those who hunger and 
thirst after righteousness. They are 
they who are being filled. I want 
to enjoin upon the Latter-day 
Saints that you turn not away from 
the spirit and power of this great 
work, for I want to bear testimony 
to you that no greater blessing has 
ever come to this earth and been 
bestowed upon the heads of men 
and shared in blessing by the wom- 
en, than the priesthood and author- 
ity of Almighty God. We sang, 
"We thank thee, O God, for ' a 
prophet" — I believe every true Lat- 
ter-day Saint is thrilled with that 



beautiful hymn, but I thought while 
we were singing the third verse, 
there may be some who have sung 
it time and time again without get- 
ting its full meaning : 

"We'll sing of his goodness and 
mercy; 
We'll praise him by day and by 
night, 
Rejoice in his glorious gospel, 
And bask in its life-giving light; 

Thus on to eternal perfection 
The honest and faithful will go; 

While they who reject this glad mes- 
sage 
Shall never such happiness know." 

The Lord revealed to the prophet 
Joseph Smith, as is recorded in the 
eighty-eighth Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, that the gos- 
pel is his celestial law revealed to 
terrestrial beings, which, when ap- 
plied to our lives uplifts us from 
the degradation of the world and 
plants us on a higher level and in 
closer relationship with God our 
eternal Father. 

"And bask in its life-giving 
light." Perhaps the author of the 
hymn had in mind what Paul said 
in the 15th chapter of his first letter 
to the Corinthians, "There is one 
glory of the sun, and another glory 
of the moon, and another glory of 
the stars : for as one star differeth 
from another star in glory, so also 
is the resurrection of the dead." I 
would not have you believe that the 
gospel brings blessings only in the 
future life, or rather in the world 
to come, but that the blessings of 
the gospel are to be realized this 
very minute and this very hour, 
and will purify your lives, that 
when you shall have laid off this 
mortality, you will rise to greater 
heights than would have been pos- 
sible for you had you not obeyed 
the truth as it has been revealed. 



ELDER WALTER P. MONSON.

Now to the illustration of Paul : 
if the gospel is the celestial law, and 
the celestial kingdom is likened unto 
the glory of the sun, let us not think 
only of the light which the sun dif- 
fuses, but think of the power and 
influence of light without which 
nothing can grow. We might liken 
the light of the sun to the intelli- 
gence of man. There is something 
else besides the light of the sun. 
There is the warmth which coaxes 
the tender plant from the cold earth, 
raises it in the teeth of gravitation, 
makes the earth lovely, gives green- 
ness to the vegetation. We might 
liken the warmth of the sun unto 
love, and where there is no intelli- 
gence and love, there the law of the 
celestial world does not reign. Is 
there anything can grow, even the 
attributes of God in the heart of 
man, without love ? The very glory 
of God is intelligence and his nature 
is love. 

The glory of the sun is the light 
thereof typifying the celestial glory 
the place where God the Father and 
his Son Jesus Christ dwell. The 
glory of the moon, which gives light 
by night, though not so illuminat- 
ing as the sun, and possessing no 
warmth — typifies the terrestrial 
world. We are told those who in- 
herit this glory are those who are 
the honorable men of the earth. 
You will find that terrestrial law 
working among the children of men 
today. They have a smattering of 
intellectual light, and are classed as 
specialists, who are not interested 
in anything that they are not fa- 
miliar with. Take the purely scien- 
tific mind — it loves nothing except 
science. It is like the moon, cold, 
inducing nothing to growth. But 
it does give light to many a weary 
terrestrial traveler ! 

The law of the telestial glory, 



which is typified by the glory of the 
stars, gives not sufficient light to 
cast a shadow, yet there is that 
star of hope held out for all of 
God's children, that sometime, 
somewhere, they will come into the 
love of their heavenly parent, and 
enjoy his munificent blessings pre- 
pared from before the foundations 
of the world. 

Looking at vegetable life, we see 
plants that grow in darkness. They 
are pale ; they possess not the 
beauty of those that grow in open 
sunlight. When I was a youth, I 
remember being sent into the cellar 
late in the spring to sprout some 
potatoes. Every sprout was reach- 
ing out for that ray of sunlight that 
came through a little aperture! 
And yet we go through life and see 
God's highest creation, man, turn- 
ing his back on the light, and not 
as the potato sprout struggling 
therefor. I wonder if we are mag- 
nifying our calling and are growing 
toward the light in a desire to be 
warmed by Christ's love? I won- 
der if we know just who we are? 
If we do, let us be obedient unto 
every commandment of the Lord 
our Father. 

I want to say one word with re- 
spect to what Pres : dent Hinckley 
said touching the Word of Wis- 
dom. If a call were made of this 
audience to know how many of you 
drank tea or coffee for breakfast, 
how many of you would be forced 
to hang -you heads in shame! I re- 
ceive letters from those whom I 
have been instrumental in bringing 
into the Church in the old world 
when I labored as a missionary in 
London, who are traveling from 
place to place, and who say there is 
tea and coffee drunk in the homes of 
some of the prominent people of this 
land. What is the use of sending 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



your missionaries out into the world 
if you are not going to live the gos- 
pel here? Why neutralize all the 
efforts that they put forth in a de- 
sire to satisfy your appetite? You 
say, "It is a little thing, it does not 
hurt me." It hurts you and it hurts 
everybody who sees you do it, and 
I want to tell you that the judg- 
ments of Almighty God will over- 
take you, if you do not quit it. 

In New York City last year the 
scourge of infantile paralysis 
brought sorrow into many a loving 
home. The doctors do not know the 
cause of it. But I am willing to 
take the Lord at h : s word as given 
in the 89th Section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants. I have often 
wished that I were a germinologist, 
and with faith an.d confidence in the 
Lord I would start my investigation 
with the tea and coffee drinker, to 
find out if there does not lie the 
cause of the burning out of the 
tender nerve cells in the children. 
There were over 10,000 children 
stricken with this dreadful disease, 
in 1916, in New York City, and as 
many more in the State of New 
York outside of the city. Twenty- 
five per cent of those afflicted suc- 
cumbed to this .dreadful disease. 
You can scarcely go along the streets 
of New York for one day that you 
do not see some poor child with 
limbs shriveled, hobbling along on 
a crutch. 

The Lord has warned us, and I 
am willing to take his warning. He 
says, 

And all saints who remember to keep 
and do these sayings, walking in obe- 
dience to the commandments, shall re- 
ceive health in their navel, and mar- 
row to their bones, 

And shall find wisdom and great 
treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures; 



And shall run and not be weary, and 
shall walk and not faint; 

And I, the Lord, give unto them a 
promise, that the destroying ange! 
shall pass by them, as the children of 
Israel, and not slay them. 

One instance where a family of 
saints were located, three children 
were carried out of the apartment 
with infantile paralysis. They 
thought it contagious, but praise 
God, not one saint was afflicted. I 
have faith and confidence that God 
will preserve the lives of the Lat- 
ter-.day Saints in so far as they will 
yield obedience unto his laws and 
commandments. 

May God bless and help us to see 
these things, and give us strength 
above all things, to overcome the 
weaknesses of the flesh, that we 
may grow more like him each day 
of our lives, that while we are chil- 
dren in the workshop of Divinity, 
we may learn to build clean and 
holy temples for the indwelling of 
His holy spirit. 

May God bless us to this end, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the dox- 
ology, and benediction was pro- 
nounced by Elder Benjamin God- 
dard, of the Bureau of Information. 



SECOND OVERFLOW 
MEETING. 

A second overflow meeting was 
held in the Assembly Hall, at 2 
p. m., Elder Melvin J. Ballard, 
president of the Northwestern 
States mission, presiding. 

Music was furnished by the 
Richards ward choir, under direc- 
tion of Leonidas Fisher. 



ELDER S. NORMAN LEE. 



105 



The choir sang: "O awake, my 
slumbering minstrel." 

Prayer by Elder Richard C. May, 
counselor in the presidency of Big 
Horn stake. 

The choir sang an anthem : 
"Hark, hark, my soul." 



ELDER S. NORMAN LEE. 

(Recently appointed President of Box 
Elder Stake.) 

I am greatly pleased, my brethren 
and sisters, to be numbered among 
the people of God, and I am highly 
gratified that the Lord, through his 
chosen servants, has seen fit to place 
this honor upon me. I feel insig- 
nificant and inadequate, but I have 
an abiding faith that the Lord will 
fit and prepare his servants, if they 
show a willingness to work in his 
service. 

For something more than twenty 
years I have been engaged in the 
work of the Lord in connection 
with this Church ; and in that time, 
though it may seem short in com- 
parison with the experience of some 
of my brethren and sisters, I have 
learned that one of the greatest of 
all requisites is that of willingness. 
When I answered a call to go into 
the world to preach the gospel, 
when I was a mere boy, I made 
a resolution with myself that I 
would go where the servants of the 
Lord wished me to go, and perform 
such work as they desired at my 
hands, and I have found that that 
resolution has stood me in good 
stead in every department in which 
I have been engaged. When I 
reached Copenhagen, and met my 
good friend and mission president, 
Christian M. Lund, of Mount 
Pleasant, the first question he asked 
me was, "Where would you rather 



go?" I said, "Brother Lund, I 
should like to go where I am most 
needed, and I leave that matter to 
you." I found later on that many 
of the brethren were in the habit of 
expressing a preference for a cer- 
tain mission field, and I understood 
then how it was that President 
Lund seemed to be a little surprised 
that I had no preference, and that 
he singled me out for special atten- 
tion all the time during that mis- 
sion. I was sent to a place that was 
not very popular with missionaries, 
and after laboring there for six or 
seven months, a call came to send 
elders into the Baltic provinces of 
Russia and away into the country 
of Finland, and President Lund 
chose me for that mission. I 
traveled through Finland and in the 
country roun|d about Pertograd 
during three months of the summer 
just twenty years ago, hunting up 
Saints who had wandered away 
from the fold or who had been left 
without a shepherd when the 
change in government in Finland 
took place ; and in that experience, 
more than anything that had fallen 
to my lot up to that time, I learned 
a little of what it is to engage in 
the labor of love among those 
Saints who had been without a 
shepherd for a number of years, 
who were so del : ghted to see the 
servants of the Lord that they wept 
with joy. We also wept with them, 
my brethren and sisters, because we 
received thus our recompense for 
anything like the sacrifice that we 
had made. And little by little I 
learned that the great power in this 
work is the power of love. It is, a 
feeling that urs;es us onto labor for 
the general uplift of mankind, and 
when I had performed my mission 
in that country, and been honorably 
released, I made the resolution with 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



myself, on leaving that land, that 
when I returned home, I would not 
slacken my energies, but that I 
would try and keep the harness on. 
I am very pleased to say that I kept 
that resolution, more or less, and 
that I have always been employed 
wherever .1 have been located, and 
have been identified with the work 
of the Lord. I think that that wil- 
lingness to go where I was sent had 
a great deal -to do with my having 
received a call to go to Liverpool, in 
1899, and to assist President 
Charles W. Penrose in the publica- 
tion of the Millennial Star. And 
when I went upon that mission, I 
renewed that covenant that I had 
made with the Lord and myself, 
that I would not choose to have my 
way, but that I would try to find 
pleasure in doing things that the 
servant sof the Lord wished me to 
do, and I have been very gratified 
with the experience on this second 
mission. I was associated one year 
with President Penrose, and one 
year with President Clawson, and 
I have learned many things that 
have stood me in good stead in my 
labors since that time. On my re- 
turn home, or almost before I 
reached home, in 1911, I was asked 
to become a member of the high 
council of the Box Elder Stake of 
Zion, and I labored there for two or 
three years, and then was asked to 
become a counselor in the bishopric 
of the third ward, Brigham City. 
Some of my brethren looked upon 
that as a sort of a demotion, and 
asked me if I did not feel that way, 
and I do not know but that my be- 
loved President, Oleen N. Stohl, 
thought that' I might feel that way. 
He therefore gave me my choice as 
to whether I should work in the 
high council or accept this position 
in the bishopric in our ward. It 



is a source of satisfaction to me that 
I answered that if I thought I could 
do more for the general welfare of 
the community in the bishopric, that 
that was the place in which I should 
like to labor, and I went into the 
bishopric. As I look over those 
recent experiences and consider my 
recent appointment to the highly 
honorable position of president of 
one of the greatest stakes of Zion, 
I have thought that that had some- 
thing to do with bringing about this 
appointment, that I have never had 
any hesitation to serve where it was 
thought I could serve best. I have 
never had occasion to regret it, and 
I am inclined to follow that resolu- 
tion more than ever, and it is my 
constant prayer and desire to do 
something, to work in "the Church, 
and that I may so conduct my work 
in the Church that my brethren who 
preside over me should know 
exactly where I stand. I do not find 
it necessary to consult my feelings 
as to whether it would be agreeable 
with me or not, but they could place 
their hand on my shoulder with as- 
surance of knowing that I was 
there ; and whatever requirements 
may be made for me, I hope that I 
may always feel as I do today, that 
I will do the will of the Lord with- 
out respect to my own convenience 
and feelings. May we all be 
blessed with that feeling, is my

"And again, the Lord shall utter 
his voice out of heaven, saying, 
Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, 
and hear the words of that God who 
made you. O ye nations of the earth, 
how would I have gathered you to- 
gether as a hen gathereth her chick-

ens under her wings, but ye would 
not? How oft have I called upon you 
by the voice of my servants, arid by 
the ministering of angels, and by mine 
own voice, and by the voice of thun- 
derings, and by the voice of light- 
nings, and by the voice of pestilence, 
and by the voice of earthquakes, and 
great hail storms, and by the voice of 
famines and pestilences of every kind, 
and by the great sound of a trump, 
and by the voice of judgment, and by 
the voice of mercy all the day long, 
and by the voice of glory, and honor, 
and the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with an ever- 
lasting salvation, but ye would not? 
Behold the day has come, when the 
cup of the wrath of mine indignation 
is full. Behold, verily I say unto you, 
that these are the words of the Lord 
your God" (Doc. and Gov. 43:23-27). 

The spirit of this conference and 
the thought that has repeatedly 
come to me are best expressed in 
the words that I have just read to 
you. 

What is the language of the 
Lord, and how does he speak to his 
people ? Language is only useful in 
the communication of thought. That 
thought may be communicated in 
writing, as I have read it to you, 
which appeals only and is service- 
able only to those who can see and 
who can read and understand the 
words that they see. Thought may 
be communicated by the word of 
mouth, serviceable only to those 
who have the gift of hearing and 
who understand the language in 
which those thought symbols are 
expressed. To those who cannot see, 
and cannot hear, there has been a 
means devised by embossed letters, 
that thought may be communicated 
by appealing to one of those three 
natural senses. God, likewise, has 
chosen those means of communi- 
cating to his children, by the writ- 
ten word and by the spoken word, 
and also he communicates through 



feelings. He has other means of 
communication, by the whisperings 
of the still small voice that is heard 
by the ear of our spirits. And when 
his children fail to heed the written 
word, fail to respond to the spoken 
word, fail to hear and obey the 
whisperings of the still small voice, 
then God must speak in some 
sterner language, that his children 
will understand and obey, and he 
often employs the forces of nature, 
in the thunder storm, in lightning, 
in famine, in earthquake, in some 
one of the forces of nature, to bring 
to the understanding and attention 
of his children that which they 
would not understand in more gen- 
tle tones. For 120 years God spoke 
through his servant Noah to the 
children of his great world family, 
as they existed at that time. They 
failed to respond to the spoken 
word ; they failed to respond to the 
word of tradition, as it came down 
to them from their father Adam, 
and so God must then speak 
through some voice of nature that 
his word might be heard and his 
mandates obeyed ; and the clouds 
of heaven gathered, and burst forth 
and scattered rain upon the earth 
until the low places were filled, 
until floods dashed upon the streets 
and into the valleys, and the people 
began to flee from their homes to 
the high places. Noah had with- 
drawn with his family into the ark, 
and with him the chosen beasts of 
the field. When the people perceiv- 
ing their peril cried out unto God, 
"Save us from this peril," it was 
too late ; their opportunity for sal- 
vation had passed. 

God spoke through his servants, 
by his word of inspiration, by 
dreams, by revelation, even through 
the mouth of the boy Joseph, that 
there would come •& time when 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



famine would fill the land. The 
brothers and nephews of this boy 
who had been so favored of the 
Lord sold him into Egypt and then, 
later, at the feet of pagan Egypt 
the children of Israel had to kneel 
and beg for bread. Yet rebellious 
Israel forgot God in their days of 
prosperity, and were finally per- 
mitted to be taken into bondage and 
captivity to the Egyptians, and for 
years and years they suffered the 
humiliation of slavery. When the 
time came for their deliverance, 
there came the voice of God to the 
pagan idolaters of Egypt, "Let my 
people go," but they heeded not the 
voice of the servants of God, which 
made it necessary to appeal to them 
through some of the forces of nat- 
ture, speaking through some sterner 
voice that they might understand 
and obey, and pestilences of frogs, 
of lice, of darkness, came, and yet 
they did not understand. Finally, 
the word went forth that "this 
night shall the first born son in 
every Egyptian home be slain." 
When the morning broke and it was 
discovered in the homes of the 
Egyptians that their first born sons 
were slain, then they understood. 
God had at last spoken a language 
that pagan Egypt understood and 
obeyed, and Israel went forth, 
miraculously .delivered from tne 
hands of the Egyptians, mricaulous- 
ly delivered from the waves of the 
Red Sea, miraculously fed in the 
wilderness by manna from heaven, 
by water from the rock ; and while 
their prophet Moses was upon 
Mount Sinai, receiving the com- 
mandments written upon tablets of 
stone by the finger of God, the first 
of which read, "Thou shalt have no 
other gods before me," Israel, this 
chosen people, down in the valley, 
were bowing down to a golden calf, 



and crying for the fleshpots of 
Egypt. Idolatrous worship had 
again filled their hearts, and the 
Lord was compelled by such ex- 
pression, by such idoltry, to cause 
them to circle about in that great 
•desert until they had all, practically, 
passed away, that their offspring 
might go over the river Jordan into 
the promised land. 

We hasten on. In the days of the 
Master, we find him presenting that 
great parable of the marriage feast, 
wherein was shown that he sent out 
servants to invite his subjects to the 
feast. A few only came, and then 
he sent them out again : "Go ye into 
the highways and byways, and com- 
pel them to come." Not by the force 
of the law, nor the force of armies. 
They had declined to come because, 
some had recently married and 
were on their honeymoons, others 
had purchased a yoke of oxen, and 
were so busy caring for and trying 
them; others were so busy in the 
fields and could not come. But then 
went forth the command to bring 
them, sent out, not by strength of 
arms, but by removing the obstacle 
that stood in the way. "Thou shalt 
have no other gods before me," and 
if there is an object of worship 
standing between me and my God, 
when my God speaks for me to 
come, I must watch lest that object 
of my affection, the object of my 
worship, making it possible for me 
to obey, is removed, whether it be 
wife, whether it be riches, whether 
it be lands and possessions, it mat- 
tereth not. When God speaks, it is 
for me to hearken ; when God com- 
mands, it is for me to obey. Saul 
of Tarsus was on his way to Da- 
mascus to take bound the Saints of 
God unto Jerusalem. He had heard 
the word of the Master ; he had 
heard the testimonies of the apos- 



ELDER HEBER Q. HALE. 



109 



ties ; he had read the scriptures, and 
was second to none in his knowl- 
edge of the law, and yet he heeded 
not the written word, the testi- 
monies of the apostles and prophets 
of God, all were unheeded by him. 
God must yet speak in some other 
language, in some other manner, to 
awaken in the heart of Saul the 
spark of truth; and while on this 
mission of persecution the voice of 
God spoke out of the clouds, "Saul, 
Saul, why persecutest thou me?" 
Saul fell dumb and blind to the 
ground, quivering, shaking in every 
part of his body. He knew that 
some power had spoken, because, 
he felt it all over him, and was 
turned blind and helpless on the 
ground. And as soon as he re- 
gained his speech, he called out, 
"Lord, what wouldst thou have me 
to do?" "Go to Damascus, seek 
out Ananias, and he will tell thee 
what thou must do." Paul obeyed. 
When he approached Ananias, An- 
anias had already received the reve- 
lation, and was ready for him, and 
he baptized the repentant Saul, laid 
his hands on him, and when the 
Holy Ghost came upon him, the 
scales fell from his eyes, and Saul, 
the persecutor of the Saints, be- 
came Paul the great indefatigable 
apostle of Jesus Christ. 

The Lord hath spoken in this 
day. His word has been revealed 
by the mouths of angels, and even 
by the mouth of the Son of God. ' 
His word has been revealed in the 
coming forth of the Book of Mor- 
mon and in the revelations known 
to us as the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and the Pearl of Great Price. 
And this gospel of the kingdom, in 
conformity to the instructions and 
commissions imposed upon those 
who organized this Church and who 
constituted its first elders, has been 



carried to practically every civilized 
nation in the world, and has been 
preached as a witness of the second 
coming of the Christ, and the mes- 
sage of salvation to the children of 
men. And yet, while these nations 
have been warned, while the gos- 
pel has been carried to them by 
thousands of elders, yet . they re- 
main in the same condition of un- 
belief. And while they have had 
the Bible and Christian churches 
who aspired to guide them toward 
heaven, yet they remain in ignor- 
ance of the peril that hangs over 
their heads, and God has been com- 
pelled to speak to the European na- 
tions in the sterner voice of war 
and bloodshed, brought upon them 
by their own avarice, by their own 
jealousies, by their own indiffer- 
ence to the commandments of Go.d, 
and the teachings of Christianity ; 
and if it be the will of God that this 
condition must continue, and if it 
be necessary, I say, that this price 
must be paid for that most precious 
of all possessions, namely, peace, 
as heralded by the angels in their 
song at the birth of the Christ, then 
let us pray that when this price is 
paid that peace may come, and that 
the peace of God may be manifest 
in the earth and among the inhabi- 
tants thereof, and the earth be pre- 
pared for his second coming. 

Let it not be said of you, any one 
of you, or of me, that it shall be 
necessary for God to speak in any 
other way than by his own word or 
by the spoken word through the 
mouths of his servants, before we 
obey. Let us be like the brother 
who preceded me today, let us be 
ready and willing to go where we 
are sent, and stay where we are 
asked to remain. Let us respond to 
every duty, fulfil every obligation, 
live up to every responsibility, for 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I want to tell you, in the name of 
the Lord, that we are living in the 
most perilous times in history.. 
There has never been a time in your 
life, and never will be again, when 
a greater price shall be paid for 
bread and the necessities of life, 
than in the year that now confronts 
us. Let us stand on safe ground, 
and know that we are on the side 
of liberty, righteousness and God. 
Then we are safe. 

Let us have the testimony the 
prophet Brigham Young had, and 
so expressed in these words: "I 
have made up my mind to live my 
religion, and be saved, though all 
other men go to hell." There was 
positiveness ; there was conviction ; 
there was strength. And in the 
strength of such character and such 
faith, God's people will be protected 
in these valleys of the mountains. 
But without this faith, without this 
testimony, without righteous living 
among the people of God, there 
can be no promise. 

God help us to live our religion, 
keep God's commandments, live up 
to our obligations as Latter-day 
Saints, and get the testimony that 
he lives, that this gospel is true, and 
it is worth living for, and it is 
worth dying for. May God help us 
to do this, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR W. HORSLEY. 

(President of the Carbon Stake of 
Zion.) 

I am very grateful to my heav- 
enly Father that I have the priv- 
ilege of attending this conference. 
A few days ago I did not feel phys- 
ically able to come to Salt Lake, but 
through my faith and prayers, and 
the will of the Lord, I am able to 
be at this conference and to enjoy 



the spirit thereof in listening to the 
servants of the Lord, listening to 
his prophets, seers and revelators 
give unto us instructions that are 
for our good and benefit today. 

While listening to what has been 
said during this conference, and 
what has been said by the elders 
this afternoon, the thought has 
gone through my mind, if ever 
there was a time in the history of 
this Church or the people of this 
Nation when we needed to watch 
and pray, it is today, for we are 
truly living in perilous times, and 
we know not what the end will be. 
But we will have to stand in holy 
places, and pay our devotion to 
God, our eternal Father, and pray 
to him for his guidance that we 
may do the right. 

We need to look after the boy 
and the girl today, because we ex- 
pect them to be the men and the 
women of tomorrow. We must 
teach them the correct principles of 
the gospel, not only by precept but 
by example. There is a vast amount 
of work for the elders of the 
Church to do, at home and abroad, 
warning mankind of the impending 
judgments that will befall the 
wicked unless they repent and turn 
unto God. We have many precious 
souls given us to watch over in the 
various wards and stakes of Zion, 
thousands of them born under the 
new and everlasting covenant need 
to be watched over and to be taught 
the principles of the gospel. But I 
have been grieved sometimes when 
I have heard some of the brethren 
say that they have not time to labor 
at home, and that they have come to 
the conclusion that so much ward 
teaching in the wards of the Saints 
is not really necessary, and this is 
verified by the reports we get from 
time to time when we find in some 



ELDER ARTHUR HORSLEY. 



Ill 



cases only 20 or 30 per cent of the 
inhabitants of the stakes visited by 
ward teachers. I rejoice in the la- 
bors of the ward teachers where I 
reside.becanse I know they do good. 
I am very much interested when 
they visit my house, not so much 
interested perhaps in the eloquence 
which they may display, or the doc- 
trines which they may promulgate, 
but I am anxious for the answers 
that are coming forth from my chil- 
dren, wondering, when questions 
are put to them by the ward teach- 
ers, what the answers will be. That 
is what I am concerned about most- 
ly, and I am always pleased if the 
questions are answered. If only the 
simple question is asked: "Do you 
pay your tithes and your offer- 
ings ?" I await, trembling some- 
times, the answer, and I am always 
glad when the answer is, yes, we 
believe in that doctrine, and that 
we observe its requirements. Then 
the question, "Do you pray unto the 
Lord morning and night for his 
guidance?" I wonder again what 
the answer will be, and I rejoice in 
my soul when the answer comes, 
"Yes." And again, when the ques- 
tion comes, "When you grow up 
and desire a wife, or a husband, as 
the case may be, do you understand 
it is your duty to go to the House 
of the Lord, and to be sealed for 
time and all eternity?" again ,1 
await the answer, trembling and 
wondering what the answer will be, 
and it brings joy to my soul, when 
I hear the answer, "I will, if the 
Lord is willing, and I am worthy." 
These thoughts are very practical to 
the Latter-day Saints, and they are 
highly necessary. We want to know 
just what our boy is thinking about, 
and just what our girl is thinking 
about, and we want to know if they 
have a testimony of this gospel in 



their souls. Fathers and mothers 
should know this, and they may 
not get it in any other way than 
through the ward teacher. I might 
ask the question, and they might 
not want to disappoint me, and 
they would say "yes." I have heard 
young men say that they went 
on missions because their father 
asked them to go, and they wished 
to please him. I want my boy to 
go because he feels it his duty, 
whether it pleases me or not. And 
they should have the necessary faith 
for this, and we should teach these 
principles. We should labor while 
it is day, for the night cometh when 
no man can work. 

I was very forcibly impressed 
with the remarks of President 
Smith, when he said we want to be 
loyal to God and to our nation. We 
must be loyal to God every day of 
our lives, and I hope that when our 
boys have to go out in defense of 
our country that they will go with 
the love for humanity, and desir- 
ing the liberty and rights of the 
children of God in the earth. Well 
might the Savior say at one time, 
"Ry their fruits ye shall know 
them." We are known by that 
which we produce in the earth, and 
we want it said of us, "Well done, 
thou good and faithful servant." 

I know that this is the work of 
the Lord. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God. I 
know that God lives, and he hears 
and answers the prayers of the 
Saints, and the sick are healed 
through faith and prayer. I know 
that these principles are true, and 
my prayer is that we may live in 
the earth so as to be entitled to the 
blessings that God has in store, that 
when it comes time for us to lay 
down this body it may be said truth- 
fully of us, 'Well done, thou good 



112

and faithful servant, enter into the 
joy of thy Lord," which is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang : 
"High on the mountain top." 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 

(President of the Cassia Stake of Zion.) 

My brethren and sisters: I am 
very happy to be permitted to meet 
with you in this general conference 
of the Church, and with you to re- 
joice in the splendid testimonies and 
the words of truth and inspiration 
that have fallen from the lips of the 
general authorities of the Church. 
I rejoice in the word of the Lord, 
because in it there is righteousness ; 
it points to us the way, it suggests 
to us the course that we ought to 
pursue. It teaches us that we ought 
to walk in the path and be directed 
in the course in which lies salvation 
in the end. At this moment there 
are assembled together in the three 
congregations upon this block pos- 
sibly more than twenty thousand 
members of the Church, men and 
women who have come from all the 
different parts of the Church, that 
they might be instructed in the 
word and will of the Lord, and I 
earnestly desire that while I shall 
stand before you for a few moments 
this afternoon that my time may not 
be spent in vain, but that the same 
good spirit which has prompted 
those who have preceded me in this 
position, and which has actuated all 
of the speakers in the general as- 
sembly during the past three days, 
and this morning, may be felt dur- 
ing these few moments. 

That the Lord has spoken again 
from the heavens there can be no 
question in our minds. That the 



angel spoken of by John the Reve- 
lator (John 14:6) has come to the 
earth, and has brought that glori- 
ous message, we do not doubt this 
afternoon. Indeed, our presence 
here is an evidence of the belief that 
we have in the fulfilment of that 
glorious prediction by the Apostle 
John. And that the Lord appeared 
to the Prophet Joseph, Smith is 
equally evident. And that the gos- 
pel has been established upon the 
earth is true. Possibly the majority 
of those who are here this after- 
noon are members of the Church, 
and to attain that membership it 
has been necessary for us to be- 
lieve in God, accepting him and 
acknowledging him as our spiritual 
Father, as the Father of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh ; 
and that Jesus was born of the 
Virgin Mary, and that he fulfilled 
his earthly mission, and that his life 
was concluded in the sacrifice that 
he offered for us and for the world. 
We believe that through the atone- 
ment of Christ all men will be 
saved, through obedience to the 
laws and ordinances of the gospel. 
This is specific salvation. There is 
in the atonement of Christ a gen- 
eral term of salvation. "As in 
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall 
all be made alive." So, as many as 
shall die and have died through the 
transgression of Adam, shall be res- 
urrected from the grave by the 
atonement of Jesus Christ. That 
will be true of all men, saint and 
sinner, Jew and Gentile, bond and 
free. All men will be participants 
in the benefits of the atonement of 
Jesus Christ, as far as the resur- 
rection of these bodies is concerned. 
There is no question about that in 
my mind. If there is any one fact 
in scripture that is proved beyond 
the peradventure of a doubt more 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 



113 



than another, it is the fact of the 
literal resurrection of the bodies of 
those who have lived. With this be- 
lief in the Father and in his Son 
Jesus Christ, who came into the 
world that we might live, and our 
belief in that wonderful influence 
that comes from the presence of 
God and fills the immensity of space 
by which our natural minds and our 
understandings are quickened, our 
eyes opened, and our comprehen- 
sion is enlarged, to which we refer 
as the Holy Ghost, a personage of 
spirit, — I say with faith in this, and 
with faith in the love and mercy of 
our Father in heaven, and in men 
whom God has chosen from among 
their fellows and placed upon them 
a portion of his honor, giving them 
authority to officiate in his name 
and power to act among the chil- 
dren of men in the same manner 
and with the same effect as though 
he were present himself and per- 
formed these ordinances, we are fit 
candidates for initiation into his 
Church. With faith in God, with 
faith in Jesus Christ his Sop, with 
faith in the mission and operations 
of the Holy Ghost, and with faith 
in the men whom God has appointed 
to preside over us in the holy priest- 
hood, we are then fit candidates for 
baptism, that baptism by which we 
are "buried in the water" and come 
forth out of the watery grave to a 
newness of life. "Know ye not," 
the Apostle Paul declares, "that so 
many of us as were baptized into 
Jesus Christ were baptized into his 
death? Wherefore, we are buried 
with him into death, that like as 
Christ was raised up from the 
dead, by the glory of the Father, 
we also should walk in newness of 
life ; for if we have been planted 
together in the likeness of his death, 
we shall be also raised up after the 



likeness of his resurrection." Now 
we have received these glorious or- 
dinances. We have been baptized in 
the water, in the name of the Fath- 
er and of the Son and of the Holy 
Ghost, and we have come forth to a 
newness of life. I hope, my breth- 
ren an.d sisters, that it is to a new- 
ness of life. I hope that we were 
able to "put off the old man" of sin 
when we went down into that 
watery grave. I hope we have been 
able to live above the traditions of 
the world, so that when the hands 
of the elders were placed upon our 
heads and the Holy Ghost was con- 
ferred upon us that we became fit 
receptacles for the indwelling of 
that divine influence, that we might 
then be in that attitude of mind and 
purity of body that we. would be 
able to receive the whisperings of 
that still small voice, and that we 
would be guided by its promptings, 
directed by its influence, and 
strengthened by its power. And if 
we have thus lived, and if today we 
sit in this congregation as men and 
women thus favored of the Lord 
our God, then happy are we. But 
I am sorry, my brethren and sisters, 
to admit in your hearing this after- 
noon, that there are many of the 
Latter-day Saints who believe in the 
divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in the restoration of 
the gospel in the day and age in 
which we live, who went forth into 
the waters of baptism and received 
the "laying on of hands of the pres- 
bytery" and who, soon after, sat 
down on the banks of the stream, 
and failed to grasp the situation and 
the opportunities around about. 
They failed to live their religion, 
fa : led to comply with the require- 
ments made upon them, failed to 
grow with the growth of the Church 
and today they find themselves far 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the rear of the advanced condi- 
tion of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. So these con- 
ferences are called, these assem- 
blies gather together from time to 
time, in order that our ears may be 
opened to the voice of the Lord as 
it comes to us through his divinely 
appointed servants, and if we are 
wise and desire, in a night not very 
far distant, to have oil in our lamps 
and to have those lamps trimmed 
and burning, we will receive the 
word with gladness, and we will 
put it into practice in our lives. We 
will be guided by it in these days of 
trouble and trial and evil in the 
world, and we will live near unto 
the Lord, so that when these trou- 
bles become more grievous, and per- 
haps more close to us than they 
have been in the past two and a half 
years, that our feet will be found 
standing in holy places, that we will 
have God for our friend, that we 
will have taken the Holy Spirit for 
our guide, that we will henceforth 
be able to stand amid the wh : rl of 
doubt and the fear of nations, hav- 
ing our trust planted in the God of 
Israel, realizing and remembering 
the promises that Jehovah made 
while he was here in his personal 
ministry, and which he has made 
through his spoken word to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. If we are 
able to read, we will read the signs 
of the times, as Daniel read the 
handwriting on Belshazzar's wall 
and understood in a moment what 
it meant. 

I believe every Latter-day Saint 
ought today to be standing in such 
a holy place, and living such a holy 
life, that he or she will be able to 
discern the signs of the times. We 
may not be able to tell, as was 
stated this morning, within any cer- 
tain number of months or years, the 



time of the second advent of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; but 
we will know this, that when the 
fig tree is putting forth its leaves 
summer is nigh, and that the warm 
weather will soon come upon us. 
We may know just as assuredly that 
we are living in a time near the 
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, if 
we are able to read the signs of the 
times. I do not know how many 
of you have read recently the 24th 
chapter of Matthew, and have con- 
sidered the words of the Lord 
Jesus, uttered prior to his crucifix- 
ion, with reference to these very 
times in which we are living. If 
you remember, he refers the people 
to the prophecy of Daniel of old, 
with reference to the destruction of 
Jerusalem and with reference to the 
days and times in which we are liv- 
ing and his second coming. You 
remember he makes the statement 
that when these tribulations and de- 
struction, referred to by Daniel, 
shall appear among the peoples of 
the earth, then is time for us to be 
putting our feet in holy places. I 
want to say in passing that those 
who have attended the sessions of 
this conference have endeavored, 
and to this extent have manifested 
the disposition to be in a holy place 
during this time, and I congratulate 
you for it, my brethren and sisters. 
You are doing well. 

If in your lives, during the com- 
ing six months, or the coming year, 
or years, you will continue to stand, 
not only in this holy house, or in 
all the holy houses tnat God has ap- 
pointed for us to meet in, it will be 
well with you. When I look over 
the reports, I find that only an av- 
erage of from 16 to 20 per cent of 
the membership of this Church at- 
tend their sacramental meetings on 
Sunday afternoon, I am constrained 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 



115 



to believe that some if not many of 
the Latter-day Saints have not de- 
cided to stand in holy places on the 
Sabbath afternoon, and I think thai, 
the words of Paul are finding some 
application in the lives of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in which he said, 
speaking to his favorite son, Timo- 
thy, that in the latter-days, those in 
which we are living, "perilous times 
shall come, for men shall be lovers 
of their own selves, covetous, boast- 
ers, proud, blasphemers, disobe- 
dient to parents, unthankful, un- 
holy, without natural affection, 
trucebreakers, false accusers, incon- 
tinent, fierce, despisers of those that 
are good, traitors, heady, high- 
minded, lovers of pleasure' more 
than lovers of God." I am afraid 
that sometimes this spirit of evil is 
entering in among the Latter-day 
Saints, in that we would rather be 
somewhere else on the Sabbath day, 
when our feet should rest in some 
holy place, during the two hours of 
our sacramental meeting. 

The same is true of the priest- 
hood. Twenty-six per cent on an 
average of those who hold the 
priesthood attend the ward priest- 
hood meetings. It is not very cred- 
itable to us, as members of the 
Church, is it? Every blessing that 
we enjoy, or that is to be enjoyed in 
the Church, either in time or in 
eternity, must come to us through 
this holy priesthood. When we for- 
get this, we forget our duty to God, 
and to ourselves, and also to the 
priesthood. We are told in the 29th 
section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that those who have not this 
priesthood in the world to come will 
have no power of salvation; that 
those who are cast off into the out- 
side, where there shall be weeping 
and wailing and gnashing of teeth 
and eternal darkness, will not be 



able to come out of that place be- 
cause they have no power. Now, 
you brethren who hold the power 
of the priesthood, and that means 
the power of salvation by ' which 
you can lift yourselves above the 
groveling events of this earth, and 
be exalted, heirs to the kingdom 
of God. Therefore, let us honor 
this priesthood ; let us do our duty, 
and comply with all the require- 
ments made of us, and God will 
honor us both here and hereafter. 

Needless to say we are living in 
troublous times, when that phial 
of wrath has been poured out upon 
the land and upon the sea, when 
the hand of destruction is falling 
upon those who dwell upon the 
earth, upon the land and upon the 
sea. I think so, and it will increase 
until the consummation of all things 
and the dawn of the millennium 
have come 'to us. We need not be 
surprised at these things. They are 
coming. Our sons may have to go 
to the front. They may have to 
enlist and go out and face the en- 
emy, the enemy of our country, be- 
cause I want to say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that God has 
given this land to be the home of 
the free, and this country will ever 
be a free nation. I do not consider 
that the time will ever come that 
any foreign king will ever be per- 
mitted to rule upon this land, be- 
cause the decree and purposes of 
God are all opposed to that. But 
there will come a time — there is 
coming a time, when the good peo- 
ple of this nation, just as far as 
their wickedness extends, will be 
scourged by the hand of the 
scourger until thev have opened 
their eyes and understood the pur- 
poses of God. 

Let me say. in closing, that in the 
midst of this time let us be sure that 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



we keep in mind the purposes of 
our lives. Some men may love to 
conquer as they have done in the 
past, and we know we hope to con- 
quer. I want to say to you for the 
comfort of those mothers and fath- 
ers of sons that may have to go into 
the war, that we shall and must 
conquer in the power of Israel's 
God. The history of the past shows 
us very plainly that very few men, 
without the power of God resting 
upon them, have been able to con- 
quer, and that principle suggests 
the truth today as it ever was. 
There are a great many things be- 
sides fighting for us to do. The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is an organization of 
peace and an organization of uplift. 
Not very many days ago, in the 
section in which I live and in the 
stake over which I have the honor 
to preside, there came into our 
district representatives of the 
Canadian government, soliciting 
our young men, our sons and 
our fathers, to leave their homes 
and go over into Canada, in 
order that the soil of Canada 
might be tilled and crops pro- 
duced. Their young men had 
gone to the war, their communities 
had been deprived of men who had 
been engaged in commerce and 
labor, and therefore it became nec- 
essary for them to send representa- 
tives into the various states of this 
nation in order to employ boys to 
till the soil for them. Perhaps many 
of our boys will rush headlong into 
the ranks, so that little means will 
be left for help in tilling the soil. 
I live in an agricultural district, and 
I consider very strongly that an 
important duty is to the soil, to the 
raising of crops in order that the 
people, even those who are engaged 
in the conflicts of war may be pro- 



vided with the necessaries of life. 
There will be plenty to go to the 
front; and yet, all should be ready 
to go, if required. Though I am 
past the age myself, yet I feel, if 
the time comes and necessity calls 
for it, and my other necessities will 
spare me — because I have other du- 
ties that I cannot very well forego 
— if I can be spared from those 
other callings and wants, I will be 
glad to do all I can. Yet I must 
recognize that these other things de- 
volve upon me. 

Our loyalty need not be ques- 
tioned, because God knows there 
are no people in the United States 
in whose veins flows more loyal 
blood than in the veins of the 
members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Well, 
let us be true to ourselves, my 
brethren and sisters; let us be true 
to the Church that has given us 
such a glorious heritage. Let us be 
true to God who has made it possi- 
ble for us to occupy these peaceful 
valleys of the mountains, that we 
may live out in perfection the life 
that God has given us, so that when 
we shall pass away from this earth 
there shall await us the glorious 
reward of salvation in the king- 
dom of our God, I humbly ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Zion.) 

My beloved Brethren and Sisters: 
I can assure you that I feel very 
humble and dependent upon the 
Spirit of the Lord in standing be- 
fore you here this afternoon ; and 
from the bottom of my heart I de-

sire that the Lord may prompt me 
in the words that I may utter in 
your hearing. We are living in an 
age when God has again spoken 
from the heavens, and established 
his work upon the earth. That 
work will remain ; it will not be 
taken away, and it will not be given 
to another people, because it has 
been established of our heavenly 
Father. It matters not what we 
might or might not do; it matters 
not what influences may be brought 
to bear in the world, my testimony 
is that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
has been established in the earth 
and it will remain to accomplish the 
full purposes of God, our heavenly 
Father. I have a testimony that is 
burning in my bosom which de- 
clares to me that. God lives. It de- 
clares to me that Jesus is the Christ. 
It declares to me that Joseph Smith 
is indeed a prophet of God, raised 
up in our day as an instrument in 
the hands of God to accomplish di- 
vine purposes. 

Today we say there are a great 
many prophecies going into fulfil- 
ment. The prophets have said that 
there would be a change of seasons, 
the seasons would be changed, that 
mens' hearts would fail, that all the 
former signs would be changed, 
and the peoples of the earth would 
change in their opinions, and that 
wars and rumors of wars would 
agitate the hearts of people in the 
world. My heart goes out today to 
the people in the world. 

A number of years ago I was 
called to go upon a mission, 
and in the commencement of my 
mission I was assigned to labor in 
the little kingdom of Belgium, in 
the little city of Liege. I was after- 
wards appointed to travel without 
money and without price in all the 
cities and hamlets in that little 



country, and had the privilege of 
bearing my testimony to a great 
many people in that land. With 
all my heart I am thankful to my 
heavenly Father for the privilege 
that I had to go to that land, and to 
raise my voice of warning unto that 
people, to declare unto them that 
the heavens had again been opened, 
that the gospel of Christ had again 
been established upon the earth in 
our own day. It was indeed a great 
pleasure to me, and I want to say, 
that during my labors there I found 
a good people. I found them to be 
hospitable. They have taken me 
into their homes. They have given 
me a bed to sleep in, food to eat, 
and clothing to wear, and many of 
them have accepted the gospel of 
Jesus Christ and I believe that the 
testimonies of the elders who have 
traversed that land stand out be- 
fore those people today, even as the 
handwriting on the wall. They re- 
member the testimonies, and they 
are burning in their bosoms. 

I want to testify to you that it is 
not alone the testimonies and the 
acceptance of the gospel; it is not 
alone the fact that you received the 
gospel and that you went down into 
the waters of baptism and were 
born again ; but the great question 
for me and for you to know is, that 
we have accepted that gospel with 
clean hands and with repentant 
hearts, and that we came out of 
the waters of baptism and re- 
ceived by the servants of the Lord 
through the laying on of hands the 
Holy Ghost. I testify to you that 
though you go into the waters and 
come out of the waters, if you have 
not repented in your souls, your 
baptism will not be accounted unto 
you for righteousness. Therefore, 
I say it is important for us to real- 
ize and understand that when we 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



enter into these sacred covenants 
we have not finished, but have sim- 
ply commenced the great work that 
lies before us. 

After laboring a short time in 
Belgium, I was called to labor in 
the Swiss-German mission, to pre- 
side over that mission, and I had an 
experience during my time in that 
land, in France, in Switzerland and 
Germany, and I want to say to you 
that my heart is filled with grati- 
tude to our heavenly Father that 1 
did have the privilege of bearing 
my testimony in all the provinces 
of Germany, in Austria, in Hun- 
gary, in France, in Switzerland, in 
many of the homes of the people. I 
feel thankful for the privilege that 
I had of going into those lands and 
bearing unto them a warning testi- 
mony of the establishment of the 
Church of Christ in our day. It 
was not without a great .deal of op- 
position that the gospel was 
preached in Germany. I remember 
many times of attending meetings 
in the great city of Berlin, the cap- 
ital. Many times before we met, 
in fasting and prayer, we implored 
the Lord that he might protect us 
in the secret meetings that we were 
about to hold, that we might not be 
molested by the hands of those who 
were our enemies, that they might 
not overtake us and banish us from 
their land. We had the message of 
peace and of love, and our souls 
were filled with love and our de- 
sires were to deliver our message to 
that great people in the land of Ger- 
many. Ofttimes the secret officers 
entered our meeting houses, dressed 
as civilians, and there they have 
taken our missionaries, thence to 
prison, and many times our elders 
have served .days and weeks behind 
the bars for the gospel's sake, but I 
want to testify to you that our el- 



ders did not murmur. They sang 
praises to God, and the testimonies 
of the gospel burned in their bos- 
oms. There was no doubt in their 
souls that God lives, no doubt in 
their souls that Joseph Smith is 
a prophet of God, and that God was 
able to take care of them and pro- 
tect them. They were always ready 
and willing to go where they were 
called to go, it mattered not what 
the danger might have been. And 
I believe today there are thousands 
of people, yes, I was going to say 
there are millions of people direct- 
ly and indirectly who have heard 
the testimonies from the lips of our 
elders as well as from the many 
tracts that they have distributed in 
those lands, I believe, today, that 
their hearts are pricked. They be- 
lieve in their souls that they re- 
jected the message of life and sal- 
vation which was delivered unto 
them. I remember at one time in 
my travels throughout the mission, 
I went up to attend a conference in 
Koenigsburg on the Baltic, near the 
borders of Russia, and we held a 
splendid conference, and the Spirit 
of the Lord was manifest, although 
we were in secret, and our house of 
worship was filled with strangers. 
The Spirit of God was made mani- 
fest in great power. And I believe 
that in my broken German I stood 
before that congregation and bore 
my testimony to them, and for the 
first time during the six years that I 
was in the mission field, after the 
services were ended, the officer of 
the law tapped me on the shoulder 
and said, "Come with me." Those 
were indeed trying moments', but 
there was no fear in the souls of 
our elders. We knew that we were 
engaged in the work of the Mas- 
ter, and that he had the power to 
protect his servants. I went with 



ELDER SERGE F. BALLIFF. 



119 



this man to the court of justice, and 
for many hours they questioned and 
cross-questioned, and then sent me 
from one department of the court 
to another, and finally, for the first 
time in all my experience (this 
I have never told before), the judg- 
ment came, and I was banished 
from Posen. I did not make it 
known to my brethren in Zion. And 
those few who were with me, I told 
them, this shall not go further. But 
on my dismissal I continued my la- 
bors, and I visited all of the large 
cities in that land, and notwith- 
standing the fact that the officers of 
the law were watching for us, our 
enemies were on the lookout for us 
in all the cities of that land ; yet 
from time to time we visited those 
cities, and we preached the gospel 
of Christ unto them unmolested. I 
want to say to you here, when I 
came out of that house of judgment 
I was directed to the American 
Consul, and if ever in my life my 
heart was touched, it was when I 
passed before that building where 
was located the American consul- 
late, and there I saw the Stars and 
Stripes unfolded. If ever my heart 
went out in gratitude to God that I 
was born under the Stars and 
Stripes, I felt then like bowing my 
knees and thanking God for the 
flag, which declares peace and lib- 
erty to all men ; and in my soul I 
felt that the time sometime will 
come when freedom will reign in 
that great land of Germany, when 
they will, in the providences of our 
heavenly Father, have a land of 
freedom in that country, when men 
can go and proclaim their belief in 
God according to the dictates of 
their conscience, and proclaim it in 
that land as they can now do it in 
the land of America, the land of 
the Stars and Stripes. 



That was my thought and desire 
when I visited that splendid peo- 
ple, and I want to say here that the 
masses of the people in Germany 
today are not responsible for the 
conditions that exist in their land. 
There is the blood of Israel in their 
veins. The handdealings of the 
Lord will be meted out in justice 
unto the rulers of that people, and 
the time will come, and is not far 
distant, when the meek and the 
lowly, the humble, in that land will 
have the privilege of hearing and 
embracing the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. In all my experience in the 
German mission — and in my ex- 
periences I met some sad ones — it 
was my privilege, my duty, I will 
say, to lay away two of our elders 
who were overcome in sickness. We 
sent the body of one of them to his 
native land. The other one today 
lies in the cemetery, near Berb'n. It 
was indeed a sad time in my life 
when I laid his remains to rest in 
that foreign land. But I have burn- 
ing in my soul a testimony that, on 
that great day which we commemo- 
rate today, the spirit which actuated 
the body of Brother Coombs who 
lies there will again take up its 
abode, and he will have a part in 
that glorious resurrection of the 
just. 

My brethren and sisters, I testify 
to you that this is God's work, in 
which we are engaged, and the only 
things that can prevent us from en- 
ioying the blessings and the prom- 
ises of the gospel are our own sins 
and transgressions. 

Of all those trials that I have 
borne in the misssion field, there 
was one more trial that was harder 
to me than them all, that was the 
time when one of our elders — only 
one in all the time that I was in 
that mission — transgressed the laws 



120

of God, and when I had to send 
the recommendation for his return 
dishonorably. My brethren and 
sisters, there was a trembling in my 
heart and in my hand when I had 
to sign the dishonorable release of 
one of our elders. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May the spirit of this con- 
ference go home with you, and may 
it be disseminated in your hearts. 
May your little ones, your sons and 
your daughters, partake of that 
good spirit and influence that has 
been made manifest here in this 
conference. God bless you, is my 
prayer and testimony, in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

An Easter anthem was sung by 
Don Priestly and the choir: "Ho- 
zanna !" 

President Melvin J. Ballard of 
the Northwestern States mission

Authorities of the Church, as pre-

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of the Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters: In con- 
clusion, I desire to add my testi- 
mony to that of my brethren. My 
heart has rejoiced through this con- 
ference that the Latter-day Saints 
have the opportunity, the wonderful 
privilege, to be guided by the word 
of the Lord ; for, go where you will 
in the world, unrest is there, un- 
certainty, men are wondering what 
is coming; their hearts are filled 
with anxiety, they are asking the 
question, "Watchman, what of the 



hour?" and none seems able to an- 
swer. Our watchmen have an- 
swered us in this conference, from 
the chief watchman to those who 
stand with him. They have told us 
of the hour. They have advised 
us what is coming and what shall 
be, and have pointed out to us our 
duty as members of the Church. 

I rejoice in the comfort, the con- 
solation, the safety and security 
with which we are surrounded, with 
wise counselors inspired of the 
Lord to direct Israel in these mo- 
mentous and wonderful times ; 
and I feel that it is a time of all 
times in the history of this Church 
for Latter-day Saints to live their 
religion, to stand in holy places, and 
"watch the salvation of God," as it 
shall be worked out in the midst of 
the nations of the earth, and fear 
not for the future, so long as we 
keep the commandments of the 
Lord. 

I .doubt not that God lives. His 
providence is over his Church and 
over the world, and a good time is 
coming. I can see behind the dark 
clouds present, the silver lining of 
a better day, the glorious consum- 
mation of those precious promises 
that have inspired the utterances 
of the prophets of God from the 
beginning until this day, that this is 
but preparation for the coming of 
the great Son of God to live upon 
the earth. 

I am loyal to my country. I 
want my young brethren and sisters 
to feel that the institutions founded 
and established in America are 
God-given; the constitution of the 
United States is a revelation from 
the Lord, for all the earth, and not 
only for America ; and that the 
Lord has committed unto this land 
the mission of lifting up an ensign 
to the nations of the earth. And if 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 



121 



the nations of the earth had heeded 
the warning, the invitation and the 
message, no such trouble and mis- 
trust as we now see would have 
been among men. But they would 
not heed ; those who had for ages 
believed that by divine right they 
ruled and governed would not yield 
to God's plan wherein he advised 
when this great instrument was 
established, the constitution of the 
United States, that into the hands 
of the people shall be given the 
right to the people to change the 
rulers and to govern themselves. 
And this is only a short cut to the 
glorious end to establish equity and 
justice in the earth. I cannot help 
but feel that there has been a won- 
derful providence of the Lord over 
America. The Book of Mormon 
is full of promises and predictions 
concerning the future of America. 
It is a land of liberty, and the peo- 
ple shall be preserved against all 
other peoples as long as the people 
of this land serve God and keep his 
commandments. I feel that it is 
also essential and important that we 
shall not lose sight of this latter 
injunction, namely, that if we are 
to hold our place as a nation and be 
ourselves preserved from disrup- 
tion and disintegration, it shall be 
upon the basis that we, not only the 
Latter-day Saints but all the people 
of this land, observe the law of the 
Lord, and believe in God and keep 
his commandments, or chastisement 
shall come also to the peoples of 
this land. I do not fear but that 
even yet, notwithstanding the wick- 
edness that now abounds, the Lord 
loves this nation, and that he still la- 
bors with us, and that he will bring 
us into our right place and position. 
And my heart goes out now in a 
feeling that the present trouble into 
which we are coming is only, per- 



haps, to call us also to repentance. 
I have witnessed in the British 
Columbia section of the Northwest- 
ern states mission, from where so 
many have gone to the war, scarcely 
a home from which a relative has 
not gone, or has had a willingness 
to turn his hand to the defense of 
the 'right. I feel that that spirit of 
stopping and looking and listening 
to the word of the Lord will come 
when from the American homes the 
feeling shall come that is enter- 
tained for loved ones that have 
gone to the front. I feel that it is 
right and proper that we should 
take part in this trouble, that we 
will be more organized and more 
brought back to the ideals of the 
establishers of this great govern- 
ment. 

Some have interpreted Nebu- 
chadnezzar's dream so as to make 
it apply to the establishment of the 
kingdom of God in the latter-days ; 
have interpreted its fulfilment as 
meaning the establishment of 
America. Others have given other 
interpretations. But I can feel in 
my heart a growing love the more 
I know of the gospel of the Son 
of God, the more I appreciate 
America, and the more I love the 
institutions of this land. If there 
is anything that inspires me with 
the glorious mission of America, it 
is the knowledge of the Son of God 
and the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. I can see no compet'tion 
between the mission of the Church 
of Jesus Christ and America among 
the nations of the earth. We have 
largely felt, and we were right 
when we felt, that when the Lord 
spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
he cut a stone out of the mountains 
without hands, so to speak, the 
stone that would roll forth and fill 
the whole earth. This is indeed the 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



work that is to grow and to roll 
forth to fill the whole earth, and I 
am coming to feel in my soul that 
only a part, perhaps, of that great 
vision has reference to us ; and yet 
I am conscious of the fact, or feel 
in my soul, that a part of the mirac- 
ulous work, the kingdom of God, 
unlike the kingdoms of this world, 
which are political, the kingdom of 
Go.d is spiritual, it is religious, and 
it gives to man the consolation that 
in it is found the solution of all the 
problems of life ; and I feel that 
in the two important matters, the 
establishment of the United States 
of America among the nations of 
the earth and the establishment of 
the Church of Jesus Christ again 
in the earth, is the fulfilment of that 
wonderful prophecy. These two 
shall go forth as twin images, and 
not as competitors, one helping and 
sustaining the other. For I believe 
that the most patriotic thing that 
the Latter-day Saints can do is to 
save America and the Americans 
from sin. and from violating the law 
of the Lord, and if they will do 
this, this nation will prevail and 
shall not come to trouble. So that 
I feel that there can be no compe- 
tition to come from the conditions 
we now see being brought about. 
America has lent her powerful in- 
fluence, making it possible in this 
free country for the truth to be 
established and to go unto the na- 
tions of the earth, for the Church 
of Jesus Christ to be organized and 
grow and develop ; protected with 
her tremendous power to protect 
the elders of this Church, and so it 
will be in the future. These two 
will go forward in the future ful- 
filing their mission, and holding up 
to the nations the ensign of free- 
dom and of truth. And other na- 
tions like Russia will shake off their 



shackles and come forth unto their 
own, to the enjoyment of liberty 
and freedom and truth, and right. 
There shall be an emancipation 
of the people, and they shall look 
up to America, and thus these two 
shall go along, equally, and more 
especially working for the princi- 
ples of law and of righteousness in 
politics and in the affairs of men, 
and bringing peace and good will to 
men, which cannot come to mankind 
outside of the adoption and the ac- 
ceptance of the gospel of the Son 
of God. So the greater mission 
rests upon our nation, to go where 
the elders of this Church shall go, 
to extend the message of this gos- 
pel, and to wipe aside the prejudice 
and the darkne ss that rest upon 
the minds of the children of men ; 
and they shall be taught that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that the principles of the gospel of 
the Son of God are true, and will 
emancipate men and bring them 
into the true knowledge of his wis- 
dom and his love. That is my hope, 
and I would not put a straw in the 
way of a patriotic young man who 
wants to enlist in the service of his 
country; but .do not forget the 
other, let him carry with him the 
principles and the love of the truth. 
This country can take part in the 
establishment of righteousness 
politically, but only a few have yet 
carried the mighty responsibility 
of holding the power that 
bears the world's destinies in its 
hands ; for we have been called here, 
not to be isolated from the peoples 
of the world, but to train and teach 
them to go forth as teachers to all 
the world, and it is our mission to 
go and lift up the ensign of this 
gospel to the nations of the earth, 
and only "Mormon" elders can 
do it.

So, as one calling now for re- 
cruits, for soldiers of Christ, I am 
calling for those who do not hesi- 
tate to come, and to those who have 
not yet entered into the ministry of 
the Lord Jesus, and I testify there 
is coming an awakening of our 
brethren and sisters such as we have 
never witnessed before. Thou- 
sands will heed the call where hun- 
dreds ( go today into the field and 
bear off the great and responsible 
work that the Lord has placed upon 
our shoulders. So this, too, is patri- 
otic for America and for the whole 
world. Do not forget it in the 
midst of the enthusiasm of the mo- 
ment. I feel that we should re- 
member our obligations to the Lord 
and to the world. 

I know as I live that this gospel 
is the simple truth, and that no pos- 
sibility ever shall come, now, hence- 
forth nor forever, for men to find 
peace on earth and salvation in the 
kingdom of God without this gos- 
pel. I know it is true. I know that 
the Latter-day Saint boys and girls 
who will stand faithful will win the 
laurels and plaudits of the world. 
I heard a man of national note say 
to a group of our "Mormon" mis- 
sionaries, lately, in the city of Port- 
land, this : He turned to them, and 
asked them, "Do you desire to stand 
in meekness before the world ? If 
von do, stick to the fa'th of your 
fathers, follow their example, for 
what they did is what the world 
wants, and do not follow the fai- 
lancy, the false philosophy and the 
vanity of the world. Stay by the 
standard of your fathers, and you 
will win the highest place of honor 
and distinction in the world." I 
know that is true, and O, after you 
have fought the battle and kept the 
faith, the joy, the consolation and 
the glory of those who win is be- 



yond any power of tongue to de- 
scribe, for you cannot conceive it. 
I know that my Redeemer lives. 
Men may doubt, men may be filled 
with the spirit of uncertainty with 
reference to these troubles; but we 
know, not by reason so much, but 
by the power that touches and con- 
trols us, that God lives and that 
Jesus is the Christ, — know it just as 
I know when I strike your hand 
I feel its pressure upon mine. When 
I put my arm around you, do you 
not feel that I live? Yes. Equally 
sure am I that my Redeemer lives, 
and that he will come again to live 
upon the earth, and that he is with 
this Church. 

God help us as we go now from 
this house to keep the faith, and to 
heed the warning voice of the 
watchmen and servants of the 
Lord, that we may stand blameless 
and secure in safety as we see the 
plans of God working out in the 
midst of the nations of the earth, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang an anthem : "Gos- 
pel restoration," followed by the 
Doxology, and the assembly was 
dismissed by prayer by Elder Grant 
of the Big Horn stake.

ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 

(President of the Bear Lake Stake/) 

My brethren and sisters, and 
friends: I pray that you will give me 
your sympathy, your faith and your 
prayers, that for the short .time I 
may address you, that I may have 
the Spirit of the Lord, that I may 
say something to this assemblage 
that will be profitable. This is a 
new experience to me, and yet this 
sight that I see before me ought to 
be sufficient inspiration to draw 
forth from the speaker the best that 
he has to give. This is certainly a 
most inspiring sight to look upon : 
thousands of the hosts of Israel 
who have gathered on these 
grounds today to hear the word of 
the Lord. 

I have been very much interested 
during the sessions of this confer- 
ence. I have been impressed with 
the thought that it is wonderful that 
the multitudes from various foreign 
countries have assembled here to 
verify and to testify to the divinity 
of this work and the fulfilment of 
prophecy. I remember very well, as 
a small boy listening to two elders 
from Utah speaking in a gravel 
pit in Hampshire, England. I re- 
member distinctly the nature of 
their message to those who came to 
hear them. Though I was but a 
small boy at that time, the words 
which they uttered and the scrip- 
ture they quoted, made a very deep 
impression upon my mind. I re- 
member very distinctly one elder re- 



peating that oft-quoted passage of 
scripture, "Come out of her, O ye 
my people, that ye receive not of 
her sins, and partake not of her 
plagues." I know very well that 
that message has been declared un- 
to many of the nations of the earth 
by the elders of the Church in ful- 
filment of the prophecv contained in 
the New Testament. Hundreds and 
thousands have listened to that 
warning voice, and have gathered 
from nearly every nation under the 
sun. I presume if we were to take 
the time this afternoon to ask of 
this vast multitude here :. What na- 
tions of the earth are represented 
here ? we would find a large num- 
ber represented. 

"Surely the Lord God doeth 
nothing but he revealeth his secrets 
to his servants the prophets." The 
mission of this Church has been and 
is to declare this warning message 
to the nations of the earth. Many 
have listened to the warning voice, 
and hundreds and thousands of 
those who have listened have gath- 
ered to this favored land of Joseph, 
this land that is choice above all 
other lands. They have come here, 
and, instead of being in the unfor- 
tunate condition of hundreds of 
thousands in the older countries, 
they have been permitted to engage 
in the work of the Lord. They 
have worked in the temples of the 
Lord. Their energies have been 
spent in saving the souls of men, 
rather than in the destruction of 
life. 

I do not know what would have 
been my lot had not my father and 
mother, and other members of our 
family, heard the warning voice and 
gathered to Zion. Of one thing I 
am sure, that I would not have 
received the blessings that I have 
received here. Of all people on the 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 



125 



face of the earth, we ought to be 
grateful, my brethren and sisters. 
Of all people in this beloved coun- 
try of ours, there are none who 
can really understand as fully as do 
we, the glorious benefits of this 
country of ours, this adopted coun- 
try of ours ; because, as Latter-day 
Saints, we have a religious convic- 
tion that this nation was estab- 
lished by the inspiration of God our 
heavenly Father. We believe that 
its constitution is an inspired docu- 
ment. We have been taught this in 
our organizations and in all of our 
gatherings throughout the Church. 
It is a part of our faith. We are 
devoted to this country of ours, not 
merely because of the financial ben- 
efits that accrue from being citizens 
of this great country, and that is no 
inconsiderable thing, but because 
we believe that this land, North and 
South America, has been held in 
reservation for the gathering place 
of the House of Israel from all over 
the world. Here, today, are hun- 
dreds and thousands, no doubt, who 
have either gathered from the old 
world or are the sons and daughters 
of those who have come from the 
old world. 

We believe that God intended 
that upon this land the true princi- 
ples of liberty, justice, equality, and 
righteousness should prevail. The 
Lord knew that in the despotic 
governments of the world these 
things could not prevail. He knew 
what the conditions were : and, ac- 
cording to the words of the Lord 
spoken through his prophets, this 
land was dedicated and consecrated 
and set apart for this particular 
purpose. We are here in fulfilment 
of that prophecy. God's Church 
has been established upon this land. 
No other land offered the condi- 
tions that were necessary ; from the 



beginning of this Church up to the 
present time, Latter-day Saints, 
consequently, have had a deep and 
a reverent regard for the govern- 
ment of this land. When I read 
the other day the message of the 
President of our beloved country, 
as he delivered it to Congress, and 
there as the Chief Executive of this 
great country, reiterated the very 
principles which God, through his 
ancient prophets, had written, my 
heart rejoiced. I could see that the 
Lord's word was being fulfilled. 

My brethren and sisters, we need 
not fear as to what the outcome of 
this Nation in her present struggle 
or conflict with other nations may 
be ; because, so long as this govern- 
ment shall stand for the principles 
of liberty and justice, freedom in 
its true sense, and will acknowledge 
God the eternal Father as the giver 
of all good, and defend those prin- 
ciples, God has declared, and you 
may read it in the Book of Mor- 
mon, that he will fight her battles, 
he will guard her interests, he will 
take care of her, and he will fight 
the battles of Zion ! I have no fear 
so far as this Nation is concerned, 
just as long as it will remain true 
and faithful to those sacred princi- 
ples. Loyal and patriotic as they 
may be, no other people fn this 
great country of ours has the deep- 
seated conviction that we have. It 
is a part of our faith, it is a part 
of that which we have been taught 
and believe with all of our hearts to 
be the very truth. As a nation, God 
will protect us, because this is his 
selected spot. It is the spot to 
which all of Israel will gather. 

The Lord will also gather the 
Jews to Jerusalem, just as truly as 
Israel will gather here, and the 
word of the Lord will go forth 
from Jerusalem, and the law of the 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE: 



Lord will go forth from Zion. 
When I read the newspapers and 
see how the Holy Land on the east- 
ern continent is gradually being 
prepared by reason' of this terrible 
catastrophe which has befallen the 
nations through their disobedience, 
I can see how the way is being 
prepared for the return of the Jews 
to Jerusalem. When I saw that 
wonderful achievement wrought in 
Russia, in so short a time, whereby 
religious freedom and the liberty of 
the press was granted to that down- 
trodden people, and when I heard 
of the thousands and thousands of 
the Jewish race who were being 
freed from bondage and slavery, I 
thought I could see again how the 
people of those countries were 
bringing to pass the predictions of 
the servants of the Lord. 

So, if we are faithful and watch- 
ful and prayerful, we can see the 
hand dealings of God every day 
of our lives. We can see the fulfil- 
ment of prophecy every day of our 
lives. I never knew so many proph- 
ecies of the servants of God to be 
fulfilled in so short a time, as have 
been in the last few years. 

We should rejoice that we are in 
possession of these things, in the 
Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine 
and Covenants. See what the Lord 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph. 
Read Section I of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, the preface to the book, 
where the Lord declares that the 
mission of this Church is to go into 
the nations of the earth and warn 
them of the judgment that is to 
come, and the wars and tribulations 
to come upon the nations of the 
earth. These conditions that pre- 
vail in the European countries to- 
day are but the natural result of 
the disobedience and the wicked- 
ness of the people, and that is why 



the Lord has made known to the 
nations through his prophets what 
would co'me to pass. He foresaw 
their wickedness, he knew what 
would be the result of their diso- 
bedience, and many of . the honest 
in heart, many of the House of 
Israel, have been gathered out by 
reason of listening to the warning 
voice of the servants of God. 

Let us remain true and faithful, 
let us rejoice in the thought that 
we are members of the Church of 
Christ restored in our day. Let us 
esteem it the greatest blessing that 
could come to us, and along with 
that ,let us rejoice in the blessed 
thought that we too are citizens of 
the greatest and the noblest and 
the best government upon the face 
of the land, the government under 
which the Church of Christ exists ; 
and we, the Latter-day Saints, be- 
lieving as we do, will be among the 
foremost of the citizenship of this 
country of ours in defending the 
principles for which it stands, of 
proclaiming liberty to all people. 

I am one who is simple-minded 
enough to believe that God Al- 
mighty has already fought the bat- 
tles of our government. I believe 
God was with this country at the 
time of the Revolution. I do not 
think that without the blessing and 
the aid our our heavenly Father, so 
great a work would have been ac- 
complished as was done then. And 
following right down, I believe that 
God was with our navy at Manila 
when that wonderful victory was 
gained by this country. Why? Be- 
cause this country was defending 
those sacred principles for which 
this country stands, and because of 
wh : ch God said that he would 
fight her battles. I have no fear so 
long as we stand for those sacred 
principles, so long as we shall not 



ELDER JOSEPH R. SHEPHERD. 



127 



deviate from them, so long as we 
shall not fight for conquest or 
aggrandizement, but for the exten- 
sion of those sacred principles nec- 
essary for the alleviation of the con- 
dition of the people of the world. 
Just so long shall we be protected 
by Divine Providence. 

This is my testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters. I am thank- 
ful that I am a Latter-day Saint. I 
want to be true to the covenants 
that I have made ; and we want the 
world to know, and everyone in 
this country to know, that there are 
no more faithful, loyal people up- 
on this land, or people who have a 
higher regard for the principles of 
this government, or will do more 
to maintain those principles, than 
will the Latter-day Saints. We be- 
lieve in the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and this is 
the message that he delivered to 
this people. Through him we have 
received this knowledge, and be- 
cause of it we believe that we will 
be foremost in the defense of these 
things. 

May God help us to be true and 
faithful as members of his Church, 
and when we are true and faithful 
Latter-day Saints, we are the high- 
est type of American citizenship 
that can be produced. May God 
help us to be so! Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD. 

(President of the Alberta Stake, 
Canada.) 

I am from Canada, "men of the 
North are we." We have been at 
war, assisting our mother country 
for upwards of three years. Hav- 
ing been born here in Salt Lake, 
but now being a citizen of Canada, 
I am pleased with the attitude of 
my Uncle Sam. 



We have nearly fifty of our finest 
young men right at the front in 
France today. Before they went, 
a great number of people volun- 
teered their services. When the re- 
cruiting officers came in our section 
of the country, they did not go 
among the people as they had done 
among other people, but they came 
in our Tabernacle and asked that 
we suit ourselves in volunteering 
our services. In doing that, they 
received the aid and the assistance 
of our home militia, the finest body 
of young men in all western Can- 
ada, "Mormon" boys, who had 
spent upwards of seven years in 
training, about ten days each year, 
and who had won high honor in all 
the competitions open to the home 
guard of Canada. They were the 
boys, seventy-five of them, who 
kept the Word of Wisdom, every 
one of them, and they were com- 
mented upon by the highest mili- 
tary officers of Canada. When we 
spoke about those who should vol- 
unteer, the officers said, "Give us 
these boys ; we know them." 

The boys came, and under the 
hands of those who preside, re- 
ceived their blessings, and not one 
has been lost in all the armies of 
Europe among the Allied portion, 
which we represent and of which we 
form a part. 

When the time comes for any of 
you to volunteer, let it be said that 
the very best young men go. I see 
the wisdom of President Wilson's 
suggestion that possibly conscrip- 
tion should be put in force : they 
want the good men to go, and to 
get them, they may need to call 
them. 

Not long ago, we had one of our 
missionaries from Switzerland, who 
was doing missionary work in Ger- 
many. He told of a circumstance 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



which shows to me that the "Mor- 
mon" people have not any enmity 
in their hearts. I do not believe any 
of us desire to kill a German or an 
Austrian or any of the Teutonic 
nations in war, except as we may be 
called upon to defend ourselves. 
Imagine on the field of battle a 
German member of this Church re- 
ceiving also under the hands of the 
missionaries a blessing that he 
should go in battle, and that he 
would not lose his life. The mis- 
sionary states that this particular 
young man went to the front, his 
battalion was called to charge upon 
the English, and he noticed after 
the charge that very few were left. 
They were commanded a second 
time to charge. He remembered the 
blessing that he should not lose his 
life, and, he said, they made the 
charge, and all he could then re- 
member was that he should not be 
called upon to shed blood nor lose 
his life, and he wondered how it 
would come to pass. After the 
charge" was made the next he re- 
membered was that he was in a 
hospital in Berlin. 

Our boys from Canada had the 
same blessing given to them. Imag- 
ine a Canadian and a German 
"Mormon" boy meeting on the field 
of battle, each with that promise 
that they would not be called upon 
to shed blood nor lose their life in 
battle. Can you see any better so- 
lution to universal peace than by 
and through the sensing of religion 
as we feel it as Latter-day Saints, 
commonly called "Mormons" ? So 
much for the war. 

I am pleased to be with you to- 
day, this Easter day. We heard in 
the Tabernacle yesterday and this 
morning some very splendid dis- 
courses upon the theme of the res- 
urrection of the body, from a Scrip- 



tural standpoint. Let me take the 
time to tell you something outside 
of the Scripture, which has come 
under my personal observation. 

We have to the north and the 
south of our country Indian reser- 
vations. We have recently had an 
Indian by the name of Brother 
Warner, from Parker, Idaho, come 
up and do missionary work among 
the Blood and Blackfoot Indians 
across the border in Montana from 
our country. He and a young man 
named Galbraith — you saw his pic- 
ture in the Era a few months ago, 
where he was in Washington and 
introduced to the President of the 
United States. He went there in 
behalf of the Indians on the reser- 
vation in making their allotments. 
His mother was an Indian, a Black- 
foot woman. His father was an 
honorable Scotchman living very 
close to our country on the Black- 
foot reservation. 

This Brother Galbraith had a 
dream. He said he came to our 
meeting. He saw in the meeting, 
in his dream, four or five old Indian 
chiefs siting on the stand. He 
knew these Indians were dead and 
had been for a long time. One of 
them was his uncle. The highest 
point on the Rocky Mountains near 
us was called Old Chief. That was 
the name of his uncle, the highest 
chief among the Blackfoot nation. 
He said as he went into the audi- 
ence that this uncle of his told him 
to come up on the stand with him, 
and he said he wondered how it 
was, because this man was dead ; 
he knew this. He went up and he 
heard his uncle stand up and preach 
a sermon to the audience there and 
turn around and say, "This nephew 
of mine must be our representative 
among our people." Be it said to 
Brother Galbraith's honor that al- 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD. 



129 



though a half-breed Indian, he hon- 
ors his race and is never ashamed 
of his Indian blood. He said the 
man spoke in a language he could 
understand, and he marveled at it. 

When he got to this, Brother 
Galbraith said, "What have I got to 
do ?" He said, "You see a book on 
the table" — and he pointed to a 
book on the table — "that book con- 
tains the history of our people. We 
are what people call all dead, and 
you are in the life, with the book. 
It will be told to you what to do." 
He awoke, and after two long 
years of investigating, he joined 
the Church. 

When Brother Warner came up, 
by permission of President Ballard, 
he went over and visited Brother 
Galbraith, and they went among the 
Indians, and they aroused a lot of 
interest among the Indians, and 
held a meeting in a half-caste's 
house. There sat in a corner a 
lady, a chief's daughter, and a man 
by her side, who was a half-caste. 
Brother Galbraith said when he 
looked down on those two they be- 
came almost white in his eyes. 
Whenever he spoke about the Book 
of Mormon the lady would appar- 
ently go white, and he marveled 
at it. When he got through the man 
stood up and said, "I know more 
about that book than you do, 
Brother Galbraith. I can see that. 
Let me tell you what I know. For 
three consecutive years I have 
taken my family and gone off into 
the woods, and when I got there 
(the first year was 1914), pitched 
my tepee and went off in the forest. 
I was told by a man who came there 
to meet me that I was to lie down 
under the trees, wrap my blankets 
around me, and go with him on a 
journey. So I did it. I went right 
off, and looked down on my body 



when I went with this visitor — 
saw an Indian there wrapped in his 
blankets, and I wondered how it 
was that I was living and yet it was 
I there wrapped in my own blank- 
ets. I wondered if anybody would 
come along and bury my body be- 
fore I returned. We were gone a 
day, and the visitor had taught me, 
oh, so many things — many things 
you would not believe if I told you. 
because my own family do not be- 
lieve them. The messenger said I 
was to come in 1915, and I did it. 
I went again on the journey. In 
1916 the messenger said to me, 
after taking the usual, trip and see- 
ing my body there wrapped in my 
blankets as before — and after the 
whole tribe called me a visionary 
man — said, 'During this year you 
will have a little dark man come 
to you with a book. That is the 
book that will tell you of the history 
of your people.' " 

The man stood up and said, 
"There is the little dark man, 
Brother Warner. I saw him here 
yesterday. He had the book in his 
hand. The old Indian told him to 
give me the book, and I have longed 
for it for three years. And he took 
it and wrapped it in what they call 
their sacred cloth, and said to the 
man, "Brother Warner, this is my 
book, not yours." 

He did not want anything to do 
with the Church at all — when they 
held a public meeting he went off 
among the Indians and got an in- 
terpreter to read the Book of Mor- 
mon to them. 

He saw his body. That is what 
I want to impress upon you. A 
great many of us Latter-day Saints 
have vague ideas of what the resur- 
rection actually is. I was pleased 
to feel that today we could hold 
General conference on the day com- 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



memorated as the day of the resur- 
rection of Jesus Christ. Yet how 
few really look upon the resurrec- 
tion as I saw it, in my experience 
on the islands of the Navigator 
Group, in 1889. 

A young man from Provo — a 
great many know him, but I will 
not mention his name because what 
happened to him did not do him 
much good — was told by his mother 
not to go in bathing. We had 
been accustomed to bathing every 
day in the ocean, and had become 
good swimmers before this young- 
man arrived. I coaxed him to go 
in swimming- with us in the ocean. 
Those of you who have come from 
the old country know what it looks 
like on the beach when the tide is 
out. Those islands are surround- 
ed by a coral reef, and in the reef 
there are large holes, ten to eigh- 
teen feet deep, and when the tide 
is out, we wind our way, guarding 
ourselves from the holes, until we 
come to the edge of the reef. Then 
we dive out into deep water, where 
we used to anchor our boat. 

I coaxed this young man to go. 
We got our bathing suits, and he 
followed me out. I wound my way 
through the coral reef, and swam 
out to where three others of our 
elders were. When I got there, one 
of the other brethren said, "Did 
not that brother follow you out?" 
I said, "Yes." But I looked around 
and could not see him' anywhere. 
He had told me he could not swim, 
and I thought he was bathing in 
the shallow water. 

We swam to the reef and hunted 
around and saw the young man in 
about twelve feet of water, in the 
attitude of prayer. We dove down, 
lifted his body up, and brought it 
up to the beach. Blood was com- 
ing from his ears and mouth and 



nose. We worked with him until 
we could see that he was dead. 

You can hardly imagine my feel- 
ings, feeling myself almost respon- 
sible for the death of that young- 
man. The natives gathered around 
and said, "It is sacreligious to work 
with a body after it is dead." But 
I suggested to the mission presi- 
dent that we take him into a house, 
dress him in his garments, and ad- 
minister to him. Then I should 
feel more satisfied. We worked for 
over forty minutes with that young 
man's body, carried him onto the 
beach with his head down, his feet 
on my shoulders. No sign of life 
at all. 

We laid his body on a table, with 
over five hundred natives witness- 
ing the ceremony of the anointing 
with oil. We anointed him and we 
blessed him. I felt his eyes move 
under my hands, and he awoke 
and came to, and asked us to place 
him up on the table and he would 
tell us what he saw, "before I for- 
get it," he said, "for I can feel it 
Ls going from me just like I might 
be leaving a room." 

He said, "I called, when I got in- 
to deep water. You paid no atten- 
tion to me, and the last thing that 
I thought of was of my mother's 
admonishing me to always pray in 
time of danger. When you took 
my body out of the water I was 
with you. When you walked up 
and down the beach I walked up 
and down with you. I saw my body. 
I prayed to God with all my soul 
that you would not bury me nor 
consider me dead until you exer- 
cised the power of your priesthood. 
I was told by something that it was 
the priesthood that had the power 
to return my spirit to my body. 
I watched you all the time. I won- 
dered why you did not do it, hav-

iiig this glorious ordinance in the 
Church. You elders apparently 
were going to forget all about it. 
And oh, how glorious, when you 
exercised your priesthood and an- 
ointed me with oil in the name of the 
Son of God and through the priest- 
hood which you had ! As soon as 
you said that, my spirit body en- 
tered my physical body." I am here 
to testify unto you what I know to 
be a positive fact. 

This, to me, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is the power of God unto sal- 
vation to those who obey and be- 
lieve. By that power does the res- 
urrection of the body come. I do 
not care what anybody says about 
this resurrection "fallacy," as our 
esteemed friends term it sometimes. 
I saw that thing happen, call it 
what you will. 

God bless you. Amen. 

A double male quartet from the 
Swedish choir sang : "Your mother 
is praying for you." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. CHIPMAN. 

(President of the Alpine Stake.) 

-My beloved brethren and sisters, 
and friends: I appreciate having 
been present this afternoon, in list- 
ening to the testimony and the ex- 
hortation that has been given by the 
brethren who have preceded me. I 
am here in response to the call of 
the President to say a few words, 
and I trust that I can enjoy the 
same sweet influence that has actu- 
ated the brethren who have pre- 
ceded me. 

I was particularly impressed with 
the strong testimony that was borne 
by President Wood, of the power 
of God in behalf of this young man, 
and also with the story that was re- 
lated of the brother in the North ; 



and I was led in my mind to the 
scriptural passage concerning Nico- 
demus, who came to the Savior and 
wanted to know from him what he 
should do. The Savior told him, 
and Nicodemus marveled at what 
was told him, and could not under- 
stand it, and the Savior made this 
remark, "The wind bloweth where 
it listeth, and thou hearest the 
sound thereof, but canst not tell 
whence it cometh, and whither it 
goeth : so is every one that is born 
of the Spirit." I thought of the 
power of God that was manifest in 
behalf of our brother, that Brother 
Wood could not understand how it 
was brought about, could not com- 
prehend it. We do not understand 
it any more than we understand 
where this breeze that is blowing 
this afternoon comes from and 
where it goes, but we do know 
that it is so, and he said that he 
knew that God raised him up by 
his power. 

And yet, sometimes our young 
people are skeptical and want to 
reason out everything by the rea- 
son of man before they believe it is 
true. I want to say to the Latter- 
day Saints present, and especially 
our young men and young women, 
that the things of God are not un- 
derstood by the reasoning of man, 
but they are understood by the 
Spirit of. God, and "the wind blow- 
eth where it listeth, and thou hear- 
est the sound thereof, but canst not 
tell whence it cometh and whither it 
goeth." We see this power and, as 
Brother Wood said, we know of a 
surety that it is of God. When we 
testify that we know these things, 
we know it because we feel it, and 
while we may not always be able to 
explain to the comprehension of our 
young people just how we know it, 
we know it just as well as we 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



know that we live. We want to live 
by this power and testimony, so that 
we will cling to the iron rod, and 
will not be led astray by the wisdom 
and by the cunning craftiness of 
men. For this reason God has 
established in the Church men to 
lead and guide and direct us, and 
it is up to us to have faith and con- 
fidence in these men. 

I will say, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I represent the Alpine 
stake of Zion, comprised of seven- 
teen wards, in the north end of 
Utah ' county, a part of the old 
Utah stake. Our stake has been 
organized since the year 1901, and 
we have been presiding in that lo- 
cality at the base of the noble 
Timpanogos mountain and by the 
beautiful Utah lake of fresh water. 
We have a garden spot, a most 
beautiful place to live, and have in 
that locality a gathering of God's 
people, who are industrious, who 
are serving the Lord, building up 
the country, and developing and 
growing in righteousness and good 
works, and we are raising up a 
class of young people in our com- 
munities who are faithful and true. 

However, some of our young 
men and young women are careless 
and neglectful, with all our schools, 
our churches, priesthood quorums, 
improvement associations, and the 
other organizations which God has 
inspired his servants to organize in 
our midst. We have much careless- 
ness, indifference, and forgetful- 
ness, and some who lack respect for 
the priesthood of God, and for their 
parents and those who preside over 
them in the Church. We are labor- 
ing with them and trying to impress 
them with faith in God, with good 
works, that they may grow up to 
be useful men and women in the 
Kingdom of God. 



I will say, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I do not desire to talk 
long. My voice is weak. I am just 
recovering now from an operation, 
and I am afraid that I will injure 
my voice. But I know as I stand 
here that this is the work of God. 
I have seen his power, I have seen 
the fulfilment of his promises, and 
my desire is that I may so live that I 
may enjoy that spirit and be able to 
impress others unto good works, 
that they may take mind to them- 
selves, and grow up to be useful 
men and women in the Church of 
God and in this great Government 
of which we form a part. And may 
we have this loyalty and testimony 
and spirit burning in our hearts for- 
ever, I humply pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 

(President of the Fremont Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters and 
friends, I was especially interested 
in. the story that was told us -by 
Brother Wood. Sometime before 
Brother Warner went on this 
mission, as he lives in the section of 
the country from whence I have 
come recently, I was on the train 
with him, and he said to me, 
"Brother Austin, I feel strongly 
impressed that I should say to the 
president of this stake, 'President 
Miller, I should have a mission to 
go unto my people.' " And I learned 
later that he had gone, and now we 
have learned in regard to that mis- 
sion. Therefore I am specially in- 
terested, because I said to him, 
"You should see your president, and 
notify your brethren of your feel- 
ings in regard to this matter. You 
are impressed, no doubt, with the 
proper spirit in behalf of your kin- 
dred." Brother Warner is a very 



ELDER MARK AUSTIN. 



133 



scholarly, talented gentleman, a 
very excellent man, a splendid type 
among us, and he has performed 
a very wonderful mission accord- 
ing to the report and testimony of 
President Wood. 

My brethren and sisters, it is 
about twenty years since I spoke in 
the open air in the land of my fath- 
ers, to which I was called about 
twenty years ago — upon the streets 
of old England, carrying the mes- 
sage which had been revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph for the salvation of 
the children of men, and I rejoice 
in that work. I rejoice today, I am 
glad that I am identified with this 
people who have settled in these 
magnificent valleys. The testimony 
of their worth is on every hand, and 
the words that have been spoken 
by the brethren certainly must have 
found lodgment in our hearts, and 
will bear fruit if we desire to serve 
God and keep his commandments, 
and we have in our hearts to do 
good unto the children of men. 

I do not .desire to take further 
time. I want to hear from Brother 
Callis, a man who is capable and 
who is on the firing line and who is 
laboring for the establishment of 
the truth in the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men, that the peace that 
men are looking for may come. 
There is no possible peace without 
truth. God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang in the Swedish 
language : "The Prince of Peace." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 

(Fresident of the Southern States 
Mission.) 

The words which the President 
of the Church addressed to as- 
sembled Israel in the first session 
of this great conference were the 
words of a prophet and a states- 



man. They were more, they were 
the word of God unto this people. 

The newspapers carried a state- 
ment a day or two ago that this 
nation's resources which she would 
assemble for war beneath her star- 
ry flag were inexhaustible and 
greater than the resources of any 
other nation in ancient or modern 
times. Have we anything more 
under this flag? Yes, we have the 
noblest manhood and the noblest 
womanhood in the world. 

Are these sufficient? No. What 
more do we need? What is our 
daily need in war or in peace? It 
is God. The nation whose God is 
the Lord shall never be hurled 
down to defeat and disaster. It is 
remarkable how the great men of 
the earth are beginning to contem- 
plate the greatness of this nation 
and are beginning to see that this 
nation will lead in the path of peace 
and that she has forces to redeem 
the old world from the evils which 
have produced this war which is 
drenching the ground of the old 
world with blood. Listen to the 
words of the American historian, 
John Lord: 

"But has America a higher des- 
tiny than to repeat the old ex- 
periments and improve upon them 
and become rich and powerful? 
Has she no higher and nobler mis- 
sion? Can she lay hold of forces 
that the old world never had, such 
as will prevent the uniform doom 
of "nations? If America has a great 
mission to declare and to fulfil, 
she must put forth altogether new 
forces, and these not material. And 
these alone will save her and save 
the world. 

"We believe America was dis- 
covered not so much to furnish a 
field for infinite material expan- 
sion with European arts and fash- 



134

ions, which would simply assim- 
ilate America to the old world, 
with all its dangers and vices and 
follies, but to introduce new forms 
of government, new social insti- 
tutions, new customs and manners, 
new experiments in liberty, new 
religious organizations. * * * 
Unless something new is born here 
which has a _ peculiar power to 
save, wherein will America ulti- 
mately differ from other parts of 
Christendom ?" 

Has America introduced new 
forms of government? The an- 
swer to that is the sound of crash- 
ing and tottering thrones, which 
is being borne to our ears on the 
winds that are sweeping across the 
ocean. When that declaration rang 
out by the inspiration of God that 
all men are created equal,- then 
thrones began to hotter, then the 
cheeks of monarchs blanched, and 
their knees trembled beneath them. 

Is there anything else that Amer- 
ica has? Has America laid hold 
of forces which will save her arid 
save the old world from the doom 
which shall come upon them if 
this something new is not given to 
them? Yes, America has something 
new. Something new has been 
born upon this soil What is it? It 
is the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. It is the holy priesthood 
that has been restored from heaven, 
which is the authority to act in 
God's name to preach the gospel 
and to officiate in the ordinances 
thereof. 

My brethren and sisters, what are 
the enemies that this mighty re- 
public has need to fear? It does 
not fear men or nations. Under 
its flag will march the bravest of 
the brave. Let me tell you the en- 
emies we must guard against : The 
desecration of the Lord's day. That 



is one evil which is a reproach upon 
our national conduct. The immola- 
tion of virtue and chastity upon the 
alter of lust in the great centers of 
our great republic is another evil. 
This mad pursuit after pleasure, 
this forsaking the things of God for 
cisterns "that can hold no water," 
this worshiping of mammon instead 
of the true and the living God, this 
speculative spirit that seems to rest 
upon the people of the nation, the 
lust for gold — will result in disas- 
ter so sure as God lives if not 
checked. These are the evils which 
will sap the virtue and strength 
out of our national institutions, be- 
cause when the home is under- 
mined, when the influence of the 
home is weakened, then the power, 
the prestige and the might of this 
great republic is correspondingly 
weakened. 

Ah, my beloved brethren and sis- 
ters, let us not forget that the bat- 
tle is the Lord's, and as he is the 
God of battles, let the American 
people walk in unison with his laws, 
esteeming virtue, championing the 
cause of chastity, denouncing the 
awful crime of race suicide, encour- 
aging people who are married to 
give legitimate expression to the 
God-given powers of fatherhood 
and motherhood, by obeying that 
divine law, "multiply, and replenish 
the earth." Thank God that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints upholds the sanctity of 
the home, encourages men and 
women to bring up their children 
in the fear of the Lord. Upon the 
brow of a true Latter-day Saint is 
not written, "wife deserter." 

When Saul was anointed king of 
Israel, the prophet Samuel said to 
him, "And the Spirit of the Lord 
will come upon thee, and thou shalt 
prophesy with them, and shalt be 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS. 



135 



turned into another man." And 
the Bible records that as Saul went 
from the presence of Samuel, "God 
gave him another heart." Oh, that 
is what we as a nation need to pray 
for. Pray with David, "Create in 
me a clean heart, O God ; and re- 
new a right spirit within me." 
When a man repents of his sins 
and brings forth fruits meet for re- 
pentance, is he not another man? 
Does not God give him another 
heart, a new heart ? 

It is my good fortune to labor 
with many young men, your sons, 
from the valleys of the mountains, 
in the Southern States mission. 
They have come to the mission in- 
experienced boys, many of them, 
and I have had a heart to heart 
talk with every one of them. I 
have seen those young men go out 
into the mission field, they have 
preached upon the streets, they 
have sometimes faced hostile audi- 
ences, but the power of God has 
rested upon them, and when they 
went about their duty God has 
turned them into other men ; he has 
giyen them another heart. 

So, my brethren and sisters, if 
the people will put all manner of 
evil beneath their feet ; if they will 
turn wholly to God : if they will set 
their faces as flint against those 
evils which are vexing mankind, 
God will give them new hearts, and 
by obeying the gospel, they will 
become better and stronger. What 
bondage is there to be compared 
to the bondage of sin? What load 
can a man carry that is so awful 
and so blighting in its effects as a 
conscience racked with the tor- 
ments of hell ? There is no autoc- 
racy, there is no despotism, there 
is no monarchy so cruel, so hard 
upon a man as the despotism of sin, 
of a conscience burdened with guilt. 



I plead with men who are tor- 
mented with the knowledge that 
they have done wrong, to repent 
before God, to go to him, to hate 
sin, to bring forth fruits meet for 
repentance, and when a man does 
go to the Father with a humble 
heart and a contrite spirit, the peace 
of God that passeth all understand- 
ing will fill his soul, and then he 
will know that there is no freedom 
so sweet, no happiness so deep and 
enduring as the peace and the joy 
that spring from serving the Lord 
and keeping all his commandments. 

Oh, mav the soldiers that go 
from our beloved states in the West 
go with the spirit which the 2,000 
young Lanianites had. They said 
to their prophet leader Helaman : 
"Father, behold our God is with us, 
and he will not suffer that we shall 
fall." And Helaman said that these 
young men "had been taught by 
their mothers, that if they did not 
doubt, that God would deliver 
them. And- they rehearsed unto me 
the words of their mothers, saying, 
we do not doubt our mothers knew 
it." 

Mothers in Israel, your sons may 
not be called upon to go into the 
battle rank, but they will go to fight 
a harder battle, perhaps. They may 
have to meet the temptations, the 
vices, and the evils of the world, 
which are ever threatening the 
overthrow of young people. I ask 
you, mothers, as a servant of God 
to continue to teach your sons that 
if they will be virtuous and chaste, 
and have faith in God, that' their 
lives will not be scarred with these 
awful evils, and that thev will not 
sacrifice the precious birthright 
which Go'l hath given unto them 
in being born children of the cov- 
enant. 

I beg of you mothers and you 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fathers to teach your daughters 
that they, too, have to fight a stren- 
uous battle. God bless and protect 
the womanhood of this nation ! 
The young women, under the sus- 
taining prayers and the counsels of 
their mothers, need the restraining 
discipline which , characterizes a 
well-ordered home. Protect the 
young men and young women, and 
build them up in the faith of the 
true and the living God, so that 
when they go forth in the great 
battle of life, they will have the as- 
surance that they will not fall vic- 
tims to the evils of the world. God 
help us to be loyal to him, to give 
unto him all the praise and the 
glory. And if we go forth to bat- 
tle, let -us remember that the great 
God of the whole earth, Jesus 
Christ, is the King of the American 
people. As we walk under the 
Star-spangled Banner, let peace 
and charity and mercy and prayer 
abide in our hearts, that we may 
be worthy to be soldiers of this God- 
established republic and soldiers of 
the Cross, true children of the God 
of Israel, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The authorities were sustained 
unanimously as in the Tabernacle 
meeting. 

The choir sang: "Song of the 
Redeemed." 

Prayer by Bishop John R. Win- 
ter, of Rexburg, Idaho. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle the conference 
was called to order at 2 p. m., by 
President Joseph F. Smith, who 
presided. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the 
anthem : "Come unto me." 



Prayer was offered by Elder Wm. 
A. Hyde, president of the Pocatello 
stake of Zion. 

Horace S. Ensign and William 
Worley sang a duet : " Come unto 
him, all ye who weep." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Our religion not a thing apart from 
life — The laws of the gospel provide 
for physical health, temporal suc- 
cess, educational development, eth- 
ical culture, social purity, music, 
art, and all that therein is true and 
beautiful — The laws of the Church 
teach loyalty and the true relation 
of Church and State — They encour- 
age the acceptable home life, proper 
marriage relations, and define the 
true relationship of man to God and 
man to man — The brotherhood in 
the Priesthood of God the most 
satisfactory known to men — It is 
the true fraternity of God and 
brotherhood ,of man — All worth 
having in life may be obtained with- 
in the pale of the gospel which com- 
pletes the full circle of require- 
ments of a hviman life — May we all 
learn to live to be worthy of its 
truths. 

I cannot tell you with what dif- 
ficulty I have approached this un- 
dertaking. When I realize that the 
body of the Church has come up to 
Zion for counsel and guidance, to 
hear the word of the Lord, and that 
in a measure a portion of that re- 
sponsibility of giving the word of 
the Lord to the people of the 
Church, rests even but slightly upon 
me, I am almost overwhelmed. I 
have prayed to our Father for the 
guidance of his Spirit, and I appeal 
to you, my brethren and sisters, for 
your sympathetic co-operation, in 
the hope that I may be able to say 
something that will be of profit to 
the Latter-day Saints. I recognize 
the fact that but a comparatively 
small portion of the total number 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



137 



of the Church members are here 
present, but I also recognize the 
fact that the whole of the Church 
is here represented and that the 
priesthood of the Church, which 
presides over it in its various de- 
partments, is here present in a very 
large number, and that there are 
present a sufficiently large number 
of the people of the Church to touch 
the lives of all those who claim 
membership therein. 

I, with you, have received great 
joy and satisfaction in the words 
that have been spoken to us in the 
sessions of our general conference. 
It seems to me that all queries that 
were within our minds as we came 
from up and down the land to this 
central place of meeting for advice 
and counsel have been answered, 
and that all of the questions which 
have troubled us in these momen- 
tous times have received such 
treatment and discussion as to sat- 
isfy our souls and direct us in our 
course of action. I have been in- 
tensely impressed with the prac- 
ticality, the beneficient practicality, 
of the teachings of our religion. 

We came together two .days ago 
with our hearts and thoughts bent 
upon discovery of a true course of 
action for us to follow as individ- 
uals, as a people, in the great prob- 
lems that present themselves to us, 
and I feel sure that each person 
who has listened to the counsel of 
our brethren, and has heard the 
principles of the gospel expounded 
by divine inspiration has received 
guidance and direction for himself 
personally, as well as for the great 
body of the people. President 
Smith, in his opening remarks, sug- 
gested that the brethren who might 
follow him would see fit to touch 
upon and emphasize some of the 
cardinal principles of the gospel, 



which were mentioned by him so 
forcefully in his opening address, 
and in conformity to that sugges- 
tion most of the important princi- 
ples of the gospel, which affect us 
at this time and are calculated to 
determine our course of conduct, 
have been dwelt upon in such man- 
ner as to make plain to us our 
duties. 

Our religion is not a thing apart 
from our life. It is incorporated in 
it, and forms a part of the very tis- 
sue and sinews of our being. It 
provides a rule of conduct and of 
action for us, not only in our oc- 
casional worship but in our lives, in 
our work, in our play, in all that 
we do in the whole course of our 
conduct. It is this intense prac- 
ticality of it that appeals to me as 
its greatest strength, constituting 
its greatest salvation for the hu- 
man family. There has been in 
times past, to my thinking, too much 
of Sunday reh'gion. There is com- 
paratively too much of that notion 
that our religious views are to be 
considered separate and apart from 
the lives we live, and that has led to 
a devitalization of the religion 
which has been professed by Chris- 
tianity ; for modern man, if he is 
anything, is practical, — he desires 
to see the end of that which he be- 
gins, — the application of the truth 
which he considers, and if it can- 
not be demonstrated to him that re- 
ligion, as a profession of belief, will 
work out in his every day life an 
influence, that will develop for him 
success, happiness and joy, he can- 
not be made to be interested in re- 
ligion. Within the purview of the 
gospel, there has been given to us, 
as I view it, a remedy for every ill, 
a precaution for every evil into 
which we might fall, and a safe- 
guard against all harm.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



To those who would have health 
and enjoy the blessings that come 
from healthful bodies, there is the 
Word of Wisdom given to the 
Church in its earliest days as a 
guiding principle in the conduct of 
their lives. How much the world 
needs that principle today! How 
much benefit and good would come 
to humanity at large if they could 
but understand and adopt in their 
lives those simple and comprehen- 
sive principles and truths taught in 
that which we denominate the 
Word of Wisdom. 

There are those who seek after 
temporal success, who seek to bring 
to themselves wealth, renown, and 
power. The gospel provides a plan 
whereby that success, in righteous- 
ness, may be attained. The law of 
tithing, as laid down in the Church 
and as practiced by the Church, to 
my thinking is the surest guide to 
follow in the accomplishment of 
success in our temporal affairs, and 
I bear you my testimony, as you 
have heard it from thousands of 
men and women in the Church, that 
those who will obey the Lord's law 
of tithing and contribute of their 
substance that which is demanded 
of them, for the Lord and his work, 
will prosper in their temporal af- 
fairs. The gospel teaches frugality, 
thrift, industry, — all of those com- 
ponant qualities that go to make the 
successful, happy, prosperous citi- 
zen of our land. 

There are those who seek after 
culture of the mind, who see in the 
development of the intellectual pro- 
cesses the great height of ambition 
for which they strive. There is no 
religion, there is no philosophy, so 
far as I know, which accentuates 
human intelligence as does the gos- 
pel of Jesus Chrst. "The glory 
of God is intelligence," and to one 



who holds that view the culture of 
his mind assumes a broader, a big- 
ger, a finer view point than can pos- 
sibly be had by anyone who does 
not so regard it. 

The Church has promulgated and 
stands for the most complete sys- 
tem of ethics and morals that the 
world has ever known. It was 
highly gratifying to learn not long 
ago that a company engaged in 
disseminating news, in looking for 
one to write for the newspapers 
which they published, an article de- 
voted to "social purity," had se- 
lected our own beloved . president, 
believing that he, representing the 
people of the Latter-day Saints, 
could write a better article upon the 
subject of social purity than could 
be obtained from any other source. 
We believe and know that to be 
true, because we profess what we 
practice in that regard. 

To those who look for the beauti- 
ful in art and in music, and who 
would dedicate and consecrate 
their lives, as many have done, to 
development along these lines, our 
religion offers encouragement of 
the highest type and order. I think 
that it can be safely said that there 
are no communities to be found 
anywhere in which the love of mu- 
sic is developed to a higher degree 
than among the communities of the 
Latter-day Saints. I doubt if there 
can be found any people upon the 
face of the globe who love to sing, 
to praise God in song, whose songs 
come from the heart more than do 
the Latter-day Saints. Our love of 
art in its true sense is exemplified 
in our temples and majestic edifices 
that have been erected for the wor- 
ship of God, and to all who love 
that which is beautiful and true' in 
the arts, and in the sciences as well, 
our Church, our religion, offers en-

couragement and provides a broad 
plan of understanding whereby all 
may be comprehended in its true 
light. 

We have been favored at this 
conference with more than one ex- 
position of the attitude of our peo- 
ple and our Church toward the gov- 
ernment in which we live. I feel 
safe in making the statement that 
there can be found in no place hi 
this great republic men and women 
more devotedly consecrated to the 
principles of liberty and freedom 
for which our nation stands than 
our own Latter-day Saints. Why 
should it not be? Do we, perhaps, 
not owe more to the protecting care 
oi the government than any other 
people? Have we not more reason 
to be greatful for liberty and for 
freedom than the people of any 
other section of our great republic ? 
Brother Ivins said, in eloquent 
language, that th's government has 
been the guardian of the Church. 
Certain it is that it has afforded us 
opportunity to develop the great 
truths which have been revealed in 
the gospel, and certain it is that we 
love it and that we are willing as 
a people to protect it in every way 
that is necessary. I was also much 
impressed by a further statement 
made upon this subject in that our 
religion teaches us the true relation 
of Church and State, and affords us 
a solution to that much agitated 
problem that has concerned our 
people at many times. It teaches 
us that we live under a constitution 
which was wrought out at the hands 
of divinely inspired men and that 
that constitution is our safeguard 
against encroachments upon princi- 
ples of justice, of truth, and of lib- 
erty, and so I say there can be no 
more loyal, no more patriotic men 
and women, from the Atlantic to 



the Pacific, than can be found in 
these few small states that harbor 
the Latter-day Saints. 

If you would build a home filled 
with love and charity and divine af- 
fection, you can go to no place that 
will give you a more adequate con- 
ception of the proper way to rear 
and maintain a family, of the prop- 
er way to lay the foundations of a 
home than among the Latter-day 
Saints. The gospel has revealed to 
us higher and loftier principles in 
connection with the marital status, 
in relation to parents' relationship 
to their children, than has ever come 
to man in all the history of the 
world from the time of the Savior 
down to the time when the restored 
gospel came to earth, never to be 
taken away again. And how fun- 
damentally important it is that, we 
should have revealed to us, made 
known a plan to us, by which to 
make good homes, for I tell you a 
great nation can no more exist with- 
out good homes than it can exist 
without the loyalty and patriotism 
of a devoted citizenship. It is im- 
possible that we should have a 
great country, fulfiling the lofty 
purposes of its destiny, unless we 
have good homes throughout the 
land. It is my humble belief that 
there are to be found among our 
people more good, true, honorable, 
simple homes than can be found 
among any other people in this 
great, wide world. I believe there 
are more fathers who are fathers in 
very deed, who honor their wives, 
the mothers of their children, as 
they should honor them, there are 
more good women consecrating and 
devoting their lives to their children 
and their husbands and their 
homes. I think there are more 
true children loving their fathers 
and loving their mothers and their 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



homes with a great unselfish love, to 
be found among- our own people 
than can be found upon the face of 
this globe; and I thank God that 
this is true. God bless our homes. 
Our homes are the foundation of 
the nation. They are the corner 
stone of society itself. If the good 
old-fashioned American home, as 
we have it, should vanish from the 
earth nothing could take its place 
and there would come faster than 
there is now coming in many sec- 
tions of the country, decay by rea- 
son of its absence. 

But I think the one great thing 
in the gospel for which I am most 
grateful is that it broadens and en- 
larges the scope of our vision, that 
it enables us to see more clearly the 
true relationship, not only of man 
to God, but of man to man. There 
are so many people in the world so 
engrossed with their own little un- 
dertakings, so devoted to the ac- 
complishment of the purposes that 
they set about to do, that they fail 
to grasp the great significance of all 
life, and they fail to understand and 
comprehend their true place in 
God's world. I have seen men en- 
gaged in the various professions 
who lived and breathed and slept 
their professions to such an extent 
that nothing without the pale of 
their work received any attention or 
any consideration from them. I 
have seen, as have you, men so en- 
tirely engrossed and absorbed in the 
pursuit after wealth or in the pur- 
suit after renown and praise and 
glory that come from men that 
<Jiey could not give, or would not 
give, any consideration, any atten- 
tion to things other than those 
which immediately concerned them- 
selves and the vocation or pursuit 
in which they were engaged. It is 
a great blessing to be able to stand 



up higher than the mere foot stool 
upon which these men stand, and 
to see life in its true aspect. It is a 
great thing to be able to see the rel- 
ative value, or the relative values, 
of the things which enter into and 
constitute our lives, our lives' work, 
and I regard it as a most unfortu- 
nate thing that many of the men 
most gifted with talent, men whose 
bfains have comprehended great de- 
signs and schemes, for the progress 
of civilization, and the race, should 
be so narrow and contracted in their 
views that they are not able to see 
the relationship of themselves and 
their work to the work of God, and 
to the ultimate destiny which he has 
in store for his people. That to me 
is one of the greatest blessings 
which comes to Latter-day Saints, 
for no matter how engrossed we 
may be in our life's work, no mat- 
ter how intensely interesting it may 
become to us, we still see above the 
petty things of life, with which 
we are so engaged from time to 
time, and we see the eternal pur- 
poses of God being worked out in 
all our workaday world, and it gives 
us hope and encouragement and 
faith and strength to go forth and 
to .devote and consecrate our lives, 
by doing whatever little duty we 
may, to God and the accomplish- 
ment of his purposes. 

There are those among us who 
maintain that the highest gratifica- 
tion that can come to them comes 
from their association with men and 
women in fraternities, in clubs, in 
social organization^ of one kind 
and another. I have heard men of 
my own profession say that the 
most intense joy that they ever had 
in their lives came from their as- 
sociation with the brethren of their 
own fraternity. I have heard men 
who have been engaged in college 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



141 



work, in universities and colleges of 
the land, say that no higher pleas- 
ure has ever come to them than the 
close associations and comradeship 
which they formed and maintained 
at their schools. Why you, my 
brethren of the priesthood, know 
that their associations and their 
comradeship dwarf into insignifi- 
cance compared to brotherhood in 
the priesthood of God. You know 
that the warm clasp of the hand 
given by one who holds the priest- 
hood to another, pledging, as it 
does, fidelity, loyalty, trust, confi- 
dence, is worth more, a thousand 
times, than all that so-called social 
pleasure and fraternity that may be 
outside the pale of the gospel, for 
with those true feelings of affection 
there is interwoven the Spirit of 
God which permeates the heart and 
opens up our mutual understand- 
ings and brings a closer confidence 
and a greater love than can come 
from any other source in this world. 
And so, my brethren and sisters, if 
there be any among you or among 
your friends who seek for true fra- 
ternalism, let them come into the 
quorums of the priesthood and the 
organizations of the Church, there 
to receive the true fraternity of God 
and the brotherhood of man. 

Every one seeks after happiness. 
It is said to be the goal of our life 
and our life's work. You who have 
labored in the service of the Lord 
know that no happiness can com- 
pare with the joy of service in 
God's work. You know that no 
real joy is comparable to that which 
comes from having done a helpful 
thing to a neighbor, and demon- 
strated your love for him, and so 
having kept the second great com- 
mandment. 

So that, as I view it in my hum- 
ble way, all of those things that are 



worth having in this life may be 
had within the pale of the gospel. 
So far as I know there is nothing 
worth striving for, there is nothing 
of truth, there is nothing of true 
beauty, of refinement, of culture, 
that may not be had within our own 
Church, within the principles and 
ordinances of the gospel itself. It 
completes the full circle of require- 
ments of a human life. It provides 
a never failing rule of action for 
life and life's conduct. Someone 
has said, "what is there about 
'Mormonism,' what one thing is 
there about it, which more than 
anything else demonstrates its 
truth?" And someone answered, 
"everything." And so my brethren 
and my sitsers, to my thinking those 
who have spoken to you in this 
great conference have in outline 
and in many instances in detail of- 
fered to you a plan of conduct for 
your lives that will insure your suc- 
cess while on earth and what is 
greater still, will bring to you sal- 
vation in the eternal kingdom of 
our Father in the life to come. 

I want to bear my humble testi- 
mony to you that I know we are 
engaged in the work of God and 
the work of truth. I would that 
the same testimony should come to 
all my brothers among mankind 
and to all my sisters. I wish I knew 
some way, as President Smith said, 
to so build a beautiful mansion that 
all the world would be attracted to 
it and would come to it and dwell 
within it and partake of the holy 
Spirit which is given so abundantly 
for the help of mankind, and in 
such merciful fashion to those even 
who do not obey the teachings of 
the Lord. I think our Father is 
abundantly merciful in the way that 
he has dealt with us, and in the 
way that he has dealt with the 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



world. I have no doubt his judg- 
ment will be brought to pass upon 
the wicked, but I have no doubt 
that he is filled with mercy and 
compassion for all of those who 
have within them a spark of repent- 
ance and a spark of love for him 
and his work. May the Lord help 
each one of us to so live that we 
ourselves may be exemplars of the 
truth, that our lives may be shining 
monuments of the great truths which 
have been given to us and which we 
profess, and that we may show our- 
selves worthy of the great blessings 
of the gospel which have been given 
to us in such multiplicity for our 
well being, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Prof. J. J. McClellan gave the 
organ solos: "O My Father," and 
"Nearer, my God to thee." 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

We live in perilous tim.es when it 
behooves all to contribute to the in- 
creased production of foodstuffs — 
Prizes offered by the 'Church for the 
best yield of potatoes and wheat, to 
encourage increased production — 
What we can do for our country in 
its present crisis — The question at 
issue, the old one; the life of lib- 
erty, on the one hand, and its death 
on the other — The law of liberty 
one of love and common consent — 
Our Church constitution on the 
subject — Length of the war — Our 
duty to practice strict economy. 

These gatherings of the Latter- 
day Saints are among the most 
wonderful, T think, of any gather- 
ings of people in the world. I do 
not know where you will find an- 
other such gathering as this, and 
one which will produce such benefi- 
cient results as these gatherings of 
Latter-day Saints do. 



We have been told, during this 
conference, of many of our duties 
and obligations to the Church and 
also to our Country. The Latter- 
day Saint who performs his full 
•duty to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints will always 
perform his full duty to his Coun- 
try. A man cannot be a good Lat- 
ter-day Saint and not be a good 
citizen. 

We are living in perilous times. 
Our country is in a state of war. 
It is true we are in the chambers 
of the mountains and comparatively 
secure, but we each, nevertheless, 
have a duty to perform. President 
Smith stated in his opening remarks 
that in view of the condition that 
our country is in at the present time, 
it is the duty of every person, every 
farmer, every brother or sister, who 
can do so in any way, to help to 
contribute to the increased produc- 
tion of foodstuffs, and all should 
do everything they can in that di- 
rection. Our country may need all 
the aid we can give in this way be- 
fore we get through, and everyone 
can do something toward the pro- 
motion and increase of the food 
supplies of the. state and nation. 

It was decided at the priesthood 
meeting last night that certain 
prizes should be offered to encour- 
age the ward Priesthood quorums, 
high priests, seventies, elders, 
priests, teachers or deacons, — in 
each ward, and the Relief Societies, 
Young Men's and Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement organizations, 
Sunday School and Primary and 
Religion Class organizations in 
every ward in the Church, to start 
work at once. That, as soon as you 
go to your homes you should call 
your societies or quorums together 
and see if it is not possible for each 
of these organizations and quorums 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY.

to grow at least an acre of potatoes. 
The Church, through its Trustee- 
in-Trust, offers certain prizes for 
the best yield from an acre of po- 
tatoes and the best yield from five 
acres of spring wheat. This will 
give our boys and girls an oppor- 
tunity to do a little practical farm- 
ing. Good choice land should be se- 
cured, even if it has to be rented by 
the association, and the education of 
a practical nature that the boys 
and girls will acquire will alone be 
worth the effort. Here is the res- 
olution or memorandum that was 
voted upon at the priesthood meet- 
ing last night : 

"With a view of stimulating the pro- 
duction of foodstuffs which may be 
badly needed in these war times, the 
Trustee-in-Trust offers to any ward 
quorum of the priesthood, or any 
ward Relief Society, Young Men's or 
Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement 
Association, Sunday School, Primary 
Association ,or Religion Class, for the 
best yield from one acre of potatoes, 
$1,000; for the second best, $500; third 
best, $250; and for the best yield from 
five acres of spring wheat, $1,000; for 
second best, $500; third best, $250. 
Those organizations which desire to 
contest for the above named prizes 
will notify the Presiding Bishopric 
on or before May 15, 1917." 

We will arrange with bishops of 
wards and presidents of stakes to 
collect the necessary information 
and send to us concerning the plant- 
ing and growth and yield of these 
products. And the necessary in- 
formation will be duly publishel in 
our Church papers. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
here is something that we can do 
for our country. As the English 
say, "I can ,do my bit." You can do 
your part, and everyone ought to 
feel in his or her heart that there is 
something we can do and should do, 



for the time is momentous. The is- 
sues, as Brother Ivins stated to us 
yesterday, are the greatest that were 
ever thrust upon any people in this 
world. It is liberty on one hand, 
or the death of liberty on the other. 
To my mind this contention has 
seemed to be the contention of 
the ages. The fight that has 
been going on for the last three 
hundred years or more which has 
won for us our precious heritage of 
liberty, now lies in the balance. I 
do not need to try to state the great 
issue to you because the President 
of the United States has stated it so 
fully, so forcefully, so pla'nly, that 
a wayfaring man, though a fool, 
need not err therein. It is made 
clear even for such as he. But it 
has seemed to me that all through 
this great world conflict, the same 
influence and spirit has been fight- 
ing for supremacy and rule as it 
has fought down through all the 
ages. We read of the contention 
that existed in heaven before this 
world was organized, and in that 
great conflict, we are told that one- 
third of the hosts of heaven were 
overpowered and thrown out. But 
the spirit of that contention did not 
cease to exist. It has existed and 
has come down to us through the 
ages ; one side contending for in- 
dividual liberty and the rights of 
man, and the other side contending 
for rule by force and by compulsion. 
That was essentially the issue in 
that great conflict before the world 
was. Christ stood for government 
by persuasion, by long suffering, by 
kindness and gentleness and love 
unfeigned. The other power was 
for government and salvation for 
all, to be secured by the spirit of 
force and compulsion, wherein all 
would be saved without agency, or 
what we call common consent. That 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spirit of the evil one has never been 
suppressed up to the present hour. 
In this present world conflict that 
same issue is at stake. One side is 
contending for liberty, freedom, 
government by the consent of those 
who are governed, what we in this 
Church call common consent; the 
other side is the old contention for 
the divine right of kings who claim 
they can give to the people better 
and more efficient government 
through compelling them to do 
what the rulers believe to be right. 
And in that way Lucifer proposed 
in the beginning to save all peo- 
ple by force and compulsion. 

The spirit that was making for 
liberty was in Henry the Eighth 
when he broke with the Pope of 
Rome and fought against the power 
that was being exercised upon the 
bodies and souls of the children of 
men, which was in the last degree 
tyrannical, and was destructive of 
human liberty and human rights. 
It was the old fight reappearing in 
a new form, but with the same spir- 
itual influences opposed to each 
other as in the beginning. Those 
same spiritual forces were at work 
in the contest with Oliver Crom- 
well, on one side, and the Stuart 
kings on the other. Cromwell was 
fighting under the spirit of Christ 
for greater liberty. The Stuarts 
were fighting under the old Lucifer 
spirit for the suppression of liberty 
and for government by force. 
Those same influences were in the 
fight with George Washington and 
the continental army on the side for 
greater liberty, and Great Britain 
on the other side against the exten- 
sion of liberty and the plain rights 
of humanity. Those same influ- 
ences were at work in the fight of 
Abraham Lincoln and the northern 
states, contending for liberty and 



the rights of man, freedom from 
slavery, with the South represented 
by the coercive spirit which Lucifer 
always prompts and which is 
against liberty and in favor of co- 
ercion and compulsion. Therefore, 
the issues in this great world war 
are most momentous. All of our 
liberties that have been won by so 
many years of turmoil and strife, 
all the aggregation of the ages of 
that which makes for the rights of 
the individual and blessings to hu- 
manity, are at stake and lie in the 
balance today. Every Latter-day 
Saint knows which side of the great 
conflict he should be on. For there 
is nothing in this Church, nothing 
in its organization, but what makes 
for liberty and righteousness and 
must be done by common consent. 
These are the words of our Church 
constitution : "No power or influ- 
ence can, or ought to be maintained 
by virtue of the Priesthood only 
by persuasion, by long suffering, by 
gentleness, and meekness, and by 
love unfeigned." And when any 
man tries to exert authority or ex- 
ercise compulsion, or force, or se- 
cure dominion over the souls of the 
children of men, in any degree of 
unrighteousness, then the spirit of 
the Lord is grieved and it will soon 
be withdrawn from such a man. 
That is the spirit of liberty which 
this Church is governed by, where- 
in is the agency of man, that he is 
left a free agent unto himself to 
choose the good and reject the evil. 
Now then, my brothers and sis- 
ters, we can do our part. We can 
at least do something in this great 
conflict on the right side. Let us 
take the counsel of our President, 
and at least try to produce food 
more in abundance than we have 
ever done before. That is the word 
of the Lord to you and to me. And, 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 



145 



to stimulate that effort, there has 
been offered by the Trustee-in- 
Trust the prizes that I have men- 
tioned. I am sure that our sisters 
can economize and help in these 
matters. They can knit stockings 
and underclothing. I am sure that 
all of us brethren can be less ex- 
travagant. It is a time for econ- 
omy. The most rigid economy may 
be forced upon us by the govern- 
ment itself, even in the food we eat, 
and in the clothes we wear. It 
may yet come to that. I hope not, 
but it has come to that in the older 
countries : in England, in Germany, 
and in other countries, it is already 
in force among the people. In the 
meantime, we can economize more 
than we have done. We can do 
without some of the things jwe 
think we ought to have, until next 
fall, in any event, and let us see 
then how the wind blows ; see what 
turn things shall have taken by 
then. We will know a little more 
about it, six months from now, 
and yet it is quite within the range 
of possibilities that this war that we 
are in may last more than a year ; 
although, of course, we all hope it 
will be over in a few months. 

I remember when in New York, 
two years ago last September, after 
the war had started, I was enquir- 
ing of different prominent leading 
men whom I met, as to the prob- 
able length of time that the war 
would last. I remember one of the 
ablest of these men, who stands at 
the head of one of the very largest 
business affairs in the United 
States, said to me that he did not 
see how it was possible for the 
war to last longer than about three 
months. Well, it has lasted now 
two years and seven months, and 
may last another year or longer. 
One thing we do know and can rest 



assured of, that the purposes of 
God will not fail. *In the very be- 
ginning, his purpose was to give 
liberty to all his children. That 
purpose will not fail. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
let me counsel you to use economy 
in all ways. Save everything that 
will sustain life. Save your bread- 
stuffs, wheat, potatoes, and all food 
products. Save the potato peelings 
for the chickens and the pigs. Let 
us economize and save wherever we 
can. Let us try to make ourselves 
feel poor for six months, and we 
will all be benefited through it and 
by it. God bless you. Amen.

car, entitled, "My Redeemer." 



ELDER HYRUM W. VALENTINE 

('Late President of the Swiss-German 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters: I ap- 
preciate very greatly the privilege 
that has been accorded me to make 
some little report concerning the 
work and the conditions in the 
Swiss-German mission. I would 
not forget to thank you, my breth- 
ern and sisters, and I rejoice that 
I have this splendid opportunity of 
thanking you for the sympathy, for 
the love, for the interest that was 
felt for the Saints in that mission, 
in 1914, and more particularly in 
April, 1915, when we received from 
your bounteous hands the sum of 
ten thousand francs to be distrib- 
uted among the poor and oppressed 
of that land who were engaged in 
that mighty conflict. That sum was 
afterwards repeated, once again in 
full, and once again by half ; and 
that was more than anything per- 
haps that might have been done by 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Saints at home for those Saints 
abroad in that land who had been de- 
prived of their shepherds, and it did 
our hearts good. We felt that you 
were with us, that you were sustain- 
ing and supporting us. I doubt not 
that a repetition of that very kind 
act would be thankfully received by 
our brethren and sisters who are lo- 
cated in that war stricken country 
today. I speak now of Europe in 
general, and not any part of our 
mission. 

One of the last priesthood meet- 
ings that we were permitted to hold 
with the elders of our mission was 
held on August 29, 1914. And I 
think upon that occasion the Spirit 
of the Lord directed us most mar- 
velously and we were filled with the 
spirit of testimony, concerning the 
subject of obedience. I don't be- 
lieve that the spirit of obedience 
ever rested so mightily upon our 
elders or upon our priesthood meet- 
ing as it did upon that occasion. 

We returned to our headquarters 
at Basel, after the priesthood meet- 
ing was over, and Sunday morning, 
August 30, 1914, before we were 
out of bed, we received a tele- 
gram from President Hyrum M. 
Smith, then presiding over the 
European mission, to release every 
elder who was in the Swiss-German 
mission and take steps at once to 
have them reach Liverpool by Sept. 
16 and 30. The tears rolled down 
my cheeks, my brethren and sis- 
, ters, and I said to my wife: "I 
don't see how we can do it, how are 
we going to get along ?" I thought 
a moment and I said : "Oh, yester- 
day when we enjoyed the Spirit of 
the Lord in such abundance, and the 
spirit of obedience was so impressed 
upon our souls, little did we think 
that before the sun should rise we 
would be called upon to exercise 



that obedience;" and I said: "We 
will do it." 

Well, I think almost every trial 
that comes to us in life, almost 
every commandment that comes to 
us, the sense of doubt that beats 
within our own bosom will vanish 
like this difficulty vanished before 
our eyes, the very moment that we 
make up our minds we will do it. I 
. went to the bank on Monday morn- 
ing, I told the cashier of the bank 
what had happened. It was neces- 
sary for us to have about twenty- 
five thousand marks. We had no 
available money. We had some re- 
sources but they were tied up, and I 
said: "Will you be willing to pry 
that money loose and give it to us 
that we may comply with this re- 
quest?" He sent me up to the di- 
rectors. I had a most beautiful op- 
portunity to bear my testimony and 
to talk to those directors and tell 
them what had occurred, and they 
said: "Why certainly, certainly. 
It is unusual, but we will be glad to 
do it." They gave me the money 
and we started on our journey. I 
never made a more successful jour- 
ney through the mission in my life. 
Within the time of twelve days we 
visited every conference and or- 
ganized almost every branch 
throughout the mission, returned to 
our home in Basel in safety, and 
provided every elder with sufficient 
money to pay his bills and carry him 
to Liverpool. More than this, we 
returned to our homes feeling that 
the Lord had spoken, and that the 
word of the Lord was being carried 
out in that work. 

On September 27, the first Sun- 
day after all our elders had left that 
mission, we went to the branch of 
St. Gallen, in Switzerland, in order 
to complete the organization that 
had been effected there. Our branch

in Basel was placed in the hands of 
Brother Spoerri. Many of you 
may know him. He was not the 
most qualified man, according to the 
eyes of men, for that responsible 
position, but we felt certain, 
through the inspiration of the Lord, 
that he was the man for the place. 
Upon our return on Tuesday, from 
St. Gallen, our good Sister Closios, 
who is known to some of you — and 
a more faithful Latter-day Saint it 
would be hard to find — met us at the 
door, and I said : "How did you 
get along Sunday?" She threw up 
both her hands and said : "Why the 
Lord blessed and magnified that 
man, Brother Spoerri, in our eyes, 
and we had such a rich outpouring 
of the Spirit of the Lord that we 
all knew of a surety that the word 
of the Lord had been given to us, 
and that we were not going back- 
wards but forwards." This is my 
testimony to you, not only in the 
branch of Basel but throughout the 
entire mission. 

We have about sixty branches in 
the Swiss-German mission. We 
have about seven thousand souls 
belonging to that mission, and not 
one branch amoiig those sixty 
branches has been closed by rea- 
son of the elders having been taken 
out of that mission. The work has 
gone on most beautifully. In 1915, 
we had the banner year in the his- 
tory of that mission on the subject 
of tithing. We had one of the ban- 
ner years in the history of that mis- 
sion, in the matter of fast offering, 
and we had the banner year in that 
mission in the sum total of the char- 
ity that the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was able to 
distribute among the people of that 
mission. In 1916, the year that has 
just closed, — and the figures and 
the remarks that are made are based 



on the nine months' .experience that 
we had, the reports for the last three 
months not being in our posses- 
sion — we baptized over three hun- 
dred souls in that mission. There 
was paid, according to the best esti- 
mation that I am able to furnish, 
twenty-two thousand dollars in tith- 
ing, one hundred ten thousand 
francs. Now that is an enormous 
sum of money for those seven thou- 
sand Saints to pay, and a more hon- 
est tithing was never paid in all the 
history of the mission. Why, there 
were five hundred of our men- from 
that mission who were taken into 
the war immediately, and of that 
five hundred we had lost thirty- 
four up until the time I left. Not- 
withstanding the fact that these 
men were taken, who were in the 
.prime of life and were the most vig- 
orous, the most stalwart men that 
we had in the Church, we surpassed 
all previous records in our finances ; 
we gave out over two hundred thou- 
sand tracts and pamphlets, in the 
year 1915, and I am satisfied that 
in 1916 we will have given out three 
hundred thousand. 

The work of the Lord is progres- 
sing; it is the Lord's work. The 
people are sympathetic with us, and 
I regret at times to find here a 
spirit of antagonism toward our 
people over there. Let me tell you 
how I feel. I feel there is a con- 
flict between these two govern- 
ments, but I do not feel that there is 
a conflict between the people, not 
between the people but between the 
governments. We have had sor- 
rowing times. 

I want to say a word about 
Brother Kessler, one of your citi- 
zens of this city. He was sent over 
there to edit the mission paper. A 
more faithful man was never sent 
to us to perform missionary work, 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and he found himself in a most dif- 
ficult position. On August 1, 1914, 
President Hyrum M. Smith and I 
were out in the mission traveling 
through Germany. The war came 
like a thunderbolt. We never had 
a word of warning of it at all. 
Brother Kessler said: "I carry in 
my pocket a sworn statement, an 
oath that I will be ready at the 
moment they call for my help." He 
said : "I could not look my country- 
men in the face and stand here 
when they call for me to render as- 
sistance." He said, "It is true I 
have been sent here to do mission- 
ary work, and I have enjoyed my 
work most exceedingly, but I can't 
edit the paper any longer, there is 
nothing here but turmoil. We will 
not be able to cross the boundary; 
I can't cross the boundary; if I do, 
I will be taken as a deserter and 
cast into prison and possibly shot. 
I don't know but that tomorrow the 
French will rush over the boundary 
here into Basel; they will discover 
that I am a German citizen, and I 
will be taken a prisoner of war and 
interned. I don't know but tomor- 
row the Germans themselves will 
cross over the boundary here and 
come riding in a street car. They 
could come in a street car and ride 
into the city of Basel, and they 
could come here and take me as a 
traitor to my country. I may be 
cast into prison, I may be executed. 
It matters not," he said, "but I feel 
I must go!" In the anguish of his 
soul, he went to serve his country, 
and there is no criticism. Oh, I 
know the anguish of his soul, many 
days after he had gone into the war, 
how he felt what a burden he had 
taken upon himself. He might have 
waited. I have often said he might 
have waited eight days and Pres- 
ident Smith would have been there 



and he might have counseled with 
him. I don't think the result would 
have been any different, but he 
would not have had the burden 
resting on his shoulders. I want to 
say to you, he was just as true a 
servant and a soldier in his coun- 
try's army as he was a servant of 
God in our midst. We know of his 
example from the letters we re- 
ceived from the officers in the army, 
in the regiment, in the division 
where he served, and he is a credit 
to our people. My brethren and 
sisters, he died as he lived, — a faith- 
ful Latter-day Saint, a soldier of th; 
Cross, though enlisted for the time 
being with his country's army. 

Another beautiful illustration of 
the fruits of the gospel is found 
in the man who today is writing for 
our mission paper. I regret that 
our mission paper does not come 
through. Many of our people at 
home have felt that the mission 
paper was not being published. It 
is not true. The paper is being pub- 
lished, but it has been unable to 
pass the censor since about the first 
of September, 1916. Brother Hof- 
mann is a man who, before he came 
into the Church, was a Social Dem- 
ocrat who did not believe in any- 
thing. Brother William Wright of 
Ogden was delivering a lecture, one 
night, and this man was passing the 
door. He heard him and stepped 
in. He was susceptible to the teach- 
ings of the gospel, he joined the 
Church. He is a very fine architect 
and a supervisor of buildings. He 
was almost ready to pack his trunk 
and his grip and come to America, 
come to Zion, that he might serve 
the Lord more faithfully. We felt 
impressed to call him on a mission 
in March, 1914. We called him on 
a mission and he gave up his plans 
gladly and went out into the mis- 



ELDER H. W. VALENTINE. 



149 



sion field. On August 7, it became 
necessary for him to join his regi- 
ment. He said : "Oh ! as they 
buckled on to me that tourn : ster 
and gave me that shining gun in 
my hands, do you know what my 
prayer was?" He said : "I prayed 
to the Lord every night in secret 
that it might not be my lot to shoot 
one of my fellow men. I did not 
want to shoot anybody; and oh, 
how I rejoiced when, after seven 
■days in the army, I was assigned to 
the hospital corps, and I was re- 
lieved of the responsibility of shed- 
ding the blood of any of my breth- 
ren." He said : "I saw an answer 
to my prayer there ; and when I was 
in that Good Samaritan work, my 
fellow comrade and I, binding the 
wounds of a fallen comrade, a gre- 
nade fell in between us and tore 
from him his arm and from me a 
leg. I thanked God," he said, "to- 
day, that I escaped from that ter- 
rible war with the loss of a foot and 
a leg." 

Do you know how pur hearts bled 
when we saw that big man, after 
having been released from the hos- 
pital, returning to us to enter into 
the missionary work, he came with 
an artificial limb, a poorly equipped 
artificial limb, and two heavy canes, 
bearing about two hundred pounds' 
weight largely on his hands. The 
tears rolled down our cheeks, and 
I wept. Oh, I wept; and then I 
saw what many a father and many 
a mother and many a wife and child 
has had to pass through in this 
cruel war. But he laughed and 
said : "I am thankful to the Lord 
that I escaped with the loss of a 
foot and a leg." He is doing valiant 
service, and has done now for near- 
ly two years, as the editor of our 
mission paper. I have thought to- 



day, as often before, what would 
we do there today, were it not for 
this man? He is almost our only 
support there ; because now that we 
have gotten into turmoil and war 
the animosity and the hatred that 
grow up with war will make itself 
manifest there. 

I want to admonish you, my 
brethren and sisters; let us deal 
kindly with our fellow men. We 
are not responsible that we were 
born in this country of freedom and 
liberty. Our fathers before us 
fought the fight and bled and oh, 
how their hearts were torn and their 
paths marked by the blood of their 
feet while they struggled for the 
freedom that we enjoy. I feel that 
such is the struggle that is going 
on in Europe today. I feel that the 
struggle over there is a struggle for 
freedom and for liberty of human 
rights and human thoughts. Of 
these great United States our 
Father in heaven has said : "This 
is a choice land, choice above all 
other lands, reserved for my own 
purposes." I wonder what his pur- 
poses were? Here the gospel of 
Jesus Christ was cradled, and it 
could not have been restored else- 
where. It has gone out from here 
to all the nations of the earth, and 
the messages of freedom and lib- 
erty have gone out from here. I .do 
not feel to be sorry that this war 
has come as it has. I just hope that 
these United States will not fall 
from that lofty place where our 
Father in heaven has placed them — 
the guardians of human rights and 
human liberty and freedom in every 
land, in every clime. If we stand 
for that, no harm can come to any 
nation by reason of our having en- 
tered into this war, when the foe 
has fallen, as fall he must ! . I want 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to tell you there will be a time when 
this country needs the assistance of 
every patriotic citizen, to see that 
we do not make usury out of the 
situation that has been placed in our 
hands. Those people feel kindly to- 
ward us, and I feel kindly toward 
them. I have found out, through 
my little experience in life, that 
when I have not loved a brother, or 
a sister, it has always been because 
I did not understand them ; and 
coming to understand them, I have 
learned to love them. 

Now let me illustrate exactly 
what I mean. On my first mission, 
seventeen years ago, I labored with 
a number of men, all of different 
characters. We had our differences, 
but I learned to love those men, and 
I love them today just as much as 
I love my own brothers. In my last 
missionary experience, I had the 
privilege of laboring with three 
hundred fifty-six elders. They were 
not all alike; indeed, they were all 
different, and yet I loved those 
three hundred fifty-six men, and I 
am delighted, every Opportunity I 
have, to see them, to shake their 
hands, and to speak to them. 

I have .enjoyed the hospitality of 
those seven thousand Saints in that 
land. I have eaten their food, and 
so have your boys and your fathers 
— when they had none themselves. 
I have slept in their beds, when they 
sat down in chairs, and the Lord 
has blessed them, and I love them 
for that charity, because I have 
learned to know them. I think we 
can do a great work here. There 
is going to be trouble, no doubt of 
it, and there will be misunderstand- 
ings. A man is likely to say some- 
thing in defense of his country, 
and saying something in defense of 
his country, in times of war, is 



likely to bring some trouble ; but 
let us be full of compassion. Let 
us be full of love, let us be full of 
the spirit of the gospel, that we 
may lead those who are in our 
midst, who have been placed in this 
trying position, and not antagonize 
them, because I want to tell you 
their hearts are right. They are 
here because they love the gospel ; 
they love this country ; and the fact 
that they cannot divorce themselves 
entirely from the country that gave 
them birth and livelihood is to' their 
credit and not to their shame. 

The Lord bless us and help us to 
be faithful and true and to take this 
spirit of frugality, that has been so 
emphasized in this conference, into 
every nook and every clime. 

When we were returning home, 
coal was selling in Paris for two 
hundred francs a ton, forty .dollars 
a ton for coal in Paris. You who 
have been in Europe know what 
that means — forty dollars a ton, and 
they could not get it. Why ? Why 
there was coal piled up on the wharf 
at Havre, hundreds and thousands 
of ship loads, but it was not reach-, 
ing the people because they did not 
have the rolling stock to move it to 
them. Haven't ye got mountains 
and mountains of coal in this great 
state? And how many of us have 
not been on the verge of freezing 
because they could not get the coal 
to us? 

As I have traveled to and fro, in 
the little time that I have been at 
home, I have seen the cattle stand- 
ing huddled up beffnd a cedar post, 
growing smaller every day, and at 
the same time consuming a good 
real of feed. Wouldn't it be a good 
deal better for us to take care of 
these we have, instead of reaching 
out and trying to get a lot more, 



ELDER H. W. VALENTINE.

that might stand around and freeze 
to death and turn out to be only 
hides ! Frugality is what we want. 
"Why, we have got the money to 
pay for it," says one, but what good 
will it do that we have the money 
to pay for it if we can't get what we 
want? The same with potatoes, the 
same with wheat, the same with 
trimmings of the orchards, and the 
same with these waste places that 
have been spoken of that we should 
cultivate, not only for the crop that 
we get, not so much for the prize, 
but what a valuable lesson to our 
boys and girls and to our men and 
women, if we can instil in their 
hearts the spirit of thrift and fru- 
gality, and curb this spirit of ex- 
travagance and extrem : ty ; because, 
some day, as sure as the Lord lives, 
we will be brought to acocunt. If I 
can interpret the spirit of the gos- 
pel, it is- one great round of fru- 
gality. The law of God is the law 
of nature. Who ever saw nature 
wasting anything? Who ever saw 
the elements wasting anything? 
Why, they conserve everything. 
The law of nature is the law of 
God, and the gospel of Jesus Christ 
is the law of God to man, and it is 
frugab'ty from beginning to end. 
Let us remember it and husband our 
resources. » 

The Lord bless you all, my breth- 
ren and sisters. I am talking too 
•long, but I appreciate the oppor- 
tunity of giving you this little re- 
port, and bearing my testimony to 
you with respect to the integrity of 
the people who comprise the Saints 
of the Swiss-German mission. Let 
us be charitable with them, and 
with those who are in our midst 
who are placed in a most trying 
situation by reason of the war that 
has been projected. The Lord bless 
you in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



AUDITOR'S REPORT. 

Elder George Albert Smith 
read the following report of the 
auditing committee : 

Salt Lake City, April 6th, 1917. 
Presidents Joseph F. Smith, An- 
thon H. Lund, Charles W. Pen- 
rose, First Presidency of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

Dear Brethren: We, the under- 
signed members of the Auditing 
Committee of the Church, beg leave 
to report, that we have made an 
examination of the books and ac- 
counts of the Trustee-in-Trust as 
well as those of the Presiding 
Bishopric, for the year 1916, and, 
incidentally, also of the various or- 
ganizations of the Church, in rela- 
tion to their financial affairs. We 
have found everything in a very 
satisfactory condition. The meth- 
od of accounting is intelligently and 
skilfully done. 

It is gratifying to the committee 
to say that the disbursements of the 
funds of the Church have been 
made along beneficent lines and for 
the general good of the whole body 
of the Church. We desire to make 
special -mention of the very useful 
work done by the Latter-day Saints 
Hospital, and the Dee Hospital of 
Ogden, and the Deseret Gymna- 
sium, and it is pleasing also to note 
the erection of the new Church ■ 
Office building. It reflects the ad- 
vancement of the Church. The ap- 
propriations made for the support 
of the poor, and for the cause of 
education, and for the erection and 
enlargement of stake houses and 
meeting houses, both at home and 
abroad, is a matter of gratification. 
In a word, we have found every- 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thing satisfactory, and we so cer- 
tify. 

You will observe that this report 
is signed by only three members out 
of a committee of five. It has been 
a cause of regret to us that, through 
the demise of Joseph S. Wells, we 
lost the assistance of a very valu- 
able and intelligent man. Judge H. 
H. Rolapp has been absent from the 
city during our audit, and we lost 
the benefit ' of his intelligent ser- 
vices. 

Hoping that God may continue 
to bless you and give you strength 
and wisdom for the great responsi- 
bility resting upon you, we sub- 
scribe ourselves, 

Your brethren in the gospel, 
(Signed) W. W. Riter,

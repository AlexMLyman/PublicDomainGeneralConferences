vened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake 
City, at 10 a. m. on Sunday, April 
4th, 1909, President Joseph F. Smith 
presiding. 

AUTHORITIES PRESENT. 

There were present of the First 
Presidency, Joseph F. Smith, John

tles, Francis M. Lyman, John Hen- 
ry Smith, Heber J. Grant, Rudger

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and an- 
nounced that it had been decided to 
open the adjoining Assembly Hall 
for overflow meetings of the Con- 
ference, to accommodate many who 
cannot be admitted to the Taber- 
nacle. He recommended mothers 
to take their small children to the 
day nursery, that has been comfort- 
ably prepared for them, in the Lion 
House. 

The services were commenced by 
the choir singing the hymn : 

All hail the glorious day, 

By Prophets long foretold, 
When with harmonious lay, 
The sheep of Israel's fold 
On Zion's hill His praise proclaim, 
And shout hosanna to His name. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Patriarch Joseph E. Taylor. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

Though deep'ning trials throng your way, 
Press on, press on, ye Saints of God! 

Ere long the resurrection day 
Will spread its life and light abroad.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Man's insignificant individuality com- 
pared with God' great work. — Nothing 
to lose, everything to gain by faithful- 
ness. — True Saints can not be- led by 
false shepherds. — Friends of righteous- 
ness are not enemies of Zion.— -"What- 
soever the Lord requireth of me, that 
will I do." — Christ's Church will stand, 
and its power increase henceforth. — 
Integrity of early members of the 
Church a worthy exany>le to the Saints 
now. 

It is with feelings of gratitude 
to the Lord that I stand before you 
this morning, at the opening of 
our 79th Annual General Confer- 
ence. I thank the Lord for all 
His mercies and loving kindness to- 
ward all His people and, for that 
matter, for His continued mercy 
and kindness unto all men. I am 
very grateful that we have th( 
privilege of meeting togethei 
this morning under so favor- 
able circumstances, possessing as 
we seem to do, many if not all of 
the blessings of life, health and 
strength, peace, and the desire in 
our hearts to honor the Lord by 
our presence, manifesting our faith 
by gathering here on this occasion. 
This is a witness of our devotion 
to the cause of Zion. My 
heart is full of gratitude to the 
Lord, and of love for the Latter- 
day Saints, and for the Church of 
Jesus Christ throughout all the 
world. 

To me there is nothing in life 
that can compare with the great 
work that the Lord is doing in the 
midst of the children of men, in 
these latter days. While it may be 
said, and it is in a measure true, 
that we are but a handful in com- 
parison to our fellow men in the 
world, yet we may be compared 
with the leaven of which the Savior 



spoke, that will eventually leaven 
the whole world. We have ample 
assurance of the fulfillment of this 
thought in the growth and develop- 
ment of the cause from its in- 
cipiency until the present, for it has 
steadily and increasingly progressed 
and developed in the earth, from a 
mere half dozen of men 79 years 
ago, until today the members of 
the Church may be numbered by 
hundreds of thousands We have 
passed through the stages o: 
infancy and of irresponsible 
childhood, and are indeed ap- 
proaching the condition of man- 
hood and womanhood in our exper- 
ience in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and in all the conditions incident to, 
and that are connected with, the 
growth of the Church and the peo- 
ple of God, thus far in the cause of 
Zion, and also the necessity the 
people of God are under to uphold 
and sustain principles of righteous- 
ness and of truth against all pre- 
judices of the world, as well as 
against their own prejudices, and 
individual likes, dislikes and pre- 
ferences. We are learning the great 
truth that man is insignificant in 
his individuality in comparison 
with the mighty cause which in- 
volves the salvation of the children 
of men, living and dead, and 
those who will yet live in the earth. 
Men must set aside their own pre- 
judices, their own personal desires, 
wishes and preferences, and pay 
deference to the great cause of 
truth that is spreading abroad in 
the world. 

To my mind there is nothing in 
all the world so great and so glor- 
ious as the work that the Lord 
Almighty is doing in these latter 
days. I feel grateful that I have 
been permitted as an individual to 
take part, in a humble way, in help- 
ing ^0 promote th'e interests of 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Zion, and to spread its cause abroad 
in the world, from the days of my 
youth until now. I sincerely hope 
and pray that I may be able to en- 
dure faithful throughout the re- 
maining portion of my life. I have 
lived too long to think of faltering 
in the least now. I have put my 
hand to the plow and it is too late 
to turn or to look back; and, for 
that matter, there has never ap- 
peared to me to be any reason at 
all why I should look back, or why 
1 should slacken my efforts or my 
earnest desire to spread the cause 
of truth and help to build up Zion. 
Everything has pointed to the great 
good that has been and will be ac- 
complished. Everything has pointed 
to the justness and righteousness 
of the cause and made my duty 
clear to me, assuring me of ad- 
vancement and growth in knowl- 
edge and understanding by pursu- 
ing the cause that I have been pur- 
suing,- and that I still intend to 
pursue, by the help of God to the 
end. I see nothing to lose 
by following this course but I 
think I can see that everything is 
to be gained by it. I am determin- 
ed, therefore, to go on and con- 
tinue as faithful as I can be to my 
duty, to the trusts that are imposed 
in me. As far as it lies in my 
power, I want to be faithful to the 
work of the Lord, that at last I 
may be able to give an account of 
my life and stewardship that will 
at least be acceptable to the Great 
Judge of the quick and the dead. 

As it has been said many times in 
the past, "I am for the kingdom 
of God, or nothing." Zion, first 
and foremost. Seek first the king- 
dom of God and His righteousness, 
that all other thing's may be added 
in the due time of the Lord, and in 
accordance with His pleasure. 
These are principles that should 



prevade the minds and hearts of all 
the Latter-day Saints. We should 
have gained sufficient experience by 
this time to realize that no man, no 
individual, no clique, and no se- 
cret organization can combine with 
force and power sufficient to over- 
turn, the purposes of the Almighty, 
or to change the course of His 
work. Many and many an in- 
dividual has arisen in times past, 
and these individuals have been 
falsely impressed with the idea that 
they were going to work a wonder- 
ful reformation in the Church ; 
they anticipated that in a very 
short time the whole people would 
desert their standard, the stand- 
ard of truth to which they had 
gathered and around which they 
had rallied from the beginning of 
the Church until then. These per- 
sons thought the people would fol- 
low the "new shepherds," but the 
people of God Know the voice of 
the true shepherd, and the strang- 
er's voice they will not heed, nor 
the counsels of him who assumes 
authority that does not belong to 
him. None such will they ever 
follow. The Latter-day Saints 
know the spirit of the Gospel ; they 
understand the spirit of truth. They 
have learned their duty, and they 
will stand by the truth, no matter 
what may come. From the begin- 
ning until now, we have had to 
face the entire world; and the 
whole world, comparatively, is or 
has been arrayed against the work 
of the Lord, not all on account of 
hatred, not solely with the intent 
or desire in their hearts to do evil 
or to fight the truth, but because 
thev were ignorant of the truth, 
and because they knew not what 
thev were doing. Manv are de- 
ceived by the voice of false shep- 
herds, and are misled by false in- 
fluences. They are deceived ; they

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



know not the truth; they under- 
stand not what they do and, there- 
fore, they are arrayed, as it were, 
against the truth, against the work 
of the Lord; so it has been from 
the beginning. From the day that 
the Prophet Joseph Smith first de- 
clared his vision until now, the 
enemy of all righteousness, the 
enemy of truth, of virtue, of hon- 
or, uprightness, and purity of life; 
the enemy to the only true God, 
the enemy to direct revelation from 
God and to the inspirations that 
come from the heavens to man, has 
been arrayed against this work. 
You have never found the friend' 
to righteousness, the friend to rev- 
elation, the friend to God, the 
friend to truth, the friend to right- 
eous living and purity of life, or he 
who is devoted to righteousness and 
is broad enough to comprehend 
truth from error and light from 
darkness — I say you have never 
found such as these arrayed against 
the cause of Zion. To be arrayed 
against the cause of Zion is to be 
arrayed against God, against revel- 
ation from God, against that spirit 
that leads men into all truth that 
cometh from the source of light 
and intelligence, against that prin- 
ciple that brings men together and 
causes them to forsake their sins, 
to seek righteousness, to love God 
with all their hearts, mind and 
strength, and to love their neigh- 
bors as themselves. 

The soirit of the Gospel leads 
men to righteousness : to love their 
fellow men and to labor for their 
salvation and exaltation ; it in- 
spires them to. do sjood and not 
evil, to avoid even the appearance 
of sin, much more to avoid sin 
itself. This is indeed the spirit of 
the Gospel, which is the spirit of 
this latter-dav work, and also the 
spirit that possesses those who have 



embraced it; and the aim and pur- 
pose of this work is the salvation, 
the exaltation, and the eternal hap- 
piness of man both in this life and 
in the life to come. Will any man, 
or any set of men who really love 
righteousness, love God, love purity 
of life, and who are seeking for 
the truth, I ask, will such men ar- 
ray themselves against the work 
whose very object is that which 
they themselves seek? Those who 
fight against Zion, or against the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, are fighting! against 
God, against His truth, againsl 
light and knowledge, and revela- 
tion from the heavens to man, 
which we know man has received 
of God in the day in which we live. 
What shall we do? Our plain duty 
— so plain that none should misun- 
derstand it, none can misunderstand 
it unless they allow their prejudices 
and human weaknesses to prevail 
over their better judgment; our 
plain duty is to live in the spirit 
of forgiveness, in the spirit of hum- 
ility before the Lord, in the love of 
the truth more than the love of 
ourselves and our personal in- 
terests. 

The Lord told the young man 
who loved the world, that if he de- 
sired to be perfect, he should sell 
all that he had and give it to the 
poor, then said the Lord, "Come 
and follow me." This may be a 
very simple manner of expression, 
but there is a great deal of truth in 
it, there is an essential principle 
involved in it. It is the putting of 
that which is sacred and divine, that 
which is of God, that which makes 
for the peace and happiness of the 
souls of men, before our riches, 
before all our earthly honors and 
possessions. The Lord Almighty 
requires this of the Latter-day 
Saints ; and every man and woman

who has embraced the Gospel 
ought to feel in his and in her heart 
today, and in their souls always, 
that "whatsoever the Lord re- 
quireth of me, that will I do," or 
that will I give, no matter what it 
is. To a certain extent we have 
reached'that point, to the extent at 
least that we can forego the plea- 
sures of home, the opportunity of 
making means, of devoting our 
time to labors and industries that 
will bring great profit to us. We 
are willing to leave these things, 
and for years consecrate our time 
and our efforts to the preaching of 
the Gospel to the nations of the 
earth, and remain proclaiming the 
Gospel in the world until it shall be 
said to us "it is enough," and we 
receive an honorable release to re- 
turn to our homes. This is, of 
course, a step in the right direction. 
Many of us can do this, and many 
are doing it from time to time. Oc- 
casionaly we come across an in- 
dividual who thinks he could not 
do it. He thinks he could not sac- 
rifice his home interests, and the 
profits of his business, which need 
his personal attention. He thinks 
he could not leave these interests 
to go out into the world to preach 
the Gospel, and he asks to be ex- 
cused from being called to such 
labor as this. I fear that in such 
cases, if he were called upon to 
make a sacrifice of a portion of that 
which he possessed, of a worldly 
character, for the building up of 
Zion, or for the spread of truth, or 
for the defense of the people of 
God, that he would be found want- 
ine in his willingness to comply 
with such requirements also. For 
my own part, T would like to so 
live that with open heart and mind, 
before God and all men, if I were 
required to go to the ends of the 



earth and remain there proclaim- 
ing the Gospel of Christ, that I 
would be willing to do it; or if 1 
were asked to give up what I pos- 
sess in the world, for the building 
up of Zion, for some special neces- 
sary purpose, for advancing the 
cause of Zion in the world, that I 
would be prepared and ready to 
say, Father, here is all that I have ; 
1 place it upon the altar freely and 
give it for the benefit of Thy king- 
dom upon the earth and for the 
advancement of Thy cause. I would 
like to live so that this would in- 
deed be my determination and 
that I would be able, if the require- 
ment were made, to carry it out not 
only without regret but with plea- 
sure. But this I earnestly desire — 
I want to live so that, no matter 
what any other man in the world 
may do or say, so far as I am 
concerned there is but this one 
thing for me to do, and that is to 
be true to the covenants I have 
made with God and my brethren, 
to stand firm and steadfast for the 
advancement of Zion and for the 
building up of the kingdom of God 
in the earth. I want to so live 
that I can have in me the spirit and 
determination to forgive my broth- 
er his trespasses, as I would de- 
sire him to forgive my trespasses 
against him. We should all live so 
that the spirit of reconciliation, the 
spirit of peace, the spirit of love 
and of union may rise above the 
passions and feelings of anger and 
resentment that may be aroused 
in the hearts of men, in conse- 
quence of circumstances which 
mieht arise from time to time. Our 
lives should be such that these 
worldlv thinp-s may sink into insig- 
nificance, and that the love of God 
in the hearts of brethren might 
rise above all other things, no mat-

ter what condition or circumstance 
may be brought to bear upon us to 
provoke or wound our feelings. 

There is no salvation but in the 
way God has pointed out. There 
is no hope of everlasting life but 
through obedience to the law that 
has been affixed by the Father of 
Life, "with whom there is no vari- 
ableness, neither shadow of turn- 
ing;" and there is no other way by 
which we may obtain that light 
and exaltation. These matters are 
beyond peradventure, beyond all 
doubt in my mind; I know them 
to be true. Therefore, I bear my 
testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Lord God Omni" 
potent reigneth, that He lives and 
that His Son lives, even He who 
died for the sins of the world, and 
that He rose from the dead; that 
He sits upon the right hand of the 
Father ; that all power is given un- 
to Him ; that we are directed to call 
upon God in the name of Jesus 
Christ. We are told that we should 
remember Him in our homes, keep 
His holy name fresh in our minds, 
and revere Him in our hearts; we 
should call upon him from time to 
time, from day to day, and in fact, 
every moment of our lives we 
should live so that the desires of 
our hearts will be a prayer unto 
God for righteousness, for truth 
and for the salvation of the human 
family. Let us guard ourselves 
so that there may not come into 
our souls a single drop of bitter- 
ness, by which our whole being 
might be corroded and poisoned 
with anger, with hatred, envy or 
malice, or any sort of evil. We 
should be free from all these evil 
things, that we may be filled with 
the love of God, the love of truth 
the love of our fellow men, that 
we may seek to do good unto all 
men all the days of our lives, and 



above all things be true to our 
covenants in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

I know that this is Christ's 
Church. I know that the principles 
we have received are true, as far 
as I have been able to comprehend 
them. I need not 1 enter into a 
lengthy talk or discourse in relation 
to these principles, for you are 
familiar with them; but I do know 
that every principle of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ that has been re- 
vealed through Joseph Smith, the 
prophet, in these last days is of God 
and is true, and will stand for 
ever — that is, on its merit, as to its 
truth; it can never be overthrown. 
I know this with all my being. God 
has made me doubly assured by the 
presence and influence of His 
Spirit, and by the inspiration 
awakened in my soul to love that 
which is good, and to desire to for- 
sake that which is evil. I know, 
too, that the Lord Almighty will 
accomplish His purposes; no mat- 
ter about me, no matter what in- 
dividuals may do or scores of in- 
dividuals, for that matter or 
hundreds of them, or perchance 
thousands of them that may turn 
away from the truth, or who may 
fall by the way, stumbling over 
their own weaknesses as a result of 
the little strifes and bitternesses 
that arise in their hearts, one 
against another. Hundreds or 
thousands may fall by the way, but 
the kingdom of God will never fall. 
The work of the Lord will never 
stop, nor cease, for God has de- 
creed that it shall continue to pro- 
gress in the earth until His pur- 
poses are accomplished. This be- 
ing true, no power beneath the 
Celestial Kingdom can hinder its 
progress. Tt can't be done, for God 
has decreed it. I see in the pro- 
gress of this latter-day work, from 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

its inception, that mighty, irresis- 
tible power, that wonderful Divine 
providence that makes for right- 
eousness and for truth and for the 
advancement of the cause of Zion; 
working in and under and all around 
this Church, until it has brought it 
to where it is. That same power 
will become stronger and stronger 
and will work with greater rapidity 
and greater impetus in the future 
than it has done in the past, in pro- 
portion to the growth and develop- 
ment of the faith, knowledge and 
fidelity of the people of God in the 
earth. The kingdom of God and 
the work of the Lord will spread 
more and more; it will progress 
more rapidly in the world in the 
future than it has done in the past. 
The Lord has said it, and the Spirit 
beareth record; and I bear my tes- 
timony to this, for I do know that 
it is true. 

We believe in righteousness. We 
believe in all truth, no matter to 
what subject it may refer. No sect 
or religious denomination in the 
world possesses a single principle 
of truth that we do not accept or 
that we will reject. We are will- 
ing to receive all truth, from what- 
ever source it may come; for truth 
will stand, truth will endure. No 
man's faith, no man's religion, no 
religious organization in all the 
world can ever rise above the 
truth. The truth must be at the 
foundation of religion, or it is in 
vain and it will fail of its purpose. 
I say that the truth is at the founda- 
tion, at the bottom and top of — and 
it entirely permeates this great 
work of the Lord that was es- 
tablished through the instrumen- 
tality of Joseph Smith, the prophet. 
God is with it; it is His work, not 
that of man ; and it will succeed no 
matter what the opposition may be. 
We look now at the opposition ar- 



rayed against the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 
smile, so to speak, with feelings of 
confidence doubly assured by th< 
experience of the past, in compar- 
ison to the feelings that possessed 
the souls of our fathers and moth- 
ers in the early days of the Church, 
when they were but a handful, with 
all the world arrayed against them ; 
just a few poor, homeless people, 
driven from their possessions, cast 
out from the communities in which 
they sought to establish themselves 
and build their homes. When I 
think of our people, thrust into the 
wilderness, wandering and seeking 
for a place where the soles of their 
feet might rest, and see, then, the 
world arrayed against them, and 
think of the little chance that ap- 
peared before them for success and 
the accomplishment of their pur- 
poses, I wonder that more of them 
did not tremble and falter than 
did; but some of them were true 
in the midst of it all, even unto 
death. If it had been necessary 
for them to have been martyred 
for the truth, willingly would they 
have given their lives, as they gave 
all else that they possessed in the 
world, for the knowledge they had 
of the divinity of the work in which 
they were engaged. Are we as 
faithful today? Are we as devout 
as our fathers were Oh, my God, 
help me to be as true as they were 
Help me to stand as they stood, 
upon the pedestal of eternal truth, 
that no power on earth, or in hell, 
may remove me from that founda- 
tion. This is my prayer to • the 
Lord for my own sake, and it is my 
prayer to Him for every Latter-day 
Saint throughout the length and 
breadth of the world. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May He continue to pros- 
per us, and help us to increase in

righteousness and faith, in union, 
and in love, one for another and 
for God our Father, and for our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to 
whom we owe the hope and prom- 
ise of redemption from death and 
from the power of endless banish- 
ment from the presence of God. 
This is my prayer for you, my 
brethren and sisters, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

A bass solo, "Fear God, Oh Is-

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Determination to be diligent in duties, 
notwithstanding advanced age. 

I am delighted, my brethren and 
sisters, to have one more opportun- 
ity of meeting with you in general 
conference. President Smith asked 
the question, "What shall we do?" 
Answering that for myself, what 
shall I do? I propose to serve 
the Lord with all my might, mind 
and strength while I shall be per- 
mitted to remain here upon the 
earth; this is my determination. 
Every day that I live I feel that 
I am under renewed obligations to 
my Heavenly Father for His con- 
tinued mercies and blessings to me. 
I often think there is no person, 
that I know of, who is under great- 
er obligations to the Lord than I 
am for the many blessings He has 
bestow-ed upon me during my entire 
life; and for extending my days 
until the present time. He has been 
so kind and merciful to me that 
I could not, for one moment, be 
so ungrateful as to fail to acknowl- 
edge the hand of the Lord. I ex- 
pect to occupy only a few moments, 



but I am glad to have this opportu- 
nity of expressing to you my de- 
termination to continue in this work, 
and especially to keep sacred and 
holy the covenants I have made up 
to the present time, and seek to 
discharge and fulfill every duty that 
devolves upon me, with greater 
faithfulness in the future than I 
have done in the past. This morn- 
ing, as I listened to the words of 
our President, my soul was filled 
with delist, and with a renewed 
determination to per.form my du- 
ties, just so far as I am able to 
do so. 

It may not be necessary for me 
to say to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this is the eighty-eighth 
year of my life. Do you not think 
that the Lord has been good to 
me? I certainly would be ungrate- 
ful did I not serve Him through 
the remainder of my days, with all 
my might, mind and strength. I 
expect to stand by my President, 
to be on hand to assist him, in my 
humble way, to the extent of my 
ability, and as the Lord will gbe 
me strength. 

While the choir was singing the 
hymn this "morning, this vcise at- 
tracted my attention : 

Lift up your hearts in praise to 
God; 

Let your rejoicings never cease; 
Though tribulations rage abroad, 
Christ says, "In rne ye shall have 
peace." 

May the Lord bless the people of 
Israel in all their abidings. God 
bless you all, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and may He help me to carry 
out the determination which I hwe 
expressed this morning, to the full- 
est extent, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

The Church and Kingdom of God to 
be universal. — Saints should be zeal- 
ous in God's work. — Encouraging 
progress in the missions. — Import- 
ance of Priesthood, and attendance 
at meetings. — Failure to pass Tem- 
perance and Sunday laws entails ex- 
tra care. — Splendid work of Better- 
ment Committee. — Gratifying re- 
sults in Church Schools. 

I have been very much interested 
this morning in listening to the 
strong testimonies borne by Presi- 
dent Smith and President Winder. 
I have also a testimony of the truth 
of this work. As far as lies in my 
power, it is my determination to 
keep the covenants I have made 
with the Lord and with my breth- 
ren, and try to carry out in my ev- 
ery day life that which I under- 
stand to be the will of the Lord. 
The Lord commenced this work, 
the Lord has sustained it, and the 
Lord will continue to uphold it un- 
til it fills its mission, until it shall 
become, as it is destined to be, the 
universal Church of Christ upon 
the earth, and merge into the uni- 
versal kingdom of God. 

The President asked himself and 
us the question, "Do we feel the 
same zeal and enthusiasm manifest- 
ed by our fathers, those whom the 
Lord used to establish this work?" 
I hope we do, though I find that 
there is more indifference and care- 
lessness among us as a people than 
there ought to be. It would be well 
for all Israel to reflect upon their 
conduct, examine the condition in 
which they find themselves, and 
learn whether they have the same 
love for the truth as they had when 
they first received the Gospel. It 
should be greater by this time, for 
they have seen that the Lord has 
extended His hand to protect them, 



they have seen His hand-dealings 
with the people; and they know 
that without His help and aid this 
work could not have progressed as 
it has done. Besides, since receiv- 
ing the Gospel the Saints have 
learned many things of which they 
were ignorant before. Light has 
been shed upon their path, and they 
have been able to see the way that 
leads to eternal life. Passages of 
scripture that were dark unto them 
before, have been made clear and 
plain through the Spirit of God. 
They have, indeed, reason to be 
thankful to God for what they have 
received, and they have reason to 
make the same declaration as Broth- 
er Winder, that they will try to 
show their gratitude in their lives, 
and be determined to live such lives 
as shall be in accord with the will 
of the Father. 

On next Tuesday it will be sev- 
enty-nine years since the Church 
was organized. How wonderful is 
the history of the Church ! It is of 
great interest, and I would encour- 
age our people to study it. It has 
been very remarkable, and on every 
page we see that the Lord has over- 
ruled for good what the enemies of 
the Church have devised for its 
overthrow. The President said that 
this work will prevail, that nothing 
can overthrow the truth. "Truth," 
it has been said, "though crushed 
to earth, will rise again." Another 
author says that truth is tough; it 
may be buffeted and kicked about 
all day like a football, but at night 
it will come out full and round, 
not having taken the least injury 
from the treatment it has received. 
The treatment of "Mormonism" 
proves it possesses the same qual- 
ities, for it has been buffeted, kicked 
and grossly misrepresented, yet it 
has passed through every ordeal un- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



scathed. We thank the Lord that 
He has revealed the truth unto us. 
And now, my brethren and sisters, 
the Lord having done so much for 
us shall we be indifferent and neg- 
ligent in regard to the duties that 
devolve upon us as His people? 
Shall we not feel that there is a 
great responsibility resting upon 
us ? We do not want to tear down 
the religion of others, we simply 
want to show unto the world What 
we have received. We believe in 
truth, and if others have truths, we 
believe in them ; and we claim them 
also. We want to enlighten our 
fellow-men in regard to our faith, 
for we know that it is of inestimable 
value. 

What is greater than the salva- 
tion of souls? To each and every 
one of us our souls are worth more 
than all the world. We cannot af- 
ford to let the things of the world 
draw our attention away from that 
which is of greater value. Every 
one of us should feel that he must 
do something for the upbuilding of 
the kingdom of God, whether it be 
at home or abroad. Our mission- 
aries who have gone out to preach 
the gospel amongst the nations 
show their love for their fellow- 
men. They go without expecting 
temporal reward. They go because 
they feel it is their duty to preach 
the gospel unto others and let them 
know what the Lord has done, and 
what is necessary for them to do to 
obtain salvation. The Lord has been 
with them. During the past year 
we have seen more baptisms into 
the Church than for many years be- 
fore. Our elders have been more 
energetic in reaching the people, 
and they have seen the fruits of 
their labors, and a great deal of 
prejudice has been allayed. As 
men become acquainted with us 



they see us in a different light. We 
hope the day will soon come when 
freedom, in regard to religion, will 
be given to the nations who are now 
under laws that prevent them from 
worshiping God according to the 
dictates of their conscience. We 
are grateful to learn that even in 
such countries the gospel is making 
great progress. 

Lately there has been an agitation 
in Norway to have the legislature 
there do something to hinder the 
Latter-day Saint elders from preach- 
ing the gospel to the people. They 
say that our elders are so zealous 
to spread their doctrines that some- 
thing must be done to stop it. Those 
who were agitating this question 
wrote to the different bishops and 
priests of the country, and wanted 
their opinions on the question of 
passing a law against "Mormon" 
propaganda. I am pleased to say 
that a couple of the bishops answer- 
ed that, while it would be a desir- 
able thing to stop the propaganda 
of the "Mormons," no other than 
spiritual weapons should be used ; 
and that they were not in favor of 
passing laws against the "Mor 
mons." But there were a great 
many who were in favor of doing 
this. I hope that the representatives 
of the Norwegian people will have 
independence enough to act in con- 
formity with the spirit of freedom. 
There are many good people in that 
land, many have emigrated from 
there and have made good citizens 
of our state. In Sweden, as in Nor- 
way, they have not entire religious 
liberty ; still, we have not been mo- 
lested very much. Some time ago 
two of our Elders were cast into 
prison, and fined, but they appealed 
their case. When it was found that 
the appeal was from the priests' 
court to the Bishops' Council in 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



Stockholm, they knew there would 
he no change in the decision, so they 
got the case into the civil courts, 
and it was appealed to the higher 
courts, but, while the fine was re- 
duced, the case went against them. 
One of our brethren brought it be- 
fore the king, who gave it as his 
decision that there was no cause of 
action. This, I hope, will give our 
brethren liberty to preacn what they 
know to be true, and give the peo- 
ple liberty to accept that which the 
spirit of truth indicates to them to 
he God's will and purpose. 

In Germany some of our breth- 
ren have been put in prison and 
banished, yet the work progresses 
there in a very satisfactory manner. 
In the Netherlands there is great 
progress ; in Switzerland, likewise, 
and our brethren are working into 
the French-speaking parts, and are 
succeeding there also. In the United 
States the Elders have been very 
busily employed scattering the 
Word and bringing souls unto 
Christ. On the islands of the sea it 
is the same ; and in Japan our breth- 
ren are seeing fruits of their labors ; 
converts have been made and the 
Sunday schools are well attended. 
The Book of Mormon will soon be 
published in the difficult language 
of that land, and we honor our 
brethren who are laboring there. 
Brother Alma O. Taylor has been 
there nearly eight years. He and 
the Elders with him are working 
hard to reach the hearts of the peo- 
ple, and they are performing a good 
work. In Greece we are also mak- 
ing progress and will soon have 
the Book of Mormon published in 
the Greek language, and thus that 
people can have access to the great 
truths that it contains. 

At home our brethren in the 
Priesthood, who are laboring among 



the people, have been energetic, 
and they rejoice that the new move- 
ment to have all the quorums of the 
priesthood meet on Monday eve- 
nings has so far proved a success. 
It is hoped that all holding the 
Priesthood will help to make those 
meetings interesting. Summer is 
coming, and out in the rural dis- 
tricts it may be doubtful whether 
they can keep them up or not, but 
"where there's a will there's a way," 
I believe if the people would be de- 
termined to meet on that evening 
they can do so and much good be 
obtained from the Priesthood meet- 
ings. 

We must remember what an im- 
portant thing it is to hold the Priest- 
hood of God. We must not get cold 
and indifferent and think, "Let 
others go ahead in spiritual work, 
we will mind our own business." 
Our own business is to support the 
kingdom of God and build it ..up. 
The Lord did not give us life and 
being here upon the earth just to 
accumulate worldly things. He 
gave it to us, as we sing in the 
hymn, "for a wise and glorious pur- 
pose," and that purpose is that we 
learn His will and do that which 
we know He has commanded, and 
try to make others know it also ; 
then this existence upon the earth 
will bring unto us eternal life — the 
great joy and privilege of returning 
to our heavenly Father. 

We want to be on our guard, not 
only for ourselves, but we must be 
on guard to protect others also and 
promote their salvation. Parents 
must look after their children. 
There are so many temptations, and 
we want, if we can, to put a shield 
between them and these tempta- 
tions. If we know a house where 
there is smallpox we would not let 
our children enter there; and the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



law also steps in to protect us from 
the spread of epidemics, by quar- 
antining infected places. For the 
good of ourselves and our children 
we ought to be on our guard. We 
should not go where there is moral 
infection, where the morals of our- 
selves and our children are exposed 
to corruption. We have tried, dur- 
ing the past winter, to have such 
legislation passed as might shield 
our youth from the temptations of 
intemperance. We want to get the 
liquor evil stopped, if possible. Our 
people should never be seen enter- 
ing saloons or places where liquors 
are sold. This has been the teach- 
ing for years. Now that we did not 
succeed in getting such a law to 
help us, we are more urgently re- 
quired to guard our children, our 
young people, that they shall not 
be exposed to temptations of that 
kind. 

We were also in hopes of getting 
a Sunday law passed, so that 
amusements on the Sunday evening 
might have been stopped, that the 
Sunday might have been what the 
Lord intended it to be — a day of 
rest and of worship. We did not 
get it, but let us fry to influence our 
children to keep the Sunday holy, 
and warn them against going to 
pleasure resorts and places of 
amusement on Sunday evenings. 
We should make our homes as 
pleasant and attractive as possible, 
so our children will feel that there 
is no better place than the home. 
We want them to go to the evening 
meetings. They are held early 
enough so that after meeting there 
is time to go home, or visit friends, 
and in social intercourse, in that 
which is upbuilding, spend the Sun- 
day evening. We do not believe 
in the Puritan doctrine that you 
cannot smile on the Sunday. We 



believe that serving the Lord gives 
joy, and that it does not take it 
away. We do not believe in the 
long-faced kind of religion, but we 
do believe that the Sunday should 
be used as the Lord has command- 
ed, namely, to go to His house to 
be built up and strengthened in our 
holy faith, to go to His table, renew 
our covenants in partaking of the 
sacrament, and make our resolves 
to serve God so firm and so strong 
that they will carry us through not 
only the Sunday but every day of 
the week. We want the Sunday 
used thus, and then we are not op- 
posed to our young people coming 
together and enjoying themselves 
in our homes; but we do object to 
their being in the street, especially 
after the curfew hour has been 
rung. They ought to be at home 
with their friends and parents, or at 
least their parents ought to know 
where they have gone. 

I want to say that the brethren 
who have been appointed by the dif- 
ferent stakes as a betterment com- 
mittee have done magnificent work 
on the streets, among our young 
people. Many boys and girls who 
were just starting out, and, per- 
haps, would have taken a wrong 
road, have been helped by these 
brethren, who have so unselfishly 
spent the evening hours, until late 
into the night, for the sole purpose 
of saving the youth. I say that all 
commendation is due unto them 
for their zeal and energy in this 
good work, and, like them, I hope 
that we all will feel an interest in 
this great work of stopping the 
flood of wickedness that is threat- 
ening to inundate the young. What 
a great work there is before us in 
this direction! 

The Church, during the past 
year, has done more for the church 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



13 



schools than ever before, and we re- 
joice in the good work that the 
Church schools are doing in our 
midst; they build up the character 
of our young people, make them 
understand how valuable the Gos- 
pel is, and make them love it. 
When they go out from the schools 
we hope the Gospel influence will 
go with them, so that they may be- 
come a power for good among their 
comrades. I am also glad to see 
that our Sunday schools, our Pri- 
maries and our Religion classes 
have increased their enrollment 
during the past year, showing that 
these institutions are growing in fa- 
vor with the people. Don't let us 
for a moment think that we have 
too many institutions, that we are 
doing too much in trying to draw 
the attention of our children to the 
saving principles of the Gospel, and 
to living a correct life. We are not 
doing too much in this regard. Our 
children, if they have the right op- 
portunity, will love these things. 
Many young people, when they left 
home to attend the Church schools, 
thought that religion as taught 
there would be a most tedious 
course, but they have borne testi- 
mony afterwards that it is a most 
delightful study, and that they love 
it. They feel that here is something 
that they want to know, something 
that builds up and strengthens, and 
does not interfere with their suc- 
cess in school. Some have thought 
that if they studied theology they 
would not be able to keep up in 
their other studies, but they have 
found, as a general thing, that the 
study of theology inspires them 
with more energy and more dili- 
gence in their other studies. 

I am pleased that the Church has 
been able to do as much as it has in 
this regard, but there is a limit to 



what can be done, even in this. I 
believe that the Church, at present, 
has gone as far as it can in sustain- 
ing schools with Church means, as 
the Church members are also sus- 
taining the State institutions of 
learning with their taxes. They 
feel, however, that the means so ex- 
pended is bringing good results, 
for the work done in the Church 
schools is of great value, and it will 
make young men and women better 
able to bear the great responsibil- 
ities that will rest upon their shoul- 
ders in years to come. 

I want to say in regard to relig- 
ion classes, which are a part of the 
Church school system, that they 
ought to be encouraged. We want 
our children taught the principles 
of the Gospel, we want to encour- 
age them in living correct lives, ac- 
cording to the precepts given by the 
Great Master, and teach them to 
follow His example. That is all the 
object we have in the religion 
classes. Where there are Church 
schools, we hope that the Church 
school teachers will be interested in 
the religion class work. We can- 
not commend too highly the Brig- 
ham Young University Faculty for 
what they have done in this direc- 
tion; and we hope that all our 
Church school teachers will feel it 
incumbent upon them to take part 
in teaching the religion classes, es- 
pecially the higher grades of the re- 
ligion classes. 

Now, brethren and sisters, my 
testimony to you is that this work 
will continue to grow; that the 
Lord will be with it, and that at last 
we will see it conquer. 

May the Lord bless the people, 
and bless His servants wherever 
they go, that they may find the good 
and the honest and be able to con- 
vert them to the truth; and may 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who receive the truth be able 
to be faithful, and help to build up 
the work. God bless you all. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "I 
waited for the Lord." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Angus M. Cannon. 

Conference was adjourned until 
2 p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a. m. Elder Orson F. 
Whitney presided, and Professor 
Charles J. Thomas conducted the 
singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Now let us rejoice in the day of 
salvation." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ne- 
phi Pratt. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah." 

ELDER 0ES0N F. WHITNEY. 

Significance of an Overflow Meeting. 
— The Growth of the Church. — No 
building large enough to accommo- 
date the Saints.— The Spirit of God 
in all their Assemblies. 

My dear brethren and sisters, it 
gives me great pleasure to meet 
with you this morning in general 
conference, and in this overflow 
meeting of the conference. There is 
something in an overflow meet- 
ing that suggests prosperity and 
increase, and it seems to me 
that the most appropriate hymns for 
such an occasion are those begin- 
ning, "Zion is growing," and "Give 
us Room that We May Dwell." 
There was a time in the history of 
the Church when its entire member- 
ship could have been accommodated 



in one little room, or we might al- 
most say, upon one of these 
benches; for when the Church was 
organized,on the 6th of April, 1830, 
six humble men composed the mem- 
bership, that is, six men participat- 
ed in the act of organization. One 
of these was the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

It is true that there were others 
who believed in the principles of 
Mormonism, which Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery had been 
preaching — (the doctrines found 
upon the golden plates of the Book 
of Mormon, the principles of faith 
in God, repentance from sin, bap- 
tism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins, and the laying on of 
hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, some of which doctrines 
were entirely new to that genera- 
tion. While there were many who 
believed in faith and repentance, the 
world had lost sight of the fact that 
baptism was for the remission of 
sins, and thjey had changed the 
mode instituted by the Savior and 
His apostles. They were practic- 
ing different kinds of baptism. In- 
stead of immersing the whole body 
in water, as we do, some practiced 
baptism by sprinkling or pouring 
water upon the head, and none be- 
lieved that baotism was anything 
more than "the outward sign of 
an inward grace." It was not re- 
garded as necessary to salvation, 
and as having been instituted for 
the remission of sins. But the Book 
of Mormon, like the Bible, declar- 
ed this to be its purpose.and Jos- 
eph and Oliver, while translating 
the plates, when they came upon 
this doctrine, which was new to 
them also, marveled over it, and 
they went into the woods and pray- 
ed, asking the Lord for light upon 
the subject. It was then that Tohn 
the Baptist, as an angel from 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



15 



heavjen.descended and laid his hands 
upon their heads, ordaining them to 
the Aaronic Priesthood,which holds 
the keys of the ministering' of 
angels. This ordination empowered 
them to preach faith and repent- 
ance and to baptize by immersion 
for the remission of sins. 

But this was as far as that au- 
thority extended. It did not empow- 
er them to bestow the Holy Ghost. 
They had to receive a higher ordin- 
ation — to the priesthood of Mel- 
chisedek, before they could lay 
hands upon those baptized, and con- 
fer upon them the Holy Ghost. 
When they had received this higher 
priesthood,as they did some months 
later under the hands of Peter, 
James and John, they were au- 
thorized not only to baptize their 
converts, but to confirm them by 
the laying on of hands and the be- 
stowal of the Holy Ghost. It was 
under the authority of the Aaronic 
and the M)elcriisedek priesthoods 
that this Church was organized. At 
the time of the initial meeting, 
thirty-six persons, men and women, 
were all that believed in the doc- 
trines that Joseph Smith had pro- 
claimed. This was the number of 
the original congregation, and six 
of these organized the Church. The 
reason there were six was because 
the laws of the State of New York 
required no less than six persons to 
form a religious society; and 
doubtless it would have been in- 
convenient to have chosen any more 
to performi the initial act. 

At that time the converts to 
Mormonism, so called, could all 
have been gathered, and as a mat- 
ter of fact, were gathered, in one 
small ro|om of a humble farm 
house in the little village of Fay- 
ette, Seneca County, New York. 
The membership of the Church 
could all have been seated on one of 



these forms, or in one of these 
stands. But how is it at the present 
time? Why, "Zion is Growing." 
Her children have called, and are 
still calling aloud, "Give us room 
that we may dwell." Today, in 
all the world, there are between 
300,000 and 400,000 Latter-day 
Saints. Ten thousand of them are 
assembled in yonder Tabernacle at 
this moment, and still there is not 
sufficient room, and hundreds are 
gathered here in this overflow 
meeting who could not be accom- 
modated in the Tabernacle. 

Never will all the Latter-day 
Saints be able to congregate at one 
time' in the same building. King 
Benjamin built a tower, it is writ- 
ten, that he might speak to all his 
people, and they came 'and pitched 
their tents around about the tow- 
er that they might hear his instruc- 
tions. They held a great open-air 
meeting, because they had no build- 
ing large enough for the purpose. 
It would have to be so today, if 
the -President of the Church should 
attempt to address all the Latter- 
day Saints. They could 'scarcely 
be got together within a compass 
that would render it possible for 
him to make himself 'heard and un- 
derstood by all. This is a good 
sign. I rejoice in the fact that the 
members of the Church cannot all 
get into the Tabernacle, nor into 
any other building. It is a sign of 
increase, of .prosperity. It is a sign 
of zeal, of interest and enthusiasm 
in the work of the Lord,wEen over- 
flow meetings must be^held in order 
to accommodate His people. 

I rejoice in being with you today. 
There isl no reason why we should 
not have the Spirit of God in this 
meeting, the same as in any meet- 
ing where, true, honest, sincere 
pure-hearter! Latter-day Saints as- 
semble. The Lord says that where 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



even two or three are met together 
in (His name, there He will be in 
the midst of them. We claim this 
blessing. We have a right to the 
Spirit, just as if we were in yonder 
Tabernacle ; and the Lord is ready, 
according to our willingness to re- 
ceive, to bestow that blessing upon 
us, and to cause our hearts to re- 
joice, with the rest of the Saints, 
in this His glorious work. We are 
here to be fed — to be built up and 
strengthened spiritually; the Holy 
Spirit is here, and whoever rises in 
this stand and desires to voice the 
word of the Lord, shall have it, and 
the Lord will speak through him 
to the edification and enlightment 
of the people. May God bless us 
in the purpose for which we have 
assembled ; v and I feel to bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALUS. 

(President of Southern States 
Mission). 

The remarkable growth of the 
Church is a splendid tribute to its 
leaders. We testify that our lead- 
ers are prophets, seers and reve- 
lators. The members of the church 
are entitled to be guided by the 
insoiration . of the Holy Ghost, if 
they live their religion. When men 
act under the influence of the Spirit 
of God they do not go astray in doc- 
trine, or in their daily walk and con- 
duct. I rejoice in the glorious truth 
that the work of the Lord is grow- 
ing. It is being strengthened in the 
stakes of Zion, and in the world, in 
the missions. It is growing daily. 
Hundreds are being added to the 
Church, and are receiving the same 
blessings and gifts that you, my 



brethren and sisters, received and 
enjoyed when you entered the 
Church of Jesus Christ. 

The work of the Lord, which the 
world designates as Mormonism, is 
constructive in its nature. It is man 
only that has drawn the line be- 
tween things temporal and things 
spiritual; all things belong unto 
God our Heavenly Father. Jesus 
said that God was not the God of 
the dead but of the living, for all 
live unto him. The Latter-day 
Saints are taught that in their tem- 
poral affairs they should serve the 
Lord, on the farm, in the mill, tn 
the mountains, and wherevei men 
are called to labor. By an exem- 
plary life they can proclaim the 
gospel ; their good works glorify 
their Father in heaven. 

Last year there were baptized in- 
to the Church, in the Southern 
States Mission, 842 souls. Many of 
the people in the beautiful south 
land are rejoicing in the work of 
God. School houses and churches 
are being thrown open to the elders, 
and people are calling for the mes- 
sengers of life and salvation. We 
cannot furnish elders enough so 
that all may hear the glad tidings 
of great joy. Thus, you see, there 
is a great work mapped out for the 
members of this Church to equip 
themselves for the important mis- 
sion to preach the gospel unto every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people. 

As I said, the gospel is construc- 
tive in its nature and teaching. In 
South Carolina, there dwells the 
remnant of a once powerful tribe of 
Indians, the Catawbas. But vice 
and wickedness which, unfortunate- 
ly too often follow in the wake 
of civilization, invaded d eir peace- 
ful abodes and, from a tribe of 
6,000 they have dwindled down to 
100 in number. Two-thirds of this 
remnant now belong to the Mormon

Church, and we have established 
a day-school and a night-school in 
which to teach them, both old and 
young. We have organized a pri- 
mary class, religion class, relief so- 
ciety, and Sunday school, in which 
those people and their children in 
whose veins flows the blood of Is- 
rael, may be taught more fully in 
the ways pertaining to life and sal- 
vation. 

I am reminded of a saying of 
Alma, which is recorded on page 
319 of the Book of Mormon. It 
seems to foreshadow, as it were, 
the scope of the glorious work of 
this dispensation. It seems to indi- 
cate to the Latter-day Saints that 
their work is not to be confined to 
one city, nor to one country. It is 
true that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
was a descendant of forefathers 
who fought in the Revolutionary 
war; that the founders of this 
Church were patriots and Ameri- 
cans; that the gospel was restored 
upon American soil, and that this re- 
stored gospel may be called an 
American religion. But it is also true 
that it is more than American, it is 
worldwide, because our message is 
to every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people. Alma says : 

"O that I were an angel and could 
have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the 
trump of God with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto 
every people; yea, I would declare un- 
to every soul as with the voice of 
thunder, repentance and the plan of 
redemption, that they should repent 
and come unto God that there might 
not be more sorrow upon all the face 
of the earth. But, behold, I am a man, 
and do sin in my wish: for I ought to 
be content with the things which the 
Lord hath allotted unto me. * * * 
Now, seeing that I know these things, 
why should I desire more than to per- 
form the work to which I have been 
called? Why should I desire that I 
was an angel, that I could speak unto 



all the ends of the earth? for, behold, 
the Lord doth grant unto all nations 
of their own nation and tongue to 
teach his word; yea, in wisdom, all 
that He seeth fit that they should 
have; therefore, we see that the Lord 
doth counsel in wisdom, according to 
that which is just and true." 

It is the destiny of this gospel to 
be preached on the islands of the 
sea, and this is being done toda) 
on many of them, by faithful ser- 
vants of Christ The Lord has de 
creed that of every nation there 
should be men who would preach 
the word of God in the nation's 
tongue, in language that their 
people could understand. We 
are living in the day of the fulfill- 
ment of prophecy, in an age when 
the glorious truths of the Book of 
Mormon are being confirmed and 
proven to be true. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith was only 25 years 
of age when the translation of this 
book was completed. How did he 
know that the gospel was to be 
preached unto every nation, in their 
own tongue? How did he know, 
except by the spirit of revelation, 
that you Latter-day Saints would 
raise up sons unto the Lord who 
would be instructed in foreign lan- 
guages and, leaving their mountain 
home, would go forth and preach 
the gospel in Germany, Russia, 
Scandinavia, England, Ireland, 
Scotland, Wales, and on the isles 
of the sea preaching in the tongue 
of the people to whom they are 
sent? This prophecy is being ful- 
filled. There are now in the South- 
ern States Mission more than a doz- 
en young men who were born in 
the sunny South, who, after they 
were baptized into the Church, came 
up to the "mountain of the house 
of the Lord " and after being more 
fully instructed in the words of the 
God of Jacob, they went back to the 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



land of their birth, where they were 
received with gladness and their la- 
bors have been effective. They have 
preached the gospel with ability, and 
in faith, with great success. I be- 
lieve that from Japan, Germany, 
Russia, and all countries on the face 
of the earth will come, forth men 
who, having obeyed the gospel, will 
preach the glad tidings of great 
joy unto the people of their respec- 
tive countries, and bring many souls 
unto a knowledge of the gospel. 
This is a reason why the Latter- 
day Saints have cause for rejoicing. 
We are living in the dispensation 
of the fullness of times. O how our 
hearts should rejoice to know that 
the divine mission of Joseph Smith 
is being proclaimed every day of 
our lives, and in almost every 
country on the earth. 

Now, have we something to do? 
Yes. I believe that the most pre- 
cious treasures God has given un- 
to us are our children. Without 
children life would be dreary, it 
would be deprived of one of its 
greatest pleasures and one of its 
greatest responsibilities. I believe 
that joy and responsibility are close- 
ly associated, they cannot be separ- 
ated. The man and woman who 
shirk responsibility, are heedless to 
the call of duty and humanity, are 
not living up to the high ideals 
God has placed before them. 

I was reading an incident, a short 
time ago, of a woman who had been 
shipwrecked, and in the storm her 
two little children were swept away 
and drowned, and she was rendered 
unconscious by being struck on the 
head by a piece of wood. She was 
taken to a hospital, and when she 
came to consciousness, in response 
to the queries of her friends, she 
sent this telegram : "I am saved, but 
saved alone." She was saved alone. 
How will parents feel if they are 



saved alone? If a man and his vviie 
are saved, and they have neglected 
to teach their children the principles 
of the gospel, how will they feel? 
Is it possible for a father and moth- 
er to enjoy the felicity of heaven 
when they realize that by their in- 
difference, and neglect of parental 
duty, their sons and daughters, un- 
taught in the principles of the gos- 
pel, and in some cases not baptized 
for the remission of sins, have taken 
a downward path? I repeat, can a 
lather or mother feel happy in heav- 
en if their children are not with 
them? 

I rejoice in the glorious associ- 
ations which the gospel brings to us. 
We hear people say sometimes that, 
if we love God we will be saved in 
the day of judgment. But, love is 
the fulfilling of the law. The truest 
evidence of loving our children is 
that we teach them the principles 
of the gospel, and bring them up in 
the fear of the Lord. The deepest 
anguish and sorrow comes when 
men and women see their children 
going astray. The saddest cry is that 
which is wrung from the hearts of 
many mothers in this fair country: 
"O where is my wandering boy to- 
night?" 

God is not going to be mocked. 
If He established the gospel for the 
salvation of men, as we testify, 
then it is the only thing that wili 
bring us unto eternal life. If a man 
fails to obey the principles of the 
gospel, how can he say that he 
loves God? Jesus said, "If ye love 
me, keep my commandments." What 
other church teaches the glorious 
doctrine that man is made in the 
personal image of God ? What oth- 
er church proclaims that faith, re- 
pentance, and baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins, and laying 
on of hands for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, are essential unto sal-

vation? Jesus said: "It is writ- 
ten, Man shall not live by bread 
alone, but by every word that pro- 
ceedeth out of the mouth of God." 
Man has no authority to cut off 
from the gospel the principle of bap- 
tism ; he cannot deny the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. He has not the right 
to say to his fellow creature you 
may obey one principle of the gospel 
and discard another. The Redeem- 
er said that we should live "by ev- 
ery word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God." This is the gos- 
pel that the Lord enjoins us to 
teach unto our children, and that we 
are taking unto the nations of the 
earth. 

The Lord inspired Luther, Cal- 
vin, Knox, and all other great re- 
formers, to teach the children of 
men that measure of truth which 
He designed they should have; but 
today the fullness of the gospel has 
been restored to the earth, and we 
are basking in its glorious sunlight. 
Some people say, "Is not the reli- 
gion of my father and mother good 
enough for me? They were good 
people, and if I can live to be as 
good as my father and mother, I am 
satisfied." But, in that, men and 
women deceive themselves. Our 
fathers and mothers lived up to the 
best light they had before the gos- 
pel was restored. They obeyed God 
to the best of their ability, when 
they lived up to the measure of 
truth He gave unto them. But the 
Lord in this day hath spoken unto 
the. people and commanded thalt 
they should obey the fullness of 
the everlasting gospel. This gos- 
pel means much more to you and 
me. It teaches the eternity of the 
marriage covenant ; that father, 
mother, and children shall be reunit- 
ed in heaven, if they live pure lives 
and work for the salvation of their 
fellow creatures. And so, I say it is 



essential to obey the gospel that has 
this glorious power. At the last 
day it will be well for us to be able 
to say that we belong to the Church 
of the Son of God, that has and ex- 
ercises the power of uniting hus- 
band and wife for time and all eter- 
nity, cementing family ties so that 
they will exist for ever. When I 
think of these glorious blessings, 
I say, Thank God for the gospel. 
I want to live up to its teachings, 
so as to gain the exaltation which 
it will surely bring unto the faith- 
ful. 

Brethren and sisters, let us not 
be discouraged. Despair cometh 
from beneath, but hope cometh from 
above. The Lord is our Father. 
He is carrying this work on to a 
glorious consummation. God grant 
that you and I may not fall by the 
wayside, but that when the end 
comes, when we pass to that sleep 
from which the Lord, in Plis own 
due time, will awaken us, God 
grant that we may all meet together, 
firm in the faith, rejoicing in the 
true gospel and the reward of the 
righteous; which is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

I sincerely trust, my brethren 
and sisters, that I may be blessed 
with your sustaining faith and 
prayers, to the end that the purpose 
of this meeting, as suggested by 
Elder Whitney in his remarks to 
us this morning, may be realized. 
I experience comfort in the prom- 
ise he made, that any one stand- 
ing in this pulpit, sincerely desiring 
to sneak the word of the Lord, 
should be blessed to that end. 

I have been edified and instruct- 
ed, with you, in the remarks that 
Elder Callis has just delivered to 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us. I feel proud of the disinter- 
ested service that such men as El- 
der Callis is performing. Wins- 
ton Churchill, the rising- man in 
England, said some months ago to 
a congregation assembled: "We 
who are gathered here this after- 
noon know well, that no empire 
and no nation can long endure in 
power and fame in this world unless 
it labors not only for its own social 
interests, but is a faithful servant of 
high forces and works for the good 
of the whole human family." That, 
too, is the mission of Mormonism ; 
and in the work that these elders 
are performing, they labor not 
alone for the welfare of the people, 
but their services are high forces 
and works for the good of the 
whole human race. One has but to 
visit one of our gatherings where 
nationalities are represented in cos- 
tume and the like, as they some- 
times are, to realize how cosmopol- 
itan this people is. One has but to 
pick up one of our journals giving 
an account of our Sunday schools 
organized from Alaska to South 
Africa, from Iceland to Samoa, to 
realize that this religion of ours is 
world-wide. I have been impressed 
of late with the far-reaching con- 
sequences and effects of the la- 
bors of our missionaries. An elder 
sometimes returns home and ex- 
presses himself that he does not 
know what gDod he was able to 
accomplish, that he sowed some 
good seeds, perhaps, but there were 
no particular evidences of fruitage 
from his sowing. Yet I am per- 
suaded that the efforts of these 
elders, no matter how humble those 
efforts may be. are by no means in 
vain. An elder may visit the 
tiome of an individual who will 
sourn him from his door, threaten 
him with the doe. or with his gun. 
The elder may leave feeling that 



no impression whatever has been 
made upon that individual, that his 
mission, so far as the visit to that 
home is concerned, was, wholly 
in vain. But not so. Other elders 
perhaps ten years later, may report 
that that same individual walked 
ten or fifteen miles to seek them, 
to explain the change that has 
come over him, and extend to them 
an invitation to go to his home 
and partake of his hospitality, say- 
ing th^t, during all those years 
since he had spurned the Mormon 
elders from his door, he had not 
had peace of conscience, and he 
desired an opportunity of cancell- 
ing, so far as generous acts to oth- 
ers of the same sect might, his 
unigenerous conduct towards thie 
other missionaries. The man who 
refuses to purchase a Book of 
Mormon from the elders, and on 
whom the elders may seem to have 
made no impression, may be the 
first to purchase the book when op- 
portunity is presented, years later, 
by other Mormon elders. I have 
sometimes thought, in connection 
with the labors of those who had 
faith sufficient to look out over their 
hand-cart and face the setting sun 
and an almost trackless desert a 
thousand miles in extent, that the 
labor and sufferings of those peo- 
ple were not in vain by anv means. 

While traveling through Color- 
ado, some months ago, a report was 
given by one of the missionaries 
that, in recounting something of 
the labors of these pioneers in- the 
hand-cart company, the expression 
of one rough cow boy was, after 
hearing the storv: "There must 
have been something to their d — d 
religion or they would not have 
undergone trials like that." T 
thought that there was a reward 
and a compensation to the parents 
who engaged in those expeditions

in the impress it has left upon 
their posterity. I have heard indi- 
viduals say, who were actively en- 
gaged- in the ministry, and had 
been many years endeavoring, as 
best they could, to accomplish good 
for their fellow men, that they felt 
that if they labored all their lives 
as diligently as they might, in the 
service of the Lord they would 
never be worthy of being the 
children of their fathers and mo- 
thers who had endured those hard- 
ships in connection with the hand- 
cart companies. So with the in- 
dividual who may make only a 
single convert, he may feel that 
it is spending much of his time to 
go abroad, leaving profitable em- 
ployment, his family and loved 
ones, and devoting years of his 
time abroad in the ministry, per- 
haps to realize that only a single 
individual has been. converted. But 
how far-reaching in its results up- 
on the Church and upon the world, 
for good, may be the single con- 
vert that he is able to make. Some 
one, perhaps, had similar thoughts 
in making the early converts to 
the Church, some of whom became 
great characters in Mormon his- 
tory, men like 1 President John Tay- 
lor, President P>irgiiam Young. 
President Wilford Woodruff and 
others of that type, who were able 
to leave such an impress for good 
upon Mormonism and upon the 
world. Perhaps , some missionary 
devoting months Or years of time 
in making such convert felt that 
his time was not very profitably 
occupied, yet subsequent results 
show how rich was the harvest and 
the fruitage of his labors. 

T have been impressed, of late, 
in reading the work of Dr. Paley 
on the Evidences of Christianity. 
How largely the arguments and 
reasonings that he presents in be- 



half of Christianity can be applied 
in support of the cause of Mor- 
monism. He lays down one prop- 
osition, to which he devotes in sup- 
port several hundred pages of his 
excellent treatise: "That there is 
satisfactory evidence that many 
persons professing to be original 
witnesses of the Christian mir- 
acles passed their lives in labors, 
dangers and sufferings voluntar- 
ily undergone in attestation of the 
account which they delivered, and 
solely on account of their belief 
in that account, and that they also 
submitted, from the same motives, 
to a change in the rules of their 
own conduct." He devotes, as I 
say, several hundred pages of his 
work in giving historical incidents 
and proofs in support of that prop- 
osition. The same may be said in 
reference to Mormonism, because 
Mormonism is, like Christianity, 
founded largely upon miracles ; and 
the individuals who testified of 
those miracles passed their lives 
in labors, dangers and sufferings, 
voluntarily undergone, in attesta- 
tion of the account which they 
gave of the divine origin of Mor- 
monism and the ushering in of this 
Latter-day dispensation. It had an 
effect upon their conduct in the 
abandoning of ideas and ways of 
the world that they had been in- 
doctrinated in up to that time, and 
in adopting new modes of con- 
duct in conformity with the teach- 
ings of the newly revealed religion. 
Dr. Paley also lays down a counter 
proposition to the one just stated, 
that "There is not satisfactory evi- 
dence that persons professing to 
be original witnesses of any other 
similar miracles have acted in the 
same manner in attestation of the 
accounts which they delivered and 
solely in consequence of their be- 
lief of the truth of those accounts. 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Mormonism, which is not taken in- 
to account by him, would have to 
be excluded from that exception 
here made, for, as I suggested be- 
fore, nearly all the arguments that 
he adduces in support of the prop- 
osition that I first stated, as being 
laid down by him, can be put forth 
in support of Mormonism. He en- 
ters into a consideration of so- 
called pagan miracles, or miracles 
othier than those in support of 
Christianity, and suggests that it 
is not necessary to accept 'the state- 
ments that can be accounted for on 
the ground of delusion or halucina- 
tion or a diseased condition of the 
mind; and he points out the fact 
that many so-called pagan miracles 
will not bear the test of a close 
scrutiny. Many of them, for in- 
stance, are accounts given in one 
country of something that happen- 
ed at some place far remote from 
where the account was written. In 
many instances it is the history 
of some anterior event, a century or 
more before the time. of the writing 
of the account. He says that, in 
most of these instances, it is upon 
the statement of only one indivi- 
dual, the hearing of a voice or the 
seeing of something by a single 
individual, and not by a group of 
individuals ; and further, that gen- 
erally there is an appeal to one 
sense only of the individual, as that 
of sight or hearing alone, and that 
the so-called vision scarcely ever 
consents or submits to being hand- 
led ; that the reality or verity of 
the vision is in no wise substan- 
tiated by the sense of touch as well 
as of sight. 

You may apply all of the rules 
and tests that he lays down for con- 
sidering and verifying the genuin- 
ness of miracles to the history we 
have of the coming forth and the 
institution of Mormonism, and you 



shall find that the evidences we 
have, in support of the divine or- 
gin of Mormonism, differ very 
largely and very widely from those 
so-called voices or visions that he 
speaks of as being recorded as com- 
ing from pagan lands, or given in 
support of incidents otherwise than 
in connection with the establish- 
ment and coming forth of Christi- 
anity. The fact that Joseph Smith 
received revelation in reference to 
there being golden plates is sup- 
ported by the presentation of those 
plates, and there are at least eleven 
besides himself who saw the plates. 
Three of the number testify not 
only to seeing the plates but to 
hearing the voice declare that the 
record had been translated by the 
gift and power of God, and that 
the work was therefore true. Here 
is the sense of sight, supported by 
the sense of hearing. The eight wit- 
nesses not only saw the plates but 
handled them. There was also mus- 
cular sense of weight verifying the 
sense of sight and touch. Then 
again, it was not brought to a sin- 
gle individual, but to a group of in- 
dividuals ; and Dr. Paley points out 
the improbability of the senses of 
several individuals being diseased 
and deranged in the same way at 
the same time. So I say .you can ap- 
ply all these tests in certification 
of the reality of these spiritual man- 
ifestations to Joseph Smith, and 
the early leaders of the Church, and 
you shall find that the evidences 
given to Joseph Smith bear the 
scrutiny and the application of 
those tests, and one cannot, in any 
psychological manner, explain away 
the attestation' of those truths to 
these men. It is equally futile to 
undertake to explain these miracles 
upon the ground that there was any 
fraud or collusion involved in them. 
If you reason that these things 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFF IN. 



23 



must be true because the sense of 
sight of twelve men would not be 
deluded in the same way, that their 
sense of hearing could not be de- 
luded in the same way, and that 
their sense of touch could not be 
imposed upon or deceived in the 
same' way, all at the same identical 
time, you reach the conclusion that 
either those individuals saw, and 
heard, and felt what they say they 
did, or that there was collusion 
among them. Then, if you ex- 
amine the account on the theory 
that there was collusion, your 
premises utterly fail, because there 
is not the slightest evidence of there 
being any connivance or collusion 
among these men to foist upon the 
world any false account. The very 
fact that some of the number de- 
parted from the fellowship of the 
Church, but never varied one iota 
in the account that they gave of 
these divine miracles with which 
A'formonism was instituted, sweeps 
away at one stroke the theory that 
there was possibly any connivance 
or collusion in connection with this 
account. I pray that the blessings 
of the Lord may be upon you all, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN. 

( Former President of Central States 
Mission). 

Last evening, with many of you 
who are here today, I listened to a 
very interesting account of a naval 
journey that was recently taken 
by a fleet of battle ships of the 
United States. One of the facts 
that impressed me very much, in 



the speaking of Admiral Evans, 
was his relating the obedience of the 
officers and seamen to the com- 
mander of that fleet. He said, when 
the word came to him from the 
President that he was to get the 
fleet in order, and start upon that 
long cruise, he felt that they would 
not only by request, or command, 
of the commander in chief of all 
the forces of the United States, go 
to any possession belonging to the 
United States, any waters, but that 
they wee on hand, at a moment's 
notice, to go to any part of the 
earth where their ships could float. 
I thought, while he was speaking, 
that was the spirit of a true sol- 
dier. I thought also in connection 
with that, how like to it are the true 
soldiers of the cross. When those 
holding the Holy Priesthood speak 
by the voice of the spirit of God, 
and say to the true soldier of the 
cross, Your services are needed in 
Africa, Russia, or Asia, or some 
part of this great land in which we 
live, or upon tne isles of the sea, 
there is no hesitancy, he says at 
once, as did Admiral Evans, "Aye, 
Aye, sir, we are ready, when will 
you have us start ?" And this great 
army of young men, belonging to 
the Church of Jesus Christ, take 
their lives in their hand, as it were, 
not considering consequences to 
themselves, or the sacrifice of their 
earthly possessions, they leave all, 
and go to any part of the earth 
where the authorized servants of 
God call them to travel. 

While Brother Whitney was 
speaking concerning the growth and 
development of this great work, how 
the people had heard the gospel 
sound in various nations of the 
earth, had gathered to these moun- 
tains, and had been organized into 
stakes and wards, I was thinking of 
the responsibility that is placed upon 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us who have thus been gathered 
and organized here ; and of the re- 
sponsibility that is upon all who 
have been born and raised under 
the sacred covenant of the gospel 
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus 
Christ. As was stated by Elder 
Whitney, I had the honor, for a 
number of years, to preside over 
one of the great missions that have 
been established by the Church of 
Jesus Christ for the proclaiming of 
the gospel. During that period of 
time, there were several hundreds 
of young men who labored under 
our direction, and I had the op- 
portunity of observing the results of 
home training, of the effect' the 
teaching and training of the father 
and mother had upon the lives of 
these young men. I take it that one 
of the most important duties we 
have to perform is that of rearing 
and teaching these precious souls 
that are entrusted to our charge, 
bringing them up in the wav of the 
Lord, that they may be fitted, while 
passing through this mortal proba- 
tion, for earnest, devoted and effici- 
ent work, to aid in the progress and 
development of the work of our 
Heavenly Father, that their souls 
might be saved eternally. In the 
Doctrine and Covenants, there is 
a revelation given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in the early rise of 
the Church, in which the Lord says : 

"Inasmuch as parents have children in 
Zion, or in any of her stakes that art 
organized, that teach them not repent- 
ance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and baptism by immersion for the remis- 
sion of sins, and the laying on of hands 
when eight years of age, the sin be upon 
the heads of the parents. And the par- 
ents shall teach the children to pray, and 
to walk uprightly before the Lord, and 
shall observe the Sabbath day to keep it 
holy." 

And there was an injunction 



placed upon the parents that they 
should be an example unto their 
children of what they would have 
them become. Now during the 
time I was presiding over that' mis- 
sion, as I have said, I had opportu- 
nity to study the effects ot home 
teaching and training upon the lives 
of your boys; and I have pleasure 
in saying to you here today that, 
during the years I was there, out 
of the hundreds of young men who 
labored in that mission, there was 
not one failure on the part of those 
who had been carefully taught and 
trained by parents at home. The 
failures were very few indeed ; those 
few young men who weakened and 
gave up, who came home without 
performing fully and completely the 
work they had been sent to perform, 
were, without exception, those 
whose training at home had been 
neglected by their fathers and moth- 
ers. The responsibility here at 
home is not only that the young men 
ma} become efficient missionaries, 
but that they may also be good 
workers in wards and stakes, in 
the various organizations established 
by our Heavenly Father, and, that 
they may be honored citizens of the 
great nation of which they form a 
part, so that when we, as parents, 
give an account to our Father and 
Mother in heaven of the manner 
in which we have conducted our- 
selves toward the precious souls en- 
trusted to us, how we have dealt 
with them, that we might bring 
them all with us, and be able to say 
to our Heavenly Father, Here are 
these sacred trusts that you gave 
unto me while I was upon the earth, 
I present them to You now spot- 
less, full of faith and integrity, fit- 
ted indeed to be members of Thy 
eternal kingdom. To do this re- 
quires thought, work, care, and 
faith, to bring these children up in

the way they should go. You know, 
it was the wise man Solomon who 
said : "Train up a child in the way 
he should go, and when he is old he 
will not depart from it." 

There is a difference between 
teaching and training. Teaching 
is causing the child to understand, 
training is causing the child to, : do. 
Every act performed is that much 
done towards fixing habits ; repeat- 
ed many times, the habit is estab- 
lished. If we train our children 
in the ways of the' Lord, in doing 
the things God has revealed for 
their salvation, every time they per- 
form an act of obedience to the 
word and will of our Father in 
heaven their character becomes 
more firmly fixed in doing the 
things that God requires of them. 
Another thought in connection with 
this. In my business I have the 
privilege of meeting people from 
different parts of the United States, 
and even from foreign countries, 
some of whom come here to make 
their homes among us. There are 
several significant things said in 
my hearing by people who travel 
among us. One expression is this : 
"You can always tell the home of a 
Mormon by his surroundings." An- 
other is: "You can tell the home of 
a Mormon by the size of his fam- 
ily." Now, what does this mean? 
Does it mean that our home sur- 
roundings are so beautiful, so neat, 
so orderly, so much in accord with 
the divine plan of growth and de- 
velopment, that when one of these 
strangers, driving through the coun- 
try in his travels among us. sees a 
home of this kind, he can say at 
once. That is the home of a Latter- 
day Saint? Or does he mean the 
opposite? What are the conditions 
surrounding our homes? Now, 
when he speaks of a Mormon fam- 
ily, saying "You can always tell 



whether it is a Mormon family or 
not, by the size of it," does he mean 
that alone? To us it should mean 
that in that family we are develop- 
ing faith, honesty, and integrity, 
that we are educating and training 
them, making them refined, genteel, 
courteous to the stranger. Does if 
mean that to us ? Now, my .breth- 
ren and sisters, I take it that in 
the divine plan of our Heavenly 
Father there is just such work for 
us to do in the family. The family 
is the foundation of the govern- 
ments of the world, and it is the 
foundation of the government of 
the kingdom of God. 

May we give thought, attention, 
and care to all things that 'will 
cause Zion to grow and increase 
in strength and power, beauty and 
glory, I ask, in the name of Jesus 
our Lord. Amen.

I have seen the day when I knew 
every man, woman and child in 
Salt Lake City. I was a year and 
a half old when I was brought into 
this valley. I had the rickets, so 
my mother said. I presume that 
meant I could not stand up, be- 
cause I was so weak. On that day 
we landed in a desert, so desolate 
and still that it must have been ap- 
palling to the few hundred Latter- 
day Saints who arrived here that 
year. On July twenty- fourth, 1847. 
the first company in advance of 
those that had been driven out of 
Illinois, by the rage and hatred of 
those who opposed truth, arrived 
in this valley; and President Brig- 
ham Young, wrapped in the visions

of eternity, when he saw this coun- 
try knew that it was the place pre- 
pared for the people of God. He 
put the point of his walking stick 
down in the dust, just over there, 
and said : "Here shall be erected the 
temple of our God, and around this 
spot shall be builded a great city." 
I remember many of the scenes 
through which we passed. We were 
little and weak, poor, desolate and 
destitute. With the growth of my 
body and intelligence, I saw mighty 
forces, such as the press, the lec- 
ture platform, and the pulpits, com- 
bine to calumniate the reputation 
of this people, and to destroy them 
by snares that were set for their 
feet. I have seen us delivered from 
those conditions. I have seen that 
notwithstanding all the powers that 
can be brought to oppose this work 
of our God on the earth, to stay the 
growth of His kingdom, we grow 
in spite of all, until today we cry, 
as Brother Whitney has said, "Give 
us room, that we may dwell." 

We are bringing a great emigra- 
tion from the spirit world; and in 
my mission field in the northwest 
we are gathering more souls into 
the Church than we ever have since 
the mission was organized. We 
have the indifference broken down, 
comparatively speaking; and the 
hostility that was once manifest 
against us has come to an end, to a 
great extent, in the northwest. The 
presence of your sons, and the ac- 
quaintance that the people are mak- 
ing with them, and the influence of 
the Spirit of God upon the people 
has caused the feeling of hate and 
prejudice to pass away, and the peo- 
ple's hearts are being softened. I 
do not doubt that in all the missions 
of the United States it is going to 
be harvest time for a few years, to 
gather out the people that are God's, 



and that He intends to bring them 
with songs of everlasting joy into 
His Church, preparatory to His 
coming and the establishment for- 
ever of His kingdom. 

There are some girls and wom- 
en who have come to us in my mis- 
sion field and mourned because they 
had not kept the counsel of their 
parents, and lived up to the train- 
ing they had received at home. The 
children of those women are un- 
blessed and unbaptized, because 
their husbands will not permit these 
ordinances to be administered to- 
their children. When our children 
stray away from the home of their 
youth, Mormonism clings to them, 
and brings them to a sense of the 
awful loss they have sustained. I 
think it is better that a maiden 
should maintain her faith and virtue 
and never wear the crown of wife- 
hood and motherhood in this life, 
than that she should wed an unbe- 
liever. 

God bless you, brethren and sis- 
ters, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

"Lord, dismiss us with Thy bless- 
ing."

entitled, "In the house of many 
mansions." 

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 

( President of Fremont Stake. ) 

I pray for your faith and confi- 
dence, brethren and sisters, in my 
behalf during the few moments that 
I attempt to address you ; and I 
trust that all that shall be said by 
me may meet the divine approval 
of Him whom we have met this af- 
ternoon to worship. 

With your permission I will read 
a clipping from a paper that hap- 
pened to come into my possession 
this morning,dated at Denver, April 
3rd: 

"Lizzie Wertzell, aged 8, and Mary 
Wolf, aged 11, were shot and badly- 
wounded tonight during a riot at Globe- 
ville, a suburb, between the two warring 
factions of the German Congregational 
church. A dozen men were arrested and 
thrown into jail. 

Trouble has been brewing in this 
church for the last four years. The 
churph is divided against itself, one fac- 
tion being determined to oust the pastor, 
Rev. Adam Traudt. 

Recently, the anti-Traudites became 
the dominant power. Last night they 
determined to use force to depose the 
pastor. Traudt armed himself with a 
shotgun, as did several others of his 
friends, and went to the church, where 
they barricaded all of the doors and 
threatened to kill anyone who attempted 
to take possession. The police, assisted 
Traudt in holding the fort all night long. 

All day threats of violence were heard 
against him. Friends of Traudt came 
to his rescue. At 10 o'clock, the two 
factions came together, many children 
taking sides. Shooting followed, and 
when the smoke cleared away the two 
little girls were found lving on the 
ground, suffering from bullet wounds. 
An army of policemen was rushed to 
Globeville from Denver, in autos." 

I read this simply as an illustra- 



tion of conditions that can and have 
been brought about by reason, per- 
haps, in a great measure, of the 
imperfect system of organization 
that has resulted from the various 
churches of Christianity seceding 
from the mother Church. We are 
well aware of the fact that, a few 
centuries ago, Catholicism reigned 
predominant throughout Europe, 
and it was universally conceded that 
the voice of the authorities of that 
church was absolutely the voice of 
God, without the necessity of ap- 
proval by the people. It was gen- 
erally recognized and understood 
that the supreme authority in that 
church was a substitute for the Son 
of God Himself, that he was actual 
successor to the Apostle Peter. 
From the clergy, in those days, the 
people had very little right of ap- 
peal, in fact they had no voice 
whatever. Occasionally, when 
some independent spirit would arise 
among the people, and assert a right 
to be heard in the expression of his 
views and opinions regarding re- 
ligious doctrine, he was either put 
to death or tortured in the most se- 
vere manner, or perhaps imprisoned 
for life ; so that the people dare not, 
under penalty of their lives, assert 
their manhood, or give expression 
to their thoughts or the dictates of 
their own consciences. By reason 
of this condition, such characters 
as Martin Luther, and other re- 
formers, eventually arose in the 
world and courageously asserted 
their rights as men, saying that the 
voice of the people was the voice 
of God ; and they had the fortitude 
of character to maintain their posi- 
tion in this direction, and their right 
of freedom of speech, even in face 
of the penalty of death. A sentence 
uttered by one of these reformers, 
when he was about to be executed, 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is one that will last as long as time 
endures. These are the words that 
came from his lips : "Here I stand. 
Recant I cannot; God help me." 
From these circumstances arose the 
condition that we see today through- 
Out the various Christian organiza- 
tions of the Protestant world, the 
people asserting their rights to have 
their voices supreme in the organiz- 
ation and maintenance of their va- 
rious churches and organizations. 
As an illustration we find the inci- 
dent that happened only yesterday, 
or a day or so ago, wherein mem- 
bers of one of these organizations 
became divided among themselves, 
both factions nearly equal in num- 
ber, each faction contending for 
the right to say who shall be the 
pastor of their church, and result- 
ing in the loss of the lives of two 
precious little girls. 

Here we see illustrated the great 
contention between the mother 
church and her daughters; Chris- 
tianity, as represented in Catholic- 
ism, insisting that the voice of the 
clergy is absolutely the voice of God 
regardless of the minds and con- 
science of the people, and the Pro- 
testant denominations asserting 
that the voice of the people, regard- 
less of their pastors, shall be the 
voice of God regarding who should 
be their minister, or theological or 
religious trainer, preceptor or 
clergy, as the case may be. These 
things have impressed me with the 
thought that the beauty of the or- 
ganization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, stands, 
as I see it, a happy medium between 
the two conditions. It is not that 
the voice of God is necessarily the 
voice of the people, neither is it 
that the voice of the people must 
necessarily be the voice of God. I 
understand the organization of the 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints to be a result of the voice 
of God and the voice of the people 
blending in perfect harmony, bring- 
ing peace and harmony in the 
church, throughout all its organiza- 
tions. As I understand the organ- 
ization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints today, 
I cannot conceive of contention ex- 
isting in it, such as is found in the 
church described in the clipping I 
have read concerning one of the 
churches in one of our neighboring 
states. In our church the most ab- 
solute right is accorded to all its 
members to have full voice, a fair 
expression of thought and opinion 
in all matters pertaining to the or- 
ganization of the Church; but the 
right of nomination comes from 
the presiding authority, and when 
that nomination is sanctioned by the 
people, these two powers or forces 
blend in perfect harmony, and peace 
prevails throughout the entire or- 
ganization. 

In the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints we find the 
Prophet, Seer, and Revelator of the 
Church, who is its president; but 
he does not stand absolute and 
alone. Associated with him are two 
counselors, men who are high 
priests, and these three are sus- 
tained by the confidence and vote 
of the people, every six months dur- 
ing their term of office, which is us- 
ually for life. When any question 
of vital importance comes before 
this Presidency, it is the right of 
the President to ask for the views 
and ideas of his associates, and it 
is their duty to frankly respond in 
detail, as they are inspired by the 
Spirit of God. When' all has thus 
been freely expressed by these two 
counselors, the right of nomination, 
or taking the initiative, proceeds 



ELDER THOMAS E. B AS SETT. 



29 



from the President. His decision is 
indorsed by his counselors, and is 
subsequently submitted to the body 
of the Church and then sustained by 
them as a whole. Not necessarily 
do all questions have to be settled 
in the manner indicated, but, as- 
sociated with those presiding we 
find, in the organization of the 
Church and kingdom of God, the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It 
is the right of the presidency, as I 
understand the organization of the 
Church, to confer with those twelve 
men, who also are sustained by a 
vote of confidence of the people, and 
have them express their views and 
ideas freely, under the inspiration 
of the Spirit of God. But the initi- 
ative, after all is said and done, 
comes from the head, and then it is 
sanctioned by those who have dis- 
cussed the proposition. Unques- 
tionably, in every instance, so far as 
I know, there is unity of action ; 
after these matters have been con- 
sidered and sanctioned by the auth- 
orities who have been sustained by 
the vote of confidence of the peo- 
ple, it is then sustained by the vote 
of all members of the Church. 

I can see in the organization of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints the most perfect sys- 
tem that is possible to be organized 
among men ; it gives to mankind 
the utmost freedom that can be giv- 
en, and still maintains absolute 
unity. There might be given, un- 
der the systems of protestantism 
today, the same absolute right to 
the people to say for themselves 
what shall or what shall not be ; but 
I see in their varied systems of or- 
ganization great aptitude to division 
into factions. We have had revealed 
to us, through the instrumentality 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, a sys- 
tem under which factions can not 



exist in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. I can see in 
this the infinite wisdom of God our 
eternal Father, not the limited wis- 
dom of a boy 14 or even 25 years 
of age. I fail to see today, through- 
out all Christendom, the harmony 
in the organization of church gov- 
ernment that we see existing in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, as instituted through 
the instrumentality of a humble boy, 
and as given by the inspiration of 
God. The longer I live, and the 
more experience. I have in this 
Church, the more I appreciate the 
beauties of it, and the more I glory 
in the growth and development of 
the great latter-day work. And 
here, my brethren and sisters, I em- 
brace the opportunity of testifying 
to you that, if I know anything at 
all in this life, I know that the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints was instituted and is 
maintained by the gift and power 
of God. No power of man could 
have maintained it against all the 
opposition it has had to contend 
with during the seventy-nine years 
of its history. All honor be to our 
fathers and mothers, our grand- 
fathers and grandmothers, who had 
the fortitude of character to stand 
up under all the oppression they en- 
dured, and maintain to the last 
breath the testimony that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired 
of God, and was the means in the 
hand of our heavenly Father of 
restoring the gospel once more to 
the earth. 

I stand before you today as a 
representative of one of the stakes 
that, within the last 26 years, has 
given birth to six other stakes of 
Zion. Twenty-six years ago its or- 
ganization did not comprise more 
than 600 souls. That same section 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of country today embraces not less 
than 25,000 souls, members of the 
Church, and it is now divided into 
seven stakes of Zion, and the moth- 
er stake has a population of nearly 
6,000. I am happy to report that in 
that section of country the work of 
the Lord is progressing rapidly. A 
splendid feeling exists among the 
people. I don't know any among 
the officers of our stake but who are 
observing the Word of Wisdom ; 
and they are true and loyal to the 
president of the Church, Joseph F. 
Smith, as prophet, seer and reve- 
lator, and to the other authorities 
of the Church who will be sustained 
at this conference, including all the 
brethren and sisters who maintain 
positions of trust among the people. 
We are working together loyally 
and unitedly for the good of the 
people, and the development of our 
fair state of Idaho. We say that 
we will welcome any and all of you 
who desire to locate among us. We 
have a large and beautiful country. 
We have stakes of Zion well organ- 
ized, and we are always glad to 
welcome the boys and girls of these 
valleys of the mountains, who have 
heen reared under the droppings of 
the sanctuary, in the environments 
of the Church. We want our young 
men and young women, to remain at 
home, in the various stakes of 
Zion. The longer I live the more I 
appreciate our organizations, and 
the good they are doing to our 
young people. I do not know how 
many of our boys and girls would 
he absolutely loyal to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
were it not for the environment 
thrown around them by the vari- 
ous societies and quorums of the 
Church, as we have them instituted 
today. I say, brethren and sisters, 
fathers and mothers in Israel, it is 



not right to scatter abroad, away 
from the organization of the 
Church. It is one of the tenets of 
Mormonism that this is a gather- 
ing dispensation, that we shall gath- 
er into the valleys of the mountains, 
and be reared under the guidance 
of the servants of God, under the 
inspired teachings that come to us 
from those whom we sustain from 
time to time. We ought not to al- 
low our boys and girls to make 
homes in foreign states or terri- 
tories, away from the environments 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. That is not in 
harmony with the teachings of the 
gospel as revealed in the latter day. 
Let us bring up our boys and girls 
under influences that will shape 
their lives and make of them what 
they should be, children of the 
Saints of God. 

May God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters. May we be united to- 
gether in the bonds of love, and 
not allow any dissensions among us, 
but maintain and sustain all those 
who are called to represent the 
Church and kingdom of God in the 
earth, that harmony may prevail, 
and that the will of God may be 
done among this people. May Zion 
grow and nourish in the earth, as it 
has done in the past, is my desire, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MTJRRIN. 

In standing up in your presence 
this afternoon, my brethren and sis- 
ters, I hope I may be led by the 
Spirit of the Lord to say something 
that will be beneficial to some of 
those gathered in this sacred build- 
ing. My heart was comforted in 
the opening hymn. Ofttimes, 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

abroad in the world, while laboring 
as a missionary, 1 have found a 
great deal of satisfaction in taking 
part with the Saints in the singing 
of this hymn. I do not intend to 
read much of it, I will however 
read a verse or two to this con- 
gregation. It may not be Scrip- 
ture altogether, and yet, in my op- 
inion, the poet has set forth the 
truth. There are many passages of 
Scripture that can be brought 
forth to support and sustain the 
views that are presented by the 
writer of this poem : 

"In every condition, in sickness, 
in health, 
In poverty's vale or abounding in 
wealth, 

At home or abroad, on the land or 
the sea, 

As thy days may demand, so thy 
succor shall be. 

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned 
for repose 
I will not, I cannot, desert to his 
foes ; 

That soul, though all hell should 
endeavor to shake, 
I'll never, no never, no never for- 
sake !" 

Mv brethren and sisters, many a 
soul has been made to rejoice, when 
far away from home, in taking part 
with the Saints in singing these 
precious words. Many of us have 
learned, bv our own experiences, 
that the Lord is perfectly able, un- 
der every circumstance, and in 
everv condition, whether it be at 
home or abroad, to give that help, 
succor, and strength that is neces- 
sary for the accomplishment of His 
purooses. He Qualifies His ser- 
vants for the performance of the 
l-ifom that are assigned to them in 
the preaching of the Gospel and 



the accomplishment of all other 
work necessary for the building up 
of the kingdom of God. The words 
of the hymn indicate that our Fa- 
ther in heaven is a being of love, 
which is in perfect accord with the 
teachings of the Scriptures. The 
Scriptures jjproclaim that God is 
love ; that He sent His Only Begot- 
ten Son into the world because of 
His exceeding great love for man- 
kind that all men who would be- 
live in His precious name might ob- 
tain salvation. Christ Jesus was 
not sent into the world to condemn 
the world, the Scripture says; but 
was sent into the world that men 
through Him might obtain ever- 
lasting life. 

I ofttimes think, that as a people, 
we ought to be able to discover, 
more fully and completely than any 
other people that God is indeed and 
of a truth, a being of love for there 
are doctrines that have been re- 
vealed to the Latter-day Saints that 
are not understood or believed in 
by the world generally, that show 
in a remarkable manner the mercy 
and justice of the Lord, that bear 
strong testimony to the love of God 
and that contain within themselves 
the evidence of divine inspiration. 

In conversing with a gentleman 
a few days ago, he made the re- 
mark that the cfoctrines of Mor- 
monism, the fundamental doctrines 
of the Gospel, those that are spoken 
of generally as the first principles 
of the Gospel, annealed to him be- 
cause thev are so much in accord 
with the doctrines that were tai<~'-' 
by the Redeemer and His Apos- 
tles. He made this statement: If 
vou could onlv leave out Joseph 
Smith, and the Book of Mormon, it 
would be a very easy matter for me 
to believe in Mormonism. But I 
cannot comnrehend, he added, wrn 
there should be any new revelation. 



32

or any new volume of Scripture. 
I asked hSm the question if he 
did not' believe that our Father in 
heaven was a being of love, and of 
course he answered that he did so 
believe. Then si inquired of him if 
it did not seem as though it would 
be necessary for a God of love to 
have in remembrance all His peo- 
ple? How could he reconcile belief 
in the love of God with the theory 
that prevails in the world, that half 
the people of the world had been 
forgotten by our Father in ages 
that are gone by, that He had re- 
vealed Himself only upon one hem- 
isphere, and had overlooked 
the millions of men who dwelt upon 
the other hemisphere. I quoted to 
him the Scripture wherein the Sav- 
ior, having, apparently the thought 
in mind that He was to accomplish 
the work of which He was speak- 
ing to His disciples, after His cruci- 
fixion, — referring to the necessity 
there was for the laying down of 
His life, — said unto them : "Other 
sheep I have which are not of this 
fold ; them also I must visit, and 
they shall hear my voice, and there 
shall be one fold and one shep- 
herd." Where are the other sheep, 
or where were they, when they 
were spoken of by the Redeemer 
of the world? Mormonism makes 
answer, and so far as I know there 
is no other religious denomination 
in the world that makes such a reas- 
onable explanation of the declar- 
ation of Jesus Christ, that He must 
visit other sheep that were not of 
that fold. His disciples were ac- 
quainted only wHth that fold in 
their own country. His apostles 
carried the GosoeVto the nations 
round about, with whom they were 
familiar, but there was, without 
question, some other people with 
whom those to whom he was talk- 
ing were not familiar, a people 



in some other part of the 
world, they also were to hear the 
voice of the Redeemer, and have 
the opportunity of receiving the 
same glad tidings of good things, 
the same glorious Gospel that was 
the power of God unto salvation. 

Instead of men hesitating about 
receiving the doctrines of the Gos- 
pel as they have been revealed in 
the age in which we are living, and 
as contained in the Book of Mor- 
mon it seems to me that men should 
readily discover in the Book of 
Mormon additional evidence of the 
truth of the statement in the old 
Scriptures, that God is a being of 
love, and that He has had in mem- 
ory in past ages, as well as at the 
present time, all His creatures. All 
men, as the Scriptures teach, have 
been created of the same flesh, no 
difference whatever, and God, their 
Creator, is no respector of persons, 
but He is the same yesterday, to- 
day and forever. The very fact 
that God revealed Himself through 
His Only Begotten Son to the an- 
cient inhabitants of this continent, 
taught them the Gospel, conferred 
upon them the authority of the holy 
Priesthood, and filled them with the 
same joy and happiness that were 
given to their brethren afar off, 
is very strong evidence of the love 
of God and, in my mind, a won- 
derful testimony of the truth of the 
Book of Mormon, and of the in- 
spiration of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in translating the sacred 
record. 

So it is in relation to the great 
doctrines believed in by the Latter- 
day Saints, that the Gospel is eter- 
nal, that the mercy of God endureth 
forever, and that men are not eter- 
nally lost who have not heard the 
Gosoel in mortality. How could 
Cod. the Father, be regarded as a 
God of love if the many millions of 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

men who have inhabited this earth 
and who have passed away without 
ever having heard the sound of 
the Gospel, are to be eternally lost? 
That does not savor of love. That 
does not stamp the Creator of the 
world as being 1 possessed of the at- 
tribute of love to any very marked 
degree. But ! when we apply the 
doctrine that has been revealed 
through the Prr^het Joseph Smith 
to all the peoples of the earth, 
whether they live now or in the 
past, or may live in the future, that 
there can be no condemnation, no 
real death, no such thing as dam- 
nation, without the rejection of the 
voice of the Lord, we commence to 
know something of the love of 
God. We learn that every soul 
must hear, and that those who have 
lived and had not the opportunity, 
in the flesh, to hear the glad mes- 
sage of the Gospel will be sought 
after in the spirit world until they 
are frund, and every soul will thus 
be left standing upon the same kind 
of foundation, exercising the judg- 
ment and agency that the Lord of 
heaven has given, either to receive 
or reject His message. That vin- 
dicates God as a being of love. To 
my mind, it tells a marvelous story 
of inspiration, and of the power of 
God that rested upon the young 
man Toseph, as he taught and re- 
vealed to the peoples of the earth 
the glorious message of truth. 

Another doctrine revealed by 
this same Prophet, Joseph Smith, 
that bears testimony of the love of 
God. is the salvation of the little 
children of the world. Men have 
believed thnt thev were lost, unless 
certain ordinances had been admin- 
istered to them. It has been quite 
generally believed that the little in- 
fant at the mother's breast could 
not he s^ved without hantism, not- 
withstanding the fact that the great 



majority of all the infjants that 
have ever been born into the world 
have gone to the grave without bap- 
tism. It is hard to understand the 
perfection or love of God in any- 
thing of this character; but, when 
the teaching of sacred truth is ap- 
plied, as it has been given by the 
power of inspiration, and by the 
commandment of God, the won- 
derful, marvelous and glorious 
doctrine is revealed that all 
children, who have not come 
to years of accountability, are 
saved in the celestial kingdom of 
God through the atonement of 
Jesus Christ. In the law of God 
manifested in a revelation of this 
glorious character, who can be so 
dense as not to discern that the 
Gospel that has been revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
is, as we declare, the power of God 
unto salvation? 

These principles are making their 
way among men, and they will con- 
time to extend, they cannot be 
staid. Such glorious principles 
bear the stamp of divinity, and the 
decree has gone forth from God, 
in His majesty, power and strength, 
that the world shall know the truth. 
When the world comes to know the 
truth, among other discoveries that 
will be made will be the fact that 
Mormonism is not a delusion, or a 
myth, but a revelation from our 
Father in heaven, the way He has 
appointed for the salvation of men. 

May God help us ever to remem- 
ber and hold fast to the truth, that 
we may save our souls, and be in- 
strumental in spreading this glad 
news among the people, far and 
wide, until k .all men shall be left 
without excuse. This is our mis- 
sion and our responsibility. We are 
under obligation to manifest before 
mankind that into our souls has 
come the love of God, by being

willing to do our part in the pro 
clamation of the Gospel and the 
building up of His work. God help 
us to do it humbly, faithfully and 
well, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

of God," was sung by Sisters

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

We certainly have been impress- 
ed, in the remarks that have been 
made, with the unbounded love 
which our Father in heaven has 
manifested towards His children. 
Are we not indebted to the Lord 
for every blessing that we enjoy? 
Is it not true that we owe to Him 
the very existence we have upon 
the earth, the power to live and 
have a being, to associate with 
each other, to communicate our 
views, our thoughts, and reflec- 
tions, even the power to think and 
give expression to thought? With- 
out these precious gifts there would 
be no joy, we could have no de- 
light, we could have no happiness 
upon this earth. Our social inter- 
course would be interrupted; there 
would be no such thing to be ex- 
perienced or enjoyed. It seems to 
me that it is wholesome for us to 
let our minds go out in contempla- 
tion of the wonderful gifts we have 
received from our Heavenly Father. 
It seems to me that it is whole- 
some to meditate (Upon these things 
until we can thoroughly and com- 
pletely convince ourselves that all 
happiness, that every blessinf. 
flows from Him. We should be 
full of gratitude to our Father, 
acknowledge Him as the Giver of 
all good ; and we should plead 
with Him to help us to appreciate 



His blessings even as they flow 
from His all-bountiful hands. We 
cannot say too much regarding the 
love of God to His children. "He 
sent His only begotten Son that 
whosoever should believe on Him 
should not perish, but have ever- 
lasting life." In this instance, my 
brethren and sisters, we find the 
greatest manifestation of the love 
of God for His children. 

In the remarks that were made in 
the opening meeting of our con- 
ference, President Joseph F. Smith 
told us of his determination to de- 
vote his life in the service of God. 
I felt impressed thereby, and feel 
now impressed with the fact that 
there is an object lesson for the 
Latter-day Saints : while we are 
recipients of that matchless love 
which comes from heaven, what 
are we going to do about it? To 
use the words of President Smith, 
"what shall we do" to show that we 
appreciate the blessings which God 
is pouring- so bounteously upon us, 
His children? This same senti- 
ment was followed up by his coun- 
selors, and it seems to me that it 
is an appeal to the Latter-day 
Saints to show gratitude unto their 
heavenly Father. 

We read in the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants words like 
these: "In nothing doth man .of- 
fend God, and against none it His 
wrath kindled, save those who will 
not acknowledge Him in all 
things." The sin of the world is 
ingratitude to God. Against none 
is the wrath of our heavenly Fath- 
er kindled excepting those who so 
far forget Him, that they will not 
acknowledge Him in all things, 
that He is the Giver of all good, 
that we are dependent upon Him 
for all that we receive. It seems 
to me that there should be a reso- 
lution on the part of all Latter-day 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

Saints to express themselves just 
as President Smith did this morn- 
ing, and show in their lives that 
they propose to give the Lord the 
very, best there is in them; in other 
words, that we should continuous- 
ly serve the Lord, devoting our 
lives, our energies, our talents, 
whatsoever we have, and whatso- 
ever we are, in the service of God. 
I wish to call attention to the fact 
that, if we do not serve God in all 
things we are liable to serve the ad- 
versary; and just exactly where 
we discontinue our service to God 
that is where such danger begins. 
Do what I may, every moment 
of my time is devoted either 
in the service of God or in the ser- 
vice of mammon; there is hardly 
any middle course. We must serve 
the Lord in everything we do, for 
the Lord requires constant service 
to Him. And is not that what is 
meant when the Lord commanded 
His children to "pray without 
ceasing" Is it not the condition of 
the heart, this ceaseless prayer; 
and are we not always in the at- 
titude of praying. "Prayer is 
the soul's sincere desire." What 
are your desires, my brethren and 
sisters? Do you desire the triumph 
of Zion ? Do you desire to see truth 
prevail? Do you desire to see the 
kingdom of God established upon 
the earth? If you do, and do it all 
the time, it is a prayer of right- 
eousness unto the Lord. But if, for 
one moment, you lose that desire, 
then indeed have you ceased to 
pray to God but you have begun 
to yield to the adversary. Then 
ought we not to choose this day 
whom we will serve, God or mam- 
mon? Let it be our determination 
to serve the Lord with full purpose 
of heart, and make it; a real service 
nnto the Lord. 

What does the Lord require of 



us? Have we ever stopped to read 
the Scriptures and find out what it 
is that God requires of His child- 
ren, in appreciation of the great 
blessings we receive from Him? 
"Son, give me thine heart." There 
is a good deal of meaning in that. 
The heart is the organ of vitality, 
the organ of life; and when the 
Lord said, "Give me thine heart," 
it meant, Son give me thy life, 
that it may be devoted in the ser- 
vice of God. That is what it 
means. It does not necessarily fol- 
low that, because we are to serve 
God continuously, that we are to 
engage, at all times, in what is 
commonly known as the Church 
work. O no; we have our avoca- 
tions to follow. But in each of 
these we may serve God, and we 
ought to see to it that everything 
we do is in reality a service unto 
the most high God. He requires 
it at our hands, and will not ap- 
prove any divergence from that 
path. We must not look upon sin 
with any degree of allowance. We 
find ourselves in mortality, in pos- 
session of weaknesses and imper- 
fections, but let us struggle on, 
serving the Lord, keeping His 
commandments, and we will be 
cleased from sin. But if we let 
up for one moment, the adversary 
is gaining. Then let us fig-ht the 
good fight and keep the faith, re- 
jecting evil at every turn, and 
never surrender. Every surrender 
is a service to the evil one. We can- 
not obtain permission at any time 
to serve the evil one; we ought not 
to have any such desire in our 
hearts. We can serve God, not 
only in our houses o£_ worship, but 
we can serve Him upon the field ; 
at the bench, in the workshop; in 
every avocation of life, in our 
amusements, in all that we set our 
hands to do. Tf there be work

assigned to us that cannot be done 
in harmony with the will of God, 
then do not do it. If there be 
amusements that are contrary to 
the spirit of rightousness, then do 
not participate in that kind of 
amusement ; only in those occupa- 
tions, pleasures and pastimes in 
which we can carry on our service 
of God should we engage our- 
selves. 

My brethren and sisters, I have 
an abiding faith in this work. I 
know the truth of Mormonism as 
it has been revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph, and I hope that 
every one present is in possession 
of that testimony, for it is the 
power of God unto salvation, if we 
will only be faithful and true. The 
Lord has done His part by us ; let 
us see to it that we do our part, 
that we may be entitled to salva- 
tion and exaltation in His presence 
that is promised to the faithful, I 
ask it through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

I never like to preach to Latter - 
day Saints who have already been 
over-fed with such spiritual nou- 
rishment and are not hungry; it 
seems like wasting effort. I have 
read somewhere that "Silence is 
golden," and I have been trying 
for the past year to think, and keep 
silent. I do not think I have ever 
made as great an effort during my 
labors in the ministry, and among 
the people of this Church, to look 
at both sides of every question. I 
am not speaking of the gospel; to 
that there is only one side, and 
that is the right side. But there 
are other things that I have been 
trying to understand, and see both 
sides and then keep still. I think 
some of you are very much like 



I am; I have said some things that 
I am sorry were said and printed. 
I never know just how I will begin 
nor how I will end. 

I have been thinking of late, and 
during my time of thought, I have 
hunted for scripture and something 
to convince me that I was think- 
thing in the right direction, and that 
it was approved by those who are 
in authority. I will read some of it 
to you ; it is not original ; there is 
very little that is original : 

"I want to come to the hearts of the 
people. It is a blessed thing that the 
heart has an instinct which tells it who 
has a right to teach it. The world cares 
little for theorists and theories — little for 
schools and school men, little for any- 
thing a man has to utter that has not 
previously been distilled in the Alembic 
of his life. I come to you with shoes 
worn and dusty with the walk upon life's 
highway, with face bronzed by fierce sun, 
and muscles knit by conflict with the 
evils of the age. * * I do not knock 
at the human heart with gloved hands, 
and an attire borrowed for the occasion." 

You ought to know that, Latter- 
day Saints. I want to say to you, 
as far as I am concerned individ- 
ually, I do not live altogether for 
myself. Does your own heart tell 
you, after my pilgrimage and labors 
among this people, if I have a right 
to teach you. I haven't been raised 
with a silver spoon in my mouth. 
I am not highly cultured. From 
the day I was 15 years old I have 
fought my battles practically alone. 
I am not old yet. I will tell you a 
great truth which is "To know thy- 
self, oh man," and then let the 
other fellow alone. One of the good 
sisters said to me, "Golden if you 
wouldn't talk so much about your- 
self, it would be a good thing." 
Well, I thought to myself, it would 
be a good thing if you would talk 
about yourself and let other people

alone. I know more about myself 
than any other person on earth, 
and I am going to try to keep 
some of it quiet, if I can. 

I have read about the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I have the story 
of the Prophet, and it is a wonder- 
ful story for a boy to tell. About 
those two personages that came to 
him, also John the Baptist, Peter, 
James and John. To me it is very 
wonderful. Do you believe it? If 
that is not true, Joseph Smith was 
the biggest fraud that ever came 
to a people on earth. There has 
never been a more sacrilegious thing 
uttered by man, if it is not true. 
Now, I say, do you believe it ? Do 
I believe it? I believe everything 
that has been revealed to the Proph- 
et Joseph' Smith. If any principle 
that has been revealed to the Proph- 
et is not true, then it is all wrong, 
as far as I . am concerned. There 
is no use of mincing over it. Every 
Latter-day Saint in the Church 
should receive every truth, or else 
none of it. I believe it all. I be- 
lieve every word of it. I "believe 
all that God has revealed, all that 
He does now reveal, and I believe 
the Lord will yet reveal many 
great and important things pertain- 
ing to the kingdom of God." I be- 
lieve all that God has reveajed, as 
fast as I can understand and com- 
prehend it ; and I believe that God 
will yet reveal many great and im- 
portant things. I am not sure if 
we will be prepared to receive all 
or not. Joseph Smith said the Lord 
had revealed things to him which if 
he had repeated to the people they 
would have taken his life. It is a 
good thing he didn't; we have 
more truths and doctrine than we 
now live up to. 

"We believe in being honest, true, 
chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in 
doing good to all men." I accept 



that with all my heart. A man 
must be honest, and he must be 
true, and he must tie chaste and 
benevolent, virtuous, and continue 
doing good to all men. What can , 
God do for a man who is not hon- 
est? You may baptize him every 
fifteen minutes, but if he does not 
repent, he will come up out of the 
water just as dishonest as ever. 
What can God do for a liar who 
refuses to repent? Can the Lord 
save him? He can't claim salva- 
tion. Baptising him in water will 
not settle the trouble, unless you 
keep him under. (Laughter.) What 
can the Lord do with people who 
are not virtuous, unless they re- 
pent? You cannot change the laws 
of the Lord. Men may deceive men ; 
they may deceive apostles; they 
may deceive the President of the 
Church ; they may even get into the 
temple, but that would not make 
them virtuous. You may confer the 
Holy Ghost upon them by the lay- 
ing on of hands, but the Holy Ghost 
does not remain with the unrepent- 
ant; it will not remain in an un- 
clean tabernacle. To deceive men 
is easy, but I want to tell you in 
the name of Israel's God, and this 
thought should be burned into the 
souls of our sons and daughters, 
that unless they repent of all their 
sins and cease immoral practices, 
they cannot remain in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The Holy Ghost will not stay with 
them; they will not have the testi- 
mony of Jesus. This doctrine is 
true. 

I have tried to be generous in my 
sentiments, and be on the right 
side ; I have tried to be tolerant, not 
intolerent, I have tried to respect 
men's opinions, and I have discov- 
ered that we do not always see 
things alike. We may as far as 
the gospel is concerned, but we are 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a long way from it in other things. 
In temporal things we do not suffi- 
ciently respect each other's opin- 
ions. Are we going to sit in judg- 
ment upon men ? I am not in favor 
* of it. I am not in sympathy with 
men who are intolerant, I am afraid 
of them. What does the Lord say? 
They were trying to tempt the Savi- 
or just as they have tried to tempt 
the Latte-day Saints. We are be- 
ing tempted and tested. We are 
being dazzled and bewildered by the 
things of the world, and some are 
trying to make men offenders for a 
word. The Savior said to those 
who were tempting him : — 

"Every kingdom divided against 
itself is brought to desolation." We 
can talk about other churches that 
Brother Bassett has been reading 
about, but there is a division 
amongst other people than the 
Christian churches, even among 
the people of the Latter-day 
Church. It is a kingdom divided 
against itself, to some extent, on 
temperance and political questions, 
and they are considered weighty 
problems too. "A house divided 
against itself falleth." "If Satan 
be divided against himself, how 
shall his kingdom stand?" The 
Latter-day Saints must be united 
to be successful. It is a great 
warfare between Satan and the 
Savior, and to some men it would 
appear as if Satan was going to 
be victorious. Not so. Through 
long continued patience, the vic- 
tory will be the Lord's. It may take 
years, yea hundreds of years, but, 
as Brother McMurrin so beautiful- 
ly portrayed to you, God will save 
His children after all. A condition 
of antagonism puts me a good deal 
in mind of a spectacle analogous 
to that represented in the caricature 
called the combat of the two ser- 
pents ; after having devoured every- 



thing around them, the two reptiles 
attacked each other, finally there re- 
mained on the battle field but two 
tails. 

Now, brethren, let us repent, if 
we have got any bitterness in our 

hearts toward each other, let us be 
generous, and forgiving. No man 
has any influence or power for 
good when angry. It is "amen to 
the priesthood and the authority of 
that man when he uses unrighteous 
dominion," etc. It doesn't matter 
who he is. When a man has the 
Holy Ghost his heart is full of 
meekness, it is full of love un- 
feigned. He loves the souls of the 
children of men and he realizes 
how precious they are in the sight 
of _ God. May we as Latter-day 
Saints enjoy the fullness of the 
Holy Spirit, I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

God's Kingdom on earth to unite with 
the Heavenly Kingdom. — Conditions 
essential to admission into the King- 
dom. — Faithful Saints sustained by 
the Hob' Spirit. — Evil is overcome 
by resistance. 

It is nearly time to bring our 
meeting to a close. I feel that we 
have had a good service. I can bear 
testimony to the truth of what has 
been said this afternoon. 

I desire, in the few moments that 
remain, to express some sentiments 
which I have in my heart with re- 
gard to this work. We have in the 
65th section of the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants a revelation on 
prayer, given through the Prophet 
Joseph, the Seer, in the year 1831. 
From this revelation I read the fol- 
lowing : 

"The keys of the kingdom of God 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS.

are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the gospel roll 
forth unto the ends of the earth, as the 
stone which was cut out of the mountain 
without hands shall roll forth until it has 
filled the whole earth; yea, a voice cry- 
ing, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, 
prepare ye the supper of the Lamb, 
make ready for the bridegroom ; pray 
unto the Lord, call upon His holy name, 
make known His wonderful works among 
the people; call upon the Lord, that His 
kingdom may go forth upon the earth, 
that the inhabitants thereof may receive 
it, and be prepared for the days to 
come, in the which the Son of Man shall 
come down from heaven, clothed in the 
brightness of His glory, to meet the 
kingdom of God which is set up on the 
earth; wherefore may the kingdom of 
God go forth, that the kingdom of 
heaven may come, that thou, O God, 
mayest be glorified in heaven so on 
earth, that thine enemies may be sub- 
dued ; for thine is the honor, power and 
glory, for ever. Amen." 

Here it is very plainly set forth 
that God has established His king- 
dom upon the earth, and the time 
will come when His kingdom which 
is established in heaven shall come 
forth to meet His kingdom upon 
the earth. The Lord has made clear 
to us that no sinful thing can enter 
into His presence. He dwells in 
the celestial kingdom. The king- 
dom of God in heaven is most per- 
fect, and all that pertains unto it. 

We have heard some remarks 
with reference to the perfection of 
the Church of Christ, organized on 
the earth in these last days, through 
the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. This kingdom of 
our Father is most perfect, the 
Church and kingdom, so far as it 
has been revealed to us. We know 
not but there are some things per- 
taining to the perfection of the or- 
ganization of the Church not yet 
revealed, for, as has been stated, 
we believe all that God has revealed, 
and we believe that He will yet re- 



veal many important things per- 
taining to the Church and kingdom 
of God upon the earth, as well as 
doctrine. This Church, then, and 
embryotic kingdom of God, is typ- 
ical of the kingdom of our Father 
in heaven; and as no sinful thing 
can enter the kingdom of God in 
heaven, go where our Father is and 
enjoy celestial glory with Him and 
with our elder brother and Savior, 
so we cannot enter this preparatory 
kingdom in our sins, but every man 
and woman must of necessity re- 
pent of sin, with broken heart and 
contrite spirit, or they cannot ob- 
tain admission. If they have been 
admitted under any other condi- 
tions, they are still in their sins 
even though they may have yielded 
obedience to the ordinance of bap- 
tism, and though that ordinance 
may have been performed in the 
way the Lord has appointed, by im- 
mersion in water, and by one who 
has held the authority, their sins are 
not remitted; and though hands 
may be laid upon their heads to 
confer the Holy Ghost, the Holy 
Ghost has not come upon them, and 
the testimony has never been borne 
through the Holy Ghost to their 
souls concerning the truth of the 
work and the acceptance by the 
Lord of their course of life. We 
must begin at the bottom. We must 
repent of our sins before we can ob- 
tain acceptable admission into the 
Church. Repentance comes through 
faith, through the hearing of the 
word, and we hear the word by the 
preaching of those whom the Lord 
has appointed. We learn of our 
Father, and of His Son, and of His 
gospel, the provision made for the 
salvation of the children of men, 
by searching the scriptures. As the 
Savior said, "Search the scriptures 
for in them ye think ye have eternal 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



life, and they are they which testify 
of me." If we close up our hearts 
and minds, give ourselves over to 
evil thoughts, disregard the will and 
wishes of our Father, and disregard 
the influence of His Holy Spirit, 
which actuates the soul of every 
man to know good from evil, and 
do not bend our energies in the way 
of doing good, cleave to the truth 
and eschew evil, the condemnation 
of the Lord will follow us. 

The Lord expects us to trust in 
Him; He expects us to seek after 
Him, and that we may have faith 
in Him, and having faith in Him 
and in His Son, our Redeemer, He 
expects us to yield obedience to His 
will, keep His commandments, for- 
sake all sin, and be advocates of 
the truth. That is our mission. I 
bear you witness today, I do know, 
for I have yielded obedience to the 
law, that I have had a testimony 
from the Lord, through His Holy 
Spirit, that my course in so doing 
has been accepted of Him. I know 
that the gospel is the truth; and I 
know that His saving power is had 
by those who have yielded obedi- 
ence unto it, who have rid them- 
selves of sin and wickedness, who 
have received the Holy Spirit in 
their souls, and hope for a glorious 
resurrection and the blessings of 
eternal life. All such can look back 
upon their past lives and contrast 
their present with the former condi- 
tion. They do know most positive- 
ly that the gospel has been a sav- 
ing power in their lives ; they know 
that if they retrace their steps and 
resort to those evil things which 
were part of their conduct before 
this still small voice, these words of 
life came to them, it means their 
utter condemnation and destruction. 
The Lord comforts His faithful 
people all along the pathway of life. 



As we undertake to do what is 
right, to aid in His cause, and to 
bring souls to a knowledge of the 
truth, He blesses us with the mani- 
festations of His Spirit in our 
work, by dreams and vision at 
night, by the gift of prophecy, the 
gift of tongues, and by the gift of 
healing. In numerous ways the 
Lord, all along the line of our life's 
work, gives encouragement, and 
faith, and knowledge, and the hope 
of a glorious resurrection; we are 
not left in doubt and darkness. Such 
is my testimony to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters. We are not yet 
perfect in this earthly kingdom, 
though it is our Father's. Though 
we have repented of our sins, man 
is prone to do evil, even as the 
sparks fly upward. When we find 
ourselves overcome by that which 
is evil, the Lord requires that we 
will, with broken hearts and con- 
trite spirits, undertake again to for- 
sake those evils, return to them no 
more. With the Lord's help we 
will finally succeed and triumph 
over evil; just as he who was once 
addicted to the use of liquor, every 
time he passed the saloon going to 
and from his day's work, was 
tempted to go inside. After a time, 
by resisting that evil, remembering 
that intoxicating liquor was not 
good for him, the temptation passed 
away; the Lord strengthened him 
against that evil, and he became 
able to successfully withstand it. 
Such is our mission here in this 
life, to battle all the day long with 
ourselves; and as we obtain addi- 
tional light and knowledge, to make 
known that light and knowledge to 
others, that they may participate 
with us in the joy of that knowl- 
edge, and the hope of obtaining ev- 
erlasting life through fighting the 
battle faithfully to the end.

May the blessing of the Lord be 
upon us all. Assuredly we all need 
the Lord's help; we need strength 
from Him. As we engage faithfully 
to overcome, to perfect within our- 
selves the attributes of our eternal 
Father, He will help us, and we will 
succeed and triumph. May the Lord 
bless us to this end, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

An anthem entitled, "Our God 
shall be glorified," words by Elder 
Richard S. Home, and music by 
Prof. Charles J. Thomas, was ren- 
dered by the Temple choir. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Josiah E. Hickman. 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 

The Tabernacle and Assembly 
Hall were uncomfortably crowded, 
and thousands were unable to ob- 
tain admittance, consequently, the 
weather being favorable, an out- 
door meeting of the Conference 
was held, at 2 p. m., near the Bu- 
reau of Information building, at 
which 2,500 persons were present. 

Elder Benjamin Goddard presid- 
ed, and Prof. Elihu Call conducted 
the singing. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"High on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Jacob F. Gates. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD. 

It is gratifying, my brethren and 
sisters, to observe the crowds of 
our Church members so interested 
in the work of the Lord that they 
come from the south and the north, 



the east and the west, from Canada 
on the north to Mexico on the south, 
for the purpose of attending our 
annual conference. 

We realize the disadvantages at- 
tending this open air meeting, but 
we are thankful that we have not 
the same disadvantages nor the 
spirit of antagonism that we so of- 
ten encounter upon the street cor- 
ners of large cities, where peo- 
ple are not of our faith. The breth- 
ren, however, who will address you 
have been accustomed to street 
meetings. They have good voices. 
They are filled with the Spirit of 
the Lord, and I think they can make 
you all hear. 

Upon this block, we also have a 
missionary work constantly in op- 
eration. I simply want to refer to 
the fulfillment of prophecy in con- 
nection with our work here, as it 
may be particularly interesting to 
some of our friends who are now 
in the audience, and who are not of 
our faith. Every day in the week, 
every day of the year, from early 
morning until late at night, we are 
entertaining "strangers within our 
gates," explaining unto them the 
mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and all that the structures 
upon this block stand for. Amongst 
other things we direct special atten- 
tion to our magnificent Temple, a 
monument to the faith of the peo- 
ple, and a palpable evidence of the 
restoration of the gospel. In that 
connection, too,' these words are 
now verily fulfilled : 

"But, in the last days it shall come to 
pass, that the mountain of the house of 
the Lord shall be established in the top 
of the mountains, and it shall be exalted 
above the hills; and people shall flow 
unto it. And many nations shall come 
and say [mark you, they are saying it 
every day of the year, and this prophecy 
is thus fulfilled, for from every nation 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



under heaven people are coming, and 
saying], Come, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, and to the house 
of the God of Jacob, and He will teach 
us of His ways, and we will walk in His 
paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, 
and the word of the Lord from Jerusa- 
lem." 

I pray that the Spirit that usual- 
ly is present in our sacred gather- 
ings may rest upon the assembly in 
this open air meeting, that the word 
of the Lord may be given unto you, 
and that the Spirit may interpret it 
to your understanding. I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I con- 
sider it a privilege that we are per- 
mitted to gather together and wor- 
ship the Lord in this, the 79th, 
annual conference of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
With you, I rejoice in the instruc- 
tions that we have received this 
morning ; and I ask myself the ques- 
tion asked by President Smith, 
"What am I doing to keep the 
commandments of the Lord?" Is 
my heart as willing to sacrifice as 
were our brethren and sisters who 
were instrumental in establishing 
the church in the earth 79 years 
ago? I rejoice that my grand-par- 
ents were among the first to hear 
the message of truth, and that they 
had faith enough to receive and live 
the same. I wonder, with our op- 
portunities, as young men and 
women, after our years of training, 
if we are as anxious to accept the 
truth, and as anxious to serve the 
Lord as they in that day. There 
is more truth in the world than 
when this church was organized, 



but it seems to one we are slowei 
to accept the truth, especially if it is 
called a "religious" truth. This is 
my experience with men and wom- 
en of the world, during eight years 
in preaching the Gospel. 

When you tell broad-minded 
men and women in the world that 
we are the only church in the earth 
that is .right, they are shocked, and 
horrified at our "narrow" concep- 
tion of the love of God; yet it is 
true, and when understood in the 
light of the restored gospel it is 
the broadest conception possible. 
I wonder if the Latter-day Saints 
stop to consider what a wonderful 
and terrible statement it must be 
to the people of the world, to be 
told that they are without the right 
to officiate in the name of God. and 
that we are the only people in the 
world who have the right. I told 
one man who has been prominent 
in governmental affairs in the Unit- 
ed States the past four years, that 
while the people of the world mav 
be moral teachers, may be great 
educators, and may deliver truths 
to the children of men, and are 
exerting wonderful influences for 
the civilization of the world and 
for the education of the children 
of men, yet, on one point the great 
and vital point of authority we dif- 
fer with them. After they have 
been taught the truth, and believe 
the same, we claim to be the only 
people who have the right to take a 
man or woman into the waters of 
baptism and there say, "Having 
been commissioned of Jesus Christ 
I baptize you in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Ghost." This man said to 
me, "I can see why all other church- 
es unite against you, after you pit 
yourselves against the rest of the 
world with that statement." 

I often wonder if the Latter- 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



48 



day Saints appreciate that state- 
ment, and realize our position. If 
it be true and we believe that we 
are the only people in the world 
that have the right to officiate in 
the name of God, what a labor is 
resting upon our shoulders, and 
what a responsible position we oc- 
cupy. Less than fifty thousand 
men in the world having the right 
to baptize the rest of the people 
who come to believe in the name 
of God. We understand that there 
is about one-third of the world 
today who, nominally, believe in 
Christ. There are many millions 
of these people who truly believe 
in Christ. They firmly and honest- 
ly believe in Him, from all the light 
that they have received, and they 
believe, too, that they have been 
initiated into the Church of Christ, 
and that when they die they will 
be saved in His presence. They 
believe they have done all that they 
need to do; and yet, as Latter-day 
Saints, we know, from the tesimony 
that burns in our bosom, there is 
yet something for them to do. It 
is encouraging to know they are 
fast believing that God is our Fath- 
er, in very deed. They are fast 
acquiring a genuine belief that Je- 
sus Christ is in very deed the Son 
of God; and also believing that 
there is something more yet to be 
done ; that men will be called of 
God, sometime, to officiate in ordi- 
nances of the Gospel that have not 
yet been officiated in by them in 
their churches. 

One minister told me a few days 
ago, "Mr. Ellsworth, we believe 
in the restoration of the Gospel." 
"Why," I said, "that seems strange. 
I have never heard a minister de- 
clare that before in my life." I 
asked him how he believed in the 
restoration, and he gave me almost 
word for word the argument we 



use: that there was an apostasy, 
and that, after the reformation, 
little by little God has revealed the 
truth to this church and that church, 
through this man and that woman. 
"We have today much more truth 
than we had fifty years ago ; and 
we believe that more truth will 
be given to us just as rapidly as 
we are prepared to receive it. If 
it is the Lord's will that we be 
baptized by immersion, we will be 
glad to be baptized just as soon as 
we feel that it is an important thing. 
If it is important, as the scriptures 
hint, that we should have the laying 
on of hands, we believe that the 
Lord will make it manifest to us 
through our churches. If it is im- 
portant that we do other things 
that you speak of, we believe that 
He will restore them to us through 
one church or through another. To 
all who are moved upon by the 
Spirit of God to receive those 
truths, they will be essential in their 
lives ; but just as long as this or 
that principle does not dawn upon 
us, we do not feel responsible to 
obey it. We feel now that the most 
essential thing is to believe in God ; 
and inasmuch as we believe in God, 
we believe we will be saved, but 
we believe also that it is essential 
to live up to all the truths that 
He reveals to us." 

I told him that that was a pretty 
good argument, and I believe that 
it will do good. The Lord will 
hold us responsible for what light 
we have received. As Latter-day • 
Saints believing that God, our Fath- 
er, 79 years ago, re-established the 
Church, with such officers as were 
placed in it in the days of Jesus 
Christ, and that He has revealed 
to us all the light and blessings, 
and principles that have been re- 
vealed or taught by holy men of old 
since the world began, knowing 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these things to be true, it is well 
that we ask the question that Pres- 
ident Joseph F. Smith asked himself 
and the Latter-day Saints this morn- 
ing, What have I done; what am I 
doing, what am I willing to do, to 
help establish this great work? 

Proclaiming to the world that 
God has revealed to us all the prin - 
ciples of the Gospel, the great 
things that have been hidden from 
the foundation of the world, and 
has delivered to us the responsibil- 
ity of teaching them to our fellow 
men, it is well that we ask that 
question in all seriousness. Am 
I willing to do what my father 
or my grandfather did ? Am I will- 
ing to do what the first men and 
women who received this Gospei did 
for the establishment of the work 
of God in the earth? Is my all on 
the altar, am I willing to spend 
my time, my means, and my tal- 
ents in that great cause? I say, 
my brethren and sisters, it is a 
good question to ask ourselves. 
May God help us to appreciate the 
fact that we are the only people 
who have this divine right to offici- 
ate in the name of God. May He 
help us to exercise this authority 
with an eye single to the glory 
of God, in all charity and love, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

Brother Ellsworth stated that 79 
years ago, day after tomorrow, this 
church was organized, with six 
members. Rather a small begin- 
ning; but it was predicted by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith that it would 
continue to grow until it filled the 
whole earth with the righteousness 



of God. What a wonderful thing 
has been done among churches 
during the past 79 years. Mor- 
monism, as it is called by the peo- 
ple of the world, has found iLs 
way into every civilized nation. As 
Brother Goddard stated, there is 
not a nation upon ttie earth where 
the voice of the children of God 
cannot be heard, saying, "Come, let 
us go up to the mountain of the 
Lord, to the house of the God 
of Jacob." They want to come 
here for the purpose of learning 
more of the wavs of the Lord, and 
to walk in the paths that will bring 
them back into the presence of our 
Father. There is not a civilized na- 
tion where our elders are not work- 
ing, where we do not find mem- 
bers of the Church 

The work that is being done by 
the missionaries today is a mani- 
festation of devotion to the prin- 
ciple of reciprocity. We are doing 
for other what others have done 
for us and for our parents. Re- 
cently, in the New England States, 
I had the privilege of holding a 
priesthood meeting with thirty- 
eight Elders, 37 of whom were 
born in the Church. The fathers 
of 15 of whom were born in the 
Church, and the grandfathers of 
31 were members of the Church. 
In another conference wnere we 
had 12 Elders, 10 of whom were 
born in the Church, the fathers 
of 6 were born in the Church, and 
the grandfathers of 9 belonged to 
the Church. Still another confer- 
ence in which there are 14 Elders, 
9 of the 14 were born in the Church, 
the fathers of 7 were born in the 
Church, and the grand-fathers of 
9 were members of the Ch' rch. 
So you see the second and third 
generations are out in the world 
preaching the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. God sends His spirit be- 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



45 



fore them. It softens the hearts 
of mankind toward the Elders. 
While we properly think that our 
fathers and grand-fathers have 
been mighty men in the interests 
of the gospel, I tell you there are 
just as good fish left in the sea as 
have been drawn out with the Gos- 
pel net. This work will go on, 
and intellectual giants will be 
brought into the Church. The 
leaven has started to work, and it 
will leaven the whole lump eventu- 
ally; it has been developing during 
the last 79 years. 

You do not hear so much of 
"hell-fire-and-brimstone" as was 
preached before God sent the truth 
down to earth. There are not so 
many people believing that there 
are infants in hell only a span long. 
Churches all over the world are 
becoming converted to Gospel prin- 
ciples which God the Eternal Fath- 
er restored to earth through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. It is true 
^1 — are not giving the Church 
credit, but they are adopting the 
doctrine. It is making them broad- 
er minded. It is making them bet- 
ter; and it is leading them nearer 
to the truth. Speaking to you this 
afternoon, as a representative from 
the missionary field, I want to tell 
you that your sons, your fathers, 
your husbands, who are out in the 
world preaching the gospel are do- 
ing more for humanity, more for 
the peonle of this world, than you 
can estimate. God is blessing them. 
And the students who go out into 
the world to study are doing ex- 
cellent work. Those who are labor- 
ing in New York are helping us 
in a wonderful way. They are 
teaching the Elders to sing. They 
take charge of the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations, and the Sunday 
school. They are ready to preach 
the gospel whenever called upon to 



do it, the same as the Elders who 
are called specially to devote all 
their time in lifting up their voices, 
crying, "Repent ye, for the king- 
dom of heaven is at hand." Many 
of you people remember Robert C. 
Easton, who has such a wonderful 
voice. You have not seen him for 
years ; but the talent that God has 
given to that man is employed in 
missionary work at all times; and 
strangers who come into our meet- 
ings and hear him sing, especially 
that famous hymn, "O, my Father, 
Thou that dwellest," shed tears. 
There is nothing better than good 
music to soften the hearts of peo- 
ple, and bring them into a condition 
that they will patiently listen to the 
words the Elders have to speak un- 
to them. 

Mormonism grows, because it is 
God's truth. It was prophesied, al- 
most from the beginning, that in 
the last days God would do a mar- 
velous work and a wonder upon the 
earth. He showed in vision to the 
Prophet Daniel that he intended to 
set up a kingdom upon the earth in 
the last days; that it would stand 
forever, and never more be thrown 
down. The very language con- 
veys to us the knowledge that God 
has set up His work in other dis- 
pensations, and it has been thrown 
down ; but He has shown that in 
the last days, the God of heaven 
would establish a kingdom upon 
the earth that never more would 
be thrown down or given to anoth- 
er people. What kind of an organ- 
ization would that be? Would it 
be with apostles and prophets, evan- 
gelists, priests, and teachers, in- 
spired of God, standing upon the 
rock of revelation, preaching the 
Gospel without purse or scrip, an- 
swering the question, "What shall 
we do to be saved?" in the same 
way that Peter of old answered it 



43 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon the day of Pentecost? Would 
it be like unto that? Why. I im- 
agine so; I know it would. We are 
told that an angel should come 
through the midst of heaven, bring- 
ing it to the earth. The Gospel 
that Christ left with mankind was 
an organization like this we possess. 
The fundamental principles of that 
Gospel were faith in God and 
Christ, His Son, repentance — a 
godly repentance — baptism by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins, 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost by 
laying on of hands. You know, by 
reading the Word of God that those 
were the principles of the. organi- 
zation, — and that which God has 
given unto us is an organization 
which includes them. You know 
also that, referring to the Gospel, 
when Paul ascertained that the peo- 
ple in one of the branches of the 
Church down in Galatia were try- 
ing to change it, he wrote them a 
strong letter in which he warned 
them against perverting the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and told them 
that any man would be cursed if 
he changed it ; that the curse of God 
would even rest upon an angel 
from heaven if he should proclaim 
any other. So that, when the angel 
comes through the midst of heaven, 
bringing the everlasting Gospel, it 
must be like unto the one that Jesus 
Christ left with the people, or the 
curse of God would rest upon that 
angel. We are told by Peter that 
no prophecy of the Scripture is of 
any private interpretation, that men 
of God wrote and spoke as they 
were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, so that the kingdom of God 
that was to be set up on the earth 
in the last days, as shown to Dan- 
iel, and as brought by the angel 
shown to Tohn, must be the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, just the same as 
that He left upon the earth. Mor- 



monism is primitive Christianity, the 
"Everlasting" Gospel, the "Eter- 
nal" Gospel, because it is the plan 
of salvation established by the Ever- 
lasting and the Eternal One. There 
cannot be two different churches 
and both of them be right. "One 
Lord, one faith, one baptism, was 
the doctrine taught in the days of 
the early Apostles, nearly two thou- 
sand years ago. Anything more 
than that creates confusion; and it 
is written that God is not the au- 
thor of confusion. If He is not the 
author of confusion, then He is not 
the author of all that goes to make 
up this Babel of confusion in the 
religious world today. Something 
is wrong. 

The most startling thing about 
this work is that from the begin- 
ning of its organization, with six 
members, authority was given to 
go out to preach the gospel, to say 
unto all mankind, There is knowl- 
edge for you, there is a testimony 
for you, if you will come in the 
right way to receive it. Humble 
yourselves. Put your faith in God. 
Repent with a godly repentance. Be 
baptized under the authority that 
we say has been restored to the 
earth. Receive the seal of the 
spirit ; and we are authorized to 
say, in the name of Christ our 
Master, that God will bestow upon 
you a testimony of the truth. And 
how well that has been made good ; 
father, son and grandson have re- 
ceived it; and they are out in the 
world, in all the nations of the 
earth, crying unto people every- 
where: We have received a testi- 
mony ; and God will give it to you 
if you seek in the same way that we 
have sought. Why, of course it 
is true: it is easy enough to know 
that it is true. 

I heard President Taylor upon 
one occasion relating a conversa- 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



47 



tion that took place between two 
little boys. One of them said, 
"Johnny, do you know my papa?" 
And Johnny said, "No, I do not 
know your papa." the other said, 
"I know him, just as easy." It is 
just as easy as that to know that 
Mormonism is true. If you tread 
the path, if you obey the principles, 
if you humble yourselves before 
God the Eternal Father, he will 
give you a testimony that this is 
His work, that it has been brought 
to the earth by an angel, delivering 
to mankind a record of nations who 
once jived upon this continent, one 
of which was visited by Christ 
Himself, who taught them of 
His resurrection, and taught them 
the everlasing Gospel. You will 
find it in that book (the Book of 
Mormon.) It came through the 
midst of heaven by an angel, and 
he thus brought the everlasting Gos- 
pel back to earth. Read it with a 
prayerful heart, and the spirit of 
God will whisper to you, "This 
record is true." The doctrine is 
true, and it will be easy for you to 
have a testimony of the truth. 

A man told me when I was 
speaking in the world once that I 
might just as well tell him that 
the moon was made of green cheese 
as to tell him that Mormonism was 
true. I said to him: "My friend, 
supposing that I did tell you that 
the moon was made of green cheese, 
and tell you that I had been there 
and tasted it, and you knew that I 
had been there and tasted it, and I 
wanted you to taste it, and you had 
the privilege of so doing, but ab- 
solutely refused to walk up and 
take a bite, would you be in a posi- 
tion to truthfully contradict me?" 
And he said, "No." I said, "Well 
I want to tell you that I have tasted 
Mormonism, and I know what it is, 
but there are some steps to be tak- 



en, the first is called faith, the sec- 
ond repentance, the third baptism, 
the fourth is the receiving of the 
seal of the Spirit. Climb that lad- 
der and taste Mormonism; I have 
tasted it, and if you will do so, you 
will know that it is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. If you stand there 
with folded hands and refuse, have 
you a right to contradict me when I 
tell you in the name of Jesus Christ 
that this is the Gospel of the Re- 
deemer sent back to the earth to 
lead mankind back into the pres- 
ence of our Father?" God bless 
you. Amen. 

(Toward the conclusion of the 
services, Elder Rich made the fol- 
lowing comments.) 

Brother Goddard has asked me to 
read to you the words of President 
Roosevelt that he spoke in May, 
1903, in the Tabernacle, about our 
people subduing this country. He 
said : 

"Here, in this state the pioneers and 
those who came after them took, not 
the land that was ordinarily chosen, 
as a land that will yield return with 
a little effort. You took a state which, 
at the outset, was called after the 
desert, and you literally, not figurative- 
ly — literally made the wilderness to 
blossom as the rose. The fundamen- 
tal element in building up Utah has 
been the work of the citizens of Utah; 
and you did it because your people 
entered in to possess the land and to 
leave it after them to their children 
.and their children's children." 

I want to say to you that this 
people never had a better friend in 
the White House than Theodore 
Roosevelt. There has never been 
a man there that understood this 
people as he understood them. He 
has been, and he is your friend. 
Many a conversation have I had 
with him concerning the struggles 
of this people, and the building up 
of this land with the aid of our

fathers. We are now enjoying what 
our fathers gave their lives to ac- 
complish. You are enjoying com- 
fortable homes that the early found- 
ers of this Church gave every- 
thing in order that their children 
and their children's children might 
inherit. 

Read the hymn written by Wil- 
liam Clayton. Just before the Pio- 
neers came, before they started 
from Council Bluffs, President 
Young called him and said, "Bro- 
ther Clayton, I want you to write 
a hymn that these pioneers may 
sing as we travel into the unknown 
west." In two hours' time, Wil- 
liam Clayton had written, set to 
music, and sung, to President 
Young that famous hymn, "Come, 
come ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, But with joy wend your way." 
Read that hymn, and then think 
what your fathers and grandfathers 
passed through that you might en- 
joy the comforts of life that are 
yours today then, be determined to 
maintain the same faith and deter- 
mination! thkt they possessed, to 
give your lives, if necessary, that 
the Gospel may go to others who 
have not yet listened to the sound 
of it. Be prepared to go at a 
moment's notice, if you are wanted, 
into any part of the world, and 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Here is another hymn just is- 
sued, "The Hymn of the Pioneers," 
by Sister Kate Thomas, and I am 
going to read you one or two of the 
verses. Notice therein the spirit of 
the pioneers, our forefathers who 
risked their lives, our mothers, who 
had faith in their husbands and in 
the leaders of the Church, that God 
would show to them the place 
where He intended the prophecy 
uttered by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, should be fulfilled, in which 
he declared that the people would 



eventually be established in the val- 
leys of the Rocky mountains, and 
build great cities. 

"Courage, my soul ! all is not bar- 
ren plain. 
What tho' the way be long and 
strewed with dead; 
His word is sure, who knoweth 

all thy pain, 
• Lift up thine eyes, His heaven 

is overhead. 
Praise God ! praise God ! 

His Sun broke through the night. 
On — on — press on — 

His love is all His might. 

"Praise God, my soul ! My children 

reap the seed 
Sowed by my faith and watered 

by my tears. 
God of the nations, God of every 

creed, 

Let them be just to what my 
soul reveres! 
Praise God ! praise God ! 

Omnipotent love! 
On — on — press on — 

Till all the world is love!" 

The hymn, "I know that my Re- 
deemer lives," was sung as a solo 
by Elder Melvin J. Ballard. 

ELDER JOHN G. M'QTTARRIE. 

(Late President of Eastern States 
Mission). 

About eighty-nine years ago, a 
young man, possessing that child- 
like faith that knows no doubt, as 
the result of an earnest, humble 
prayer, received a visit from the 
Father and the Son. The first 
question that he was privileged to 
ask was, "Which of all the denom- 
inations or churches is right?" This 
was a boy only 14 years of age ; 
but whether men are old or young, 



ELDER JOHN G. McQUARRIE. 



49 



whether they are learned or un- 
learned, they must each ask this 
very important question, when they 
have a desire to be reconciled to 
God, or to find the true philosophy 
of life. And those who are not 
asking themselves this question 
have not ceased to do so because of 
the simplicity, but rather because 
of the complexity of the question. 
There may be some who are not 
asking the question, "Which of all 
the denominations is right," but if 
they are not, they are trying to 
find for themselves, or carve for 
themselves, a path through the 
forest of theory, a road through the 
desert of doubt, without a chart or 
compass, or without ecclesiastical 
leadership. Without some know- 
ledge from a divine source, it would 
be impossible for any one from the 
various philosophies of life to de- 
termine, and be able to answer this 
question. There are some who are 
susceptible to the impression of the 
Spirit, some who know and feel the 
truth through intuition, inspiration, 
and revelation. There are others, 
like Thomas, who need to have 
some lines of reason so tangible that 
they can be led up to the door of 
knowledge that they may knock in 
order to have it opened unto them. 
It is probably for the guidance of 
this class of people that the Mas- 
ter said, "Bv their fruits you shall 
know them," and that the Apostle 
Paul said, "Whatsoever you plant, 
that shall you also reap." Hence 
we know, from these two unques- 
tioned authorities, that there is a 
natural law prevailing in the 
spiritual world, that our salvation 
comes as natural as corn grows; 
th^t character grows just as other 
products tnav grow, in harmony 
with natural law. 

But which of these two rules 
are you going to apply to deter- 



mine what you shall do? With- 
out doubt, the test of every , flower 
or plant, or blooming tree, is even- 
tually in the fruit that it bears. 
But the farmer, in order to be even 
ordinarily successful, must be able 
to determine long before the fruit 
is ripened, yes, before the flower 
has bloomed, and even before the 
tiny shoot has broken through the 
soil, he must be able to determine 
what the harvest shall be. So, too, 
in our lives we may be able to 
judge something by the fruit, but 
if we wait until the fruit is going 
to ripen in our own lives, it is too 
late then to change the harvest so 
far as you and I are concerned. We 
want to know the kind of seed we 
are going to plant. 

When it comes to a test of the 
various seed stores, the various 
agricultural departments, etc., it is 
not in the catalogues, it is not in 
the pictures they paint, but it is in 
the seed that they furnish. So. 
too, in the various churches, it 
is not the virtues they proclaim that 
you can judge by. It is in the seed 
of eternal truth that they are able 
to implant; and I feel certain, my 
friends, that if you will get down 
to these seed truths and then apply 
your reason and see what the result 
will be, you can determine fairlv 
well what the frui f of any system 
may he. Some of these truths 
have been referred to by President 
Rich. They have stopped planting 
some of the old errors that have 
heretofore been planted in the 
hearts of men. Before leav- 
ing this analogy I would 
like to make this remark 
upon it: There is no man in this 
congregation but kr^ows a good 
peach or a good apple when he 
sees it. But why don't all gather 
good apples and peaches ? It is be- 
cause you are too lazy to get the 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



right kind of seed to plant; you 
do not get the right kind of trees 
to put into the soil ; you do not pre- 
pare the soil as you should. You 
know what a good horse looks like ; 
why don't you have good horses? 
You are too careless to get the 
right kind of stock to start with ; 
you do not have the right kind of 
horses. So too, in examining the 
various churches. They go into 
this church and hear a fine sermon 
upon virtue, and say, "Anyone can 
believe that, that is true. They 
preached virtue before Christ, and 
from the days of Adam down to 
the present. Every man knows 
virtue." But, it is to get the seed 
that will produce it. I venture to 
say that, you can go into a com- 
munity where every man and 
woman is a drunkard and preach 
that drunkenness is better than 
temperance, and you will be run 
out of that place. Stand up in a 
place where vice abounds, and 
preach that vice is better than vir- 
tue, and you would be howled 
down, because, instinctively, men 
seem to know what virtue is, even 
when they have lost it. 

Although they have preached 
charity for hundreds and thousands 
of years, yet we have not practiced 
charity. And why is it? It is be- 
cause the right kind of seeds have 
not been planted. We can talk 
about charity. You can talk about 
the age of the brotherhood of man. 
But that age will never come until 
it is preceded by that inherent be- 
lief that there is a real relationship 
existing between us. One of the 
greatest ministers of the age 
preached a sermon some time ago 
in New York City. It was called 
the greatest sermon that has ever 
been preached on the island, since 
the time it was bought from the 
Indians for about $25 worth of 



trinkets; and it is in harmony 
with what Brother Rich testified to 
you. He said "How long have 
we heard the old slogan of 'miser- 
able sinners,' 'depraved wretches,' 
'created things!' But if you ever 
get anything great out of men, you 
must make them believe that there is 
something great in them ; and if you 
make them believe they are just 
'created things,' 'miserable wretch- 
es,' 'everlasting sinners,' waiting an 
eternal and everlasting torment and 
damnation, you will never get any- 
thing great out of them. If I 
had a boy that was going to 
be a chimney-sweep, I would 
want to make him feel that he 
was good enough to sweep out 
Vesuvius." He then related anec- 
dotes and stories of the power that 
belief had over the actions of men, 
and then he said: "We cannot too 
strongly insist upon the idea that 
we are in reality the sons of God; 
that we are not 'created things,' 
but that we are begotten spirits. 
If you make a man feel that he is 
a tramp, he will be a tramp. If 
you make him feel that he is a king, 
he will be a king. Make him feel 
that in reality he is a son of God 
and he will strive to be like his 
Father." Humanity is much alike 
the world over, and whatever seed 
of thought is planted, it is bound 
to crop out into action. In the age 
when they believed, in eternal tor- 
ment, when they thought that a 
man was a heretic when he differed 
from others in belief, that the Lord, 
the great Creator, was just waiting 
until he passed the portals of death 
to plunge men into an eternal pun- 
ishment, they thought, of course, 
thev were only doing a little of 
God's service in administering a 
little of this punishment before the- 
went over there, and to give them 
a warning. It was not their nat- 



ELDER JOHN G. McQUARRIE. 



51 



ural meanness, it was only a nat- 
ural product of the seed that was 
planted. Can you see the dif- 
ference between a truth and an 
error implanted in the mind? One 
that you are simply a "created 
thing ;" the other, the idea that you 
are a begotten spirit. That one 
great revelation is working a re- 
formation throughout the world, 
the eternal truth is being implant- 
ed in the hearts of men, that God 
is an eternal being, that He is 
actually the father of our spirits. 
Following out that idea, we grad- 
ually come to feel that if God is 
our Father, Christ is really our 
elder brother, and we are all 
brethren, and sisters, Until men feel 
this, they will never act like it, be- 
cause where there is no relation- 
ship understood, there will be no 
obligation acknowledged, and 
where there is no obligation ac- 
knowledged, there will be no con- 
science, because conscience is the 
obligation that we feel one toward 
another. Regardless of creeds, re- 
gardless of dogma, regardless, per- 
haps, of revelation we feel instinc- 
tively a kind of relationship to each 
other. But just to the degree that 
the idea is hazy or uncertain in 
the minds of men, just to that de- 
gree will our actions be selfish and 
insincere. You can test it. Sup- 
pose you meet a man, he is, per- 
haps, in prison, he has no way of 
helping himself. If he happens to 
be your own brother, you give the 
last dollar to help him out of 
trouble, because you feel that he is 
a part of yourself. Suppose that 
he is your cousin, you say: "let 
his brother help him," You do not 
feel much obligation. Suppose he 
is your forty-second cousin, do you 
feel the same obligation? You 
will feel that he is your brother 
only to that extent that you will 



acknowledge the relationship. 
There is very little conscience be- 
tween the white man of Europe 
and the yellow man of Asia ; there 
is no relationship acknowledged 
between them. There was no con- 
science between the black man of 
the south; and his white owner, 
because there was no relationship 
acknowledged between them. And 
just to the degree that this idea, 
this great, grand truth, revealed 
through the modern Prophet, be- 
comes generally tondlerstood, and 
fully felt, to that degree will we 
come nearer to this age of the bro- 
therhood of man. 

Suppose that instead of preach- 
ing, instead of believing in eternal 
punishment, that God's anger en- 
dures forever, you implant in the 
hearts of man that God's mercy 
endures forever, that you implant 
in their minds the idea that Christ 
designs to save the whole world, 
that whether men are recreant in 
this world or not, whether they 
come to Christ here or not, whe- 
ther they have had an opportunity 
to hear him or not, that, though 
they may suffer for the sins they 
have committed, infinite punish- 
ment will not be permitted for a 
finite sin; when they have faith in 
Jesus Christ, when they have com- 
plied with these conditions, when 
they repent of their sins, when they 
turn toward God, that His mercy 
will be extended to them. Why, 
you never could treat a man that 
did not happen to believe or see 
as you do, as you would treat him 
if you believed that. Supposing 
that one principle had been im- 
planted in the minds of men in 
the early days, do you think there 
would ever have been an inquisi- 
tion? Do you think thev would 
have invented those terrible tor- 
ment machines in order to punish 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men ? No. Their hearts " would 
have been full of charity, full of 
toleration. 

If men always had believed in 
continuous revelation, if children 
had been taught in their Sunday 
schools, "We believe all that God 
has revealed, all that He does now 
reveal, and we believe that He will 
yet reveal many great and impor- 
tant things pertaining to the king- 
dom of God," do you think the 
Christian would have wanted to 
kill the Mohommedan simply be- 
cause the Mohammedan brought 
the truths that he had in competi- 
tion, as they thought, with the 
truths of the Bible? Mormonism 
is prepared to receive every man's 
truth, to receive all revelation that 
God may send through whatever 
channels He may use, and through 
every window light may shine into 
this darkened chamber of humanity 
in which we live. Truth does not 
conflict with truth. 

You know that men have been 
preaching; charity throughout all 
the ages. Was the Christian ever 
charitable to the Jew? No, the 
Pharaohs of Egypt, the Czars of 
Russia, the Kings of Assyria, the 
godless inquisitors of Europe all 
united to exterminate that race of 
people. But when the Gospel was 
restored, one of the first things 
the prophet did was to send men 
to Jerusalem. To see what they 
would pillage and rob and take 
from them? No, he sent the men 
to bless the land, and dedicate it 
that the Jew might again have a 
home and a nation; and we feel 
kindly toward the Jew. Why? 
Because we can feel our relation- 
ship to him ; and we pray for the 
dav when the Lord will remember 
His promises to them, and that they 
may turn and repent of their ways. 
The Indian too, how was he treat- 



ed by the Christians even of this 
Christian nation? They thought 
it almost as lawful to hunt and 
kill Indians as buffalos ; but when 
the priesthood was restored, and 
this Book of Mormon was given 
to us, we learned that we played 
with the Indians in the tents of 
Jacob. Our fore-fathers played to- 
gether around the tents of the old 
Israelities, and we again feel 
friendly toward the Indian. Brig- 
ham Young said, "It is cheaper to 
feed them than to fight them," You 
will never see a Latter-day Saint 
who understands that record that 
would kill an Indian. I believe 
that one of our people would rath- 
er kill a white man, because he 
feels he is more his equal, than the 
Indian in his weakened condition. 
What causes that difference of at- 
titude? It is not because we are 
different people; it is because of 
the seeds of truth that are spring- 
ing up in our souls and bearing the 
harvest of charity, and toleration, 
and fellowship. 

Mormonism has a message of 
love and peace to all the world, to 
the Jew, and to the Gentile, to 
the Indian and to the heathen, and 
whether they are high or low, we 
feel that relationship to them. If 
they are weak, they need our help, 
if thev are high, we only rejoice 
in it. And we owe this fruit of 
charity to the seeds of Gospel 
truths that have been implanted 
in our souls. Unless men have 
that knowledge of one supreme 
God, unless they do know their re- 
lationship, they cannot possibly 
know their relationship to each 
other, and without knowing their 
relationship to each other, without 
feeling- that relationship, that bro- 
therhood, the age of the brother- 
hood of man never could come 
about; but by feeling it, by really 



SISTER LILLIAN V. IONES.

believing it, it never could be staid. 
If we can convert man to it, until 
right down in their souls they be- 
lieve and feel that one eternal 
truth, then the success of the world, 
the triumph! of righteousness, is 
secured. I hope that, as Latter- 
day Saints, we will appreciate this 
heritage of truth that has been 
given to us, and that we who have 
enlisted under the standard of 
righteousness will glorify the cause, 
and continue to fight under that 
flag until righteousness shall 
triumph, until the kingdoms of this 
world shall become the kingdoms 
of our God, whose right it is to 
reign. 

I bear my testimony to you, 
my brerthen and sisters and friends, 
that I do know that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the living God, and that 
the Gospel had been restored to the 
earth in this day and age of the 
world. As President Joseph F. 
Smith said this morning, and as 
Brother Ellsworth testified, all of 
you who are under the sound of 
my voice can receive 'this same 
testimony, by applying the princi- 
ples of the Gospel to your lives. 

I ask God's blessings upon you 
all, that He may seal upon your 
minds the truths that you have 
heard in this conference, and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



Prof. Elihu Call sang the favor- 
ite hvmn, "O my Father, Thou that 
dwellest." 

SISTER LILLIAN V. JONES. 

(Of the Southern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My dear brothers and sisters, I 
sincerely trust that I may have the 
Spirit of the Lord while I address 



this congregation, to guide and di- 
rect me in what I may say, that it 
may be for our mutual benefit and 
blessing. As has been announced I 
have labored in the Southern 
States Mission for nearly a year 
and a half, under the direction of 
President Ben E. Rich, and Pres- 
ident Charles A Callis. I can say 
that while I labored as a missionary 
there I truly enjoyed every mo- 
ment of the time. My Only regret is 
that I was released from my labors 
there, although my release was 
merely a transfer from one field to 
another. I consider that I was 
greatly privileged, to go into the 
world and mingle my voice with the 
sisters and elders in the field, in 
testimony of the truth of the gos- 
pel as taught by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Of course we met a great deal of 
opposition; we expected that, but 
we also had the chance of bearing 
our testimonies to hundreds and 
thousands of people, and also pro- 
claiming some of the truths and 
beauties of Mormonism to them. 
I have often wished that more of 
our girls and boys had the chance 
of going into the world and preach- 
ing the gospel. They not only 
benefit themselves, but "lay up 
treasures in heaven, where moth 
nor rust corrupt or thieves break 
through and steal." I feel thank- 
ful to my heavenly Father for this 
opportunity; and I hope that the 
gospel seed I have sown will some 
day bear fruit and be the means of 
bringing many people into the 
Church of Jesus Christ. 

I have sought the honor that 
comes from God rather than the 
honor that comes from man, and I 
feel that in doing so, my mission 
has been approved of God, and I 
have been of some benefit to oth- 
ers.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I feel to bear my testimony to 
you that the Gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation. I pray that 
the Spirit of the Lord may rest 
upon each and every one of us, 
and especially upon the President 
of the Church and his counselors, 
and the quorum of the Apostles. I 
ask these blessings in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

The question has often been ask- 
ed each of us, perhaps, and it 
came to me recently in corres- 
pondence that I had with a friend 
belonging to the re-organized 
church : "Why is it that the Latter- 
day Saints came to Utah? Why 
didn't they remain in the east 
where they first were founded, and 
began the establishment of their 
organization?" There are many 
reasons that can be given in answer 
to this question, some of which I 
desire to call briefly to your at- 
tention. Suppose that the Latter- 
day Saints had been permitted to 
remain in the city of Nauvoo; the 
prospects were then that they 
would have built up and established 
one of the largfest cities in the 
United States. When Nauvoo had 
20,000 people, Chicago on the 
north, and St. Louis on the south 
were mere trading posts. Nauvoo 
occupied a favorable position, 
where, in all probability, with its 
water-ways, its central location be- 
tween the north and south extrem- 
ities of Illinois, it would have been 
an eligible point for the building 
up and establishment of a large 
city. Suppose that Nauvoo had 
been built up to become the equal 
of the city of St. Louis on the south 



with 800,00 or more, inhabitants 
the probabilities are that all the 
Latter-day Saints would not have 
resided in that one city, as they 
do not now belong to one partic- 
ular locality. When they lived in 
that section, they were scattered 
over a large area of country. It is 
apparent that God had in mind tak- 
ing this people from a thickly set- 
tled portion of the country, a coun- 
try that did not require much en- 
ergy or effort to develop. The 
Divine idea was to take them away 
from crowded centers, and have 
them locate where they could be as 
"a city set upon a hill," so that 
their light could be seen and their 
works be made manifest. Here, 
where no one else cared to live, 
where men said there was no op- 
portunity to establish civilization, 
their feet were planted; and they 
remained here, although there was 
California on the west with its 
great enticements for the Saints to 
go and settle there. You remem- 
ber that Captain Brannon, who 
landed in California shortly before 
the Saints located in this valley 
met the pioneers east of this valley, 
and invited them to come to Cali- 
fornia, telling the wonderful ad- 
vantages of that climate and soil, 
where it would be possible to build 
up great communities quickly, and 
where the people could enjoy the 
blessings of that fertile land. 

In anticipation of the movement 
that would transfer all the Saints 
to the west, the Prophet Joseph 
thought of Oregon, the great land 
to thie northwest, as a desirable 
place to go; this was his first 
thought. Oregon would have fur- 
nished more opportunities, larger 
advantages in a commercial way, 
for the Latter-day Saints, or any 
others, in its fruitful fields, its ex- 
tensive valleys, and with its splen-

did facilities to build up cities. But. 
if the Latter-day Saints had gone 
there, or to California, they would 
soon have been face to face with 
their old enemies, who were follow- 
ing them. They would soon have 
been outnumbered; and whatever 
would have been done in the build- 
ing up of that community, the cred- 
it would have been given to other 
people. But this forbidding coun- 
try, where no other people were 
willing to locate, was the chosen 
resting place. You remember, 
when the women of that party land- 
ed on the banks of City Creek, one 
of the weary women sat down and 
wept, and said she would rather go 
a thousand miles further, notwith- 
standing the hardships she had 
gone through, to find a more desir- 
able place than this barren desert 
land. Yet this was the place, for 
the prophet had said that here, in 
vision, .he had seen the tents of 
Israel cover the earth. The peo- 
ple remained here, notwithstanding 
the enticements offered in Califor- 
nia, with its gold and the many ad- 
vantages . that, seemingly, would 
have come to them there in a com- 
mercial and financial way. Thou- 
sands of the immigrants did not 
look with favor upon this place, be- 
cause it evidently would require 
great labor to develop it, to bring 
out of this sterile condition a fruit- 
ful field. But God planted His 
people here, and through faith, la- 
bor and diligence, and industry, 
they have attracted the attention of 
the world. 

It is only a few years ago that 
the President of the United States 
visited this city, and, speaking of 
the wonderful achievements and 
developments which had come to 
this barren section of the country, 
said something to this effect: You 
have become prominent in the 



world in material things, in the de- 
velopment of the soil ; all the world 
can come here and learn of you ; 
learn that by industry, thrift and 
perseverance, wonderful achieve- 
ments have been accomplished in 
this desert land, results also of 
fidelity and frugality. It is prob- 
able there never would have been 
such praise accorded to the Latter- 
day Saints, they never would have 
had the opportunity to develop 
themselves in this direction, or have 
merited the praise of the world in 
these things, had they gone to a 
land that would have yielded re- 
turns more easily to their effort 
and toil. The work has been done 
well, by men and women of virtue 
and strength, driven by enemies to 
settle here and battle with the ele- 
ments, to subdue this desert land. 
They have made of it a paradise, 
and assuredly merit in honor, and 
right, and truth the praise of the 
world. , 

But beyiond these temporal 
things, beyond these achievements, 
there is something greater to be ac- 
complished, a labor to be perform- 
ed, that should attract the attention 
of the world beyond our material 
things, that should call for their 
further admiration and praise. I 
refer to that which we value be- 
yond all earthly things, the es- 
tablishment of the Church and 
Kingdom of God, and the procla- 
mation of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. That is what the 
world needs today more than any- 
thing else, that which will bring 
most joy to their souls. The day 
shall come when the good, and the 
great, and the wise men and wo- 
men of all the world shall say. 
"Come, let us go up to the Moun- 
tain of the house of the God of 
Jacob, that we may learn of His 
ways and walk in His paths." They

may learn not only of material 
things, but great and mighty truths 
that tell of man's being, his ex- 
istence upon the earth, his relation- 
ship to his Creator, the purpose 
God had in placing us here; and 
so the world shall yet acknowledge 
that we know things of value be- 
yond all earthly possessions. 

I feel, as a young man born and 
raised in this Church, having the 
opportunities and privileges that 
come by reason of my association 
in it, like Benjamin Disraeli did 
when he made efforts to obtain 
membership in the house of Par- 
liament in Great Britain. Three 
times he made the effort and failed 
in accomplishing what he desired; 
but he persevered, though he un- 
derstood well that he hlad the 
hatred and prejudice of the masses 
of the people against him, on ac- 
count of his religion and his race. 
But he finally succeeded in ac- 
complishing the desired end. He 
obtained the seat, and many of his 
friends, relying upon the ability of 
the man to defend himself and the 
cause of his people, said, as soon" 
as he was heard, he would ac- 
complish great things. But when 
he had the opportunity to stand be- 
fore that great body of law makers, 
and endeavored to speak, his voice 
was silenced by hisses, and noise, 
and disturbance in that assembly. 
He repeated his efforts, and each 
time was silenced, but, as he sat 
down, he cried out at the top of 
his voice, "The day shall come 
when you will hear me." With 
that determination, he stuck to his 
task, working to accomplish the 
fulfillment of his prophecy concern- 
ing himself; and the time did come 
when thev gave him the exalted 
honor of being prime minister of 
England three times. England's 
lords and statesmen often listened 



to his wise words, no matter how 
many hours he spoke. And so I 
feel that, though there are those 
who have attempted to blacken our 
character, who despise us, and seek 
to make us outcasts, yet the time 
of our triumph shall come, because 
of the honest effort, the integrity, 
the virtue and moral strength of 
the young men and young women 
of this Church. We have resolved 
in our hearts, as Benjamin Disraeli 
did, never to cease our efforts, nor 
to slacken our endeavors to make 
the world hear us, until ignorance, 
and prejudice, and hatred shall be 
banished from the earth, and the 
love of God, and a knowledge of 
the truth of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, shall find its way into the 
hearts and homes of the millions 
who know nothing of us this day. 

We stand in a most enviable posi- 
tion in the world. Our mission is 
not only to benefit ourselves in these 
valleys, but our mission extends to 
the east, west, north and south ; all 
the world is our field. God sent 
us to labor in His vineyard. He 
called us here to train us to be 
teachers to the nations of the earth, 
not only to attain blessings and 
honor ourselves, but to bestow the 
same on them also. May God keep 
before us the high ideals that our 
fathers had, preserve us in the 
truth, as He preserved them, that 
when we finish our labors on the 
earth, we may merit the honor and 
praise which they have merited ; 
God grant it, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

Mr. Ferris' anti-Mormon book re- 
viewed. — Glaring mis-statments re- 
futed in relation to Book of Mor- 
mon. — Striking evidences that Amer- 
ican Indians are Hebraic. — Irrefut- 
able reasons for belief in Book of 
Mormon. 

My brethren and sisters : — I de- 
sire very greatly that your sym- 
pathy and faith may be exercised 
in my behalf, during the few mo- 
ments I shall occupy this afternoon. 

Tn his remarks this morning, 
President Smith said, among other 
things of which we approve, that 
the principles of the Gospel of 
Christ were founded upon ever- 
lasting truth. While he was talk- 
ing, I thought of an experience 
which recently came under my ob- 
servation, in fact, one which I had 
personally while at the City of 
Mexico. ' In connection with this 



matter, I want to read from the 
Bible: "Lying lips are an abom- 
ination to the Lord, but they that 
deal truly are His delight." 

I went into a book store in the 
City of Mexico, a few weeks ago, 
and saw there upon the shelves a 
took entitled, "Utah and the Mor- 
mons." I bought the book and read 
it. It was written by a man who 
had been a resident of this state, 
a scholarly man, undoubtedly, and 
one who professed to have become 
intimately acquainted with his sub- 
ject through association with the 
Latter-day Saints. The book con- 
tained some things which were 
complimentary to the people, but 
upon almost every page there were 
misrepresentations, falsehoods, and 
statements which could not be sup- 
ported by facts. It seemed to me 
that nothing more outrageous, more 
abominable, or farther from the 
truth could possibly have been writ- 
ten than the things which were 
contained in that book; and yet a 
larg-e edition of it, had been printed 
and circulated in the world. This 
man took particular pains to at- 
tack the doctrines of the Church. 
He misquoted the teachings of pre- 
siding officers in the Church. He 
misrepresented social conditions as 
they exist or ever have existed in 
the Church. He took particular de- 
light in assailing ^he Book of Mor- 
mon, which he called a delusion, 
and claimed that Solomon Soauld- 
ing was its real author, notwith- 
standing the fact it is a well known 
truth that that story has long since 
been exploded. When I read it, 
I thought — how dangerous are ly- 
ina: lios, and what ' trouble, what 
misunderstanding may come to in- 
dividuals or people through a lying 
pen. 

I shall not attempt, my brethren 
and sisters, to point out to you the 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



many inaccuracies which were in 
this book; iime would not permit. 
But, to illustrate the thought that 
I had as I read it, I am going to 
quote to you, this afternoon, a part 
of what this man said regarding 
the Book of Mormon. 

"There is probably no book in the 
world which contains within itself so 
many proofs of its real origin, and 
one is struck with wonder that the 
imposture should have fastened itself 
upon such numbers. A portion of the 
Israelites are alleged to have found 
their way to America, and they and 
their descendants wrote a long book 
in which there is not one word of the 
Hebrew language. In addition to this, 
not a single word of Hebrew, nor a 
Hebrew character can be found in the 
language of these descendants of Israel 
upon the American continent." 

We must assume that men who 
write books, men who make his- 
tory, are familiar with the subjects 
which they treat. They at least 
ought to be, and when the facilities 
are at their command, so that by 
simply investigating they may 
know the truth, they certainly are 
left without excuse if they publish 
to the world that which is not true. 

In the first place, this man pur- 
ported to be thoroughly acquainted 
with the Book of Mormon, to have 
read and studied it, and yet he tells 
us that it is a book written in 
Hebrew characters, by people who 
are supposed to have come from 
Jerusalem. Nephi, in the very be- 
ginning of the Book of Mormon, 
tells us he wrote that record ac- 
cording to his knowledge, in the 
learning of his fathers, which he 
says is the learning of the Jews and 
the language of the Egyptians. 
Moroni, the last writer in it, says: 

"Now behold, we have written this 
record in characters which are called 
among us the reformed Egyptian, and 
if our plates had been sufficiently 



large, we should have written in He- 
brew; and if we could have written in 
Hebrew, there would have been no er- 
ror in our record." 

So the Book of Mormon was 
not written in the Hebrew language 
as this publisher tells us; but, ac- 
cording to the testimony of the 
men who made the record, it was 
written in characters which were 
called among them "reformed 
Egyptian." That people coming 
from Jerusalem should have been 
conversant with the Egyptian lan- 
guage, and familiar with the civ- 
ilization of Egypt, is not at all 
strange. You all know that for four 
hundred years Israel was captive in 
Egypt, or they sojourned there for 
that period of time, during a part 
of which they were in captivity to 
the Egyptians. They were the mak- 
ers of their bricks ; the builders of 
their temples, their pyramids, and 
other great edifices. They acquir- 
ed the learning of the Egyptians, 
and when they went into the prom- 
ised land, led by Joshua, the pro- 
phet of the Lord, they took with 
them the Egyptian language and 
civilization; and they tell us that 
they wrote this book in characters 
called among them the reformed 
Egyptian. So Mr. Ferris is in er- 
ror in that regard. Suppose, how- 
ever, that the book had been writ- 
ten in Hebrew characters — I want 
to show you how unjustified the 
statement of this man is, that not a 
trace of the Hebrew language could 
be found among the different dia- 
lects and tongues spoken by the 
Aimerican Indians. 

Garcia, the Spanish historian 
and ethnologist,one who studied the 
archaeology of America probably 
as thoroughly as any of the writ- 
ers, says in referring to this ques- 
tion: 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



59 



"Similarity in character, dress, relig- 
ion physical peculiarities, conditions, 
and customs convince me that the 
Americans are of Jewish origin. There 
do actually exist many Hebraic traces 
in the American languages." 

So this man finds that in the 
languages of the natives of this 
continent there are many traces of 
the Hebrew. Lord Kingsborough, 
who probably wrote more exhaus- 
tively on this subject than did any 
other historian, says, "The Indian 
dialects have much in common with 
the Hebrew," and Adair says : 

"The Indian language and dialects 
appear to have the very idiom and 
genius of the Hebrew. Their words 
and sentences are expressive, concise, 
emphatic, sonorous and bold; and of- 
ten, both in letters and in signification, 
are synonymous with the Hebrew lan- 
guage." 

My brethren and sisters, I call 
attention to these facts, not being 
able, because of lack of time, to 
go into detail as one might in a 
thorough investigation of this ques- 
tion, to show you how unjustified 
a man is who publishes to the world 
the statement that this Book of 
Mormon contains no internal evi- 
dence of its divine authenticity, to 
show you that men who have in- 
vestigated this question, almost 
without exception, reach the con- 
clusion that there is a very strong 
affinity and similarity, which leads 
investigators to the conclusion — 
many of them to the definite con- 
clusion — that the present inhabi- 
tants of the American continent, 
that is the natives of the country, 
were of Jewish origin. 

Hubert Howe Bancroft, the great 
historian, tells us that he him- 
self saw a tablet of stone taken 
from a mound which was opened 
in the State of Ohio. Under this 



mound, imbeded in a clay having 
the characteristics of cement, a cof- 
fin was found, containing the skel- 
eton of a man; and underneath the 
coffin, hermetically sealed, in a box 
made of stone and fastened to- 
gether with cement, there was a 
small tablet of stone, upon which 
the figure of a man was engraven. 
Over his head, and on the sides of 
the tablet there were peculiar 
hieroglyphics. The historian tells 
us that these hieroglyphics, were 
pronounced by one of professed 
learning to be the Ten Command- 
ments, written in Hebrew char- 
acters. This is very conclusive 
evidence that the ancient inhabi- 
tants of this continent knew some- 
thing of the Hebrew. That they 
understood something of the civili- 
zation of Egypt there can be no 
doubt. Any person who has traveled 
irij the southern part of North Am- 
erica, who has visited those ruined 
cities, great temples, and tremend- 
ous works of masonry which exist 
there today can bear witness. Only 
a few days ago, I stood upon the 
top of a pyramid, out a few miles 
from the City of Mexico, the base 
of which occupies a space larger 
than this entire city block, more 
than ten acres square, solid mas- 
onry, more than three hundred feet 
high, built square with the world. 
All around it as far as the eye can 
reach, are mounds of the remains 
of ruined homes. A great city once 
existed there. Who were the build- 
ers of the pyramid There were none 
in ancient Chaldea. No pyramids 
were built by the Assyrians. What- 
ever civilization there was among 
the Jaredites was the civilization 
of Chaldea and Assyria, those early 
races which settled jn the valley of 
Mesopotamia, along the banks of 
the Tigris and Euphrates. But later, 
Israel went into Egypt. There they 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



learned something of pyramid 
building. There are pyramids 
standing today in the valley of the 
Nile, almost as perfect as the day 
of their construction. I thought 
of them, the other day, as I stood 
on the top of this great pyramid 
down in the interior of Mexico. 

Jones, the historian, who has 
studied exhaustively the ruins of 
Central America and Yucatan, 
says : 

"The general character of the 
American architecture is undoubt- 
edly Egyptian." — Now listen to 
what he says further — "but the 
resemblance is not close enough in 
detail to allovy of its being actual- 
ly the work of Egyptian hands." 
He concludes that it could not have 
been built by Egyptians themselves. 
"The ancient cities of America 
were, therefore, built by a people 
who had a knowledge of Egyptian 
architecture." 

How beautifully this harmonizes 
with the truths set forth in this holy 
book, that these cities were the 
work of descendants of the house 
of Israel, the same people who had 
been the builders, to a very large 
extent, of the cities and monuments 
which exist today in the valley of 
the Nile. 

Further in justification of this, 
Professor Le Plongeon, who has 
recently died, in New York, spent 
fifteen years of his life in Yucatan 
exploring ruined pities, studying 
the language of the people, at- 
tempting to decipher the inscrip- 
tions which abound upon the walls 
of those great temples. He tells 
us, after these years of exploration, 
study and investigation: 

"The ancient Maya hieratic alphabet 
discovered by me, is as near like to the 
ancient hieratic alphabet of the Egyp- 
tians as two alphabets can possibly 



be; forcing upon us the conclusion 
that the Mayas and Egyptians either 
learned the art of writing from the 
same masters, or that the Egyptians 
learned it from the Mayas." 

Professor Le Plongeon rejects 
the story told in the Bookj of Mor- 
mon. He does not acknowledge 
the fact that the builders of these 
great monuments were descendants 
of Lehi or other remnants of the 
house of Israel who came from 
Jerusalem, bringing with them as 
they did the learning of the Jews 
and the civilization of the Egyp- 
tians ; but, nevertheless, he states 
facts which convincingly substan- 
tiate and corroborate the truths con- 
tained 'in the Book of Mormon. 
There are so many things which 
might be said upon this subject. 
The book itself stands before the 
world, and has been subject to its 
criticism from the time of its pub- 
lication. The Spaulding story has 
been exploded, and so with other 
theories that have been advanced 
against it. At the time this book 
was published, it was not known 
that there was any conclusive proof 
indicating the Hebraic origin of the 
Indians of America. The declara- 
tions made in this book, that great 
cities were built, that temples were 
erected, that a great civilization ex- 
isted here — which was comparative- 
ly unknown at the time the book 
was published — are corroborative 
of its truth. 

This same historian, Jones, in 
examining the ruins of the city of 
Palenque, compares the architec- 
ture of one of these great build- 
ings to the architecture of Solo- 
mon's temple. Neohi tells us that 
they built a temple similar to the 
temple of Solomon, in all thing's 
except that it was not so richlv 
adorned. They had not the gold 
and silver and the precious stones, 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



61 



but they did have the plan ; they did 
have the idea. This historian tells 
us that in the basement of one of 
these great buildings he found a 
reservoir which was undoubtedly 
designed to catch and hold water. 
Knowing nothing of the purpose 
for which water might be used in 
the basement of a temple, and 
knowing nothing of the ordinance 
of baptism, or the conveniences 
which are provided for its admin- 
istration, he nevertheless corrobor- 
ates the faith and knowledge of the 
Saints, by these modern discover- 
ies. 

The book itself and the internal 
evidences which it contains are suf- 
ficient to establish its truth. I am 
not referringto these facts so much 
to strengthen your faith and mine, 
as I am to bring into question the 
right of any man, to discuss things 
which he does not understand, to 
publish untruths. He can not ex- 
cuse himself because of lack of 
knowledge. Men are not expected 
to discuss things of which they are 
ignorant, when the facts are easily 
obtainable. So, I believe that the 
Lord will hold us responsible, I 
believe that He will hold all men 
responsible for the things they say 
that are untrue. One thought that 
came to me, as I read this book, 
was that I myself ought to be very 
careful how I judge the faith, how 
I judge the doctrine, how I judge 
the lives of other people until I 
become thoroughly acquainted with 
them. I believe this man thought 
the Book of Mormon was a delu- 
sion, just as he said it was. I be- 
lieve he thought it was, hut I do not 
believe that he ever took the pains 
to find out whether it was a delu- 
sion or whether it was true ; this he 
micht have done. 

You know that if the divine au- 
thenticity of the Book of Mormon 



can be successfully attacked, it 
strikes at one of the very founda- 
tion stones of the Church — not that 
the Book of Mormon was absolute- 
ly essential, not that the delivery of 
these plates to the Prophet Jos- 
eph, and their translation into the 
English language and publication 
to the world, were sufficient au- 
thority for him to have established 
the Church of Christ upon the 
earth. We could have done with- 
out that. The first glorious visions 
which the Lord gave him were not 
authority sufficient for the es- 
tablishment of Christ's church in 
the earth ; that authority came later 
with the restoration of the priest- 
hood ; but they were all preliminary 
and preparatory moves which were 
necessary in the great plan of hu- 
man redemption which the Lord 
was about to establish in this dis- 
pensation. So He gave us the 
Book of Mormon, containing the 
fullness of the everlasting Gospel, 
in its plainness, simplicity and 
truth. The Prophet Joseph Smith 
did not undertake to establish the 
divine authenticity of this book by 
reference to the evidences which 
exist in this continent, by which it 
may be corroborated — not at all. 
He gave; us the book as a truth ; it 
was a truth that God revealed these 
things to him ; it was a truth that 
Moroni delivered the plates into 
his hands ; it was a truth that this 
book was translated by the gift and 
power of God, through the medium 
of the Urim and Thummim. Now, 
we spend a good deal of time try- 
ing to determine how that was 
brought about. What does it mat- 
ter how it was brought about? It 
was done bv the gift and power of 
God, that is sufficient for me. It 
was done by means of the Urim and 
Thummim — not a new method 
either of learning the will of the 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord, for the ancients had it. The 
High Priests in Israel had it, and 
with it they ascertained the mind 
and will of the Lord for the guid- 
ance of the people ; just as with it 
the Prophet Joseph was able to 
translate this record, and to re- 
ceive the mind and will of the 
Lord, the covenants, doctrines and 
commandments, by which the 
Church was to be guided, as they 
are contained here in the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants. It is the 
truth, the everlasting truth. Noth- 
ing in the world will ever prove it 
to be false. Men may try to prove 
if false, but they never will succeed. 

Brethren and sisters, I bear this 
witness to you : There is a world of 
corroborative evidence of the di- 
vine authenticity of this Book of 
Mormon — read it ; study it ; be gov- 
erned by the doctrines that are 
taught in it. Have faith* in it ; be- 
lieve in the promises that are con- 
tained in it, and you will find in- 
spiration and hope, faith and char- 
ity, and everything that is good in 
human life. It stands for that 
which is good, for that which is 
true, for that whichis just, for that 
which is merciful, for that which 
uplifts, and places before us higher 
ideals to which we constantly as- 
pire. May we always appreciate the 
word of truth. Remember, my 
brethren and sisters, that the law of 
God is truth. The Church of 
Christ is established upon the prin- 
ciples of truth and righteousness, 
and therefore truth and righteous- 
ness should be constantly cultivated 
and encouraged in the Church and 
out of it. We need to be taught 
the principle of truth, because we 
are not always, perhaps, truthful. 
A man may be untruthful in other 
things than what he says ; he may 
be untruthful in what he does; he 
may be untruthful in the impres- 



sions which, he seeks to make. 
Every misrepresentation of a fact is 
an untruth. 

I rejoice in the Gospel, and I 
pray our Eternal Father that He 
may continue to magnify the 
Church as He has done, that He 
will open the way for the accom- 
plishment of His purposes, to bring 
about the redemption of His coven- 
ant people, and the day when His 
kingdom shall come and His will 
be done upon earth as it is in 
heaven. I pray for these blessings 
— I desire them for my self, for 
you, and for all the world, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

be in harmony with His will. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in 
the testimonies that have been 
borne during the sessions of this 
conference. I was deeply im- 
pressed this morning, with the 
magnitude of the work as it was 
set before us by President Smith. 
I was impressed, too, with Presi- 
dent Lund's remarks. One of his 
sentences, I will repeat. "Every 
one of us," said he, " should feel 
that he must do something for the 
upbuilding of the kingdom of God, 
whether it be at home or abroad." 
When President Lund expressed 
that sentiment, I thought — that the 
great mission of this Church is to

build up — never to tear down. In 
the Book of Mormon, 17th chapter 
of First Nephi, there is recorded 
an incident that I wish to read. The 
little colony has only recently left 
Jerusalem ; they have obtained the 
records; they have left the valley 
of Lemuel; and are near the sea 
shore. The historian says: 

"And we did come to the land which 
we called Bountiful, because of its 
much fruit, and also wild honey; and 
all these things were prepared of the 
Lord, that we might not perish. And 
we beheld the sea, which we called 
Irreantum, which being interpreted, is 
many waters. 

"And it came to pass that we did 
pitch out tents by the sea-shore and 
notwithstanding we had suffered many 
afflictions and much difficulty, yea, ev- 
en so much that we cannot write them 
all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when 
we came to the sea-shore ;and we 
called the place Bountiful, because of 
its much fruit. 

"And it came to pass that after I, 
Nephi, had been in the land of Bounti- 
ful for the space of many days, the 
voice of the Lord came unto me, say- 
in. Arise, and get thee into the moun- 
tain. And it came to pass that I arose 
and went up into the mountain, and 
cried unto the Lord. 

'And it came to pass that the Lord 
spake unto me saying, Thou shalt con- 
struct a ship, after the manner which 
I shall shew thee, that I may carry 
thy people across these waters. 

"And I said, Lord, whither shall I 
go that I may find ore to molten, that 
I may make tools to construct the 
ship after the manner which thou hast 
shewn unto me? 

"And the Lord told me whither I 
should go to find ore, that I might 
make tools; and I did make a bellows 
wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins 
of beasts; and after I had made a bel- 
lows, that I might have wherewith to 
blow the fire, I did smite two stones 
together, that I might make fire; for 
the Lord had not hitherto suffered that 
we should make much fire," * * * 

"And it came to pass that I did 
make tools of the ore which I did mol- 
ten out of the rock. 

"And when my brethren saw that I 



was about to build a ship, they began 
to murmur against me, saying, Our 
brother is a fool, for he thinketh that 
he can build a ship; yea, and he also 
thinketh that he can cross these great 
waters. 

"And thus my brethren did complain 
against me, and were desirous that 
they might not labor, for they did 
not believe that I could build a ship; 
neither would they believe that I was 
instructed of the Lord. 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
was exceeding sorrowful because of 
the hardness of their hearts; and now 
when they saw that I began to be sor- 
rowful, they were glad in their hearts, 
insomuch that they did rejoice over me, 
saying, We knew that ye could not con- 
struct a ship, for we knew that ye were 
lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou 
canst not accomplish so great a work ; 

"And thou art like unto our father, 
led away by the foolish imaginations of 
his heart ; yea, he hath led us out of the 
land of Jerusalem, and we have wan- 
dered in the wilderness for these many 
years; and our women have toiled, and 
borne children in the wilderness and 
suffered all things, save it were death; 
and it would have been better that they 
had died before they came out of Jerusa- 
lem, than to have suffered these afflic- 
tions. 

"Behold, these many years we have 
suffered in the wilderness, which time 
we might have enjoyed our posessions, 
and the land of our inheritance; yea, 
and we might have been happy. Thus 
they continued to murmur against the 
voice of God, as expressed through His 
servant Nephi." 

In this little family we find the 
two classes into which all mankind 
may be divided — the builders and 
the murmurers, or as Emerson apt- 
ly expresses it, "the benefactors and 
the malefactors. The second class 
is vast; the first, but a handful. 
Why, a person seldom falls sick but 
the bystanders become animated 
with a faint hope that he will die." 

From its inception the Church 
has belonged to the class of ben- 
efactors. The members of this 
Church have been builders, but all

the wfiile they have had to contend 
with the class of malefactors, the 
murmurers against God and 
against His word as delivered to 
the world through His servants. 
Never have the leaders of the 
Church been guilty of tearing down 
and making miserable other people. 
They have preached the Gospel. 
They have built the house of 
truth, and let the world compare 
its magnificence with the houses in 
which the world were living. Many 
thousands have left their houses of 
adobe and have come into the man- 
sion of the Gospel, because they 
saw that it was better. But the 
Church does not tear down the 
houses of others, before erecting 
one that is more commodious and 
more beautiful, in the Church of 
Christ. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith was 
told that the churches of his day 
had a form of godliness but denied 
the power thereof, and he was told 
to wait, and God would establish 
His Church. Several years elapsed, 
years of preparation, and soon the 
Prophet, under the guidance and 
insolation of the Lord, establish- 
ed the Church of Christ. They met 
in a h'ttle room — it was just a little 
cottage meeting. The Eastern 
States Mission alone held, last 
year, over twelve Hundred such 
me°tings not one, perhaps, num- 
bering so few in attendance as the 
Ht+1e pothering when the Church 
of Christ was re-established, on 
the fth-day of April, 1830. But a 
mighty work was being builded; 
and those whp engaged in that 
work were impressed with the fact 
that their mission was to save, that 
henceforth they were to build up- 
on the rock of truth. In a revela- 
tion following that, the Prophet 
sent the Elders out to preach the 



Gospel; and these are the words 
of the Lord, through him : 

"And ye shall go forth baptizing 
with water; saying: Repent ye, repent 
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand; and from this place (Kirtland) 
ye shall go forth into the regions west- 
ward, and inasmuch as ye shall find 
them that will receive you, ye shall 
build up my church in every region, 
until the time shall come when it shall 
be revealed, unto you from on high, 
when the city of the New Jerusalem 
shall be prepared, that ye may be 
gathered in, that ye may be my people 
and I will be your God." 

They went forth preaching the 
Gospel of salvation, comparing its 
principles and truths with the prin- 
ciples taught by men, emphasizing 
the doctrines of the Church, but 
leaving men to judge for them- 
selves whether the message they 
gave was true and therefore for 
the good of humanity, or whether 
it was evil. Through the inspira- 
tion of God, thousands recognized 
the saving principles taught by 
those humble Elders. Hundreds 
gathered, soon thousands, and they 
began to build up the Church. Fol- 
low them from Kirtland. through 
the state of Missouri. Read the 
early history of the Church, as we 
were admonished this moraine, and 
see how the barren places of the 
west — for it was western country 
then — were made fruitful ; how 
cities sprang up where there had 
been nothing but desolation. Fol- 
low them from those homes, as 
they were driven by the bayonet. 
See them camping in a marsh in 
Illinois, and there, in a miracul- 
ously short time, build the city of 
Nauvoo, the pride of the west. 
Builders ? Yes — benefactors to 
humanity. Aside from their doc- 
trines — the doctrines of Christ, ab- 
solutely proved from the Scrip- 
tures — take the people as citizens. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

as men mingling- with fellow men, 
and you find them benefactors in 
every sense of the word. But not- 
withstanding their good works, not 
many years passed before they 
were again without homes — their 
farms unattended, the grain going 
back to the ground because there 
were no harvesters ; the walks lead- 
ing to their houses becoming grass- 
grown, because no feet were there 
to tread them ; the hearth cold, be- 
cause no hands were there to light 
the fire. Where were they? Again 
in the wilderness of the west; one 
thousands miles ahead of them 
nothing but buffalo. Indians, bar- 
renness, sterility. When I recently 
visited Omaha, being a few miles 
from Florence, I was forcibly re- 
minded of the early experiences of 
our parents at that place, and at 
Des Moines, Iowa, then on the 
frontier. I have heard them tell 
how they prepared their teams, 
hitching up a cow with an ox, 
sometimes a cow with a horse, 
making ready to take that thou- 
sand mile journey; where? Out in- 
to the barrenness, out into the 
wilderness, and yet still into the 
country, under the flag of the 
Union. What was their purpose? 
What was the motive? As a prom- 
inent educator in Chicago said, 
the other day : "Not, for the golden 
California, but that they might 
worship God Almighty according 
to t 1n e dictates of their conscience ; 
and I admire them for it." Such 
was their motive — to build the 
Church and to save the principles 
revealed to man. They had risk- 
ed all ; they had risked life and 
everything they had, and were will- 
ing to endure any hardship — 
wives walked every step of the way 
on this long journey; mothers car- 
rying their babes. On the 24th of 
July, 1847, they were here in this 



valley. What did they see? You 
try to picture what they saw. These 
words will call up the barren 
picture in the minds of pioneers 
who are with us today — God bless 
them and preserve them long with 
us for what they have done, that 
we might at least express our ap- 
preciation of their devotion to the 
truth. They saw sagebrush ; they 
heard the howl of the coyote ; they 
saw in the distance the smoke of 
the Indian fire ; and the salt sea in 
the west reflecting the beautiful 
sunlight; but there was no appar- 
ent place for a home. There was 
nothing here inviting; in fact, they 
had been warned that nothing 
would grow; a thousand dollars 
had been offered for the first ear 
of corn that they would .produce. 
Yet, within a few feet of where we 
meet today, the Prophet of the 
Lord said, "Here we shall build a 
house to God." Now what do we 
see? Just look at our citv today; 
its climate modified; its fruit un- 
excelled; substantial and comfort- 
able homes everywhere; towns and 
cities flourishing. To whom are 
we indebted for all this? The peo- 
ple of the Mormon Church, the 
pioneers of 1847, and subsequent 
years. They were builders, colon- 
izers, benefactors to our nation, 
benefactors to humanity. Did they 
tear down anything? Did they 
destroy? Did they find fault? No. 
They (protected themselves, with 
a motive that they might continue 
to bless. 

It is not alone as colonizers that 
the Church has made its record; 
not alone as community builders 
but as home builders. Compare 
the teachings — no, not just the 
teachings; for it is not every one 
that sayeth, but he that doeth, that 
shall enter the kingdom of God. 
It isn't enough to say that we be- 



66

lieve in home-building and in the 
purity of the home. What are we 
doing? Go into the homes of true 
Latter-day Saints, and there see if 
the most substantial part of the na- 
tion — the home — is not the best 
that can be found. The family tie 
is an eternal one; it is not one of 
experiment; it is not one of sat- 
isfying passion; it is an eternal 
union between husband and wife; 
between parents and children. That 
eternal bond is one that must be 
held sacred by the man as well as 
by the woman. Is it a source of 
safety? Is it a blessing to human- 
ity to have such homes? The saf- 
ety of our nation depends upon the 
purity and strength of the home; 
and I thank God for the teachings 
of the Mormon Church in rela- 
tion to home building, and the im- 
pression that kind parents have 
made, that the home must be the 
most sacred place in the world. 
Our people are home-builders, and 
they are taught everywhere, from 
childhood to old age, that the 
home should be kept pure and safe 
from the evils of the world; and 
yet the murmurers, the malefac- 
tors are ready to question, even 
deny the purity of the Mormon 
home. "The motive was impure," 
they say, "you come out here for 
other purposes." They are mur- 
murers ; and the class is vast, who 
take that stand and attack the 
home. Only recentlv, in the town 
of Mitchell, South Dakota, a rev- 
erend brother, who was supposed 
to teach the word of God to the 
people, published a statement in 
the daily papers, that the Elders, 
your sons, are out there to under- 
mine the homes of the people in 
Mitchell. Is he a benefactor or a 
murmurer, a builder or a tearer 
down ? No doubt he does it through 
ignorance. Men become murmur- 



ers or fighters against this Church, 
for one of two reasons; either 
through sin — for sin hates truth 
and virtue — or through ignorance. 
There are many people in the 
world who condemn us because 
they are ignorant of the real facts 
concerning the Church of Christ. 
The great comfort to us, however, 
is that we know the purpose of 
the Church ; we know its history — 
a little of it ; not, however, so much 
as we should know, we younger 
people. We ought to study it more. 
There is inspiration in the history 
of this Church. There is inspir- 
ation and truth in reading the do- 
ings of the Prophet Joseph and 
those associated with him in the 
early days. Read it; study it; do 
not censure because of ignorance. 
When we read the history of the 
Church, we are forced to acknowl- 
edge the fact that it has blessed 
humanity. When we study the 
principles, we find that they are 
the saving principles, as revealed 
by the Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. What more do we want? 
There is nothing done, there is 
nothing taught, under the guidance 
and inspiration of the Lord but 
tends to the upbuilding and ad- 
vancement of the human race, and 
that tends to the amelioration of 
the evils that afflict humanity. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
as in the world so in the Church, 
we have two classes; we have the 
builders, and we have the murmur- 
ers. Let each ask himself in 
which class shall I be placed? We 
are called upon to perform duties. 
High Councilors with Presidents 
of Stakes are asked to go forth 
and build up their stakes and do 
other work in the Church. They 
introduce some plan of action, and 
many times the majority will say: 
Yes. we will do that; let us go to 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



67 



and perform the duties that the 
Presidency of the stake and the 
High Councilors call us to do. But 
somewhere we shall hear a mur- 
murer, a fault-finder, who will say, 
no; you cannot do that. They 
scoff as Laman and Lemuel did ; 
and say you can not do it. Mis- 
judging motives, some soon find 
themselves with Laman and Lem- 
uel, instead of with Nephi who 
expresses the voice of God. It may 
be in an auxiliary board. Instruc- 
tions go out from the general board 
or from the stake board, requiring 
for the success of the movement 
the united energy of all. Most of 
the people interested in that as- 
sociation will join hands to build, 
they will join hands to be with 
the benefactors, that the children 
might receive the light of the Holy 
Spirit, that they might get the 
knowledge that is revealed in this 
Church ; but somewhere there will 
be murmurers; there will be fault- 
finders. Look out for them. 

Let us watch ourselves and be 
true to the examples set by the 
Church and the brethren and sis- 
ters who have sacrificed their lives, 
their all, to build the Church and 
to advance the principles taught 
therein. This warning is some- 
times expressed in this way: 
"Speak not against the authori- 
ties." What does it mean. Be not 
a murmurer ; that is what it means. 
It is one of the most poisonous 
things that can be introduced into 
the home of a Latter-day Saint — 
this murmuring against presidents 
of stakes, high councilors, Sunday 
school superintendents,presidents of 
high-priests' quorums, seventies, 
elders, priests, teachers and dea- 
cons. They are called unto their 
position, what for? To benefit 
themselves? No, not once can you 
point to an instance in this Church 



where a man was called for his 
personal benefit. He was admon- 
ished, before he was called to the 
position, whatever it was, that he 
should serve somewhere and serve 
somebody in this Church or in the 
world; it was to bless somebody, 
some class, humanity at large. That 
is the mission of every man, from 
the president of the Church down 
to the latest convert in the Church. 
Every officer holds his position 
to build up, to bless ; and, as Presi- 
dent Smith said this morning, to es- 
tablish righteousness, purity and 
virtue among mankind. That is the 
motive, and yet because of his 
weakness, because, perhaps, of some 
little fault that we see in an of- 
ficer, we begin to murmur and 
find fault. Better stop murmuring, 
and build up. Remember that one 
of the worst means of tearing down 
an individual is slander. It is one 
of the most poisonous weapons that 
the evil one uses. Backbiting and 
evil speaking, throw us into the 
class of malefactors rather than the 
class of benefactors. 

"Good name in man or woman, 
dear my lord, 
Is the immediate jewel of their souls; 
who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis 

something, nothing; 
'Twas mine, 'tis his and has been 

slave to thousands; 
But he that filches from me my good 
name 

Robs me of that which not enriches 
him 

And makes me poor indeed." 

In this connection, speaking of 
the Church as a whole, I have 
often thought that we have chosen 
the wiser part in answering a fac- 
tion that left the Church in early 
days, inasmuch as we did not 
choose to tear them down or to at- 
tack them in public or private. 
They call themselves the Reorgan- 
ized Church. As I listened to one 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



who has come out here presum- 
ably to teach the truth, and heard 
him revile and ridicule President 
Young and other leading brethren 
of the Church, I felt to say, what 
good does it do to tear down ? Why 
not build up? Tell us about what 
you have, and let the people then 
judge which is the better; it is 
much the wiser course. When a 
man begins to tear down, revile 
and persecute, he is doing that 
which injures instead of building 
up. Our mission should be to 
build. 

But you ask, would you not 
condemn evil? Yes, by obeying and 
building up the laws of right. The 
question in building is this : Is it 
right? Is that thing necessary to 
be done? If so, then let us do it. 
God revealed to Nephi the neces- 
sity of building a ship. "The means 
were not within his 'reach, but he 
felt it was right to build, and with 
that knowledge he proceeded to 
find the way to make the tools and 
to build the ship. Did he make 
mi? takes? Did he falter? No doubt, 
— else why did his murmuring bro- 
thers sny: "We told you you could 
not build a ship; we knew you did 
not have the wisdom." But he 
knew he was right, and he knew 
that God would strengthen him in 
building. That thought held him; 
it suoported him ; and he succeeded 
in the task before him. So it is 
with us; when we are asked to do 
a tbinof, the question in our minds 
should be : Is that necessary ; is 
that right? If so, then it shall be 
done, and God will open the way. 

I et us build up our state ; let us 
build uo our homes, improve them, 
make them attractive and pleasing, 
that the world may see by our lives 
that we are here to benefit in every 
way, not only by preaching the 
word of God, not only by sacrific- 



ing what we may be called upon 
to sacrifice, but by building com- 
munities, cities — a nation, if neces- 
sary; and above all by building 
character, after the order of the 
servants of God; nay, after the 
similitude and pattern of the Lord 
and Savior Himself. That is our 
ideal; that is what we wish. God 
help us, as brethren and sisters, to 
go forth on our mission of mercy 
to bless humanity, being filled with 
charity for one another, that our 
hearts may be full of love for each 
other; with confidence in each oth- 
er, in our associations, in our socie- 
ties. 

Members in the Aaronic priest- 
hood, and members of the quorums 
in the Melchizedek priesthood, we 
have a duty to build up our quor- 
ums; let us not tear them down 
by being absent from Monday 
night meeting, or by non-prepara- 
tion, or by negligence of duty. Let 
us feel, every one of us, as sug- 
gested this morning, that it is our 
duty to do something to build up 
the Church, as the Church's duty 
is to build on truth and redeem 
mankind from sin. Men of the 
priesthood, let us be one in this up- 
building; let us fall into the class 
of benefactors; and let no man, 
from the high priest to the deacon, 
in this great priesthood movement 
of Monday night, fall into the class 
of malefactors or murmurers. God 
help us to do our duty, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

When Brother Ivans mentioned 
the book that he found in Mexico, 
I thought of the introductory 
words of a book entitled "The 
Great Salt Lake Trail," written by 
Col. William F. Cody, more f,amil- 



/ 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 69 



ilarly known to us as "Buffalo Bill" 
and by his companion Colonel 
Henry Inman. They say: 

"Over this historical highway, the 
Mormons made their lonely Hegira to 
the valley of that vast inland sea. On 
its shores they established a city mar- 
velous in its inception and a monu- 
ment to the ability of men to over- 
come almost insuperable obstacles, the 
product of a faith equal to that which 
inspired the Crusader to battle to the 
death for the possession of the Holy 
Sepulcher. * * * * An immense 
mass of literature on the subject (Mor- 
monism) is to be found in every pub- 
lic library both in its defense and in its 
condemnation. The latter preponder- 
ates and often seems to be inspired by 
an inexcusable ingenuity in exagger- 
ation." 

It has been a source of satisfac- 
tion to know that some people have 
fairly examined the question of 
Mormonism, and, in a measure, 
have done justice to this great peo- 
ple and to this important cause. 
One of these writers we recall in 
the person of Josiah Quincy, that 
polished Bostonian, once Mayor of 
Boston, a graduate of Harvard, and 
a man chosen by his alma mater 
to welcome Lafayette upon his sec- 
ond visit to this country. ■ Josiah 
Quincy visited the Prophet at Nau- 
voo, a short time before the martyr- 
dom, and his impressions of the 
Prophet are certainly of value. 
Most all of you will recall the 
thought that he expressed in refer- 
ence to the Prophet Joseph and this 
great work ; said he : 

"It is by no means improbable that 
some future text book, for the use of 
generations yet unborn, will contain a 
question something like this: 'What 
historical American of the nineteenth 
century has exerted the most power- 
ful influence upon the destines of his 
countrymen?' And it is by no means 
impossible that the answer to that in- 
terrogatory may be thus written: Jos- 
eph Smith, the Mormon prophet. And 



the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems 
to most men now living, may be an 
obvious commonplace to their descen- 
dants. History deals in surprises and 
paradoxes quite as startling as this. 
The man who established a religion in 
this age of free debate, who was and is 
today accepted by hundreds of thou- 
sands as a direct emissary from the 
Most High — such a rare individual is 
not to be disoosed of by pelting his 
memory with unsavory epithets." 

Mr. Quincy goes on to say that 
the Prophet Joseph can not be dis- 
posed of by calling him a fanatic, — 
that fanatics and imposters are liv- 
ing and dying every day, and their 
memory is buried .with them ; that 
Joseph Smith was a phenomenon 
yet to be explained. He speaks of 
the impression that "resource and 
capacity — were natural to his 
stalwart person," that one would 
instinctively say, in meeting him, 
that he was a fine looking man ; 
and he compares him in strength of 
character and that kingly faculty 
that directs others as if by intrinsic 
right, with one individual only that 
it had been his pleasure to meet — 
and you will remember that Josiah 
Quincy was on terms of intimate as- 
sociation with some of the earlier 
presidents of the United States, and 
many of the early New England 
statesmen: He writes his reminis- 
cences of those great men from a 
personal acquaintance with them, 
and yet he says that of all his ac- 
quaintances there was only one oth- 
er individual that impressed him as 
did the Prophet Joseph Smith, for 
this rugged power, and kingly fac- 
ulty. He also speaks of the atti- 
tude of the Prophet in reference 
to the question that later so vexed 
this nation and caused such streams 
of blood, and the loss of so many 
hundreds of thousands of lives and 
millions of treasure. He compares 
the words of the Prophet on that 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



subject, to those of the retired 
statesman Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
in advocating the policy of using 
the revenues from the public lands 
of the United States in order to 
purchase the slaves and to free 
them when purchased. Josiah 
Quincy comments upon this matter 
by saying that if the retired New 
England statesman was entitled to 
be called a statesman for advocat- 
ing that plan in 1855, when the 
war-clouds were lowering, and 
men's minds were agitated with 
the slavery question, then certain- 
ly the Prophet Joseph Smith is en- 
titled to credit for "advocating the 
same policy eleven years previous to 
that time both in oral and in writ- 
ten speech. He concludes his words 
by saying that if the reader is un- 
able to determine what to make of 
Joseph Smith, that he is unable to 
assist him, that he himself stands 
helpless before the puzzle or the 
phenomenon. But, give him cred- 
it for being the Prophet of God, 
which he was, and there is no phen- 
omenon to explain. The whole 
question is clear and apparent at 
once, if you give him credit for 
being what hundreds of thousands 
of Latter-day Saints today testify 
that be was — a prophet of the liv- 
ing God. 

Ah English traveler, writing at 
about the same time that Josiah 
Quincy visited Nauvoo, in com 1 - 
menting upon his impression of the 
Prophet and his patriarch brother, 
said that in beholding them he 
thought he had beheld two of the 
greatest men of the 19th century. 
We have also the words of a con- 
gressman who met the Prophet 
at tbe time he visited Washington 
in behalf of his people, with ref- 
erence to the wrongs suffered by 
them during the days of Missouri. 
This congressman heard the Pro- 



phet speak, and writing of his re- 
marks, he said that he was im- 
pressed with his sincerity. Said he: 
"There was no levity, no fanati- 
cism, no want of dignity in his de- 
portment. Throughout his whole 
address he displayed strongly a 
spirit of charity and forbearance." 

I am sure the Latter-day Saints 
all take pleasure in the account 
given by the distinguished English 
journalist, Mr. Phil Robinson, in 
his work entitled, "Sinners and 
Saints," written after he had trav- 
eled from one end of this state to 
the other, becoming acquainted 
with the people in their home life, 
realizing and testifying that there 
was virtue and worth in this thing 
called "Mormonism." 

Recently, comparatively speak- 
ing, we have had the words of Mr. 
Elbert Hubbard, in reference to 
some of the leaders of Mormonism. 
He speaks of the great work of 
Brigham Young — that he saw with 
the eye of the prophet the barren, 
sterile fields converted into fruitful 
gardens; that "he had the brain of 
a prophet and the soul of a seer." 
That "he was the first man in Am- 
erica to- put irrigation on a scien- 
tific basis," making it possible to 
convert the sterile plains into pro- 
ductive fields. As I remember it, 
Mr. Hubbard commences his ac- 
count of Mormonism by saying 
that he thinks if he ever joins a 
Christian church, he will join the 
Mormons ; that the Mormons be- 
lieve in the Old and New Testa- 
ments, and in the Book of Mormon. 
He states that he. too, believes in 
all three and in addition to that, he . 
facetiously adds, the bound volumes 
of his own publications. He says, 
how any individual can believe that 
God handed down tablets of stone 
in ancient times, and will then denv 
that Joseph Smith had the plates of 



ELDER CHALRES H. HART.

gold, is something more than he 
can understand; that it is simply a 
difference in time and place, that 
the principle involved is the same. 
He speaks also of the work of edu- 
cation upon the part of a certain in- 
dividual, living in a city that I shall 
not name, as I shall not name the 
individual, whose life is given over 
to reviling the Mormon people. He 
concludes with the statement that if 
you would ask a terrapin its opin- 
ion of an eagle, it would be as 
much as the opinion of this writer 
in regard to our present President, 
Joseph F. Smith. He says, the in- 
dividual who slanders you is the 
one who is in enmity against you. 
He gives as an illustration of it 
the individual who sifts his ashes 
only when the wind blows your 
way, and your wife has her wash- 
ing on the line ; he is the individual 
who is in hostility to you, and will 
say harsh things against you; and 
because that individual was in close 
proximity to the Mormon people, 
he argued that he necessarily knew 
all about them, just as though one 
should argue that the people who 
put Jesus to death knew Him a 
great deal better than we do our- 
selves. I believe, with Elder Mc- 
Kay, that it is those who speak 
evil against us who either do not 
understand us,or have some sinister 
reason for the slanders they express 
regarding us; and I believe that 
the former class very greatly pre- 
ponderates. As expressed by Emer- 
son, the philosopher, "Nothing 
shall warp me from the belief that 
all men everywhere love the 



truth;" that is the universal rule. 
When we, who have studied Mor- 
monism for some years, realize 
what a grand system of truth it is, 
how vast is its compass, and what 
a length of time it requires to ful- 
ly understand and comprehend all 
the principles of Mormonism, we 
can not wonder that some individ- 
uals who give only a passing day, 
or at most a few weeks, to the 
study of this system, this collec- 
tion of truths, to the habits, ways, 
customs and beliefs of this great 
people, and the organization of the 
Church, we do not wonder that 
they are not able in that short space 
of time, to come to any perfect un- 
derstanding, or to anything like a 
proper conception of this vast sys- 
tem and this important work. 

I pray the blessings of the Lord 
to rest upon this congregation of 
the Latter-day Saints, also on those 
who are not here assembled, that 
the prayer and the words of the 
brethren this day may be verified, 
in that the instructions and spirit 
of this conference may be taken to 
the various stakes, wards, and 
branches of the Church. May the 
Lord bless us, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and friends, and help us to en- 
dure true and faithful to the end, 
which I ask, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 
"Rouse, O ye mortals." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 &. 
m. Monday, April 5th. 



SECOND DAY. 



In the Tabernacle, Monday, April 
5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

Prayer was offered by Bishop 
Orrin P. Miller. 
The choir sang the hymn : 

O'er the gloomy hills of darkness, 
Look, my soul, be still and gaze; 

All the promises do travail 
With the glorious day of grace. 



ELDER 0BS0N F. WHITNEY. 

The equality of man. — Common consent 
basic principle of the American gov- 
ernment and of the Church of Christ. 
— Two sources of power. — The order 
of Enoch. — The modern Zion. — The 
perfect government yet to come. — All 
things preparing the way. 

"We hold these truths to be self- 
evident: that all men are created 
equal; that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain inalien- 
able rights; that among these are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap- 
piness; that to secure these^ rights, 
governments are institutecTamong 
men, deriving their just powers 



from the consent of the governed." 

These words, I need not inform 
you, are contained in the Declara- 
tion of Independence, issued from 
the city of Philadelphia one hun- 
dred and thirty-five years ago, 
come next Fourth of July. They 
embody principles underlying the 
structure of the government of the 
United States, which there had its 
origin. Fifty-four years later, or 
seventy-nine years ago., come to- 
morrow, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
organized at the little village of 
Fayette, Seneca County, New York. 

I am proud and happy today, 
my brethren and sisters, to be a 
Latter-day Saint, and I am also 
proud and happy to be a citizen of 
this great Republic, the mightiest 
and best government organized by 
man that the sun shines upon. I 
am glad that I can see, as you 
can, a divine purpose in the found- 
ing of this Government, as in the 
founding of this Church. I believe 
there is a relationship between 
them, — not a union of church and 
state, but the relationship of a com- 
mon purpose, and that purpose 
God's — He who was the founder 
of this Church and also the found- 
er of this Nation. It was some- 
thing more than a coincidence that 
the Gospel of Christ, now called 
Mormonism, but whose proper sur- 
name is the Perfect Law of Lib- 
erty, should come forth upon this 
land of liberty in these last days. 
I desire if I may have the Spirit of 
the Lord, to indicate some of the 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

points of relationship between this 
great religious government and the 
great civil government that came 
before it to prepare its way. 

It may seem preposterous to 
many to refer to a nation of 
seventy or eighty millions of peo- 
ple, as the fore-runner of a move- 
ment that has a membership at the 
present time of only four or five 
hundred thousand souls. But we 
must bear in mind that numbers do 
not determine great principles, and 
that bigness is not always great- 
ness. This nation of eighty mil- 
lions was once a nation of three 
millions, sprung from a few feeble 
colonies comprising at the begin- 
ning only a few hundred starving, 
ragged souls. We must also 
remember that this Church began 
with but six members, and that it 
now counts its members, as stated, 
by hundreds of thousands. Fifty 
or a hundred years hence, it will 
be found that Mormonism has 
grown and prospered until no, na- 
tion under heaven need hang its 
head in shame at being considered 
its fore-runner and its friend. We 
must give all great movements 
time in which to develop them- 
selves, and meanwhile it is more 
important to consider principles 
than the number of people who be- 
lieve in them. 

It was something more than a 
coincidence, when the Church of 
Christ was organized in these days, 
that the same principles which un- 
derlie the structure of the Ameri- 
can government were embodied in 
the foundations of the work of 
God. I have cited two great 
principles to which I wish to call 
your attention — the equality of 
man and the doctrine of common 
consent. Thomas Jefferson affirm- 
ed, when he wrote the Declaration 
of Independence, that all men are 



created equal. We are not to un- 
derstand from this that all men are 
alike. All men are not six feet 
high ; all men do not weigh two 
hundred pounds; all are not rich; 
all are not poor. All men are not 
leaders — there are mountains and 
foot-hills and plains among hum- 
anity; there will always be great 
men and great women to be the 
leaders and instructors of the rest. 
Yes, even in a democracy, where 
all men are declared to be equal. 
What is meant, then, by equality, 
as referred to in the Declaration? 
It is equality before the law; it 
means that all men are equally en- 
titled to life, to liberty, and to the 
pursuit of happiness. It means that 
the avenues of promotion and ad- 
vancement should be open to all, 
as God intended them to be when 
He sent from Heaven the gospel 
of salvation, which is no more nor 
less than a code of laws, a system 
of principles having in view the 
eternal progress of man. 

Joseph the Prophet declared 
that God in the beginning insti- 
tuted certain laws, whereby the les- 
ser intelligences surrounding Him 
might have the opportunity to ad- 
vance like Himself. They were 
not equal there; they are not equal 
here ; they will never be equal in 
every sense. God will always be 
supreme. "The Glory of God is in- 
telligence," and what made Him 
God, was the superior intelligence 
that recognized those saving and 
ennobling principles which He in- 
stituted as the gospel of salvation, 
the means of eternal progress. All 
men are not equal in capacity, in 
intelligence, but they ought to be 
equal in opportunities for progres- 
sion, and God has made them equal 
in this respect. The king upon his 
throne can obtain salvation upon 
no easier terms than the peasant in 



74

his cot. The poor man is the equal 
of the rich man when he stands 
before God and asks, What must 
I do to be saved? There is no 
purchasing our way into the 
Kingdom of Heaven ; money can 
buy many things, but it cannot buy 
membership in the Church of 
Christ; it cannot buy the principles 
of truth, the blessings of the Gos- 
pel, the gifts of the Holy Ghost. 
All men are equal before God in 
respect of these things. In this 
great government of ours, whose 
basic declaration is that govern- 
ments derive their just powers 
from the consent of the governed, 
and in the Church of God, found- 
ed upon the principle and doctrine 
of common consent, it is intended 
that all men, so far as possible, 
shall be equal. 

It is also intended that men shall 
be free; but our idea of freedom 
does not go so far as to shut out 
God from a voice in the govern- 
ment — this religious government 
to which we belong. It was neces- 
sary, when the American govern- 
ment was founded, that no relig- 
ion should be recognized — no par- 
ticular religion — no man's religion 
and that the people alone should 
be regarded as the source of civic 
power; because this government 
was organized for the benefit of all 
men, religious and irreligious ; men 
of all religions and of no religion; 
consequently it had to recognize the 
people, and the people alone, as the 
fountainhead of authority. But in 
the Church of God, we are not so 
handicapped. We all believe alike, 
we all have the same religion, and 
we recognize God as the primal 
source, and the people as the sec- 
ondary source of power. God 
speaks, and the people say amen. 
It is different in a secular govern- 
ment, such as the government of 



the United States. But these great 
Democratic or Republican doc- 
trines — I care not which you call 
them, for I am not speaking in a 
partisan sense — these great prin- 
ciples involving the rights of man 
underlie both the government of 
the Church and the government of 
the State. 

When Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, on the 6th of April, 1830, 
brought the little flock together 
that were subsequently known as 
Latter-day Saints,thesei leaders were 
required by the Lord to present 
their names to that little congre- 
gation, to see whether or not they 
would sustain them as the presiding 
officers of the Church. These men 
had communed with angels; they 
had had the hands of angels laid 
upon their heads; Joseph had seen 
the Father and the Son. But these 
wonderful manifestations, and the 
powers of the priesthood which 
they had received, did not qualify 
them to preside over that congre- 
gation. There was yet something 
necessary, and what was it? "The 
consent of the governed." The 
people who were to be presided 
over by these men — the first and 
second Elders of the Church — had 
the right to consent to the exer- 
cise of that authority over them. 
God will select a prophet, a mouth- 
piece, a bearer of His priesthood, 
a teacher of His truth, without 
asking any man's permission; but 
He will never foist upon any man, 
nor upon any set of men or wo- 
men^ leader,a presiding officer that 
they are not willing to sustain. 
This is a recognition of the great 
doctrine embodied in the Declara- 
tion of Independence — that gov- 
ernments derive their just powers 
from the consent of the governed. 
You will see this great principle 
exemplified during this conference. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

You will be called upon to hold up 
your hands to vote whether or not 
you will sustain men and women 
as your leaders, your teachers, and 
presiding officers, and you have a 
perfect right to decide that ques- 
tion for yourselves. 

If that little congregation which 
I have mentioned had lifted their 
hands against Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowderv, what would have 
been the result? Would it have 
taken from Joseph and Oliver their 
priesthood ? No. Would it have blot- 
ted out the fact that they had con- 
versed with angels, and been or- 
dained by them ? No. Would it have 
made them any less God's mouth- 
pieces to that generation? No. 
What would it have done ? It would 
simply have prevented them from 
presiding over that particular con- 
gregation ; but they could have 
gone anywhere else where men and 
women were to be found willing 
to receive them, and could have or- 
ganized the Church of Christ by 
virtue of the priesthood which God 
had bestowed upon them. Let us 
remember that God has some 
rights as well as the people. While 
the people are duly considered, and 
a jealous care exercised for them 
and for their rights, the Lord must 
also be taken into account. He 
will not be deprived of His preroga- 
tives. It is God and the people 
who make up the government of 
the Church of Christ. 

Now as to the principle of equal- 
ity — that also is one of the fund- 
amentals of the Church. Not only- 
are the Latter-day Saints equal in 
the votes which they cast at a con- 
ference, and in their opportunities 
for eternal salvation, but from the 
beginning it was the design to es- 
tablish in the midst of this peo- 
ple an order that would make men 
equal in temporal as in spiritual 



things. It was called the Order of 
Enoch, for, in the days of Enoch, 
when his city was sanctified and 
taken into the heavens, "The Lord 
called his people Zion, because they 
were of one heart and one mind 
and dwelt in righteousness, and 
there was no poor among them." 
It was the same system that the 
Nephites established upon this con- 
tinent, and for two hundred years 
maintained as a promise and a 
foreshadowing of the Millennium, 
when all men will be equal and 
free. It was the same order of 
things that the. Apostles at Jeru- 
salem sought to introduce; and it 
seems to have been manifested 
whenever the fullness of the pow- 
ers of the priesthood have been up- 
on the earth. Whenever the full- 
ness of the Gospel has been enjoyed 
by men, there 'has always been 
this tendency, this trend toward 
equality, for it is the most perfect 
social condition. 

"For forms of government let 

fools contest; 
What's best administered is 

best." 

So says the poet Pope. Never- 
theless, I am convinced that of all 
governments the greatest and the 
best is that government in which 
the people govern themselves. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith was 
asked bv a stranger visitor at Nau- 
voo, "How do you govern these 
people, these Americans, these 
Britons. these Scandinavians, 
these men from all parts of the 
world, all nationalities, speaking 
different languages, having dif- 
feren customs and traditions, — 
how do you govern them, that they 
live together in peace, with a com- 
mon purpose, and in the spirit of 
unity?" The Prophet sagely an- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



swered — and he never said a wiser 
thing — "I teach them correct prin- 
ciples, and they govern them- 
selves." That government in which 
the people can and do govern 
themselves by obedience to correct 
principles, is manifestly superior 
to any government that depends 
upon one man's will. The word of 
God declares, "It is a slothful ser- 
vant who waits to be commanded 
in all things." Even in a govern- 
ment where God might command 
and direct in everything, the con- 
dition would be inferior to what it 
would be in a community of en- 
lightened freemen, enjoying the 
fullness of the Gospel, filled with 
the knowledge of the heavens, do- 
ing good of their own accord, gov- 
erning themselves, loving their 
neighbors and doing ah things with 
an eye single to the glory of God. 

This blessed condition is the des- 
tiny of the Latter-day Saints, who 
have been called upon to build up 
Zion on the North American con- 
tinent. The City of Enoch, and 
that order of equality which Enoch 
established, was only a token and 
a type of the greater Zion of the 
last days, which is to become the 
joy of the whole earth. The Pro- 
phet Isaiah spoke of it in these 
words. 

"Arise, shine; for thy light is 
come, and the glory of the Lord is 
risen upon thee. 

"For, behold, the darkness shall 
cover the earth, and gross dark- 
nes the people; but the Lord shall 
arise upon thee, and His glory shall 
be seen upon thee. 

"And the Gentiles shall come to 
thy light, and kins:s to the bright- 
ness of thy rising." 

And when that Zion is establish- 
ed which is to be a magnet to the 
nations, and unto which they will 



bring their gold and glory as a 
tribute, a glad and willing tribute 
to Christ, the King — when the 
Saints succeed in accomplishing 
that wonderous work, it will be 
because they have put into prac- 
tice the principles that recognize 
the equality of man, and the right 
of man to consent, under God, as to 
who shall govern him, and how 
he shall be governed. 

There is no time now to preach 
a sermon upon such a subject, but 
a sermon might be preached that 
would show still further the re- 
lationship between the government 
of the United States and the gov- 
ernment of the Church of God. I 
believe that if we knew the whole 
of human history, we would see 
that men and nations, from the be- 
ginning, have carved out and pre- 
pared the way for other men and 
nations! We would find that all 
that has taken place in the world — 
God-inspired, heaven-directed — 
has had as its purpose the setting 
up of that perfect government 
which will yet sway the scepter 
over this planet, when Christ shall 
reign as King of kings ; that King- 
dom or Commonwealth for which 
all existing governments, knowing- 
ly or unknowingly, are preparing 
the way, and of which the work 
miscalled Mormonism is the im- 
mediate fore-runner. 

Each ray of light, each principle 
of power, 

Each epoch-making hap of his- 
tory, 

Had it a tongue would it not 
testify : 

There cometh after me a might- 
ier ; 

I but prepare the way his face 
before ; 

I but baptize with water, he 
with fire?

All these movements have as 
their decreed fulfilment and con- 
summation the mighty purpose of 
the allwise Ruler — 

"That God which ever lives and 

loves, 

One God, one law, one element, 
And one far-off, divine event, 
To which the whole creation 
moves." 

Sister Claudia Poulton sang the 
soprano solo, "Oh shining light di- 
vine." 



ELDER SERGE L. BALIFF. 

(Late President of Swiss and Ger- 
man Mission.) 

(In introducing the speaker. 
President Smith said : "Brother 
Baliff has just returned from a long 
mission in Germany and Switzer- 
land. For four years he presided 
over the Swiss and German mis- 
sion.) 

My beloved brethren and sisters : 
In standing before you this morn- 
ing, I feel my weakness, and I 
place myself in the hands of the 
Lord. I desire from the bottom 
of my heart that He will inspire 
me, in order that I may say a few 
words that will encourage some one 
on the path of life and salvation. 

The greatest testimony, to me, 
of the divine mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith is this conference — 
to see this vast assemblage of peo- 
ple who have gathered from all 
nations of the earth in response to 
the testimony of the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith. I rejoice, my brethren 
and sisters, in this great work in 



which we are engaged. It is inspir- 
ing to see an assemblage of such a 
class of people, who have gathered 
from all nations to serve the Lord 
in spirit and in truth. I have a 
testimony of this work. The Lord 
has revealed unto me that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet. I know, as I 
know that I live, that he was called 
of God to establish this great work 
upon the earth in our day. I have 
traveled in many large cities in 
the world. I have met with many 
people, but in all my experiences I 
never met such an assemblage as 
was present here yesterday. I never 
felt such a spirit, such a power of 
the Almighty, as was in our midst 
yesterday. It was a testimony to 
me that this is the work of the 
Lord, that the Lord is directing this 
work, and that we need not worry 
about the things that threaten it. I 
assure you, my brethren and sisters, 
that this work is in the hands of 
the Lord ; He is directing it, and 
will continue to direct it until He 
brings the ship Zion to a safe an- 
chor. 

I have had the privilege of bear- 
ing my testimony to many people, 
and I rejoice in this privilege. I 
thank the Lord for the privilege I 
have had of going into the nations 
of the earth and raising my voice 
in defense of the Gospel of truth. 
I know that God lives; I know 
that Jesus is the Christ ; and I know 
that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of 
the Lord. I rejoice in the oppor- 
tunity I have had to raise my voice 
among- the people of the world, in- 
forming them that God has again 
spoken from the heavens, that He 
has established His work upon the 
earth for the last time, and that 
the spme gifts and blessings that 
existed in the primitive church ex- 
ist in our day. Educated men often 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ask the question : Why is it that we 
do not see the gifts, powers and 
manifestations in the church to- 
day that were in the Church of 
Christ when He was upon the earth 
with His apostles ? I bear testimony 
to you today, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that the same gifts and bless- 
ings, and powers of the priesthood, 
exist in this Church today that ex- 
isted in the primitive church. I 
can bear testimony to you that I 
have heard men of science declare 
that certain children were doomed 
to die, that there was no power 
on earth that could heal them. I 
have myself, with my companions, 
entered houses of people who are 
not Saints, who had not made cov- 
enants with the Lord ; we have 
spoken with these people on the 
principles of the Gospel, have de- 
clared unto them that the same 
gifts and blessings now exist in the 
Church of God, and the same pow- 
er in the priesthood of God, as in 
times ancient. We have adminis- 
tered to children who have been 
given up by scientific men; and I 
testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that I have seen these 
children raised from their beds of 
affliction, they have been made 
whole. These people have mani- 
fested faith in the Gospel, and 
many of them have made covenants 
with the Lord. I remember one 
incident in particular, which took 
place in the city of Breslau. There 
was a young man, about twenty- 
two years of age, who was working 
as a bookkeeper, and who had been 
investigating the Gospel. One 
evening he came from his work and 
went immediately to bed. He felt 
sick ; he did not know what was 
the matter, and they sent for the 
doctor. When the doctor came he 
told him that one of his lungs was 



entirely gone, that the other lung 
was badly affected, and that he had 
but a few days to live. The young 
man had a wife and three children. 
He had heard the testimony of the 
elders of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and he sent 
for them and told them what the 
doctor had said. "But," he said, "I 
believe there is a power that is 
mightier; I believe there is a pow- 
er that is stronger than the power 
of man. I believe in the sayings 
of the Apostle James, in the 5th 
chapter and 14th verse, where he 
says, 'If you have sick among you, 
call in the elders and they will 
anoint you, and by the prayer of 
faith you will be healed.' " I tes- 
tify to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this man had faith in the 
power of God. By his request the 
elders anointed him ; he was made 
whole and is a strong man today, 
performing his duties. 

I want to say further, that I have 
demonstrated the power there is in 
obedience to the principle of tith- 
ing, paying an honest tithing, being 
honest with the Lord. The young 
man I refer to joined the Church, 
shortly after the experience I have 
related. His salary was such that 
he could just meet all of his ex- 
penses. He had no surplus at the 
end of the month, but he heard of 
the principle of tithing, and he said : 
"I am going to pay my tithing, and 
I believe that the Lord will open 
the way for me." That month he 
paid his honest tithing. The next 
month, without saying anything to 
him, his employer advanced his sal- 
ary twenty marks, and this was 
more than the amount he had paid 
as tithing. This is another testi- 
mony to me that the Lord works in 
behalf of His children, and if they 
will render obedience unto Hip 



ELDER SERGE L. BALIFF. 



79 



commandments, he will provide 
ways and means whereby they can 
accomplish their righteous pur- 
poses. 

I rejoice in this work. I know 
that it is the work of the Lord, and, 
as I said before, I know that the 
Lord is directing it. I know there 
are thousands of people in the 
world today who are waiting anxi- 
ously for this Gospel. In the Swiss 
and German mision, during the 
time I have been there, we have dis- 
tributed 2,294,038 tracts, from door 
to door. We have baptized 1,867 
souls. Now, these are merely fig- 
ures showing what we have actual- 
ly done, but they do not represent 
one-thousandth part of the work 
that has been done in the mission 
field. Not long ago I was in the 
city of Berlin, and I was invited to 
the home of a man who is many 
times a millionaire. While I was 
conversing with him he said, "Mr. 
Baliff, I have heard of you; and I 
want to learn more of you ; and I 
want to hear more of your Gospel." 
He brought his wife and two child- 
ren and introduced them to me. He 
spoke the German, French and 
English languages. We had a 
pleasant time together, and he said : 
"I want to protect you brethren 
here in this city, with my means 
and influence; I will use my in- 
fluence to bring about the liberty of 
the I atter-day Saints in preaching 
the Gospel." 

It is the influence of such men 
as this that brings about, and helps 
to maintain, our religious freedom 
in the city of Berlin, at the present 
time. I want to say further, my 
brethren and sisters, especially to 
those parents who have young men 
in the mission field, don't be alarm- 
ed about your sons. They are in 
the hands of the Lord, and 
He is able to take care of 



them, and He will take care 
of them. In some instances your 
young men may be arrested, and 
spend a few days behind prison 
bars; but I say they can't be en- 
gaged in a greater work than this 
ministry. There are very few of 
our elders who have in any way 
suffered in those prisons. I have a 
son who was arrested for preaching 
the Gospel, and spent a little time in 
prison. I have a son who has been 
banished from one province in Ger- 
many, and many of you also have 
missionary sons who have been ban- 
ished and driven; but the hand of 
the Lord has been with them. They 
are not suffering, even those who 
have been cast into prisons. Those 
prisons are kept clean. The officers 
are extremely careful to see that 
those arrested are clean enough to 
go into the prisons. As a rule, our 
young men are given a bath before 
they are permitted to eo into these 
prisons. (Laughter.) Probably they 
did not need it; at any rate they 
had the bath before they were put 
in prison. The beds in those places 
have iron cushions, but at the same 
time they are clean, so the young 
men are not in danger of being in- 
fected with any disease in those 
prisons. 

Our young men in the mission 
field, in Germany, Switzerland, 
Austria Hungaria, and France, are 
doing excellent work ; and I feel 
proud to have been numbered 
among them. Although I have been 
presiding, and it is said I am re- 
leased from the Swiss and German 
mission, I hope the time may never 
come when I shall be released from 
interest in that mission. My heart 
and soul is in that work; I know 
it is a work of greatest importance. 
There is the blood of Israel in Ger- 
many and Switzerland, and the peo- 
ple are waiting anxiously for the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Gospel. Just as fast as we are 
able to give the Gospel to the hon- 
est in heart, I say they will accept 
it, because they are the blood of 
Israel, and they will some time re- 
ceive it. I know that the Lord is 
no respecter of persons; I know 
that is a good nation, and the day 
will come when thousands will em- 
brace the Gospel. My brethren 
and sisters, we have not one- tenth 
of the missionaries that we need. 
Do not be alarmed when you hear 
that your son is away up in Kiel, 
or on the frontier of Russia. We 
have not half enough elders to take 
care of the branches. There are 
many places in Germany today 
where one elder is presiding over 
three branches, and it is a hard 
task on him. I appeal to young 
Israel, to you young men who were 
born under the covenant ; there is a 
great work devolving upon you. I 
believe the time will come when 
you will be called out in quorums 
to go and warn the nations. We are 
establishing branches and confer- 
ences, and we are going to establish 
stakes of Zion throughout all lands. 
The Gospel is large and comprehen- 
sive; it is not alone this nation in 
America that is going to receive the 
Gospel; but it is to be proclaimed 
in all parts of the earth. The peo- 
ple of all nations are the children 
of the Lord, and the Gospel is in- 
tended to save the entire human 
family. 

I rejoice in this work. I am 
grateful for the privilege of meet- 
ing with you; and I pray that the 
blessings of the Lord may ever at- 
tend this people. I hope the time 
will come when we will all observe 
the admonition contained in the 
revelation given to the Prophet 
John Taylor, "Set your house in 
order." My brethren and sisters, 
let us examine ourselves. I want 



to examine myself and my house- 
hold. Am I in order? Am I a light 
and an example to the world? Can 
I stand up and say to people in 
the world, follow me? Can I go 
to nations of the earth and say, 
Take me as an example, as a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ? 
I have been baptized; I have made 
covenants with the Lord, has it 
made me better? Am I a better 
man through having accepted the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ? If not, the 
Gospel of Christ has been with- 
out effect and without avail to me. 
But, I say that every person who 
has joined the Church and made 
covenants with the Lord, if they 
have lived up to the teachings of 
the Gospel, they should be, and they 
are lights to the world, they are a 
power for good wherever they go. 
Let us govern ourselves ; let us gov- 
ern our families; in order that the 
world may look upon us and say, 
They are indeed worthy of our em- 
ulation. Let us not forget the peo- 
ple who do not understand the ways 
of the Lord; let us be charitable; 
let us learn to love them. Let us 
extend the hand of fellowship to 
the whole world. Let us be forerun- 
ners, and prepare the way for the 
Lord's coming. There are millions 
of honest people in the world who 
will accept the Gospel, just as soon 
as they can understand it and that 
is our real purpose,our real motives 
in preaching and spreading the 
Gospel of life and salvation. 

May the Lord help us all to do 
right. I appeal to young Utah, 
young Zion, young Israel, t( put 
your whole faith and trust in the 
Lord. I would like to impress you 
with the fact that this' Gospel is 
a gospel of science; it contains all 
science. But don't allow yourselves 
to be misled by the word "science." 
The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the 



GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



81 



root of all science, all knowledge. 
Base yourselves on the foundation 
of the Gospel of Christ, and 
through that you will obtain the 
keys to all sciences that exist upon 
the earth; it is the fountain-head 
of all science. 

May the Lord bless you; may 
He comfort and bless Zion. May 
He bless you parents who have 
young men in the mission field. Do 
not feel alarmed ; they are in the 
hands of the Lord. They are a 
noble band ; I love them as I love 
my own life, and I want to say that 
the Lord loves them. They are 
keeping the Word of Wisdom, and 
that is another key to their success. 
They live near to the Lord; He 
is watching over them, and there is 
no fear. Brethren and sisters, 
don't send your boys too much 
money ; the money is needed here in 
Zion. I do not want to be radical, 
but I suggest that you should send 
them just what you feel they ab- 
solutely need. There are many El- 
ders in the mission field today who 
are spending; very little money; 
there are some who are not spend- 
ing any, they are going absolutely 
without money, in a way. Let us 
be wise about this; not that we 
wart you to be scrimpy and stingy. 
There is a great blessing that goes 
to t^e missionaries who are preach- 
ing the Gospel. There is never a 
time when a man is more hum- 
ble than when he is wholly depend- 
ent upon the Lord; and I have 
never seen the time, in my exper- 
ience, when the Lord failed to sup- 
plv the wants of His humble and 
honest servants. I know He has 
dore it: I have proven it. I know 
that the Lord is waiting anxiously 
to Mess us, if we will just live so 
that we merit and deserve His 
blessings. May the Lord help us to 



be faithful and true, I ask it, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

The law of tithing a temporary sub- 
stitute for consecration. — Faithful 
observance of this lower law ab- 
solutely essential. — Attitude of those 
who do not pay full tithing. — Good 
reasons for regular and prompt pay- 
ment. 

My soul has been fed, during this 
conference, by the influence of the 
Spirit of the Lord, which has been 
with us, and by the testimonies 
which have been borne, as well as 
the valuable instructions given by 
the servants of the Lord as they 
were actuated by His Holy Spirit. 

I very earnestly desire that the 
time which I shall occupy, this 
morning, may be profitable unto us 
all. To this end I pray the Lord 
to bless me, and I solicit your sym- 
pathy and prayers of faith. 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with all thy heart, and with all 
thy soul, and with all thy mind.* * 
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. On these two command- 
ments hang all the law and the 
prophets." 

I read a stanza from a hymn in 
our hymn book: 

"Glorious things are sung of Zion, 
Enoch's city seen of old; 

Where the righteous, being perfect, 
Walked with God in streets of 
gold. 

Love and vitrue, faith and wisdom, 
Gra^e and gifts were all com- 
bined ; 

As himself each loved his neigh- 
bor; 

All were one in heart and 
mind." 

Quoting from the first speaker

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this morning, Whenever the Gospel 
has been upon the earth in its ful- 
ness, the law of consecration and 
united order has been given unto 
the people of the Lord, such as ob- 
tained with Enoch and his people, 
when they attained such a degree of 
excellence in faith and righteous- 
ness. They not only loved the Lord 
with all their hearts but, as repres- 
ented in the hymn, "As himself, 
each loved his neighbor." That is 
what we may properly call the 
higher law, the law of consecra- 
tion, the united order. Some may 
ask, — If that law has been given to 
the people whenever the Gospel in 
its fulness has been upon the earth, 
how is it that we Latter-day Saints, 
living in the dispensation of the 
fulness of times, when the Gospel 
in its fullness has been restored to 
the higher law. It was taken from 
high law of consecration? In 
answer I might say that the law 
was offered unto Israel in these last 
days, as I understand it, but the 
people were not prepared to live 
the higher law. It was taken from 
us, and, for the time being at least, 
we have been given the law of tith- 
ing, the revenue law of the Church, 
and we are reauired to live this 
law. Great promises are given un- 
to us if we will be faithful in ob- 
serving this law, and condemnation 
is predicated upon us if we reject 
it. I am reminded here of ancient 
Israel and their experiences. Paul, 
in speaking of them to the Hebrews 
says : "For unto us was the Gospel 
preached, as well as unto them : 
but the word preached did not pro- 
fit them, not being mixed With 
faith, in them that heard it." In his 
epistle to the Galatians, he writes 
to this effect: The law of carnal 
commandments was given to Israel 
as a schoolmaster, to bring them 
up to a condition of faith where 



they could receive the higher law 
and enjoy the blessings of the holy 
priesthood. The Lord revealed, 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
that Moses and the Holy Priest- 
hood were taken out of the midst of 
Israel, because of the hardness of 
their hearts. But, we ought to be 
worthy to receive this higher law 
and be able to live it. That people, 
whose faith was of such a weak 
character that they were not per- 
mitted to enjoy the blessings of the 
Holy Priesthood, such as we enjoy 
today, were given the law of tith- 
ing. Israel had to pay tithing. 
The tribe of Levi was se- 
lected from the other tribes to min- 
ister in the priest's office, and they 
were supported by the tithes of the 
people of the other tribes; while 
they in turn had to pay their tithing 
upon all that came into their hands. 
In view of the greater blessings 
given to us, we ought to be more 
faithful than were the children of 
Israel under those conditions ; but 
the truth is that some are not liv- 
ing up to this law of tithing as 
strictly as we ought to do. Since 
we are in this condition, it would 
be useless to give unto us a higher 
law, requiring greater sacrifices. 
The observance, on the part of the 
Latter-day Saints, of the law of 
tithing, such as the Lord has given 
to us, as recorded in the 119th sec- 
tion of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
is an absolute necessity for the up- 
building of the kingdom of our 
Father in the last days. A true ob- 
servance of this law is necessary for 
our temporal and spiritual bless- 
ing, and eternal salvation. The 
Lord has promised that, if we ob- 
serve this law, He will bless us tem- 
porally. We had an example re- 
lated here by Elder Baliff, where 
the man who paid his tithing had 
his wages increased. That is only 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



83 



one instance out of thousands that 
might be cited, illustrating how, in 
a temporal way, the Lord has bless- 
ed those who have paid their tithes 
faithfully. He has said, as record- 
ed in Proverbs, 3rd chapter, "Hon- 
or the Lord with thy substance, 
and with the first fruits of all thine 
increase ; so shall thy barns be 
filled with plenty, and thy presses 
shall burst out with new wine." 
Then, He has told us, through Mal- 
achi, some of the things that will 
befall those who do not keep this 
commandment. When Israel failed 
to comply with this law, He charg- 
ed them as being robbers, "vea rob- 
bers of God," and called them to 
repentance. I take it that the same 
terms might be applied to us if we 
disregard that law today; yet, it is 
a fact that some deserve it. 

I remember, as I read in the 
Scripture, that, when the law of 
consecration was in vogue among 
the Saints at Jerusalem, a certain 
man and wife, Ananias and Sap- 
phira, were commanded to dispose 
of their property and bring the pro- 
ceeds of the sale in to the common 
treasury of the Church. You will 
remember their fate, that which be- 
fell them because they undertook 
to deceive the servants of the Lord. 
They sold their properties and 
brought only a part of the proceeds 
to Peter, and Peter, bv the power 
of the Holy Ghost, discerned and 
understood the intended deception 
on the part of Ananias. By the 
power of the Lord, Ananias was 
stricken dead ; and because his wife 
was a party to the deception, she 
also, by the same power was 
stricken. 

I sometimes think of our atti- 
tude on this question, as a people. 
The Lord has said — "one-tenth of 
your interest annually." If we part 
with this world's goods and obtain 



eternal life we will be rich, 
but if we lose eternal life, lose our 
faith, go into darkness, apostatize 
from the truth and lose our hope 
of eternal life, we will indeed be 
poor. I fear that because we have 
not complied faithfully with the re- 
quirements of the Lord pertain- 
ing to this particular law, some 
of us are in darkness, and the light 
of the Spirit does not shine in our 
souls; therefore, we can not have 
the hope of a glorious resurrection 
and eternal salvation in the celestial 
kingdom of our Father. We are 
told, in the revelations, that we 
must have an assurance that our 
course of life is approved of the 
Lord, or we can not exercise that 
faith which is necessary to take 
hold upon the blessings of eternal 
life. If I neglect to comply with 
the law, or only partially comply 
with the law, do I know that my 
course is approved of the Lord? 
Nay, verily, but the reverse; I 
would know better than any other 
man in the world that my course 
of life is not approved of the Lord; 
and it would be impossible for me 
to exercise faith sufficient to take 
hold upon the blessings of eternal 
life. Hence, the danger in neglect- 
ing our duty in relation to this 
very important law. I said that it 
is absolutely necessary for the wel- 
fare of the Church, and the ad- 
vancement of the work of the Lord, 
that the Latter-day Saints pay their 
tithing. This is another great rea- 
son whv the Lord has commanded 
that we should give a tenth of our 
interest annually, that the Church 
may be maintained, that its tem- 
poral interests may grow and de- 
velop. The law, as given in the 
words of the Lord to Joseph Smith, 
states that we shall pay our tithing, 
a tenth of our interest annually. 
Because the law is so stated, many 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of our people have gotten the idea 
that they need pay no tithing until 
the end of the year, and then, when 
they have decided what they owe as 
a tithing, make settlement — provid- 
ing they are able to do so. In too 
many instances they are not able 
to make full settlement when the 
end of the year comes. It is a dan- 
gerous procedure, and a wrong in- 
terpretation of the law. As the 
Lord gives to us we should tithe, 
at the very time that it is given. 
The Church needs the tithing just 
as much in the commencement of 
the year, and during the middle of 
the year, as it does at the end of 
the year. Demands upon the 
Trustee-in-trust are continuous, 
and enormous. For our own good, 
and for the welfare of the Church, 
we ought to pay when it is due, 
and remove far from us the tempta- 
tion to withhold our tithings ;know- 
ine. as we ought to know, the in- 
jury there is to ourselves and the 
Church in failing to pay an honest 
titHnsr. If we put it off until the 
end of the year, the temptation is 
greater: when we come to figure 
out what we justly owe to the Lord 
— one-tenth of all our interest — it 
looms up big before us. We have 
used, perhaps, all our means as it 
has come into our hands ; we have 
felt that it was necessary to live 
to "the full extent of our income. 
We have not felt able to curtail our 
expenses, to live within our means, 
and lay by a little for the payment 
of our tithing. The result is that 
when the end of the year comes, 
there are a multitude of demands 
made upon us — our winter supply 
of fuel, taxes, clothing for the fam- 
ily, innumerable obligations, some 
of them unexpected and unlocked 
for. In addition to all these de- 
mands we have before us the settle- 
ment of our tithing. We find that 



some are no better prepared to pay 
even one month's tithing at the end 
of the year than they were in the 
month of January, February, or 
March, to pay the tithing due at 
that time. Of course, there are 
some who do not receive their in- 
terest monthly. This will not apply 
to them entirely; but when funds 
come into their hands, whether it 
be once in three months, once in 
six months, or at the close of the 
year, they should make settlement 
with the Lord as they obtain their 
substance. With the farmers, if we 
put our grain into bins and our hay 
in stacks and reserve it, holding for 
a better price, that we may get a 
little more credit" on the tithing 
records, we are endangering our 
ability to meet the obligation later 
on ; it is an unsafe proposition. The 
thing to do is to take our grain 
from the thresher and give one- 
tenth to the Lord ; and hay from 
the field and do the same, and so 
with other products and interests. 
This requires less exercise of faith 
and there is less temptation to 
withhold any part of our tithing. 
We pray, "Lead us not into 
temptation;" the Lord expects us 
to help ourselves and avoid tempta- 
tion. This is one means by which 
we can do so; and I recommend 
to the Latter-day Saints that hence- 
forth we pay tithing as we go 
along — a just and full tithing, that 
we may be conscientious and our 
minds be free and easy, that we 
may know so far as complying 
with that law is concerned, we have 
done the will of the Lord and can 
claim the promised blessing. 

In order that the law of tithing 
may be made universal and general 
— realizing that we are prone to 
say that such instructions are for 
some one else, and not apply them 
directly to ourselves — I recommend 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS.

that a course be taken such as has 
been taken with respect to the 
Word of Wisdom. It is not un- 
usual to hear a president report in 
a stake of Zion that all the stake 
officers, and all the ward officers, 
in his stake keep the Word of Wis- 
dom, as well as a very large per- 
centage of the people. Why? Be- 
cause they have adopted a system 
of beginning at the head, with the 
presidencies of stakes, to see that 
this law is observed — just as we 
have begun with the Presidency of 
the Church, the Twelve, the First 
Council of Seventy, the Patriarch 
and Presiding Bishopric; all these 
general authorities observe that 
law, and this movement has gone 
from the officers of the Church to 
the people. They have felt the in- 
fluence of this movement, and it 
has become universal, or at least 
popular among us as a people to 
observe the Word of Wisdom. If 
we adopt the same means with this 
law of tithing-, which is of more 
importance, if possible, than the 
Word of Wisdom, I believe we will 
be able to achieve the same results. 
If we do so, the blessings of the 
Lord will be poured out upon us. 
We will be perparing ourselves to 
make the greater sacrifice, to yield 
obedience to the higher law, which 
must come before our salification. 
As long as we disregard the les- 
ser law, in part, we know that we 
are not prepared for that sanctify- 
ing law of consecration. The 
greater the sacrifice the greater the 
blessing, for sacrifice brings forth 
the blessings of heaven. Let us 
try it. 

God heln us to be faithful in the 
observance of this law, and all His 
laws and commandments. Let us 
live according to our profession of 
faith, that we may indeed be a light 
unto the world, that the world see- 



ing our good works may be led to 
glorify God and to serve and 
worship Him. May the Lord bless 
us to this end, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Junius F. Wells. 

Conference adjourned until 2 
p. m. 



"AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 

fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Frank Y. Taylor. 

The choir sang the anthem, "O 
come, let us sing unto the Lord."

shown by legislators. — Saints ad- 
vised to continue fight for the right. 

While I address the congrega- 
tion, this afternoon, I hope that I 
may have a good degree of the 
Spirit of the Lord, that we may 
continue to enjoy the inspiration of 
God, and through it be instructed 
and blessed. I have enjoyed the 
meetings of the conference thus 
far. I have rejoiced greatly in the 
remarks that have been made, and 
the testimonies that have been borne 
by the brethren who have ad- 
dressed the saints. 

In the year 1829, prior to the or- 
ganization of the Church, the Lord 
repeatedly said unto Joseph Smith 
and through Joseph Smith, to oth- 
ers, that a great and marvelous 
work was about to come forth 
among the children of men. If this 
statement would bear repetition, 
even by the mouth of God, prior to 
the organization of this great work, 
we can certainly be permitted to 
repeat it now, when we see such a 
wonderful fulfillment of these pre- 
dictions. As I sat yesterday and 
looked over the vast multitude of 
saints, the passage kept recurring 
to my mind. How great and mar- 
velous is this work that has come 
forth among the children of men, 
beginning, as we have heard, in the 
organization of the Church with 
six members, and growing until 
now — although it is only a few 
years since the organization 
of the; Church — it numbers its 
members by hundreds of thou- 
sands, a great many of whom have 
assembled in conference upon this 
occasion, and who for years past 
have been meeting annually and 
semi-annually in this capacity. Al- 
though a numerous people, filling 
many villages, towns and cities, yet 
they all see eye to eye when the 
principles of the Gospel of life and 



salvation are considered. They 
have been drawn from all the na- 
tions of the earth, from all creeds, 
all faiths, all churches, all tongues 
and peoples ; and they have been 
united, by the Spirit of God, into 
one harmonious Church of Jesus 
Christ. This is marvelous, won- 
derfully marvelous; and it is not 
the only wonderful thing connected 
with this great work of the latter 
days. While we number the mem- 
bers of the Church by hundreds of 
thousands, who have embraced the 
truth as revealed through Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, there are still in 
the world other hundreds of thou- 
sands of men and women who be- 
lieve in the doctrines of the Gospel 
of Christ, as revealed of the Lord 
through Joseph Smith the prophet, 
and as preached and taught by our 
people. The remarkable effect of 
the Gospel upon the world causes 
one, who is aware of the fact, to 
stand in wonderment, when he 
realizes to what extent the words 
of the Lord, spoken in 1829, have 
been fulfilled. 

"Another parable spake He un- 
to them : The kingdom of heaven is 
like unto leaven, which a woman 
took, and hid in three measures of 
meal, till the whole was leavened." 
This little organization that was 
effected in 1830, has been the 
leaven in the hands of God which 
has been introduced in the world 
and is rapidly and most wonderful- 
ly leavening the whole lump. The 
ideas and views of the Christian 
world have changed to a marked 
degree. The doctrines believed in 
prior to, and immediately subse- 
quent to, the introduction of the 
Gospel of Christ, were quite differ- 
ent in some respects from what 
they are now. The Lord, through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, has re- 
vealed the truth, and the truth has

87 



had its effect among men. I notic- 
ed, a short time ago, one little 
item that goes far in showing to 
what extent the Gospel of Christ 
has leavened, and is leavening, the 
religious ideas and views of the 
world. I clipped an article from 
the Deseret News editorial col- 
umns ; it was orginally taken from 
th Montreal Star, and was then 
published and commented on by 
the Editor of the News, as follows : 

We have frequentlv remarked that 
the light of the Gospel is penetrat- 
ing the world of thought today, and 
enlightening it gradually. Truth is ris- 
ing and before its rays the shadows 
flee. 

One illustration of this is found in 
the attitude of Christians toward the 
doctrine of eternal punishment. We 
notice in the Montreal Star an article 
signed bv one Joseph Hamilton, in 
which the writer takes up the question 
of eternal punishment, as follows: 

"That doctrine is contained in the 
creed of both the Methodist and the 
Presbyterian churches, but do the min- 
isters believe it? If they do, would 
they not preach it; yes, preach it morn- 
ing, noon, and night? But, as a mat- 
ter of fact, they do not preach it. I 
never heard a sermon on it, or any at- 
tempt to prove it, since I was a child. 
A few weeks ago in a large congre- 
gation in Toronto the preacher asked 
for a show of hands on the part of 
any who had heard a sermon on heli 
within the past ten years. Two hands 
were held up. Some time ago a noted 
Methodist minister told me that the 
Methodist ministers of Canada do not 
believe in everlasting punishment. The 
Presbyterian ministers seem largely 
to hold the same view. Is the subject 
mooted at all in any Presbyterian 
church?" 

This caused another reader of the 
Montreal Star, Thomas Albert 
Shackelton, writes: 

"Editor of Daily Star: Dear Sir- 
Replying to the letter of Joseph Ham- 
ilton, of Lindsay, Ontario. I would 
say, I think the definition of eternal 
punishment, or everlasting punish- 



ment, is much misunderstood, and 
that the ordinary thought that it 
means an unending punishment is not 
taught in the Holy Bible. The Holy 
Bible teaches that the Author and 
Father of all life is eternal; is ever- 
lasting; hence the punishment meeted 
out to unrepentant souls is the pun- 
ishment of the eternal or everlasting 
Father, and the words eternal punish- 
ment have no reference to time what- 
soever, but simply refer to the punish- 
ment, as being God's punishment; 
hence is eternal punishment, or pun- 
ishment by the Eternal One. As proof 
I refer to the Epistle of Peter in 
which he speaks of Christ whilst His 
body was in the tomb, preaching to 
the spirits of those who for some time 
during the days of Noah were unre- 
pentant; showing there was a hope of 
final salvation for all through faith in 
Christ, and thus it's right to pray for 
cur dead." 

Where did our friend get this 
idea of Eternal punishment? Did 
he get it when he read Peter, and 
there learned that Christ had 
preached to the spirits in prison, or 
in the spirit world? If)' hte did, 
where did he get the idea that the 
doctrine enunciated by Peter refer- 
red to the salvation for the dead? 
That doctrine is very familiar to 
the Latter-day Saints We read in 
the Doctrine and Covenants a rev- 
elation given to Joseph Smith, in 
New York, in 1830; listen to it.: 

"I am Alpha and Omega, Christ 
the Lord; yea, even I am He, the be- 
ginning and the end, the Redeemer 
of the world. 

"I, having accomplished and finished 
the will of him whose I am, even the 
Father, concerning me — having done 
this that I mi°dit subdue all things un- 
to myself — 

"Retaining all power, even to the 
destroying of Satan and his works at 
the end of the world, and the last 
great day of judgment, which I shall 
pass_ upon the inhabitants thereof, 
judging every man according to his 
works and the deeds which he hath 
done. 

"And surely every man must repent 
or suffer, for I, God, am endless:

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Wherefore, I revoke not the judg- 
ments which I shall pass, but woes 
shall go forth, weeping, wailing and 
gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who 
are found on my left hand; 

"Nevertheless it is not written that 
there shall be no end to this torment, 
but it is written endless torment. 

"Again, it is written eternal dam- 
nation; wherefore it is more express 
than other scriptures, that it might 
work upon the hearts of the children 
of men altogether for my name's 
glory; 

"Wherefore I will explain unto you 
this mystery, for it is mete unto you to 
know even as mine aoostles. 

"I speak unto you that are chosen in 
this thing, even as one, that you may 
enter into my rest; 

"For, behold, the mystery of Godli- 
ness, how great is it? for, behold, I am 
endless, and the punishment which is 
given from my hand is endless punish- 
ment, for endless is my name ; wherefore 

"Eternal punishment is God's punish- 
ment. 

"Endless punishment is God's punish- 
ment. 

"Wherefore I command you to repent, 
and keep the commandments which you 
have received by the hand of my servant 
Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name; 

"And it is by my almighty power that 
you have received them." 

Our friend quotes almost ver- 
batim from the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and yet for proof of his 
views refers his congregation to 
the Bible, namely to the words of 
Saint Peter. And that is the state 
of the world. They have abandon- 
ed many doctrines which they 
formerly held; they have abandon- 
ed them, since Joseph Smith taught 
they were false; they have embrac- 
ed many of the truths of the ever- 
lasting gospel, since Joseph Smith 
revealed them to the world. But 
no, not on any account would they 
give credit where credit belongs. 
If this man were an honest man, 
he would have said : And for proof 
of this doctrine, I refer you to the 
19th section of the Doctrine and 



Covenants, a standard work of the 
Mormon Church, being the words 
of God to Joseph Smith the pro- 
phet ; and for my knowledge of the 
doctrine of salvation for those who 
are dead I refer you also to Joseph 
Smith the prophet, who preached 
it to the world, and first made clear 
the meaning of Peter's words. 

No, we do not hear any more 
damnation, hell fire, and infant 
burning, or everlasting or never 
ending punishment. No more pre- 
destination, and total depravity of 
the human heart. The topless throne 
and bottomless . pit are things of 
the past. Those doctrines are done 
away with ; they are not believed, 
or at least, if they are believed, 
they are not preached. I assure 
you, my brethren and sisters, they 
are not believed by hundreds of 
thousands of people whose minds 
have been enlightened by the 
preaching of the Gospel by the ser- 
vants of God, the Elders of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. Thus the leaven is 
working, and the people of the 
world are coming to see the truth. 
They are abandoning some of their 
false doctrines. They are preach- 
ing many of the truths that we 
preach and which were not. known 
to be true, in fact, they were look- 
ed upon as the greatest of heresy 
when Joseph Smith introduced 
them, and long after that time, even 
until the elders had preached the 
doctrines among many nations and 
tongues, and after the Spirit of the 
Lord rested upon the people, and 
made them understand and believe 
them As a result, while these 
thousands of men have, for reasons 
best known to themselves, not seen 
their way clear to join the Church 
of Christ and become members, 
they are falling away from other 
churches which have taught and

still retain false doctrines in their 
creeds. It is marvelous, too, that 
there are many honorable men in 
the earth, good men, who believe 
Mormonism, and they wish us God 
speed; "but,' they say, "so far as 
we are concerned, we can't live it; 
we are not good enough; or for 
other reasons we can not accept 
membership in the Church." But 
the time is coming when many of 
them will join the Church. This 
great work is going on ; the leaven- 
ing process is at work ; and as sure- 
ly as the Lord likened the kingdom 
of heaven unto this parable, so 
surely will the whole be leavened. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I 
want to speak a word or two on an- 
other subject. I want to read an- 
other passage of Scripture, and 
with the discourse of President 
Lund, yesterday, as a precedent, 
make a few remarks: 

"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: 
for all Israel were come to Shechem 
to make him king." 

'And it came to pass, when Jerobo- 
am, the son of Nebat, who was yet 
in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was 
fled from the presence of King Solo- 
mon, and leroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 

"That they sent and called him. 
And leroboam and all the congrega- 
tion of Israel came, and spake unto 
Rehoboam, saying, 

"Thy father made our yoke grievous, 
now therefore make thou the grievous 
service of thy father, and his heavy 
yoke which he put upon us, light- 
er, and we will serve thee." 

"And he said unto them, "Depart 
yet for three days, then come again 
to me." And the people departed. 

"And king Rehoboam consulted 
with the old men, that stood before 
Solomon his father while he yet lived, 
and said, "How do ye advise that I 
may answer this people?' 

"And they spake unto him, saying, 
'If thou wilt be a servant unto this 
people this day, and wilt serve them, 
and answer them, and speak good 
words to them, then they will be thy 
servants forever." 



"But he forsook the counsel of the 
old men, which they had given him, 
and consulted with the young men 
that were grown up with him, and 
which stood before him: 

"And he spake unto them, 'What 
counsel give ye that we may answer 
this people, who have spoken to me, 
saying, 'Make the yoke which thy 
father did put upon us lighter?" 

"And the young men that were 
grown up with him spake unto him, 
saying, 'Thus shalt thou speak unto 
this people that spake unto thee, say- 
ing, 'Thy father made our yoke heavy, 
but make thou it lighter unto us; thus 
shalt thou say unto them, 'My little 
finger shall be thicker than my father's 
loins. 

" 'And now whereas my father did 
lade you with a heavy yoke, I will 
add to your yoke, my father hath 
chastised you with whips, but I will 
chastise you with scorpions.' 

"So leroboam and all the people 
came to Rehoboam the third day, as 
the king had appointed, saying, Come 
to me again the third day. 

"And the king answered the people 
roughly, and forsook the old men's 
counsel that they gave him; 

"/ind spake to them after the coun- 
sel of the young men, saying, My 
father made your yoke heavy, and 1 
will add to your yoke: my father also 
chastised you with whips, but I will 
chastise you with scorpions. 

"Wherefore the king hearkened not 
unto the people; for the cause was 
from the Lord, that he might perform 
his saying, which the Lord spake by 
Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam 
the son of Nebat. 

"So when all Israel saw that the 
king hearkened not unto them, the 
people answered the king, saying, 
What portion have we in David? 
neither have we inheritance in the son 
of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now 
see to thine own house, * * * *" 
(I Kings, 12:1-17). 

That reminds me very much of 
what we have passed through in 
recent days. I do not forget, and 
I need ask no pardon for remind- 
ing you of it, that at our last con- 
ference we spoke out in favor of 
the closing of saloons, and cur- 
tailing the sale of intoxicating 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



liquors. As a people, as a con- 
ference of the Church, we spoke 
in the interest of prohibition. Not 
only did the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints but a great 
many people who love virtue, tem- 
perance, and purity of life, who 
believe in the doctrines enunciated 
in the opening remarks of our con- 
ference, also desired it. Other 
churches and organizations of good 
men and women declared their will 
and asked that we be given relief 
from the bondage under which we 
are now suffering, that of open 
saloons and the desecration of the 
Sabbath day. We asked our legis- 
lature to kindly grant us relief 
from these yokes of bondage. More 
than 75,000 people petitioned for 
it; the time was rope to secure it. 
The Savior on one occasion said : 
"What man is there of you, whom 
if his son ask bread, will he give 
him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, 
will he give him a serpent?" We 
asked for a Sunday law; we were 
given a stone. We asked for pro^ 
hibition, and the lower house of 
the legislature, with a very few 
dishonorable exceptions, stood as a 
man, to the last, for virtue and 
truth, for honesty and sobriety, and 
would have gladly given unto the 
people what they asked : viz, 
lighten our yoke; release us from 
this bondage that now is destroy- 
ing our sons and our daughters, 
and polluting our state. 

The senate was just the reverse, 
with a few very honorable ex- 
ceptions. Their answer was prac- 
tically this: We will defeat the 
House and deny the request of the 
people. If in the past they have 
been chastised with whips, we will 
chastise them with scorpions. We 
will not only not give them relief 
but, we will add to their burdens 



by fastening the whisky yoke more 
securely upon them. We will de- 
liver the state to the liquor dealer, 
and the people to the saloon keep- 
er. We will give those engaged in 
this dreadful business all the aid, 
comfort and support we possibly 
can, and greater license_than ever 
before. We have no respect, but 
on the contrary, only contempt for 
the will of the people. When they 
ask for bread we will give them a 
stone. And if they ask for a fish 
we will give them a serpent. And 
a serpent they gave us; and, a.& 
Solomon declared, "It biteth like a 
serpent and stingeth like an adder." 
That is what we got. They made 
a pretense of sincerity, by holding 
out hope of local option, with 
never a moment's intention of 
granting even that. Even a local 
option stone, when we asked for 
the bread of Prohibition, would . 
have been vastly better than the 
serpent they gave us. 

Well, so far as I am concerned, 
I still stand for purity of life, for 
prohibition, the closing of_saloons, 
the prevention of drunkenness, for 
every virtue and every good thing 
that will help the people. So far 
as I have authority to speak for 
the people of the Church of Christ, 
the Latter-day Saints still desire 
relief from this yoke; theydesire 
their burdens to be lightened. We 
desire the Sabbath day to be kept 
holy. We desire our children to 
grow up fearing God and keep- 
ing holy His Sabbath day; and 
we deplore the condition that pre- 
vails where legislators arise' and 
make light of, and ridicule the 
honest, sincere, and devout wish of 
a mighty people when they ask for 
relief from this desecration of the 
Lord's day. I fear for the peace 
and safety of our commonwealth ■

when our law makers refuse to 
listen to the voice of the people, 
and follow the advice of the wicked 
and immoral instead. I say to you 
Latter-day Saints, do not lose 
courage ; we have had to fight bat- 
tles for truth all our lives, andjust 
as the leaven is leavening the lump 
with reference to some ol the doc- 
trines of the Church and Kingdom 
of God, and as it will eventually 
leaven it all, so this will be part of 
it. We will live to see the day 
when we will find men who will not 
be like Rehoboam, the king, but 
men who will listen to the people. 
When the people say unto them: 
Give us relief, lighten the burdens 
that others have placed upon us, 
save our children from temptation 

- and ruin, they will hearken unto 
the will of the people : and. in 
God's name, we will then be freed 
from the bondage with which some 
of our pretended brethren would 
still shackle us. Then what shall 
we do? Why, to your tents, oh Is- 
rael! Back to your homes, increase 
your vigilance and watchfulness 
around vour own firesides, double 
and re-double your efforts to pre- 

- serve your sons and daughters, and 
your fair name, from the hands of 
those who would drag from your 
thresholds the innocence and pur- 
ity of your children, and sink it in 
the mire, for gain. 

Now, may God bless the peo- 
ple. May the Lord bless His cause, 
and may it continue to grow and 
work to the wonderment of the 
world, in a manner that shall cause 
all men to stand and declare: Lo, 
God must have spoken to Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, because his 
words are fulfilled; a most wonder- 
ful and marvelous work has come 
forth among the children of men. 
God bless Israel, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Remarkable fact that Christian nations 
need to have the Gospel preached to 
them. — Wonderful extent of -Latter- 
day Saint missions. — Miraculous evi- 
dences of divine authority. — Statis- 
tics showing great work accom- 
plished. 

U 

The brethren and sisters who 
have come to this conference have 
met with a rather cold reception; 
that is to say, the weather has been 
somewhat unfavorable. Last even- 
ing we had a light fall of snow, 
and today it has been quite chilly. 
It reminds be of a discussion that 
occurred between a Yankee and a 
Scotchman. They were talking 
about the cold weather in the north 
of Scotland. The Yankee said: 
"Your winters here are nothing to 
compare with the winters in the 
states. I recollect one winter," said 
the Yankee, "when a sheep, in 
jumping from a hillock into a .field, 
suddenly became frozen in passing, 
and stuck in the air like a mass of 
ice." (Laughter.) "My boy," said 
the Scotchman, "that could not be, 
for the law of gravitation would not 
allow it." "I know it," said the 
Yankee, "but the law of gravitation 
was frozen too." (Laughter.) 

Notwithstanding the, disturbance 
in the elements, the attendance at 
the conference and the interest in 
the meetings have not diminished. 
This is a splendid congregation, 
assembled this afternoon, but few 
seats in the house are unoccupied, 
and truly we have been having "a 
feast of fat things," a time of in- 
struction, in which I have rejoiced 
exceedingly. 

We read in the Scriptures of a 
very remarkable thing that is to 
take place in the latter-days. You 
will find it recorded in the book of 
Revelation, called the Revelation of 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Saint John the divine. The open- 
ing words of the Revelation read 
like this : 
- "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, 
which God gave unto him, to show 
unto His servants things which 
must shortly come to pass ; and he 
sent and signified it by His angel 
unto His servant John." 

In another place, when John was 
wrapped in heavenly vision, he saw 
a door in heaven open, and he heard 
the voice of an angel issuing, say- 
ing, "Come up hither and I will 
show you) what must be hereafter." 
So we would naturally conclude 
that the things which were written 
by John the revelator were things 
which must be fulfilled in the fut- 
ure, or in the latter days. Now, this 
is the remarkable thing to which 
John the revelator calls our at- 
tention ; he said : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the 
midst of heaven, having the everlast- 
ing gospel to preach unto them that 
dwell on the earth, and to every na- 
tion, kindred, and tongue, and people. 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God 
and give glory to Him; for the hour 
of His judgment is come: and wor- 
ship Him that made heaven, and earth, 
and the sea, and the fountains of 
waters." 

Wonder of wonders and mystery 
of mysteries ! Is it possible that in 
the latter days an angel should be 
seen flying through the midst of 
heaven, having the everlasting Gos- 
pel to preach to the enlightened 
Christian nations of the world? It 
is so recorded in the Bible. We be- 
lieve, and claim as a people, that 
that angel has come to the earth 
and appeared to Joseph Smith, in 
the person of Moroni, who deliver- 
ed to the youthful Prophet a record 
familiarly known as the Book of 
Mormon, a record containing the 
fulness of the Gospel, with a mes- 



sage that said Gospel must be 
preached in every nation under the 
heavens before the end should 
come. Shortly after the visitation 
of this angel, following the organ- 
ization of the Church, the Spirit 
fell upon the early elders, and they 
went forth into the regions round 
about, proclaiming the word. Thus 
the Gospel was introduced into the 
world in the nineteenth century; 
and it spread from town to town, 
from village to village, and from 
country to country, until in our day 
we have twenty-one missions es- 
tablished in the world. 

There are seven great missions in 
the United States: namely, the 
Eastern States, the Southern 
States, the Northern States, the 
Central States, the Western States, 
the Northwestern States and the 
California missions. We have a 
mission in Mexico, and six great 
missions in Europe, namely, a mis- 
sion in Great Britain, one in Scan- 
dinavia, in Sweden, in Germany, in 
Switzerland,in the Netherlands and 
in Turkey; one mission in South 
Africa; one in Japan. Five mis- 
sions upon the islands of the sea, 
namely, one in Hawaii, in Samoa, 
in New Zealand, in the Society Isl- 
ands, and in Australia; making 
twenty-one missions in all. One 
December 31, 1908, there were 
1,823 missionaries in the field. 

Now, the stranger might ask the 
question : That is a very good show- 
ing; you believe, then, that vou 
have the Gospel in its fulness ; that 
with the Gospel you expect to re- 
generate the world? The answer is 
yes, most assuredly. Then the ques- 
tion might be asked, With a hand- 
ful of people, with a very limited 
number of elders, how do vou ex- 
pect to accomplish it? Well, th^re 
you are. It ia a g-ood deal like the 
President stated it yesterdav, and 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



93 



we have heard this afternoon from 
Brother Hyrum: It is the leaven 
which will leaven the whole lump. 
These humble missionaries are go- 
ing forth into the world, bearing 
their burden and declaring the 
word. There will be some people 
who will hear the voice of the 
elders ; others will hear the voice of 
the Book of Mormon ; others, 
again, will hear the voice of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, others the 
voice of the Pearl of Great Price, 
others the Voice of Warning, and 
others still, the voice of a tract. 
Thus will a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel be spread to all nations and 
will be preached to every creature. 
But, it is not the fact that the eld- 
ers are going forth into the world 
to preach that is so significant, as 
it is the power and authority which 
accompanies them. Let me remind 
you, brethren and sisters, of the 
parting words of the Savior to His 
disciples ; He said : 

"Go ye into all the world and preach 
the gospel to every creature. He that 
believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved, but he that believeth not shall be 
damned." Now mark it: "These signs 
shall follow them that believe: In my 
name they shall cast out devils; they 
shall speak with new tongues; they 
shall take up serpents; and if they 
drink any deadly thing, it shall not 
hurt them; they shall lay hands on 
the sick, and they shall recover." 

That was the authority which 
was given to the disciples in the 
days of Christ; and immediately 
thereafter Christ was caught up in- 
to heaven and sat down on the 
right hand of His Father. The dis- 
ciples went forth proclaiming the 
word ; they were sustained of the 
Lord ; and the word was confirmed 
by the signs following. So it is, my 
brethren and sisters, in our day 
and time; so it is in the Church of 
Christ. You heard the testimony 



of Brother Baliff, this morning. Let 
me also give you an example. In 
fact, it comes rather close home to 
me: I have a son now in the mis- 
sion field, a boy about twenty years 
of age, who went forth with a lim- 
ited knowledge of the Gospel, with 
fear and trembling, not knowing 
what he would say, not knowing 
what he would do, but, neverthe- 
less, trusting in the Lord. Within 
a few days, I received a letter from 
him, and he relates to me a very 
remarkable healing — I say it was 
remarkable, and yet it was such an 
incident as often occurs in the mis- 
sion field. He said that he and his 
companions were visiting with a 
friend, when a little girl came rush- 
ing into the house and asked the 
elders to go immediately to her 
home and bless a little child that 
was afflicted — a child of non-Mor- 
mon parents. The elders respond- 
ed. When they reached the place 
they found the little one stricken 
down with bronchial pneumonia. 
There was the ma r k of terrible fev- 
er in its eyes, and it was at the 
point of death; in fact, the death- 
rattle was in its throat, and the 
mother was bending over the child 
expecting every moment to see its 
spirit depart for the spirit world. 
The two elders took the child in 
their arms and anointed it with oil, 
and blessed it, and rebuked the dis- 
ease. Relief came instantly ; the 
child rested and was comfortable 
through the night; and when the 
elders came to inquire the next dav 
thev found the little one seated at 
the t^ble. eating an orange, and ful- 
ly recovered. My son goes on to 
say — and th ; s is t^e point I desire to 
emph-siz° — "Father, I laid my 
hands, with mv companion, unoh 
that child, and I saw it healed. I 
know that this could have been 
done only by the power of God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



My faith has been strengthened; 
and this is a testimony to me of 
the truth of the Gospel and he 
adds, "I would) not give it for mil- 
lions of money." That is what mis- 
sionary work does for the Latter- 
day Saint boys who go into the 
field. 

Let me give you another ex- 
ample, which was related by the 
president of the Southern States 
Mission. He said there was a boy 
in his mission who had been afflict- 
ed with deafness; and under the 
administration of the elders, was 
healed, and he could hear clearly 
and distinctly thereafter. When he 
met the president of the mission, 
the latter said to him: "You have 
been healed; have you joined the 
Church?" The boy said, "No, but 
my heart is filled with gratitude to 
God, and I feel that I ought to be- 
long to the "Church." "Well, then," 
said the president of the mission, 
"why are you not a member of the 
Church?" The boy answered. "My 
parents refuse their consent." This 
was an instance where the boy was 
absolutely converted to the truth; 
he had received a great blessing; 
he glorified God in his heart; he 
would have accepted the Gospel, 
and desired baptism; but his par- 
ents flatly refused to give their 
consent. The responsibility is up- 
on them. These examples that I- 
am giving are taken from various 
missions, only one here and there; 
but they might be multiplied in- 
definitely. There was a man in the 
California mission, as related by the 
president of that mission, who be- 
came deeply interested in the Book 
of Mormon. After laying down 
the book, he turned to the Lord in 
fervent prayer. He asked the Lord 
if the Gospel as taught by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints was true, and in a 
vision of the night-time he saw 



the Salt Lake temple, which he 
had never before seen, and his de- 
ceased sister appeared to him and 
explained the ordinance of baptism 
for the dead. A few days later, 
when he came into the mission 
house to attend a meeting there, 
he saw over the pulpit a picture 
of the temple. He immediately said : 
"I know that building; it is the 
temple of God, for I saw it in a 
dream." He came to the elders 
and demanded baptism. The elders 
tried to put him off; they were 
afraid that he was not fully con- 
verted, that he had not had time to 
consider the matter, to know his 
own heart fully. But he said : "No. 
It is true I can't explain the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, but I know by 
the power of God that they are 
true, and I demand baptism. The 
Lord has said that 'if ye will do 
my will ye shall know the doctrine, 
whether it is of God or whether I 
speak of myself.' " He felt that 
by doing the will of God and re- 
ceiving baptism, he would have a 
greater claim upon the Lord for 
light and for understanding. 

Let me give you one other ex- 
ample. It occurred in far distant 
South Africa, among the Boers. 
You have heard of the Boers; you 
will remember the strong defense 
they made in the Boer war, against 
the English; and surely we must 
concede that they are an intrepid 
people, a people of courage and 
fortitude ; and we believe that 
among them will be found the seed 
of Israiel. Two young elders werp la- 
boring among the Boers. Thev 
came into a home where the wife 
could speak English, but theTius- 
band could not speak it, so these 
young- men engaged in conversa- 
tion with the wife. All at once the 
husband snoke up, he spoke in 
Dutch, and addressed his remarks 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

to the elders, who were "unacquaint- 
ed with the language, and they both 
clearly understood what he said; 
and when they answered him in 
English, although he was not famil- 
iar with the English language, he 
understood them. But the remark- 
able thing about it was that when 
the Boer addressed the first elder 
in Dutch, the second elder could 
not understand him, but the fi r st 
elder understood; and when the 
Boer addresed the second elder and 
asked him a question, he under- 
stood him, but the first elder could 
not understand it. This was a very 
remarkable manifestation of the 
power of God in tongues, one of the 
signs that follow the preaching of 
the Gospel. 

I would like to call your atten- 
tion, for just a moment, to some 
things that were accomplished by 
the eighteen hundred missionaries 
during the last year. Usually 
statistics are very dry, but I think> 
you will find these two or three 
items of considerable interest : 
Meetings held in halls in 
the world during 



1908, 38,582 

Cottage meetings 28,968 

Open air meetings .... 13,735 



Total number of meet- 
ings held 81,285 



Gospel conversations . . 1,783,929 



Total meetings and 

gospel conversations 1,865,214 
Standard Church works 

distributed, mostly 

Books of Mormon .. 37,112 
Other books pertaining 

to the Gospel 456,645 

Tracts distributed 9,862,728 



Total books and tracts 

distributed 10,356,485 

This is the work that is going 



on in the world. It is in this way 
that we expect to regenerate the 
world and to accomplish the mis- 
sion that is put upon us by the 
Lord. The great message which 
the angel Moroni delivered to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith is being car- 
ried into the world and distributed 
broadcast. In the Northern States 
mission alone, last year, there were 
over fifteen thousand Books of 
Mormon distributed among the 
people. I bear testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that the 
Book of Mormon is the chiefest of 
all the tracts used by our Elders 
in the mission field. There is no 
tract published by the Latter-day 
Saints that is equal to the Book of 
Mormon, and why? Because the 
Book of Mormon contains the ful- 
ness of the everlasting Gospel as 
taught to the Nephites, and it har- 
monizes with the fulness of the 
Gospel that is taught in the Bible. 

May the Lord bless us. May 
the Lord bless our missionaries. 
We could use a thousand more mis- 
sionaries today if we had them. We 
want young men and older men 
who are efficient; we want them to 
prepare for this work. In the early 
days of the Church, where men 
did not have opportunities of edu- 
cation and of study, the Lord made 
up the deficiency; but in our day, 
when these opportunities are abun- 
dant, the Lord expects the men of 
the priesthood, especially the young 
men of the Church, to take advant- 
age of them and to use their time 
wisely. He expects both old and 
young to attend their priesthood 
meetings, their organizations and 
general meetings, to prepare them- 
selves for missions to the world. 
The Lord bless us, and especially 
bless our young men, to that end, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Sister Esther Davis sang a so- 
prano solo entitled, "Forever with 
the Lord." 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MUKRIN. 

My brethren and sisters,I feel the 
same as other brethren who have 
occupied this position, that is I am 
very dependent upon the help of 
the Lord to enable me to say some- 
thing- that will be of advantage to 
those who have gathered in this 
great building to worship before 
the Lord. My heart has been made 
to reioice in listening to the words 
that have been spoken bv the breth- 
ren who have been called upon to 
-speak in the meetings of the con- 
ference. I thank God, with all my 
heart, that I am numbered with 
the people of the Latter-day 
Saints. My experiences as a mem- 
ber of the Church have brought 
joy, and peace, and very great con- 
tentment to my soul. This joy has 
been particularly strong when I 
have carried out the counsels that 
have been given to me, and have 
most energetically endeavored to 
live in harmony with the principles 
of life and salvation, as revealed 
in these latter times. I feel, when 
joy is produced in the soul of man 
by the doing of things claimed to 
be revealed from the Lord, it is an 
evidence that the thing is right.' 
I do not suppose that any one has 
found any pleasure in the doing of 
things that were not right, things 
that they knew to be wrong. 
Wrong doing produces sorrow and 
not joy; therefore, I say I find joy 
and satisfaction in doing the things 
that are taught in the Gospel as 
presented to the world by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. This joy comes 
with such power and force to me, 
as to be a strong evidence of the 



truth of the Gospel as taught to 
this people. 

I, also, have been impressed very 
frequently, my brethren and sis- 
ters, with the Scripture referred 
to by one of the brethren in re- 
lation to the promises made by our 
Father in heaven in regard to this 
work, even before it was organized, 
that it should be a work of a mar- 
velous character. So far as I 
have become familiar with the 
principles revealed of God to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, I am con- 
vinced that they are indeed mar- 
velous. This work, in its organiza- 
tion and in many of its principles, 
is very different from the churches 
found in the world. We are a 
distinct people, different from all 
other peoples, who profess to be 
followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
One of these differences is that we 
take the position the Scriptures 
teach ; that there is but one means 
of salvation given of God <to the 
human family, and but one church 
that is His Church. 

I will read in support of thia 
proposition a word or two from the 
Scriptures, from the writings of 
the Apostle Paul, a man who was 
filled with the Spirit of the Lord, 
and who wrote many very precious 
things in relation to the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus. He had been 
convinced of the mission of the Re- 
deemer of the world in a marvel- 
ous manner, and he labored ever 
after with very great zeal for the 
spreading of a knowledge of the 
Redeemer's name among the 
children of men. But he discov- 
ered, during his ministry, that some 
men were very unstable, and in- 
clined to turn away from the faith 
of the Gospel. To such men who 
had received the Gospel and had 
been numbered with the people of 
the Lord, but were making ship- 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



97 



wreck of their faith, he wrote, as 
we find in the epistile to the Gala- 
tians as follows: 

"I marvel that ye are so soon re- 
moved from him that called you into 
the grace of Christ unto another gos- 
pel: 

"Which is not another; but there be 
some that trouble you, and would per- 
vert the gospel of Christ. 

"But though we, or an angel from 
heaven, preach any other gospel unto 
you than that which we have preached 
unto you, let him be accursed " 

Mormonism, as I understand it, 
is distinct and peculiar in this re- 
gard, it stands for this one doctrine, 
we do not believe that man can 
find salvation in any way that he 
may elect to find it. We believe 
the Lord of glory has pointed out 
the way, and that He came for 
that purpose. He volunteered to 
accomplish the work that was nec- 
essary in order that mankind might 
be saved. He laid down His life, 
gave His blood, to open up the 
way of salvation, that every soul 
who would believe in His mission 
and in His power to save — a power 
that was in Him by and through 
the accomplishment of the work 
that was given Him of the Father, 
— might be saved. We believe that 
He had the power and authority to 
direct men in the way of salva- 
tion, and that there is no other be- 
ing in the world who can so direct. 
We declare that there never can 
be found, in all the future history 
of the world any other means of 
salvation than has already been 
found and pointed out by the Re- 
deemer of the world. He has 
taueht the doctrine that if any man 
climb uo in any other way than 
the way appointed, he shall be 
counted as a thief and a robber ; and 
so teaches Mormonism. We de- 
clare to the inhabitants of the earth 



that the plan of salvation has been 
revealed anew by the opening of 
the heavens, and by the appearing 
of the Father and the Son to this 
man spoken of so frequently, Jo- 
seph Smith. It is a very startling 
announcement that we make when 
we declare that the heavens have 
been opened, and that authority 
has been given to man by the send- 
ing of angels from the heavenly 
courts, who have conferred upon 
men in these latter times that au- 
thority which they, the angels, re- 
ceived, and exercised when they 
tabernacled here as mortal beings, 
— as we have heard from the 
speakers in this conference. 

As a people, we believe that we 
are living: in the latter days, in the 
day spoken of by the prophets — a 
time that seemed to be of very 
gre->t interest to them, for all the 
prophets, we may sav, have spoken 
of tbe latter davs, and of the won- 
derful things that would be accom- 
plished amonp- the children of men 
in the last dispensation of the Gos- 
pel. As T have said, we believe 
that power and authority have 
he<=n civen afain to man — the au- 
thority of the holv priesthood, 
that authority bv which man min- 
isters in the name of the eternal 
Father, and his ministry is recog- 
nized, sanctioned, and approved by 
the I ord of heaven. It is wonder- 
ful in the ears of those who know 
nothing- of authority, who do not 
believe in the necessity of being 
called of God as was Aaron ; but 
there isn't anything very wonder- 
ful about it when we come to read 
the Scriptures, for men who op- 
erated in ancient times as the ser- 
vants of the Lord, did so by ap- 
pointment from God. We do not 
read that anv of the apostles, whose 
words should be so precious to 
the Christian peoples of the earth

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



today, ever commenced to preach or 
minister in the name of the Master, 
or assumed to perform any of the 
ordinances looking to the salvation 
of the children of men, until they 
had first been selected by the 
Master. They were called from 
their various occupations; they re- 
ceived the laying on of the hands 
of the Redeemer, who taught them 
the doctrine that they had not 
chosen Him but He had chosen 
them, and he had ordained them, 
and He sent them that they might 
bring forth fruit. We believe that 
there never could have been any 
fruit such as the Master had in 
mind, when He spoke these words 
to His apostles, if they had not 
thus been called by His voice, and 
if they had not received this ordina- 
tion that clothed them with power 
and with authority to speak and 
act in His name. The Scriptures are 
full of evidences that all of these 
men were brought into the minis- 
try in this very manner. They did 
not call themselves ; they were not 
called by the people, in any other 
way than has been taught here in 
this conference,God first indicating, 
through the proper channel, the 
men He would have,acting in His 
name, and the people accepting of 
the men so called. 

I say we are a distinct people 
in relation to these matters. We 
believe that there is an absolute 
necessity for men who speak 
and administer Gospel ordin- 
ances, in the name of our 
Father in Heaven, to have confer- 
red upon them the same authority, 
and to be called unto that author- 
ity in the very same manner that 
men were called anciently. Before 
the opening of this dispensation 
men were attempting to act in the 
name of God without being called 
by Him. Because of this there ex- 



isted the necessity of a revelation, 
and of the opening of the heavens 
anew ; for men through unbelief 
had lost all divine authority. They 
did not know anything about it. 
Joseph Smith, himself, did not 
know anything concerning author- 
ity when he went out to plead with 
our Father in heaven, that he 
might be directed in the right chan- 
nel. He expected, I suppose, that 
if answer was given to his prayer, 
that he would be directed to some 
religious denomination. He sup- 
posed, no doubt, that the Gospel 
of Salvation could be found in 
some of the churches; but the Lord 
revealed that men had strayed 
away from the plan that He had 
instituted, that they had broken 
the everlasting covenant, and that 
the time had come for the revela- 
tion again of the Gospel, and anoth- 
er bestowal of that precious au- 
thority. That authority came to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith by the 
ministrations of holy angels sent 
for that especial purpose. Men 
may ask the question, why should 
it come to the Prophet Joseph ? Did 
not men before his time ask God, 
with devout and pure hearts, to 
know the truth? I would say, yes, 
undoubtedly; there have always 
been many good men who have 
shown a disposition to seek God 
for information. Some one may 
wonder why they were not answer- 
ed in the way Joseph Smith claims 
to have been answered, the reason 
is simply that the appointed time 
had not come. We learn in the 
Scriptures that Jesus of Nazareth 
was chosen long before He came 
to minister to mortal man. We al- 
so learn from the Scriptures that 
this was the case with some of 
the prophets; God speaks partic- 
ularly of one of the prophets with 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



99. 



whom He was acquainted. He 
said to the Prophet Jeremiah, "I 
knew thee before thou wast born 
into the world, and I had chosen 
thee and ordained thee to be a 
prophet." No man, no matter how 
devout, could prevent the call of 
Jeremiah. The time had come for 
Joseph Smith in his childhood and 
innocence, to go out into the woods 
and in prayer seek our Father in 
heaven. When that prayer was ut- 
tered it was from the lips' of the 
one who had been chosen to usher 
in a gospel dispensation, chosen 
like Jeremiah, before he was born 
naturally into the world. The an- 
swer was given, because the in- 
strument that had been selected of 
God in the spirit world, had now 
cried unto Him. God heard and an- 
swered the prayer of His servant, 
and gave revelations through this 
great prophet, portraying the mar- 
velous character of the work of the 
latter days. 

We might well ask today, of the 
stranger within our gates, Where 
else in all the world can there be 
found anything like this great 
gathering- of the people of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, who have come here 
from the east, the west, the north, 
and from the south, to serve our 
Father in heaven? It is wonderful. 
It is marvelous. I feel in my soul 
that when men gaze upon this 
great people in their general con- 
ferences, that there comes to them 
the feeling- spoken of in the revela- 
tions: and within themselves they 
say there is something wonderful 
about this people. This great gath- 
ering is of a marvelous character, 
when you think of how these 
masses have come from all the na- 
tions of the earth ; and, yet. how 



united they are; how they see eye 
to eye; how they labor together 
for the accomplishment of the 
Lord's purposes ! My brethren and 
sisters, and friends who may be 
present, what is it? It is the ful- 
fillment of the Scriptures. It is the 
day of God's power. It is the day 
spoken of by the prophets, when 
the Lord God of heaven should set 
His hand to recover His people 
Israel again, when they should be 
hunted from the mountains and 
from the caves, from the dens of 
the earth, and all the earth should 
yield up, according to the decree of 
our Father in heaven, the honest in 
heart. Oh, friends let us under- 
stand ; let us believe, when we see 
this wonderful accomplishment of 
the great work of the latter days 
as spoken of in the prophecies. 
Let us know assuredly that the 
Lord God lives, that He remembers 
His promises, and that He has 
planted His people here according 
to those promises, and He will be 
with them for evermore. May the 
peace of God be upon His people, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Bishop David A. Smith. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. 
m., Tuesday, April 6th. 



THIRD DAY. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

Tuesday, April 6th, 10 a. m. 
Conference was called to order 
- by President Joseph F. Smith. 
The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God; 
Thou hast made Thy children mighty, 
By the touch of the mountain sod. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ne- 
phi Pratt. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations now look up, 

It waves to all the world. 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 

In the Gospel according to Saint 
John, you will find these words of 
the Savior: (John 10:37, 38.) 

"If I do not the works of my 
Father, believe me not. 

"But if I do, though ye believe 
not me, believe the works." 

On the same occasion, He said, 
"Many good works have I showed 
you from my Father; for which of 
those works do ye stone me?" 

We know very well that it is dif- 
ficult indeed for some people to 
understand our doctrine — those 
who do not put themselves in a 
condition to receive it, by doing 
what the Lord has said He requires 



to be done ; by having faith, by re- 
penting, by baptism, by the laying 
on of hands, and by doing those 
things which He has commanded. 
We know how difficult it is for any 
one not of our faith, to judge of 
our doctrine and of our system; 
but it is not difficult for men to 
judge of the works that are accom- 
plished, the results that have been 
produced. 

Another passage of Scripture is 
to this effect: "The things of men 
are understood by the spirit of 
man. hut the thing's of God are un- 
derstood by the Spirit of God." If 
I talk with my non-Mormon 
friend, a^out business affairs, we 
understand each other perfectly, 
because those things are understood 
by the spirit of man. the wisdom 
of man, while the Spirit of God, 
whHi the Savior said He would 
send to His followers, and which 
should lead them into all truth, 
and show them things to come — is 
not usually noticable in the affairs 
of men. I might talk business all 
dav, with friends with whom I do 
business — and I have manv friends 
with whom I am interested in bus- 
iness affairs, who are not members 
of the Church — and we would un- 
derstand each other, I say, oerfect- 
lv, because we understand these 
thines bv the spirit of man. But, 
if- T were to talk faith, if I were 
to talk baptism, or the lavinfr on of 
hands, or the work for the dead, or 
anvtbine of a spiritual nature, to 
the=e same men, it would be like 
talking Greek, I suppose, for it 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIB LEY. 



101 



would be all Greek to the man who 
has not the spirit of it, and who 
does not seek the spirit of it. 

The Savior said, in substance, If 
you can not believe My doctrine 
believe the works. Now, I would 
like to point out a few of the works 
which the doctrines of this Church 
have produced. We read from one 
of the reports, o; it was stated in 
one of our meetings, that this 
Church had assisted poor people, 
many of whom were not members 
of the Church — giving assistance to 
over twenty thousand people dur- 
ing the year 1908. I ask mv friends 
who do not believe as we do, Is not 
that a good work? We have cared 
for our poor, and in doing so have 
expended a large amount of money 
to say notHne: of the amount of at- 
tention and wo'-k and faithful labor 
of our solendid organizations and 
efficient workers in the Relief so- 
cieties, whose work has never been 
counted in dollars and cents, and, 
indeed, can not be estimated in 
dollars and cents. In addition to 
the preat work that they have done, 
dnrins? the past year, the Church 
has p-iven to poor people, as a mat- 
ter of dollars and cents, an amount 
somewhere between $150,000 and 
$200,000. I submit to all candid 
minds this question, Is not that a 
good work? You would not stone 
a man for doinsr that. You would 
not pelt him with epithets, or abuse 
him in any way for eneaging in 
such a charitable work? The work 
is good ; and if you can't under- 
stand the doctrine, there is the 
work, and it speaks for itself. 

Another item : Through their 
faith and desire to worship the 
l ord, to be instructed, admonished, 
counseled and advised, the Church 
brines to this citv everv year thou- 
sands and tens of thousands of its 
members. Not only is this true 



with respect to this city, but it goes 
on to a greater or less extent in all 
the conferences of the Church,, 
here and there, throughout this 
state and adjoining states and ter- 
ritories. Now, I submit to the rail- 
road corporations and to the mer- 
chants and hotel men of Salt Lake 
City and other cities, is not this a 
good work — for you, any how ? We 
ought not to be pelted with epithets 
and be abused, and have contumely 
heaped upon us for putting money 
into your pockets this way, ought 
we? 

I see all the daily papers repre- 
sented here. I would like the report- 
ers to put that question, if they 
will — and I believe they will, as 
fairlv as they can ; for they are 
usually very good fellows. Put that 
que?t ; on fairlv to the people: Is the 
work the Latter-day Saints are do- 
ing in this direction worthv only of 
derision, worthy only of pelting us, 
if not with stones, at least with 
epithets, and hurling contumely 
and ridicule upon us? I ask, 
throup-h the press, ought not this to 
cease? Is it not about time that we 
should have done with all this 
foflv? T recall that in Oliver Crom- 
well's time, when he got tired of a 
certain crowd, in his stern, grave 
wav he said. "Leave off vour fool- 
ing, sir, and come down." I won- 
der, sometimes, whether it will be 
necessary for some modern Oliver 
to auiet these people who mis- 
represent and abuse and wilfully 
malign the Latter-day Saints. They 
not onlv will not believe the doc- 
trine, but they refuse to believe the 
works ; and yet the works are pat- 
ent. I wonder if some modern 
Oliver will not have to say — 
though I am afraid not, for there is 
too much freedom in this age — 
Leave off your fooling, sirs and 
shut up! (Laughter.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In the building up of Salt Lake 
City, look at the work that the 
Church is doing. Look at the meet- 
inghouses that are everywhere be- 
ing built. Think of the work the 
Church has done and is doing in 
redeeming the desert and building 
up the country. This certainly is 
worthy of praise. 

Who are doing most to bring 
strangers to this city and to enter- 
tain them? Right here on this 
temple block, with the efficient ser- 
vices of our workers in our Bureau 
of Information, there is more done 
every year, more done last year, 
and more will be done this year by 
our people than by all others com- 
bined, to entertain strangers. We 
give organ recitals, the most unique 
thing in the world, I suppose, be- 
cause it is all free. I have traveled 
over Europe several times, and I 
know that wherever I went there 
was not anything free; but here 
a man is not allowed to give even 
a five cent piece in return for these 
entertainments and other courtesies 
extended. On this one block there is 
more being done and more money 
spent to entertain strangers and to 
draw strangers to this city than is 
done by all the other agencies, 
boards of trade, and chamber of 
commerce combined. These visitors 
help the railroads, help the hotels 
and stores; they spend their money 
here and help you, my non-Mor- 
mon friends, infinitely more than 
they help us, because we do not 
own the railroads or hotels and we 
own but few of the stores. And I 
repeat there is more done on this 
one block, and more money spent 
to do it, than is done by all other 
agencies combined, in Salt Lake 
City. My friends of the press, is 
not that a good work? And we 
have a right to ask, and do ask, the 
hotel men, the merchants, the rail- 



road managers, whose business is 
benefited in consequence of our 
good works, that they exert 
a united influence to put a stop 
to this everlasting contention and 
abuse. . 

We also help to build up the. 
country around ,us, in colonizing 
and helping poor people to secure 
homes. It is true other states ad- 
joining are building up as well as 
ours, but let it be remembered that 
in 1847 there came here the poor- 
est kind of poverty stricken people. 
There was absolutely no wealth 
among them. The first work done 
by the Anglo-Saxon race in the di- 
rection of irrigation was done right 
here, under the direction of Brig- 
ham Young, near the spot where 
the Salt Lake Theater now stands. 
From that little beginning there has 
grown the wonderful system which 
we now witness, throughout the 
west, as a result of the labors of 
the men of the west. That surely 
is a good work. 

Elder David McKay said, the 
other day, our people have been 
builders. We have not destroyed; 
we have not torn down. The Lord 
said long ago, that He would bring 
His people to the tops of the 
mountains, and He would make the 
wilderness like Eden, and the 
desert like the garden of the Lord; 
that therein should be joy and glad- 
ness, thanksgiving and the voice of 
melody. I say we have redeemed 
the desert and built up the waste 
places and there is more of joy and 
gladness, more of thanksgiving and 
the voice of melody and song, 
among this people here in their 
mountain homes than you will find 
among any other like number of 
people in all the world. This, too, 
is in fulfilment of the prediction of 
the prophet of old. Is not that a 
good work? If you can not be-

lieve the doctrine, I say again, be- 
lieve the works. We say, in busi- 
ness, "Money Talks." Well, works 
talk, and they should not need a 
tongue to speak for them. 

For which of these good works 
that we do, are we ridiculed and re- 
viled? It ought not to be so. We 
are here, my friends and neigh- 
bors, to live together. This is our 
country; this is your country. We 
ought to cease our strife ; we ought 
to cease contention and join to- 
gether and build up the country. 
Our religion is a serious thing with 
us; it can not be changed, and it 
will not be changed. It has been 
repeated here many a time and oft, 
during this and other conferences, 
that this organization, this spiritual 
force which the Lord God Al- 
mighty has set in motion, and 
which He revealed to His servant 
Joseph Smith, the prophet in this 
dispensation, is a spiritual force 
and power which the world needs 
for regeneration. It makes for the 
establishment of ideal homes, as 
was said here, the other day, there 
is more sacredness of the home 
here amon" the Latter-day Saints, 
and there are more people who own 
their own homes here also than 
anywhere else in the world. Presi- 
dent Smith does not own the homes 
of the Mormon people. I have 
heard non-Mormons enlightening 
their friends — this is several years 
ago, however — I have not heard it 
for quite a number of years; but 
several years ago, I heard one fel- 
low enlightening his friends, and 
he said, "Why, everything these 
Mormons have on earth is owned 
by the Church, and the leaders of 
the Church tax the people and tithe 
them, and so on, all to build up 
the President of the Church." Now, 
everybody knows that is all non- 
sense ; everybody, who docs not 



want to lie, knows it ; and even the 
liar knows it is nonsense and not 
true. There are more people in 
the Mormon Church who have 
been helped, here and there in every 
way, by this wonderful organiza- 
tion, the Mormon Church, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, than by any other or- 
ganization I know of; and there 
are more of our people who own 
their own homes than among any 
similar number of people in all the 
world. I ask again, is not that a 
good work? And in those homes 
there has been laid down, for the 
husband and the wife, the same law 
of righteousness; namely, that 
while the wife must be pure and 
clean, the same law applies with 
equal and binding force upon the 
husband. Under this law of the 
Gospel, there is not a whit more 
exacted from the woman than from 
the man. It is required that he, 
too, shall remain pure. Our peo- 
ple are building homes of that 
kind. Where there is impurity men 
are dealt with by the Church; and 
the women are labored with and 
dealt with, if there are lapses. Of 
course, it would be folly to claim 
perfection. We are not perfect; 
we are as other people — Only not 
quite so bad; that is all. (Laugh- 
ter). I recall at this moment an in- 
cident in connection with the Reed 
Smoot investigation, when he tes- 
tified, as thousands of men in Is- 
rael can testify, that he had been 
true to his marriage vow, and that 
he had never had association with 
any woman in the world, except 
only his wife. A very distinguish- 
ed senator, I am told, facetiously 
remarked that he did not know but 
what he ought to object to Reed 
Smoot on that account, because he 
was afraid it would make class dis- 
tinctions in the Senate. (Laughter.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We are glad to have the thou- 
sands of our visiting friends come 
here. We will have, this year, 
probably two hundred thousand 
people register at our Bureau of 
Information. We give them, as I 
have told you, the best there is. We 
have provided for free organ re- 
citals every day. These recitals 
bring many people into this city 
every year, and we are trying with 
our conferences and with other 
means, not only to build up the 
Church, as a church, as a spiritual 
force, but to build up the countrv. 
We welcome these people. We 
welcome the Grand Army and 
those who will pass through the 
city on their way to the Fair at 
Seattle. They will all be made 
welcome, so far as the Church can 
spend means and labor to enter- 
tain them. 

I say that all these things, and 
many more that I have not time to 
mention — are good for there are 
many good works that could be 
mentioned. This is not theory, it is 
not doctrine alone, it is works, and 
thev are grood and they should en- 
title us to something more than 
abuse. 

May the Lord bless this work. I 
propose, by His help, that we stand 
by it, and that we not only ap- 
preciate the works that are accom- 
plished, but with all our hearts 
and souls and our faith in every 
way before the Lord, we say in 
our hearts, it is good to serve the 
Lord. This work is good. The 
spiritual part is better, infinitely 
better than the temporal part — but 
the temporal part, men can see 
and understand, but they can not 
understand the spiritual part. We 
who have tasted of that spirit 
know ; we know of the doctrine. I 
know that this is the work of God, 
and you know it. I recall an inci- 



dent — Brother Penrose relates that 
when he was about to leave Eng- 
land, coming to Zion the first time, 
he was around bidding his old 
friends goodbye. There was one 
old English lady, to whom he was 
attached, who cried and said she 
was sorry she could not go; and 
when he was going, she said: 
"Brother Penrose, when you gets 
to Zion, you tells Brother Brigham 
I knows Mormonism is true just 
as well as he do." Tha t is the 
foundation upon which Mormon- 
ism is built — this individual tes- 
timony that every one knows the 
spiritual side of it as well as the 
temporal side. My time has ex- 
pired. God bless you. Amen. 



PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

The people enjoined to be true Latter- 
day Saints.— Personal remembrances 
of early history. — Passing away of 
old friends. — Necessity for giving 
heed to Spiritual Monitor. — Proper- 
way to pay tithing. 

My Brethren and sisters: I was 
in hopes that this task would oass 
over; for preaching, as I have said 
many times, is not my forte. How- 
ever, I trust that by your faith and 
prayers my memory may recc've 
strength, that something mav come 
to my mi"d that I may sav, which 
will benefit both vou and me. 

I have listened attentively to all 
that h^s been said, thus far, dur- 
ing this conference, and I can in- 
dorse every sentiment, every word, 
for I know all that h^>s b°en said 
has been inspired by our Fatber in 
heaven. We as a people shouH en- 
deavor to be true Latter-day Saints ; 
If we are not, we certainly should 
be. We should realize our duty 
and privileges and strive diligently 
to live in a way and manner that 



PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH.

our Father in heaven will approve 
• so that He may be pleased to let 
His Spirit rest upon us, that those 
who adchess us may speak by that 
Spirit, by that intelligence, that we 
who listen may obtain wisdom and 
knowledge, and that we may re- 
member and profit by what we have 
heard. 

In my reflections, my mind often 
goes back to early youth, to my 
childhood. I can remember back 
farther than many others who are 
here present, in regard to the trav- 
els of the Church. My memory 
goes back as far as Kirtland, Ohio. 
I remember when we were leaving 
there, our travels to Missouri, the 
persecutions through which we pas- 
sed in Missouri, and being driven 
from there to Illinois. My mind is 
very vivid on these points. I remem- 
ber our arrival in Quincy, Illinois, 
and proceeding to the place where 
was afterwards established the city 
of Nauvoo. I remember distinctly 
that the place where we settled, first 
n?med Commerce, but subsequently 
called Nauvoo, was a sickly place ; 
many of us were sick for a year. 
There was a time there when corn 
was only ten cents a bushel, but 
ftisnv of us who had the ten cents 
could not get the corn, because so 
many were sick ; and few were able 
to go out and purchase and take it 
to the mill, in order that we might 
obtain the food needed. My mem- 
ory also goes ba<~k to the time we 
we r e crossing the plains ; finally 
setth'ng here when this country was 
covered with sagebrush, and there 
were no houses to speak of. Often, 
in my reflections, I look around for 
tho^e whom I call, in my way of 
sneaking, the old boys of my youth. 
Thev are getting scarce and, in 
looking around, I oftentimes feel 
lonesome. For many years I have 
tried to get here to conference 



meetings early in. the day, that I 
might shake hands with old per- 
sons with whom I was acquainted 
in early times. But, they are getting 
scarce ; it causes me to realize that 
time is gomg, and that the people 
are being gathered from the earth 
to the spirit world. 

I have been interested in the ad- 
vice and instructions that have been 
given here in regard to closing 
saloons, and urging our people to 
live moral and upright lives ; I real- 
ize that this is a necessity. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints, we should strive to 
live in that way and manner that 
our Father in heaven can bestow 
His blessings upon us. We under- 
stand that it is our duty to pay our 
tithes and offerings ; that we should 
attend to our prayers, and perform 
the many other duties that devolve 
upon us. I have said many times, 
every litter-day Saint has a moni- 
tor within him. If we will stop to re- 
flect upon our duties and privileges 
this monitor will direct us in the 
true path. I believe there is no 
person who does a wrong but what 
that mon : tor within him will say 
that *'t is wrong, and that he should 
not have done it. If we happen to 
get under an influence which is not 
proper and rieht, and permit that 
influence to guide us, we will often 
err in judgment and do things that 
we ought not to do; but if we will 
listen to the promptings of that 
monitor, and take a stra : ghtforward 
course, asking our Father to assist 
and guide us in our labors, we will 
not so often make mistakes. 

I have learned by observation, 
and also by practice, in. regard to 
the law of tithing, to which some 
of the speakers have referred, that 
if we pay our tithes and offerings 
at the time we have the means, it is 
no hardship ; but if we neglect pay- 
ment one month after another the 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



means will be spent ; and then, 
when we should pay tithing, taxes 
come upon us, and when we pay 
the taxes we have no moneyleft for 
tithing. If we will do our duty in 
this regard, and pay as we go, we 
will be all right. This reminds me 
of a little circumstance that trans- 
pired not long ago. I went into a 
store to buy something. The clerk 
said, "Shall I charge it?" I said, 
"No sir; if I can't pay now for 
what I want, I will go without till 
I have the money." This practice is 
the best. If we have not the means 
on hand to buy what we want, 
wait until we can pay for it. If we 
as Latter-day Saints will strive in 
this wise to live up to our duties 
and privileges, asking our Father 
in heaven to guide us each day, we 
will not often err in judgment. 

May the favor of our Father rest 
upon all Israel, and guide us in 
the true faith, qualify us for every 
duty, that we may be worthy of 
the blessings He has in store for us, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ELDER SOREN RASMUSSEN. 

(Late President of Scandinavian 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
very thankful for this privilege and 
opportunity of addressing this large 
assembly. I have rejoiced exceed- 
ingly in the various sessions of the 
conference, and in the spirit that 
has been made manifest in our 
gatherings. During the few mo- 
ments that I shall stand before you, 
I desire that I may be filled with 
the Spirit of the Lord, that I may 
be able to say something that will 
be of benefit to you as well as my- 
self. 



I have been away, laboring in the 
Scandinavian mission, for nearly 
three years, and I can assure you 
that I feel very happy to again as- 
semble with the Saints of God. 
However, I must say that I have 
had a blessed time. The Lord has 
been with me; He has encouraged 
me in my labors, and I have re- 
joiced exceedingly in being a hum- 
ble ambassador of Christ. 

I wish to say that the Scandi- 
navian mission embraces, now.Den- 
mark and Norway, there being 
three conferences in each of these 
countries. We have about 140 eld- 
ers laboring there, and I may say, 
with Brother Baliff, that we could 
use more if we could get them. 
There is plenty of room, and we 
find that our elders are received 
very kindly on almost every hand. 
We are not persecuted as they are 
in some countries. The Scandi- 
navian people are, as a rule, a good, 
hospitable, kind people. Our Eld- 
ers are working hard in order to 
get the Gospel to the children of 
men. Our auxiliary organizations 
are in a very fair condition. We 
have twenty-two Sunday schools in 
tbe mission. We have eighteen Re- 
lief societies ; and the Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Im- 
provement Associations are also in 
very good condition. We have a 
little over one thousand enrolled in 
the Sunday schools, one-third of 
whom are outsiders. Nearly one- 
fourth of those who attend the 
Mutual Improvement Associations 
are non-members of the Church. 
Besides those who are members, 
we have a considerable number 
who come to the meeting's, who are 
also outsiders, and great interest is 
taken in these organizations. We 
have tried to encourage them along 
in these lines, having- been so in- 
structed by the general authorities 
of the Church, realizing that it is of 



ELDER SOREN RASMUSSEN. 



107 



great benefit unto the young peo- 
ple to get them started aright in 
their youth. I call to mind an in- 
stance which came under my ob- 
servation while laboring in that 
mission. I had made the acquaint- 
ance of a young girl and her par- 
ents, who were not members of the 
Church. I labored with this fam- 
ily, along with other Elders, while 
on my former mission, and we en- 
couraged the parents to send their 
little children to our Sunday school. 
When I now returned to the mis- 
sion field and visited this family, 
they were still outside the Church. 
The girls are now young ladies. I 
saw them and talked with them, 
and one day when I was talking to 
one of them, I said, "Would you be 
kind enough to answer me one 
question?" She said, "Yes, indeed." 
"Then I want to ask you, is there 
not something within your heart 
that draws you back to our Sunday 
school and to our people? Answer 
me candidly." She said, "Yes, there 
is ! I do feel as though I want to 
mingle with you yet." She stayed 
away owing to the influence of her 
parents. Although they were 
friendly, they opposed her becom- 
ing: a member of any of our or- 
ganizations; otherwise we should 
have had her a member of our 
choir and, no doubt, other organi- 
zations. Thus I have observed, in 
many instances, that the good seed 
sown in the heart of the child and 
young people does not leave them, 
but, if they are honest with them- 
selves, it will in time lead them 
back to the pale of the Church — 
at least, such is my opinion. 

Our treatment by the officials of 
those countries is splendid. They 
are kind to us ; and we have re- 
ceived no persecution. In the land 
of Norway we were able to hold 
funeral services in the chapels, just 



the same as their own members 
could do; for this we were thank- 
ful indeed. I may say that we had 
the Spirit of the Lord with us when 
we were congregated in these chap- 
els; and more than once I have 
heard people exclaim that ours 
were the finest funeral services they 
had ever attended. As a rule, after 
we had held our little meeting or 
services at the chapel, we would 
congregate at the grave. We would 
dedicate the grave and sing one or 
two hymns. I may say that, as a 
rule, we had excellent singers; the 
Spirit of the Lord was with them, 
and they sang from the heart. The 
singing, and other parts of our ser- 
vices, seemed to have a good effect 
upon the people who witnessed the 
ceremonies. A short time before 
I was released^ we had a funeral 
in our own hall in Copenhagen ; the 
president of the Relief society had 
passed away. There were in at- 
tendance many people who were 
not of our faith, people who were 
prominent in that city, and they 
told me that never in their lives 
had they witnessed a funeral that 
was so impressive. 

I have alluded to the free condi- 
tion in Norway. I am very happy 
to state that the same condition ex 
ists in Denmark today. We are 
able to hold funeral services, to 
speak at funerals, to have singing, 
and to dedicate the graves. We are 
ver v glad for this privilege. I am 
also pleased to state that we have 
some influential people who are 
members of the Church. Perhaps 
there are many here who know 
Brother Samuelsen, who is a mem- 
ber of the Danish Riksdag. He has 
done his part in framing laws that 
have been passed. We have other 
prominent people in those lands 
who are members of the Church; 
and there are very many nice peo- 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pie who are investigating the Gos- 
pel. The elders, as a rule, are per- 
forming a noble work. Of course, 
it may be said that we are not able 
to accomplish as much as they are 
in some lands, for the reason that 
our people are more scattered. For 
example, in Norway there are 
hundreds of inhabited islands, so 
you can readily understand that it 
is impossible to reach all tho;e isl- 
ands. At our last fall conference, 
one pair of elders reported that 
they had visited forty islands, call- 
ing at every house, every family. 
Another pair reported that they had 
visited nineteen islands. There is 
great hardship attached to these 
visits, because many of the island 
boats make only one trip a week, so 
that when the elders go there they 
have to remain a week, whether 
there is much to do or not. As a 
result, we are not able to do quite 
as much as might be done if the 
people were closer together. I wish 
to sav, however, that the elders are 
working very faithfully and zeal- 
ouslv. I congratulate the parents 
and the wives of those noble men 
who are performing such excellent 
work. 

My brethren and sisters. T do not 
wish to occuov any more of your 
ti^e. I rejoice in this treat and 
glorious work, and I hope I may 
be able to continue in the line of 
duty that will lead back to eternal 
life. I know for a surety that God 
lives, that Tesns Christ is the Re- 
deemer of the world, and that Jos- 
eph Smith is indeed a prophet of 
the hving God. T know t^at the au- 
thorities who lead this Church to- 
dav have been called of God. My 
brethren and sisters, let us keep 
in line with the priesthood, and let 
us do our dutv : let us be workers 
in very deed. The Lord bless you, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Zeal and faithfulness of missionaries 
commended. — The Gospel imparts joy 
and peace to its adherents. — Enemies 
of God's work foiled and. forgotten. — 
Evidence of Hebrew origin of Ameri- 
can Aborigines. — Intellectual advance- 
ment among young Latter-day Saints. 
— Difficulty experienced in refuting 
lies. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having 
the opportunity of meeting with 
the Latter-day Saints in this con- 
ference, and I have been pleased 
with the remarks that have been 
made. Many reflections have passed 
through my mind while listening 
to the words that have been uttered 
in our hearing during this confer- 
ence. I have but one desire, and 
it is the desire I have always had, 
and hope I may always have while 
standing before the people, it is that 
I may say that which shall be for 
their best good. 

I have rejoiced, particularly, in 
the testimonies which have been 
borne by our brethren who /have 
been out preaching the Gospel. It 
always seems to me that when men 
return to us from foreign missions, 
if they have been faithful and ener- 
getic, there is a spirit that attends 
them in speaking to the people that 
is rather above the average. I re- 
joice in the burning testimony of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which 
every faithful returned missionary 
possesses. When I think of the five 
years Brother Baliff has spent in 
Belgium, and in the Swiss and Ger- 
man mission, and the zeal he has 
manifested in this work; then, 
when my mind goes over to Japan 
and I think of the eight years, next 
July, since Brother Alma O. Tay- 
lor left us, and seven years in June 
since Brother Fred A. Caine left; 
when I think of their continued dil- 
igence, faithfulness and willingness 
to serve God my heart goes out in 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



109 



blessing to these young men. When 
I think of the far off land of Tur- 
key and realize what a very dif- 
ficult and hard mission it is, and 
think of Brother Wilford Booth 
and his companions, who have la- 
bored there for five long years, my 
heart goes out in blessing to them. 
And when I realize the joy, hap- 
piness, and peace that every faith- 
ful Latter-day Saint experiences, 
who has proclaimed this Gospel, my 
heart goes out in deep gratitude to 
God for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
which you and I have espoused, 
and for the sweet influence of His 
Holy Spirit which ever accompan- 
ies us, which ever attends and 
strengthens us when we are in the 
line of our duty. Surely it does 
require the Spirit of God to un- 
derstand, appreciate and feel grate- 
ful for the Gospel. The world 
knows not of the joy, peace and 
haopiness that is experienced by 
the humble elders who go forth 
with zeal and energy to proclaim 
the Gospel. Some of the sweetest 
moments of my life have been in 
the priesthood meetings of the eld- 
ers, when out in the world pro- 
claiming the Gospel, when tears of 
jov have filled the eyes of every 
man assembled in those meetings. 
As I listened today to the report 
from the Scandinavian mission, I 
remembered one of the finest, one 
of the sweetest spirited meetings 
that T ever attended in my life. It 
was held in Christiania, where our 
brother, who has just been speak- 
ing, was laboring at the time, this 
was before he was called to preside 
over the Scandinavian mission. 
Also, as I listened to Brother Bal- 
iff. I remembered one of the loveli- 
est conferences of the Swiss and 
German Elders that it was ever my 
privilege to attend ; it lasted two . 
davs, and was held in Zurich. T re- 
joice, beyond my ability to tell, in 



having partaken of some of the 
spiritual blessings that come to 
every man who is striving to serve 
God in this Church and kingdom. 

I rejoiced exceedingly in the 
remarks of Brother Nibley, because 
the test he gave is the one by which 
the world, as well as our people, 
will be judged, viz, by their works. 
The Savior laid down the rule that 
by your works shall ye know them. 
From the day that the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ was re-established up- 
on the earth,through the instrumen- 
tality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
until the present time, the works of 
the Latter-day Saints have been 
above reproach. I have often re- 
marked that while the reputation 
of the Latter-day Saints is bad — 
because of the lying, the misrepres- 
entations, and the falsehoods of our 
enemies — I rejoice that the char- 
acter and works of true Latter-day 
Saints are above reproach, and that 
the life of every true Latter-day 
Saint is a bright and shining light 
worthy of the imitation of all men. 

I find recorded in the Doctrine 
and Covenants a very short pas- 
sage which reads: 

"I the Lord am bound when 
ye do what I say; but when ye do 
not what I say, ye have no prom- 
ise." 

I wish that every Latter-day 
Saint would remember these few 
words How I wish that they were 
engraven upon our memories and 
upon our hearts, and that we would 
determine that God shall be bound 
to fulfill His promises unto us, be- 
cause we will keep His command- 
ments. There is a law irrevocably 
decreed in heaven — so we are told 
by the Prophet Joseph — before the 
foundations of the world, upon 
which all blessings are predicated, 
and when we receive any blessing, 
it is bv ohdience to the law upon 
which it is predicted. If you and I de- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sire the blessings of life, of 
health, of vigor of body and mind; 
if we desire the destroying angel 
to pass us by, as he did in the days 
of the children of Israel, we must 
obey the Word of Wisdom; then 
God is bound, and the blessing shall 
come to us. If you and I desire 
that the windows of heaven shall 
be opened, that God shall pour out 
such a blessing upon us that we 
will hardly be able to contain the 
same, then you and I must pay 
tithing; then God is bound to give 
us that blessing. If we desire that 
we shall have influence over our 
children, so that they shall grow 
up with a disposition to love God 
and keep His commandments, so 
that they shall have the spirit of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we 
must remember this command- 
ment: "And again, inasmuch as 
parents in Zion or in any of her 
stakes that are organizd, teach not 
their children to walk uprightly 
before God, the sin shall be upon 
the heads of the parents." If we 
desire the Spirit of God, so that 
we can teach our children and in- 
spire them, we must obey that law. 
So with all the requirements that 
are made of us as Latter-day 
Saints. 

I listened with interest to the 
brief remarks that were made here 
by Brother Winder. He read to 
us one of the verses of that beau- 
tiful hymn by Sister Eliza R. 
Snow. As he was reading it, I 
thought to myself, the third verse 
impressed Brother Winder, but the 
fourth verse is the one that im- 
prssed me; therefore, I will read 
it. 

'What though our rights have been 
assailed ? 
What though by foes we've 
been despoiled? 



Jehovah's promise has not failed, 
Jehovah's purpose is not foil- 
ed." 

Our enemies have never done 
anything that has injured this work 
of God, and they never will. I 
look around, I read, I reflect, and 
I ask the question, Where are the 
men of influence, of power and 
prestige, who have worked against 
the Latter-day Saints? Where is 
the reputation, for honor and cour- 
age, of the governors of Missouri 
and Illinois, the judges, and all 
others who have come here to Utah 
on special missions against the Lat- 
ter-day Saints? Where are there 
people to do them honor? They 
can not be found. Where are the 
people to do honor to T. B. H. 
Stenhouse, who wrote a book pur- 
porting to tell all about the Mor- 
mons, and who did not have the 
courage to sign his name to the 
book, but hid behind the petticoats 
of his wife, by attaching her name 
to the book. (Laughter.) Where 
are the men who have assailed this 
work? Where is their influence? 
They have faded away like dew 
before the sun. We need have no 
fears, we Latter-day Saints. God 
will continue to sustain this work; 
He will sustain the right. If we 
are loyal, if we are true, if we are 
worthy of this Gospel, of which 
God has given us a testimony, 
there is no danger that the world 
can ever injure us. We can never 
be injured, my brethren and sisters, 
by any mortals, except ourselves. 
If we fail to serve God, if we fail 
to do right, then we rob ourselves 
of the ability and power to grow, 
to increase in faith and knowledge, 
to have power with God, and with 
the righteous. 

I rejoice in hearing the choir and 
congregation sing all four verses of 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



Ill 



the great pioneer song, "Come, 
Come ye Saints." It has been a 
source of regret to me that we 
seldom if ever heard that fourth 
verse. I remember, on one occasion, 
while speaking in this halLI made 
the request that, whenever the 
choir or congregation should sing 
this hymn, that they sing the 
fourth verse. As I listened to the 
remarks of our prophet, I was 
deeply impressed. He asked the 
question, "Are we as faithful, are 
we as diligent as our fathers and 
mothers were?" While that hymn 
was being sung I remembered his 
words; and as we were singing it, 
I asked myself the question, Do I 
feel as did our parents? — 

"And should we die before our 
journey's through, 
Happy day ! all is well ! 
We then are free from toil and sor- 
row too; 
With the just we shall dwell." 

Do we feel that, if we die, all is 
well? Are we living so that if the 
summons should come to us, that 
we are worthy to go back to our 
Heavenly Father, when we leave 
this earth, and be welcomed there? 
Are we so living that we are 
worthy of the blessings we have re- 
ceived? I ask myself the question, 
Am I doing all I possibly can for 
the uplifting not only of myself 
but of my fellows, am I in very 
deed a shining light to the peo- 
ple, by reason of the example I 
set before them? 

In our Sunday School Union 
conference in this building last 
Sunday night, we had one of the 
most glorious meetings I have ever 
attended. Several of the speakers 
were given four minutes each, 
and they were four minutes of 
gem thoughts, each and every one 



of them. The great burden of the 
remarks of all the superintendents 
who spoke to the subject — "the 
needs of our Sunday Schools," — 
was not the need of more system, 
more of this, that or the other, but 
the great need is more of the Spirit 
of the Lord in the hearts of the 
teachers, to give that spirit to the 
children. One of the speakers lik- 
ened this Church, and the people 
working in it, to an electric monu- 
ment, with lights all over it; and 
he asked the question, "Is each one 
allowing his light to shine?" and it 
came home to me. It has been 
said here, by some who have spok- 
en, that we are not doing all we 
can. I do not believe that any man 
lives up to his ideals, but if we 
are striving, if we are working, if 
we are trying, to the best of our 
ability, to improve day by day, then 
we are in the line of our duty. If 
we are seeking to remedy our own 
defects, if we are so living that we 
can ask God for light, for know- 
ledge, for intelligence, and above 
all for His Spirit, that we may 
overcome our weaknesses, then, I 
can tell you, we are in the straight 
and narrow path that leads to life 
eternal ; then we need have no fear. 
I am not afraid of any individual 
ever injuring me, but I am afraid 
that perchance I may fail to do my 
duty, that I may fail to be as faith- 
ful and diligent as I ought to be; 
I am afraid I may fail to use all the 
talents God has given me, in the 
way I ought to use them. 

I rejoice in the work that is be- 
ing accomplished both at home and 
abroad. I rejoice in the manifesta- 
tions of the Spirit of God, that 
come to each and every one of our 
elders who faithfully perform the 
duties devolving upon them. I re- 
joice in the fact that God opens 
the way and prepares the hearts of 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the honest in every land and clime, 
wherever this Gospel of Jesus 
Christ has gone. It is also a source 
of joy and satisfaction to me that, 
in all my journeys at home and 
abroad, wherever I go, wherever I 
mingle with people, I am constant- 
ly receiving additional evidence and 
testimony regarding the divinity of 
this work in wheh we are engaged, 
As I journeyed away from home, 
and as I mingled with people, I 
would feel sorrowful if I had con- 
stantly 1 een finding objections to 
the plan of life and salvation, that 
required exertion on my part to ex- 
plain away. It would be a source 
of regret if I were constantly find- 
ing o 1 stacks in the path, regard- 
ing the divinity of the work of God, 
which we have espoused. But, I 
have never found any such ob- 
stacles : I have never found any- 
thing that needed to be explained 
away : everything points to the 
divinity of the work. 

While listening to the remarks 
of Brother Ivins, referring to a 
book that was written by one of 
our enemies, in which the state- 
ment is made that there is not a 
particle of evidence to show that 
there is any trace of the Hebrew 
arrons? t u e people who anciently in- 
habited this country, and that there 
is no evidence that would go to 
prove that the Book of Mormon is 
true. I was reminded of a little item 
of evidence that came under my ob- 
servation while I was in the City 
of London. A gentleman there, to 
whom a very dear friend of mine, 
Col. Alex. G. Hawes, had given me 
a letter, kindly invited a number 
of newspaper men to his home to 
meet me. I am very sorry that 
the newspaper men declined the 
honor; but I had the privilege of 
meeting with this man and his fam- 
ily, and a few friends, and convers- 



ing with them. One of his friends 
had been a member of the British 
legation at Constantinople, and had 
spent a considerable portion of his 
life there. He had traveled all over 
the holy land, and was familiar 
with the people and their customs. 
Among other things, he said: "Mr. 
Grant, I was astonished beyond 
measure, when I visited Canada, to 
find there oriental patterns woven 
in beads, by the American Indians. 
They were the same patterns that 
were woven in rugs, in the orien- 
tal countries. I have traveled ex- 
tensively, and I had never seen 
those oriental patterns in any part 
of the world except in the holy 
bnd, until I found them among the 
North American Indians. Those 
patterns have been handed down 
for hundreds of years, from gen- 
eration to generation ; they are kept 
in families, and can be found no 
where else ; and how under the 
heavens those Indians, who have 
no connection with the people of 
the holy land, should have the 
same patterns is a mvsterv to me." 
"Well, mv friend," I said, "if I 
were to inform you that the fore- 
fathers of these American Indians 
came from the city of Jerusalem, 
that would explain it, wouldn't it?" 
He reolied, "Well, of course, it 
would." I asked him if he had ever 
read the Book of Mormon. He said, 
"No." "Well, it will be my pleasure 
to send you a copy, and from it you 
will learn that the forefathers of 
the American Indians came from 
Jerusalem." "Well," he said, "that 
explains the mystery; I am much 
obliged for the book." 

Now, the one thing for us to do, 
as Latter-day Saints, is to be loyal, 
to be true, to be patriotic, to be 
honest with God; then we need 
have no fear of what the world 
may say about us. We have the 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



113 



truth, and we know it, thank God; 
we know it, though the world may 
not know it. Let us follow the 
admonition of the Savior, and let 
our light so shine that other men 
seeing our good deeds shall glori- 
fy God. 

I rejoice in the great work that 
is being accomplished by the Young 
Ladies' and Youn- Men's Mutual 
Improvement associations. When 
I realize that there are more than 
fifteen thousand copies a year of 
the Young Woman's Journal sub- 
scribed for by the young ladies, and 
read ; and when I think of the many 
fine articles I have read in that 
monthly masrazine, and know that 
they are read by thousands of peo- 
ple, I realize that it is doing a great 
deal of good. It is also a great 
satisfaction to me to know that 
twelve thousand copies of the Im- 
provement Era are going into the 
homes of the people, and being 
read by perhaps three or four times 
that number of individuals, because 
in every home reached by the Era 
there are an average of three or 
four people who read part or all of 
the magazines. I rejoice when I 
realize that the Manuals that are is- 
sued from year to year, are stud- 
ied by from fifteen to twenty-five 
thousand young men ; and that the 
lessons in the Journal are also 
studied by a great number of young 
ladies. It is a pleasure to note the 
advancement that is being made 
among the people, from an intel- 
lectual standpoint. I am glad to 
note that members are increasing in 
the Young Men's Associations; 
and I have no doubt they are in- 
creasing in the Young Ladies' As- 
sociations ; and a greater interest is 
being taken in the books recom- 
mended from time to time as a 
reading course. Our young people 
are taking advantage of these 



books, and are reading them; I 
rejoice in this. God has promised 
many wonderful things regarding 
this people. We have a marvel- 
ous destiny before us, and are grad- 
ually fitting and qualifying our- 
selves for that destiny. When I 
stop to reflect upon the fact that 
when chosen as a boy, not twenty- 
four years of age, to preside over 
a stake of Zion, I had not spoken 
in public ten minutes at any one 
time in my life,— I rejoice to know 
that today there is hardly a boy or 
girl in their teens who can not 
stand up and preach on the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, from fifteen to 
twenty minutes. Nearly all our 
young people can do this, if they 
have been faithful in attending the 
Mutual Improvement Associations. 

I rejoice in the natural growth 
of the people of God, and in the 
benefits that are coming to us. As 
I listened to the remarks of Presi- 
dent Smith, in his opening address, 
I was reminded of some beautiful 
words that are contained in one of 
the little books recommended by the 
General Board of the Young Men's 
Mutual Improvement Associations. 
If any of you want a copy of it, 
it will cost you only twenty-five 
cents, and a postage stamp. Write 
to President Charles W. Penrose, 
Liverpool, England, and he will 
mail you a copy. Now, I realize 
that there is nothing more tiresome 
to an audience than to listen to a 
man read. I have often been guilty 
of that during the past year, be- 
cause it has happened that men had 
been writing on the subjects about 
which I wished to speak, and what 
they wrote was better than any- 
thing I could say myself. For that 
reason I have been guilty of weary- 
ing my audiences by reading on 
many occasions. But, in the hope 
that by reading a page or two you 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



may be impressed with a desire to 
write to Brother Penrose for a 
copy of the book, I am going to 
weary you for a little while. Broth- 
er N. L. Nelson, of the Brigham 
Young Univeristy, to whom I sent 
a copy of the book with my com- 
pliments, was so impressed with it 
that he read extracts to a number 
of the students in his classes, with 
the result that they sent to Liver- 
pool for one hundred copies. I 
have given away hundreds of copies 
of this book, because it has im- 
pressed me with its worth. I con- 
sider it worth ten — yes twenty 
times twenty-five cents, or the 
twenty-seven cents that it will cost 
to send to England for it. The 
book is entitled "Great Truths." 

"Truth is the rock foundation of 
every great character. It is loyalty 
to the right as we see it; it is courage- 
ous living of our lives in harmony 
with our ideals; it is always — power. 

"Truth ever defies full definition. 
Like electricity it can only be ex- 
plained by noting its manifestation. It 
is the compass of the soul, the guard- 
ian of conscience, the final touchstone 
of right. Truth is the revelation of 
the ideal; but it is also an inspiration 
to realize that ideal, a constant im- 
pulse to live it. 

"For the individual, there is no such 
thing as theoretic truth; a great truth 
that is not absorbed by our whole 
mind and life, and has not become an 
inseparable part of our living, is not 
a real truth to us. If we know the 
•ruth and do not live it, our life is — a 
lie." 

"Let us cultivate that sterling honor 
that holds our word so supreme, so 
sacred, that to forget it would seem 
a crime, to deny it would be impos- 
sible. * * ■ * " 

"With the love of truth, the indi- 
vidual scorns to do a mean thing, no 
matter what be the gain, even if the 
whole world would approve. He would 
not sacrifice the sanction of his own 
high standard for any gain: he should 
not willingly deflect the needle of his 



thought and act from the true North, 
as he knows it, by the slightest pos- 
sible variation. He himself would 
know of the deflection — that would be 
enough. What matters it what the 
world thinks if he have his own dis- 
approval." 

If you and I know the Gospel 
is true, if we know that God lives, 
if we know that this is the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, what do we care 
if the world falsely accuse us ? If 
we are honest, if we are faithful, if 
we are diligent in keeping the com- 
mandments of God, we know our 
heavenly Father and our consci- 
ences will be on our side; and that 
is worth more than the praise of 
the world; if we are not worthy 
of that praise, then we are under 
condemnation before our heavenly 
Father. 

"Faith in Truth is an essential to 
perfect companionship with truth. The 
individual must have perfect confi- 
dence and assurance of the final tri- 
umph of right, and order, and jus- 
tice, and believe that all things are 
evolving toward that divine consum- 
•nation, no matter how dark and dreary 
life may seem from day to day. No 
real success, no lasting happiness, can 
exist except it be founded on the rock 
of truth. The prosperity that is based 
on lying, deception, and intrigue, i? 
only temporary — it cannot last any 
more than a mushroom can outlive an 
oak. Like the blind Samson, strug- 
gling in the temple, the individual 
whose life is based on trickery always 
pulls down the supporting columns of 
his own edifice, and perishes in the 
ruins. * * * " 

While I was in Japan, articles 
were published against us. One 
was an extract from a sermon of 
the late President Brigham Young, 
in which he said. "We have in our 
midst the biggest liars, the meanest 
devils that ever walked on the face 
of the earth ;" so on and so forth. 
That was quoted in the paper. 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



115 



When I sent home and secured a 
copy of the sermon in full, I went 
to the editor of that paper and 
showed him the sequence to those 
words — "But with God's help we 
will cast them out ;" do you think I 
could get fthat paper to publish 
it ? Not a bit of it. Tracts against 
the Latter-day Saints are circulated 
all over the world, clear to Japan, 
with this extract from the sermon 
of Brigham Young, (and those cir- 
culating them know they are mis- 
leading,) without the following 
qualifications: "God knows that 
we have never sustained them, that 
I have never sustained them, that 
I do not approve of them, and that 
we will cast them out." And yet, 
this is one of the weapons that is 
used against us; but it will fail; 
it will fail as such weapons al- 
ways do fail. Accusations like this, 
that are published all over the" 
world, must fail when the truth is 
known. I called on an editor in 
London, who had published about 
ten columns of the vilest kind of 
matter against the Latter-day 
Saints, and asked him to take one 
single column in refutation, and he 
refused it. I presented letters of 
introduction from leading influen- 
tial men in America, stating that I 
was a gentleman of unquestioned 
integrity, and that my word was as 
good as my bond ; but he would 
not take a word from me. He said, 
"We have published all we care to 
publish on the Mormon question." 
I said, "But all you have published 
is lies, and I know it, and I now 
ask you to publish one-tenth as 
much truth." He declined again. 
His name was Robinson. I arose 
and started as if to leave t'tie of- 
fice — I did not intend to go but I 
put my hat on and pretended that I 
was going. I stopped, when I got 
to the door, turned around, and 



again took off my two-story hat, 
and said to him, "My friend, if I 
remember correctly your name is 
Robinson?" "Yes," he said, "that 
is my name." "Did you ever hear 
tell of Phil Robinson?" "Yes." "Is 
he an honest and honorable man?" 
"Yes." "At the time of the first 
great Boer war, was he the cor- 
respondent of the London Daily 
Telegraph, one of your greatest 
newspapers?" "Yes." "Anything he 
would write, would you accept as 
truth?" "Certainly." Then I said, 
"Spend a couple of shillings and 
buy his book, 'Sinners and Saints ;' 
then you will find that everything 
you have published in your paper 
about the Mormons is a lie." He 
said, "You surprise me." I said, 
"You are not the first newspaper 
man who has been surprised, when 
it comes to the Mormon question." 
Then he said, "May be you better 
write us something, Mr. Grant; 
make it brief; don't make it more 
than half a column." Think of the 
liberality of a great newspaper, one 
of the great newspapers of London, 
that had published from seven to a 
dozen columns of lies, and then 
would give only a half column to 
answer. I wrote it — or to be frank, 
I suggested the ideas to Brother 
Richard Shipp, and he wrote it for 
me. I sent the communication to 
them, and I got it back — as has 
been the case with many things 
that I have sent the newspapers — 
with a printed circular stating that 
the editor was very sorry, but he 
did not have room for it. Whenever 
I get one of these circulars I al- 
ways think of the little saying that, 
"Polite lying is a gentlemanly ac- 
complishment; it lubricates busi- 
ness, varnishes unpleasant facts, 
and promotes friendship." 

Aeain quoting from "Great 
Truths" 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"No matter what price a man may 
pay for truth, he is getting it at a bar- 
gain. The lying of others can never 
hurt us long; it always carries with 
it our exoneration in the end" 

"Truth, is not a mere absence of 
the vices. This is only a moral vacuum. 
Truth is the living, pulsing breathing 
of the virtues of life. Mere refrain- 
ing from wrong-doing is but keeping 
the weeds out of the garden of one's 
life. But this must be followed by 
positive planting- of the seeds of right 
to secure the flowers of true living. 
To the negatives of the Ten Com- 
mandments must be added the posi- 
tives of the Beatitudes. The one con- 
demns, the other commends; the one 
forbids, the other inspires; the one 
emphasizes the act, the other the spirit 
behind the act. The whole truth rests 
not in either, but in both. 

"A man cannot truly believe in God 
without believing in the final inev- 
itable triumph of Truth. If you have 
Truth on your side you can pass 
through the dark valley of slander, 
misrepresentation and abuse, undaunt- 
ed, as though you wore a magic suit of 
mail that no bullet could enter, no ar- 
row could pierce. You can hold your 
head high, toss it fearlessly and defi- 
antly, look every man calmly and un- 
flinchingly in the eye, as though you 
rode, a victorious king, returning at 
the head of your legions with banners 
waving and lances glistening, and bu- 
ghs filling the air with music. You can 
feel the great expansive wave of moral 
health surging through you as the 
quickened blood courses through the 
body of him who is gladly, gloriously 
proud of physical health. You *vill 
know that all will come right in the 
end, that it must come, that error 
must flee before the great white light 
of truth, as darkness slinks away in- 
to nothingness in the presence of the 
sunburst. Then, with Truth as your 
guide, your companion, your ally, and 
inspiration, you tingle with the con- 
sciousness of your kinship with the infi- 
nite and all the petty trials, sorrows 
and sufferings of life fade away like 
temporary, harmless visions seen in a 
dream." 

We have truth on our side; we 
have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
God lives ; Jesus is the Christ. Jo- 
seph Smith is a prophet of God; 



and every man who has succeeded 
Joseph Smith has been God's 
mouthpiece. Let us be true to God, 
and God will sustain us. This is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Let 
the mountains shout for joy." 

President Smith called attention 
to the severe storm prevailing out- 
side, and requested the congrega- 
tion to express, by vote, their wish 
as to adjourning now, or continu- 
ing this meeting until the Confer- 
ence is closed. The congregation 
voted in favor of the proposition. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Tribute to strong, honest character of 
President Roosevelt. — prospect for 
continuance of good government — 
Integrity to trust in handling funds. 
— Laxity in discipline of children. — 
The young incited to acquire no- 
bility of character. 

I have listened with intense in- 
terest to the remarks that have 
been made by our brethren, from 
the opening of the conference un- 
til the present time. It has been 
a joy to me to recognize the char- 
acter of the spirit, as well as the 
nature of the words that have 
fallen from the lips of each of the 
speakers. I trust that the impress 
made upon our minds will remain, 
and be a joy to us while engaged 
in the performance of our duties 
during- the next year. 

In looking back over the past 
year, I recognize the fact that the 
bles=ines of the Lord have abound- 
ed in large degree upon this peo- 
ple, as well as upon all other peo- 
ple of the United States, and most 
of the nations of the world. While 
there have been calamities of a ser- 
ious character that have fallen to 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH.

the lot of some of our Father's 
children, enough at least to signify 
unto us that His providences are 
over all, and we realize that His 
judgments may be poured out in 
His own way, and in His own time, 
upon any of us; yet, as a rule, joy 
abounds in the hearts of the child- 
ren of men. 

We have recently noted the 
change of presidents of the United 
States, the passing from the presi- 
dency of this great nation of ours 
one of the most heroic, earnest, 
devoted and thoroughly honest 
men. His efforts toward the refor- 
mation of our land should be a joy 
to every American citizen. While 
he may, in his zeal, have made mis- 
takes, I believe that, in the writings 
of historians of the future, one of 
the brightest names in the history 
of the race will be that of the man 
who has served this nation so faith- 
fully and well — Theodore Roose- 
velt. The coming into power of 
another man as the executive of 
our nation, fully equipped for the 
discharge of his duties, with ex- 
tended experience, and a body of 
able men around him, I believe 
presages to our country continued 
glorious growth and development. 
While it is not my thought to dwell 
upon the question of civil govern- 
ment, it is a joy to recognize the 
fact that the nation in which we 
live, which we love, and which is 
our nation, has demonstrated pow- 
er to carry itself unscathed amidst 
storms and tempests, amidst fin- 
ancial distresses, and make success- 
ful the ministry and labor of its 
noble and gifted sons. 

While I stand here I desire to 
speak briefly upon a subject that 
has not been spoken of at this con- 
ference, by any of my brethren — it 
is the question of financial integ- 
rity, sacred regard for trusts. It oc- 



casionally occurs, as we note in 
publications over the land, that 
men who are trusted with pub- 
lic and private funds go wrong. 
There seems to be a lack of un- 
derstanding in regard to this ques- 
tion of the sacredness of these ob- 
ligations. I hope that within each 
of the schools in our state, whether 
state or church schools, universi- 
ties, academies, colleges, or grade 
schools, that there shall be an effort 
made by the faculties in those insti- 
tutions to impress fully upon the 
minds of our young men the sacred- 
ness that attaches to public and 
private trusts. It is most desir- 
able that the principles of honor, 
honesty, integrity, wisdom, and 
right shall be written in their souls, 
that moral principles may be so 
thoroughly implanted in them, 
through the training they receive 
therein, augmented by the efforts 
and ministry of Sabbath schools 
and the various associations that 
have been established in the 
Church, so that no young man of 
this Church or state, who shall be 
entrusted with the means of an- 
other person, whether it be private 
or public, shall be led to misuse 
those funds, and do that which 
shall bring discredit to his name, 
to his family, or to the people 
among whom he resides. I believe 
that more thoughtful and earnest 
labor is necessary in connection 
with these matters, in our homes, 
schools, and churches, and in the 
various organizations that have 
been established all over the land 
looking toward the betterment and 
uplifting of the sons and daugh- 
ters of this glorious country of 
ours. 

In the priesthood meeting last 
night, President Smith briefly 
made reference to propositions in- 
volved in the stricter guardianship

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of our children, calling attention 
to laxity in governing them, and 
a degree of recklessness that has 
deveioped,along certain lines,among 
some of our young people. From 
my own observation, I feel sure 
that we accord greater liberty to 
our children than is granted by a 
large majority of the rest of the 
world. 1 feel that this matter of 
the care and education of our 
children, needs consideration in 
every home, ward, and stake of 
Zion. As I remarked before, in one 
of the meetings in this Tabernacle, 
I am fearful we are becoming too 
much the lovers of pleasure, and 
too little the lovers of God; I be- 
lieve that repentance and reforma- 
tion in these respects are requisites 
among us as a people. I believe 
that excessive liberty comes into 
my own home ; I know it does ; and 
I believe it goes into the homes 
of too many of this people. While 
in no sense of the word would I 
curtail legitimate and proper lib- 
erty, proper enjoyment and recrea- 
tion for the young, I recognize the 
fact that indiscriminate mingling 
of boys and girls in every place, 
and under every condition, with- 
out the guardianship of parents, is 
a menace to the morality, well-be- 
ing, and good of our young, a 
hindrance to their development 
and growth in the cause of the 
Eternal Father. My brothers and 
my sisters, I ask you to think up- 
on this problem of the proper care 
of our children. Let us instil into 
the minds of our young people, 
who are entering upon the duties 
of life a proper understanding 
and regard for the sacredness of 
those obligations, that they may 
duly recognize the principles of 
virtue, honestv, integrity, honor, 
devotion to the right, industry, 
perseverance and unyielding cour- 



age, with resolutions fixed upon 
the uplifting and upbuilding of the 
race, the betterment of the whole 
world. 

As my brethren have said before 
me, I testify to the mission of the 
Redeemer of the world, the Son 
of the living God. I testify to 
the truth that has been established 
through His administration. I tes- 
tify to the greatness, and to the 
truth in its fullness, of the work 
of the Almighty that has been en- 
trusted to these men and women 
who are under the sound of my 
voice. It is the grandest and truest 
mission that has ever been impos- 
ed upon mortal in the history of 
the world. 

I plead with my brethren and 
sisters to think of these matters, 
that we may understand the obli- 
gations that rest upon us in this 
great work; that we may under- 
stand our duties toward our 
children, that elements of the nobl- 
est character shall be implanted in 
the souls of our sons and daughters 
and that the country in which we 
live shall be uplifted through the 
purity and integrity shown in their 
lives and ministry. Amen. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

I have rejoiced exceedingly with 
you, my brethren and sisters, dur- 
ing this conference. It seems to 
me it has been one of the most in- 
spiring and edifying conferences 
that we have ever enjoyed. The 
weather has been good, and the 
congregations have been large and

119 



attentive. I am sure that we have 
verily been fed spiritually, and in- 
structed, and I am now quite pre- 
pared for the transaction of the re- 
maining business of the conference, 
and for its adjournment. 

The work of the Lord is so 
thoroughly fixed in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints, that it is 
secure among men. It may not 
yet have reached its majority, or 
become strong enough to be very 
remarkable among the churches 
and peoples of the earth, but it cer- 
tainly is so strongly established 
that it will never be shaken, nor 
moved. It will not be moved out 
of its place, for the Lord will sus- 
tain it ; and He will sustain each of 
us, individually, through our faith, 
and having done the will, of the 
Lord. We not only recognize the 
results in the works of the people, 
but we know of the doctrine. The 
Lord has favored us, as He would 
have favored all men if they would 
have received His blessings, if they 
had been willing to listen to the 
truth and receive it. Not that we 
have been any more favored, par- 
ticularly, than the rest of the world 
would have been, if they had been 
willing, if they had opened their 
hearts and their ears, and had list- 
ened. They could have known as 
we know, and they might have real- 
ized the truth of the doctrine, as 
well as to have recognized the good 
works quoted here_ by our bishop. 

We would like them to be able 
to quote a good many more good 
works than we have heard, in con- 
nection with us individually and as 
a people, for there is ample room 
for our improvement. We must 
correct the troubles that we com- 
plain of in regard to our children, 
and that we find in ourselves. At 
times we have to acknowledge that 
we are a little like the world, that 



we stray from our professions and 
the doctrines of life and truth. Un- 
less we are careful, we may depart, 
in some particular, from the 
straight and narrow path. 

Although we have to acknowl- 
edge these things, yet there is be- 
ing established and is established 
now, in the hearts of a large ma- 
jority of the Latter-day Saints, a 
clear understanding of the doc- 
trines that are so difficult for the 
world to comprehend, for the rea- 
son explained by the bishop — that 
they have not the spirit of this 
work, but have the spirit of the 
world. We, too, have the spirit 
of the world in quite liberal 
amount, so that we understand, as 
the world understands, the things 
of the world; we comprehend and 
agree in regard to them, and, like 
the world, we participate more or 
less and are engrossed in that 
spirit more than we should be. We 
should be more thoroughly and 
entirely under the influence and in- 
spiration of the Holy Ghost; but 
we are improving in this regard. 
I say that the Latter-day Saints 
are improving, and I am not sure 
but there is improvement also in 
the world. There are many good 
people in the world, who are right- 
eous, who are humble and faithful 
according to their understanding of 
the truth. 

Our trouble is, much as others, 
we have our agency, and our 
children, fust like ourselves, have 
their agency ; and although we mav 
possibly set before them reasonably 
good examples, and be solicitous 
for them, prayerful and anxious 
for their salvation, yet they take 
their choice — your boys and mine, 
and our girls, they do just about as 
they please. I believe it is general- 
lv understood, and advocated, that 
if we were better parents, better 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fathers and mothers, attended more 
faithfully to our duties in teach- 
ing our children and training them, 
we would have better children. I 
presume there is much truth in 
it ; but sometimes good people, good 
parents, have bad boys and bad 
girls. I understand that the Lord 
has more bad boys and girls than 
anybody else; yet, He teaches, and 
instructs, and inspires, and is ready 
to do everything He. can for them; 
and aren't you and I ready also to 
do what we can for our children. 
Although we may do all that lies 
in our power, set good examples, 
give good instructions, take pains 
to observe the Sabbath day our- 
selves, and have our children do 
the same, yet a percentage of them 
may be reckless, and some may go 
to destruction, and as a result our 
hearts may be broken. Tender 
fathers and mothers are very great- 
ly distressed over the wayward- 
ness, of their children. It is our 
duty to care for our children, to 
look after them, to do all the good 
we can for them, and when we 
have done all that, why some of 
them, no doubt, will be lost — at 
least they will not do as we want 
them to do. They will exercise 
their agency, and some of them 
may listen to the spirit of evil that 
is in the world. Notwithstanding 
these difficulties, it is our obligation 
to take every pains in our power 
for the salvation of our children, 
for they are the children of God. 
They are entrusted to us, and we 
are responsible for teaching them, 
training and leading them by our 
example and precept in the ways 
of righteousness. When we have 
done our duty faithfully, and have 
been perfect, even as our Father in 
heaven is perfect, as near as we 
can — which I believe we can fair- 
ly well be if we will— then the 



responsibility rests upon the 
children themselves. Parents do 
not rest under condemnation when 
they have done their duty in regard 
to their children. The obligation 
rests first with the parents, but it 
also rests upon the bishops and 
presiding officers in the wards, in 
the stakes of Zion, and in the 
Church, the leading presiding 
brethren, and the leading and chief 
sisters in the associations — a great 
responsibility rests upon them as 
well as upon the parents ; they must 
all do their duty, so that the young 
people of the Church may be 
thoroughly trained and instructed. 

Let us take care of what the 
Lord has entrusted to us. He has 
given us everything we enjoy, the 
Church, the people, our families, 
our country. Thank the Lord for 
this country, of which we speak so 
highly, and its government — a 
splendid government, a splendid 
country; and yet there are difficul- 
ties, and troubles in the cities, the 
states and in the nation. We have 
to struggle with great ques- 
tions, great difficulties, but 
we have the finest part of 
the world, the best government, 
and the finest people— for we have 
the very best people of all nations ; 
we have gathered in this country 
from all nations. Ours is a gath- 
ering nation, as well as a gathering 
people. I do not know that there 
is any other nation — I do not think 
just now of another nation that is 
gathering from all the other na- 
tions of the earth. All the nations 
of the earth seem to be contribut- 
ing to build up this nation which 
the Lord seems to have held in re- 
serve; that is, He seems to have 
delayed the establishment of this 
nation, the developing of this side 
of the world. He has reserved this 
country for the accomplishment of 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



121 



His purposes. They are gathering 
to this continent, and they are 
gathering to this people, as to no 
other religious denomination^ We 
have represented here nearly all the 
civilized nations of the earth — if 
they are not all represented now, 
they will be after a little while. 
The choicest element seems to be 
moving from the old world, from 
among other nations, to gather 
upon this new side of the world — 
although it is sometimes regard- 
ed as the old side of the world; it 
has been old so long it seems to 
have come young again. We are 
developing a nation, and we are de- 
veloping a people, religiously, such 
as is not known on any other part 
of the earth. 

Being thus favored of the Lord, 
and being called as His instru- 
ments, it behooves us to be faith- 
ful and diligent. We have been 
called of God; He has inspired us; 
He has opened our eyes and our 
ears, and enables us to understand. 
It seems that He has been unable 
to make others of His children see 
as yet, though their eyes will final- 
ly be opened. Thank the Lord 
that our eyes have been opened ear- 
ly, and that we now have the 
privilege of helping to build up the 
kingdom of God, to spread abroad 
in the earth the principles of truth 
and righteousness, to take care of 
the foundations of this Church 
which the Lord has established in 
our day. 

It is a wonderful thing for us to 
be members of this Church. The 
brethren sometimes say how they 
appreciate their membership in this 
Church. Why, th/ere is nothing 
greater, nothing finer in the world, 
for we are associated with the 
counsels, the directions, and divine 
inspiration and authority off th/e 
Father, to whom all men are ac- 



countable. He inspired His prophet 
Joseph Smith, to lay the founda- 
tions of this work, so securely that 
it will never be disturbed; that is, 
it will never be overturned ; and the 
work will never be given to an- 
other people,for the people who now 
possess it, and their posterity, and 
those who come to our assistance, 
will sustain this work, and it will 
never be overthrown, for God has 
said it. He is sustaining and di- 
recting this great work. You and 
T are His instruments, and we will 
be wondefully honored and blest in 
our salvation, and the salvation of 
our posterity, if we are faithful. 
Let us do our duty ; da it faithful- 
ly, thoroughly, and well, so that we. 
shall never be condemned, nor be 
ashamed — through Jesus Christ, 
our Lord. Amen.

CLOSING REMARKS. 

Faithful Elders who have died recently 
in mission fields. — The blessings of 
heaven invoked on the Saints. — Ad- 
monition to serve God. 

It is with feelings of great sym- 
pathy, on the part of the brethren 
who preside, and the Saints every- 
where, that I have to announce 
that since the October conference 
the following deaths have occurred 
in the mission field : 

Brother Charles Mortenson, of 
Koosharem, Utah, died in Scan- 
dinavia, on January 12, 1909 ; cause 
appendicitis. 

Brother George Edwin Morris, 
of Mesa, Arizona, died December 
12, 1908, in Samoa; cause, sun- 
stroke. 

Brother Oliver Hansen, of Bear 
River City, Utah, died November 
28, 1908, in Scandinavia; cause, 
leakage of the heart. This brother 
died at Chicago while en route 
home from his mission. 



We felt that it was our duty to 
mention the names of these our 
brethren who have fallen in the 
ministry, while devoting their time 
and the gifts the Lord bestowed 
upon them, in the mission field. 
They were faithful and true, and 
their memories should ever be held 
clear by their kindred and all the 
Latter-day Saints, in that they laid 
down their lives in the Master's 
service. We pray God to bless and 
comfort those who are bereaved 
more especially by their loss ; and 
their hearts may not faint, but that 
they may be buoyed up in the hope 
of the glorious resurrection await- 
ing them when they and their loved 
ones shall, be reunited in the life 
and light which will never perish 
or again grow dim. 

I desire to express my gratitude 
to the Latter-day Saints who have 
so faithfully attended this confer- 
ence. I feel to give to you, my 
brethren and sisters, my blessing, 
and to ask humbly of the Lord to 
bestow greatly upon you all His 
favors, His blessings and protect- 
ing care, that you may be prosper- 
ed in your temporal labors, and that 
you may also be prospered abund- 
antly in your spiritual labors and 
efforts to build up the kingdom of 
God in the earth. I trust that we 
may all return to our daily duties 
rejoicing in the spirit that has been 
manifested during our conference 
and in the excellent instructions 
and counsels that have been given 
to us by those who have spoken. 
Let us bear these things in mind, 
and go home determined more than 
ever to serve God and to keep His 
laws ; to work righteousness in the 
earth, that our light may indeed so 
shine that the world may see it, and 
that men may be led to glorify God. 

It was announced that Prof.

John J. McClellan, and assistants, 
will give recitals at 12 m. daily 
hereafter, on the great Tabernacle 
organ, to which the public will be 
admitted free, as heretofore. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays ; 
We thank Thee for every blessing 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder John G. McQuarrie, and 



Conference was adjourned for six 
months.

gation at all the conference meet- 
ings in the Tabernacle, and Prof. 
John J. McClellan played the ac-

God's Kingdom on earth to unite with the Heavenly Kingdom. — Conditions essential to admission into the Kingdom. — Faithful Saints sustained by the Hob' Spirit. — Evil is overcome by resistance. 

It is nearly time to bring our meeting to a close. I feel that we have had a good service. I can bear testimony to the truth of what has been said this afternoon. 

I desire, in the few moments that remain, to express some sentiments which I have in my heart with regard to this work. We have in the 65th section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants a revelation on prayer, given through the Prophet Joseph, the Seer, in the year 1831. From this revelation I read the following : 

"The keys of the kingdom of God  committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which was cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth until it has filled the whole earth; yea, a voice crying, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, prepare ye the supper of the Lamb, make ready for the bridegroom; pray unto the Lord, call upon His holy name, make known His wonderful works among the people; call upon the Lord, that His kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down from heaven, clothed in the brightness of His glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth; wherefore may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, for ever. Amen.

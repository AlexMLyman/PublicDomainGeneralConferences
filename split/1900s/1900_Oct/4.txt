Individual Re=ponsibtiity of the Saints— Neglect of duties of the Priesthood deprecated— Baneful effects of bad example— Officers should be wisely selected— Saints . should not take their hands from the plow. My beloved brethren and sisters: I feel very grateful this afternoon that the Lord is mindful of his people. I thank him for the prosperity that is attending the Latter-day Saints, for the liberty that we enjoy, and for the marvelous way in which he has operated upon the people in many sections of the earth to bring about the freedom that his servants enjoy today. In standing before you this afternoon I feel very humble, and I pray that the power and inspiration of God may rest upon me that I may be led to give forth the words that he would have me speak on this occasion; for he knows the hearts of this people and the teachings that will be best adapted to their needs. I have greatly enjoyed the instructions that have been given here today. I do not know that I ever heard President Snow speak when his voice sounded clearer or more forceful than it did this morning, and this reminded me of the change that ofttimes comes over men when they are called of God to certain positions. In many instances their bodies and their minds seem to be renovated and renewed by the power of God within them. I felt in listening to President Snow's words to glorify the name of our Eternal Father for his goodness and for the abundant manifestations of his approval of this people. 

There is a matter that I have thought of a great deal of late in connection with the work of our Heavenly Father, and that is the individual responsibility which the Latter-day Saints are under. I doubt very much if in our different callings we appreciate this as we ought  do. There is too great a tendency on the part of those who bear the Holy Priesthood to try to shift responsibility onto the presiding officers of the wards or the Stakes or the Church. Did we ever think of the fact that every one of us should be as interested in the work of God as our brother or our sister? We ought not to try to shift responsibility onto some one else; but we ought to secure a clear conscience before God by faithfully discharging the duty whereunto we have been called, be that duty ever so humble. 

Every quorum of the Priesthood is necessary in the Church of Christ. If it were not, it never would have been given to us. I have been alarmed at the disregard of duty shown by many men who have been honored with the Priesthood of the Son of God. Especially is this the case in the Lesser Priesthood, and in many instances it is to be found among the Elders and Seventies. This ought not to be. I feel that we will never arrive at the condition which we would like to attain until there is a renewal of interest in all the quorums of the Priesthood. Our heavenly Father has placed each quorum in the Church to perform an especial labor. The duty of the Deacon is different from that of .he Teacher, the duty of the Teacher is different from that of the Priest, the duty of the Priest is different from that of the Elder, the duty of the Elder from that of the Seventy, the Seventy from that of the High Priest, and the High Priest from that of the Apostle. In some of the Stakes we discover that such an officer as a Priest has not been heard of; the homes of the people have never been visited by Priests, and they have never heard of a quorum of Priests in their Stake. The quorum of Teachers is almost as badly neglected in some quarters; as also is the quorum of Deacons. 

Now there is a great and a grand work for the Deacons, the Teachers and the Priests to perform, as well as for the Elders and the Seventies. If we are not faithful in the Lesser Priesthood, how can we expect to advance? If we do not fulfill the duties whereunto God has called us, how can we expect him to honor us with greater things. There is no young man in this Church who has been honored with the Priesthood of the Dea<^r> and has been faithful in discharging the duties of that calling, hut what has been honored with some higher calling and Priesthood. This is true also of the Teachers and Priests. There is always room for advancement in the Priesthood of the Son of God. Our Eternal Father will always honor those who honor Him and His authority. 

I feel that there are officers of Stakes and wards who have taken upon themselves a grave responsibility in maintaining men and women in positions in this Church who have not magnified or even appreciated the callings whereunto the Lord has called them. And I fear that in some instances whole Stakes have suffered by the example of some member of the Stake Presidency, of the High Council, or of some other organization of the Priesthood. Men have pointed to a brother who perhaps has been retained as a High Councilor or as a Stake President, who has not honored the Priesthood that has been conferred upon him, and whose example has not been a £ood one before the youth of Zion,' and they have justified themselves in evil conduct by reason of such examples. The presiding officers in Stakes and wards have been lenient in many instances. People have been tolerated who have not observed the Word of Wisdom; others have been tolerated who have not paid tithing-, and still others who have violated other laws of God; and this course has been followed in some instances because of the desire of the brethren to keep these people in the Church and save their souls. The question is, is it better to maintain officers in the Church under these conditions, for the sake of their own feeling's, than to make changes which would benefit the people in general? And is it not a fact that those who do retain officers in the Church who do not prize the Priesthood and have no interest in the work, are assuming a great responsibility? President Snow, President Cannon or President Smith cannot go into all the Stakes and wards in Zion. They therefore send the Apostles; and the Apostles never go except  are sent by the Presidency. They go into these Stakes authorized to perform certain labor, and if they, on account of leniency, retain men in office whose example they know is bad, are they not shouldering upon themselves the responsibility of the unsatisfactory conditions found in those Stakes. If this be true of the general authorities of the Church, it is also true of the Stake authorities, when they retain in office Bishops or officers in any of the different associations who are not doing- their duty? Do you believe, my brethren and sisters, that Stake Presidents will be justified in whose Stakes we have never heard tell of a Priests' quorum or a Teacher's quorum, and if we have heard tell of a Teachers' quorum, those Teachers were not doing their duty? And where Bishops allow this condition to exist, they as well as the Stake Presidents are taking upon themselves responsibilities I should not like to assume. 

Stake Presidents and Counselors, High Councilors. Bishops and Counselors ought to have the guidance and the inspiration of the Spirit of God in the selection of men to fill offices. Because a man holds a certain degree of priesthood, it does not follow that he will make a good Teacher or a good Priest, or that he will make a good man to instruct the people on the Sabbath day. Bishops and counselors and Stake officers should study this matter. They ought not to send Teachers into the homes of the people who will visit for two or three hours and never do any teaching. They ought to send men out who are filled with the Spirit of God, who will go into the homes of the Saints and pray with them, and who will make a study of the people under their watchcare. Such brethren, when they see a member of a family who is not a tithepayer, will labor with that member upon that point; and if there is a member who is not an observer of the Word of Wisdom, they will labor with that one upon that particular point, and so on. They will find all the defects and weaknesses, and in the spirit of love and kindness they will labor with those brethren and sisters who are delinquent and will try to reform them. 

We send out many Elders into the missionary field and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to carry the Gospel abroad. Is it not just as important that these quorums of the Priesthood should be active and alive to their duty, and that the members of those quorums should prize the office they hold sufficiently to keep the commandments which God has given them, in order that their example may be good before the people? We find Stake officers and ward officers who do not observe the Word of Wisdom. They have their cup of tea or their cup of coffee, or they are given to smoking, and perhaps in some instances to drinking, and yet they are tolerated. 

My brethren and sisters, in speaking this way I do so with the feeling that I would expect to be dealt with if I did not honor the Priesthood that God has conferred upon me sufficiently to let tobacco, whisky and other things that God has forbidden alone. I feel that any officer in this Church who will persist in indulging in these things and setting a bad example before the people ought to have at least sufficient interest in the work of the Lord to give up his position to some one who will prize and magnify the position that God has called him to. I do not believe that men who are living in open violation of the commandments of God prize their calling. They may think they do; they may think that they love the work of the Lord; but their very acts show that they do not. When it comes to laying aside their little cup of tea as Relief Society workers or as other workers in the Stakes of Zion, some cannot do it, not even for the sake of the example. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that this is an important matter. Every Deacon, every Teacher and every Priest ought to ask himself the question whether or not he is magnifying the Priesthood that God has honored him with. For it is an honor to be a Deacon in the Church of Christ. It is a greater honor than any that can be conferred upon men in the political world, because this work that we are engaged in is God's work, not the work of man, and God will honor those who honor the positions that are given to them in His Church. Now, where 

Teachers are not doing their duty, shall the President of the Church be held responsible? Would it be manly for the Bishop of a Ward to say that the President of the Church is responsible because his ward is not up to the mark m fulfilling the obligations that the Lord has placed upon them? It appears to me that this is not the spirit of the Gospel. The spirit of the Gospel is for every man to do his duty and not try to shift any responsibility onto somebody else. We are told that we are agents unto ourselv.es, and that we ought to be engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. When we are placed to preside over a Ward it is not necessary to go to the President of the Church to ask about every little matter, but we are entitled to the spirit of God and to the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ in our calling. If we are energetic and are working in the calling whereunto the Lord has called us, he will reveal many great and important things unto us, and he will bring to our minds many suggestions and ideas with regard to the government of our Ward. So with presidents of Stakes and High Councils and other officers of the Church. 

I am interested in the work of the Lord. I would like to see these quorums of the Lesser Priesthood in a good active condition. It is thought by some that we have concentrated our energies too much upon Sunday school work or upon Mutual Improvement work, and we have not given that attention which we ought to do to the quorums of the Priesthood. If we have erred in this direction, we ought to correct it and labor diligently to see that every quorum is in good live condition. No Stake of Zion can be up to the mark whose quorums of the Priesthood are inactive. Inactivity is death, and there are too many dead members in the Priesthood. The man who will grow in this Priesthood and come to the front is the man who labors. And as with the man, so with the quorum. The Stake President who will develop himself and his Stake is the one who is actively engaged in his calling. If he is not thus engaged, instead of growing he will wither up, and his Stake will suffer. Now it appeara to me that the progress of the work of God in the wards and in the Stakes is of greater importance than the feeling of any man or woman; and it would seem to me that Latter-day Saints who actually believe that this is the work of the Lord, when they know that changes can be made which will benefit the work of God, they will not feel hurt or that an injustice is being done by such changes. I believe that some censure has been merited by some Stake officers for not making changes that ought to have been made. I believe that if they had made these changes manfully and under the influence of the spirit of God, and explained to those affected why they were necessary, the brethren would not have felt half as bad as it has been supposed they would. 

I thank the Lord for his goodness and for the blessings which this people are enjoying at the present time. The thing for us to do is to hold on to the end; not simply to go part of the way, but to go all the way, doing the will of our Father from day to day so far as it is made clear to us. 

Our labor for salvation reminds me very much of an experience that was brought to my attention this season by a colony of our people going into Wyoming. I heard of one or two of them who became discouraged before they got to the Summit in Parley's canyon, and one or two more became discouraged when they got to some other summit; while others turned back as they' were going or after they got there. Now those people did not receive any reward. Their time was thrown away. Others, after they got there and engaged in the toil which was necessary to settle up any new country, became discouraged and they also left. And others will leave. This has been the history of the settlement of all our new countries. I am told that at least onehalf of the people that went to Cache Valley in early days returned because they did not think they could live there. In listening to Brother Judd Brother Ricks, Brother Card and other brethren who are having experience in this same line, I can sympathize with them, for our experience is similar to theirs. There are some people who turn back all along the way. So it is  on our journey and search for salva. Some are afraid of the water; they dare not go into the water to be baptized. Then there are others who after they are baptized are afraid of something else. They cannot make the sacrifice, as they consider it, of paying their tithing. They cannot keep the Word of Wisdom. They cannot be honest, or virtuous, or truthful. The result is, we find one turning off here, and another there, and leaving the ship Zion. Now, only those are benefitted who continue in their search for salvation, and in their journey toward eternal life. Only those receive a reward who pass through the hardships and* the discouraging conditions arid continue in the way of life unto the end. If we turn back any time before then, our labors have been in vain and we will not receive the reward. We are told that blessed is the man who endureth temptation, for he shall receive a crown of life which the Lord has promised. 

My brethern and sisters, whatever position we have been called to occupy in this Church, or whatever quorum of Priesthood we are members of, the only way we can receive the promised reward is to labor constantly and to keep the Spirit of God. If we will do this, we will love the work - of God more every day of our lives. I thank God that this has been my experience. I have felt better every day in the labors which the Lord has called me to perform, and my pleasure in them increases. I know this is the case with all men and women that work to bring about righteousness. Those who endure trials and temptations, those who are full of zeal and of the Spirit of God from morn until night, you will always know just where to find them. Great and glorious will be their reward. 

I thank the Lord for the testimony I have that this is his work. I receive new testimonies every day of my life. I know that God is with this people, and I know that He will bless everything that is undertaken as indicated through the Pr^>w of God. It is enough for us to know that the Lord has indicated through His mouthpiece what should be done, and it is for us to give heed unto it. May God  that we may have His Spirit in all our labors; that we may be true to the testimonies we have received; that we may love the work of the Lord, and not be jealous of any department that is thriving; but that we may desire, as Bishops and Stake Presidents, to concentrate our efforts upon the part of the work which is a little delinquent, and see to it that it is brought to the front, in order that every department of the Priesthood may be united. If it is possible for the Presidency of this Church and the Apostles to be united to a man, that the president of the quorum of the Apostles can say to the Presidency of the Church that nothing in righteousness can be required of these men that will not be done, so it is possible for this to be said of the Seventies, and of the High Priests, and of the Elders, and of every department of the Priesthood, if all men will labor to bring this result about. God grant that this may be the case; that we may be encouraged, and that the blessings of God may attend every effort which we put forth toward the upbuilding of His kingdom. I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen.

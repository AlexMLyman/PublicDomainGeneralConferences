FIRST DAY. 



The Seventy-first Semi-Annual Con- 
ference of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints opened in the Taber- 
nacle. Salt Lake City, at 10 a. m., Oct. 
5th, 1900: 

Of the general authorities present 
there were, of the First Presidency,

Joseph F. Smith; of the quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles — Brigham Young, 
Francis M. Lyman, John Henry Smith,

The conference opened by the choir 
and congregation singing the hymn 
which begins: 

Our God, we raise to Thee, 
Thanks for Thy blessings free, 
We here enjoy. 

After the opening prayer, the choir 
and congregation sang the hymn com- 
mencing: 

Redeemer of Israel our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing, we call, 
Our shadow by day and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

Glorious prospects of the faithful— Necessity for 
personal knowledge as to their source— Phil- 
osophy of trials— Care exercised in the selec- 
tion of presiding officers— Examples of Christ 
and Job. 

Brethren and Sisters, I feel to rejoice 
greatly in having this opportunity of 
meeting with you this morning and to 
deliberate upon all such things and 
talk about them, as may pertain to our 
present condition and secure our future 
prospects. When this Gospel— these 
principles which we have espoused— 
came to our ears in the different coun- 
tries and nations where they found us, 
of course they opened up to us certain 
prospects— prospects that relate to the 
present time, and to present time mat- 
ters, of the highest consequence in re- 
lation to our temporal salvation; and 
again, prospects in reference to the fu- 
ture; what should be the outcome of 
keeping the commandments of God; 
what should follow; what should be the 
results when we have accomplished 
these things that are required of us; 
what would be the results in the next 
life. 

Now, so far as regards our temporal 
advantages and our temporal prospects, 
they certainly must be far superior to 
any that were before us before this 
Gospel reached us; before the offer of 
salvation saluted our ears. In the days 
of Noah the Gospel which we have es- 
poused was proclaimed to the people of 



2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



his generation, and the same prospects 
as are presented to us were presented 
to them, temporal advantages, temporal 
salvation, and spiritual exaltation and 
glory; and the circumstances were of 
that character that every person that 
listened to the voice of Noah could re- 
ceive clear manifestations, satisfactory 
knowledge, that what he said came 
from the Almighty. Now when we re- 
ceived these principles it was clear to us, 
I presume, that we actually received 
assurances, the most perfect assur- 
ances, that what was said to us, 
was actually of the Lord, that the par- 
ties that brought us these principles 
were actually inspired from the Most 
High. The nature and character of the 
work that each one would necessarily 
have to perform, the circumstances 
that would surround us and the trials 
and temptations to which we had to 
be exposed, would require a perfect un- 
derstanding, not through the teachings 
of these individuals that proclaimed to 
us these principles, but actual mani- 
festations and assurances that should 
come from the Lord, either by extra- 
ordinary faith or by a perfect reception, 
physical and spiritual, of the Holy 
Spirit, a baptism of the Holy Ghost, as 
was promised in former days to those 
that should receive the Gospel. 

I dare say that the people that are 
before me this morning have learned 
that it was an absolute necessity to 
have a perfect understanding, and an 
understanding that could only come di- 
rectly from the Lord. It would not be 
satisfactory simply to turn over the 
leaves of the New Testament and to 
see that these principles were in ac- 
cordance with those preached by the 
Apostles of old, but to have this knowl- 
edge come directly to themselves from 
the Lord. Now, I say this in order that 
if there are any Latter-day Saints, who 
have not advanced to this knowledge 
and can not see and understand clearly 
that they have espoused the principles 
of salvation and exaltation and glory, 
and that directly from the Lord, it is 
time they were about receiving this in- 
formation. 

"We are not through with our labors 
yet, although we have got through a 
great many of them that have been 
considerable of a trial to us, and temp- 



tations, perhaps, have been to some of 
us of a nature that almost amounted 
to a disposition to turn away 
from the principles that we had re- 
ceived. The trials and temptations 
have been very great to many of our 
people, and more or less, perhaps, to all 
of us. The Lord seems to require some 
proof on our part, something to show 
that He can depend upon us when He 
wants us to accomplish certain things 
in His interest. The reason is that the 
condition in which we will be placed in 
the future, as time passes along, as 
eternity approaches, and as we move 
forward in eternity and along the line 
of our existence, we shall be placed in 
certain conditions that require very 
great sacrifice in the interests of hu- 
manity, in the interests of the Spirit 
of God, in the interest of His children 
and our own children, in generations to 
come, in eternity. Jesus Christ the Son 
of God was once placed in a condition 
that it required the highest effort in 
order to accomplish what was neces- 
sary for the salvation of millions of the 
children of God. It required the highest 
effort and determination that had to be 
exercised before the Son of God could 
pass through the ordeal, the sacrifice 
that was necessary. 

I believe that his Father had edu- 
cated him, had passed him through 
scenes that were of a very serious 
character, of great trials, and he knew 
just what he could depend upon from 
the facts that were illustrated and 
shown by his experience. We place 
men here from time to time in positions 
of presidents of Stakes, as Bishops of 
wards. We are called upon sometimes 
to take into consideration whom we will 
place in this Stake or that Stake of 
Zion to preside over us. Perhaps there 
are fourteen thousand members, Lat- 
ter-day Saints, in that Stake, or there 
may be fifteen or twenty thousand, and 
the prosperity of the people of that 
Stake, to a certain extent anyway, de- 
pends upon the qualification of 'that 
president. 

How can we determine in or- 
der to make the proper selection? 
How are we to determine so as to make 
a wise selection, in placing the respon- 
sibilities upon a man that we nronose 
to take this position? The people of 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW.

the Stake are greatly concerned; they 
want a good man; they want a wise 
man; they want a man that by night 
and by day will think how he can best 
improve them, make them happy, place 
them in circumstances that will be 
agreeable, and advance them. "We look 
around to find a man that we feel has 
a thorough interest in the people, and 
that is a wise and a good man, and it 
is well that we should. That is our 
business— to look after the interest of 
the Saints, and to place suclvmen be- 
fore them to look after their interests 
as will be faithful in their calling and 
will be unselfish, and will not spend 
their time in any other direction than 
that which pertains to the general ad- 
vancement of those they are appointed 
to look after. Is it possible that 
we sometimes make a mistake and 
get the wrong man? Well you 
perhaps should be the judges. But 
I can tell you one thing, surely, that we 
use our best efforts to find the proper 
man. How do we do it? We send 
somewhere about eighteen hundred 
missionaries to the nations of the earth. 
We keep about that number of mission- 
aries in the different nations. We ap- 
point men here at home, we place re- 
sponsibilities upon them, large respon- 
sibilities. We look over the history of 
these men. Perhaps this man was a 
Bishop. Well, how did he act and per- 
form his duties as a Bishop? Did he 
devote himself to the interest of the 
people of his ward or was he trying to 
make himself wealthy? Was his mind 
devoted to saving what he 
could for himself and in en- 
hancing his own individual in- 
terests and that* of his wife and 
children and neglecting the interest of 
the people of his ward? How is it? 
We inquire around. We get the 
history of the man, his past experiences 
He has had several calls here and there. 
Did he answer those calls? Was he 
called as a missionary to leave his wife 
and his children and go to the nations 
to be gone two years or three years or 
four years, as the case may be? And 
did he go, or did he say: "Oh, no; I 
would like to go very well, but my cir- 
cumstances are not quite so pleasing or 
advantageous as they ought to be un- 
der such circumstances in order that 



I might go; I cannot go and leave my 
family very well." 

Did he make these excuses, and how 
has he been all along the path of his 
life for the past few years or for many 
years as the case might be? We judge 
the man not always by his looks or ap- 
pearance; not always by hearing him 
preach a sermon; but we judge him by 
what he has done or failed to do in the 
past. That is just the way the Lord 
intends to do with you or me 
exactly. We will be judged according 
to what we have done or what we have 
failed to have done all along the line of 
our experiences. When Jesus was 
placed in a condition where acting in 
propriety or otherwise confronted him; 
when he saw before Him the cross and 
the immediate prospects of being placed 
upon it and of his undergoing those 
excruciating: tortures that he had seen 
others experiencing, then his nature 
failed as it were and he said: Father 
if it be possible that this experience or 
this cup pass from me, let it pass. 

That is the way he told the Lord. But 
notwithsanding, he said: If this can- 
not be done, Thy will be done, and not 
mine. So he was placed upon the cross 
and suffered that excruciating torture.. 
Supposing that he had failed, the na- 
tions of the earth and the people of the 
Lord, his sons and daughters, would 
have failed to be put into the posi- 
tion of having the opportunity that you 
and I have today. They would have 
failed for a long time, to say the least. 
Of course the provisions would have 
been made and the work of the Al- 
mighty would have been proceeded with, 
but there would have been a halt there. 
But the Lord knew just what he could 
depend upon, and therefore, he selected 
that son of His, our Savior, Jesus 
Christ, and he has wrought out that 
great work of redemption for the hu- 
man family, the living and the dead. 

Now brethren and sisters, what have 
these principles we have espoused done 
for us? Are you satisfied? I am, per- 
fectly and fully satisfied. I have gone 
through a great many things that were 
very unpleasant, far from being agree- 
able, all along the line, and I do not 
know how much further or what else 
will be required of me of this charac- 
ter; but I am satisfied with what the 



•1 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord has done for me and what I ex- 
pect He will do in regard to my tem- 
poral affairs, temporal salvation, and 
also in regard to the future. 

My hopes in reference to the future 
life are supremely grand and glor- 
ious, and I try to keep these prospects 
bright continually; and that is the 
privilege and the dut" of every Latter- 
day Saint. I suppose I am talking now 
to some Latter-day Saints that have 
been sorely tried and they have 
thought sometimes, perhaps like the 
Savior felt, that he had no friends, 
that his friends had all gone; and 
-everything was going wrong, and every- 
thing was disagreeable, and his circum- 
stances were continuing to get worse 
and worse, and those that he depended 
upon for assistance failed perhaps to 
render the assistance expected, and all 
that sort of thing. Likewise everything 
sometimes becomes dark to us and 
we almost forget the relationship 
that we stand in to the Lord and be- 
gin to feel as though it was not what 
we expected. 

I wonder if there are a few here with- 
in the sound of my voice that have 
feelings of this kind, like old Job had, 
for instance. A poor man who won- 
dered why his children were taken from 
-him; why his herds were destroyed 
and why his houses, his dwelling, went 
up in flames, and why he was left with- 
out anything. He formerly was a 
very wealthy man, then was left with- 
out anything. Well, his friends came 
about him. They were supposed to be 
friends. They were friends formerly. 
They came about him and wanted to 
show him that these evils came upon 
him because he had failed to do his duty 
in the past; because he had committed 
some sin. That was the kind of ideas 
that they communicated to him. But 
there was nothing of the kind. It was 
not so. They were vastly mistaken. The 
Lord had a certain position in which He 
sought to place Job in the future at 
some future time when years and years 
had rolled away perhaps, and he wanted 
to try him. He wanted to educate him 
so that he would not complain, no mat- 
ter how illy he thought himself treated 
~by the Lord. That was a glorious trial 
of Job's It has come down in his- 
tory; his experiences and his trials, and 



it has been a wonderful consolation to 
the people of the Lord to read the his- 
tory of his experiences and his trials 
and how well he passed through them. 

The religion that we have received, 
the principles of exaltation and glory 
that you and I have received, bring 
upon us persecution, or else they are 
not those principles which we thought 
they were. They bring upon us trou- 
ble upon the right hand and upon the 
left, but we should seek to be calm and 
cool as Job learned to be calm and cool 
under circumstances of the most 
uphappy character. We should learn 
to do this and there are things 
that are provided for us by which we 
can learn this. Think now of how 
much worse you and I might be, and 
then think of what superior blessings 
we actually possess. We know that in 
the future after we have passed 
through this life, we will then 
have our wives and our children 
with us. We will have our 
bodies glorified, made free from every 
sickness and distress, and rendered 
most beautiful. There is nothing more 
beautiful to look upon than a resur- 
rected man or woman. There is noth- 
ing grander that I can imagine 
that a man can possess than a resur- 
rected body. There is no Latter-day 
Saint within the sound of my voice but 
that certainly has this prospect of com- 
ing forth in the morning of the first 
resurrection and being glorified, exalted 
in the presence of God, having the priv- 
ilege of talking with our Father as we 
talk with our earthly father. 

What a glorious thing! You will 
know no prison walls, your friends 
turning away from you, your being dis- 
possessed of your property, being driven 
from your home, being cast into prison, 
being defamed. These things do not 
hurt you one particle. They do not de- 
stroy your prospects, which are still 
glorious before you. And then we 
should understand that the Lord has 
provided, when the days of trouble come 
upon the nations, a place for you and 
me, and we will be preserved as Noah 
was preserved, not in an ark, but we 
will be preserved by going into these 
principles of union by which we can 
accomplish the work of the Lord and 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW.

surround ourselves with those things 
that will preserve us from the difficul- 
ties that are now coming upon the 
world, the judgments of the Lord. We 
can see, as we read in the newspapers, 
that they are coming upon the nations 
of the ungodly; and they would have 
been upon us if we had stayed among 
the nations, if the Lord had not inclined 
our ears and brought salvation to us, 
we would have been as they are. 

Brethren and sisters, I feel to say 
God bless you. Here are my counselors. 
We are one. We are united. We do 
not quarrel with each other. We speak 
well of one another because we ought 
to do it, and we think we are worthy of 
being well spoken of by each other. 
And here we have twelve men sitting in 
front with us — Twelve Apostles, 
There are many of these that you know. 
You know them from hearing what they 
have accomplished. You have a per- 
sonal acquaintance with some of us. 
Now they are with us heart and soul. 
We are united together. We do not 
quarrel with each other. We do not 
slander one another, but we go where 
counsel requires and we are heart and 
soul together. What for? Not to make 
ourselves rich, not to make ourselves 
wealthy, but to see what we can ac- 
complish in the interests of the people, 
and we are laboring continually to see 
what we can do. We come together 
every week and we talk about what we 
can do for the people. What can we do 
for these forty-two or forty-three 
Stakes of Zion? Are some of the pre- 
siding Elders, some of the presidents 
of these Stakes, getting too old to ad- 
minister to the people? Are some of 
them neglecting their interests? We 
talk these things over. We study and 
consider them. We try to ascertain 
what they are doing and what their 
feelings are and how they manifest 
them in the presence of the people. Are 
they working for themselves? Are they 
trying to see how much money they can 
get into this bank or the other, or are 
they engaged heart and soul in doing 
what should be done in their respective 
responsibilities? Well, we are not idle 
in these things. 

You will have a number of speakers 
here during this conference, you 



will probably have in the neighborhood 
of Twenty speeches here. When 
the brethren arise to speak yovt. 
should ask the Lord to let them 
say something that you want to know, 
that they may suggest something ta- 
you that will be of some advantage. 
If you have any desire to know certain 
matters that you do not understand, 
pray that these brethren in their talks 
may say something that shall enlighten 
your mind in reference to that which 
troubles you, and we will have a grand 
and glorious Conference, a better one 
than we have ever had before. Strange 
as it may appear, our last Conference 
always seems the best, and may this be 
the case; and you brethren and sisters, 
let your hearts rise up to the Lord and 
exercise faith while our brethren are 
talking to you. We will not be disap- 
pointed, and you will not go home, you 
will not retire from this Conference, 
without feeling you have been greatly 
and abundantly blessed. Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT. 

Spirit of Union among the Presidency and Twelve- 
—Indebtedness is bondage — Labor should be 
created for the young— Beneficent results of 
tithe- paying— Avoid Procrastination. 

I am truly grateful to our Heavenly 
Father for this privilege of speaking 
at our Semi-annual conference to the 
Saints of the Most High, and I shall 
claim an interest in the opening prayer 
made by Brother Young, that the Spirit 
of the Lord will attend those who ad- 
dress this congregation. I shall also- 
ask you, my dear brethren and sisters, 
to give me your faith and prayers, as 
requested by the Prophet of the Lord; 
for I have had experience enough in 
speaking to the Saints to know that 
without their faith and prayers and the 
assistance of the Spirit of the Lord, I 
can say nothing that will be of interest 
to the people. I have no desire in my 
heart to say aught this morning but 
that will be for the benefit of the mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

I am of the opinion that there is not 
a soul present in this vast audience but 
can say that the Lord has truly blessed 
them in more ways than one since our 
last conference. I am thankful that 
the principles of the Church to which 
we belong are so broad that they not

only cover our spiritual welfare, but ex- 
tend farther and cover our temporal 
welfare. As President Snow referred 
this morning' to our material interests, 
I wished to myself that the people of 
this Church knew the true feelings and 
desires of the Presidency and Twelve 
Apostles of this Church with regard to 
the material interests of every mem- 
ber of the Church. I bear testimony 
to you concerning what President Snow 
said in regard to the unity that exists 
among the Presidency of this Church 
and the Twelve Apostles. Unity and 
love truly exist with them, and I would 
that the same spirit extended to every 
member of the Church. My belief is 
that if that unity and love existed 
among all the people, together with a 
determination to do only that which 
God requires, the power of the Church 
and of the members thereof would be 
so far-reaching that all hell and the 
devil himself could have no power 
over this organization. I do not believe 
that the love, union and determination 
of the Presidency and Twelve were ever 
greater since the Church was organized 
than at the present time. Our desire is 
to do nothing but that will advance the 
interests of the Church and Kingdom of 
God. We want the people to be pre- 
pared for the coming of the Son of God 
— which I say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, is nearer than many of us an- 
ticipate. 

I ask you, my brethren and sisters, 
to be prayerful and humble, and to seek 
the same spirit that the Presidency and 
the Apostles have; and I promise you 
that you shall have a testimony that 
they are working for your interest and 
for the advancement 6f the Church of 
God upon this earth. The quorum of 
the Twelve Apostles visit every Stake 
in the Church. They go into the homes 
of the people; they listen, not only to 
the complaints of the people, but also 
to the desires of the Saints, and they 
know the true feelings of their hearts, 
they know their virtues and their 
short-comings. I do not believe, there- 
fore, that there are any better capable 
of judging as to what the members of 
this Church require than the Apostles 
and the Presidency of the Church. 
Moreover, they labor to this end, to 
advance not only the spiritual wel- 



fare of the Saints, but also 
their temporal interests. There is 
scarcely a. day passes without some of 
them meeting together to consider mat- 
ters of great importance to the people, 
and among them none greater than the 
salvation of our youth. These ques- 
tions are talked over and the brethren 
become familiar with and instructed 
regarding them, and then they go forth 
to teach the people how to avoid many 
conditions and evils that are existing, 
some of which have been so trying to 
the souls of the Later-day Saints. 

I desire now to mention one thing 
that has brought sorrow to many a 
home, and that is, so many Latter-day 
Saints running in debt and not know- 
ing how to get out of it. It is my hope 
and desire that the warning which has 
been sounded among the Stakes of 
Zion for the last year or more, advising 
the Saints to keep out of debt, and 
those who are in debt to get out as soon 
as possible, will be heeded by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints; for I tell you that to an 
honest man there is no bondage con- 
trolled by human laws upon the face 
of the earth greater than the bondage 
of debt. I trust that the note of warn- 
ing which has been given by the Apos- 
tles in all the Stakes of Zion, at the 
quarterly conferences, will be heeded 
by those who are in debt and by all 
people. Ask God's blessings upon your 
efforts in this direction, and at the 
same time remember the Lord in your 
tithes and your offerings, and He- will 
bless you and so shape your circum- 
stances that relief will come unto you 
who are in debt. And when you are 
relieved, do not go in debt any more. 
The improvement made by the people 
in this regard during the past six 
months is marvelous, from all I hear, 
and I pray God that this improvement 
will continue until the time shall come 
when not only the Church will be ab- 
solutely out of debt, but when each of 
the members of the Church will be able 
to say, "I owe no man a dollar that I 
cannot pay." Then when we are in 
this position, whatever call may be 
made upon us or wherever we may be 
called to go by the servants of the Lord, 
we can say that we are ready to go and 
fulfill the call without being under ob- 
ligations to anyone; we can perform

the duty that God requires at our 
hands, because we are free. How much 
better this would be than to be in the 
position that some of the brethren are 
in at present. President Snow report- 
ed this morning that some who were 
called on missions replied that they had 
a desire to go, but their circumstances 
were such that they really could not 
leave. These "buts" are put in a great 
many times when they have no right 
to be put in by men holding the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God, who are sup- 
posed to be minute men and ready to 
go anywhere when called. 

I also desire this morning to call your 
attention to the early days of this great 
commonwealth of ours. Allow me to 
refer you to the memory of that great 
man, President Brigham Young, and to 
some of the fundamental principles per- 
taining to our temporal welfare which 
he taught so strongly. One thing that 
he advocated long and loud was that 
the people should place themselves in 
a position to create labor for their sons 
and daughters. Are we doing this? I 
am afraid that we have almost forgot- 
ten that there was such a principle ad- 
vanced. Who taught home manufac- 
ture more than President Brigham 
Young? Who preached oftener and 
stronger and put his money into those 
institutions more than did President 
Brigham Young? We are raising young 
men by the thousands in this fair State 
of ours, and do we ever stop to think 
what they are going to do for a living? 
I hope my brethren and sisters, that we 
will think of this, and that we will, so 
far as possible, establish such industries 
here as will give employment to our 
youne- men and young women. I also 
feel that the fathers and mothers of 
this Church should begin to realize the 
importance of instructing their boys to 
prepare themselves for future life by 
learning some kind of trade. Our boys, 
as a rule— and I think that the parents 
are at fault in many instances — seem to 
drift along without caring anything 
about the responsibilities of life, or 
thinking of how they are goiner to ful- 
fill the requirements that will be made 
of them as husbands and fathers. They 
do not stop to consider these things. I 
want to say that this is not an un- 
developed country now as it used to be, 
not has it unlimited homesteads for all 



new comers, and we ought to begin . 
to think what our sons and daughters, 
especially our sons, are going to do for 
a living in the future. Take almost 
every institution that is started now by 
the people here, where skilled labor is 
required, and do we find Utah boys at 
the head of the different departments? 
Take, for example, the Provo Woolen 
Mills. Can I get a Utah boy to start 
in the dye room and learn the trade, 
and stick to it until he knows every 
requirement of this department? No, 
I cannot. The result is, we are com- 
pelled to send east to get a man who 
has lived in a community where it was 
absolutely necessary for him to learn 
every detail of the business, in order 
to take charge of that department, 
and it is so with other departments. I 
hope we will begin, as fathers and 
mothers, to see our responsibility in re- 
gard to our children, and take care that 
they learn a trade. So far as I am 
personally concerned, if I were pos- 
sessed of millions of money I would de- 
sire every son of mine to have a trade 
at his fingers' ends, so that if every- 
thing were swept away from him he 
could fall back on his trade and make 
an honest living. I wish that every son 
in this fair State, and especially in this 
Church, was in this position. 

I had a young man come to me a 
short time ago and ask for an explana- 
tion of some remarks he had heard 
Brother Grant make concerning tithing. 
He said that at a meeting the other 
day he had heard Brother Grant ex- 
press the belief that a man who paid 
his tithing honestly— one-tenth of all 
God gave him— would be better pre- 
pared to meet his obligations with tjf.e 
nine-tenths and it would go further 
than the whole, and he did not believe 
it. He said he came to me as one who 
had studied financial matters, and 
would like to have me explain how 
ninety cents could go farther than one 
dollar. I thought a minute or two and 
then decided to take his own case for 
an example. I asked him if he would 
object to my taking his own case to 
prove to him the truth of what Brother 
Grant had said. Certainly not, he said. 
All right, said I, I will prove to you by 
your own acts that what Brother Grant 
said was an absolute fact, and I be- 
lieve it is so in nine hundred and ninety-

nine cases out of a thousand, if not in 
every case. I then remarked to him, 
"I was going- to a conference not long 
ago, and I saw you out driving on the 
Sabbath with a two-seated rig, at a 
time when you ought to have been at 
meeting." "Yes," he said, "I remem- 
ber." "What did you pay for that rig?" 
I asked. "It only cost me four dollars," 
he replied. "What are vou getting a 
month?" "Forty-five dollars a 
month." "Then," said I, "this would 
almost have paid your tithing 
on your wages for that month and you 
could have claimed the blessings of the 
Lord instead of breaking the law of 
God pertaining to the Sabbath." I 
want to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that the law of tithing is not a 
question of dollars and cents alone. I 
believe that the man who pays his hon- 
est tithing to God will not only be 
blessed by God himself, but that the 
nine-tenths will reach farther than 
would the ten-tenths if he did not obey 
that law; for the man who believes in 
the law of tithes and offerings, be- 
lieves also in the other requirements 
made by God of him, and he does not 
spend money in breaking the Sabbath 
day, nor in going to places where his 
very soul is in danger of partaking of 
things that are not good for a Latter- 
day Saint to receive. I testify as 
Brother Grant testified; I testified to 
that young man that I believed what 
Brother Grant had said, and he was 
compelled to say that he had never 
thought of it in that light before. 
Brethren and sisters, there are thou- 
sands of dollars spent by the people in 
breaking the Word of Wisdom more 
each year than all your cash tithing 
amounts to. This vast sum is sent out 
of this State and for what? Not for 
the necessities of life, but for articles 
the use of which cause the people to 
break a commandment that God has 
given us. Let us remind ourselves of 
the positions that we hold. Let us un- 
derstand what we are— that we are 
members of the Church of Christ, that 
we are the children of God, that we 
have a special work to do here, and 
that the Priesthood which has been 
given us has been given for a purpose. 
We should realize the importance of, 
this authority, and labor to the end 



that we will not do anything contrary 
to the spirit of God or the laws of thi9 
Church. 

There is another thing with our 
young people, as well as the people gen- 
erally, that I desire to call you atten- 
tion to and that is, procrastination — 
putting off till tomorrow what we 
ought to do today, and thinking that we 
will live our religion a little better next 
year. The old saying that to travel by 
the road of bye and bye will reach the 
home of never, is just as true today as 
it ever was. Let us live our religion 
today. Let us do the duty of today. 
Let us pay our tithes that we owe to- 
day. Let us do everything required of 
us today, and not put it off for some 
future time. 

My testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters, is that this is the Church of 
God; that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of the Living God; that his successors 
down to and including President Snow 
have been called of God, and that they 
have given the people the word of God. 
I hope and trust that this same testi- 
mony will be so strong in the hearts of 
every member of this Church, and es- 
pecially in the hearts of the young men 
and young women, that no matter what 
trial or temptation may come in our 
way, we can say, Thy will, O Father, 
be done, and not mine. If we get in 
this position this Church will grow and 
increase, and we will be blessed, not 
only spiritually, but in every way that 
God can bless a son or daughter of His. 
To this end I ask God's blessings upon 
the Church and upon the people, and 
may peace and plenty be yours forever, 
with a glorious salvation in the king- 
dom of God, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Growth of the spirit of Union— Building of Temples 
and vicarious work for the dead— Thoughts 
and desires of the Paints should be directed 
to their ancestors— Valuable suggestions up- 
on this subject. 

Brethren and sisters: I have greatly 
rejoiced in the remarks that have been 
made to us this morning, and in the 
spirit of union alluded to by President 
Snow. I can testify that, so far as I 
have been able to observe, the most 
perfect union exists among the First 
Presidency and Twelve;' and so far as 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON.

my observation has gone, I can also tes- 
tify that there is a spirit of union and 
harmony among the First Seven Presi- 
dents of Seventies, and with the Presid- 
ing Bishopric, and with the Patriarch, 
and with very many, if not all, of the 
Stake presidencies, the Bishops and 
counselors of wards, and the presi- 
dencies of quorums. And I believe that 
this spirit of oneness and union is grow- 
ing upon the Latter-day Saints. There- 
in is the strength of this Church. 

There is a subject that is very near to 
my heart, and I would like to say a few 
words upon it this morning, if the 
Spirit of the Lord shall give me freedom 
of speech; otherwise I should wish that 
it might be taken entirely from my 
mind, because I desire to speak to the 
Saints only that which the Lord desires 
I should speak, and which will be most 
suitable for the occasion. I will first 
read from an address to the Saints by 
the mighty prophet of these latter 
times, the Prophet Joseph Smith. These 
were his words: 

And again, verily thus saith the Lord, 
let the work of my Temple, and all the 
works which I have appointed unto you, 
be continued on and not cease; and let 
your diligence, and your perseverance, 
and patience, and your works be re- 
doubled, and you shall in no wise lose 
your reward, saith the Lord of hosts. 
And if they persecute you, so persecut- 
ed they the prophets and righteous men 
that were before you. For all this there 
is a reward in heaven. 

And again, I give unto you a word in 
relation to the baptism for your dead. 

Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you 
concerning your dead: When any of 
you are baptized for your dead, let there 
be a recorder, and let him be eye-wit- 
ness of your baptisms; let him hear 
with his ears, that he may testify 
of a truth, saith the Lord: 

That in all your recordings it may 
be recorded in heaven; whatsoever you 
bind on earth, may be bound in heaven; 
whatsoever you loose on earth, may be 
loosed in heaven; 

For I am about to restore many 
things to the earth, pertaining to the 
Priesthood, saith the Lord of hosts." 

In another place: 

"Now the nature of this ordinance 
consists in the power of the Priesthood, 
by the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
wherein it is granted, that whatsoever 
you bind on earth shall be bound in 
heaven, and whatsoever you loose on 
earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, 
in other words, taking a different view 



of the translation, whatsoever you re- 
cord on earth shall be recorded in 
heaven; and whatsoever you do not 
record on earth, shall not be recorded in 
heaven; for out of the books shall your 
dead be judged, according to their own 
works, whether they themselves have 
attended to the ordinances in their own 
propria persona, or by the means of 
their own agents, according to the or- 
dinance which God has prepared for 
their salvation from before the founda- 
tion of the world, according to the 
records which they have kept con- 
cerning their dead. 

It may seem to some to be a very 
bold doctrine that we talk of — a power 
which records or binds on earth, and 
binds in heaven. Nevertheless in all 
ages of the world, whenever the Lord 
has given a dispensation of the Priest- 
hood to any man by actual revelation, 
or any set of men, this power has al- 
ways been given. Hence, whatsoever 
those men did in authority, in the name 
of the Lord, and did it truly and faith- 
fully, and kept a proper and faithful 
record of the same, it became a law on 
earth, and in heaven, and could not 
be annulled according to the decree of 
the great Jehovah. This is a faithful 
saying! Who can bear it? 

And again, for the precedent, Mat- 
thew xvi, 18, 19, "And I also say unto 
thee, that thou art Peter: and upon 
this rock I will build my Church; and 
the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it; and I will give unto thee 
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and 
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth 
shall be bound in heaven; and whatso- 
ever thou shalt loose on earth shall be 
loosed in heaven." 

Are not these most glorious words, 
my brethren and sisters? Even in 
those early days of the Church the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was exercised 
very greatly concerning the temples of 
the Lord, so much so, that the word of 
the Lord came to him, and from him 
to the people, that they must not cease 
the work of His temple, and all the 
works which He had appointed. Spe- 
cial stress was laid on this subject of 
the temple. The spirit of temple-work 
has rested down upon the Latter-day 
Saints from that day until this, and I 
doubt not will rest upon them with great 

power from now until the morning of 
the resurrection, and from the morning 
of the resurrection until the thousand 
years of the Millennium have expired. 
This spirit will grow stronger and 
brighter with this people. Was it not 
upon President Young and the Pio- 
neers? Almost the first words he ut- 
tered concerning this land were made 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon this block, when, striking his cane 
upon the ground, he said, "Here we will 
build a temple of God." How glorious^ 
ly that prediction has been fulfilled! 
That Temple has been erected, though 
he did not live to see its completion— 
a monument to the faith, the determi- 
nation and the good works of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Not only is there a 
Temple on this block, but there is one 
at St. George, one at Manti, and one at 
Lo-an. And shall we cease building 
Temples? No; other Temples will be 
built. There is a reason for this. 

Strangers come into our midst, and 
they gaze upon the Temple. In many 
instances they say it is a magnificent 
building, a great accomplishment to 
have been commenced in the early days 
of the settlement of this country and 
to have been carried on at such vast ex- 
pense until finally completed. It cer- 
tainly was a great accomplishment. 
But, my brethren and sisters, the value 
of that building is not in its outward 
appearance, not in the expense that 
has been put in it, not in the beauty of 
its architecture, nor in the richness of 
its furnishings. The value of that 
Temple is in the ordinances which are 
performed therein for the living and the 
dead. 

The keys of this great power of bind- 
ing and sealing, referred to by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, are with us. 
That power breaks down the barriers 
of the grave. By it both the living and 
the dead are made to stand before the 
Lord as if there were no such thing 
as mortal time. Moreover, the dead 
are made equal with the living. 
Glorious thought! Do we not see that 
God is no respecter of persons? The 
man who lived upon earth in a time 
when the light of the Gospel had been 
extinguished, and who therefore lived in 
ignorance of the Gospel, will not be 
consigned to endless misery because 
he did not accept an opportunity that 
never came to him, but the mercy and 
justice of God will reach out to that 
man and he will have the opportunity 
in the other life. Therein is the virtue 
and force of the binding and sealing 
power. It reaches into the spirit world 
to every soul, no matter how humble or 
obscure that soul has been on earth. 
The^ light of the Gospel will break in 



upon him, and there will be a time ip. 
the other life for repentance and refor- 
mation. Then shall the people of the 
earth go forth in the temples of God 
and do a vicarious work for those be- 
hind the veil, as the Savior of the 
world has done a vicarious work for us 
all. We will taste of the fruits of His 
great work in our salvation; so will the 
dead receive the good fruits of our 
work in their behalf in the temples of 
God. 

Is it not time, brethren and sisters, 
that our minds should run back and be 
interested in the fate and condition of 
our ancestors? Shall we not be inter- 
ested in every soul that has passed 
away? Must_ not the chain be made 
complete, and the dead be connected 
with the living, and the living with the 
dead? Otherwise, we shall be rejected 
as a church; for the Apostle has told 
us that we without them cannot be 
made perfect, nor they without us. 

Some thoughts have come to my mind 
in relation to this great and glorious 
subject, and these thoughts have rela- 
tion to the missionary work of this 
Church. We are calling upon many 
able-bodied young men to go forth and 
proclaim the Gospel of salvation to the 
nations of the earth. This glorious duty 
and privilege is today resting upon the 
young men of Israel. But there 
are many who are not in a position to 
accept a call of this kind. Many are 
deeply engrossed in the affairs of life in 
a way perchance that they cannot be 
spared to take upon them this great re- 
sponsibility. Then there are those who 
are so advanced in years that it would 
not be wisdom for them to go forth and 
proclaim the Gospel. Must it be said of 
them that they shall be denied the priv- 
ilege of becoming saviors upon Mount 
Zion, because of the infirmities of age 
and the engrossing cares of life? No, it 
shall not be so said. There is a chance 
for them. If they cannot go forth into 
the world to win souls unto Christ, let 
them go forth into the temples of God 
and spend a portion of their time in 
working for the salvation of the dead. 
I believe that the soul of one who is 
dead is just as precious in the sight of 
God as the soul of one who is living. 
Need the father say to his family, 
"There-is not rmich-.ojpportunity now-for

me to do good; my days of usefulness 
are past." No; your days of usefulness 
are still with you; your opportunities 
are still present; go forth and perform 
this great labor. 

But it Will be said by many in the 
Church that their employment or their 
business connections are such that they 
cannot give any time to temple work. 
What shall be done in such cases? Men 
are spending their whole time, not alone 
in providing for themselves and their 
families the comforts of life, but to ac- 
cumulate means and build up a fortune. 
This is being done by hundreds of Lat- 
ter-day Saints; for God is blessing and 
multiplying His goodness upon the peo, 
pie, and the windows of heaven are. 
opened unto us, until many are becom- 
ing rich in this world's goods. Is it not 
so? If you do not believe it, go to some 
of the Stake conferences and see the 
expensive vehicles that are tied all 
around the meeting house. Do people 
walk to meeting any more? Not except 
they live within a half a block of it or 
so. If they live a mile or a mile and a 
half away, they never think of walking. 
And they do not need to 
walk; for God has blessed them 
with horses and carriages, 
by means of which they can ride to 
meeting in comfort. They are being 
blessed in all their affairs and multi- 
plied exceedingly, until it has come to 
that condition that some of our 
brethren in the Church hardly know 
what to do with their means. 

The question with them is. Where 
shall we invest our riches? Put money 
in the sugar factory? Yes, by all 
means, because it is a good investment; 
it pays a good dividend. It did not 
pay a good dividend when the Presi- 
dency of this Church were urging the 
people to take hold of the industry 
and contribute of their means to estab- 
lish it. They could not see it then; 
but now they can see it, and sugar 
stock can hardly be purchased at pres- 
ent, it is so desirable. However, as I 
was saying, the people hardly know 
where to put their savings. 

Now, I want to tell the men of 
means among the Latter-day Saints of 
a good investment; where they can 
place some of their means to bring 



them in a hundred per cent. Find me 
an investment in this country today 
that pays twelve per cent, or perhaps 
fifteen per cent, and I will point out 
to you a most splendid enterprise. But 
this investment that I allude to will 
pay one hundred per cent, and never 
fail. What is it? Lay up some of 
your treasures in heaven. Invest with 
the Lord. Put some of your means in- 
to His temple. 

If you are so busily employed in 
looking after your material interests, 
which are so vast and varied that it 
takes all your time, send your son to 
the temple, and support him while he 
works there for you. If you have no 
son, perhaps you have a good neighbor, 
a man of God, who has no means of his 
own and no employment; send him to 
the temple, and provide well for him 
while he is there; look after his bodily 
wants, and let him work for your dead 
and save your ancestors. 

Perhaps you will tell me that you 
have no list of your ancestors; you 
have not even a single name. 
I take it that that is no excuse. 
If you cannot do a work for 
your own dead, do a work for your 
neighbor's dead. Assist that poor man 
across the way who has perhaps hun- 
dreds and thousands of names, but has 
no means and no way of having them 
officiated for, and verily you shall in no 
wise lose your reward. When an Elder 
is sent into the world to preach the Gos- 
pel, if circumstances are favorable, he 
goes first to his relatives and acquaint- 
ances, and then he preaches the Gospel 
to the world. So we must labor at 
home. If we cannot get information 
concerning our own dead, let us expend 
a portion of our means, if we have any, 
for the salvation of the dead of others. 
In this we will manifest the spirit of 
true charity. 

As it is at present, we find that in 
some instances brethren are building up 
fortunes for their children to quarrel 
over and spend when they are gone. We 
know by experience that we cannot 
take these things with us from this 
life, and the result is. all we accumu- 
late of this world's goods is left be- 
hind, and trouble generally arises 
among children over such things. 

I am reminded of an occurrence that 



12 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



is said to have actually happened. One 
of our rich brethren died, and after a 
time his spirit returned to earth. He 
visited a friend, and this is the language 
that he used in speaking to that friend: 
"What a fool I have been. I spent days 
and weeks, months and years upon the 
earth in accumulating means, and I 
was abundantly successful. I built up 
a big fortune, and then I was called 
away. I passed into the spirit world, 
and left it all for my children to quar- 
rel over. "What a fool I have been." 

Is there not a text in his words? It 
might have occurred to that man, while 
he was talking to his friend, that he 
could have founded an institution of 
learning, or endowed a hospital, or bet- 
ter than that, he could have creat- 
ed a temple fund; that is to say, 
he could have provided amply 
for each one of his children, and 
with the remainder, or a goodly 
portion of it, could have created a 
temple fund, to be used for the salva- 
tion of the dead; and had the fund been 
sufficiently large, the interest only, and 
not the principal, might have been ex- 
pended to save his dead and the dead 
of others. Perhaps the thought occurred 
to him that if he had done this, while 
his body rested in the grave and his 
spirit dwelt in the spirit land, the 
means that God had given him on earth 
would be doing a great and glorious 
work and perpetuating his memory up- 
on earth. This is one way in which we 
can perpetuate our memories. 

It seems to me that this is a most 
glorious subject to contemplate. And 
not only shall the brethren be saviors 
upon Mount Zion, but the sisters, too, 
shall share in this glorious work; for 
they can go to the temple and assist in 
officiating for the dead. The sisters as 
well as the brethren shall have credit 
on the books for their share in this 
grand work. Brethren and sisters, here 
are the temples before us. Now let me 
ask the question, Who shall be worthy 
to go into them and to do the work 
that I have indicated? You know some- 
thing of the power and sacredness of 
the work; you know something of this 
binding and sealing power; you know 



the great responsibility of exercising 
that power. I ask you, Who shall be 
worthy to go into these temples? We 
have been told by our Prophet and 
President that the man who does not 
pay his tithing in this Church shall not 
have access to them. Not that he shall 
be coerced, not that he shall be fright- 
ened, by this saying of the President's; 
but simply because he is unworthy to 
go into the temple. If he violates this 
great commandment of God — the law of 
tithing— then he is not worthy to re- 
ceive and participate in the blessings of 
the House of the Lord. It is a simple 
proposition. The Bishop shall not rec- 
ommend him; the president of the 
Stake shall not recommend him. They 
cannot do it. It would not be pleasing 
in the sight of God. And they who vio- 
late the other commandments — and! 
there are many who disregard the au- 
thority of the Priesthood, who slight 
the counsels of the servants of God, and 
who will not give ear to their teachings 
— are not worthy to go into the house of 
the Lord and officiate for the living and 
the dead. And that shows a very close 
connection between the living and the 
dead, between this world and the other 
world; for you can scarcely mention 
the work for the dead, except you shall 
say something concerning the living; 
and you can scarcely speak of the liv- 
ing, except you shall say something 
concerning the dead. 

I believe that God speaks to us as if 
we were in eternity, and that whenever 
He gives a commandment or a law un- 
to this Church, it is done as if there 
were no such thing as death or a veil 
dividing us from His presence. His 
laws are permanent and eternal in their 
nature; they are binding upon this 
world and upon the world to come; 
they are binding upon the living and 
binding upon the dead. 

As I have said, this is a glorious 
theme for contemplation, and could not 
be exhausted in a sermon a month long. 
God bless you. Amen.

All hail the glorious day, 
By Prophets long foretold.

Individual Re=ponsibtiity of the Saints— Neglect of 
duties of the Priesthood deprecated— Baneful 
effects of bad example— Officers should be 
wisely selected— Saints . should not take 
their hands from the plow. 
My beloved brethren and sisters: I 
feel very grateful this afternoon that 
the Lord is mindful of his people. I 
thank him for the prosperity that is at- 
tending the Latter-day Saints, for the 
liberty that we enjoy, and for the mar- 
velous way in which he has operated 
upon the people in many sections of the 
earth to bring about the freedom that 
his servants enjoy today. In standing 
before you this afternoon I feel very 
humble, and I pray that the power and 
inspiration of God may rest upon me 
that I may be led to give forth the 
words that he would have me speak on 
this occasion; for he knows the hearts 
of this people and the teachings that 
will be best adapted to their needs. I 
have greatly enjoyed the instructions 
that have been given here today. I do 
not know that I ever heard President 
Snow speak when his voice sounded 
clearer or more forceful than it did this 
morning, and this reminded me of the 
change that ofttimes comes over men 
when they are called of God to certain 
positions. In many instances their 
bodies and their minds seem to be re- 
novated and renewed by the power of 
God within them. I felt in listening 
to President Snow's words to glorify 
the name of our Eternal Father for his 
goodness and for the abundant mani- 
festations of his approval of this peo- 
ple. 

There is a matter that I have thought 
of a great deal of late in connection 
with the work of our Heavenly Father, 
and that is the individual responsibility 
which the Latter-day Saints are under. 
I doubt very much if in our different 
callings we appreciate this as we ought 



to do. There is too great a tendency 
on the part of those who bear the Holy 
Priesthood to try to shift responsibility 
onto the presiding officers of the wards 
or the Stakes or the Church. Did we 
ever think of the fact that every one 
of us should be as interested in the 
work of God as our brother or our sis- 
ter? We ought not to try to shift re- 
sponsibility onto some one else; but we 
ought to secure a clear conscience be- 
fore God by faithfully discharging the 
duty whereunto we have been called, 
be that duty ever so humble. 

Every quorum of the Priesthood is 
necessary in the Church of Christ. If 
it were not, it never would have 
been given to us. I have 
been alarmed at the dis- 
regard of duty shown by many men 
who have been honored with the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God. Especially 
is this the case in the Lesser Priest- 
hood, and in many instances it is to be 
found among the Elders and Seventies. 
This ought not to be. I feel that we 
will never arrive at the condition which 
we would like to attain until there is a 
renewal of interest in all the quorums 
of the Priesthood. Our heavenly Father 
has placed each quorum in the Church 
to perform an especial labor. The duty 
of the Deacon is different from that of 
.he Teacher, the duty of the Teacher 
is different from that of the Priest, the 
duty of the Priest is different from that 
of the Elder, the duty of the Elder 
from that of the Seventy, the Seventy 
from that of the High Priest, and the 
High Priest from that of the Apostle. 
In some of the Stakes we discover that 
such an officer as a Priest has not been 
heard of; the homes of the people have 
never been visited by Priests, and they 
have never heard of a quorum of 
Priests in their Stake. The quorum of 
Teachers is almost as badly neglected 
in some quarters; as also is the quorum 
of Deacons. 

Now there is a great and a grand 
work for the Deacons, the Teachers and 
the Priests to perform, as well as for 
the Elders and the Seventies. If we are 
not faithful in the Lesser Priesthood, 
how can we expect to advance? If we 
do not fulfill the duties whereunto God 
has called us, how can we expect him 
to honor us with greater things. There 



14 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



is no young man in this Church who 
has been honored with the Priesthood 
of the Dea<^r> and has been faithful in 
discharging the duties of that calling, 
hut what has been honored with some 
higher calling and Priesthood. This is 
true also of the Teachers and Priests. 
There is always room for advancement 
in the Priesthood of the Son of God. 
Our Eternal Father will always honor 
those who honor Him and His author- 
ity. 

I feel that there are officers of Stakes 
and wards who have taken upon them- 
selves a grave responsibility in main- 
taining men and women in positions in 
this Church who have not magnified 
or even appreciated the callings where- 
unto the Lord has called them. And 
I fear that in some instances whole 
Stakes have suffered by the example 
of some member of the Stake Presiden- 
cy, of the High Council, or of some 
other organization of the Priesthood. 
Men have pointed to a brother who per- 
haps has been retained as a 
High Councilor or as a Stake 
President, who has not honored the 
Priesthood that has been conferred up- 
on him, and whose example has not 
been a £ood one before the youth of 
Zion,' and they have justified them- 
selves in evil conduct by reason of such 
examples. The presiding officers in 
Stakes and wards have been lenient in 
many instances. People have been 
tolerated who have not observed the 
Word of Wisdom; others have been tol- 
erated who have not paid tithing-, and 
still others who have violated other 
laws of God; and this course has been 
followed in some instances because of 
the desire of the brethren to keep these 
people in the Church and save their 
souls. The question is, is it better to 
maintain officers in the Church under 
these conditions, for the sake of their 
own feeling's, than to make changes 
which would benefit the people in gen- 
eral? And is it not a fact that those 
who do retain officers in the Church who 
do not prize the Priesthood and have 
no interest in the work, are assuming a 
great responsibility? President Snow, 
President Cannon or President Smith 
cannot go into all the Stakes and wards 
in Zion. They therefore send the Apos- 
tles; and the Apostles never go except 



they are sent by the Presidency. They 
go into these Stakes authorized to per- 
form certain labor, and if they, on ac- 
count of leniency, retain men in office 
whose example they know is bad, are 
they not shouldering upon themselves 
the responsibility of the unsatisfactory 
conditions found in those Stakes. If 
this be true of the general authorities 
of the Church, it is also true of the 
Stake authorities, when they retain in 
office Bishops or officers in any of the 
different associations who are not do- 
ing- their duty? Do you believe, my 
brethren and sisters, that Stake Presi- 
dents will be justified in whose Stakes 
we have never heard tell of a Priests' 
quorum or a Teacher's quorum, and if 
we have heard tell of a Teachers' 
quorum, those Teachers were not doing 
their duty? And where Bishops allow 
this condition to exist, they as well as 
the Stake Presidents are taking upon 
themselves responsibilities I should not 
like to assume. 

Stake Presidents and Counselors, 
High Councilors. Bishops and Counsel- 
ors ought to have the guidance and the 
inspiration of the Spirit of God 
in the selection of men to fill 
offices. Because a man holds 
a certain degree of priesthood, 
it does not follow that he will make a 
good Teacher or a good Priest, or that 
he will make a good man to instruct 
the people on the Sabbath day. Bishops 
and counselors and Stake officers should 
study this matter. They ought not to 
send Teachers into the homes of the 
people who will visit for two or three 
hours and never do any teaching. 
They ought to send men out who are 
filled with the Spirit of God, who will 
go into the homes of the Saints and 
pray with them, and who will make a 
study of the people under their watch- 
care. Such brethren, when they see a 
member of a family who is not a tithe- 
payer, will labor with that member up- 
on that point; and if there is a 
member who is not an observer of the 
Word of Wisdom, they will labor with 
that one upon that particular point, 
and so on. They will find all the de- 
fects and weaknesses, and in the spirit 
of love and kindness they will labor 
with those brethren and sisters who are 
delinquent and will try to reform them. 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF.

We send out many Elders into the mis- 
sionary field and spend hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to carry the Gospel 
abroad. Is it not just as important that 
these quorums of the Priesthood should 
be active and alive to their duty, and 
that the members of those quorums 
should prize the office they hold suffi- 
ciently to keep the commandments 
which God has given them, in order 
that their example may be good before 
the people? We find Stake officers and 
ward officers who do not observe the 
Word of Wisdom. They have their cup 
of tea or their cup of coffee, or they 
are given to smoking, and perhaps in 
some instances to drinking, and yet 
they are tolerated. 

My brethren and sisters, in speaking 
this way I do so with the feeling that I 
would expect to be dealt with if I did 
not honor the Priesthood that God has 
conferred upon me sufficiently to let to- 
bacco, whisky and other things that 
God has forbidden alone. I feel that 
any officer in this Church who will per- 
sist in indulging in these things and 
setting a bad example before the peo- 
ple ought to have at least sufficient in- 
terest in the work of the Lord to give 
up his position to some one who will 
prize and magnify the position that God 
has called him to. I do not believe that 
men who are living in open violation of 
the commandments of God prize their 
calling. They may think they do; they 
may think that they love the work of 
the Lord; but their very acts show that 
they do not. When it comes to laying 
aside their little cup of tea as Relief 
Society workers or as other workers in 
the Stakes of Zion, some cannot do it, 
not even for the sake of the example. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that 
this is an important matter. Every 
Deacon, every Teacher and every Priest 
ought to ask himself the question 
whether or not he is magnifying the 
Priesthood that God has honored him 
with. For it is an honor to be a Dea- 
con in the Church of Christ. It is a 
greater honor than any that can be 
conferred upon men in the political 
world, because this work that we are 
engaged in is God's work, not the work 
of man, and God will honor those who 
honor the positions that are given to 
them in His Church. Now, where 



Teachers are not doing their duty, shall 
the President of the Church be held re- 
sponsible? Would it be manly for the 
Bishop of a Ward to say that the Pres- 
ident of the Church is responsible be- 
cause his ward is not up to the mark 
m fulfilling the obligations that the 
Lord has placed upon them? It appears 
to me that this is not the spirit of the 
Gospel. The spirit of the Gospel is for ev- 
ery man to do his duty and not try to 
shift any responsibility onto somebody 
else. We are told that we are agents 
unto ourselv.es, and that we ought to 
be engaged in bringing to pass much 
righteousness. When we are placed to 
preside over a Ward it is not necessary 
to go to the President of the Church to 
ask about every little matter, but we 
are entitled to the spirit of God and 
to the revelations of the Lord Jesus 
Christ in our calling. If we are ener- 
getic and are working in the calling 
whereunto the Lord has called us, he 
will reveal many great and important 
things unto us, and he will bring to our 
minds many suggestions and ideas with 
regard to the government of our Ward. 
So with presidents of Stakes and High 
Councils and other officers of the 
Church. 

I am interested in the work of the 
Lord. I would like to see these quorums 
of the Lesser Priesthood in a good ac- 
tive condition. It is thought by some 
that we have concentrated our energies 
too much upon Sunday school work or 
upon Mutual Improvement work, and 
we have not given that attention which 
we ought to do to the quorums of the 
Priesthood. If we have erred in this 
direction, we ought to correct it and la- 
bor diligently to see that every quorum 
is in good live condition. No 
Stake of Zion can be up to 
the mark whose quorums of the 
Priesthood are inactive. Inactivity is 
death, and there are too many dead 
members in the Priesthood. The man 
who will grow in this Priesthood and 
come to the front is the man who labors. 
And as with the man, so with the 
quorum. The Stake President who will 
develop himself and his Stake is the 
one who is actively engaged in his 
calling. If he is not thus engaged, in- 
stead of growing he will wither up, and 
his Stake will suffer. Now it appeara 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to me that the progress of the work 
of God in the wards and in the Stakes 
is of greater importance than the feel- 
ing of any man or woman; and it would 
seem to me that Latter-day Saints who 
actually believe that this is the work 
of the Lord, when they know that 
changes can be made which will bene- 
fit the work of God, they will not feel 
hurt or that an injustice is being done 
by such changes. I believe that some 
censure has been merited by some Stake 
officers for not making changes that 
•ought to have been made. I believe 
that if they had made these changes 
manfully and under the influence of the 
spirit of God, and explained to those 
affected why they were necessary, the 
brethren would not have felt half as 
bad as it has been supposed they would. 

I thank the Lord for his goodness 
and for the blessings which this people 
are enjoying at the present time. The 
thing for us to do is to hold on to the 
end; not simply to go part of the way, 
but to go all the way, doing the will of 
our Father from day to day so far as 
it is made clear to us. 

Our labor for salvation reminds me 
very much of an experience that was 
brought to my attention this season by 
a colony of our people going into Wyo- 
ming. I heard of one or two of them 
who became discouraged before they 
got to the Summit in Parley's canyon, 
and one or two more became discour- 
aged when they got to some other sum- 
mit; while others turned back as they' 
were going or after they got there. 
Now those people did not receive any 
reward. Their time was thrown away. 
Others, after they got there and en- 
gaged in the toil which was necessary 
to settle up any new country, became 
discouraged and they also left. And 
others will leave. This has been the 
history of the settlement of all our new 
countries. I am told that at least one- 
half of the people that went to Cache 
Valley in early days returned because 
they did not think they could live 
there. In listening to Brother Judd 
Brother Ricks, Brother Card and other 
brethren who are having experience in 
this same line, I can sympathize with 
them, for our experience is similar to 
theirs. There are some people who 
turn back all along the way. So it is 
• on our journey and search for salva- 



tion. Some are afraid of the water; 
they dare not go into the water to be 
baptized. Then there are others who 
after they are baptized are afraid of 
something else. They cannot make 
the sacrifice, as they consider it, of 
paying their tithing. They cannot keep 
the Word of Wisdom. They cannot 
be honest, or virtuous, or truthful. 
The result is, we find one turning off 
here, and another there, and leaving 
the ship Zion. Now, only those are 
benefitted who continue in their search 
for salvation, and in their journey to- 
ward eternal life. Only those receive 
a reward who pass through the hard- 
ships and* the discouraging conditions 
arid continue in the way of life unto the 
end. If we turn back any time before 
then, our labors have been in vain and 
we will not receive the reward. We 
are told that blessed is the man who 
endureth temptation, for he shall re- 
ceive a crown of life which the Lord 
has promised. 

My brethern and sisters, whatever 
position we have been called to occupy 
in this Church, or whatever quorum 
of Priesthood we are members of, the 
only way we can receive the promised 
reward is to labor constantly and to 
keep the Spirit of God. If we will do 
this, we will love the work - of God 
more every day of our lives. I thank 
God that this has been my experience. 
I have felt better every day in the 
labors which the Lord has called me 
to perform, and my pleasure in them 
increases. I know this is the case with 
all men and women that work to bring 
about righteousness. Those who en- 
dure trials and temptations, those who 
are full of zeal and of the Spirit of 
God from morn until night, you will al- 
ways know just where to find them. 
Great and glorious will be their re- 
ward. 

I thank the Lord for the testimony I 
have that this is his work. I re- 
ceive new testimonies every day of my 
life. I know that God is with this peo- 
ple, and I know that He will bless 
everything that is undertaken as indi- 
cated through the Pr^>w of God. It 
is enough for us to know that the 
Lord has indicated through His mouth- 
piece what should be done, and it is for 
us to give heed unto it. May God 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

grant that we may have His Spirit in 
all our labors; that we may be true to 
the testimonies we have received; that 
we may love the work of the Lord, and 
not be jealous of any department that 
is thriving; but that we may desire, as 
Bishops and Stake Presidents, to con- 
centrate our efforts upon the part of 
the work which is a little delinquent, 
and see to it that it is brought to the 
front, in order that every department 
of the Priesthood may be united. If 
it is possible for the Presidency of this 
Church and the Apostles to be united 
to a man, that the president of the 
quorum of the Apostles can 
say to the Presidency of the 
Church that nothing in righteousness 
can be required of these men that will 
not be done, so it is possible for this 
to be said of the Seventies, and of the 
High Priests, and of the Elders, and 
of every department of the Priesthood, 
if all men will labor to bring this re- 
sult about. God grant that this may 
be the case; that we may be encour- 
aged, and that the blessings of God 
may attend every effort which we put 
forth toward the upbuilding of His 
kingdom. I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

My brethren and sisters, I feel grate- 
ful for another conference, and for the 
opportunity of being associated with 
you. It is our duty to obtain the word 
of the Lord, and it does not depend 
solely upon the authority of the Church. 
There is a responsibility, as stated by 
Elder Woodruff, resting upon every 
member. It is not confined to those who 
bear the respective offices in the Priest- 
hood, but it extends to all Saints, male 
and female. As I view it, there ought 
to be some advancement on the part 
of the Latter-day Saints as a whole, and 
on the part of the Priesthood, during 
the time that intervenes between our 
general conferences. I always feel im- 
pressed when listening to my brethren, 



no matter what the subject may be 
which suggests itself to their mieds. 
The one thing that is always obligatory 
upon every Saint is to do the duty that 
devolves upon him at the moment. We 
have heard Brother Ensign sing about 
Jerusalem, the beautiful city. We some- 
times read in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, 84th section, a beautiful 
song which the Lord said should be 
sung in the last days. He says: 

"For I, the Almighty, have laid my 
hands upon the nations, to scourge 
them for their wickedness: 

"And plagues shall go forth, and they 
shall not be taken from the earth until 
I have completed my work which shall 
be cut short in righteousness, 

"Until all shall know me, who remain, 
even from the least unto the greatest, 
and shall be filled with the knowledge 
of the Lord, and shall see eye to eye." 

President Snow, Elder Smoot and Elder 
Clawson testified this morning that the 
Presidency of the Church and the 
Twelve Apostles are united and see 
"eye to eye." I wish to say that this 
ought to be the status of the Presiding 
Council of Seventies, and I presume it 
is. It ought to be the condition of ev- 
ery council of Seventies throughout the 
Church. It ought to be the condition of 
the Presiding Bishopric of this Church, 
and I suppose it is. It ought to be the 
condition of the presiding authorities of 
every quorum in the Holy Priesthood 
down to the presidency of the last quor- 
um of Deacons, which has been estab- 
lished in the Church. It ought to be 
the condition of every Stake presidency, 
of every High Council, of every Bishop- 
ric, of the presiding authority of every 
branch, of every Elder, of the presi- 
dency of every mission, of every con- 
ference president and of every Elder in 
every mission on the face of the earth. 
There should be an absolute unity 
throughout the Church. And this unity 
can only be brought about by a com- 
mon enjoyment of the Holy Ghost. It is 
tho only thine: on this earth or in the 
heavons that will brinir people to a 
unity of the faith. It was this spirit 
which led us in the first place to em- 
brace the Gospel, and when we were 
baptiz ed w e received a title to the cora- 
pambnship" or tne jnoly GftostT, and we 
were promised that he should guide us 
into all truth. 



IS 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



I would like to impress upon the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that we ought to be 
guided by the Spirit of the Lord in ev- 
everything that affects the welfare of 
this people. No Latter-day Saint bear- 
ing the Holy Priesthood ought to go 
to any place without the companionship 
of the Holy Ghost. I do not care 
whether it is a dance, to enjoy a little 
innocent recreation, or whether it is a 
political meeting, to consider the great 
questions ot the day, he ought to take 
the Priesthood of God with him and en- 
joy the inspiration of the Holy Spirit 
in what he says and does. By that I 
do not mean that we ought to use our 
Priesthood in any manner that is not 
justifiable, but I do mean to say that 
we ought always to remember that we 
are Latter-day Saints, and that there is 
no consideration affecting the welfare 
of this people in which we are justified 
in separating ourselves from the 
thought that we are Latter-day Saints, 
and that the highest responsibility that 
rests upon this people is to establish the 
Church and Kingdom of God upon the 
earth. I feel that we have broken away 
to a great extent from the old fashioned 
spirit of the Gospel, if you will allow 
me to use that expression. I think 
^sometimes that we have not so much 
faith in God as had the patriots who 
founded this country. When they pre- 
pared the Declaration of Independence 
they invoked the inspiration of the su- 
preme God to guide them in the fram- 
ing of that document. And they se- 
cured that inspiration. It was guided 
by the Spirit of the Lord, and the Lord 
had a hand in it. You remember, per- 
haps, reading what purports to be a 
speech delivered by Patrick Henry in 
the Congress at Philadelphia, at a time 
when men were afraid to stand up for 
what they considered to be the rights 
of the colonists of this country and to 
establish upon this land a government 
that should be free from allegiance to 
every other government. In that 
memorable address he made this state- 
ment: 

"It is not given to our poor human 
intellect to climb the skies, to pierce 
the councils of the Almighty One. But 
methinks I stand among the awful 
clouds which veil the brightness of Je- 
hovah's throne. Methinks I see the 



Recording Angel— pale as angel is pale, 
weeping as an angel can weep— come 
trembling up to the throne, and speak- 
ing his dread message: 

" 'Father! The Old World is baptized 
in blood. Father! It is drenched with 
the blood of millions, butchered in war 
in persecution, in slow and grinding 
oppression. Father, look! With one 
glance of Thine eternal eye, look over 
Europe, Asia, Africa, and behold every- 
where a terrible sight— men trodden 
down beneath the oppressor's feet, na- 
tions lost in blood, murder and su- 
perstition walking hand in hand over 
the graves of their victims, and not a 
single voice to whisper hope to man.' 

"He stands there (the angel), his 
hand trembling with the black record 
of human guilt. But hark! The voice 
of Jehovah speaks out from the awful 
cloud: Let there be light again. Let 
there be a New World. Tell my peo- 
ple the poor, downtrodden millions, to 
go out from the Old World. Tell them 
to go out from wrong, oppression and 
blood. Tell them to go out from the 
Old World, to build my altar in the 
New." 

In the closing words of the speech, 
he made this significant remark: 

"As God lives, my friends, I believe 
that to be His voice. Yes, were my 
soul trembling on the wing of eternity, 
were this hand freezing in death, were 
my voice choking with the last strug- 
gle, I would still, with the last gasp of 
that voice, implore you to remember 
the truth God has given America to be 
free." 

This was the spirit of Nephi. Nephi 
declared in the name of the Lord that 
God had decreed that this land should 
be a land of liberty, and that there 
should not occupy it any people that 
would hold in servitude any other class 
of people. So that when in ^he his- 
tory of this great country the question 
arose regarding the slavery of the black 
race, it was a foregone conclusion that 
that section of the nation which es- 
poused their freedom, would gain the 
victory over those who sought to main- 
tain slavery, because God had decreed 
that the people of this land should be 
free. 

What I desire to call your attention 
to is the fact that the hand of Al- 
mighty God is in all these things, and 
when I see Latter-day Saints breaking 
away and feeling that they ought to be 
free from any considerations that 
would benefit the work, I feel that they 
are not true to the history of the coun- 
try in which we dwell and to that pa- 



* 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

triotism which God decreed the Latter- 
-day Saints should exhibit. For I say 
that in this land there are no people 
that have so great a respect for the 
Constitution of the United States as 
have the Latter-day Saints. There are 
no people that can have the respect 
for it that they can. I do not wish 
to impeach the respect of other people 
for that glorious instrument, but the 
depth of the respect that is entertained 
by the Latter-day Saints is based upon 
their knowledge of the purposes of 
God concerning this land and the in- 
stitutions which God inspired the people 
to found. The Roman empire prior to 
the coming of the Savior tol- 
erated all classes of religions, no 
matter what dogmas they 

taught, and this policy was main- 
tained until the Son of God came and 
established His Church. His Church, 
however, came in contact with the in- 
stitutions of men, but it did not seek 
to injure any of these men. It was 
established for the salvation of the 
human. family, to lift them upon a high- 
er plane, and to point them the way to 
eternal life. It was the only plan of 
salvation, devised in the heavens above. 
Because of the freedom granted to all 
religions by the Roman empire, Jesus 
was enabled to establish His Church 
upon the earth. So in these last days 
God inspired the founders of this coun- 
try for the same purpose. They sought 
the inspiration of the Almighty when 
they framed the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence and the Constitution of the 
United States. We read in the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants that God raised 
up men and inspired them to frame the 
constitution of this land, and many of 
these men laid down their lives in de- 
fense of human liberty and to lay the 
foundation of a government upon this 
land which should be a palladium of 
human rights, unequalled by any other 
civil government upon the face of the 
earth! ~~ God says He inspired the Con- 
stitution; and every law made in pur- 
suance thereto He declares to be a righ- 
teous law, and every law not in pur- 
suance thereto an unrighteous law: 
'And whatsoever is more or less than 
these cometh of evil." He further states 
that the Saints of God are justified in 
upholding the institutions of this coun- 



try ;^and_in thos e days when the Con- 
stitution had not been infringed and 
trampled upon by ungodly men, he said 
that no man had occasion to break the 
laws of the land in keeping the laws 
of God. He also said that righteous- 
men should be selected to administer 
the affairs of government, men who • 
would uphold the Constitution of the 
country and who would maintain the-' 
rights of the people in every State. 

I want to tell you, Latter-day Saints, 
that we have not got out of the woods: 
yet. No circumstances will arise in this 
country that will affect the welfare of' 
this people, either from a religious, a' 
political, a financial, a social, business,, 
scientific, or any other standpoint, butt 
what Almighty God is bound to have 
something to say in regard to them. 
He may not come out and say it 
through the voice of the Prophet of.. 
God; but it is expected that every Lat- - 
ter-day Saint is a prophet of God, and 
that he will get the will of the Lord to • 
Guide him in all these matters. What- 
did Moses say to those who sought his^ 
rebuke of some persons that tea* 
prophesied in Israel? Why, said he, "E 
would to God that all the Lord's people 
were prophets." We ought to be proph- 
ets, and we ought to seek the mind 
and will of the Lord on every subject 
that arises. If we will do this, we shall 
know for ourselves. Unless we feel this 
way I believe I am justified in saying: 
that it will be a long time before we 
shall be able to sing this song con- 
tained in the 84th section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. In all affairs, in 
whatever arises, we ought to seek the 
mind and will of God thereon, and try 
to understand what will be for the best, 
interests of the Latter-day Saints. We 
are justified in so doing. There is not: 
one principle of the Gospel that will\ 
lead me to entrench upon the right of a: 
Methodist, a Baptist, a Catholic, an in- 
fidel or any other man, no matter what 
his religion or his politics may be. There- 
is not one covenant of the Holy Priest- 
hood that will lead me to do this. I; 
have read the secret oaths and cove- 
nants of some of the combinations that 
exist in this land, and I want to raise 
my voice against the Latter-day Saints 
identifying themselves with these 
"tares," which are being bound in bun-

diet prepared for the burning. Their 
covenants are the cords that bind them. 
I say that every Latter-day Saint who 
J keeps his covenants made in the waters 
of baptism or elsewhere will be a good 
citizen and will never infringe upon the 
rights of any people; but he will take a 
course that will exalt the people and 
that will tend to the maintenance of 
fret-dom ux>on this land. We are in- 
terested in this country. This is the 
land of Zion. This is the land where 
Adam dwelt. This is the land where 
he built his altar and offered sacrifice 
to God. This is the land where the Gos- 
pel was first revealed to the children of 
men. This is the land where the ordi- 
nance of baptism was first performed 
upon this earth. This is the land where 
the Holy Ghost was first given to man. 
This is the land that God has always 
led people to when He wanted to secure 
unto them the best of freedom. He led 
people from Jerusalem at different 
times, and he established them upon 
this land. He gave them Prophets 
and Apostles and inspired men, and He 
bes^owea upon them the inspiration of 
the Almighty to guide them in all walks 
Of life. 

I feel impressed upon this subject. It 
seems to me that the Latter-day Saints 
are not controlled as they ought to be 
. by the Spirit of the Gospel in some 
of the walks of life. It is the risrht of 
everv man and woman in this Church 
to have a testimony of the Holy Spirit 
as to how to act in all these matters. 
I have sought the Lord in regard to 
these things long ago and this is how I 
feel. Let me remind you that the devil 
is not dead. The adversary of righte- 
ousness is working his leaven among 
the Latter-day Saints. He is trying to 
destroy the youth of this people by se- 
ducing them from the paths of chastity 
and virtue; by filling their minds with 
skepticism, and by establishing in their 
hearts the idea that there are some 
things connected with the people of 
God concerning which the servants of 
God ousht to keep their mouths shut. 
Now, I know the men that founded this 
commonwealth and the enterprises of 
this land. They came here when it was 
a howling wilderness and laid the foun- 
dations of material prosperity in these 
mountain valleys. They established 



the institutions of learning. They 
have built the Temples of God from 
Cache Valley on the north to St. George 
on the south. And I know that they 
have been men of God, every one of 
them, from the Prophet Joseph Smith 
down to President Lorenzo Snow. I 
know that the servants of God 
have His mind and will; and the 
Latter-day Saints can have it too. I 
want to tell you how you can get it. 
As I started out to say, it is by the 
daily performance of every duty that 
devolves upon us. You show me a 
man who is constantly engaged in 
prayer and supplication, and I will point 
to you a man that does not have to be 
preached to in regard to the subject 
of tithing; he does not have to be urged 
to send his children to Sunday school, 
and to get his boys into the quorums of 
the Lesser Priesthood. He is so full of 
the Spirit of the living God that he 
wants them there all the time. The 
man who attends to his family prayers 
and to his secret prayers, the man who 
pays his tithes and offerings, the man 
who shows his willingness, when called 
upon, to carry the Gospel to the nations 
of the earth or to act in the capacity 
of a Deacon at home, that is the man 
who will obtain the mind and the will 
of the Lord. I have seen not only the 
hand of the Lord, but the hand of the 
adversary working its way among the 
Latter-day Saints. Satan is seeking to 
divide them and to poison their minds 
in regard to the authorities of the 
Church and the leaders in the various 
Stakes of Zion. Men have said that 
they must not seek for counsel, and at 
the same time they have sought coun- 
sel from men who possess the spirit of 
apostasy. They have sought counsel 
from men who to my personal knowl- 
edge have secured their livelihood from 
the Latter-day Saints and have spent 
their nights playing cards and talking 
against the Authorities of this Church. 
You can seek counsel from that class of 
men, but if you seek counsel from 
President Snow or from Apostle Mer- 
rill, who presides over the Cache Val- 
ley Stake, or from some of the brethren 
who preside over the Stakes in Idaho— 
I say if you seek counsel .from these 
men as to what would be for the best 
interests of the people in this inter-

mountain region, oh, you are going to 
the wrong kind of men! Now, I want to 
say that I am going to these men for 
my counsel. I propose, God being my 
helper, (I do not say this boastingly, 
for I feel that I am the weakest among 
my brethren) to know the mind and 
will of the Lord on all subjects; 
and whether in casting a political vote 
or in lifting my hand to support the 
Prophet of God, I propose that the chief 
consideration in my heart shall be, what 
is the will of the Lord? I want to know 
His will. Are we the people of God, or 
are we not? Has God changed? No. 
Has the everlasting Gospel changed? 
No, and it never will. It is the same 
yesterday, today and forever. 

There are a certain class of pious 
men among us that I call hypocrites. 
They are "too good" to do anything 
that is not considered just right by the 
world, whether it is right in the sight 
of God or not. They are after the or- 
der of the men who, in the days of 
Jesus, sought to bring Him into disre- 
pute, and even impeached the honor of 
His birth, because they did not un- 
derstand it. They are the kind of men 
that condemned Rahab, the harlot, be- 
cause she hid the spies. Why did she 
hide the spies? Was it to infringe upon 
the rights of the people of Jericho that 
she hid them and preserved them from 
those miserable minions of the law? No, 
she did it for righteousness sake, to 
protect innocent men in their liberties. 
What does the Apostle Paul say about 
that woman? He said it should be ac- 
counted unto her for righteousness. 
God commanded Abraham to offer up 
his son Isaac, and yet it had been writ- 
ten. Thou shalt not kill. Abraham 
withheld not his son. He took him to 
the altar. He prepared the kindling 
wood, and proposed to sacrifice his son 
upon the altar, in obedience to the com- 
mand of God. He did not know that 
God would provide a ram in the thicket, 
or that he would send an angel to 
say. "Lay not thine hand upon the 
lad, neither do thou anything 
unto him for now I know that thou 
fearest God. seeing- that thou hast 
not withheld thy son, thine only son, 
from me." 

Brethren and sisters, we do not want 
to be hypocrites., and we do not want 
to be so cowardly that we are afraid 



to ask God for His Holy Spirit and for 
that inspiration which has been sought 
for by men of this country from the 
days of George Washington down to 
the present. There are no people in 
these United States who have been 
more patriotic to the institutions of our 
country than the Latter-day Saints^ 
Have they ever lifted their hands 
against the Stars and Stripes? No. 
Have they ever lifted their voice 
against the institutions of this country?' 
No. And I wish we had no men that 
would raise their voice against the ad- 
ministration of our country, but would 
uphold and sustain it, no matter what 
might be the politics thereof, and treat 
the men who are elected to office in our 
country with that respect which is due 
to them by virtue of their high position 
and the trust committed to them by the 
franchise of the American people. But 
the Latter-day Saints have been true 
to their country. They have furnished 
soldiers to fight its battles, some of 
whom have laid down their lives in 
defense of the Stars and Stripes on the 
soil of Cuba and in the Philippine Isl- 
ands. Whenever this people have taken 
issue with any enactment, it has been 
in a lawful manner. They have tested 
the constitutionality of laws passed by 
the Congress of the United States di- 
rected against them. When there has 
been a ruling in the courts of our Terri- 
tory that has been esteemed unconsti- 
tutional, it has been appealed to the 
highest court in the Territory. When 
that body has sustained the lower court 
they have appealed it to the Supreme 
Court of the United States, but they 
have never lifted the hand of violence; 
thev have never resorted to mobocracy 
cr to anything of that kind. When the 
Sunreme Court has given its decision 
the Saints of God have rendered obedi- 
ence to that decision. I say that we 
have made more sacrifices in the inter- 
est of respect to our country than any 
other class of people in it. My advice 
is to sustain those men who will sus- 
tain the enterprises which have been 
established by sacrifice among the peo- 
ple of God. I want to see men sustained 
in this coui.try to administer the affairs 
of the government who will not turn 
aside the citizens of any State when 
they are oppressed by mobocracy by

saying "Your cause is just, but we can 
■do nothing for you." I want to see men 
sustained in this land who will uphold 
the Constitution of our country, and 
who will dare defend its citizens in 
e\ery State and every Territory. 

I want to encourage you, brethren 
-and sisters, to do your duty, to pay your 
tithing, and to say your prayers, and 
to sustain the quorums of the Priest- 
.hood. I wish that our Lesser Priest- 
hood quorums would take up such a 
program as we have in the Mutual Im- 
provement Associations. I wish that 
all the members of the Priesthood 
would exalt their quorum and make it 
the chief consideration in the Church, 
"because God has founded it. He found- 
ed the Deacon's quorum, the Teacher's 
quorum and the Priest's quorum. All 
these other associations outside of the 
•quorums of the Holy Priesthood are 
3ielps in government, and good ones 
■too, and ought to be sustained in their 
place. If we will seek the mind and 
will of the Lord on all subjects the Lord 
will bless us; He will advance us; and 
the words of the Prophet Lorenzo 
Snow will be fulfilled in the not far dis- 
tant future by steps being taken look- 
ing to the redemption of Zion and 
planting the feet of the people of God 
on that land. Why were they driven 
from this land? Well, I believe that 
they were driven from the land of their 
inheritance because they became like 
the world. They would not accept the 
XJnited Order; they would not listen to 
the counsels of the Prophet of God 
upon all subjects, which they could 
liave done without interfering with the 
welfare or interests of any people upon 
the face of this land. Let us not for- 
get that we are Latter-day Saints. We 
■are not narrow-minded, either. Do not 
we send the Gosnel to the nations of 
the earth and ask the Elders to preach 
it without money and without price? 
Are we not willing to make any sacri- 
fice for their salvation? When they 
Slave smitten us on the one cheek, have 
we ever knocked them down? When 
they have mobbed our Elders and slain 
them, have we ever returned the com- 
pliment in the same way? No, our 
•course has been one constant chain of 
•devotion to principle and to human lib- 
erty upon this land. 



Let us do our duty, and then some 
day we will sing this song that I am 
about to read; and there will be more 
in it than there is in a great many 
songs we sing. Some of the 
songs we sing do not amount to much, 
because we do not exemplify them in 
our lives. I have helped to sing 'We 
thank the, O God, for a Prophet," when 
I knew we hardly meant it, especially 
if anything outside of religious matters 
came from the Prophet of God. Lots of 
times we sing "The Spirit of God like 
a fire is burning." But after a 
while we will sing this song which 
eame to my mind when I first arose. 

"And plagues shall go forth." 

That reminds me of Brother W. T. 
Jack and myself in Galveston last 
spring. I shall always remember it, for 
as we entered that city I said to Bro- 
ther Jack, "I would like to lift up my 
voice in this city and say that the judg- 
ments of God are coming upon the peo- 
ple." But we only had a few hours 
there and not much money to hire a 
hall, so we let it go, and we left upon 
the train for Houston. I had a feeling 
of sadness in my heart that I had not 
lifted my voice in that city and warned 
the people of the judgments that were 
coming upon the earth. Brother Jack 
will remember our conversation. There 
was an editor there, Mr. Clarence Ous- 
ley, who entertained us kindly, and who 
wrote a column and a half regarding 
the Latter-day Saints and what he had 
seen in Salt Lake City. He came here 
and looked around the city, and though 
he came with prejudice, he left with a 
feeling that these were a good people, 
and he wrote a column and a half in 
our favor. What occurred to him dur- 
ing the flood at Galveston? He gathered 
the neighbors into his house, and he 
and his family and every soul in the 
house were saved. The judgments of 
God went all around them, but they 
were spared. Now we want to warn the 
nations. I was down in Chicago a year 
ago with President Kelsch. I had been 
down in the Southern States and in the 
Southwestern States also. I am glad 
that in Chicago and in other cities in 
our land the Elders are not afraid to 
stand up and defend every principle of 
the Gospel. We are living in a land

of liberty. It is a land upon whic 
God has decreed to establish and main- 
tain His government forever. I am 
glad therefore. that these El- 
ders dare to defend the truth, 
no matter what it is. God bless 
them. The more the truth is assailed 
the more of the Holy Ghost they enjoy 
in defending it. After a while God wijl 
rule upon this land. He said that Jesus 
Christ should be the king of this land 
and no human king should reign here. 
It was a foregone conclusion that Max- 
imilian could not remain Emperor of 
Mexico, for this is a land of freedom. 
God laid the foundations of it that He 
might bring forth His Church and es- 
tablish His Priesthood upon this land. 
Therefore, I say do not forget that you 
are Latter-dav Saints. At the same 
time we can remember the injunction 
of Jesus. He said: "Make to your- 
selves friends of the mammon of un- 
righteousness." If you will follow His 
counsel you won't forget that, and you 
can make to yourselves friends of the 
mammon of unrighteousness without 
being unrighteous yourself. 

I am going to read to you this beauti- 
ful song and then sit down. If I have 
said anything wrong, I am willing to be 
corrected by President Snow or any of 
the brethren. I want to learn the 
truth. I want to be controlled by the 
truth. I want my heart to be in the 
work of God. I do not want to have 



tiany political or financial interests which 
would make the work of God secondary. 

'And they shall lift up their voice, 
and with the voice together sing this 
new song, saying: 

"The Lord hath brought again Zion. 
The Lord hath redeemed His people, 
Israel, 

According to the election of grace, 
Which was brought to pass by the faith 
And covenant of their fathers. 
The Lord hath redeemed His people, 
And Satan is bound and time is no 
longer; 

The Lord hath gathered all things in 
one; 

The Lord hath brought down Zion from 
above. 

The Lord hath brought up Zion from 
beneath. 

"The earth hath travailed and brought 

forth her strength; 
And truth is established in her bowels; 
And the heavens have smiled upon her; 
And she is clothed with the glory of her 

God; 

For He stands in the midst of His 
oeople. 

"Glory, and honor and power and might, 
Be ascribed to our God; for He is full 

of mercy, 
Justice, grace and truth and Deace, 
For ever and ever, amen." 

Brethren and sisters, respect the 
Prophet of God, listen to his counsel 
and do not seek to give him counsel. 
God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Let the 
Mountains Shout for Joy." 



SECOND DAY. 



Oct. 6, 10 a. m. — The choir and congre- 
gation sang the hymn which begins: 
Come, let us anew our journey pursue. 

Prayer by Elder George Reynolds. 

Singing by the choir: 

Softly beams the sacred dawning 
Of the great millennial morn. 

PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

I want to say just a few words. What 
I say may not be necessary to a large 
portion of this audience, but I want 
the Latter-day Saints to understand 
and think of the object of their coming 
together. It is only once in six 
months that we have such an oppor~ 



tunity as we have today, and I wish 
to remind the Latter-day Saints that 
the advantages we receive today or to- 
morrow, while gathered here, will be 
according to the spirit that we exer- 
cise individually. The Elders may ad- 
dress you here, and yet no particular 
advantage is secured unless you have 
the spirit and exercise the faith that 
it is our privilege to exercise, that we 
may be blessed to understand such 
things as may be spoken. We had a 
beautiful meeting yesterday, and the 
Spirit of the Lord was poured out 
greatly upon the Elders who spoke. We 
wish the same today, and we would

like the Latter-day Saints to forget 
everything outside of the meeting, and 
try to exercise faith that the speakers 
may advance such principles as will be 
most to our service. 

ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 
Temple T work — Baptism for the dead — To be born 
of water and of the Spirit — Be diligent in the 
Search for Genealogies — Work of thellGenea- 
lcgical Society — Missionaries should keep 
records — Religion classes. " 

Our meetings were enjoyed very much 
yesterday, and to me they were spiritual 
feasts. I hope that our meetings today 
and tomorrow may be like them, that 
we may enjoy a rich portion of the 
Holy Spirit. 

I was much impressed yesterday with 
Brother Clawson's remarks concerning 
temple work. I thought to myself, 
What a glorious principle this is! How 
thankful we are that the Lord brought 
this forth through His servant Joseph. 
It was in the latter years of his life 
that he was more deeply impressed to 
lay this matter of salvation for the 
dead before the Saints; but it was not a 
new principle. Though he preached and 
wrote upon this subject a year or two 
only before his death, still we find this 
principle referred to in the revelations 
given to him in the early years of the 
Church. In that glorious vision given 
to the Prophet Joseph and Sidney Rig- 
don concerning the different glories, we 
are told about a certain class that had 
not received the Gospel while alive, but 
had received it in prison after death. 
This shows that the Lord gave His 
Saints to understand at that early day 
that there is an opportunity for salva- 
tion after death. It manifests the great 
mercy of God, and places salvation be- 
yond the narrow bounds within which 
it is placed by other denominations. 
The Prophet Joseph could not have re- 
ceived this from man, because man did 
not teach this doctrine. It was re- 
vealed to him, and he gave it unto the 
people. In looking upon and examin- 
ing this principle, we cannot help but 
be. struck with the wisdom and mercy 
of God in providing salvation for the 
many, many millions that have died 
without a knowledge of the truth. Even 
before this allusion to the principle of 
salvation for the dead was made, it was 
given unto the Prophet Joseph. That 
first night when he received a visit 
from the Angel Moroni, the angel ex- 



plained to him several principles that 
were not known to the world, and he 
also explained several chapters of the 
prophets. Among others, he alluded to 
the prophecy in Malachi, to the effect 
that Elijah should be sent to turn the 
hearts of the children to the fathers and 
the hearts of the fathers to the children. 
"Who had understood the deep meaning 
in these words? When the Lord re- 
vealed more to Joseph we began to un- 
derstand it, and now we know that that 
prophecy pertains to salvation for the 
dead. I suppose that the boy Joseph 
did not understand the import of the 
prophecy at the time, but the Lord 
wanted these things brought forth. 
They were not evolved as the Church 
grew, but they were principles given 
before the world was. Hence in these 
first revelations to the Prophet they 
are pointed at and indicated, and grad- 
ually, as the people were ready for 
them, they were explained. 

These principles are not new. They 
were understood by the prophets of 
old and by the writers of the New 
Testament. Paul alludes to the or- 
dinance of baptism for the dead. I have 
attended several funerals in England, 
and I have been surprised to hear them 
repeat the 29th verse of the 15th chap- 
ter of I Corinthians: 

"Else what shall they do which are 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise 
not at all? Why are they then bap- 
tized for the dead?" 

How few understood the meaning of 
the words in this verse! Paul under- 
stood them, and I believe the first-day 
Saints understood this principle clearly, 
for Paul uses this as an argument in 
favor of the resurrection. What would 
be the use of being baptized for the 
dead if the dead rose not? That was 
his argument. The Saints no doubt 
practiced the principle in those days, 
because we find in the Church after- 
wards that decrees were made against 
the custom of being baptized for the 
dead. Some ten hundred years after, up 
in Russia, when some of their princes 
were converted to Christianity, they 
felt impressed to ask for that ordinance 
to be performed for their forefathers. 
Whether they had any knowledge from 
the history of the first-day Saints, or 
not, I do not know; but such an or- 



ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 



25 



dinance was actually performed in Rus- 
sia. The Apostle Peter undertood the 
principle of salvation for the dead, and 
our Savior understood it, and, I believe, 
laid it before the congregation in Naz- 
areth. After he had been out teaching 
and returned to his home at Nazareth, 
he was called upon to read from the 
roll, as was the custom in their syna- 
gogues, and when it was handed to 
him he read from the 61st chapter of 
Isaiah. When I was in Nazareth I 
visited that synagogue (at least, they 
tell us its is the same), and when I 
stood inside that old building, I won- 
dered where He had stood when He 
spoke on that occasion, and I thought 
of the glorious doctrine that He alluded 
to — salvation for the dead. I wish to 
read a few verses from this chapter: 

"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon 
me; because the Lord has anointed 
me to preach good tidings unto the 
meek; he hath sent me to bind up the 
broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to 
the captives, and the opening of the 
prison to them that are bound; 

I 

"To proclaim the acceptable year of 
the Lord, and the day of vengeance of 
our God; to comfort all that mourn." 

He read these verses, which describe 
His own mission. Among other things, 
His mission, He tells us, was to liberate 
the captives and to open their prison 
doors. This part of His mission He did 
not f Jifill while living in the flesh, so 
far as we have any account, but we 
have an account that He fulfilled it 
afterwards. Peter tells us that He 
preached to the spirits in prison— those 
that Job speaks of when he says that 
they should be brought forth out of the 
pit and out of their prison. Jesus went 
and opened their prison doors; He led 
captivity captive; He brought joy to 
the many millions that were waiting in 
prison, for His coming, who were there 
because at one time they had rejected 
the Gospel. They belonged to the ante- 
diluvians, and when Noah preached the 
Gospel to them they rejected him; 
hence they had a long time to wait, but 
finally the joyful tidings came to their 
prison house. Jesus went and preached 
the Gospel to them, and salvation was 
offered to them once more. They had 
learned by sad experience what it 
meant to reject the Gospel. 



This doctrine of salvation for the 
dead docs not have the effect, as some 
f=ay, to make men neglect the present 
opportunity, thinking that there will al- 
ways be a chance for them. For there 
is punishment meted out to those who 
reject the Gospel. It was a long time 
for the antediluvians to wait before 
the door of grace was opened unto 
them. We endeavor to impress upon the 
hearts of men the necessity of repenting 
and of living according to the com- 
mandments of God in this life. We 
want all men to understand that there 
is a law which must be obeyed by every 
one who shall enter the kingdom of 
God. Jesus laid it down to Nicodemus 
when he said that no man can enter 
the kingdom of heaven, except he is 
born of the water and of the 
spirit. The many millions that have 
passed away without having obeyed 
this ordinance, if they shall enter 
the kingdom of heaven, must be born 
of water and of the spirit, and as this 
cannot be done in the spirit world, God 
has provided that that ordinance may 
be performed for them here upon the 
earth. We cannot avoid obedience to 
this law and still be permitted to enter 
the kingdom of God. Here is the 
mercy and grace of God manifested un- 
to His children, in that He has devised 
means whereby they can receive the 
blessings even after they have departed 
from this life. You who have entered 
the Temples of God and performed or- 
dinances for your dead, know what a 
glorious work it is. Tou have unself- 
ishly labored for your relatives, and 
you have been blessed in doing so, for 
your testimonies have been strength- 
ened, and you have felt that you were 
in the presence of departed beings, and 
that you were bringing blessings unto 
them. 

The reason why I dwell on this sub- 
ject this morning is because many of 
the Saints who are imbued with a love 
for their relatives, and who would like 
to enter the Temples and do work for 
them, cannot do so because they have 
not their genealogy. Now, my breth- 
ren and sisters, we want you to be dili- 
gent in your search for genealogies. 
For this is a day in which the hearts of 
the children are turned unto the 
fathers. As soon as the Prophet Jo- 



26 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



seph brought this doctrine before the 
world and the necessity arose of 
searching for the fathers, the hearts of 
the people were turned that way. The 
Lord worked on the hearts of men, gen- 
ealogical societies sprang up every- 
where; men began to search for the 
the names of their forefathers, and 
many works have been published on 
this subject. Those who put forth these 
efforts had no idea of salvation for the 
dead, but the work of these devoted 
men has come to the Saints as a very 
great blessing. We want to gather up 
all we can in this regard. Many of the 
Saints are not acquainted, perhaps, with 
the fact that we have a genealogical 
society in our midst. We have some 
four hundred volumes on genealogies, 
and we want to get more. We would 
like to get all that is published, both 
in England and in this country, that 
can be of any aid to the Saints; and 
as the same spirit works upon the 
hearts of men in Germany, Denmark 
and other countries, we want to 
gather the information collected 
there. They are working now in those 
countries in this direction. 
In Denmark, Sweden and Norway it 
will be a difficult task to gather genealo- 
gies, on account of the change that for- 
merly took place in names, the children 
being called after the first name of the 
father. This changes the surname from 
one generation to another, like it was 
in olden times. In the Bible we read 
of Simon Bar-jona. "Bar" means 
son — Simon Jonason. Hence it is hard 
to trace the names of families in those 
countries. Yet there are several ar- 
chives in Denmark where we can obtain 
genealogy, and as the opportunity opens' 
in Sweden and Norway we want to 
have brethren there to work in this line. 
We have agents in Germany and Swit- 
zerland, so that our German and Swiss 
brethren can be helped in getting names 
of their relatives. The same may be said 
concerning New England. The society 
is trying to open communication with 
all the countries from where the Saints 
have come. Now it costs a little to get 
work of this kind done, and we would 
like our brethren who are interested in 
obtaining genealogy to become mem- 
bers of the society. It requires only a 
small entrance fee, and you will get 



that back in paying less for your names 
and in having the chance to visit the 
library and search the books that are 
already on hand. All that is paid in will 
go toward increasing our library of gen- 
ealogical works. I hope that this mat- 
ter will be remembered by the Saints. 
If you write to the Genealogical Soci- 
ety at the Historian's office, you can 
obtain all the information we can give 
you and we will help you to get more. 

I want to say a few words in regard 
to records. We advise our missionaries 
to keep diaries on their missions and to 
jot down the events of their lives. These 
by and by will be very precious. Many 
of our brethren from the early decades 
of the Church have kept records. We 
would like to get hold of these day- 
books at the Historian's office, sq that 
if there is any new matter or anything 
that might give a sidelight upon events 
already known, we may obtain the in- 
formation. We have men at the office, 
such as Andrew Jenson and others, who 
are well .acquainted with the events of 
our Church history, and who can soon 
gather out of such day-books things 
that are not known and that will be a 
help to us. We would not 
ask children who have possession 
of their father's records to give 
them to the office; but if they would 
lend them to us, we would gather from 
them what would be of use in our 
Church history. There may be some 
who would like to have them deposited 
in the Historian's office, and we would 
be glad to take them, mark them, and 
keep them safely. We are a people that 
make history every day; but we want 
this history written by ourselves. When 
you read history you find many a char- 
acter that is described to you far dif- 
ferent from the reality, because 
his history has been written by 
an enemy. Many of the sects that have 
sprung up since the days of the Apos- 
tles have been represented to us in a 
very unfavorable light, because their 
histories were written by their enemies. 
We do not want coming generations to 
read our history in a different light 
from the real truth. 

Before I sit down there is another 
matter that I would like to lay before 
our brethren. It is now time for school. 
During the summer months our religion 



ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 



classes have not been maintained, ex- 
cept in a few places. Now that the 
school year has commenced we hope 
that the superintendents and teachers 
of religion classes will see to it that the 
classes are again started and that re- 
newed interest is taken in this good 
work. We have just issued a new edi- 
tion of outlines, explaining the religion 
class movement and the procedure, and 
any of our superintendents or teachers 
can obtain this by writing to Superin- 
tendent Maeser. "We hope that this 
work will not lag, but that we will all 
see the necessity of giving our children 
that kind of education that they can- 
not obtain in our district schools, and 
that we cannot give at home because 
we have not the time. This religion 
class movement has been established in 
order that our children may be trained 
religiously as well as mentally and 
physically, and I trust that we will not 
neglect it. May God bless you, breth- 
ren and sisters; may our conference be 
a feast indeed unto all present, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

Proper care of Ohildrer — The duties of Teachers — 
Consequences of neglecting the people — The 
duty of paying tithing — Promise of a man like 
utto Moses. 

I have heard it remarked that it paid 
a good many people to come to confer- 
ence to hear the singing alone. But a 
great many things are treated upon in 
the general conference which supply 
many wants and answer many inquiries 
among the Saints. We are here for 
mutual improvement and for instruc- 
tions which will apply to us when we 
get home. There is no doubt in my 
mind that if the Latter-day Saints 
throughout the Church were fully up 
to their duties we would have condi- 
tions superior to what they are now. 
There is a laxity on the part of many 
of the Latter-day Saints. I believe, 
however, the Saints are improving. Still 
there is room for more improvement in 
the affairs of our lives. We have an 
organization in this Church which the 
Lord has given us. It was not insti- 
tuted by man, but by the inspiration of 
the Holy Ghost. This organization has 



been multiplied somewhat in the last 
few years, and no doubt will be multi- 
plied more in the future as we advance 
and become better acquainted with the 
Gospel. There are a great many of 
our young people born and reared in 
these mountains who need our care and 
attention as well as that of their par- 
ents. 

I have thouerht sometimes that many 
fathers and mothers do not give that 
attention to their children which they 
ought to have. They turn them over 
to the organizations of the Church; in 
the first place, to the Primary, and then 
to other associations as they grow old- 
er; and they neglect them at home. I 
have heard young men say that their 
fathers never asked them to pray in the 
family, and I have heard girls say the 
same. This shows a lack of attention 
on the part of parents. I am quite con- 
fident that many of the organizations in 
the Church are neglected. Take for in- 
stance, the Teacher's quorum. Every 
ward in the Church is supposed to have 
efficient men to labor as Teachers 
among the people. I believe that this 
important organization in the ward is 
in many instances, materially neglected. 
If the duties of Teachers were carried 
out as the Lord designed they should 
be, we would see a marked improve- 
ment in the midst of the peonle. These 
Teachers are not confined to spiritual 
things. They can talk and advise about 
temporal things also. In many in- 
stances, however, Teachers' visits are 
hurried over while in others they are put 
off. If the Teacher is expected to visit 
once a month, he puts it off till the last 
day before the Bishop requires him to 
report, and then he hurries around and 
does not take the time that ought to be 
taken. I know whereof I speak in re- 
gard to this matter, because in the 
early days I was trained under Brother 
Jedediah M. Grant. When the Teachers 
in the district where he labored all did 
their duty, it was called a reformation. 
We had quite a reformation in all the 
Church at that time. I remember 
very distinctly in the ward where I 
lived, Brother Grant on one occasion 
called all the Teachers to the stand. We 
met in the bowery, and had a board 
about sixteen feet long, put on some 
posts for the stand. There were twelve 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of us in the ward, and we had to stand 
up there in a row. He wanted us all 
to pray, each one in his turn, com- 
mencing on the right and going to the 
left. Someone asked Brother Grant 
afterward why he did that, and 
he replied that he wanted to 
see whether those young men 
had the spirit of prayer, so that he 
could judge if they prayed in the house- 
holds of the Saints. I was quite a boy 
at the time, and when it came to my 
turn I hesitated a moment or so. 
Brother Grant happened to be kneel- 
ing right behind me, and he turned 
around, grabbed me by the leg with his 
hand and said, "Now, you pray." Well, 
it nearly scared all the pray out of 
me. But it was an object lesson and one 
that was very profitable to me. How 
many of the Teachers who go into your 
homes, gather the family together and 
pray with the family or ask some of the 
family to pray? I question whether 
this is very strictly attended to. Now, 
it is the Teacher's duty to talk about 
all matters of interest to the Saints, 
connected with the kingdom of God. It 
, is their business to inquire of the fam- 
ily if they pay their tithes and offerings, 
that the poor may be sustained and the 
hands of the Bishop upheld. In going 
into the congregations of the Saints it is 
very seldom that I hear an Elder pray 
for the Bishop, or for his counselors, 
or for the Teachers. Teachers need not 
discuss the condition of the weather, for 
this is not part of their duty. They 
should go into the houses of the Saints 
enjoying the Spirit of the Lord, that 
they may have a refreshing from the 
Lord with that family. They go there 
to bless the family and to do them good, 
and in order to do this successfully 
they must concentrate their minds on 
the object of their labor in the midst of 
the people. By these means the Saints 
are instructed in their homes. When 
we find invalids in the households of 
the Saints who are unable to attend the 
gatherings of the people we can com- 
fort and bless them. If this were car- 
ried out as the Lord has designed it, 
the people would become more and 
more united, and they would be deter- 
mined to do their duty in paying their 
tithes and offerings and in attending 
their meetings. If the tea'chers did 



their duty in every ward, people would 
feel that they ought to go to meeting. 
I have heard people say, "We have not 
seen a Teacher in our house for a year,' r 
or for six months, as the case may be. 
This is not as the Lord designed it and 
there is some responsibility resting up- 
on the presidents of Stakes and their 
counselors in regard to this matter. 
The Lord gave a revelation to President 
Taylor in his time on this subject. It 
does not matter how isolated the Saints 
may live, they are in somebody's ward, 
and they should be sought after if it 
takes two or three days to find them. 
I can remember when Brother Preston 
was president of the Cache Stake and 
I was one of his counselors, it took us 
just one month to get around the Stake 
and visit the Saints, and then we could 
not get to all the wards. The Stake at 
that time ran from Logan to the Mon- 
tana line. Stakes now are smaller, and 
they are within the reach of every 
President. The wards are within the 
reach of every Bishop, and the teachers 
can find the people, if they are so in- 
clined. Bishops and Presidents of Stakes 
should be aroused to the importance 
of this matter, because when the people 
are neglected, the Church is neglected, 
the poor are neglected, the tithes and 
offerings are neglected. Hence we can- 
not afford, as officers in the Church, to 
neglect our duty. If we do the Lord will 
hold us to account for it. 

I believe that a president of a Stake 
should have a meeting with his coun- 
selors at least every week. They should 
sit down together, sing and pray to- 
gether, and see what the Lord will 
suggest to be done in that Stake of 
Zion. I think Apostle Lyman has ad- 
vocated this idea. I do not know how 
far it is attended to, but I say to you, 
my brethren, it ought to be attended to 
in every Stake of Zion. Then, follow- 
ing in the same line, every Bish- 
op in the Church should meet 
with his counselors and talk over mat- 
ters pertaining to the ward. Just as 
sure as you do this, you will always 
find something to talk about that will 
be of interest and benefit to the ward. 
If we do not come' up to the expecta- 
tions of the Presidency of the Church, 
it is because we fail to some extent. 
We may not fail as individuals, but we

29 



fail collectively. If we all did our duty 
the Church would be improved and the 
tithes and offerings would be increased. 
I understand they have increased; but 
they have not increased enough yet, be- 
cause the Saints throughout the Church 
do not all pay their tithing. We call 
upon all, whether in the Church or not, 
to pay their tithing. Some who are 
not in the Church will do it if you call 
upon them and ask them. Represent to 
them that they are living upon the land 
of Zion and that this is the principle 
upon which the land is to be sanctified 
and to bring forth of its strength, and 
you would find that peopje who are not 
in the Church would pay their tithing 
and it would be the means of bringing 
them into the Church, because the 
Spirit of the Lord would work upon 
them and He would manifest Himself 
to them by dream and by vision, until 
they would see the propriety of joining 
the Church. 

These are questions that have my at- 
tention from time to time, and I think 
they are of importance to the Church. 
You will read it in the Doctrine and 
Covenants that the Lord at some time 
•or other wa s going to raise up a man 
like unto Moses, to lead the people out 
of bondage. Well, that man may be 
President Snow, for aught I know. The 
Lord seems to be working upon his 
mind to try and lead His people out of 
bondage. President Snow is working 
at it all the time. He wants to get 
the Church and the people out of bond- 
age. Therefore, I say, the man like 
unto Moses may be President Snow, for 
aught I know. I do not know who it 
is. If it is not President Snow, it will 
be some man a great deal like him, 
whom the Lord will raise up in a 
natural way. 

I was much delighted with the re- 
marks of Brother Clawson and Brother 
Lund in regard to Temple work. I can 
bear testimony that they are true. The 
Lord manifsts Himself unto His Saints 
in the Temples. These manifestations 
are private. They are not talked 
abroad, but many of the Latter-day 
Saints who have entered into these 
sacred places have had manifestations 
:from God in approval of the work they 
were doing for their kindred dead. Let 

us not neglect this important thing, in 



connection with the other duties that 
pertain to our calling. 

I pray that the Lord may bless the 
Saints and fill all our hearts with love 
toward one another; that we may put 
away our bickerings and our fault- 
finding, and turn unto the Lord with 
full purpose of heart, that He may en- 
dow us richly with His Spirit; that our 
mission on the earth may be filled up 
in usefulness, so that when we get 
through it may be said of us, Well done 
good and faithful servant, enter thou 
into the joy of thy Lord. God bless 
you. Amen.

Blnd h I oo g d 8e pitrf :l r n H, ble ^ Sing p0wer of th ° Meat- 

My dear brethren and sisters: I hum 
bly pray that our Father who is in 
Heaven will bless me with a portion of 
His Holy Spirit this afternoon, that 
what I shall say may be in accordance 
with His mind and will. I feel to bear 
testimony to the truth of all that I 
have heard during this conference. I 
have felt so much like we always feel, 
I suppose, at our conferences— that this, 
is one of the best conferences that I 
have ever attended. 

There is a question that I would like 
to speak to you upon a little. It 
seems to be very much in line with the 
remarks of several of the previous 
speakers. To commence with, I desire 
to make a quotation that was made by 
Elder Clawson yesterday. It is the 
words of our Lord and Savior to Peter 
(Matt. 16, 13-19.) the presiding Apostle! 
after Peter had received the revelation 
from God that Jesus was the Christ 
Jesus said: 

"Whom do men say that I, the Son 
of Man, am? 

''And they said, some say that thou 
art John the Baptist; some Elias; and 
others, Jeremiah, or one of the pro- 
phets. 

"He saith unto them, but whom sav 
ye that I am? * 

"And Simon Peter answered and said 
thou art the Christ, the Son of the 
Living God. 

"And Jesus answered and said unto 
him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona- 
for flesh and blood hath not revealed 
it unto thee, but my Father which is in 
heaven. 



30 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



"And I say also unto thee, that thou 
art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church; and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it. 

"And I will give unto thee the keys 
of the kingdom of heaven; and whatso- 
ever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be 
bound in heaven; and whatsover thou 
shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in 
heaven." 

It is the latter remark I wish to re- 
fer to more particularly. Peter at that 
time held the same position that Presi- 
dent Lorenzo Snow holds today, and 
this was a very great endowment that 
he received from the Lord Jesus Christ, 
to bind on earth and it should be bound 
in heaven, or to loose on earth, and it 
should be loosed in heaven. This same 
power has been bestowed in these days. 
It is our custom when we 
marry a wife to go to the 
man who holds this great power 
and by His authority we are sealed to- 
gether in the holy bonds of matrimony 
for time and for all eternity, according 
to the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and we will be husband and wife in 
eternity. There are many other eter- 
nal blessings that have been given un- 
to the children of men. I wish to re- 
fer to a great promise that the Lord 
made unto Abraham, our forefather. 
The Lord was very much pleased with 
Abraham and his course in life. But 
Abraham would be a very unpopular 
man today. Out of all the millions of 
people that dwelt upon the earth then, 
the Lord saw fit on one occasion to 
visit His servant Abraham, and while 
He was there He gave him command- 
ments. He said unto Abraham: 

"Get thee out of thy country, and 
from thy kindred, and from thy father's 
house, unto a land that I will shew 
thee; 

"And I will make of thee a great na- 
tion, and I will bless thee, and make 
thy name great; and thou shalt be a 
blessing; 

"And I will bless them that bless 
thee, and curse them that curseth thee; 
and in thee shall all families of the 
earth be blessed." 

Here is another instance of a 
man whom the Lord visited and 
conferred divine authority upon, 
to bless the children of men, 
and they should be blessed, or to 
curse them and they should be cursed, 
in accordance with the authority, Abra- 



ham blessed his son Isaac; Isaac 
blessed his son Jacob; Jacob blessed his 
twelve sons from his four wives, and 
they became the founders of the house 
of Israel. In this Jacob officiated as 
a Patriarch, and he not only blessed 
his sons, but he prophesied what should 
befall them, even unto the latest day. 

I refer to these instances that we may 
have before our minds the fact that it 
has been the custom in various ages 
of the world to exercise this divine au- 
thority for the benefit of the children 
of men. Enoch, the Prophet of God, 
also officiated in this Patriarchial or- 
der, and Enoch was a friend of God. 
The Lord our God talked unto him as 
one man talks to another, and Enoch 
became so familiar with the mind and 
will of the Father that he not only led 
his people out of bondage, but he 
brought them to see eye to eye. They 
became of one heart and of one mind, 
and the Lord was so pleased with them 
that He took Enoch and his city unto 
Himself. 

I wish to draw your attention es- 
pecially to the Patriarchial order 
that has been revealed in these last 
days for the benefit of the Church and 
kingdom of God. We have a man who 
stands at the head of the patriarchal 
order in our Church. That man is 
Brother John Smith. He always sits 
here with the First Presidency of the 
Church. Why is it that he occupies 
this exalted position when sitting be- 
fore the people in their general confer- 
ences? It is because the Lord acknowl- 
edges a Patriarch as a man who is en- 
dowed with a very high office in 
the Church and kingdom of God, and 
who has a special endowment given un- 
to him for a special purpose. If there 
is any man in this Church who has a 
special calling for life it is a Patriarch. 
I have sometimes thought, however, 
from remarks which I have heard from 
men bearing the holy Priesthood, that 
the ignorance regarding the Patriarch- 
al order is extremely dense among the 
Latter-day Saints. 

In order that you may better under- 
stand my remarks, I wish to refer to a 
conversation that I had the other day 
with a gentleman in one of the Stakes 
of Zion. One of the Twelve Apostles 
had been around in that locality, mak- 



ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR.

ing some changes in the ward. What 
is the duty of the Apostles? We are 
informed by the Apostle Paul that they 
are placed in the Church for the work 
of the ministry, for the edifying of the 
body of Christ, and to bring the people 
to a unity of the faith. All these men 
on my right and on my left are engaged 
in this kind of a calling from one year's 
end to another. As I was saying, one 
of the Twelve had been around and he 
found a certain Bishop presiding over a 
ward. He felt impressed that it would 
be well to make a change in that ward. 
The Bishop was quite aged, but he had 
been a faithful man all his days; so 
faithful indeed that this Apostle felt 
impressed that if he could get the con- 
sent of the First Presidency this man 
should be ordained a Patriarch. The 
change was accordingly made. What 
was the result? This Bishop began to 
complain immediately that he had been 
laid upon the shelf, and that he had 
been dropped from his calling as a 
Bishop without receiving any special 
notice that this change was going to 
take place in his ward. 

Before proceeding any further, let me 
explain a moment. As I understand the 
order of this Church, a man who is 
called to be a Bishop is called to that 
office for the especial purpose of looking 
after the business affairs of 
that ward, and when through 
old age, sickness or incapacity 
he becomes disqualified to perform the 
duties of that office, or when through 
his faithfulness he is called to a greater 
ordination in the Church, it is right 
and pleasing in the sight of God that 
this change should take place. When 
the First Presidency of this Church 
informs a Bishop that he is released 
from presiding over a certain ward, 
there is just as much propriety about it 
as there would be if that man were pre- 
siding over a mission and he were re- 
leased from that mission by the Presi- 
dency of the Church. I am now called 
to preside over the Colorado mission. I 
do not expect that I shall stay there 
all the balance of my life, and if I re- 
ceive a release from the First Presi- 
dency of this Church at any time in the 
future, I assure you I shall never enter 
any complaint against them, or any- 
body else, rc>r being released. I want 



to say to the Bishops of wards, you are 
not called there for life; but when you 
are released from your Bishopric your 
Priesthood is never taken away from 
you, except through transgression. 

Now to return to this Bishop of whom 
I was speaking. The Apostle had felt 
inspired of God to recommend to the 
First Presidency of this Church that 
said Bishop be ordained a Patriarch. 
Did that man appreciate that patri- 
archal order which was bestowed upon 
him? No, he did not. Now, let me 
make a auotation to those who are 
laboring in this calling: 

"The rights of the Priesthood are in- 
separably connected with the powers of 
heaven, and the powers of heaven can- 
rot be controlled nor handled only 
upon the principles of righteousness." 

This man, I understand, said that he 
had never received the spirit of the 
patriarchal order. I want to tell you 
that there never was a man in the 
Church of God that received the spirit 
of any calling whereunto he was called 
until he started to administer in that 
calling. If I am called on a foreign 
mission and expect to get the spirit of 
that mission, I must go to work and 
prepare myself and begin to seek after 
the Lord. It is the same with a Patri- 
arch or any other officer in the Church 
of God. Now regarding this change 
being made without any notice to the 
Bishop, which seemed to give him so 
much offense. There is no man under 
the sound of my voice that can cite me 
to an instance where the Lord has ever 
said, "I will come and tell you when 
1 will need you for some other kind of 
a work." I have heard this kind of 
talk until I am tired of it. To me 
its always an indication of men's ignor- 
ance concerning the glorious promises 
connected with the Holy Priesthood. I 
have heard of an instance where a man 
said that he had been laid upon the 
shelf. I have heard of others who have 
actually been offered the privilege of be- 
ing ordained a Patriarch and have re- 
fused it, because they felt like they 
were being degraded rather than ex- 
alted in the Priesthood. I say again 
that the Lord never informs people 
when he is going to make a change. In 
his own time he comes and makes the 
change. Let us see what one of the 
greatest men that e'»r lived, m my 



32 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE 



opinion, said when a change of this 
kind was made with him. He was a 
man whose character I have always ad- 
mired. I have loved his memory, and 
I love his descendants today. As I re- 
member, he was occupying the position 
next to the Prophet, Seer and Revelator 
to this Church — exactly the same high 
and exalted position that President 
George Q. Cannon occupies in the 
Church today. I refer to Hyrum Smith. 
The mind and will of the Lord came 
unto him without any notice whatever, 
and he did not complain about it, he did 
not feel like he had been laid on the 
shelf. The word of the Lord is as fol- 
lows: 

"And again, verily I say unto you, let 
my servant William be appointed, or- 
dained, and anointed, as a counselor 
unto my servant Joseph, in the room of 
my servant Hyrum, that my servant 
Hyrum may take the office of Priest- 
hood and Patriarch, which was ap- 
pointed unto him by his father, by 
blessing and also by right. 

"That from henceforth he shall hold 
the keys of the patriarchal blessings 
upon the heads of all my people, 
, "That whoever he blesses shall be 
blessed, and whoever he curses shall be 
cursed: and whatsoever he shall bind 
on earth shall be bound in heaven; and 
whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall 
be loosed in heaven; 

"And from this time forth I appoint 
unto him that he may be a Prophet, and 
a Seer, and a Revelator unto my 
Church, as well as my servant Joseph." 

The last paragraph contains a special 
appointment unto Hyrum Smith and 
does not refer to Patriarchs in general, 
without they receive a similar commis- 
sion from the Lord. But the power to 
seal on earth and it shall be sealed in 
heaven belongs to every Patriarch 
in the Church of Christ. 

Did Hyrum Smith stand up and tell his 
brother Joseph that he was occupying 
the position of one of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church and stood as the 
second man in the kingdom, and he did 
not wish to be released from that posi- 
tion to become the Patriarch of the 
Church? No, he did not. Why? Be- 
cause he realized it was the mind and 
will of God ,and instead of being a step 
backward in the Church, it was a step 
forward; in other words, it was a step 
into another department which was 
equally honorable. More than that, it 



was the mind and will of God, and this 
should always be considered above all 
other things. Hyrum Smith went forth 
and officiated in that calling, and here 
is his descendant today, the Patriarch 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

Another thing. When I received my 
patriarchal blessing there was a clause 
in it which has always been a warning 
unto me. My blessing concluded like 
this: "I seal these blessings upon your 
head according to your faithfulness in 
keeping the commandments of God." I 
advise all you Patriarchs when you 
bless the children of men to put in a 
clause of this kind, because, as I have 
said, the blessings and powers of 
heaven are inseparably connected with 
the Priesthood, and they can only be 
controlled and handled upon the princi- 
ple of righteousness. The young man 
said to Jesus, "What shall I do to be 
saved?" Jesus told him to sell all his 
goods, give them to the poor, and follow 
him. That was the condition. When 
Jesus promised a blessing to the in- 
dividual or the people he always added 
something that they should do to secure 
the blessing. Said he, "Blessed are the 
meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven. 'Blessed are 
they which do hunger and thirst after 
righteousness: for they shall be filled. 
Blessed are they which are persecuted 
for righteousness sake: for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven." If you will no- 
tice, Jesus always put in a condition 
upon which the blessing could be re- 
ceived by the children of men. I sug- 
gest to + he Patriarchs that in your 
blessings you also add a condition. As 
we were told yesterday by President 
Lorenzo Snow at the opening of the 
conference, God will judge us by what 
we do and not merely by what we say 
I have known people to receive Patri- 
archal blessings which have not been 
fulfilled, and their sons and daughters 
have stood up in reproach and made it 
known that their father's or their moth- 
er's blessing had not been fulfilled. But 
I want to tell you that there would be 
very few Patriarchal blessings unful- 
filled, if those who received them would 
remember that no blessing can be 
vouchsafed unto the children of men,

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Saints cannot plead Ignorance as an excuse — A 
constant effort necessary— The Lord does not 
expect impossibilities of His children— What 
the Lord requires of His people i* the Word of 
Wisdom— Encouraging home industries. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having the 
opportunity of again assembling with 
the Latter-day Saints in general con- 
ference. I have listened with much in- 
terest and pleasure to the remarks that 
have been made thus far, and while I 
stand before you I most earnestly de- 
sire that the same good spirit that has 
inspired the remarks of the previous 
speakers may be with me. There is no 
other desire in my heart than that I 
may be able to say something that shall 
be beneficial to those who listen as well 
as to myself, and which may be calcu- 
lated to strengthen our determination 
to serve the Lord. I believe that every 
true Latter-day Saint desires to know 
the mind and will of God and to have 
the strength of character to perform, 
in the daily walk of life, those duties 
that will tend to advance the cause of 
God upon the earth. If we have not 
this desire in our hearts, then we are 
not true Latter-day Saints. 

We have the commandments of the 
Lord before us in the written word, and 
from time to time we have our minds 
refreshed by the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit upon those who are called 
upon to preach to us. There is there- 
fore no excuse for the Latter-day Saint 
who does not keep the commandments 
of God. We cannot say that we do not 
know what our duties are, because they 
are fo often and so forcibly brought to 



our minds by those who speak to us. I 
realize that it requires a constant ef- 
fort on the part of each and every one 
of us to make a success of our lives. 
It requires no effort at all to roll down 
the hill, but it does require an effort 
to climb to the summit. It needs no ef- 
fort to walk in the broad way that 
leads to destruction; but it needs an 
effort to keep in the straight and nar- 
row path that leads to life eternal, and 
we are told that but few find this path. 
The all-important thing for you and me 
is to discover whether we are walking 
in the straight and narrow r path that 
leads to life eternal, and if we are not, 
wherein have we allowed the adversary 
to blind our minds and to cause us to 
depart from that path w r hich will lead 
us back into the presence of God? Each 
one should search his own heart to find 
out wherein he has failed, and then he 
should diligently seek unto our 
heavenly Father for the assistance 
of His Holy Spirit, that he may come 
back into the straight path. By the 
assistance of our Heavenly Father there 
is no obligation and no law in the 
Church that we cannot fulfill. The 
Lord will give us the strength and the 
ability to accomplish every duty and 
labor that rests upon us in an accepta- 
ble manner in His sight. The only 
question is, have we the disposition? 
I heard yesterday of a Bishop who said 
that he could not give up drinking cof- 
fee. I do not believe that that man 
tells the truth. I think he lacks the 
disposition to try and give up the habit. 
I believe emphatically in the statement 
of Nephi. If there is one character 
more than another whose history is re- 
corded in the Book of Mormon who has 
inspired me with respect and with a 
desire to follow in his footsteps, that 
character is Nephi. When he came to 
his father's tent, after conversing with 
the Lord, his elder brethren were com- 
plaining against their father because 
he had asked them to go back to Jeru- 
salem for the plates of brass. They 
said that he required a hard thing of 
them. But when Nephi came, his father 
blessed him because he did not mur- 
mur. The record says: 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
said unto my father, I will go and do 
the things which the Lord hath com- 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



manded, for I know that the Lord giv- 
eth no commandments unto the chil- 
dren of men, save he shall prepare a 
way for them that they may accom- 
plish the thing- which he commanded 
them." 

This is the spirit that should animate 
every Latter-day Saint. 

They went up after the plates and 
were driven out. The elder brethren 
desired to go back to their father; but 
Nephi said unto them, "As the Lord 
liveth, and as we live, we will not go 
down unto our father in the wilderness 
until we have accomplished the thing 
which the Lord hath commanded us." 
They then gathered up their gold and 
their silver and their precious things 
and went up once more to try to get 
the plates. Laban stole their wealth 
and tried to destroy them. Nephi's 
brethren commenced to murmur again, 
and they took a rod and beat him with 
it. As they did so an angel of the Lord 
stood before them, and he commanded 
them to go up again, promising that 
God should deliver Laban into their 
hands. I call the attention of the young 
men and young ladies to this, for I 
have heard many of them say, "Oh, if I 
could only see an angel, I would be- 
lieve and forever after be faithful." 
The seeing of an angel amounts to noth- 
ing, unless you are keeping the com- 
mandments of God. No sooner had 
the heavenly messenger departed than 
these elder brethren, who were lacking 
in faith and did not keep the com- 
mandments of God, commenced to mur- 
mur, and instead of having faith in 
the promises of the angel, they said 
unto Nephi, "How is it possible that 
the Lord will deliver Laban into our 
hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, 
and he can command fifty, vea, even he 
can slay fifty; then, why not us?" Did 
this discourage Nephi? Did he lack 
faith? No; he believed in the promises 
of the angel of God, and he said unto 
them, "Let us go up again unto Je- 
rusalem, and let us be faithful in keep- 
ing the oommandments of the Lord; for 
behold He is mightier than all the 
earth, then why not mightier than La- 
ban and his fifty, yea, or even than his 
tens of thousands?" They went up and 
were successful. 

God has commanded the Latter-day 



Saints to keep His commandments. 
Ever since I can remember we have had 
preached unto us what our duties and 
obligations are. Well do I remember, 
when a boy, hearing President Brigham 
Young.in the conferences that were held 
in the old bowery, teach the Latter-day 
Saints their duties and obligations. I 
say as Nephi of old said, that God has 
required nothing at our hands save He 
will prepare a way whereby we can ac- 
complish it. What does God require 
at our hands? He requires that we 
shall overcome our selfishness; that we 
shall be honest in our dealings with 
Him, and that we shall pay an honest 
tithing. I want to make a little ex- 
planation here with regard to my re- 
marks that were quoted by Brother 
Smoot. Any young man who would go 
around and make the statement that I 
said ninety cents would pay more debts 
than one dollar, simply states what is 
not true. It is like hearing a man say, 
"I killed John Jones in self-defense," 
and then quoting him as saying, "I 
killed John Jones," and leaving the 
"self-defense" off. I say to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that God will bless the 
man who is honest with Him, and that 
the nine-tenths will go further and will 
bring down upon his head the blessing 
of God more than though he robbed 
God and kept the ten-tenths. That is 
what I said, and I repeat it. 

I have heard taught to the Latter-day 
Saints all my life that they should obey 
the Word of Wisdom; and I say that a 
Bishop, a father of a ward, who so far 
forgets his duty and the example which 
he should set as to break the Word of 
Wisdom, is unworthy to occupy that 
position; and if he does not repent, it 
is only a question of a short time before 
his resignation will be tendered to him, 
and he will have to accept it. The day 
is gone by when the Lord will trifle 
with the Latter-day Saints. He has 
said that His Spirit shall not always 
strive with man. In the very first sec- 
tion of the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants the Lord says: 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon sin 
with the least degree of allowance; 

"Nevertheless, he that repents and 
does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

"And he that repents not, from him 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



35 



shall be taken even the light which he 
has received, for my Spirit shall not 
always strive with man, saith the Lord 
of Hosts." 

We have been letting- out High Coun- 
cilors and Bishops that were failing to 
keep the commandments of God, and 
there will be more of them let out un- 
less they repent. It is a disgrace for 
a man blessed with the Priesthood of 
God and with a testimony that God 
lives burning in his heart, to be so weak 
that a little insignificant cup of coffee 
is his master. How he must swell up 
in vanity when he thinks what a won- 
derful man he is that a cup of coffee is 
his master! The example is pernicious. 

Now we desire that the Latter-day 
Saints shall be free from the bondage 
of debt. The Prophet of God has 
sounded the key-note to the people, 
"Pay your obligations, and do not go in 
debt." We pray to God day after day 
to bless and prosper the Latter-day 
Saints, and then we squander our sub- 
stance in breaking a commandment of 
God. There is today more money spent 
in breaking the Word of Wisdom than 
there is paid in cash tithing by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Very few of the people 
stop to reflect upon what good that 
money would do in helping their broth- 
ers and sisters to pay their obligations. 
The Apostle James says that faith 
without works is dead. 

"What doth it profit, my brethren, 
though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works? Can faith save him? 

"If a brother or sister be naked, and 
destitute of daily food, 

"And one of you say unto them, depart 
in peace, be ye warmed and filled; not- 
withstanding ye give them not those 
things which are needful to the body; 
what doth it profit? 

"Even so faith, if it hath not works, 
is dead, being alone." 

The prayers do not amount to much 
of those Latter-day Saints who pray 
for the Lord to bless and prosper the 
Saints that they may get out from the 
bondage of debt, and who at the same 
time go on squandering their substance 
in breaking one of the commandments 
of God. What does money do? Why 
a dollar of money has the same effect as 
a drop of blood in the human body. It 
is a circulating medium. It goes over 



and over and over again. We find that 
the heart of man beats, on an average, 
about seventy-six times every minute, 
and that it handles four ounces of blood 
every time it beats. In other words, it 
handles nineteen pounds a minute. Mul- 
tiply that by sixty, and you will find 
how much it handles in an hour. Mul- 
tiply that by twenty-four, and you 
will find how much it handles in a 
day. Over twelve tons! I have figured 
this out since I have been sitting here 
on the stand. Over twelve tons in 
twenty-four hours, and yet there is only 
about eighteen pounds of blood in the 
human body; but it goes over and over 
again. It is exactly the same with a 
dollar. It is calculated that every dol- 
lar does at least twenty-five dollar's, 
worth of work in a year, and I have- 
known it to do more than that in a sin- 
gle week. Now we spend nearly a mil- 
lion dollars a year in breaking the Word 
of Wisdom, and every dollar of that 
money goes out of this country. God 
said that the Word of Wisdom was 
given to the Latter-day Saints for their 
temporal salvation, and I say that if we 
had obeyed it we would be the richest 
people in this inter-mountain country, 
because the millions upon millions that 
we have spent since we came here in; 
breaking the Word of Wisdom would? 
have stayed right here in this country, 
instead of being sent away as it has 
been, and we would have had more 
wealth than any of the intermountain 
States if we had obeyed this simple 
commandment. 

I know that the policy of Pres- 
ident Brigham Young in advocating 
to the people that they support home 
manufacture and keep their money at 
home to build up the country, is the true 
policy for the Latter-day Saints to fol- 
low. I wear home-made clothes. I 
have done it ever since I was a little 
boy. Why? Because I believe it is- 
better for this community that I pay- 
twenty dollars for a suit of clothes than 
that the wool be sent East and bring 
only one dollar back. 

I believe it is better to have the nine- 
teen dollars circulating around here. I 
heard Bishop Farrell some years aero 
in the Assembly Hall tell a very 
good story on home manufacture. He 
said he believed in home manufacture

because it benefited him as well as other 
people. He said that when he was 
coming down to conference he met at 
the depot a brother to whom he owed 
five dollars for making some shoes for 
his children. He gave this brother the 
live dollars, and he turned around and 
handed the money to another brother 
whom he owed, and he handed it to an- 
other, and he handed it to another, and 
the fourth brother came up and handed 
it back to Brother Farrell, saying "I 
owe you six dollars, here is five of it," 
and Brother Farrell put the money back 
into his pocket. That money paid five 
hundred per cent in debt there in just 
about the same length of time that it 
takes me to tell the story. But if the 
Bishop had bought the imported goods 
it would not have paid the five hundred 
per cent, because it would have gone 
out of the country. I went to a negro 
minstrel show once, and there were 
about ten or fifteen on the stage. One 
of them rushed in with his hat off and 
said, "which of these here niggers am 
lost two dollars?" holding up a two 
dollar bill. There hadn't any of them 
lost two dollars. "Well," he said, "if 
none of you have lost it, I found these 
two dollars right by the door here and 
it is my money." They said all right, 
and he put it in his pocket. No sooner 
had he got it in his pocket than up 
jumped a nigger and said: "Look here, 
George Washington Jones, you owe me 
two dollars; pay your honest debts!" 
He handed the two dollars to him. An- 
other nigger jumps up and says: "Look 
here, Julius Cseser Brown, you owes 
me two dollars; pay your debt." He 
got it, and in this way it went clear 
round. When the last man got it, up 
jumps George Washington Jones, and 
says: "Here, give me back the two 
dollars; you owes me two dollar^ ' No 
sooner had he got it in his pocket than 
& fellow rushes in and said "which of 
■you niggers has found two dollars?" 
George Washington Jones took it out 
of his pocket and said: "Here, take 
your money and go home; we've all 
paid our debts." 

I desire that the Latter-day Saints 
should all pay their debts. One reason 
why I desire this is, I am in debt my- 
self and I want to pay my debts. I 
want to live to see the day when I shall 
owe no man anything. I want the Lat- 



ter-day Saints to not only pray for me 
but to keep a little more money in the 
country so that I will stand a better 
chance to get some of it. If they will . 
keep the commandments of God and do 
less praying, I will be obliged to them. 
I believe in the saying of the Savior: 

-He that hath my commandments 
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth 
me! and he that loveth Me shall be 
loved of My Father, and I will love 
him, and will manifest myself to him." 

If we keep the commandments of God 
He will love us, and the Savior will 
manifest Himself unto us. If we fail 
to keep the commandments of God, 
there is no promise made to us. The 
Savior said: -Not every one that say- 
eth unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter 
into the kingdom of heaven; but he that 
doeth the will of my Father which is in 
heaven." It is the keeping of the com- 
mandments of God that causes men to 
grow and to become strong and power- 
ful in the Church and kingdom of God. 
God bless you all. Amen.

A fundamental principal of the Gospel— The "great 
and marvelous work" — How to receive a testi- 
mony — Union among the Twelve — The Law of 
Tithing. 

I am exceedingly thankful for the 
privilege of attending this conference, 
and I think we can congratulate each 
other for the great privilege that is 
vouchsafed unto us in the redemption 
that ha.s been made for us by our Re- 
deemer. Jesus Christ said, "No man 
cometh unto me, except the Father 
draw him." The fundamental principle 
of the doctrine of Christ was that those 
who would do the will of the Father 
should know of the doctrine. Apostle 
James said: "If any of you lack wis- 
dom, let him ask of God, that giveth to 
all men liberally, and upbraideth not; 
and it shall be £iven him." We have 
tested these princiDles and I think we 
are highly favored in having the privi- 
lege of living upon the earth in the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, when 
the Gospel is restored. I have proved 
in my experience that if we will ask, 
the Father will answer. Before the 
Church was established upon the earth.

when it was known that there was a 
Seer in the land, men went to the 
Prophet Joseph and asked him what the 
Lord desired concerning them, and it 
was told them that a great and a mar- 
velous work was about to come forth, 
and that all who desired to take part 
in this work had the opportunity. The 
promise was given that if we would ask 
we should receive; if we would knock, 
it should be opened unto us; if we 
sought, we should find. At that time 
there was but one man upon the earth 
who knew that God lived, and the rev- 
elations that came unto him were very 
simple, easy to be understood. The 
Lord told those who desired to know 
His mind and will concerning them that 
it would be impossible for anybody to 
be engaged in this marvelous work 
save he was full of love and had faith, 
hope and charity, "being temperate in 
all things whatsoever shall be in- 
trusted to his care." When the Priest- 
hood was restored to the earth, those 
upon whom it was conferred were in- 
structed not to exercise unrighteous 
dominion, but, with all long-suffering, 
patience, and love unfeigned, preach 
the restored Gospel, entreat and warn 
the people. 

The Gospel came to me in a very sim- 
ple manner through a small tract — "The 
Only Way to be Saved." That, with 
the "Voice of Warning," gave me the 
first intelligence I had concerning this 
marvelous work. By the grace of God 
He led me into His Church, and gave 
me a testimony concerning this work. 
In my experience from that day to the 
present I have been enabled, in com- 
mon with those who have taken the 
Lord at His word and have sought and 
found, to know that the work which we 
are engaged in is of God and that we 
are living in the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times, and that this is the 
"marvelous work and a wonder" pre- 
dicted by the Prophet Isaiah. In the 
29th chapter of Isaiah we read: 

"Wherefore the Lord said, Foras- 
much as this people draw near me 
with their mouth, and with their lips 
do honor me, but have removed their 
hearts far from me, and their fear 
toward me is taught by the precept of 
men: 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to 



do a marvelous work among this peo- 
ple, even a marvelous work and a won- 
der'; for the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish, and the understanding of 
their prudent men shall be hid." 

It had a very small beginning. Two 
men— Joseph Smith and Oliver Cow- 
d ery — were ordained to the Aaronie 
Priesthood by John the Baptist. They 
were ordained to the Apostleship by 
Peter, James and John. From that 
very small beginning, look at the won- 
derful work that our Father has doner 
This vast body of people here, in sol- 
emn assembly, members of the Church' 
of Jesus Christ, is evidence of what 
the Lord has done. The Latter-day 
Saints have come from all parts of the 
earth, in fulfillment of the prediction 
that the Lord would gather His elect 
from the north, and from the south, 
from the east, and from the west, and? 
deliver them from the hands of the- 
enemy. What enemy? The prince 
of darkness. And God has given unto 
us a living testimony. We are not de- 
pendent upon others. We have been 
taught of God, and He has given us 
the knowledge that we have concerning; 
Him. For He is a God of revelation, 
and we know it. He promised that the 
signs should follow the believer, and 
they do. We know that it is by the 
grace of God that we have been put 
in possession of this knowledge; and in 
our experience and schooling, referred 
to by our beloved President in the 
opening of the Conference, we know 
that the Lord has sustained and is 
capable of sustaining us through all 
the vicissitudes of life and through all 
the persecution and ridicule we may 
have to meet. We know that He lives, 
and that He is a rewarder of those 
that diligently seek Him. I say there- 
fore that we can afford to be charit- 
able. We never would have known 
what to do if we had not humbled 
ourselves before the Lord and sought 
Him for knowledge. We had to be 
converted to believe that we would re- 
ceive, if we asked in the proper man- 
ner. We were told to ask the living 
and true God, in the name of Je- 
sus Christ, with humility in our hearts, 
and we would be answered. I know 
that that is true, for I asked and re- 
ceived. I know that the Church of 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Christ is a church of revelation, and 
that the spirit of prophecy is in 
the Church. Brethren are set apart 
to go upon missions and prophecies are 
made concerning them and their 
missions, and when they return they in- 
variably tell . us that every word pre- 
dicted was literally fulfilled. Who in- 
spired those blessings? Our Father in 
heaven, by the power of His Spirit, for 
He is doing His own work. Man is a 
manifest failure without the Spirit of 
■God. Take Paul for example, the great 
Apostle to the Gentiles. Under the do- 
minion of the Prince of Darkness he 
was a rabid persecutor of the Saints. 
But when he was under the influence 
of the Prince of Peace, Light and Truth, 
he was a very different man. While 
operating by his own wisdom, he was 
striving to bring men and women into 
trouble because they dared to worship 
the living and true God and testify of a 
risen Redeemer; but when he was under 
the influence of the Spirit of God, he 
was more valiant for the truth. Those 
who are opposed to us and misrepresent 
us, what influence are they under? 
What good does it do them? They waste 
a great deal of time and talent in vilify- 
ing the people of God and trying to 
make them a "stink in the nostrils" of 
all people. Do we vilify those who do 
not believe as we do? No, we have 
charity concerning them. We lay be- 
fore them the principles of the everlast- 
ing Gospel and plead with them to take 
advantage of it. We are the friends of 
the people, and we have traveled a 
great deal in their behalf. We are 
minute men. We go where we are sent. 
We are subject to our file leader. We 
sustain President Lorenzo Snow as 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator. We know 
.him, having been associated with him 
for a long time. He presided over the 
■quorum of the Twelve and he was anxi- 
ous to have us united as one man. He 
lias lived to see that union. He besought 
the Lord that this might be brought 
about, and the testimony which he 
bore yesterday shows that it has been 
fulfilled. He has only to express him- 
self that he wishes us to do anything, 
and that is sufficient, because we love 
cur Father in heaven, and we are de- 
voted to His work. Seven times I have 
crossed the Atlantic. I never went except 



when I was sent. I never ask any ques- 
tions, only that I may be where the 
Lord wants me to be. For I am so 
thankful to Him for the glorious re- 
demption He has wrought out for me, 
and I appreciate so much the knowledge 
that He has given unto me. To my 
mind He is the first consideration. I 
reverence my glorious Creator, and I 
worship Him in the name of Jesus 
Christ, as he hath appointed. 

I have a living testimony concerning 
this work and I persuade men to be 
reconciled to God, obey the Gospel, be 
kind to themselves, and make the rec- 
ord of a well-spent life. I show them 
the advantages that we have in being 
honored to assist in this marvelous 
work and a wonder. Who built the 
Temples in St. George, Manti, Salt Lake 
and Logan? Look at our meeting 
houses; look at our magnificent homes, 
Who has brought this to pass? Our 
Father in His glorious providences. 
If we cannot see and understand this, 
it is time that we had our eyes opened. 
He does not ask anything of us but 
what is consistent. I want to bear my 
testimony with regard to the law of 
tithing. I know that it is a correct prin- 
ciple. The Lord has done to me what 
He has said: "Prove me now herewith, 
saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not 
open to you the windows of heaven, and 
pour you out a blessing, that there 
shall not be room enough to receive it." 
In my experience I am a living witness 
that that is true. If any of us do not 
have this knowledge, it surely is a dis- 
grace to us, because it has been decreed 
in the heavens from the beginning that 
whoso would do the will of the Father 
should know of the doctrine, and that 
redeems us from doubt, ignorance and 
from death. 

I rejoice exceedingly in these princi- 
ples. I love my brethren. I love my 
President, and whenever he utters any- 
thing that he wishes me to do, by the 
grace of God, I hope to be able to do it. 
The only way that the Kinkdom of God 
will ever be established upon the 
earth is by giving- our hearts to God 
and by saying, "Father, thy will, not 
mine, be done." If we will listen to Him, 
keep His commandments, and walk 
humbly and faithfully before Him, He

will lead us back into His presence in 
His glorious kingdom, through Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Extensive ground covered by administration of the 
Eiders — A great field yet to b=i reached — The 
Lord will break down the barriers — Earnest 
aDd devoted labor necessary — Immediate re- 
sponsibilities of the Saints. 

At the introduction of this work, the 
Lord laid it upon the Latter-day Saints 
that they were to go into all the world 
and preach the Gospel unto every crea- 
ture. They that received it were to be 
blessed, and they that rejected it were 
to be condemned; and upon those who 
did reject it His judgments were to be 
poured out in His own time and in His 
own way. "When we think of the small 
start that was made, it is wonderful 
the extent that has been covered in the 
ministrations of the Elders from thajt 
time to the present. We find represent- 
ed in this congregation people of many 
nationalities, and in this conference are 
men who are defenders of the faith and 
expounders of the principles of the 
Gospel from Mexico and Canada, and 
from the various mission fields upon the 
American continent, where they have 
been laboring to disseminate the princi- 
ples of the Gospel. They are here to 
represent bodies of people who have 
received the Gospel. The growth of 
the work truly is a marvel to all who 
will stop and think of it. Nevertheless, 
only a limited portion of that work 
has been accomplished as yet. There 
are many countries in the world un- 
touched, because it has been impossible 
for us to make our way in them. The 
character of the governments that exist, 
the extreme prejudice that abounds in 
the hearts of people of various coun- 
tries through their lack of information, 
has led to their rejecting the Gospel in 
one sense, and has prevented extending 
the truths thereof as our Father designs 
they shall be extended among the chil- 
dren of men. As fast as openings can 
be made looking to the extension of 
free thought and free action, the Elders 
are carrying the olive branch of peace, 
backed by the word of the Lord, and 
fulfilling the obligation resting upon 
them. Wherever the effort has been 
made to introduce this Gospel and the 
spirit of intolerance has manifested it- 



self to a degree that has prevented the 
accomplishment of that work, our 
Father in heaven will, in His own time, 
have a controversy with those nations 
and people who so determine to hedge 
up the advance of the work which He 
is seeking to establish. Their rejec- 
tion of it forebodes to them trouble of a 
serious kind. It may be necessary that 
upheavals shall occur and changes be 
wrought that may cause bloodshed and 
confusion. The doors must be opened. It 
is the decree of Providence that such 
shall be the case. His children 
cannot be judged by his word until a 
knowledge of it has been sounded in 
their ears, at least to some extent. And 
if governmental matters are such that 
free speech is prohibited, and if words 
of peace fail to accomplish a change in 
these conditions, I am one of those who 
believe that in the providences of God, 
those governments will be scourged and 
humiliated in some form or another 
that sh ill lead to the opening of the 
doors whereby this Gospel may be 
sounded in the ears of the people of 
those nat Ions. 

We have accomplished but a limited 
Dart cf the great work that has been 
assigned unto us. It is true, some of 
the more liberal governments of the 
world have treated us with reasonable 
kindness and have guarded our rights 
as well as could be expected, consider- 
ing the prejudices that exist in the 
minds of people against the introduc- 
tion of any new idea, whether in manu- 
facture, in invention, in government or 
in religion. Especially are men slow to 
receive religious views that may come 
in contact with their inborn prejudices. 
Rut the work of Almighty God deliv- 
ered to the Latter-day Saints in this 
the dispensation of the fulness of times, 
has a destiny, the highest that could be 
imagined, so far as its extension and 
growth are concerned. There is no 
reason for us to doubt the fulfillment of 
the Almighty's purpose in regard to 
this, when we remember what has been 
accomplisned But a few brief years 
ago, in a village to the eastward of us, 
^ few uersons made a covenant with 
Almighty God that they would obey His 
will and meet the requirements of His 
Gospel. They plighttd their faith in 
the waters of baptism, that His stand-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE 



ard, v.nf ai led to the breeze, should nev- 
er be lowered in this world until the 
uttermost parts of the earth should 
hear the warning voice of a servant of 
God. We may imagine sometimes that 
we have accomplished the mission that 
was assigned unto us; but we have only 
touched the edges of the work. This 
work is to become the joy of the whole 
earth. Providence has decreed it. No 
power can stay its progress. It may 
meet with rebuffs; enemies may seek 
to hedge its way; barriers may be 
thrown across its path; but they will 
be blown out of the way as the wind 
gathers the straws and carries them 
from place to place, or as the breezes 
gather the ocean waves and whip to 
pieces that which our Father wishes to 
destroy. 

In order that the Latter-day Saints 
may fulfill the great destiny that God 
has designed for them, it will require 
an earnest and a most devoted labor in 
every given direction. We must exhibit 
our fidelity to him by the use of the tal- 
ents which he has given us, looking to 
the betterment of everything that may 
come under our influence, and in ex- 
tending the principles of right, justice 
and mercy as far as we may have the 
power so to do. No greater mercy can 
be extended to the human race than to 
carry to them the eternal truths which 
our Father has revealed, which shall 
point to them the way of life and 
open up to them an understanding of 
the ministry they should perform to 
make themselves acceptable to our Fa- 
ther in heaven. We may have thought 
that our work was nearly completed, in- 
asmuch as barriers seemed to be in our 
way in some nations, and the nations 
that had received us and given us so 
liberally of their people now seem to 
be but fields for the gleaning. We have 
perhaps forgotten that all this earth is 
covered with the sons and daughters of 
our God. and that while the nature of 
the governments under which they live 
or the prejudices in which they have 
been indoctrinated shut their hearts in 
some measure to the advance of the' 
Gospel in their midst, our Father's pur- 
pose in regard to them is that they shall 
have the privilege of hearing that mes- 
sage. And he will so shape this earth, 



by the sea heaving itself beyond its 
bounds, by wars and rumors of wars, 
and by the contention and strife that 
will appear in various parts of the 
earth, that door after door will be 
opened, until the seed shall be sown and 
the light of eternal truth be allowed 
to shine in the dark places and the 
manifest wisdom of the glory of God 
be seen which shall change the hearts 
of the people and lead them to a love 
of the principles of eternal truth. 

We are a people who believe in the 
continued extension of our doctrines 
among the people of the world. We left 
the village to the eastward; we planted 
our standard in Ohio, in Missouri and 
in Illinois; we have planted it beneath 
the shades of these grand old moun- 
tains, our "friends" pushing us forward 
to the accomplishment of our destiny, 
not recognizing the fact, and we not 
sensing it ourselves altogether, that it 
was the divine purpose to utilize us 
for the regeneration and uplifting of 
the human race; that from the moun- 
tain sides we should proceed in every 
direction, looking to the well-being and 
interest of our Father's children, her- 
alding His truths among the people, 
and thereby freeing ourselves from that 
responsibility which has been placed 
upon us. 

My brothers and my sisters, the field 
is before us, and that field is the earth. 
God's children are our brothers and 
our sisters, their rights should be as 
sacred to us as our own rights. It is 
laid upon us to carry to them the 
knowledge that God is their Father and 
our Father; that Jesus is the Redeemer 
of the world; that He has restored the 
keys, opened the door, pointed out the 
road, and selected us who have bowed 
to His shrine and recognized His hol^ 
will, to become the fore-front of man- 
kind in disseminating every principle 
that shall tend to the ennobling and up- 
lifting of man. To this end you have 
pledged your faith, your lives, your 
fortunes, your sacred honor; and to this 
end the men who have been selected to 
guide and counsel have directed their 
energies in the past and will direct 
them in the future, never slackening 
until the voice of truth shall be heard 
in every land and in every clime l 

We have not, in many instances, as

fully prepared ourselves for the ac- 
complishment of this duty as we should 
have done. We have not secured unto 
ourselves that species of education and 
prepared ourselves in an understanding 
of the laws and customs of nations suf- 
ficiently to fully qualify us for the ac- 
complishment of the work of sowing 
the seeds wherever opportunity might 
offer. But the oportunities will be 
given. Doors will be opened, light and 
truth will be shed forth, the stand- 
ard that our Father has thrown to the 
breeze will float in these lands and 
climes, and the truth will be made 
known, at least to such an extent as to 
free us from responsibility of their 
blood, which would rest upon us if the 
effort were not made to give them the 
knowledge that our Father has given 
the Holy Phiesthood unto His children 
and has turned the keys by which the 
dead millions shall be redeemed. He 
purposes the opening of the door of 
every land, that every human being 
ma-" have the privilege of saying yes 
or no to His word. 

While we speak thus upon these ques- 
tions affecting the interests of our 
fellow-men, we must not forget the re- 
sponsibilities that surround us. Our 
eyes should be upon the standard, 
watching its movements, and looking to 
the accomplishment of our Father's 
purposes. It was His purpose that this 
nation of ours should become the leaven 
of liberty that should leaven the lump, 
until every doorway should be opened 
for the benefit and blessing of His 
children. It is accomplishing its mis- 
sion, and His blessing will abide with 
it so long as the prospects of liberty 
and the opening of doors for His Gos- 



pel shall manifest themselves in its on- 
ward movement. 

May heaven's blessings and peace 
abound with you; may we love the 
truth: may we love the principles of 
liberty; may we love to extend those 
principles; and may we love the souls 
of men more than we love our own 
lives; utilize the talents the Father has 
given us, and see that men shall learn 
of His ways and walk in His paths, is 
mv prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER B. F. JOHNSON. 

My dear brethren and sisters, it is 
a pleasure that I did not expect, to 
have the privilege of standing here to 
bear my humble testimony to the truth 
of the words this day spoken in your 
hearing — the truth of the great fact 
that God has set His hand to the ac- 
complishment of the great purpose of 
gathering together all things in one 
in Christ. I feel to express my grati- 
tude that God has given me the privi- 
lege of living in this day of the harvest 
time of the earth — a period toward 
which all energies, all desires and 
hopes have been directed from the ear- 
liest times. I know that God lives; I 
know that Jesus Christ lives; I know 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
the Most High God. It is a pleasure 
to me to look around upon this vast 
assembly and say to you that this is 
my testimony, and that I know that the 
work in which we are engaged as Lat- 
ter-day Saints, is the work of God. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Light 
and Truth." 

Benediction by Elder Joseph W. Mc- 
Murrin.

Repent for the kingdom of heaven is 
at hand. 

Prayer by Elder John Nicholson. 



Singing by the choir: 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Uttered or unexpressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire, 

That trembles in the breast.

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

A paramount consideration — Good men should be 
selected for office — One-sided education unsat- 
isfactory — Exhortation to Stake Presidents 
and Bishops — A day of separation approaching. 

It is very gratifying to me to look 
upon this vast concourse of people. The 
building is crowded to its utmost capac- 
ity, and I rejoice in meeting so many of 
my brethren and sisters who have as- 
sembled on this occasion to worship the 
Lord our God. It is on occasions of this 
kind that the power of the people is 
manifest. When we come togethei 
united in our hearts in prayer to Al- 
mighty God, there is a strength devel- 
oped among the Latter-day Saints that 
forces itself upon the notice of the 
civilized world. There is a powei 
among the Saints, endowed as they are 
with the Spirit of God, that cannot be 
witnessed in any other congregation on 
the earth. It is not a loud and boister 
ous demonstration, but it is a cuiet 
power that penetrates to the hearts 



of the human family who contemplate 
the great work which this people have 
undertaken to accomplish, under the in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit, for the 
amelioration of the condition of man- 
kind. God has been kind to His sons 
and daughters, and especially so to 
those who have taken upon them the 
name of Christ. True, we are a small 
people; but if we do anything out of 
the ordinary it is heralded abroad to 
all the nations of the earth, and we are 
published from one end of this land to 
the other. 

I do not suppose that I could mention 
the word "politics" in this congregation 
without arousing the ire of some on the 
outside, and perhaps some on the in- 
side, and having to meet the remon- 
strance of manyof my friends. But there 
are points of doctrine, if you choose to 
call them so, which press upon me to 
that extent that I would rather main- 
tain silence than to be 
called upon to speak and 
not give them forth. Some things 
have come to this earth that are para- 
mount to all other considerations with 
me. The kingdom of God and His 
righteousness are beyond all other con- 
siderations that have ever entered into 
my heart. But what do these words 
mean? To me they mean that I will 
support the institutions that God sus- 
tains; that I will sustain the organiza- 
tion which He has so many times testi 
fled to me that He has inaugurated 
for the accomplishment of the sal- 
vation of his sons and daughters whom 
He has sent into this vast school of 
experience. Will I serve God, or 
will I serve Mammon? is tbe question 
that arises in my breast, and I feel it 
in my soul. 

If the hereafter is important to me, 
what is the condition of my soul today? 
I may have to leave this state of ex- 
istence any moment, or I may live for 
years. But what situation am I in? 
How does the Almighty view me as a 
man whom He has elected to bear the 
holy vessels of the Lord, to receive His 
Priesthood, and to assist in bringing to 
pass His righteous purposes in the lat- 
ter days? If I am not in a saved condi- 
tion this moment, I am in a bad plight, 
because I have no assurance that life 
will be lengthened out to me. I believe 
in laboring for my friends; but I have 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



no friend in this world that stands be- 
tween me and my God. Then if I have 
elected to follow Him, what will I do as 
one who has taken upon him this re- 
sponsibility? I tell you one thing that 
I will do: I will support good men in 
every position. I care not what prop- 
osition may be submitted to me, I will 
sustain good men. For it is written, 
"When the wicked rule, the people 
mourn." When the righteous rule, the 
people rejoice. In every condition, 
spiritual and temporal, moral, political, 
religious, and in every sense of the 
word, I stand before God as a man who 
has covenanted before Him and before 
His people, solemnly in sacred places, 
that I will sustain Him and His king- 
dom and people. I am not a covenant- 
breaker, unless I depart from the coun- 
sels of the Spirit of God within me. I 
seek to have that spirit constantly with 
me; and when there is any doubt I 
seek light from the source that He has 
appointed to direct me in the things of 
life, here and hereafter. 

Am I talking about politics? No. 
But I tell you one thing that burns in 
me, and I pray to God that it may 
never be extinguished. The last words 
that our late President said to me were, 
"Sustain good men, and put good men 
into office." Good men, not drunkards, 
not immoral men. None of this class of 
individuals shall rule over the Latter- 
day Saints with my consent, or by my 
vote and acquiescence. I ask you, 
Latter-day Saints, and latter-day sin- 
ners, men in the Church and men out 
of the Church, shall we have men who 
are just and upright, whether they are 
Mormons, Jews or Gentiles? Shall we 
have men who are honorable and will 
seek the interests of the honest of every 
nation and creed? Tou know as well 
as I do, that the perpetuity of this peo- 
ple, the perpetuity of the nation, de- 
pends upon the virtue that is developed 
in the midst of the people. It is a re- 
proach to any nation, or to any indi- 
vidual, to be unvirtuous. I feel for one 
that the day is come when the voice of 
this people shall be raised for good men 
to rule over us. What do I care about 
party feeling! A lot of men meet to- 
gether and get, up names, among them 
some shyster that has foisted himself 
into notice through some means or 
other of his own making, and they rush 



that upon me, and because I would not 
vote for such men two or three years 
ago, they said, "You are a mugwump." 
Well, I would rather be a know-nothing 
than to subscribe to conditions which 
will make me responsible for the actions 
of the wicked. I will not do it, I do not 
care who it cuts, nor what the conse- 
quences may be. I say it to the nation, 
I say it to the world: As God lives, I 
will never support a man that I know 
is a wicked man, for any office. The 
word of the Prophet of God has, been 
given to me, as it has to you, and we 
have got to take cognizance of these 
things. 

There is another subject — education. 
Educate our children! That is right and 
good. A great share of our attention is 
given now to educating our youth — and 
how? Well, I would not have to go far 
in this State to find an example. In the 
early days here we owned lots in the 
ten-acre field, and in the five-acre plat, 
and in the city plat, and we paid taxes 
on them. By and by harder times came, 
taxes increased, and we sold the ten- 
acre lot to pay the taxes on the other. 
Then the five-acre lots went, and by and 
by the city lots began to go. Here is a 
case of a badly balanced estate — plenty 
of realty, but no cash to keep up the 
current expenses. That is the condition 
in which our educational affairs are at 
the present time. We educate one side 
of the individual, and the other side re- 
mains unimproved. Why do I say tha. . 
Because all that goes to make the 
foundation of life, that builds 
up a country, and that develops the 
mines and the manufactures, is left out 
of the education. It is all letters! 

Educate a young man in mineralogy 
in our schools, and what does he know? 
Take him into the field, where you think 
he will be useful, and you will find 
that one of the most unlearned of men 
who has made a little practical study 
of this subject will go around him a 
dozen times a day. Why? Because 
the educated man cannot apply the 
knowledge he has received. Educate 
him as a surveyor. Well, he has to- go 
into the field to labor and practice for 
a long time before he becomes proficient 
in that department. The education is 
good, but where the school drops them 
we leave them, and the result is, they 
have to get some other occupation to

make a living. Where are the shoe- 
makers, and the manufacturers of wool- 
len and cotton goods? Is there a man 
educated in Utah that can go right into 
a woollen or a cotton factory and un- 
derstand the business? Is there a man 
that can go into the south and take 
up the business of manufacturing cot- 
ton goods? There is not such a man 
educated in the State, unless he is down 
South, and I doubt there being any 
there who could go into the cotton fac- 
tory and know what to do with the ma- 
chinery and the cotton. This is a 
languishing industry in Utah. 

There was an ox killed in one of the 
settlements, with a certain brand on 
the hide. That ox-hide was sold, and 
in about eight or ten months it re- 
turned to that settlement in the shape 
of sole leather, with the same brand 
on it. From the time it left Wellsville 
until it was returned here it had passed 
through the hands of eleven men, and 
we paid them for handling it. This is 
the system that we have been following. 
If it had not been for the mercy of God, 
who saw our ignorance and slothfulness 
and put it aside, this people would have 
been in poor temporal circumstances in 
these mountains. But I do believe that 
the time has come and sufficient in- 
formation has been given us, that if we 
do not take hold of these things and 
do them properly, God will make us 
responsible and we will suffer for it. 
I believe in education, but I want to 
see the boys and girls come out with 
an education at their fingers' ends as 
well as in their brains, that they may 
be able to support themselves. Take 
our girls who are educated and receive 
commissions to teach, and if they can- 
not get schools, what do they 
do? They clerk in a store, or do 
■something or other that people can do 
who have had very little education, and 
their time has been wasted, because 
their education has not been in the 
rigbt direction. 

I believe today that God intends that 
this people shall take hold of thest 
manufacturing institutions, and put 
•their sons and daughters to such laboi 
as is suited to them. Educate them 
in these things as well as in letters. 
If we do not do this, where shall we 
draw from for men with the capacit> 



to build up Zion and make it a perfect 
home It has been stated that Utah 
includes within her borders all that is 
necessary to make the people wealthy. 
But we are neglecting the very means 
that God had put in our hands to edu- 
cate our children in the right way. The 
time has come, in my opinion, when oui 
schools, instead of having so much in 
the line of gymnastics, should give 
good manual training. They are good 
to develoD the muscles it is true, if 
they developed them with the hoe r or 
the ax, or the plow, or something that 
is useful, it would do them more ^ood. 
If we could have our little farms, our 
blacksmith shops, our turning lathes, 
our carpenter's shops, our factories, and 
educate our children in these things a& 
they go along, we would turn out men 
who could be moulded and used for the 
benefit and unbuilding of the Zion of 
our God. Zion has to be built up, and 
we want men who are capable of super- 
intending in every department. God 
designs that men should be educated 
for this purpose. 

There are two or three more subjects, 
but I forget them. Perhaps I have 
said enough. However, I have said 
what is in my heart; and I say to the 
Presidents of Stakes, and to the quor- 
ums of the Priesthood, did you hear the 
words that were spoken by one of the 
brethren in relation to this matter? 
There is President Snow and his two 
counselors, and here are the Twelve 
Apostles; I testify from actual knowl- 
edge that these men are one, spiritually 
and in every way that Christ is one 
with the Father, to the extent of their 
knowledge. The Presidents of Seven- 
ties are one with the Twelve. Why 
cannot every quorum of Seventy be one 
with the Presidents of the Seventies? 
Why cannot the Elders be one, the 
High Priests be one, and all of us 
come together as one man. No, you will 
hear men say, I cannot do that; I can- 
not swallow that doctrine. Where does 
it come from? From the head. You 
cannot swallow it? It is the only medi- 
cine that will cure you. I wish that the 
great body of the Church could cleanse 
itself and be delivered from the corrup- 
tion which surrounds it. But we can- 
not just yet. Here, however, is the 
antidote for the ills to which human

GENERAL, CONFERENCE 



life is heir: It is to be one before God. 
I testify here today that unless we are 
one we will not be received by our 
Savior when He conies. 

Presidents of Stakes, when will you 
see that the Bishops do their duty? 
Bishops, when will you see that 
those under your charge do their 
duty? How long will you pro- 
crastinate? How many times 
will you have to be taught this subject. 
I say to you, brethren, in the name of 
the Lord, rise up and from this time 
forth see that your wards, your Stakes 
and your quorums, are thoroughly 
renovated, and that the people attend 
their meetings. If they do not, there 
will be a great deal of dropping off in 
the near future; for God will not submit 
to this land being polluted. I tell you 
the day is not far distant when you 
will see a separation between the sheep 
and the goats. I felt impressed with 
this when it was mooted the other day 
by a man who had a right to teach it, 
who said that the things before this 
people will try them to the uttermost, 
and we have to round up our shoulders 
and prepare for them, or, as God lives, 
we will turn our backs upon the Church 
of Christ. That is the condition, and I 
testify to it. How long will we hold 
back and say, "Oh! I am floating with 
the current; I go along as the current 
takes me, and . Brother So-and-So and 
I hobnob together, and I guess we are 
all right." Oh! you do not know the 
consequences of neglect. If you did, 
brethren and sisters, you would not 
neglect the principles that God has 
given. 

Brethren and sisters, God bless you 
in every particular. Do not let the 
summer pass and the harvest end and 
you be forced to say, Lo, my soul is not 
saved. Now is the summer, and when 
the harvest shall end let it be that you 
are in the kingdom with those whom 
Christ has established. May God grant 
eternal life to the people. God bless our 
Presidency, and the people, and give 
us strength that we may overcome and 
not do anything harshly. I have been 
cautioned by the Spirit not to do it; but 
it is all I can do to keep it down some- 
times. Do nothing rashly. Be moder- 
ate and wise in all things. Let God 
rule, whose right it is to rule, and He 



will bring all things out for the good of 
His people, if we do our duty; which 
may God grant, for Christ's sake. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Our labors relate to temporal as well as spiritual 
things — Temple work — Laws and ordinances 
administered now the same as administered in 
the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith — Law of 
Tithing — Necessity for greater Union— Home 
industries. 

I am requested to occupy the few 
minutes that remain of this forenoon 
meeting. I most earnestly endorse all 
the subjects that have been dwelt upon 
by the Apostles during our Conference, 
and I sincerely hope that these import- 
ant matters will find an abiding place 
in the memory of the people. We are en- 
gaged in a temporal as well as in a 
spiritual labor. You must continue to 
bear in mind that the temporal and the 
spiritual are blended. They are not 
separate. One cannot be carried on 
without the other, so long as we are 
here in mortality. The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints on the 
earth is a physical organization as well 
as a spiritual organization. We need 
practical faith — that is, we need to 
practice the principles of our faith. 
Without the practice of the principles 
of the Gospel we can never realize our 
hopes and expectations concerning the 
results of this great latter-day work. 

We are engaged in temple work. We 
have built four temples in this land, 
and we built two temples in the eastern 
country before we came here. During 
the lifetime of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
one of the two was built and dedicated, 
and the foundation of the other was 
laid and the walls had well progressed 
when he was martyred. It was finished 
by the efforts of the people under the 
most trying circumstances and in pov- 
erty, and was dedicated unto the Lord. 
The ordinances of the house of God 
were administered therein as they had 
been taught to the leading authorities 
of the Church by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith himself. The same Gospel, the 
same ordinances, the same authority 
and blessings that were administered by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and taught 
by him to his associates are now being 
enjoyed by and taught to the Latter- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

day Saints in the four temples that 
have been built in these valleys of the 
mountains. When you hear anybody 
say that we have changed the ordin- 
ances, that we have transgressed the 
laws, or have broken the everlasting 
covenants which were entered into un- 
der the personal administration of the 
•Prophet Joseph Smith, tell them for me, 
tell them for President Snow, for Presi- 
dent Cannon, and for all those who are 
living today who received blessings and 
ordinances under the hands of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that 
they are in error. The same Gos- 
pel prevails today, and the same 
ordinances are administered to-day, 
both for the living and for the dead, as 
were administered by the Prophet, him- 
self, and delivered by him to the. 
Church. So far as I know, there is not 
an ordinance of the Church now en- 
joyed or practiced that was not re- 
vealed to the Church by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I know of no new doc- 
trine that has been revealed. Princi- 
ples that were revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph have grown and developed more 
fully and clearly to the understanding; 
but we have received nothing new that 
I know of. Yet if we should receive 
something new, through the proper 
channels of the Church, we should be 
as ready and willing to receive it as 
we were or would be to receive the 
same at the hands of the Prophet Jos- 
eph himself. 

The law of tithing is no new doctrine. 
The revelation upon that principle was 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The only trouble is, the Latter-day 
Saints have more or less neglected to 
obey that law. It is to the credit of 
President Snow and his administration, 
and to the credit of the Latter-day 
Saints, that they have hearkened to his 
counsel and that many of us observe 
that law more faithfully today than we 
have done in years past. So far as I am 
personally concerned (and I think I 
could speak for some others of my ac- 
quaintance, although I prefer that they 
should speak for themselves), the 
preaching of the law of tithing within 
the last year and a half has 
made not one whit of difference 
with me. My tithing today is the tenth 
of all that God gives me. My 



tithing heretofore has been the tenth 
of all that the Lord has given unto me. 
It has been my pleasure as well as my 
bounden duty to pay my tithing to the 
Church every year on everything that 
the Lord has made me steward over. 
The man who does not believe in this 
principle ignores a revelation of God 
made known through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith. It is a commandment unto 
the people, with promise. It is essential 
to the temporal welfare of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The sectarian world keeps up their 
revenue by begging, by passing around 
the collection-box every time they as- 
semble for worship. They beg from the 
people for the maintenance of their 
churches. In their case the burden falls 
upon those who are willing to contrib- 
ute of their substance. -Chose who are 
not willing or not so disposed, bear no 
part of the burden. This is unequal. 
It is not just. Furthermore, it is 
a system of the world, devised by 
man; and if there were a blessing at- 
tached to the maintenace of their 
churches, those who were unwilling to 
contribute would, of necessity, not be 
entitled to the blessing. In the law of 
God more is not asked of one man than 
of another. The Lord has placed the 
duty or burden if duty with compen- 
sating blessings can be called a burden 
equally upon every individual. His re- 
quirement is a just one, and it is sim- 
ply to give one-tenth of what He gives 
to us as the reward of our industry, 
economy and perseverance. If my one- 
tenth is large the payment of it is no 
more of a burden upon me than it is 
ucon the man whose tenth is a small 
amount. It is only a tenth for all — no 
more, no less. The Lord requires no 
more, under this law; and the interests 
of the Church would, under existing 
circumstances, require no more if all 
the people would observe the law. 
Therefore, those who neglect this privi- 
lege neglect their opportunity to re- 
ceive a blessing at the hands of God. 
They are not law-abiding members of 
the Church; for a man who keeps all 
the laws, save one, and offends 
in not keeping that, he is a law-break- 
er, and he is not in harmony with the 
purposes of the Almighty. When he is 
-veighed in the balance, he must of ne- 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



rcsvsit;- be found wanting, because he 
has disobeyed one law at least that has 
been given for his own good as well as 
for the maintenance of the temporal 
interests of the Church. It is the law 
of revenue for the Church. We do not 
come to you begging, nor asking favors. 
We merely ask you to do your duty as 
we do ours, to obey the law of God as 
we do, and thereby put yourselves in 
harmony with the requirements of God, 
by which you help yourselves to the 
favor and blessing of the Almighty, 
and assist in maintaining the tempor- 
al interests of the kingdom of God on 
earth. 

We ask you also to be united, to be 
one. The brethren have said a good 
deal during this conference about one- 
ness. I believe in union. I believe that 
except we are one in those things which 
pertain to the building up of Zion, we 
are not God's children. But I want to 
say to you that we are not one. There 
is not that union amongst us that 
should exist; sometimes when President 
Snow tells a brother what he would like 
him to do, he at once turns on his heel 
and says that comes in contact with 
his manhood and his independence, and 
he ^refers to follow the bent of his own 
mind rather than to take such counsel. 
In that respect we are not always one. 
And I want to say that this lack of one- 
ness is not confined to the people. It 
reaches into the higher ranks of the 
Priesthood, if I have any power to dis- 
cern spirits. 

Let me read what the Lord says: 

■'And now, verily verily I say unto 
you concerning the laws of the land 
it is my will that my people should 
observe to do all things whatsoever I 
command them." 

This is the first point. It is the hub 
of the wheel. 

"And that law of the land which is 
constitutional, supporting that prin- 
ciple of freedom in maintaining rights 
and privileges, belongs to all mankind, 
and is justifiable before me; 

"Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, 
and your brethren of my Church, in 
befriending that law which is the 
constitutional law of the land; 

"And as pertaining to law of man, 
whatsoever is more or less than these, 
cometh of evil. 

"I, the Lord God, make you free, 
therefore ye are free indeed; and the 
law also maketh you free; 



"Nevertheless, when the wicked rule 
the people mourn; 

"Wherefore, honest men, and wise 
men, should be sought for diligently, 
and good men and wise men ye should 
observe to uphold; otherwise whatso- 
ever is less than these cometh of evil." 

The question in my mind is this: 
Who is to judge who are the good men 
and the wise men? If you leave me 
to judge, I say one man; if you leave 
Brother Brigham to judge, he may say 
another man; or, if we leave it to the 
people to judge, one says this is the 
wise man, and another says that is the 
wise man. The question with me is: 
Am I in a frame of mind, that when 
I get the word of the Lord as to who 
is the right man, will I obey it, no 
matter if it does come contrary to my 
convictions or predilections? If I 
reel that I can obey the word of God 
on this matter, then I am in harmony 
with the spirit of the work of God. If 
I cannot do it, I am not in harmony 
with that spirit. 

We believe in home industry. We 
believe in self-protection. We want 
the people to patronize home indus- 
tries, that they may not languish or 
fail in our midst. Today we have a 
woolen factory down in Provo. It has 
been there for many years. President 
Young was the practical founder of it. 
He inaugurated it. What for? That 
we might make our own blankets, and 
not have to import them; that we 
might make our own wearing ap- 
parel, employ our own people, keep our 
money at home, and grow wealthy, as 
the Lord has designed we should. But 
what is the result? Eighty-five per cent 
of the goods manufactured at that fac- 
tory has to find a market in the 
east, or west, for the want of 
support at home. We have to 
send our goods abroad to sell them. 
Think of it! only fifteen per 
cent of the product of the woolen mills 
at Provo are consumed by the people at 
home; and yet that factory has not ca- 
pacity enough to furnish one-half of 
what the people here require— not one- 
o.uarter, Brother Smoot says, and he 
knows. How loyal we are to the prin- 
ciples that have been taught us by 
Brigham Young! How loyal we are to 
our own interests! Are you not ashamed 
of these facts? I wear home-made 



ELDER J. W. McMURRIN.

clothes, and I am proud of them. I 
have worn but little else for years. If 
I have to pay a little more for them 
than for eastern goods — which I do not 
think I do — they are more serviceable, 
and it is far cheaper in the long run. 
But no! Some of our people would 
rather buy shoddy from the east, made 
by eastern workmen from rags gathered 
from pest houses and from the gutters, 
and ground up and mixed into your 
cloth that you buy from the world. 
You would rather have this than pat- 
ronize home manufacture. Are you 
ashamed of my appearance? These 
clothes that I wear are of home-made 
cloth; the wool is from Utah sheep, 
made up by Utah workmen at the Provo 
factory; and the clothes themselves 
were cut and made by Utah tailors at 
John C. Cutler's. I am not ashamed of 
them. I therefore admonish you to look 
to our home industries. Not only is the 
Provo factory manufacturing goods; 
but there are factories elsewhere. There 
is one in Ogden, another in Logan and 
still others on a small scale. They all 
are struggling against great odds, be- 
cause the people are not in sympathy 
with them; in fact, they .discriminate 
against them by buying their shoddy 
goods from the east instead of patron- 
izing home industries. I am ashamed 
of that conduct. I think every honest 
and intelligent man ought to be ashamed 
of such conduct. We ought to be loyal 
enough to one another to sustain our- 
selves and make ourselves independent. 
God bless you. Amen.

ing" was sung by Sister Luella Ferrin 
and the choir.

OVERFLOW MEETING IN THE AS- 
SEMBLY HALL. 

Owing to the large body of people un- 
able to gain access to the Tabernacle, 
ar overflow meeting was held in the As- 
sembly Hall in the afternoon, begin- 
ning at 2 p. m., at which Elder Heber 
J. Grant, of the quorum of the Apostles, 
presided. 

The Temple choir and congregation 
sang: 



Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion. 

Prayer by Elder George Romney. 
Singing: 

O, say what is truth. 

ELDER J. W. McMURRIN. 

The Latter-day Saints a free people — A word to 
the Missionaries — Danger of becoming "rusty" 
in the service of the Lord — An age of oppor- 
tunities for the young — How to sustain author- 
ity. 

I am pleased, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to be with you on this oc- 
casion, and to have the opportunity 
of lifting up my voice in your pres- 
ence in testimony of the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, as it has been re- 
vealed in this age of the world. And 
I sincerely trust that while I occupy 
this position I may be blessed of the 
Lord and have the inspiration of His 
Spirit resting upon me; for without 
that Spirit I know that my words 
would be as a sounding brass or as a 
tinkling cymbal in the midst of this 
great body of people. But on the other 
hand I also know that when men speak 
by the promptings of the Spirit of the 
Lord their words are of great worth to 
the children of men, not only to those 
who may hear the words that are 
spoken, who are in the congregation, 
but to the person that does the speak- 
ing as well. For all men are instruct- 
ed by the Spirit of the Lord. I feel 
that the people who have attended our 
Conference and who have listened to the 
testimonies and instructions that have 
been imparted by the Apostles of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, know in their hearts 
that the brethren have been inspired 
and that they have not been giving 
them anything that has been cunningly 
devised, but that they have been deliv- 
ering the word of the Lord, and the 
power of God has been made manifest 
in the utterances of His servants. 
There should be with us as a people a 
disposition to receive the coun- 
sels that have been imparted, and 
an anxiety that we may be in harmony 
with the servants of the Lord who have 
been chosen to direct the affairs of His 
Church in these times. It is a glorious 
thing to have the feeling in our hearts 
that we are in accord with the authority 
of the Lord and to feel, inasmuch as 
we have put our hands to the plow and 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have entered into covenant with the 
Lord to serve Him and to keep His 
commandments,that the keeping of His 
commandments is the greatest desire 
that we have, and that we have no 
other God before the Lord, our 
God; that we have not set our af- 
fections upon any other thing, but 
that we have an eye. single to the keep- 
ing of the commandments of the Lord 
and a determination to sustain and up- 
hold His Priesthood. I take it that this 
is a very grave responsibility, and that 
men and women who have entered in- 
to covenant with the Lord should ex- 
amine themselves and seek to put 
themselves in such a condition that 
they would have the Spirit of the Lord, 
that when we hear the voice of the 
Good Shepherd we will be able to un- 
derstand it, and have a disposition to 
be in line with the authority that God 
has upon the earth. 
. The rights, independence and liberty 
of no man can be infringed upon in the 
keeping of the commandments of God. 
We hear when we are away from home 
as missionaries among the nations 
many things concerning the bondage of 
the people, that we are priest-ridden, 
and that we are not allowed to do the 
things that we desire to do; but we 
know by our own experiences that 
this is not the case. I know as an in- 
dividual, having been born and reared 
in the midst of this people, that no man, 
no authority, no priest, or apostle, or 
president has ever attempted in the 
slightest degree to interfere with the 
liberty that God has given me. I have 
had as g^eat liberty in the 
midst of the Latter-day Saints 
as any man could possibly enjoy upon 
the face of the earth. When I bear 
this testimony I realize and understand 
that in this great congregation of 
people every man and every 
woman who has received the Gos- 
pel and who is acquainted with the 
spirit and doings of the wonderful work 
in which we are engaged know that 
what I say is true. Tou all know it, be- 
cause you have all had the same experi- 
ence, every member of the Church 
knows that we are a free people. 

I have thought in listening to the re- 
marks that have been made by some of 
the brethren, that there might be some- 



thing said to the missionaries. A good 
many things have been said regarding 
the teaching of the Gospel and the send- 
ing of men abroad to lift up their testi- 
monies in defense of the truth; and it 
falls to my lot occasionally, in fact quite 
often, to travel among the people and 
to associate with missionaries and to 
be in the company of men who have re- 
ceived authority to preach the Gospel, 
and whose special calling it is to ad- 
minister words of salvation to the na- 
tions, as they are directed by the 
Twelve Apostles. I often listen to the 
testimonies of returned missionaries. 
I have met a number during this con- 
ference, and their faces have been 
aglow with joy and happiness and with 
testimony concerning the work of the 
Lord, and they feel that they have 
spent a good and a profitable time while 
they have been away from home acting 
as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. And they have spent a profit- 
able time, have been filled with the 
power of God, and have been instru- 
ments in the hands of the Lord of ac- 
complishing a great deal of good. They 
have removed prejudice from the minds 
of the people, through the blessings of 
the Lord. Others have been converted 
to the truth, and have been made to 
know, by the Spirit of God, that mes- 
sengers of salvation, holding divine 
authority, have ministered in their 
midst. It is a good thing to fill a mis- 
sion. It is a good thing to have it to our 
credit that we have gone abroad in the 
world and that we have returned in 
honor without bringing disgrace upon 
our name, upon the name of our par- 
ents, or upon the name of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

But the performance of a mission to 
the nations is a small thing in the 
winning of the race upon which we are 
now set out for eternal life. Many a 
man returns from a mission who has 
valiantly maintained his position, who 
has stood up in the presence of oppos- 
ir~ multitudes and with the power of 
God resting upon him has borne tes- 
timony to the truth of the glorious Gos- 
pel, and his words have pierced the 
hearts and intellects of the people, and 
they have been made to feel that they 
were listening to the truth. Many a 
man has filled a mission of this charac-

ter and has done honor to the cause 
that he represented, but has returned 
home feeling, in a little while, that he 
ought to rest from the ministry that 
someone else should take up the labors 
here at home. I desire to lift my warn- 
ing voice to returned missionaries. I 
desire to plead with them in the name 
of the Lord, as I feel it to be my duty to 
do, and that it pertains to the respon- 
sibilities that rest upon me to lift up 
my voice and cry aloud to the mission- 
aries, the Seventies of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that 
they shall not seek for rest, that they 
shall not feel that they have accom- 
plished their salvation, or that they are 
secure, merely because they have filled 
a mission in the preaching of the Gos- 
pel. I feel when I greet a young Elder 
returning from abroad that the grav- 
est period of his life stands before him 
when he returns, when there is fear 
that he may become a little careless, 
that he may have a disposition to seek 
after the rest that many have sought 
after, and in seeking after that 
rest they have found not only rest 
but rust. They are becoming rusty in 
the service of the Lord, and 
they are not willing to labor at 
home as they did abroad. What a glor- 
ious feeling we have had, when we have 
gone away from our homes, impelled by 
the spirit of truth, to preach the Gos- 
pel among the children of men. I sup- 
pose that every missionary that re- 
sponds to an appointment, goes away 
from his family and friends with 
a determination in his heart 
that he will do honor to his call- 
ing. I have met hundreds of mission- 
aries in the old country, sometimes 
boys who have beep indifferent to the 
responsibilities of the Priesthood at 
home; but I do not now recall having 
ever met one in all the hundreds with 
whom I have been brought in contact 
v/ho reached the missionary field with 
a feeling of indifference, with a disposi- 
tion to oppose authority, with a feeling 
in his heart that he would question the 
counsels of the men who presided over 
him. You who have filled missions 
know that you go into the world with 
these thoughts uppermost from the very 
moment that you respond, that you will 
be obedient, that you will hearken to 



counsel, that you will be zealous in car- 
rying out counsel, and that you will 
keep yourself clean and pure, and 
tweet before the world. What is the 
result? Men return who have never 
had experience before, and they are 
filled with the power of God, filled with 
the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ 
and it is this testimony and this vigor, 
and this life that I feel anxious that the 
brethren should preserve within them 
after having returned home. It can be 
preserved, it can be maintained 
through their entire lives, if they will 
only return with a determination to 
hearken to counsel and be obedient to 
those who preside in the Church and be 
diligent in the discharge of the duties 
that rest upon them. In traveling and 
visiting among the people, when talk- 
ing to the Bishops about returned 
missionaries with whom I have been ac- 
quainted, asking how they were doing 
in their callings at home, the answer 
has often been given, "they are not do- 
ing anything." Brother So and So 
"will not act as a Teacher, he will not 
act in the Sunday school, he will not 
act in the Improvement associations. 
He returned and bore us a good testi- 
mony, but we have seen but little of 
him since that time." 

I plead, in the name of the Lord, with 
young men. Great and glorious oppor- 
tunities are before them. This is an 
age of opportunities for young men. 
The Priesthood, the Apostles, the Pres- 
idency of the Church, are conferring 
honois upon the young men of Israel, 
paths are opening on every hand in 
which we can labor, opportunities are 
being made everywhere wherein we can 
work for the advancement of the work 
of the Lord and for the salvation of 
the souls of men and women here at 
home. When we are abroad we some- 
times travel ten miles to attend a meet- 
ing, and would a hundred miles, if 
need be, that we may meet with some 
one that would be willing to listen to 
the testimony we have concerning the 
Gospel, that we might explain the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. And how our 
hearts are aglow, and we are filled with 
the Are of the Holy Ghost when men 
listen, when we see that they are con- 
vinced of the truth. What a dreadful 
thirg it is after being abroad and be- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing filled with this happiness, that we 
should return home to smoulder away 
and die, become indifferent and cold to 
the duties that rest upon us! I plead 
with Bishops, and I plead with the 
presidents of Quorums and with the 
presidents of Stakes, to throw their 
arms around returning missionaries, 
young men; to point out the troubles 
that are in their paths, the temptations 
that will beset them, the fearfulness of 
turning away from the path of duty and 
of becoming careless and neglectful 
concerning the things of God. We 
ought not to return and feel that we 
have given to the Lord two years or 
more of our time, and that now 
we will be justified in seeking 
after the things of the world 
to the exclusion of the things per- 
taining to our duties. But we should 
be more anxious, if anything, when 
we return to set a goodly example be- 
fore the people, that when the young 
men and young women, who have 
known us when we have not been so 
careful and so diligent, look upon us in a 
year after our return — in ten years after 
our return — they will say, "Surely the 
power of God came to that man. The 
testimony of the Lord Jesus was given 
him, and when he returned and bore 
record that he knew this work to be 
true, it was a solemn truth, and God 
had given him that assurance, for his 
whole life and his conduct before us, 
ever since he has returned, has testified 
all the time that he had a knowledge of 
the truth of the Gospel." And we should 
not have to bear the responsibility of 
testifying to the truth before the peo- 
ple and then turning away from the 
path of duty. 

God bless the missionaries at home 
find abroad wherever they may be; 
bless those who have returned and who 
are returning, that they may be filled 
with the missionary spirit at home, for 
there is need of the missionary spirit 
in all the wards and stakes of Zion. 
There is need at home for men who are 
devoted to the work of the Lord, and 
who feel that it is of the utmost import- 
ance all the time. It is a glorious 
thought that we are given to the Lord, 
that we are given to the accomplishment 
of His work, and that we have the cour- 
age and determination to hearken to 



the counsel of the Lord, and honor the 
Lord by the observance of His laws 
upon the earth and by sustaining the 
authority of His holy Priesthood. We 
cannot sustain the Priesthood by the 
mere lifting of our hands. The man 
who sustains the Priesthood is the man 
who responds to the appointments that 
are given him, the man who says "yes" 
to the Bishop, and to the president of 
the Stake, the man who responds in his 
quorum. The man who is always work- 
^g willingly and dutifully, is the man 
who sustains the authority of God. 
There is no other way to sustain that 
authority. 

May the Lord help us to seek after 
His spirit and to be filled with His 
power, that we may magnify our call- 
ings and accomplish much righteous- 
ness, is my prayer through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER JONATHAN G.KIMBALL. 

My brethren and sisters: One thing 
I specially like about our conference' is 
the plain talk that has been given to 
the Latter-day Saints. I realize that 
some of you have fairly crawled in your 
seats for fear the brethren would say 
something. It is a spirit that is creep- 
ing into the hearts of our people. My 
father once in preaching prophesied 
that goods would be as cheap here as 
they were in the streets of New York; 
and after the spirit subsided a little, he 
turned to President Young and said, 
"Well, President Young, I have done it 
now." President Young said, "Never 
mind, Brother Kimball, let it go." He 
didn't believe it either. But it came 
to pass. I want to ask you Latter-day 
Saints if. when men are inspired of God 
and you exercise faith for them, as you 
have done in this conference, they are 
to be always held accountable for what 
they say under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit. It is bad enough to be held 
personally responsible when a man is 
not under the influence of the Spirit. I 
have been fearful that some of us have 
become cowardly in our hearts in advo- 
cating the principles of the doctrines of 
Christ. I remember in laboring among 
the Elders in the Southern States, the 
question came up, shall we go when 
they tell us to go? Well, I said, if you 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL. 



53 



do you will all be home in three weeks. 
You ought to go when you feel im- 
pressed by the Spirit to go, and when 
you are not you are to hold the fort 
and let God take care of you. That 
is the kind of doctrine I believe in; I 
don't know whether I live up to it or 
not. I have a little boy at home. I 
didn't know how to train children, and 
when he was a little fellow we made 
him give up to every little child that 
came in to visit us, till today 
he hasn't got grit enough to 
take his own part, and we have him 
come home crying because somebody 
has whipped him. And now I have to 
go to work and train that boy to fight, 
if he ever gets on in this world. I have 
another little boy growing up, and I 
tell you I don't bother myself about 
these things. I believe in being loyal 
and true to the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and I believe in 
doing right. And I believe in men being 
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, 
and women, too. I don't know that I can 
tell you how I feel during this confer- 
ence, any better than to tell you how 
I felt whenil_was down to the Chica- 
maugua Park, when they were mobil- 
izing soldiers for the war. They mo- 
bilized forty thousand soldiers at that 
place, and one day I saw there nine 
thousand soldiers under dress parade, 
and I heard the martial music, and I 
saw them pass under the great flag of 
the United States, and every one of 
them doffed his hat when he came to 
the flag. My blood coursed rapidly 
through my veins, and I felt as if I was 
eight or ten feet tall, and that I would 
like to so to the war and see how it 
felt. I don't know how long the feel- 
ing would have lasted, but I never felt 
better in my life. I never felt 
more inspired with that kind of inspira- 
tion and loyalty to the United States 
than I did on that one occasion. It has 
been the occasion of my life, and , I 
learned that I was patriotic, that I was 
loyal, that the blood of the revolution- 
ary fathers coursed through my veins, 
and I was mighty glad to find it out 
I felt just the same way during this 
conference, and I wouldn't be afraid of 
all the world, all the devils in hell, if I 
could always have the same soirit of 



inspiration that has actuated me during 
this conference. 

It is getting so a man dares not to 
open his mouth for fear he will say 
something, for fear he will tread on 
what they term holy ground. I think 
we ousht to be wise, and I think that 
during the times that are coming the 
Latter-day Saints ought to keep their 
feet warm and their heads cool. 

I remember a time not long ago, during 
our troublous times, a very nice, promi- 
nent Gentile — he was very much aroused 
and excited about matters — who raised 
his hand in indignation (I guess he 
thought I would run), and he roared 
like a lion: "Keep your hands off from 
the State, and you see to it that your 
authorities do the same." I said look 
here and I wasn't very cool either — 
I don't think I had an overload of the 
Spirit myself. I said, look here, my 
friend, you were not born here like I 
was, in these mountains. I was brought 
up in the mountains. I don't know 
anything else but liberty, like the birds 
that fly in the air, and I love this 
country because my fathers and my no- 
ble loved ones are buried over here on 
the hill, over sixty of them. I love this 
country because I have been with my 
father as a child when he walked 
around the site of this great tabernacle 
before it was built. My father's oxen 
and his mules and his wagons hauled 
rock for that temple when I was a 
child. My father and my mother, whom 
I loved and venerated, came to this 
country as pioneers. I can't tell you 
about our temples, about our worship, 
about our marriages, about the Holy 
Ghost, about the Priesthood— I can't 
tell you, no man can tell you, unless 
you have the Spirit of God; but I want 
to tell you now, I shall not be cowardly 
and stop my tongue, but you must keep 
your hands off the Church, and you 
must respect the men that I honor, or 
you and I will no longer be friends. A 
man is a cowardly craven that will sit 
by for fear of trouble and allow men to 
be-little and abuse him and call the 
authorities of the Church everything 
under heaven. I don't believe in war. I 
believe in loving the souls of the chil- 
dren of men. But I tell you when 
you respect the authorities your- 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



self, other people will respect 
them, and the world widl. The 
Gentile world and the people of 
this city and State would have respected 
the authorities more than they do had 
our own people set the example. That 
is what I want to tell you, and I have 
told you, and I am not going to take 
it back either. ' I am not going to make 
any apologies because I have made that 
statement. It is true, just as true as the 
Lord lives. If you honor your wife and 
speak well of her, other people will do 
so. If you do not honor your children 
and you have a hired girl in the house 
and you do not treat them kindly, the 
girl herself will treat your own child- 
ren unkindly. 

Now I feel that we ought to honor 
God. "We ought to be loyal to our coun- 
try, and I believe that honest men 
ought to rule this nation, that honest 
and good men ought to rule this coun- 
try. It is a mighty poor time for us now 
to sit down and feel bad about it, if any 
mistakes are made. I want to tell you 
that while I am a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, I have my franchise, and my cit- 
izenship, and I have my vote, and I 
have a right to cast it. And if every 
single man and woman that is entitled 
to their franchise, instead of going and 
howling after the trouble is over, would 
shake themselves and realize that they 
are members of this great nation and 
great State, and go to their primaries 
and cast their ballot, I tell you mighty 
few dishonest men would find their way 
into our State and into the offices. But 
it is your fault, because we do not 
do our duty as American citizens. I 
claim that every man and every woman 
in this nation that has the franchise — 
that own property, that pays taxes — 
has a right to go to the primaries and 
see to it that honest men go into the 
convention, and then you leave the 
matter in their hands and let them do 
the rest, and hold them responsible. 

Now I pray God to bless you. I feel 
to be loyal, I feel to be true to the cause 
of Christ, and I want to be saved in 
the kingdom of God; and I want to go 
where my father went and where my 
mother went. I want to be with this 
people. I want to see all the world 



saved, and I want to see the Gospel 
preached to every tongue and people as 
a witness, anl I will be mighty glad 
when the end comes. May the Lord 
bless you. Amen. 

Sister May Young sang a solo. 

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

I desire, my brothers and sisters, that 
the words that I shall speak may be 
dictated by\the Holy Spirit. I have re- 
joiced exceedingly in this conference in 
the words that have been spoken to the 
Latter-day Saints, and I feel that the 
Lord has greatly favored the Latter- 
day Saints in giving them the instruc- 
tions that He has given through the 
mouths of His servants; and I pray 
that we may be faithful and true in 
carrying out these instructions that will 
be for our good and blessing. 

1 desire to raise my voice in warning 
to the fathers and mothers of young 
men and young women, who come to 
this city to attend school or to find work. 
I desire to caution them to see that 
they are under proper influences, and 
know something of the families that 
they are living with, something of their 
environments, for we are all influenced 
to a great degree by our surroundings. 
It is a -reat deal better or easier for 
us to do right and keep the command- 
ments of the Lord when we are under 
good influences; and it is a great deal 
easier to do wrong: when we are under 
conditions of wrongdoing, or where oth- 
ers set the examples. And especially 
are the youth, the young men and 
maidens of Zion, or of any community 
or of any people, inclined to be influ- 
enced by conditions which surround 
them. I feel that this is a very im- 
portant matter. There are things that 
are of more importance to the Latter- 
day Saints' parents than the mere earn- 
in*g of dollars and cents by their sons 
and their daughters; and the question 
ought not to be, when their sons and 
daughters come to this city, or to any 
other city, to obtain employment, "How 
much money can they get?" The con- 
sideration ought to be, in part at any 
rate, what are the conditions 
that will surround them in this po- 
sition or in this employment? 
I feel that great evil has come 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 



55 



through a lack of observance of 
this counsel, and through parents 
sending their sons or their daughters, 
or permitting them to go, to the larger 
cities to obtain employment in hotels 
and in families that are not good, or 
in other places where they have not 
been under proper restraint. It is a 
very good thing for us all to be placed 
under proper restraint. It is a good 
thing for us to have good influences 
thrown around us. Is it possible that 
fathers and mothers can, in view of 
these conditions that will surround 
their daughters, permit them to come 
into these cities, leaving their homes 
and natural guardians to obtain em- 
ployment without knowing of their 
surroundings and knowing that these 
shall be good? There are very many 
Latter-day Saints that cannot get help, 
either girls or young men. They can- 
not get the assistance they need on 
their farms and in their families be- 
cause they do not live handy enough 
to Main street, or because other con- 
ditions are not satisfactory to those 
who are seeking employment. I feel 
that it is the duty of every Latter-day 
Saint to know in what kind of a fami- 
ly their sons or daughters are living, 
where they are found at night, and 
what conditions and influences they are 
under. It would be a great surprise 
to many of the fathers and mothers, 
perhaps, if they were to walk down our 
Main street here some Saturday night 
about 11 o'clock and find, to their 
astonishment, that there were more 
young men and young women upon the 
street at that hour than can be found 
at any time of the day during any of 
the week days. Now, my brethren and 
sisters, many of you who have allowed 
your sons and daughters to come to 
this city to go to school or to obtain 
employment and think they are all 
right, that they are keeping proper 
company, you would be surprised, per- 
haps, if you personally would take a 
stroll down Main street and find some 
of your sons and daughters upon that 
street in an unseemly hour of the night, 
and not in proper company either. 
Young people who frequent the 
streets of this city, or any other 
city, at a late hour, with no 
other view than simply to walk up and 



down to be seen or to see, if they are 
not very careful, will lose their stand- 
ing in the Church of Christ, they will 
break away from the restraint of the 
parental home, and they will lose their 
virtue that is ten thousand times more 
dear to them than all the money they 
will ever be able to earn in their life. 

This is something that parents ought 
to give their attention to, for we realize 
that the devil is not opposed to im- 
morality. He is not even opposed to 
prostitution. The sanctimonious of the 
world are not opposed to these things. 
We have never heard in all our lifetime 
the great cries raised against prostitu- 
tion and such like vices practiced in the 
world that we have heard against 
patriarchal marriage. It was because 
this principle is of God; but the works 
of the devil are not found fault with 
by the agencies of the devil. There are 
very many in the world that are op- 
posed to conditions of restraint placed 
upon young people, but there is a large 
majority of the sons and daughters of 
God upon the earth that consider laxity 
in these things to be of a very grave 
character, because the devil is pleased 
with such as yield to such things. We 
are told that we are the servants of 
whosoever we list to obey. If we list 
to obey the teachings of God and His 
counsels, we are the servants or the 
handmaidens of God. If we list to obey 
satan, we are satan's servants. I feel 
that the conditions that are arising in 
some quarters in this city and in other 
cities, are alarming, and fathers and 
mothers ought to give their attention 
to these things. They ought to try 
to keep their sons and daughters under * 
a proper influence and from improper 
associates. You may feel that they are 
all right, that you have trusted them, 
and probably many of them can be 
trusted; but it is not a good thing to 
expose them to conditions that bring 
them into temptation and danger, that 
are against morality, virtue, honesty 
and truth. 

I believe that sorrow will be brought 
to many of the homes of the Latter-day 
Saints if they do not give these matters 
proper attention. Your sons and daugh- 
ters had a thousand times better stay 
at home, if their clothes are not quite 
so good, than go away from home to 
be exposed to the conditions which are 



56 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



found in the cities, and wreck their lives 
and make themselves miserable and 
useless in the service of their God. I 
feel that the Latter-day Saints ought 
to see to it that their sons and daugh- 
ters find employment and lodgings in 
the Latter-day Saints' homes. And this 
is not boycotting either, for the protest- 
ants and the Catholics do it, and no 
fault is found with them. And we are 
just as free as any other people to ad- 
vise people what to do, and I do advise 
the Latter-day Saints to see to it that, 
their sons and daughters find employ- 
ment or lodgings in the homes of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, when they come to the 
city to spend the winter or look for 
work. 

I pray God to bless you and give us 
the spirit of this work in which we are 
engaged, and help us to do right and 
live faithfully before Him, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Lucy Grant and the choir sang 
"Beautiful City." 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

Dear brethren and sisters, I would 
have preferred to have heard from 
Elder Grant the remainder of this 
meeting, but he insists that I shall oc- 
cupy a portion of the time, and I hum- 
bly pray that our heavenly Father will 
bless me with the light of His holy 
Spirit that I may have something to say 
to you that shall be appropriate to the 
occasion. 

If there is one thing above another 
that impresses itself upon my mind at 
the present moment, it is the obligation 
that is placed upon the Latter-day 
Saints to preach the Gospel in all the 
world. A short time ago I was in Can- 
ada. While the weather looked pleas- 
ant, as we were passing along over the 
prairie a thunder shower came up be- 
fore we reached the village of Cards- 
ton. I believe it was a little more se- 
vere than anything I ever saw or heard. 
During the progress of the storm it 
killed eight or ten head of cattle and a 
similar number of horses, knocked 
senseless Brother Jenson and all hie 
family, set his house on fire, killed his 
dogs, knocked to pieces a few telegraph 
poles and scared everybody pretty near 
to death. I was out in the buggy, and 
I know what my feelings were. How 



easy, I thought, it would be for one of 
those bolts of lightning to strike us. 
We could see the electricity running 
along on the barbed wire as we passed 
by a ranch, and a great many places the 
lightning struck. 

Now, I say to you young men who are 
under the sound of my voice, lightning 
is going to strike all through this coun- 
try. The next day when we were in a 
public meeting, getting up a subscrip- 
tion to furnish a few farmers with teams 
— they having lost theirs during the 
storm — I asked the people if they would 
not subscribe and give a few cattle and 
horses; sufficient were obtained in a 
few moments, and arrangements were 
made to furnish teams to those who 
had lost theirs. Lightning is 
going to strike all over this country in 
a short time. 

In regard to preaching this Gospel, 
I will tell you how I look at it. The 
Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
"Go ye into all the world and preach 
the Gospel to every creature, to every 
nation." He had renewed unto him 
the same commission that was given 
unto the ancient Apostles. How far 
have we obeyed this commandment? 
We have spent most of our time in 
Scandinavia and in the British isles, 
and more recently in the United States. 
There are hundreds of millions of peo- 
ple that have never heard the Gospel. 
How long will it be before the Lord 
comes? I don't believe He will ever 
come until the sound of this Gospel 
goes into all the world, to every crea- 
ture. How long will He have to 
postpone His coming if we do not make 
faster progress than we are making 
at the present time? 

I feel to continue in the strain of 
Elder McMurrin's remarks for a few 
minutes, and speak of the Elders of 
Israel here at home. I would say to 
you, Elders, do not be surprised if you 
are called again. President Snow an- 
nounced to the Twelve the other day 
that he expected them to open up the 
doors of the Gospel unto other nations 
of the earth where it had not before 
been. What does that mean? It 
means that where only one of the 
Twelve goes there will hundreds — 
possibly thousands — of Elders go.soon- 
er or later. While the brethren were

going over the various nations where 
the Gospel had not been preached, they 
spoke of Russia, of Prussia and of 
Hungary, and they spoke also of Per- 
sia and of Austria and of those na- 
tions that are in central Europe. Be- 
sides, we have all South America, 
which is being settled up by the white 
races to a very great extent. "We have 
all of Africa. The Gospel must go to 
Africa just as well as to 
the white people wherever they 
are. We have all of the 
numerous nations of India to preach 
the Gospel to. And I may say that in 
the southern part of Africa today there 
are many millions of intelligent people 
to whom the Gospel must be preached. 
And some of the best families of theLat- 
ter-day Saints were gathered from 
South Africa in early days. It is true 
we are preaching a little in Australia 
and in New Zealand, and upon the Pa- 
cific Islands, and have made consider- 
able progress in those places, but we 
have only made a start. That you may 
comprehend the importance of doing 
our duty in this respect, let me show 
you the value that our Lord and Savior 
placed upon the preaching of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. On one occasion there 
were certain young men who had been 
faithful in keeping the commandments. 
I refer to several of His Apostles. And 
they came to Him and they wanted to 
get their reward, and He said to Peter, 
the Apostle: "Peter, what desirest thou 
of me?" And Peter said: "I would that 
I might return speedily with Thee into 
Thy Father's kingdom." And He asked 
John, "What desirest thou?" John an- 
swered, "I would that I might tarry 
upon the earth to bring souls unto Thee 
until Thou comest again in Thy glory." 
Then Jesus turned again to Peter and 
said, "Blessed art thou Peter, for thou 
hast desired a good thing, and it shall 
be given unto thee even in accordance 
with thy desire." But, turning unto 
John He said, "More blessed is my ser- 
vant. John, because he desires to tarry 
upon the earth to bring souls unto me, 
and to do a greater work than he has 
yet done, and verily, I say unto you, I 
will make him a flaming sword of fire 
and a ministering angel unto all those 
who shall be heirs of salvation to them 
that dwell upon the earth, and to you 



(referring to Peter) and your brother 
James, will I give the keys to minister 
unto him," and He committed this min- 
istry unto these three men. Here is a 
good example, showing that the preach- 
ing of the everlasting Gospel was great- 
er than to go into the kingdom of our 
God and to dwell with Him 
with the Father. Why? Is 
there any reason given for 
this? Yes, we have a reason here 
in a revelation given to Oliver Cowdery 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
The Lord says: "I would have you re- 
member how great is the value of 
souls in the sight of God." For he 
says God so loved the world that He 
gave His only begotten Son that who- 
soever believeth on Him should not 
perish but have everlasting life. And 
He says, "If it so be that you labor 
all your days preaching repentance un- 
to this people and bring save it be one 
soul unto my Father's kingdom, how 
great will be your joy with that one 
soul in the kingdom of my Father; and 
if your joy shall be great with one soul, 
how great shall it be if you bring 
many!" Here is shown the value our 
Father and our God places upon the 
souls of of the children of men. Out- 
side of proving for the Latter-day 
Saints that are at home, and choosing 
men of wisdom to guide in the affairs 
of His kingdom, there is that great and 
mighty work to preach the everlasting 
Gospel to all nations, kindreds, tongues 
and people; and you are promised your 
reward. The Apostle Paul has said: 
"Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor 
hath it entered into the heart of man, 
the things which God hath in store for 
them that love Him and keep His com- 
mandments." 

We have been told by Brother Kim- 
ball that he saw the soldiers of the 
United States marching forth to war 
against other nations. It filled him 
with a desire to go himself in the 
armies of his country. I want to say 
to the Elders, there is a music that is 
prepared for the Elders of Israel in 
preaching the everlasting Gospel; yea, 
there is music which is prepared of 
God. He says: "I will send my holy 
angels before your face to prepare your 
way before you. They will be upon 
your right and upon your left hand to 



58 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



bear you up, and I will go before your 
face. The music of the angels is sung 
unto those who are in the ministry of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I heard Elder Golden Kimball say 
in the city of Ephraim, Sanpete coun- 
ty, that many of the Latter-day 
Saints are worrying about their sons 
for fear they will never return to the 
land of Zion. I would rather have 
every son that I have lay down his life 
in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ 
abroad, if it was necessary, than in any 
other field of labor that I can possibly 
think of, especially if they were labor- 
ing under the direction of the Presi- 
dency of this Church. But when a man 
is in the service of the Lord he is safer 
than in any other service. You may 
imagine you are safer here at home, at- 
tending to your daily avocations, but 
when you are in the service of God, our 
Eternal Father, all is well with you. 

Now, young men, prepare yourselves 
to preach the Gospel of repentance unto 
the children of men, for the coming of 
our Lord Jesus Christ is near at hand, 
and it will require renewed diligence on 
our part to go forth and fulfill our mis- 
sions and be in readiness for the com- 
ing of our Savior. He said he would 
cut short His work in righteousness. It 
is said that He will come as a refiner's 
fire and as fuller's soap, to purify the 
sons of Levi. We have been reminded 
here of the judgments and the miseries 
that are coming upon the nations. It 
is true as God lives. He says: "I will 
burn them, saith the Lord of hosts, by 
the brightness of my coming, and I 
will leave them neither root nor branch; 
yea, all those that are proud and they 
that do wickedly shall be as stubble, for 
the day that cometh shall burn them 
up." Take all those that are proud and 
all those that do wickedly from among 
the children of men, and there will be 
but few men left, and the words of 
Jesus Christ will be fulfilled in his 
prophecy in the 24th chapter of 
Matthew, wherein he says, "as in the 
days of Noah so shall it be in the days 
of the coming of the Son of Man." How 
many men and women were there that 
would listen to the Prophet Noah? 
There were but few, and I say that to- 
day, compared with the inhabitants 
that live, but few men will receive the 



truth; therefore, be humble and put 
away all pride, all vanity and nonsense 
of every kind, serve the Lord, and de- 
vote yourselves to His service. 

I testify to this congregation, that 
these men who have gone forth and ful- 
filled faithful missions, have not feared 
the world nor the things of the world, 
but the Lord has led them to the hon- 
est in heart, and the honest in heart 
have received the testimony of the Holy 
Spirit, and the gifts and blessings have 
been poured out upon them as a stream 
of living fire, for truly the promise was 
made, as said John the Baptist, "Be- 
hold I baptize you with water, but 
there is one coming after me who will 
baptize you with fire and the Holy 
Ghost. I have seen when your sons, 
the Elders of Israel, have preached the 
Gospel, promising the Holy Ghost to 
the people if they would repent of their 
sins and laid their hands upon their 
heads; I have seen people stand up and 
prophesy and testify that God lives and 
that Jesus Christ is His Son; I have 
heard them speak in tongues, and others 
have interpreted, not by the power of 
man tut by the power of God, and the 
signs have followed the believers. I 
know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet 
of God. I know that Lorenzo Snow has 
the inspiration of the Lord, and he is 
a Prophet, Seer and Revelator of this 
Church to guide us on to salvation; and 
I pray that God will bless him and 
lengthen out his years upon the earth, 
that he may live to see Zion redeemed 
from its bondage, and that we may be 
blessed and prospered as a people. Jo- 
seph Smith gave a definition in regard 
to those who understood the Spirit of 
God. He said: Show me a man or a 
woman who has the Spirit of God 
with him or her, and I will show 
you a man or woman whose greatest 
desire is to build up the Church of God 
upon the earth. Is this out desire, my 
brethren and sisters? I pray that the 
Spirit of God may rest upon this con- 
gregation, and that Elder Grant may 
be filled with the fire of the 
Holy Ghost, that He may speak 
as a man having authority and not 
as the Scribes and the Pharisees, 
that he may deliver the word of God 
unto us here this afternoon, and I pray 
that it may sink into good and honest

"hearts and bring forth fruit to the hon- 
or and glory of God. May God bless all 
under the sound of my voice. And if 
there are any strangers here, I invite 
them into the waters of baptism, and 
I will promise them that they shall 
know that God lives, and that He has 
sent us, His people, to gather His Israel 
from the four Quarters of the earth, 
and that the little stone that Daniel 
saw is rolling forth. Daniel said he saw 
a stone that was cut out of the moun- 
tain without hands, and it rolled forth 
and became a great mountain and filled 
the whole earth. He spoke of those 
who would oppose the progress of this 
rock, that they should be as the chaff 
of the summer's threshing floor, and 
there should be no place found for 
them. 

Blessed are the honest in heart. 
Rlessed are they whose hearts are to 
build up the kingdom of God. My 
testimony is, and it will always be, if 
you will sustain the authorities of this 
Church, God will bless you. If you do 
your duty, God will bless you and pros- 
per you in the land of Zion. If you 
do not do your duty, the Spirit of God 
will not be with you, and you will not 
be prospered. I say to the ungodly, Do 
not oppose the work of the Lord. It is 
not the work of Joseph Smith. It is not 
the work of Lorenzo Snow. It is the 
work of God, the Heavenly Father. He 
can raise ud a nation; he can cast it 
down. He can raise ud an individual, 
or he can cast him aside. I say unto 
you, my brethren and sisters, the words 
of Jesus will be applied unto them in 
their fulfillment, Whosoever shall fall 
upon this stone shall be broken, but 
whomsoever this stone shall fall 
upon shall be ground to powder. Show 
me a man that has ever lifted up his 
hand against the Church of God that 
today is prospered in the earth. May 
God bless us that we may be as our 
fathers, for the building up of the 
kingdom of God and for righteousness 
and virtue and purity and for the 
spread of the principles of righteousness 
to the ends of the earth, which is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 
I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
conference we have had the privilege 



of attending. I have been much pleased 
with the remarks that have been made 
in this overflow meeting this afternoon; 
and trust that the remainder of the 
time I may occupy, I may do so 
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. 

I love the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. I love to minister among the 
Latter-day Saints, and have had ex- 
quisite joy in this labor, and particular- 
ly have I rejoiced that upon some oc- 
casions I have been the instrument in 
the hands of God in touching the hearts 
of those who have grown careless and 
negligent in their duties, and they have 
seen fit to reform their ways and to be 
more diligent in His service than they 
have ever been. It requires a con- 
stant warfare on the part of every Lat- 
ter-day Saint, for him to make a suc- 
cess. We cannot measure the work of 
God by the things of this world. God 
tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants 
there is no gift greater than the gift 
of salvation. We as Latter-day Saints 
have all started out for the gift of sal- 
vation, and we should so order our lives 
that when we have finished our work 
we shall be worthy to go back into the 
presence of our Father, and be worthy 
not only to receive exaltation our- 
selves, but also to receive our wives 
and our children that have been sealed 
unto us that we shall possess them. 
No amount of testimony, no amount of 
knowledge, even knowledge that this is 
God's work, will ever save a man so 
that he will have his wives and his 
children, but the keeping of the com- 
mandments of God will entitle him to 
that blessing. That is the only way 
that they can possess them in the next 
world, for those they have will be 
taken away, unless they keep the com- 
mandments of God. 

I wish to call your attention to the. 
many failures that have been made be- 
cause of failure to keep the command- 
ments. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery 
and David Whitmer that if they lab- 
ored all their lives in brin^ins; but one 
soul to the knowledge of God they 
should have great joy. Notwithstanding 
this revelation, these men did not re- 
main faithful, notwithstanding these 
men saw the an^el of God; notwith- 
standing they gave their testimony to 
the Book of Mormon, in which they de- 



60

clare that they knew that the plates 
had been translated by the gift and pow- 
er of God, for "His voice hath declared it 
unto us; wherefore we know of a surety 
that the work is true." And again they 
testify that the angel came down and 
they beheld and saw the plates and the 
engravings thereon, and they say: "It 
is marvelous in our eyes, nevertheless 
the voice of the Lord commanded us 
that we should bear record Of it; 
wherefore, to be obedient unto the 
commandments of God, we bear testi- 
mony of these things. And we know 
that if we are faithful in Christ we 
shall rid our garments of the blood of 
all men, and be found spotless before 
the judgment seat of Christ, and shall 
dwell with Him eternally in the heav- 
ens." Notwithstanding all this, they 
failed to keep the commandments of 
God, and fell by the wayside. Take 
Sydney Rigdon, who was with Joseph 
Smith when he received that great vis- 
ion and revelation wherein it is de- 
clared that they saw Jesus Christ who 
came into the world to bear the sins of 
the world; and the testimony which 
they bore of Jesus was: "After 
the many testimonies which 
have been given of him, this is the tes- 
timony, last of all, which we zive of 
Him, that He lives, for we saw Him, 
even on the right hand of God, and we 
heard the voice bearing record that 
He is the only begotten of the Father." 
And they testify that they saw 
the angels and those that were 
sanctified singing praises to God. I say, 
notwithstanding they saw. the Savior 
and bore His testimony, this man Sid- 
ney Rigdon, fell by the wayside. I say 
to the Latter-day Saints, no amount of 
knowledge, no amount of testimony, no 
amount of sealing in the temples of God 
to our wives and children will save us; 
but the keeping of the commandments 
of God, being honest in our dealings 
with God and with out fellow men, pay- 
ing our tithing, obeying the Word of 
Wisdom and doing our duty as Latter- 
day Saints — these are the things, and 
the only things that will save us. 

What does the Lord say? "Although 
a man may have many revelations, and 
have power to do many mighty works, 
yet if he boasts in his own strength and 
sets at nought the counsels of God and 



follows after the dictates of his own will 
and carnal desires, he must fail and in- 
cur the vengeance of a just God upon 
him." It is easy for us to fail to be 
honest with Almighty God in the pay- 
ment of our tithes and offerings, and to 
follow the dictates of our own wills. 
The devil is ready to blind our eyes with 
the things of this world, and he would 
gladly rob us of eternal life, the great- 
est of all gifts. But it is not given to 
the devil, and no power will ever be 
given to him to overthrow any Latter- 
day Saint that is keeping the command- 
ments of God. There is no power given 
to the adversary of men's souls to de- 
stroy us if we are doing our duty. If 
we are not absolutely honest with God, 
then we let the bars down, then we 
have destroyed part of the fortifications 
by which we are protected, and the de- 
vil may come in. But no man has ever 
lost the testimony of the Gospel, no man 
has ever turned to the right or to the 
left, who had the knowledge of the 
truth, who was attending to his duties, 
who was keeping the Word of Wisdom, 
who was paying his tithing, who was 
responding to the calls and duties of his 
office and calling in the Church. 

May God bless us! May the teachings 
of this conference abide with us, and 
may God help all of us to be true to 
Him, is my prayer and desire. I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

tion of the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants: 

"And now, behold, this is the will of 
the Lord your God concerning His 
Saints, that they should assemble them- 
selves together unto the land of Zion, 
not in haste, lest there should be con- 
fusion, which bringeth pestilence. 

"Behold, the land of Zion, I, the Lord, 
holdeth it in mine own hand; 

"Nevertheless, I, the Lord, rendereth 
unto Caesar the things which are 
Caesar's; 

"Wherefore, I, the Lord, willeth that 
you should purchase the lands that you 
may have advantage of the world, that 
you may have claim on the world, that 
they may not be stirred up unto anger; 

"For Satan putteth it into their hearts 
to anger against you, and to the shed- 
ding of blood; 

"Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not 
be obtained but by purchase or by 
blood, otherwise there is none inherit- 
ance for you. 

"And if by purchase, behold you are 
blessed; 

"And if by blood, as you are forbid- 
den to shed blood, lo, your enemies are 
upon you, and ye shall be scourged 
from city to city, and from synagogue 
to synagogue; and but few shall stand 
to receive an inheritance." 

These words were spoken of the Lord 
to Joseph the Prophet in 1831. 

Now the time is fast approaching 
when a large portion of the people that 
I am now addressing will go back to 
Jackson county. A great many people 
that are now dwelling in the State of 
Utah will have this privilege. Whether 
I, President Cannon, President Smith, 
or all the brethren of the Twelve will 
go back I know not. But a large por- 
tion of the Latter-day Saints that now 
dwell in these valleys will go back to 
Jackson county to build a holy city to 
the Lord, as was decreed by Jehovah 
and revealed through Joseph Smith. 

A word or two about Joseph Smith. 
Perhaps there are very few men now 
Uving who were so well acquainted 
with Joseph Smith the Prophet 
as I was. I was with him oftentimes. I 
visited him in his family, sat at his ta- 
ble, associated with him under various 
circumstances, and had private inter- 
views with him for counsel. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
Cod; I know that he was an honorable 
man, a moral man, and that he had the 
respect of those who were acquainted 



with him. The Lord has shown me most 
clearly and completely that he was a 
Prophet of God, and that he held the 
Holy Priesthood and the authority to 
baptize people for the remission of their 
sins and to lay hands upon them for 
the reception of the Holy Ghost, that 
they might receive a knowledge them- 
selves in relation to these things. I 
am one that has received from the Lord 
the strongest revelation concerning the 
truth of this work. That manifesta- 
tion was with me powerfully for hours 
and hours; and whatever circumstances 
may occur in my life, as long as mem- 
ory lasts this perfect knowledge will 
remain with me. I shall never forget 
the first time I saw Joseph Smith. It 
was in Father Johnson's house, in the 
township of Hiram, in the State of 
Ohio, about twenty-five miles from 
Kirtland. It was near Father John- 
son's where the mob tarred and feath- 
ered him. When I saw him he was 
standing in the doorway. Before him 
was a small bowery occupied by about 
a hundred and fifty or two hundred men 
and women. There for the first time I 
heard his voice. When I heard his tes- 
timony in regard to what the Lord had 
revealed to him, it seemed to me that 
he must be an honest man. He talked 
and looked like an honest man. He was 
an honest man. 

Through this man, Joseph Smith, the 
Lord has said to us what I have been 
reading. As some of the brethren 
stated in their addresses here, I think 
that there was need of a reformation 
among the Latter-day Saints. I believo 
that that reformation has already com- 
menced. One of the evidences of this 
to me is that the Latter-day Saints 
throughout all the Stakes of Zion have 
done that which they never did before 
in regard to paying their tithing. 
They have paid twice the amount 
of tithing this year and last year 
than they paid two years ago. It 
is wonderful how the Saints have re- 
formed in this duty especially in view 
of the fact that the Latter-day Saints 
have always had trouble to reform 
themselves in money matters. They 
could not do it in the day in which this 
revelation was given. Joseph tried to 
develop them so that they would con- 



62 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



form to the law of consecration, which 
is in advance of the law of tithing, and 
is a principle which, as sure as I am 
speaking, you and I will one day have 
to conform to. When that day comes 
we will be prepared to go to Zion. We 
will not take possession of the land of 
Zion by force. If we should do, it 
would turn out to us as it did with the 
people who were upon the land of Zion 
when this revelation was given. As 
the Lord here tells us, there are only 
two ways in which we can come into 
possession of that land. One way is 
by purchase, "and if by purchase, be- 
hold you are blessed." The other way 
is by blood, "and if by blood, as you 
are forbidden to shed blood, lo, your 
enemies are upon you, and ye shall be 
scourged from city to city, and from 
synagogue to synagogue, and but few 
shall stand to receive an inheritance." 
These are the words of God. They did 
not come to us today, nor yesterday, 
nor last year, but they did come to the 
people of God some years ago. They 
came to the Latter-day Saints who 
were upon the land of Zion at that time. 
I do not know that it would be right 
to say that they are of more import- 
ance to us than they were to them. 
But there is this about it: The Latter- 
day Saints in these valleys have had 
an experience that the Saints then did 
not have. We have learned that 
which they did not learn. They were 
badly persecuted and driven forth from 
the land of Zion, and as the revelation 
says, "but few shall stand to receive 
an inheritance." There are some per- 
haps within the sound of my voice who 
will receive an inheritance in Jackson 
county before they pass into the next 
life. 

I have not heard at any previous con- 
ference such talk as has been given to 
the Latter-day Saints at this confer- 
ence. It is talk that bears upon it re- 
formation and preparation. When we 
think of the wonderful reformation that 
has been accomplished in the matter of 
tithing, it is a manifestation that a 
grand preparation is coming. Do you 
suppose that the Lord would ever 
send you and me back to Jackson 
county until He could feel per- 
fectly assured that we would 
do thoFe things which the people of 



Jackson county failed to do for lack 
of experience and faith? Jackson coun- 
ty is the place, the point that we should 
have continually in view. A brother 
the other day said that he had a thous- 
and dollars and he was keeping it to 
purchase land in Jackson county, as 
soon as it would be proper to do so. 

We cannot consider ourselves pre- 
pared, however, to go back to Jackson 
county when we fail to pay our tithing. 
I do not wish to say very much about 
tithing, for I think I have said enough. 
In the settlements that we traveled 
through coming from St. George, I 
talked very strongly about it, because 
I knew it was a command of the Lord 
that the people should repent and re- 
form from the great neglect that we 
had all been guilty of more or less. I 
felt determined about it then with all 
my heart and soul, and I did not know 
but that the Saints might think I was 
going a little too far. To ease their 
minds upon this I told them that I 
should never come again to talk to 
them as I talked at that time. But I 
said they must do what they had been 
told if they calculated to be Latter- 
day Saints. The reformation in this 
line has been effectual. There are 
some, I am told, that do not think it is 
right to pay tithing. That need not 
surprise anybody. But the great mass 
of the people are doing well in relation 
to this. 

Let us all exercise faith for the Lord 
to open the way that we may go back 
to Jackson county. A short time ago 
something occurred in this connection 
that was a little extraordinary. Two 
men came here — good, honest men, as 
I have every reason to believe — and to 
our surprise they wanted to establish 
a union between the Latter-day Saints 
and the Josephites. We asked them to 
explain themselves. They said they 
had received a revelation that the time 
had now come to build a Temple in 
Jackson county, and in order that this 
might be accomplished, they had felt 
it was their duty to go to the Jose- 
phites. They do not believe in the Jo- 
sephites any more than we do; but they 
went there and had a conversation with 
the president and counsel of the Jo- 
sephites. It was proposed that they

send four of their elders, that we send 
four of our Elders.and that the Hedrick. 
ites (to which body these two men be- 
longed) have four of their elders, 
and that all these Elders should 
meet on the land of Zion and see if 
they could not make some arrange- 
ment by which the Temple could 
be built. Of course, we could see very 
well that there was no use trying in 
that direction; but they seemed to have 
faith that it could be effected. In part 
these men may have had a manifesta- 
tion. I believe that they were about 
right on the point that the time had 
arrived to build a Temple; at least, the 
time is arriving when that Temple 
should be built; but it will not be 
built by that class of people. It will be 
built by the Latter-day Saints in con- 
nection with the Lamanites. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and let us try and be as perfect 
as we possibly can be from day to day. 
No religion has in it such prospects 
as has the religion of the Latter-day 
Saints. Nothing was ever introduced to 
man equal to it in its grand and glori- 
ous advantages. We ought to enjoy 
our religion to such an extent as to be 
happy most all the time. We should 
never allow ourselves to get into a po- 
sition where we cannot secure some 
happiness. The prospects that have 
been opened up to us are grand. In 
the next life we will have our bodies 
glorified and free from sickness and 
death. Nothing is so beautiful as a per- 
son in a resurrected and glorified con- 
dition. There is nothing more lovely 
than to be in this condition and have 
our wives and children and friends with 
us. So long as we are faithful, noth- 
ing can prevent us from getting all 
the enjoyment that can be secured 
through prospects of this kind. Wheth- 
er we are in prison, or whether we are 
in poverty, these prospects are always 
before us, if we live our religion. Now, 
brethren and sisters, be faithful, keep 
the commandments of God, and do not 
forget the teachings that you have had 
during the three days of this confer- 
ence. Amen.

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Coming of Christ is near— Preparation needed for 
the event — The Church lead continuously by 
revelation— Work of warning the nations— 
Benefits oi prosecuting the Ministry withont 
purse or. script— The Gospel should be carried 
to many nations not yet warned. 

In looking at this congregation and 
thinking that I might have to speak to 
it, a great fear has come over me, and 
I feel as though I never was weaker 
in my life or had more dread of speak- 
ing. The spirit of God has been here 
and has rested upon the brethren who 
have spoken, and it seems as if every- 
thing has been said that is necessary to 
enlighten, to strengthen and to build 
up the members of this Church. In 
the remarks that I shall make I trust 
that I shall have the Spirit of God also, 
as well as your faith and prayers, that 
what I say may be dictated by the 
Spirit and be of profit to all of us. In 
my public ministry I have never felt 
satisfied unless I was instructed and 
edified myself in the remarks which I 
made, and generally I have been more 
strengthened and edified by my own re- 
marks than perhaps any member of the 
congregation has. I think this should 
be the case. I believe all speakers, 
when they speak by the Spirit of God, 
are edified by the Spirit of God which 
rests upon them. 

I have had resting upon my mind now 
for some time a feeling to call upon 
the Latter-day Saints and tell them that 
the coming of the Lord is near, even 
at our doors. I have been greatly im- 
pressed with this feeling. I know that 
Jesus is coming, and I feel that, as a 
people and as individuals, we ought to 
prepare for His coming. It ought to 
be our study every day how we can 
best prepare for His coming. While the 
angels themselves do not know when 
He will come, yet they do know, and 
we know also, —for God has revealed 
it to us,— that Jesus will come. He 
will come suddenly, when the world is 
unprepared for Him, and when He will 
be least expected by the inhabitants 
of the earth, and perhaps by us. He 
commands us to be "looking forth 
for the coming of the Son of Man, for 
He cometh in an hour you think not." 
There may be many of us, and I hope 



64 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



there will be, who will be prepared for 
that great and glorious event. 

In view of the certainty of His com- 
ing, I think it is our duty to prepare 
for it by every means in our power. 
The Lord has revealed unto us that 
which He wants us to do, and though 
we do not receive written revelations 
(the men who have held the keys have 
not always felt led to write revelatioas 
as the Prophet Joseph did), the ser- 
vants of the Lord do receive 
revelations, and they are as binding 
upon the people as though they 
were printed and published throughout 
all the Stakes of Zion. The oracles of 
God are here, and He speaks through 
His servant whom He has chosen to 
hold the keys. He gives revelations to 
others also concerning many matters, 
but it is reserved for one man, and one 
man alone at a time, to give revelations 
to the Church. "We have been blessed 
as a people with an abundance of reve- 
lation. Some have deceived them- 
selves with the idea that because rev- 
elations have not been written and pub- 
lished,therefore there has been a lessen- 
ing of power in the Church of Christ. 
This is a very great mistake, as we will 
find out sooner or later. This Church 
has been continually led by the spirit 
of revelation. The spirit of revelation 
has been here in our conference. The 
addresses that have been delivered 
have been made under the inspiration 
of the Holy Ghost, and they are the 
word of God unto this people, binding 
upon them, and they will be judged by 
these words that we have heard. If we 
do not listen to these instructions and 
counsels and abide by the word of God 
as it is given to us from time to time, 
we shall be held to a strict accounta- 
bility. 

If it be true, as I testify it is, that 
the coming of the Lord is not far dis- 
tant, ought we not as a people and as 
individuals to prepare ourselves by lis- 
tening to the instructions that we re- 
ceive, and putting our households and 
all our affairs in such a condition that 
if the Lord should come suddenly upon 
us we should be prepared for His com- 
ing? We should see to it that nothing 
is left undone by us, no commandment 
unfulfilled, no counsel or instruction 
disregarded; but that our lives and the 
lives of our families as far as we can 



control them, are brought into such a 
condition as to be prepared for that 
glorious event; that we shall have oil 
in our lamps, and the lamps be trimmed 
and burning, that when we lay down at 
night, if the Lord should come, as He 
has said he would, like a thief in the 
night, we would not be unprepared for 
His coming. 

Many who are now within the sound 
of my voice have been promised that 
they shall live, if they have faith, to 
behold the second coming of the Lord. 
The Lord has also promised that certain 
events shall take place while men that 
are standing in the generation in which 
these promises were made will yet be 
alive. All these promises go to show 
that it is not wise for us to put off the 
day of preparation and to think, "Oh! 
the Lord delayeth His coming. He may 
come while my children, or my grand- 
children, or some of my posterity are 
living, but he will not come in my day." 

I know there is a great work to be 
done before the coming of the Lord, and 
for one I want to do all in my power 
to perform the part that is allotted to 
me. I desire, my brethren and sisters, 
that when the Lord comes our garments 
?hall be clean and unspotted from the 
blood of this generation; that we shall 
not have left undone anything that God 
has commanded us to do in connection 
with the generation in which we live. 

"We have been laboring as a people 
and as individuals with a good deal of 
zeal and devotion. Elders have gone 
forth and have spent the best years of 
their lives in proclaiming the word of 
the Lord to the people. We have sent 
to foreign lands and have brought those 
who have embraced the Gospel to Zion. 
When I think of the labors of this peo- 
ple in this direction, I am amazed at 
what they have done. How willing the 
Elders have been to go and spend their 
means to save the inhabitants of the 
earth! There is nothing like it in his- 
tory, that I know anything about. In 
this respect we have been indefatigable. 
Nevertheless, there is a great deal to be 
done. I believe many of the Latter-day 
Saints have shown more of a disposition 
to save other people than they have to 
save themselves. This class has been 
more willing to do that which is neces- 
sary to save the souls of the children of 
men than they have been to save their 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



65 



cwn souls. They have been careless 
and indifferent concerning the salvation 
of themselves and their families. Presi- 
dent Young used to say that there were 
many men that were willing to die for 
their religion who would not live it. So 
there are many men willing to make 
great sacrifices for the salvation of 
others who are apparently indifferent 
about that which is necessary for their 
own salvation. This is not right. It 
is a personal matter with us as to 
whether we are preparing ourselves and 
our families for the coming of the Lord. 
Are we doing all that we can to prepare 
ourselves and our households, so that 
when He comes we shall not be caught 
unprepared? 

This talk that we have heard so much 
of concerning tithing is a preparatory 
step. I believe President Snow has been 
moved upon by the power of God to 
stir this people up to diligence upon this 
point. There are other things contin- 
gent upon the payment of tithing. Pres- 
ident Snow has told us this afternoon 
what one thing is, and that we should 
prepare ourselves for it. We are not 
groping as blind men to find the path, 
for the Lord has made the path plain 
before us. We are not in the dark; but 
it is necessary that we should exercise 
faith in God and beseech Him continu- 
ally to give unto us the strength and 
grace necessary to perform the labors 
that have to be done in order to prepare 
ourselves as we should do. 

There is one labor that has rested up- 
on my mind with great weight for some 
time. I have looked at the nations of 
the earth and have examined somewhat 
into the labors of our Elders. We have 
about eighteen hundred Elders preach- 
ing the Gospel in various places, and 
they are doing the work most thorough- 
ly. Men and women have gone forth 
and have spent their time with the great- 
est pleasure, forsaking home, leaving 
business, and devoting themselves for 
years to the warning of the people con- 
cerning the calamities that the Lord is 
about to pour out upon the nations of 
the earth. Both men and women are 
doing this work with all diligence and 
faithfulness. I was told a day or two 
ago concerning a young lady who is out 
in the ministry. Her brother has just 
returned from a mission. In coming 



from his mission he had called upon her 
and they had visited some places to- 
gether. I asked her parents why she 
did not return with her brother. They 
said she did not want to return. She 
has only been out eighteen months, she 
is busily engaged in the work of the 
Lord, and she feels desirous to complete 
her mission before she returns home. 
This spirit is on our sisters, as well as 
on our Elders, and they do all in their 
power to warn the people, until in some 
lands and some cities there is scarcely 
a house that has not been visited or 
that has not had a tract delivered to it. 

According to the last report 
received from Great Britain, 
two hundred and seventy-four Elders 
are laboring in that land, with faithful- 
ness and assiduity, spending time and 
means and in a certain sense wearing 
themselves out in order to deliver the 
message of salvation that God has com- 
mitted to them. This work has now 
been going on for upwards of sixty 
years, and there is scarcely an ear that 
has not heard the message. 

Concerning the missions in this coun- 
try, this land has been warned now for 
seventy years. God commanded the 
Elders in early days to warn the peo- 
ple, and away back in Kirtland and 
Missouri He said that the leading El- 
ders of the Church had done their duty, 
and there was none of the blood of this 
generation on their garments; but 
those who had not labored as they had 
done were to continue in the field until 
it could also be said of them that their 
garments were clean from the blood of 
this generation. In that early day the 
Lord spoke in this manner. On one oc- 
casion He said: "Behold, I sent you 
out to testify and warn the people, and 
it becometh every man who hath been 
warned, to warn his neighbor. 

"Therefore they are left without ex- 
cuse, and their sins are upon their own 
heads." 

The Lord appeared to be determined 
to cut his work short in righteousness. 
I do not wish to detract from the labors 
of the Elders in our own land; but this 
land has been warned. I feel that we 
can stand before the judgment seat of 
our great Creator free from the blood 
of this generation in these United 
States. It is true, we have not told 
every man, woman and child about 



66 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



these things. God requires us to preach 
His Gospel and to warn the inhabitants 
of all lands, and then if they do not 
take warning and warn their neighbors, 
their sins rest upon their own heads, 
and our garments are clean. 

How long has this great work which 
God has established been a theme for 
newspaper writers? Ever since we came 
to these valleys they have known about 
us; they have had thousands of testi- 
monies borne to them concerning this 
work; they have seen it grow and 
spread; they have seen and heard of 
our Elders traveling through their 
cities and visiting foreign lands; and 
now the warning voice of the judgments 
of God is following the testimony of the 
Elders. As far back as December, 1832, 
the Lord said: 

'And after your testimony cometh 
wrath and indignation upon the people; 

"For after your testimony cometh the 
testimony of earthquakes, that shall 
cause groanings in the midst of her, and 
men shall fall upon the ground, and 
shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the 
voice of thunderings, and the voice of 
lightnings, and the voice of tempests, 
and the voice of the waves of the sea, 
heaving themselves beyond their 
bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commo- 
tion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail 
them; for fear shall come upon all peo- 
ple." 

The Lord's judgments are following 
the warning voice that has be.\;n raised 
by the Elders of this Church. If an- 
other Elder did not lift his voice, and 
if another tract were not distributed in 
this land of ours, the Elders have done 
their duty, and this nation cannot in the 
day of judgment rise up against the 
Elders of this Church and say that they 
did not bear testimony to them con- 
cerning this work. I am now telling 
you my own views. Our Elders spend 
two years or more in the missionary 
field and they baptize on an average not 
exceeding four souls, or about two a 
year. I would not dare to tell you how 
much money is spent as well as time to 
do this. 

I will tell you another thing connected 
with this, inasmuch as it occurs to my 
mind. Many of those who are brought 
into the Church under the present sys- 
tem of preaching with purse and with 
scrip, instead of without purse and 



without scrip, have not the faith to 
stand as they would have if they en- 
tertained L he Elders and furnished 
them with what they needed, as God 
has commanded. I do not believe we 
are getting so good a class of converts 
under this system as under the old sys- 
tem which was followed by the early 
Elders of this Church. Our converts 
showed their faith by feeding and 
clothing the Elders and by giving them 
money when necessary. By taking this 
course they proved themselves to be the 
disciples of the Son of God, for the 
Lord says: 

"Whoso receiveth you receiveth me, 
and the same will feed you, and clothe 
you, and give you money. 

"And he who feeds you, or clothes 
you, or gives you money, shall in no 
wise lose his reward: 

"And he that doeth not these things 
is not my disciple; by this you may 
know my disciples." (Doc. and Gov. 84: 
89—91.) 

But now our Elders go and spend 
their own money, and people in some 
cases will not feed and entertain them. 
Of course, I believe there are many 
places where the people, but especially 
the Saints, are exceedingly kind to the 
Elders, and while there may be some 
exceptions, there are very good people 
being gathered out now. 

In this land of ours, what warnings 
there have been! The blood of the mar- 
tyrs shed upon this soil is crying to 
God. The expulsion of the Saints from 
Ohio, the expulsion from Jackson coun- 
ty, from Clay county, from Caldwell 
county, in Missouri, and from Illinois- 
are they not testimonies? I take it that 
they are, and God will hold them as 
testimonies against the guilty men and 
women who have done these things, as 
well as against those who have never 
lifted their hands or their voices to re- 
dress any wrong that has been prac- 
ticed upon the Latter-day Saints. 
Then since we came to these 
mountains, this whole nation has 
been almost convulsed by this Mor- 
mon question. It has agitated the peo- 
ple everywhere. All the newspapers 
in the land have discussed it in all its 
phases. Is not this a warning? What 
more can we do than we have done in 
this direction? Or shall we all go out 
and allow ourselves to be martyred. 
Hundreds of Elders now in the mis-

sionary fields might leave this nation, 
and go to peoples who have never heard 
the sound of the Gospel; I would carry 
the tidings of salvation to lands that 
are now locked in tyranny, where the 
people cannot breathe the air of free- 
dom; and I would risk imprisonment, 
and even death, in order that these 
peoples might be warned. No doubt 
thousands of them are praying to our 
heavenly Father to send them the truth 
of heaven; for there are other souls who 
want the truth besides those who have 
received it. When this Gospel was first 
carried to Europe thousands were pray- 
ing for God to send the truth to them. 
When they heard the message they re- 
ceived it gladly. So in other places 
where the Elders have gone. But there 
are many nations yet to be warned, 
and we have this work to do. I will 
not say that we ought to do it 
before the Lord comes, for I do not 
know when He will come. But this duty 
is incumbent upon us; for by people out 
of every nation under heaven Zion is 
to be built up. Every land and every 
nationality will have to contribute of 
its strength and numbers, in greater or 
less degree, to fulfill the words of God 
concerning the building up of Zion. 
Oriental lands now untouched by the 
Elders of the Church have to be pene- 
trated and the honest souls sought out. 
In this work God will precede His El- 
ders. He will send His angels before 
them, as He has done, to prepare the 
people to receive them and to listen to 
their message. 

My feeling is that we should with- 
draw our efforts to a great extent from 
the countries where we have been 
spending so much time and means with 
so little fruits. Let the Gospel be sent 
to lands afar off, where tyranny reigns; 
and when the Gospel goes there. God 
will soften the hearts of the rulers, and 
greater freedom will follow. It has 
been so in Germany; it will be so in 
Russia, in the Latin countries, and in 
the countries of eastern Europe. God 
is working with the nations, and He 
will work with us if we will do our 
duty. Then we can stand before our 
Father with our skirts clean from the 
blood of this generation, having- done 
our whole duty. 

If it should cost us our liberty, as it 
may do at times; if it should cost us our 



lives, as it may do, to carry this Gospel 
to every land, it would be no more than 
others have suffered in the same cause. 
God has said in this Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants: 

"And whoso layeth down his life in 
my cause, for my name's sake, shall 
find it again, even life eternal: 

"Therefore be not afraid of your ene- 
mies, for I have decreed in my heart, 
saith the Lord, that I will prove you in 
all things, whether you will abide in my 
covenant, even unto death, that you 
may be found worthy." 

And again He says: 

"And all they who suffer persecution 
for my name, and endure in faith, 
though they are called to lay down 
their lives for my sake, yet shall they 
partake of all this glory. 

"Wherefore, fear not even unto death; 
for in this world your joy is not full, but 
in me your joy is full." 

In another revelation the Lord tells 
us: 

"Let no man be afraid to lay down his 
life for my sake, for whoso layeth down 
his life for my sake shall find it again; 

"And whoso is not willing to lay down 
his life for my sake, is not my disciple." 

It is a test by which His disciples may 
be known. But while we should not 
shrink from complying with every re- 
quirement, we ought to avoid persecu- 
tion and death by every means in our 
power that would be honorable and 
consistent with our duties and obliga- 
tions. But in preaching this Gospel to 
the nations of the earth, we ought not 
to be afraid of our liberty or our lives. 
It has cost the liberties of Elders in 
Austria, Norway and other places al- 
ready; but it has been followed by 
greater freedom. The efforts of the 
Elders have been crowned with success 
in this respect. It has seemed as though 
the preaching of the Gospel has had a 
loosening effect in many places upon 
the people. 

In this connection I think we should 
teach our young men all the languages 
of the earth. Let them seek by study, 
by faith, by the gift of tongues and by 
the gift of interpretation to understand 
the languages of men. Our Mutual Im- 
provement associations should devote 
themselves to the study of languages, 
that we may have a people here famil- 
iar with every language spoken under 
heaven. What was the gift of tongues 
given for if not for this? Was it given 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for the brethren and sisters to get up 
and talk in tongues in fast meeting? 
That is a small thing, very good in its 
place; but what we want is to have men 
that can go to any nation and speak 
the language of that nation by the 
power of God, first having sought by 
faith and by study to obtain the lan- 
guage and the gift of interpretation. I 
talk this way because I know that the 
gift of tongues and the gift of interpre- 
tation can be obtained, to enable an 
Elder to speak to the people and to un- 
derstand them when they speak to 
him. We should utilize these gifts that 
God has given for this purpose. Many 
of our Elders who go out into foreign 
lands do acquire the language by that 
gift and are able to speak it with a fa- 
cility that surprises other people. On 
the Sandwich Islands I know that the 
people were astonished by the facility by 
which the language was acquired by our 
Elders and the correctness with which 
it was spoken by them. So it has been 
in Germany. I have had sons there 
who, in a very few weeks were able to 
express their thoughts in the German 
language. Other men have had sons 
there whose efforts have been attended 
with the same results. So it will be if 
we send our Elders to any land — to 
France, to Spain, to Protugal, Italy and 
all along the Mediterranean, to the isles 
of Greece, up to the Danubian princi- 
palities, and into Austria with its nu- 
merous nationalities, to Hungary, Po- 
land, and to Russia. Almost all these 
lands are sealed against us at the pres- 
ent time. We have not made any great 
effort to enter some of them. What 
has been done has been done in a spas- 
modic way. Now I believe with all my 
heart that the time has come for us to 
break forth and lay siege, so to speak, 
to these lands, whereby an entrance 
may be effected and the Gospel be 
preached to the people. If the time has 
come for Elders to go to Japan, let 
Japan be penetrated. After a while 
perhaps an opening may be made in 
Corea, And in Manchuria, and in China, 
and these lands be penetrated by the 
Elders with this message of salvation, 
as soldiers of Christ. Our young men 
go to the Philippines and to Cuba, and 
they have been willing to lay down their 
lives for their country. Young men 
from this State have done so, and have 



thus shown their patriotism. Let us in 
like manner show our patriotism to the 
kingdom of God and for the salvation 
of Jesus Christ, our great leader. Now 
is the time for us to do this, and we 
shall be blessed in doing it. God will 
be with us and will bless us, as He 
has done in every effort that we have 
made to do His will. It is His will that 
this Gospel of the kingdom should be 
preached, that every ear mav hear the 
sound of it; not, perhaps, by direct con- 
tact with every individual, but by the 
signs that accompany the kingdom of 
God and the wonderful events that are 
taking place. 

The Spirit of God is moving upon the 
people in all lands, and in many coun- 
tries they are waiting in solemn antici- 
pation of what is going to happen. All 
the nations of the earth feel that some- 
thing remarkable is likely to happen, 
but they do not know what. The hon- 
est in heart in those lands, when they 
hear the glad tidings that God has pro- 
vided a refuge to which thev can flee 
as He did in the days of Noah, will 
be led co rejoice. God has founded 
this land and the government for the 
express purpose that Zion might 
be built upon this land, and that the 
people of all nations might come here 
singing His praises and thanking Him 
that from the darkness and the threat- 
ening evils by which they are surround- 
ed He has provided a way of escape, a 
safe place, that when calamities and 
judgments come upon the inhabitants 
of the earth, they can stand in holy 
places and be secure by keeping the 
commandments of God. What a glori- 
ous theme this is for the Elders to car- 
ry to the down-trodden of the nations 
of the earth who groan in darkness and 
who see no way of deliverance! Nor 
will it be the down-trodden alone who 
will listen to these tidings. Men in high 
places and of commanding positions 
will yet listen to them, and they will 
take note of this extraordinary people 
who have done such a remarkable work 
and who are now traversing the globe 
to bring from every land all who will 
listen to their message; to bring them 
with all their traditions to this place 
which we call Zion, where they can, by 
the fusing power of the Spirit of God, 
be consolidated into one united people. 
It is already the most wonderful thing 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON.

that has ever taken place upon the 
earth; but if we will do our duty on the 
lines that I have been speaking, how 
much more influence will we have and 
how much more will our God be glori- 
fied! The world will see and wonder at 
what is done by those who are laboring 
in the Lord's name, without taking any 
credit to themselves, but ascribing all 
power and success to Him and His Holy 
Spirit. These will be additional testi- 
monies to the inhabitants of the earth 
that God is in this great movement, 
and that he is preparing the way, as 
the prophets have predicted, for the 
coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. 

Before closing, I wish to say, my 
brethren and sisters, I hope you will 
take these things to heart and prepare 
yourselves. If you are not living as you 
should do, regulate your households and 
strive to live according to the com- 
mandments of God and the counsels of 
His servants. Bring your lives into 
complete subjection to the will of God. 
If there is anything in you or in your 
families that is not in accordance with 
the laws of God, divest yourselves of 
it as fast as you can by faith and 
prayer. Let us be a holy people. Oh! 
when I hear the brethren spending time 
talking about the Word of Wisdom, I 
feel to say, are we still little children 
that we have to be talked to in this way 
meeting after meeting? It is disgrace- 
ful that a people who know as much as 
we do should have to be talked to about 
those little habits concerning which 



God has spoken so plainly. The law of 
tithing ought to be so understood that 
every man, woman and child would 
obey it gladly, for it is accompanied by 
great promises, and it will prepare the 
way for greater things, as President 
Snow has told us. 

I pray God that that which has been 
said during this conference may sink 
deep into all our hearts. I pray God to 
bless you all, to be with you, to fill you 
with the Holy Ghost, to preserve your 
lives, to preserve your generations, that 
you yourselves or some of your pos- 
terity, if you should happen to pass 
away before that time, may be num- 
bered among the Saints of God who 
shall enter into that millennial glory 
which is prepared for the faithful, and 
that none of us may ever be destitute 
of a man or men to stand before the 
Lord, bearing the Holy Priesthood, 
throughout all the generations to come, 
until time shall be no more, which is 
my prayer for you all and for myself, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

The final benediction was pronounced 
by Elder Francis M. Lyman. 

Conference then adjourned for six 
months.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Semi-Annual General Conference. 



The general semi-annual conference 
of the Sunday schools of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
held at the Tabernacle Salt Lake City, 
Sunday evening, Oct. 7, 1900, at 7 
o'clock. General Superintendent Geo. 
Q. Cannon presiding. There were pres- 
ent of the general superintendency, 
Geo. Q. Cannon and Karl G. Maeser; 
most of the members of the Deseret 
Sunday School Union Board, several of 
the Apostles, and a number of Stake 
superintendents, ward officers and Sun- 
day school workers. The conference 
was opened by the Tabernacle choir, 
conducted by Prof. Evan Stephens, 
singing, "For the Strength of the Hills 
We Bless Thee." 

Prayer was offered by Elder John W. 
Taylor. The choir and congregation 
sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day of 
salvation." 

General Secretary Horace S. Ensign 
called the roll, which was responded to 
by thirty-two Stakes and the Iosepa 
colony. 

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT 
GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

We desire whatever may be said this 
evening by those who shall speak to be 
said briefly and to the point. There are 
several subjects that will be 
brought before the meeting, and we 
desire to get through with our business 
so that we can dismiss at the proper 
time. 

It is very gratifying to see such a 
large congregation here this evening. It 
is an evidence of the interest that is 
taken in the great work of training our 
children in the principles that belong 
to our religion and of preparing them 
by proper instruction for the duties of 
life as Latter-day Saints. We have 
every reason to be encouraged. Every 
man and woman that Is engaged in 



this work throughout the Church has 
great cause to be encouraged at the 
results of their labors. The Sunday 
school work is prospering, and, it is 
enlisting, as it should do, the energy, 
the talent and the skill of a great many 
people who labor in this cause, prompt- 
ed entirely by motives of love— love for 
the salvation of their fellows. 

I pray that while we are together this 
evening, we may have the Spirit of God 
resting upon us, and if there are any 
here who have any subject that they 
would like talked about, we would be 
glad to get hints from them, or have 
them come to the stand and mention it, 
so that the subject, if deemed worthy 
of attention, may receive some com- 
ment from the brethren of the Board. I 
ask God to bless us in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. MILLS. 

My brethren and sisters: As Latter- 
day Saints we are all striving to the 
same end. Our duty here upon earth is 
to live in such a way that when we 
have finished our work here, we may 
go back into the presence of God. We 
have various organizations +o help us to 
this end, above all, we have a story to 
tell that no other people can tell; and 
unless we are ready and willing to tell 
that story, we are not doing our duty. 
We should not be of that class of people 
that Rousseau spoke of when he said, 
"Some men live to be a hundred years 
old who die at their birth." We ought 
always to be alive to do our duty; and 
if we do this we shall find that our 
work will be well accomplished and we 
shall reach the end we seek. 

The aim in a Sunday school is to 
make Latter-day Saints. If we are go- 
ing to make Latter-day Saints of the 
children, we certainly ought to be Lat- 
ter-day Saints ourselves. Teachers 
ought to live up to the minor duties. 



72 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



They should not delve into the myster- 
ies. These minor duties form a good 
foundation for our characters; and if 
we work harmoniously in this respect, 
we shall be able to accomplish that 
which we desire. In our Stake confer- 
ences, which are held annually, it is 
necessary that all officers participate 
in that work; that representatives be 
sent from every Sunday school to the 
annual stake conference, in order that 
they may get the instructions that are 
given there, and take them back to the 
various districts from which they come. 
But even in this case, not all of the 
people in the Stake can go to the an- 
nual Stake conferences; and for that 
reason, in some Stakes, particularly in 
the Sanpete Stake, the Weber Stake, 
and the Utah Stake of Zion, there have 
been district conferences appointed, and 
in these district conferences the same 
work, largely, is taken up that is taken 
up in the Stake conferences. In these 
district conferences more people can be 
enlisted. All of the people of the dis- 
trict in which the conference is held, 
can attend, making comparisons and 
witnessing the exercises. The exercises 
to be rendered here are the best to be 
found in all of the schools of the dis- 
trict, and the superintendents, seeing 
these, may introduce many things 
which will improve their own schools. 
And a'lways only the best of the exer- 
cises of all the districts ought to be 
brought before the Saints in the Stake 
conference, and then the Stake officers, 
visiting all the district conferences, are 
enabled to see the work that is done in 
the various parts of their Stakes better 
than they can see it in the Stake annual 
conference; and the members of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union Board 
who visit the district conferences can 
see the work that is done in these vari- 
ous districts. In the central Stakes the 
work done in the district conferences 
has been very effective in rousing peo- 
ple to their duties, and this work would 
be even more effective in the outlying 
Stakes, if district conferences were held 
regularly. The general board would 
therefore urge the holding of such con- 
ferences. We have found in our visits 
to Stake conferences that in some cases 
there is a very poor representation from 
remote sections of the Stake. In 
some cases people have to come 



from fifty to a hundred miles to 
attend Stake conferences; and 
there are usually enough people in 
these remote parts to form good dis- 
trict conferences. Now if we will all 
be energetic in our work in the Stake 
conferences, and in the district confer- 
ences, and in our ward Sunday schools, 
we shall see unparalleled improvement 
in our Sunday school work. If we will 
live up to the minutest duties, there is 
no doubt that we will reach the great 
end in view. But although this is our 
duty; although we are expected to do 
all this work; although we are expect- 
ed to go through this life and perform 
all our duties, still we have our own 
free agency. As officers and teachers 
we can do as we please. We should 
not stand in the road of the progress 
of the children placed under our charge. 
If we can't keep pace with the work of 
God, we should step aside, and let the 
great work go on. If we do wrong we 
shall have to meet the consequences of 
our wrong doing. If we do right we 
shall have our reward. 
/ 

"Know this, that every soul is free, 
To choose his life and what he'll be; 
For this eternal truth is given, 
That God will force no man to heaven. 

He'll call, persuade, direct aright — 
Bless him with wisdom, love and light — 
In nameless ways be good and kind, 
But never force the human wind. 

Freedom and reason make us men; 
Take these away, what are we then? 
Mere animals, and just as well 
The beasts may think of heaven or 
hell." 

Let us, then, brethren and sisters, 
be energetic in the great work the Lord 
has called us to perform through the 
authorities of the Church, and always 
be ready to work. I ask that the Lord 
will bless us in our endeavors, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ASSISTANT SUPT. KARL G. 
MAESER. 

My dear fellow laborers, among the 
many features in the Sunday school 
work, the importance of concert recita- 
tion is, in some of our Sunday schools, 
not sufficiently appreciated, and I have 
been instructed by President Cannon to 
lay this matter before this conference. 

It is desired by the Sunday School 



: DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



Union Board that concert recitation be 
practiced in every Sunday school 
throughout our Union every Sunday, 
for five minutes or so, before the differ- 
ent departments disperse for their reci- 
tations, that all may be together, the 
theological, second intermediate, first 
intermediate and primary, and all have 
the benefit of the training of that par- 
ticular feature. Many of our Sunday 
school superintendents do not appreci- 
ate the importance of this feature. A 
concert recitation has the tendency of 
photographing, so to speak, the subject 
on the minds of the scholars, so that 
they do not forget it. They are carried 
along with it, but it is not desirable 
to make the exercise monotonous by a 
too frequent repetition of the same sub- 
ject. The Sunday School Union Board 
have recommended six subjects, to start 
with: The Lord's Prayer, the Ten Com- 
mandment, the Articles of Faith, the 
words by which the bread and the water 
of the Sacrament are consecrated, the 
Testimony of the Three Witnesses and 
the presentation of the Authorities of 
the Church as published in the Supple- 
ment to the Leaflets. These are six 
subjects giving material for six weeks 
in succession, one subject each Sunday. 
Then they can all be repeated three or 
four times without becoming monoton- 
ous and wearisome to the pupils. In 
regard to the Ten Commandments and 
the Articles of Faith, the Sun- 
day School Board desires that the 
number of each of the Commandments 
and of the Articles of Faith should 
be repeated by the school — the "first" 
commandment, the "second," the 
"third," and so also, the "first" article, 
the "second," and the "third," and so 
on. It would be well if our teachers 
conducting the concert exercises would 
first familiarize themselves with the 
subjects. Do not stand before the class 
and make mistakes. As long as you 
cannot trust yourself, keep your card 
before you; but let the teacher try as 
soon as he can to stand before the class 
without a note, a book, or a card, so 
that he may set an example to the pu- 
pils. That is— what we want them to 
learn and know, we want to first learn 
and to know ourselves. There is this 
further benefit to be derived, a concert 
recitation harmonizes the minds of the 



73 

pupils of the whole school, about in the 
same way as the singing does. It is a 
means of disciplining, harmonizing, and 
subduing the restless heterogenous 
spirits of which a school is composed. 

Objections have been made by many 
of our professional teachers to this 
concert recitation. They think that it 
is too mechanical. Let it be so. If 
we should not teach any religious prin-^ 
ciple to the children until they are cap- 
able of understanding it — if that prin- 
ciple should be adopted, there would be 
a danger of it leading our children 
away from the Lord. "We could not 
teach them to pray. We should not 
have the little child, three or four years 
old, kneeling at its mother's knee, say- 
ing its evening prayer. We do not 
catechise the child; we do not analyze 
the meaning of that prayer. We teach 
the child to repeat it, although it does 
not understand it thoroughly. If we 
should wait until the children under- 
stand all the prayer, we should not 
teach them to pray.nor teach them any- 
thing about God, nor the Ten Com- 
mandments, nor anything of the Di- 
vine nature, until they are four- 
teen or fifteen years old, when 
they would be weaned away and 
have no taste for Divine things. This 
is a wrong principle altogether. Teach 
them from the beginning. I could bear 
my testimony in regard to these mat- 
ters, from my own experience. But 
keep concert recitations up, my fellow 
teachers, from one Sunday to another. 
Commence with those six subjects 
which the Sunday School Union has 
recommended. Perhaps a passage from 
the scriptures may be judiciously in- 
troduced by the superintendent once in 
a while. A passage of scripture, a short 
one, of two or three lines — not more — 
will occasionally answer for a concert 
recitation. Make your school familiar 
with good passages of scripture, with 
the sayings of wise men, of servants 
of God. These are the subjects sug- 
gested for concert recitation, and the 
more you practice these, the more good 
you will find growing out of it. 

A auestion is asked: "Is it preferable 
to repeat the same exercise in concert 
three or four times consecutively, or 
change the subject each Sunday?" If I 
have not been perfectly plain on that 
subject, I repeat what I wanted to say. 



74 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



Change the subject from one Sunday to 
another; otherwise it would be monot- 
onous. One Sunday recite in concert the 
Lord's Prayer, the following Sunday the 
Ten Commandments, the next the Arti- 
cles of Faith, and so on. There are 
subjects for six Sundays for them, and 
then take them over again two or three 
times, in order not to become monoton- 
ous. The children will thus be made 
quite familiar with them. Any superin- 
tendent may introduce other subjects, 
as for instance extracts from the Ser- 
mon on the Mount, verses from 
standard hymns of the Church, etc. 

APOSTLE HEBER J. GRANT. 

I will say that six months azo I 
tried to sing "O, My Father," and 
failed. I am going to try again, and 
if I fail tonight, I will try again each 
six months from now. (Brother Grant 
then sang the hymn, "O, My Father," 
through, with organ accompaniment by 
Prof. Stephens.) 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

I think Brother Grant's perserverance 
in learning to sing is something very 
admirable. I suppose if some of us who 
have met with him in council and heard 
him join with us in singing had been 
asked if it would be possible for him 
ever to be able to do what he has done 
tonight, I think the universal reply 
would have been in the negative. But 
he has persevered, and I think it is as 
good an illustration of the success of 
perserverance as I ever met with or 
heard of in this Church; and I trust he 
will continue, for he takes great en- 
joyment in singing, and he certainly 
has made very wonderful improvement 
considering the difficulties he has had 
to contend with. 

APOSTLE HEBER J. GRANT. 

It is said in the Book of Doctrine & 
Covenants, that the Lord delights in 
the song of the heart, "yea, the song 
of the righteous is a prayer unto me, 
and shall be answered with a blessing 
upon their heads." I love the hymn, 
"O, My Father." I love the hymns, 
"Come, come ye Saints," and "We 
thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet;" 
and if I lack the ability to sing them 
well, I do not lack the abil- 



ity to appreciate and love 
the words, and I am deter- 
mined to learn to pray to the Lord in 
the songs of Zion. My determination 
to learn is such that I have sung some 
of our hymns 115 times in one day. 

I have been appointed tonight to 
speak on Cottage Sunday schools. I 
wish to say to the Latter-day Saints 
that wherever there is opportunity to 
have cottage Sunday schools, and get 
our young people to attend, who are 
not now attending our regular Sunday 
schools, we want them organized. We 
want all the young people to have the 
benefits of attending school. We don't 
want a single, solitary one of our child- 
ren neglected. We understand that 
people who are not of us are estab- 
lishing schools in private homes. It 
is said that the Catholics boast that if 
they can have the children to educate 
until they are thirteen years of age, 
they will defy the world to turn them 
away from Catholicism. If they can 
make this boast, then if we as fathers 
and mothers and teachers in the Sabbath 
schools do our duty, we can defy the 
world to turn our little ones away from 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Even' mis- 
sionary who is sent out into the world 
is instructed by the Apostles that, under 
no circumstances are they to baptize a 
man's wife without the consent of her 
husband, and under no circumstances 
are they to baptize children without the 
consent of the parents. We do not send 
men abroad to steal children from the 
people of the world; but the missionar- 
ies from the world come here, and they 
say, there is no need of getting after 
these old hard headed "Mormons," as 
we can do nothing with them, we will 
have to work with their children. Let 
the Latter-day Saints be alive and look- 
ing after every one of their children, 
and then there will be no danger of 
their being stolen; and one of the best 
ways is to have these cottage Sunday 
schools where there is no opportunity 
for our children to get to the regular 
Sunday schools. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. SUMMERHAYS. 

Last Friday evening there was quite an 
important meeting held in this city. 
At that meeting there were very many 
topics discussed in regard to Sunday 
school work; and. by the way, the 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



75 



meeting was composed of the Deseret 
Sunday School Union board, the sup- 
erintendents of stakes and their as- 
sistants and aids. 

Before the close of the meeting, a 
question came up as to the advisability 
of buying out the Juvenile Instructor, 
that the Sunday School Union board 
might own it. Of course you under- 
stand that George Q. Cannon & Sons 
have sold out their publishing business 
to the Deseret News. Some of the 
brethren at this meeting in question, 
thought the time opportune to buy 
out the Juvenile Instructor, that it 
might be owned by the Union. The 
question was discussed, and we had al- 
ready bought it without asking Presi- 
dent Cannon anything about it. But 
finally he talked to the meeting, and 
he said that he thought, too, that the 
time was ripe for the Sunday School 
Union to own the Juvenile Instructor. 
And upon the motion of one of the 
brethren, a committee was appointed 
to confer with President Cannon, and 
see if terms could be made looking to 
its purchase. This committee desire me 
to say tonight that since that meeting 
on Friday evening, they have been 
working looking to the end that the 
Juvenile Instructor might become the 
property of the Union. We cannot re- 
port in full tonight as to the outcome 
of our labors; but we are quite sure 
that the deal will be consummated, and 
we hope to have all our plans matured 
so that we can report to you at the 
coming convention, and perhaps the 
deal will be consummated then. Presi- 
dent George Q. Cannon has met us 
more than half way as far as we have 
gone, and he has told us he is not a 
hard man to deal with, and I think we 
will be able to consummate this ar- 
rangement. If we do, then I want to say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that we 
want you to support that paper as loy- 
ally in the future as you have in the 
past. We would have you bear in mind 
that the Deseret Sunday School board 
is not the Sunday School Union. If this 
paper is bought and we continue to 
publish it. it will be published by the 
Deseret Sunday School Union, and every 
superintendent and every teacher and 
every boy and every girl conected with 
the Sunday schools of the Church belong 
to that union, and therefore we expect 



your support. Also, while we haven't 
got President Cannon's consent yet, we 
expect he will consent to remain the 
editor of the paper. We will report 
further on this at the coming conven- 
tion. 

The committee on convention also de- 
sire me to report that everything is 
working along harmoniously, and we 
believe that we will have a good time. 
We expect to welcome you just as 
heartily, we expect to feed you just 
as well, we expect to have just as good 
a program, and I want to say to you, if 
you will each come with as much of 
the Spirit of God with you this time as 
you did last — and I am quite sure you 
will — you will enjoy yourselves individ- 
ually and collectively, and the conven- 
tion will be a great success. We feel 
on behalf of the committee to say this 
to you. 

Elder John Robinson sang in his us- 
ual sweet style, "Grant us Thy peace." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Here is a question: "We have but one 
baptizing day in each year in our 
Stake. Thus we nearly always have 
children over eight years old in our 
schools that are not baptized." This I 
think to be a very great mistake. I be- 
lieve in this Stake of Zion there is a 
baptizing day in each month, and all 
the children that reach the age of eight 
years, and all others who desire it, may 
be baptized, without waiting any long- 
er than one month. We think it is all 
wrong that children should be kept for 
nearly a year after they are eight years 
of age before they are permitted to be 
baptized, and we would recommend to 
all the Bishops and to the presidents of 
all the Stakes, to institute the prac- 
tice of baptizing once in each month in 
all the Stakes, and as far as possible in 
all the wards, so that all the children 
may be baptized, when they are eight 
years old, according to the command- 
ment that is given to us in the revela- 
tion. We think that the parents as well 
as the Bishops should take very great 
pains in carrying out the instructions 
that are given us in the revelations re- 
specting the proper teaching of their 
children in the first principles of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and in faith in 
God, and in His Son, so that they may 



76 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



be prepared for baptism when they are 
eight years old. Amen. 

APOSTLE JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

My brethren and sisters, I am re- 
quested to soeak for a moment or two 
upon the question of Sunday school 
concerts, that is, having Sunday even- 
ing concerts under the auspices of the 
Sunday school for the purpose of rais- 
ing funds for defraying expenses of 
various kinds. I would say that it is 
the desire of the First Presidency of 
the Church and of President Cannon, 
who presides over this organization, 
that you do not hold what are called 
sacred concerts upon the Sabbath day 
and make a charge for the same. 

There is a custom in several of the 
Stakes of Zion for members of the brass 
band to get together upon the Sabbath 
day for the purpose of practicing, 
claiming that it is the only time when 
they can get together; but this is not 
approved of by the brethren. We, 
therefore, recommend to you — to the 
musical fraternity — that you do not get 
together and practice brass bands upon 
the Sabbath day. I may say the same 
as to secular songs in the Sunday 
schools. The idea is, brethren and sis- 
ters, that they do not wish you to zet 
up schemes to make merchandise out of 
the people on the Sabbath day, in any 
way, shape or form. 

May the Lord bless us, that we may 
understand our duties in these and all 
other respects, and comply with them. 
In the name of Jesus. Amen. 

APOSTLE FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

It is delightful to meet with so many 
people who are interested in the Sunday 
school cause. I do not know of a better 
cause in connection with the work of 
the Lord, and it embraces, directly or 
indirectly, all the Latter-day Saints. 
There are none so aged, nor hardly any 
£»o young, but they are interested in 
the Sunday school cause. It has be- 
come popular, because everybody favors 
the work, and everybody seems willing 
to do their part. This cause has been 
very materially benefited by the organ 
spoken of here by our brother, the 
Juvenile Instructor, and I don't know 
but what we have come to feel as 
though it was our organ already. It 



has always been the organ of the Sun- 
day schools, and it has always seemed 
to ' me as though it was ours; and 
whatever it lacks of being ours, it will 
come to be fully ours in the future, un- 
der the same management or control, so- 
far as its editorial department is con- 
cerned, as it has been in the past. "We 
are well agreed, I believe, all that have 
heard the subject mooted, that it is very 
desirable that the organ should belong 
to us, that we should own it, if we are 
able to make the terms to suit President 
Cannon, and I have no doubt we can. 
There are 120,000 people who are work- 
ers, teachers or pupils, in this organiza- 
tion; that is, about one-third of all the 
Latter-day Saints are included in this 
great movement. It has its branches 
and departments in every ward and in 
every mission everywhere— except the 
cottages, and now the proposition is to 
take it into the cottages, that is, to the 
homes of the people— some of their 
homes— so that the Sunday school is so 
accommodating that if you cannot go 
to the Sunday school, we'll take the 
Sunday school to you, just as has been 
done with conferences. The general con- 
ferences, stake conferences, ward con- 
ferences, and all other kinds of confer- 
ences among the people are taken 
to the people in order that 
all the people may be benefited. 
And in the Sunday school is em- 
braced all mutual improvement 
work, all the primary classes, all the 
religion class members, everybody is 
included. That is the reason the house 
is full here tonight. It takes every- 
body in. And those that it has not al- 
ready taken in, it is willing to take in 
in the future. We are determined to 
have it so arranged that everybody 
shall be interested: that parents shall 
be interested in their children, by their 
own attendance also, and the benefits 
of the Sunday school cause will be 
found on every hand. We bespeak, as 
we have done in the past, for the Sun- 
day schools the" right of way (if that 
is the proper term), for the Sunday 
morning:, that all Sunday mornings 
shall be devoted to the Sunday school 
cause, and that nothing shall interfere, 
or at least as rarely as can be 
arranged. President Cannon has been 
as jealous for the Sunday School 
Union, and more so, than he ever has 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



77 



for the Juvenile Instructor. He has 
always stood up and guarded the cause, 
and he has been listened to, and the 
Presidency of the Church, the general 
authorities, have always been willing 
that the Sunday schools should have 
the Sunday morning, and then other 
times for conferences, such as are need- 
ed, so that every encouragement is 
given that can be given by the general 
authorities. I believe, too, that the 
Bishops are very attentive as a rule to 
the Sunday schools. We hear of noth- 
ing hardly placed in the way of the 
Sunday school cause at the present 
time. Since the schools have been 
graded and departments established, we 
do not need auite as many teachers as 
we used to, and we find the schools well 
supplied with able men and women. The 
Sunday school is taken care of very 
much by the single sisters in the 
Church. They are very devoted and 
faithful. I do not know of any class 
of people that can possibly be more at- 
tentive and faithful than the young la- 
dies have been throughout the Church. 
And the young men are laboring, and 
the Sunday school cause is popular be- 
cause everybody takes hold of it and 
gives it encouragement. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters. There is no one 
that needs to feel that the work is not 
great enough, good enough and import- 
ant enough for his missionary service; 
and we want, to see the cause advocated 
until every child in Zion that belongs 
to Latter-day Saint parents, and every 
child that is not otherwise occupied by 
other people, in other Sunday schools 
is welcomed as a scholar to our schools. 
And our schools are converting. They 
are converting and they are baptizing, 
not without the consent of the parents 
at all, but they are baptizing and bring- 
ing members into this Church, and they 
have been doing it for twenty-five 
years. When I was in England, I re- 
member, quite a number of people were 
baptized in the Nottingham branch, 
through the Sunday schools; and this 
cause is accomplishing a wonderful 
work in Zion. It is accomplishing a 
wonderful work throughout the world; 
and there is no people, I think I may 
safely say, that has made the start, 



and that are so firmly and fully estab- 
lished in the Sunday school cause as the 
Latter-day Saints. I think there is 
nothing in the world to compare with 
it. We challenge the world to show us 
anything to compare with what 
we have accomplished. May the Lord 
bless and sustain us in the future as He 
has done in the past, that our cause 
may be altogether successful. 

President Smith wants to know if I 
want to say something in regard to sec- 
ular songs in the Sunday school. I have 
never heard of them, brethren; I have 
never heard of them in the Sunday 
school. They do not have them in the 
Sunday school; and I believe I never 
heard of but one sacred concert for the 
benefit of Sunday schools. And that was 
the last one; there will never be another. 
I did hear a sacred concert proposed for 
Sunday evening, in order to raise means 
for the missionaries who were in the 
field abroad. But when it was sug- 
gested that it would be better 
to hold it on another night, 
the brethren and sisters all took to it 
in a moment, and it was well advertised 
and made a very great success, and 
made money; but it was on Monday 
night instead of Sunday night. We can- 
not be too careful to instil into the 
minds of the young people the sacred- 
ness of the Sabbath day, that it should 
be kept holy, and that they may appre- 
ciate the sacrament that the Lord has 
commanded to be administered on the 
Sabbath day; that they may appreciate 
it and enjoy it, and realize the value of 
partaking of it, and keep the Sabbath 
day holy. That is one of the very im- 
portant parts of our Sunday school 
work, and I believe it is accomplishing 
its purpose in that regard. The Lord 
bless you, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

At the meeting to which Brother 
Summerhays referred, a decision was 
reached with regard to the publication 
of the Sunday school leaflets next year. 
It was found by the reports of the

brethren, that the leaflets that we have 
published of late have been so lengthy, 
so important, containing so much mat- 
ter, that most of the schools are a long 
way behind, and are not prepared to 
take up new ones; and consequently it 
was decided that at the end of the 
present year, when the forty numbers 
promised on the Articles of 
Faith are published, we would cease for 
a time to publish any more leaflets. 
But we have on hand a large number 
of those already published, and it was 
suggested that they be bound together 
according to their subjects; that is, 
those on the Life of Christ be bound to- 
gether, those on Old Testament history 
be bound together, those on the Book 
of Mormon be bound together, those on 
the Articles of Faith be bound together, 
so that they can be advantageously 
used in the various departments where 
most suitable to the intellectual ad- 
vancement of the pupils. I would add 
we have numbers still on hand for sale 
of nearly all the leaflets that nave been 
published since the commencement. 

Another subject of which, as treas- 
urer of the Union, I wish to remind 
the brethren, is that of the 
nickel donation. You all know that we 
ask but one nickel once a year for the 
Sunday school cause, and the day the 
collection is taken up, is the last Sun- 
day in this month — the last Sunday of 
each October. What I wish to ask this 
evening is, that treasurers and superin- 
tendents who forward moneys to me 
will please do so promptly. Last year's 
donation I have had dribbling in until 
two or three weeks ago, when I received 
another remittance on last year's ac- 
count. As you are aware, the Sunday 
schools are increasing in numbers, and 
the total number of teachers and pupils 
is also increasing at a rapid rate. This 
means that our expenses are increas- 
ing. Therefore, it is very desirable that 
the funds collected should not be .scat- 
tered all over the country, but be in 
the hands of the treasurer for the 
necessary expenses for which the nickel 
fund is used. Those brethren who do 
not send in all they have collected be- 
fore the Convention— which, I take It, 
will be the greater portion — may bring 
or send it in at the time of our conven- 
tion at the middle of November. 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

I would not like to let this subject 
of the leaflets pass without making 
some remarks upon them. I consider 
the leaflets the finest kind of literature 
for our children. The only objection— 
if it can be called an objection— that I 
have heard mentioned in connection 
with them, is that they are not graded, 
and that they are too long for one Sun- 
day's exercises. But I have been great- 
ly impressed with their value. They 
contain an amount of information in a 
condensed space that must be of ex- 
ceeding value to everyone who is a stu- 
dent. "When speaking of students, I 
may include all who are pupils 
in our Sunday schools up to the mature 
man. I consider them excellent, and 
they should be read, and they should be 
taught to our children. We have con- 
cluded to suspend the further publica- 
tion of them for the time being- in order 
that the schools may catch up, that we 
may not have a mass of literature on 
our hands that is not used and waste 
our means in that way. I think this is 
a subject that ought to receive the at- 
tention of all the superintendents; and 
if there are leaflets on hand in any 
Sunday school they should be used, and 
the classes given the instructions that 
are contained in the leaflets. There is 
a great deal of information to be gained 
from them, and I am sure they will be 
valuable not only to the children of the 
Sunday school but to all who will de- 
vote time to their perusal. 

Now in regard to the "Nickel" fund I 
may say that I have been, from the 
very beginning, opposed to levying any 
serious burden on Sunday schools, and 
it was a long time before my consent 
could be obtained to even making a 
nickel donation, for I hoped that we 
would be able to sustain our Sunday 
schools without anything of that kind. 
Hut the necessity for some funds to do 
work that we thought necessary for 
the schools and for their advancement 
compelled us to take into consideration 
the idea of making a small collection 
such as a nickel once a year, and I do 
hope that all the superintendents will 
appreciate the spirit of the Sunday 
School Union board in this respect, and 
will at least do their part in bringing 
about and in collecting this small

amount at the time that is appointed. 
You may depend upon it that every 
cent is used in the most economical and 
careful manner. 

A question has been presented to us, 
sent up to the stand, of this character: 
"There are children who attend our 
Sunday schools whose parents are op- 
posed to the children being- baptized 
although the children desire to be bap- 
tized. They have refused their con- 
sent to the present time, and the ques- 
tion is asked, What shall be done with 
those children in administering the 
Sacrament? Shall they be deprived of 
the Sacrament because of their non- 
baptism. We have considered this 
question, and President Smith and 
Brother Lyman and myself being now 
on the stand here, have decid- 
ed that children who are desirous to 
be baptized and who are prevented by 
those who have, them in charge, their 
parents or guardians, from complying 
with this ordinance, that they should 
have the sacrament administered to 
them; and this will apply to all cases 
of this kind in our Sunday schools. 
Where the children— mark you, I want 
you to mark this — where the children 
are desirous to obey this law and are 
prevented from doing so, that they shall 
receive the Sacrament or have it ad- 
ministered to them. 

Now I would like to make a few re- 
marks upon another subject that has 
been mentioned here, the "Juvenile In- 
structor." You have heard from Brother 
Summerhays concerning it. When I 
was spoken to the other evening in re- 
lation to this, I expressed myself, after 
I had heard a good many remarks, as 
favorable to the sale to the Sunday 
School Union. I have felt for some time 
that this would probably be a better ar- 
rangement. I have, I may say, looked 
upon the Juvenile Instructor as a 
pet. It is the only publication that 
has existed for the long time in the 
Church that it has, that has not re- 
ceived support outside of its subscrip- 
tion. The means it has required to 
sustain it have come out of my private 
funds. I have published it now for 
thirty-five years. It is the oldest publi- 
cation now existing in the Church ex- 
cepting the Millennial Star and the 
Deseret News It has been a labor of love 
Willi me, because I have felt that it was 



identified with the Sunday school cause; 
and at the commencement of its publi- 
cation I felt (I had just returned 
from long missions I had filled) that 
there was a great field in our State for 
the improvement of our little children 
in the organization of Sunday schools 
among them, and the Juvenile In- 
structor has done its part, no 
doubt, in maintaining this idea and 
contributing to the success of the Sun- 
day schools, and I feel that there is a 
great mission yet for it to perform. I 
am willing, under the circumstances, 
that it should go as the brethren desire. 
It has been remarked, so I have been 
told, that it is a private institution. 
Well, it has been. Fortunately it has 
been so. It could not have lived if it 
had not been sustained by private 
funds. There have been many times 
during the thirty-five years that 
have passed that its publication could 
not have continued without such aid. 
Other magazines have tried and have 
failed because of causes which, if they 
had operated upon it, would have 
caused it to be suspended. I was very 
glad, indeed, to feel the spirit 
that was manifested the other 
evening in relation to this before 
I expressed myself in that meeting 
— expressed my willingness to 
have the publication transferred. I 
thought these few words from me were 
due this assembly this evening. 

Before sitting down, there is another 
subject that I think has been touched 
upon by Brother Lyman and others in 
relation to the Sabbath day, that I wish 
to say a word upon. Brethren and sis- 
ters, we ought, with all our energies, 
with all the powers we have, to en- 
deavor to have our children, and the 
rising generation among us, respect the 
Sabbath day. I was greatly pleased in 
Canada to find how strict they were in 
enforcing the law against violators of 
the Sabbath. I feel that there ought to 
be some ordinance, or some rule or law 
put in force that will stop these public 
and private violations of the Sabbath 
day. Its desecration is shocking to 
the sense of those who believe 
in the sacredness of that day, and 
who believe that God has actually 
commanded us to meet together 
and make our offerings on that 
day, to keep it holy and to avoid, as 



8i 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



much as possible, all kinds of work on 
that holy day. Even cooking and house- 
hold work, all such labor, ought to be 
as much as possible lessened. For many 
years in my own family, it was agreed 
that we would do nothing on the 
Sabbath day that could be avoid- 
ed, and we provided beforehand our 
food, so that we would not be under 
the necessity of breaking the Sabbath in 
cooking it. I believe that is a good rule. 
And we should not allow, if we can 
prevent it. the gangs of young men and 
boys that we see around the street cor- 
ners on the Sabbath evenings. 
Let us, as a united people, as 
united Sunday school workers, use our 
personal influence to check this tenden- 
cy that is so painfully apparent among 
us. We are a religious people, and 
when we contrast Salt Lake City in 
these respects with the manner in 
which the Sabbath is observed in com- 
munities that do not make the profes- 
sions that we do, it brings the blush 
of shame to us to see how much behind 
we are in this respect; and I hope that 
our united influence will be used in the 
right direction, to check these viola- 
tions of the holy day that God has set 
apart for worship and for the rest 
of His people. 

APOSTLE GEORGE TEASDALE. 

There is always a question as to what 
are the best means to raise money, to 
meet the local expenses of our Sab- 
bath schools. Sometimes we have had 
a committee go round to beg, to ask 
for contributions for the Sabbath 
school. Now I have found that the way 
that gave the greatest amount of sat- 
isfaction and did most to develop the 
talent that we have in our Sunday 
schools, was to give an entertainment, 
inviting the parents, and the people 
generally, to attend, and charging so 
much admission, giving them the worth 
of their money in the entertainment 
that was provided. It is not very pleas- 
ant to ask our teachers in the Sunday 
school to go around and beg, to take up 
a subscription or anything of that kind. 
It gives a great deal more satisfaction 
when we h fr.-e one of the best enter- 
tainments that we can get. I am re- 
minded now of the sacramental set that 
was presented to the North ward of 
Nenhi by the Primary association. It 
had upon it: "Presented by the Primary 
Association." The means was raised 
bv entertainments. People were well 
naid that attended those entertain- 
ments, and had an opportunity of de- 
veloping the talent that was in the 
Primary association. I thought of this 
while nve were speaking upon having 
Sunday evening concerts. It had been 
suggested, some one reported, at one 



of our metings, that they have a Sun- 
day school concert and pay so much for 
admittance. There is no occasion for 
anything of the kind. I think our chil- 
dren should be taught that the Sab- 
bath is the day of rest and recuperation 
If we could only understand this we 
would find there was philosophy in do- 
ing as little as we possibly could on 
the Sabbath day. I have heard of con- 
tractors in building railroads and hav. 
ing a great many teams, making them 
work every day, Sunday included, and 
they found that they made a mistake, 
that they could do more by resting on 
the Sabbath day. Every principle of 
the GosDel is a natural principle, and 
it is natural we should rest one day in 
seven. We would live longer, feel hap- 
pier and brighter, if we would only lis- 
ten to the kindly suggestions that we 
call the commandments of our beloved 
Father in heaven. 

ELDER J. W. SUMMERHAYS. 

The committee on convention would 
like to give notice to the Stake surjer- 
intendencics that they would like them 
to report immediately to our general 
scretary in regard to the number of 
delegates they expect to send to our 
coming convention. We would also like 
to say to the superintendents of Sun- 
day schools, that we expect you to 
send two delegates from each school, at 
least. We would like this information 
immediately — within the next two 
weeks. You can imagine what would 
be the result if we provided for two 
delr^ates from each school and you 
sent us four. Our committee on en- 
tertainment would simply be over- 
whelmed, and therefore we would like 
this information right away. The date 
of our convention is the 12th and 13th 
of November. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

There has not been so much traveling 
backward and forward in the galleries 
this evening: as I have sometimes wit- 
nessed, but I think there has been en- 
tirely too much, and it is a very great 
breach of good manners for people to 
come to meetings of this kind and be 
traveling backward and forward and be 
disturbing those who have come to hear 
and enjoy; and I hope that in our fu- 
ture meetings our ushers will take the 
necessary steps to prevent this conduct. 

The choir then sang, "From afar 
gracious Lord Thou didst gather Thy 
flock." 

Benediction by Elder Brigham Young.

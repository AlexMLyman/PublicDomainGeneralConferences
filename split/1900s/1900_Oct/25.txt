Apostle John W. Taylor. 

My brethren and sisters, I am requested to soeak for a moment or two upon the question of Sunday school concerts, that is, having Sunday evening concerts under the auspices of the Sunday school for the purpose of raising funds for defraying expenses of various kinds. I would say that it is the desire of the First Presidency of the Church and of President Cannon, who presides over this organization, that you do not hold what are called sacred concerts upon the Sabbath day and make a charge for the same. 

There is a custom in several of the Stakes of Zion for members of the brass band to get together upon the Sabbath day for the purpose of practicing, claiming that it is the only time when they can get together; but this is not approved of by the brethren. We, therefore, recommend to you — to the musical fraternity — that you do not get together and practice brass bands upon the Sabbath day. I may say the same as to secular songs in the Sunday schools. The idea is, brethren and sisters, that they do not wish you to zet up schemes to make merchandise out of the people on the Sabbath day, in any way, shape or form. 

May the Lord bless us, that we may understand our duties in these and all other respects, and comply with them. In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Elder B. F. Johnson. 

My dear brethren and sisters, it is a pleasure that I did not expect, to have the privilege of standing here to bear my humble testimony to the truth of the words this day spoken in your hearing — the truth of the great fact that God has set His hand to the accomplishment of the great purpose of gathering together all things in one in Christ. I feel to express my gratitude that God has given me the privilege of living in this day of the harvest time of the earth — a period toward which all energies, all desires and hopes have been directed from the earliest times. I know that God lives; I know that Jesus Christ lives; I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the Most High God. It is a pleasure to me to look around upon this vast assembly and say to you that this is my testimony, and that I know that the work in which we are engaged as Latter-day Saints, is the work of God. Amen.

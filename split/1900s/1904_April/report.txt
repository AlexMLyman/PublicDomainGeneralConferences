PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

OPENING ADDEESS. 

Guiding care and mercy of the Almighty — His re- 
quiremen s or the Latter-day Saints — Con- 
dition of the unbelieving — Nature of the Holy 
Priesthood — The government of God means 
freedom — The Saints look forward to and long 
for its tstablishmeiit. 

Feeling very greatly dependent upon 
the mercies of the Lord for the guid- 
ing influence of His Holy Spirit, I am 
delighted this morning to welcome this 
vast congregation of Latter-day Saints 
to the opening meeting of this seventy- 
fourth annual conference of the Church. 

We begin our conference on this beau- 
tiful morning, I firmly believe, under 
the divine approval, blessing and fa- 
vor of Almighty God, who has guided 
the destiny of His people from the or- 
ganization of the Church until the pres- 
ent, and whose overruling power has 
preserved us from the hands of our ene- 
mies and guided us in our footsteps 
and in our journeyings into the tops 
of these mountains. Here, by His 
blessing, we have had a measure of 
peace for lo these many years. We 
have been permitted to grow and in- 
crease in numbers, and, as I believe, in 
faith, intelligence and in a better and 
broader understanding of the principles 
of life and salvation which have been 
restored to the earth in the latter day, 
through the administration of divine 
messengers to man and through the di- 
vine calling, appointment and inspira-

tion of the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
his co-laborers in this work, whom the 
Lord prepared in the beginning and 
fitted, by the power and influence of 
His Spirit upon them, for the ministry 
which they were called to fill and per- 
form in /the Church. 

It has not been by the wisdom of man 
that this people have been directed 
in their course until the present; it 
has been by the wisdom of Him who 
is above man and whose knowledge is 
greater than that of man, and 
whose power is above the power 
of man; for it is unto God, our 
Father, we are indebted for the 
mercies we have enjoyed and for 
the present prosperous condition of the 
people of God throughout this inter- 
mountain region and throughout the 
world. The hand of the Lord may not 
be visible to all. There may be many 
who can not discern the workings of 
God's will in the progress and develop- 
ment of this great latter-day work, 
but there are those who see in every 
hour and in every moment of the ex- 
istence of the Church, from its be- 
ginning until now, the overruling, al- 
mighty hand of Him who sent His Only 
Begotten Son to the world to become a 
sacrifice for the sin of the world, that 
as He was lifted up so He, by reason 
of His righteousness and power and 
the sacrifice which He has made, might 
lift up unto God all the children of 
men who would hearken to His voice, 
receive His message and obey His law. 

My heart swells with gratitude to 
God. my Heavenly Father, for His lov- 
ing kindness and mercy to His people 
and to the people of our nation and, 
indeed, to the people of the whole 
world. I can see the hand-dealing 
of the Lord not only with us, a little 
handful of people in the midst of these 
mountains, but also with the great na- 
tion of which we are a part— I was go- 
ing to say an insignificant part, but I 
will not qualify this remark in that 
way. I think also that I can discern 
the hand of the Lord in His dealings 
with other nations of the earth, and I 
fully believe that He, and not the wis- 
dom of men, is shaping the ends or 



destinies of the nations of the earth for 
the accomplishment of His purposes in 
the latter days. Not only are we the 
people of God 1 but all the inhabitants 
of the world are His children, and all 
men in every land and in every clime 
who will humble themselves before the 
Lord and acknowledge Him are enti- 
tled to a measure of His blessing, favor, 
mercy and protection. The Lord 
will look after them and will overrule 
circumstances for their good, as He has 
overruled, in a greater measure, cir- 
cumstances for the good of His people 
who have made a covenant with Him 
by sacrifice, who have obeyed the voice 
of the Spirit unto them, and have yield- 
ed submission to the laws of the Gospel 
and become members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by 
faith, repentance of sin, and the ordin- 
ances of the Gospel that have been in- 
stituted by which mankind may be in- 
itiated into the family of God and be- 
come His sons and His daughters, heirs 
of God and joint heirs with Jesus 
Christ. 

I desire to express to you, my brethren 
and sisters who are here today, my firm 
and fixed conviction that God, the Eter- 
nal Father, is constantly mindful of 
you. He is mindful of His people 
throughout all this land, and he will 
reward you according to your faithful- 
ness in observing the laws of right- 
eousness and of truth. No man need 
fear in his heart when he is conscious 
of having lived up to the principles of 
truth and righteousness as God has re- 
quired it at his hands, according to his 
best knowledge and understanding. I 
do not suppose that you think or that 
anyone will think that we esteem our- 
selves as perfect, or as different and 
apart from other people of the world. 
We are, indeed, I am sorry to say, al- 
together too much like the rest of the 
world in many respects. We are people 
with like passions, like weaknesses, like 
imperfections — no, doubt, results of hu- 
man nature — as the rest of mankind. 
But the difference lies here: We have 
made a covenant in our hearts with 
God. the Eternal Father, that we will 
forsake sin; that we will eschew the

very appearance of evil, as far as we 
possibly can; that we will overcome 
to the utmost our weakness and prone- 
ik-ss to evil and wrong-doing', that we 
will seek light from all sources of light 
and intelligence; that we will seek 
knowledge that comes from above, and 
hold our ears open to listen to the 
words of truth, to the voice oi under- 
standing, and to the voice of inspiration 
that comes from the Lord, or that may 
come from man, inspiring men to do 
better, to improve, to advance in the 
scale of righteousness and of intelli- 
gence in the world; and that we will 
keep ourselves, as far as it is possible 
for us to do so, clean and pure and 
unspotted from the sins of the world. 
That is the difference. We have cov- 
enanted with God that we will do this, 
and we expect that God will require us 
to keep this covenant that we have 
made with Him, and that we will strive 
with all our might to live consistent 
lives before the Lord and keep His 
laws. 

It is hard, very hard indeed, to make 
the blind see or the deaf hear; and it is 
a truth laid down in the doctrines of 
the Gospel as taught to the ancient 
Nephites upon this continent, that 
there are none so blind as those who will 
not see, .and there are none so deaf 
as those who will not hear. There are 
those who will not see and who will not 
hear, and it is vain to attempt to open 
their eyes, for they will to keep them 
shut. It is vain that we attempt to 
open their ears to hear, for they have 
closed their ears against • the 
everlasting truth and they will not 
hear it. What are we to do under such 
circumstances as these? Are we to 
grieve about it? Shall we slacken our 
effort in the least because these condi- 
tions exist in the world? Shall we turn 
back from the plow to which we have 
put our hand because there are those 
in the world that will not see the 
truth and will not hear the voice of the 
Spirit of God calling them to repent- 
ance and to obey the commandments 
of the Lord? Verily no! He would 
be a weak and vacilating and an un- 
profitable servant who would turn 



away from righteousness because there 
are those who will not repent of their 
sins and turn unto righteousness. 

Our duty is to keep steadily on— on 
and upward in the direction that the 
Lord Almighty has marked out for 
us to pursue. Keep the faith; honor 
the name of God in your hearts; revere 
and love the name of Him whose blood 
was shed for the remission of sins for 
the world; honor and hold in the high- 
est esteem him whom God raised up in 
his childhood to lay the foundations of 
this great latter-day work; honor that 
power and that authority which we call 
the Holy Priesthood, which is after the 
order of the Son of God, and which 
has been conferred upon man by God 
Himself. Honor that Priesthood. 
What is that Priesthood? It is nothing 
more and nothing less than divine au- 
thority committed unto man from God. 
That is the principle that we should 
honor. We hold the keys of that au- 
thority and Priesthood ourselves; it 
has been conferred upon the great 
masses of the Latter-day Saints. It 
has, indeed, I may say, been bestowed 
upon many that were not worthy to 
receive it and who have not magnified 
it and who have brought disgrace upon 
themselves and upon the Priesthood 
which was conferred upon them. The 
Priesthood of the Son of God cannot 
be exercised in any degree of unright- 
eousness; neither will its power, its vir- 
tue and authority abide with him who 
is corrupt, who is treacherous in his 
soul toward God and toward his fellow- 
men. It will not abide in force and 
power with him who does not honor it 
in his life by complying with the re- 
quirements of heaven. 

Some people think it is a dreadful 
sin for a people like the Latter-day 
Saints to claim that they believe with 
all their souls that the world 
would be better if only the laws 
of God could be enforced in 
the world. Some people think 
that if God's authority, if 
God's law, if God's righteousness were 
to be enforced among the children of 
men that it would deprive men of their 
liberties, it would bring them into bond-

age, and that it would debase and de- 
grade them. We do not look at this in 
this way. We believe that God's will 
is to exalt men; that the liberty that 
comes through obedience to the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ is the greatest 
measure of liberty that can come to 
man. There is no liberty that men en- 
joy or pretend to enjoy in the world 
that is not founded in the will and in 
the law of God and that does not have 
truth for its underlying principle and 
foundation. It is error that makes 
bondsmen. It is untruth that degrades 
mankind. It is error and the lack of 
knowledge of God's laws and God's will 
that leaves men in the world on a par 
with the brute 'creation; for they have 
no higher instincts, no higher principle, 
no higher incentive, no higher aspira- 
tion than the brute world if they have 
not some inspiration that comes from a 
higher source than man himself. 

I believe in God's law. I believe that 
it is His right to rule in the world. I 
believe that no man has or should have 
any valid objection in his mind to the 
government of God, and the rule of 
Jesus Christ, in the earth. Let us sup- 
pose, for a moment, that Christ were 
here and that He was bearing rule in 
the world. Who would come under His 
condemnation? Who would be subject 
to His chastening word? Who would 
be in disharmony or unfellowship with 
God? Would the righteous man? Would 
the virtuous man? the pure and virtu- 
ous woman? the pure and the honest in 
heart? the upright? the straightfor- 
ward? those who do the will of heaven? 
Would they be in rebellion to Christ's 
rule if He were to come here to rule? 
No. They would welcome the rule and 
reign of Jesus Christ in the earth. They 
would welcome His law and acknowl- 
edge His sovereignty, they would has- 
ten to rally to His standard and to up- 
hold the purpose and the perfection of 
His laws and of His righteousness. 
Who would then be recreant to the rule 
of Christ? The whoremonger, the 
adulterer, the liar, the sorcerer, he who 
bears false witness against his neigh- 
bor, he who seeks to take advantage of 
his brother and who would 



overcome and destroy him for 
his own worldly gain or profit: 
the murderer, the despiser of that 
which is good, the unbeliever in the 
eternities that lie before us, the atheist, 
perhaps, although I think that he 
would not be so far from Christ as 
some that profess to be teachers of His 
doctrines and advocates of His laws. 
It would be the rebellious, the wicked, 
those who would oppress their neighbors 
and enslave them if they could. Such 
as these would be the people who would 
not welcome the reign of Jesus Christ. 
Are there any who profess to be Latter- 
day Saints in this class, and would fear 
to have Christ reign and rule? 

Now, we do not claim that God rules 
in the sense that the world charge us 
with believing. We do not claim nor 
profess that Jesus reigns in the earth 
as the world charge us with believing. 
We say that we would welcome His 
reign. W e say and we feel in our 
hearts that we would love to have Him 
come and reign and rule among men. 
We say and we believe in our hearts 
that so far as we overcome our weak- 
nesses, our imperfections and our re- 
bellious nature which is against the will 
of the Father, so far as we are able to 
subdue the carnal mind and the wick- 
edness and the weaknesses of human 
nature with which we are beset, so far 
as we are able to rise above the grovel- 
ing condition of fallen man and attain 
a higher plane, of virtue, honor, purity 
and righteousness, that so far, and no 
farther, does Christ, the Son of God, 
reign in our hearts. And we would to 
God that we were in such a condition 
that He would reign supreme over our 
souls, and over all that we possess. 
Who shall gainsay this? Who shall say 
that it is wicked to obey Christ? that it 
is wrong to follow in His footsteps and 
obey his laws? We will not say that, 
and we will not, if we can help it, per- 
mit ourselves to be crowded into the 
corner, by which we will have to con- 
fess that we would rather that hell 
should reign on earth than that heaven 
should reign. We would rather that 
God would reign, that heaven would

smile, that righteousness should pre- 
vail, that truth should cover the earth 
as the waters cover the mighty deep. 
"We would rather that every man and 
every woman on earth were a child of 
God and an heir indeed and a joint heir 
with Jesus Christ. "We prefer that. "We 
are working for that; we pray for it; 
we preach the Gospel for this purpose, 
and we hope, by the blessing of the Al- 
mighty upon our efforts and labors in 
the world, that before this work shall 
have completed its mission and the ob- 
ject of its existence in the world, 
every knee shall bow and every tongue 
confess that Jesus is the Christ, to 
the honor and glory of God and to the 
redemption of the world. "We are going 
to keep right on in that line as long as 
God will give us our liberty and per- 
mit us to live in the flesh; and when 
we shall have finished our mission here 
and go behind the veil, with the Priest- 
hood that has been conferred upon us 
here and its keys, authority and power, 
we will continue to administer for the 
redemption of those that have died 
without a knowledge of the truth, in 
the world of spirits, until every son 
and daughter of God that has lived 
upon the earth shall have had the 
privilege of hearing the sound of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and of embrac- 
ing it, that their prison doors may be 
opened, and that liberty may be pro- 
claimed unto them, the liberty of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, wherewith we 
are made free. 

God bless you. May He pour out His 
Spirit upon His people and help them 
to be wise and prudent in their words 
and in their actions. "We say to you 
keep the laws of God, and you should 
honor and keep the constitutional laws 
of men. That is what we say. 

"We say to you, pay your debts and 
get out of debt. Pay your obligations 
and free yourselves from the bondage 
of obligation, if you can, and as soon 
as you can. "We say to you, protect 
your own faith by Godly lives. "We say 
to you do unto others as you would 
have them do unto you — in righteous- 
ness. "We say to you, keep the faith 
delivered to the Saints in the latter- 



day. "We say to you, honor God in your 
lives; honor and love Christ, the Son 
of God, in your hearts; uphold in honor 
and maintain respect for the name of 
Joseph Smith the Prophet of God who 
was instrumental in laying the founda- 
tion of this great latter-day work. Do 
not turn away at every wind of doc- 
trine or be swayed by the cunning 
and craftiness of men, whereby they 
lie in wait to deceive. Know the 
truth for yourselves. Walk in the 
light as Christ is in the light, and you 
will have fellowship with Him, and 
then the blood of Jesus Christ will 
cleanse you from all sin. God bless 
you to this end is my humble prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir then sang the anthem "The 
Mountain of the Lord's House." 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Preparation for the advent of Christ- His death 
and resurrection— Salvation for the dead. 

I greet this congregation in the name 
of the Lord, and I ask that I may have 
a share of your faith and prayers while 
I shall stand before you. I have en- 
joyed the remarks of our President this 
morning, and I believe his words have 
found an echo in every heart. He has 
portrayed unto us our mission and our 
duties here upon the earth — that which 
we are striving for, namely, to serve 
the Lord, to carry out His purposes, 
and to be instruments in His hands to 
bring about the reign of peace, the reign 
of Christ, here upon the earth. This 
work in which we are engaged, we have 
been told, and we have an assurance 
thereof, is the work which is to prepare 
men for the second coming of Christ. 
We believe that the time is near at 
hand when the prophecies concerning 
His coming will be fulfilled. "We know 
that before His coming there must be 
a people prepared to receive Him. "We 
have tried to prepare ourselves, and 
those amongst whom we labor, for this 
great event, and we cannot do this in 
any other way than the one which our 
President has pointed out to us- 

I am reminded that this is Easter. 
We celebrate today the glorious event, 
of the resurrection of our Savior. About

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



1S70 years ago this great event, which 
confirms our hope of eternal life, took 
place. Our Redeemer was laid in a 
nev grave, and remained there until the 
third day after His crucifixion. He arose 
and took upon Himself His body — the 
same body which had suffered upon the 
cross, and which had been buried; and 
in that body he was seen again amongst 
His followers. What a great event is 
the resurrection of Christ! He con- 
quered death; He demonstrated unto 
us that death should not 'forever reign; 
that though He, Himself and all the 
seed of Adam should be subject to 
death, yet death should not continue to 
have power over them. He overcame 
death. He broke its chains, He took 
up His body again, and fulfilled the 
great mission for which He came here 
upon the earth. What a glorious hope 
is given unto us through this event! I 
suppose the date of this anniversary is 
nearly correct. It was about this time 
*of the year when the resurrection took 
place. With Christmas it is different. 
We have nothing to go by to show us 
that the birth of Christ took 
place in December, but we have sug- 
gestions made that it was early in the 
year, and that it must have been at a 
time when it was warm enough for tha 
herders to be out in the fields taking 
care of their flocks. This event, however, 
which is celebrated today throughout 
the Christian world we know, accord- 
ing to the gospels, took place at the 
time of the Jewish passover. In order 
to have it recur annually on a Sunday, 
the Christian chronologers have made 
it fall on the Sunday after the first full 
moon that comes next after the 21st of 
(March. It gives us pleasure, therefore, 
to know that we are near the right 
time when celebrating this event. 

Many doubt the statements of the 
evangelists and say that the resurrec- 
tion <?^uld not take place. Unbelievers? 
have used aiguments against belief in 
the resurrection of Christ. With us, how- 
ever, there is no doubt concerning it. 

We believe the Bible to be the word of 
God as far as it is translated correctly, 
and in that book we find the testimonies 
of several writers to the fact that Jesus 



was resurrected, and that He was seen 
after He had risen, by the Apostles, by 
acquaintances, and at one time by at* 
many as five hundred at once. This 
was the testimony borne by His disci- 
ples when they went out into the world 
after the ascension of Christ, and they 
were willing to suffer all things for 
that testimony. They did not bear this 
testimony with any view of obtaining 
worldly honors in compensation for 
their labor; on the contrary, they knew- 
that the bearing of this testimony con- 
cerning Christ would lead to their fol- 
lowing Him even unto death; but this 
did not deter them, they did not hold 
back or feel afraid of what the world 
would do, but persisted in bearing tes- 
timony that Christ was risen and that 
they had seen Him. 

Not only did Cbrist rise from tn*. 
dead at that time, but others were seen 
who had risen from their graves- 
righteous men and women who died be-, 
fore Christ, and who had the privilege 
of rising with him. I do not believt* 
that the resurrection then was a gen- 
eral one; I believe it extended to those 
only who, while upon earth, had proved 
themselves willing to do all for the 
kingdom of God, and to whom neither 
property, honor, nor life itself had been 
too dear to keep them from carrying 
out the purposes of God. 

The Latter-day Saints believe in a lit- 
eral resurrection. We do not enter- 
tain the idea, as many in the world do. 
that the resurrection will be a spiritual 
one only. The promise of the Lord is 
that we shall receive our bodies 
again. We look upon death mere- 
ly as a temporary separation of the 
spirit and the body. The body of 
Jesus was laid in the grave, and a 
guard placed before it, but His spirit 
did not slumber there. It was only 
the body that was dead. The spirit 
was still alive, and in the spirit He 
visited the good and righteous in Para- 
dise, and also visited the prison where 
the spirits of men had been awaiting 
His coming for many generations, they 
having been placed there for rejecting 
the Gospel when it was preached unto 
them. We are told in the Scripture 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



that He visited the spirits in prison and 
preached unto them. No doubt they 
received with gladness His message, 
and were liberated from the prison. 
Thus he fulfilled the prophecies which 
had declared that His mission was to 
open prison doors. After this, his 
spirit returned unto His body. The 
body was quickened and immortalized. 
It underwent a process of which we 
have no conception. But it was the 
same body. He visited His Apostles 
after His resurrection. He appeared 
in their midst without their seeing- how 
He came. The grosser elements of the 
body were no doubt eliminated. If 
there had been anything corruptible 
in the body that was laid in the tomb, it 
was not incorporated in the resurrected 
body. Before His crucifixion His body 
was subject to death, and He was kill- 
ed by His enemies; but when He took 
His body again all that belonged to 
mortality had been eliminated. His 
body was an immortal one. Yet when 
He showed Himself to His disciples He 
proved unto them that He was the 
same Jesus; there were the wounds in 
hands and feet, and even in His side — 
a convincing proof unto His disciples 
of His identity, and that His body had 
been resurrected. 

We look forward to a time when 
this great blessing shall come to us 
also. We do not look upon death as the 
end of our individual existence. On the 
contrary, knowing Him to be our pro- 
totype, we have the assurance that 
death is only temporary, and that there 
will come a time after death when we 
shall again receive these same bodies 
which we possess here upon the earth, 
and that the union of spirit and body 
shall never be dissolved. The bodies 
we shall receive will be immortal, and 
the spirit and body reunited will con- 
stitute a living soul. 

While upon this subject I will read a 
few passages from the eighty-eighth 
section of the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants: 

"And there shall be silence in heaven 
for the space of half an hour, and im- 
mediately after shall the curtain of 
heaven be unfolded, as a scroll is un- 
folded after it is rolled up, and the face 
of the Lord shall be unveiled; 



'And the Saints that are upon the 
earth, who are alive, shall be quickened, 
and be caught up to meet him. 

"And they who have slept in their 
graves shall come forth; for their 
graves shall be opened, and they also 
shall be caught up to meet him in the 
midst of the pillar of heaven: 

"They are Christ's the first fruits: 
they who shall descend with Him first, 
and they who are on the earth and in 
their graves, who are first caught up to 
meet Him: and all this by the voice of 
the sounding of the trump of the angel 
of God. 

'And after this another angel shall 
sound, which is the second trump; and 
then cometh the redemption of those 
who are Christ's at His coming; who 
have received their part in that prison 
which is prepared for them, that they 
might receive the Gospel, and be judged 
according to men in the flesh. 

"And again, another trump shall 
sound, which is the third trump; and 
then cometh the spirits of men who are 
to be judged, and are found under con- 
demnation: 

"And these are the rest of the dead, 
and they live not again until the thous- 
and years are ended, neither again, un- 
til the end of the earth. 

"And another trump shall sound, 
which is the fourth trump, saying, 
There are found among those who are 
to remain until that great and last day, 
even the end, who shall remain filthy 
still." 

Here we have, through a revelation 
given in 1832, a prophecy concerning the 
manner of the resurrection. It was giv- 
en by revelation unto the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, and it gives us a good idea 
concerning that great event which will 
take place hereafter. When Christ shall 
come the Saints that are upon the earth 
will be quickened, and caught up unto 
Him. They will not have to be laid in 
the grave and undergo death in the or- 
dinary way, but all the change pertain- 
ing unto death will come unto them, 
even if it be as the apostle said, "in the 
twinkling of an eye." The Lord's pow- 
er will be made manifest — for He holds 
the keys of the resurrection, He knows 
all concerning our physical organiza- 
tion, and He is able to accomplish this 
great wonder of the resurrection. So 
when the time comes the faithful of 
the Saints will be quickened and 
caught up to meet Him and the many 
thousands that are coming with Him.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"They who have slept in their graves 
shall come forth; for their graves shall 
be opened, and they also shall be 
caught up to meet him in the midst of 
the pillar of heaven." Now.these are the 
first fruits of that resurrection, and 
tbey shall descend with Christ. They 
also who are on the earth shall be 
caught up to v meet Him. And all this by 
the voice of the trump of the angel of 
God. 

This, brethren and sisters, is some- 
thing worth working for. We de- 
sire to live so that when this 
event shall come, whether we 
be on the earth or in the grave, that 
this sound may be heard by us — that 
we may come forth and join that hap- 
py throng. The revelation goes on to 
describe those who shall hear the 
trump, but who are of a different class 
to that to which I have referred. There 
will be some that did not hear the gos- 
pel upon the earth, but who received 
their portion in the prison. We have 
generally thought that the doctrine of 
salvation for the dead was not taught 
until 1843, when the Prophet Joseph 
received revelations concerning work 
for the dead; but from the very begin- 
ning the Lord revealed unto him that 
there was v a possibility of salvation be- 
ing obtained by those who had passed 
away without a knowledge of the Gos- 
pel. And so we are told here of the 
next class that shall be resurrected: 

"And after this another angel shall 
sound, which is the second trump; and 
then cometh the redemption of those 
who are Christ's at his coming; who 
have received their part in that prison 
which is prepared for them, that they 
might receive the Gospel, and be 
judged according to men in the flesh. 

"And again, another trump shall 
sound, which is the third trump; and 
then cometh the spirits of men who 
are to be judged, and are found under 
condemnation. 

"And these are the rest of the dead, 
and they live not again until the thou- 
sand years are ended, neither again, 
until the end of the earth. 

And another trump shall sound, 
which is the fourth trump, saying, 
There are found among those who are 
to remain until that great and last day, 
even the end, who Shall remain filthy 
still." 



Perhaps the sons of perdition are the 
last class. All will be resurrected. 
Jesus died for us all. He became the 
Redeemer, He bought us for a price, 
and His death brought the privilege of 
resurrection unto every soul, whether 
he be a sinner or not. All will receive 
a share in the resurrection — not in the 
first resurrection, but they will be res- 
urrected, and will be brought before 
the bar of our Heavenly Father. 

Brethren and sisters, let us so live 
that there will be no danger of our be- 
ing in the latter classes, but that we 
may be among the first fruits of Christ. 
Sunday after Sunday we promise that 
we will take upon us His name. Let 
us not only take upon us His name, 
but show in very deed that we are His. N 
Let us follow the good counsel given 
us this morning, live our holy religion, 
carry out the commandments of God, 
and not fear what man may say con- 
cerning us. We know what we have 
received; we know that this work is 
for the salvation and betterment of 
men, then let us carry out its prin- 
ciples. This is ray advice to you. God 
bless you all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 
Missionary work at home and abrad. 

I have no doubt, my brethren and 
sisters, but that you, with myself, have 
greatly rejoiced in what we have heard 
from Presidents Smith and Lund. With 
those brethren, I join in extending to 
you a hearty greeting to this confer- 
ence. When I think that many of you 
have traveled hundreds, and some of 
you thousands, of miles to visit this 
Conference, I feel in my heart to hope 
you will be amply repaid for your jour- 
ney. I trust we will keep in mind the 
good instructions we have already re- 
ceived, and that we will be more dili- 
gent and determined to serve the Lord 
with all our might, mind and strength. 
Our motto, as I understand it, is "Peace 
on Earth, and Good Will to Men." Some 
of you, my brethren, who are present 
today, are laboring in the nations of thg 
earth, endeavoring to enlighten the 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

minds of those who are in darkness 
and bring them to a knowledge of the 
truth. I have no doubt the feeling in 
your heart all the time is, "Peace on 
earth, good will to men." While we 
claim the right to serve the Lord with 
full purpose of heart, in our own way. 
we have no wish to deprive others from 
doing the same. We hope and expect 
to always have the privilege of serving 
the Lord as we feel is best, and while 
we value this privilege ourselves, we 
extend the same right to everybody on 
the face of the earth. I rejoice this, 
morning, my brethren and sisters, in 
the progress of the work, and the good 
reports we receive from the utmost 
"bounds where our brethren are laboring. 
There is a gratifying growth and in- 
crease everywhere, so far as we can 
learn. It is remarkable the inquiries 
that are now being made in relation to 
the Gospel; and while I rejoice in what 
the missionaries are doing abroad, " I 
sometimes think what a difference in 
experience there is right here on this 
Temple block. Here we have estab- 
lished a bureau of information, and a 
number of brethren and sisters are 
called to act as missionaries on this 
block. Instead of their having to wan- 
der up and down the earth seeking for 
the privilege to distribute tracts or im- 
part information in relation to the Gos- 
pel, hundreds and thousands come to 
them to obtain information; and tens of 
thousands of books and pamphlets in 
relation to the Gospel have been dis- 
tributed by the brethren and sisters 
who are laboring here. What a change 
has come over us! I believe that some 
of you, while traveling abroad, will find 
the fruits of the labor on this block. 
Many visitors, if they do not obey the 
Gospel as a result of the work of the 
missionaries here, at least become more 
friendly to the Latter-day Saints than 
they were before they visited us. 

It is a glorious work, brethren and 
sisters, that we are engaged in; may 
we never tire of it, but always be wil- 
ling and faithful in the discharge of 
every duty that is required of us. I feel 
thankful that the Lord has preserved 
: my life, and permitted me to meet with 



you here on the seventy-fourth anni- 
versary of the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. If anybody on earth has cause 
to be thankful I think I have. The Lords 
has permitted me to live to see almost 
my eighty-third year, and I am deeply 
thankful to Him for His goodness. 
While life shall last I propose to work 
more energetically and faithfully than I 
have done hitherto, if the Lord will help 
me to do it. God bless you all, my 
brethren and sisters, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus, Amen.

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Causes of the unity of the Saints— Necessity for 
continuous faithfulness to God— An admonition 
to the people. 

It is about three years since I stood 
before so large a congregation. Dur- 
ing that time I have been abroad, and 
have always felt that we were greatly 
favored when we could meet from 
one hundred to six hundred peo- 
ple. I greatly desire your sym- 
pathy, your faith and prayers, and 
the blessing of the Spirit of the Lord. 
If the Lord speaks through me, I am 
sure I shall be edified in speaking and 
you will be in listening. I greatly en- 
joyed the measure of the Spirit given to 
our brethren this morning, and the 
word of the Lord that we listened to 
through them. I feel disposed to read 
to you a few words uttered by the 
Savior on the occasion of His first visit 
to the people of Nephi. They are to be 
found in the eleventh chapter of III 
Nephi, in the Book of Mormon: 

"And the Lord commanded him (Ne- 
phi) that he should arise. And he 
arose and stood before them.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"And the Lord said unto him, I 
give unto you power that ye shall bap- 
tize this people when I am again as- 
cended into heaven. 

"And again the Lord called others, 
and said unto them likewise; and he 
gave unto them power to baptize. And 
he said unto them, On this wise shall 
ye baptize; and there shall be no dis- 
putations among you. 

"Verily I say unto you, that whoso 
repenteth of his sins through your 
words, and desireth to be baptized in 
my name, on this wise shall ye bap- 
tize them; behold, ye shall go> down and 
stand in the water, and in my name 
shall ye baptize them. 

"And now behold, these are the 
words which ye shall say, calling them 
by name, saying, 

"Having authority given me of Jesus 
Christ, I baptize you in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost. Amen. 

"And then shall ye immerse them in 
the water, and come forth again out 
of the water. 

"And after this manner shall ye 
baptize in my name, for behold, verily 
I say unto you, that the Father, and 
the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; 
and I am in the Father, and the 
Father in me, and the Father and I 
are one. 

"Ana according as I have commanded 
you thus shall ye baptize. And there 
shall be no ■ disputations among you, 
as there hath hitherto been; neither 
shall there be disputations among you 
concerning the points of my doctrine, 
as there hath hitherto been; 

"For verily, verily I say unto you, 
he that hath the spirit of contention 
is not of me, but is of the devil, who 
is the father of contention, and he stir- 
reth up the hearts of men to contend 
with anger, one with another. 

"Behold, this is not my doctrine, to 
stir up the hearts of men with anger, 
one against another; but this is my 
doctrine, that such things should be 
dene away. 

"Behoid ; verily, verily, I say unto 
you, I will declare unto you my doc- 
trine. 

"And this is my doctrine, and it is 
the doctrine which the Father hath 
given unto me; and I bear record of the 
Father, and the Father beareth record 
of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth 
record of the Father and me, and I 
bear record that the Father com- 
mandeth all men, everywhere, to re- 
pent and believe in me; 

"And whoso believeth in me, and is 
baptized, the same shall be saved; and 
they are they who shall inherit the 
kingdom of God. 

"And whoso believeth not in me, and 
is not baptized, shall be damned. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that 



this is my doctrine, and I bear record 
of it from the Father; and whoso be- 
lieveth in me believeth in the 
Father also, and unto him will 
the Father bear record of me; 
for He will visit him with fire, and with 
the Holy Ghost. 

"And thus will the Father bear rec- 
ord of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear 
record unto him of the Father and me; 
for the Father, and I, and the Holy 
Ghost are one." 

It is a great mystery to the people of 
the world how the Latter-day Saints 
hold so unitedly together as a peo- 
ple, why there is such a fraternal, bind- 
ing feeling existing between them. 
Quite generally they look upon it as 
the result of compulsory power, exer- 
cised by the leaders of the Church. How 
incorrect this idea is! What holds this 
people together so solidly, and what 
makes them willing to labor for the sal- 
vation of the children of men, at the 
sacrifice of their own worldly affairs 
and interest, is answered in the text I 
have just read to you. These words 
were uttered on the occasion of the visit 
of the Savior to the Nephites. The Sa- 
vior's ministry i n the flesh commenced 
when the Father announced: "This is 
my beloved Son, in Whom I am well 
pleased." That was the introduction of 
the Son, by the Father, to the people in 
Judea. That also was the Introduction 
by the Father to the Nephites, in the 
land Bountiful, after the Savior had 
been crucified, resurrected, and had as- 
cended to the Father. With this, as in 
Judea, He introduced the Gospel among 
the Nephites. We find also that, in our 
own day, the Father has deigned to 
speak again, and introduce His Son, 
Jesus, to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The 
Savior, as in Judea, and in the land 
Bountiful, so in our own beloved coun- 
try, started the work of the Lord, 
and taught His doctrines to the Proph- 
et Joseph, to Oliver Cowdery, and to 
others, giving them authority to preach 
the Gospel, to baptize repentant sinnerg 
and to install them as members of His 
Church. Having done this, the Father 
bearing record of the Son and the Son 
bearing record of the Father, He an- 
nounced the sacred truths of the Gospel, 
and declared it is eternal life to know 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



11 



God and Jesus Christ whom He hath 
sent; and that it is necessary to receive 
the Holy Ghost, who is given to all who 
repent of their sins and are baptized for 
the remission of them. This is the 
course that has been taken in the intro- 
duction' of the Gospel, as recorded in 
the Jewish and Nephite scriptures, and 
in the scriptures of the present day. The 
form of baptism, the words to be used, 
the declaration of faith and repentance 
necessary, are the same in all the 
scriptures. All the doctrines laid down 
by the Savior for the salvation of the 
children of men are indispensable; no 
man in this or any generation can ever 
enter into and inherit the kingdom of 
God, except he believes and obeys these 
doctrines. They who receive and con- 
form to these principles, receive the 
Father, and the Son, and the Holy 
Ghost, through their faith, repentance, 
obedience, integrity, and devotion to 1 
the work of God while they live in the 
flesh. The Holy Ghost inspires every 
faithful heart. It is His power that 
brings you here today; it is His in- 
spiration that prompted you to leave 
your homes, to travel hundreds of miles 
to the headquarters of the Church, for 
the purpose of worshiping the Lord 
and listening to the counsels of His ser- 
vants. The Lord has spoken to us to- 
day by the inspiration of His Spirit. Ho 
has been present with us by His Spirit 
Every Latter-day Saint has been moved 
upon by that same Spirit, and record 
has been borne in our hearts that we 
have listened to the word and the will 
of the Lord. That is the power, the 
secret power, that binds our hearts to- 
gether and makes them respond as one, 
no matter where we may be. "We may 
be thousands of miles apart, yet we 
are in unison, because bound together 
and inspired by the one Spirit. It is the 
same Spirit which binds the Father and 
the Son and makes them one. As the 
Father and the Son are one, so are we 
one. This is accomplished through our 
faith, repenting of our sins, cleansing 
our hearts, and living lives of purity 
before Him. We may make a good 
start, but if we fail to continue in our 



good works and in our devotion to the 
Lord, that Spirit will diminish within 
us, and as His influence grows less 
within us, we are inclined to divide one 
against the other and receive the spirit 
of the world. Then it is that every 
man is for himself, following the imag- 
inations of his own heart instead of be- 
ing guided by the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost. I would like us to under- 
stand and realize this. Every Latter- 
day Saint is an important factor 
in this great Latter-day work. 
In a sense, the Lord counts upon 
you, my brother, my sister, mv neigh- 
bor, my friend. He depends upon you, 
He needs you in His work, He needs 
your service, your faith, your attention; 
He needs you to stay at home and He 
needs you to go abroad; He needs you 
to hold official positions, and He needs 
you to labor without official positions; 
He needs your services every day, un- 
der the inspiration of the Holy . Ghost. 
Not that His work depends upon you, 
but only for your salvation, He needs 
our righteous services that we may be 
saved; He needs my services that I 
may be saved and redeemed; He needs 
my devotion and faithfulness every day 
of my life. My life will not be too long, 
neither will yours, and the nearer we 
come to the end, the shorter will appear 
to us the time the Lord has allowed us 
to live on the earth. We may regret 
hereafter that we have not made bet- 
ter use of the years that have been al- 
lowed us, for at most they are not 
many. A hundred years is not a very 
lengthy period, and few of us, if any, 
will live to that age. As we get into 
the sixties, seventies, and eighties, the 
time begins to seem remarkably short 
to us. We may then wish we had work- 
ed harder, had been more faithful, and 
devoted more hours and minutes to the 
service of the Lord. We realize the 
fact — which is as true as that we are 
here today — that every man is reward- 
ed according to the extent and quality 
of his life's work; just as men are re- 
warded by earthly employers accord- 
ing to the diligence, devotion, faithful- 
ness, wisdom and judgment they ex- 
ercise in the labors they perform. The 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord requires of us the choicest efforts 
we can make — intellectual, physical, 
moral and spiritual, all that we can ac- 
complish. He desires that we shall be 
amply rewarded, and the supply of re- 
ward and blessing for the children of 
men is not limited. There is an abun- 
dance for every man, woman and child 
that ever was or ever will be upon the 
earth. After they have received all 
they earn through their faithfulness, 
there will be a boundless store of bless- 
ings left. As eternity continues and can 
never grow less,so the blessings and fa- 
vor of the Lord are not wasted or di- 
minished by the appropriation of them; 
hence we need not fear they will become 
exhausted. Space, matter, truth and 
righteousness are illimitable and the 
blessings and favor of the Lord are also 
limitless. We are confined to the lit- 
tle world we live upon today — a few 
thousand miles around it — and that is 
the limit we can traverse in worldly 
affairs; but it is not the limit of the 
universe. The numberless worlds like 
this, and the inexhaustible materials 
of which they are made, are incompre- 
hensible to our minds. Men are limit- 
less also in number. The few hundred 
millions who dwell upon this earth to- 
day are but as "a drop in the bucket" 
compared with the posterity of our Fa- 
ther who dwells in heaven. One reason 
we are here is that we may have pos- 
terity, that we may multiply and re- 
plenish the earth, and increase in num- 
bers. 'We are here that we may in- 
crease also in righteousness, and in all 
things that are essential to salvation. 
We are here to lay the foundation for 
these purposes, and we have not time to 
waste, we cannot spare one moment; 
every hour needs to be utilized, and 
most precious they will appear to ua 
when we come near to the end. When 
a man who has neglected his duties 
feels that there are only a few years, 
or a few weeks, more time allotted to 
him, how he does want to live; how he 
wishes he had gone to the temple; how 
he wishes he had performed a mission 
abroad, or more missions; how he wish- 
es he had been devoted all his life to 
the work of the Lord. Perhaps he has 



a taste of the joy of having done a lit- 
tle; has worked a few years — forty or 
fifty — but wishes he had done more. He 
hag spent, possibly, too much of his 
time endeavoring to gather means. He 
may not have gathered much, because 
men are not numerous ' who 
gather a great deal of means; 
as a rule, we have but little. 
We may not have been sufficiently 
devoted to the things of God, to the in- 
terests of Zion, to spreading the doc- 
trines of the Lord, and to using an in- 
fluence with our neighbors and friends 
at home and abroad, to bring them to 
repentance and salvation. 

Let me exhort you, my brethren and 
sisters, who are here today in many 
thousands, oh! be determined from this 
time to serve the Lord more diligently 
the rest of your lives. I want to do it 
myself. Let us all serve the Lord bet- 
ter; let us be more faithful and de- 
voted, let us be more consistent and 
wise, let us do our duty faithfully and 
well as Latter-day Saints, as citizens 
of the cities, counties and states of our 
nation. Let us see how much we can do 
that may assist men to be blessed and 
redeemed, that they may be warned and 
brought up out of their 1 fallen state in- 
to a condition of righteousness, with the 
favor and blessing of God upon their 
heads. Let us live so that we may en- 
joy the knowledge,inspiration, and light 
that was so beautifully portrayed to 
the Nephites, as I have read to you. 
The same doctrines and principles have 
been laid just as plainly before us, in 
the restoration of the Gospel to this 
people, as they were to the Nephites 
and to ancient Israel. There has been 
the same carefulness and consideration 
from our heavenly Father and His Son, 
Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and 
the same manifestation of powers, gifts 
and graces unto- this people as was 
extended to Israel in Judea, and unto 
the Nephites. The Lord has been mer- 
ciful and kind unto us in this dispensa- 
tion, and has set His hand for the last 
time; in other words, has planted His 
work for the last time upon this earth, 
and it will remain unto the end. This 
work will yet be tolerated by the peoples 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

of the world. We will remain among 
them; we will he friendly and seek to 
do good to them; we will labor for their 
salvation, as we have ever done, and 
still better as we learn how to work 
more wisely. 

It is delightful to meet with such a 
body of Latter-day Saints. The Spirit 
which comes upon every man who re- 
pents and is baptized for the Remission 
of his sins, is with this people. We en- 
joy it every day, possibly not as much 
as we ought to, but we do possess it 
nevertheless. We have, it in our meet- 
ings, in our wards, in our 
organizations, and in the councils of the 
Priesthood. We are thus inspired of 
the Lord, and made one. We enjoy 
that Sprit until it becomes almost com- 
mon with us. We do not always real- 
ize what a large measure of the Spirit 
of the Lord is in our homes with our 
families, enabling us to live for years 
together without contention. Under its 
influence a man may live a long life- 
time without quarreling with his 
neighbors. Although the Lord has pro- 
vided Church courts to adjust difflcul-- 
ties, and officials to correct iniquity in 
members of the Church, every Latter- 
day Saint should see to it that he en- 
joys a measure of inspiration sufficient 
to take care of himself, to direct and 
control his own life, to bring out all 
the good that is in him, and prevent 
him doing anything that is wrong, or 
that would make trouble with his 
neighbor; always living by the rule of 
right and peace that brings happiness 
to humanity. Everyone of us should 
endeavor to act that way. I should 
walk among the children of men so that 
no exceptions need be taken to my 
course of life. I ought to be so modest, 
reserved, and circumspect in every 
movement of my life, and in my min- 
istry, that no man or woman will feel 
offended at me, otherwise I have need 
to repent and reform. You, my breth- 
ren and sisters, should walk in like 
manner. Let us all so order our lives 
that we may be able to approach our 
heavenly Father. When there is sick- 
ness in our families, or when we are 



called to administer to the sick among 
our neighbors, we should always be 
prepared with influence and power from 
the Lord to bestow blessings, impart 
counsel, or exhort the people, and pos- 
sibly reprove sometimes, helping all in 
the path that leads to eternal life. By 
observance of the laws of the Lord we 
are led in the straight and narrow 
way, and the Holy Spirit alone can keep 
us there. We have power to so live 
that the Spirit of the Lord may dwell 
with us. We cannot be Latter-day 
Saints without the Spirit of the Lord; 
and should not try to live without it. 
Do not try to speak without the Spirit 
of the Lord; do not try to build up 
the kingdom of God without the 
direction of His Spirit. If we 
endeavor to do these things by our own 
wisdom we will be sure to go astray 
and make mistakes. It is the office and 
calling of the Spirit of the Lord to 
dwell with you always; to be in your 
homes with your families; in your 
neighborhoods, and in your business af- 
fairs, on the Sabbath day and through- 
out the week, and every day in the 
year, if you do right. 

The Spirit of the Lord should dwell 
richly in our hearts, for the redeemed 
are the temples of that Spirit. We are 
sent here that the Spirit of God may 
domicile in our hearts. That was a part 
of the design in our coming. Without 
it, joy cannot be obtained, and the ob- 
ject of our being will not be realized. 
By the inspiration of that Spirit, when 
President Smith and his brethren stand 
up here and speak to us, we know that 
the Lord is with them; we feel it in our 
bones, and in every fiber of our being, 
that God is with the President and 
speaks through him. Our hearts are 
touched, and the Spirit of God bears 
record in our souls that he is a man of 
God. He has done the will of the Lord, 
and we recognize the spirit and power 
by which he speaks. That is your priv- 
ilege, my brethren and sisters, as well 
as it is mine. You have recog- 
nized unquestionably that the Spirit of 
God has inspired the words spoken. 
Thus the Lord has spoken, the word of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Lord, the mind of the Lord, and 
the purposes of the Lord have been an- 
nounced through his servants to whom 
we have listened. 

The Lord is with this people. He 
has not forsaken them because the 
Prophet Joseph was slain. He has not 
forsaken this work because the Proph- 
et's successors have passed away. He 
will not forsake this work, though 
those who preside now may die; and 
those who lead Israel today will no 
doubt pass away in due time when their 
work is accomplished. But this work 
will go on and endure; it will increase, 
as it has done; it will spread over the 
borders into the states and territories 
that surronud us, and our neighbors 
will love us and bless us, and will seek 
after us. They will appreciate the peo- 
ple who belong to this Church; for they 
are a good people, as a rule. 
They love righteousness, they are hon- 
est, upright and virtuous; they are 
ready and willing to do what God re- 
quires; they are His servants and 
handmaidens, and are not easily shaken 
in their faith, thank the Lord! Never 
mind what occurs; never mind what 
my weaknesses are, nor what any- 
body's weaknesses are; do> not trouble 
about any mistakes that may be made. 
Remember that the Lord makes no 
mistakes. Men make mistakes, but 
God never does. He knows what is 
right and proper. He knows what 
should be done, and how and when it 
should be done; and He leads His 
Church and people gently along, and 
will' lead them unto salvation. 

This is my testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, after I have been 
away from you three years. Oh! how 
I have rejoiced when I have heard 
and read of the prosperity of Zion, and 
felt the spirit of Zion. With all the 
changes that have been made, I have 
been able to recognize that the Lord is 
here. It makes no difference what 
changes may come, the Lord never 
changes. He is here, and you are His 
sons and daughters. He has inspired 
you, and He would inspire you many 
times' more if you would put your- 
selves in condition to receive more 
of His Spirit. 



I pray the Lord to bless you. It is 
hard for me to talk so loud and to 
such a large congregation, and I shall 
have to cease; I pray the Lord to bless 
Icrael and the leaders of Israel. I pray 
the Lord to stay with us by His Spirit 
and never forsake us; for in Him we 
have strength and power, wisdom and 
judgment, and He will control and 
guide us. He will bless these men who 
are called to stand at the head of 
stakes; He will bless our sisters who 
stand at the head of associations; He 
will pour out His Spirit on them,; He 
will remember the mothers who take 
care of the households, and who train 
their children in the way of life and 
salvation; and He will bless all. the 
families of the Saints. God will be 
with us and sustain us. I thank Him 
for the measure of His Spirit that we 
enjoy today in this splendid T£l)".r- 
nacle. God bless Israel forever, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. .A mm.

Christ a revelation of God to man— Pre-existence 
and immortality of man. 

Very much to my surprise I have been 
called upon to address this splendid con- 
gregation. In my own heart I could 
wish that the task had been assigned to 
another; for I do not believe that any 
man can stand before a congregation 
of this kind without feeling his own 
unworthiness and his own limitations, 
which make him sense the truth that he 
is not sufficient for the task. So I feel 
on this occasion that if I can bring 
my own heart and soul into attune 
with the Infinite, and can receive the 
help that comes from the possession of 
the Spirit of the Lord, then, my breth- 
ren and sisters, something of profit, 
something uplifting in its nature, some- 
thing that tends to strengthen faith 
and to increase knowledge, may be 
brought forth. 

As the brethren who have preceded 
me this day, so I will exalt the Lord

in your presence. When I think of 
man, of his weaknesses and limitations. 
I truly feel the need of turning- to our 
Father and bringing Him forth, to- 
gether with the Lord Jesus Christ and 
the Holy Spirit, as the center of our 
faith and the circumference of our 
hope. This morning the President an"! 
Brother Lund brought forth a beauti- 
ful theme suggested by this day, com- 
monly accepted as the anniversary of 
the Resurrection of the Lord. While it 
is common to deal with a great variety 
of subjects in these general conferences 
— and indeed the necessities of the peo- 
ple require the consideration of a variety 
of subjects — I think it is well and in 
harmony with the whole atmosphere of 
our work, and of this day, to devote 
thought to the Lord Jesus Christ; to 
speak of Him and honor Him in our 
hearts, and be put in remembrance of 
Him and the great atonement He has 
wrought out for the children of men. 
Believing this subject to be worthy of 
our consideration, it has occurred to me 
that I could not do better than to read 
to you some items from His history, as 
told in that beautiful simple manner 
in which it is contained in the Scrip- 
tures. I read to you from' the Gospel 
of Matthew: 

"In the end of the Sabbath, as it be- 
gan to daw n toward the first day of the 
week, came Mary Magdalene and the 
other Mary to see the supulchre (in 
which the Lord had lain). 

"And behold, there was a great earth- 
quake: for the angel of the Lord des- 
cended from heaven, and came and 
rolled back the stone from the door, and 
sat upon it. 

"His countenance was like lightning, 
and his raiment white as snow: 

"And for fear of him the keepers did 
shake, and became as dead men." 

These keepers, you will perhaps re- 
member, were appointed to watch the se- 
pulchre at the suggestion of the Jewish 
Priests, lest the disciples of Jesus 
should come by night and steal away 
the body of the Lord, and then report 
that he had risen from the dead ; for 
they remembered that it had been part 
of .one of his discourses that though he 
should be crucified he would arise from 
the dead on the third day. Recalling 



this, the Sanhedrin inspired the ap- 
pointment of certain men to watch the 
sepulchre, lest his body should be stol- 
en. 

"And the angel answered and said 
unto the women, Pear not ye: for I 
know that ye seek Jesus, which was 
crucified. 

"He is not here: for he is risen, as 
he said. Come, see the place where the 
Lord lay. 

"And go quickly and tell his disciples 
that he is risen from the dead and, be- 
hold, he goeth before you into Galilee; 
there shall ye see him: lo, I have told 
you. 

"And they departed quickly from the 
sepulchre with fear and great joy; and 
did run to bring his disciples word. 

"And as they went to tell his disci- 
ples behold, Jesus met them, saying, 
All hail. And they came and held him 
by the feet, and worshiped him. 

"Then said Jesus unto them, Be not 
afraid: go tell my brethern that they 
go into Galilee, and there shall they see 
me. 

"Now when they were going, behold, 
some of the watch came into the city, 
and shewed unto the chief priests all 
things that were done. 

"And when they were assembled with 
the elders, and had taken counsel, they 
gave large money unto the soldiers, 

"Saying, Say ye, His disciples came 
by night, and stole him away while we 
slept." 

It must have been indeed a large re- 
ward that these hypocrites and liars 
gave to the soldiers, for a Roman sol- 
dier to go to sleep at his post on duty 
was a capital offense. But mark this: 

"And if this come to the governor's 
ears, we will persuade him, and se- 
cure you. 

"So they took the money, and did as 
they were taught: and this saying is 
commonly reported among the Jews un- 
til this day. 

"Then the eleven disciples went away 
into Galilee, into a mountain where 
Jesus had appointed them. 

"And when they saw him, they wor- 
shiped him: but some doubted. 

"And Jesus came and spake unto 
them, saying, All power is given unto 
me in heaven and in earth." 

"Go ye therefore, and teach all na- 
tions, baptizing them in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost. 

"Teaching them to observe all things 
whatsoever I have commanded you: 
and, lo, I am with you alway, even un- 
to, the end of the world. Amen." 

I think that is a beautiful chapter 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



worthy of all acceptation. Every ef- 
fort for effect, all the tricks and cun- 
ning- of so-called skillful writing-, are 
absent, and the truth is stated in that 
form which best becomes her— in sim- 
plicity and modesty. I read this chap- 
ter that we may enter into its spirit, 
and have it recall to our minds the 
great truths relating to this part of the 
life of our Savior and Redeemer. 

I rejoiced this afternoon in the read- 
ing by President Lyman from the 
words of the Third Nephi, wherein the 
advent of the Savior into this western 
world is proclaimed, and where so ex- 
plicitly and plainly the great truths 
and ordinances of salvation are set 
forth. And as he read I recalled the 
fact that audiences in this city have 
been listening recently to criticisms of 
the book in the Book of Mormon known 
as "Third Nephi," and the question has 
been discussed whether or not it is 
entitled to be considered a "fifth gos- 
pel." You know we have the history 
of Messiah's birth, life and ministry 
in four books in the Jewish scriptures, 
and this III Nephi gives an account 
of his ministry on this hemisphere; 
and as I say, the question has been 
discussed as to whether it is to be 
considered a "fifth gospel." By the 
way, partly in objection, it has been 
stated that it contains no new truth; 
that it is unlike the gospels in the 
Jewish Scriptures in this, that w r hile 
Mark adds something to what Matthew 
has said, and Luke adds something to 
what Mark has said, and the gospel 
according to St. John is generally con- 
sidered the supplementary gospel by 
way of pre-eminence, because it adds 
so much that the others have omitted; 
but it is claimed that the Third Book 
of Nephi or the "fifth gospel," adds 
nothing to Christian knowledge con- 
cerning salvation. They are very 
much mistaken. The passage which 
Elder Lyman read here this afternoon 
would put to silence several very great 
controversies throughout Christendom 
if men would but accept that "fifth 
gospel." This remark, however, is 
merely by the way. 

I come back to the anniversary that 



we celebrate on this day — the resurrec- 
tion of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I am glad that there are so 
many millions this day rejoic- 
ing in this one great truth of 
the Christian religion — the fact of the 
resurrection of the dead; the hope of 
immortality, which it teaches to man- 
kind. The various sects of Christendom 
may be in error in relation to many 
things, and in error concerning some 
matters pertaining to this fact of the 
resurrection; but I rejoice that through 
all the apostasy from the true religion 
of Jesus Christ this one part of the 
Gospel remains in % the minds and hearts 
of so many people, and is with them a 
hope and an inspiration to higher and 
to better living. When the Church as 
an organization ceased to exist; when, 
as we may say, that glorious sun set 
behind the horizon of man's vision, it 
did leave, at least, some lights in the 
sky that reflected some portions of the 
truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
The dispensation of the gospel, which 
we call the dispensation of the meridian 
of time, because that dispensation was 
given about midway between the com- 
mencement of the work of the Lord in 
this world by the creation of Adam, and 
the final winding up scene which shall 
complete the salvation of men and the 
redemption of the world — I say that 
that dispensation of the Gospel, oc- 
curring midway between these two 
great events, was glorious in many re- 
spects. It was glorious in this for one 
thing— it brought forth a full and com- 
plete revelation of God through the per- 
son and character of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. For, in addition to the work of 
redemption that He wrought out for 
mankind, Jesus Christ stood forth as 
the revealed Deity, aSt God manifested 
in the flesh, the revelation of God to 
man; so that henceforth all the mists 
that befog philosophy, all the errors of 
science falsely so called, all the mys- 
tery that Paganism had interwover 
with this theme, might stand remove 
from the vision of man, and hencefort 
God should be known not only as to th 
fact of His being, but also as to tht 
kind of being He is. It was the design 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



17 



of the Lord that man henceforth should 
see divinity — God revealed through the 
person and character of Jesus Christ. 
And that truth remains in the earth; it 
is a standard by which we may meas- 
ure the teachings of any who shall 
come proclaiming Deity. Does he meas- 
ure up, and is He identical with Jesus 
of Nazareth, the revelation of God to 
man? If not, then we know that teach- 
er who so fails is in error; for as Jesus 
Christ is in His resurrected immortal 
body of flesh and bone — as Jesus Christ 
is in His mental, moral and spiritual 
nature, so God is. 

Now, that truth came forth in its 
fullness in the dispensation ot the meri- 
dian of time, and also this splendid 
truth which is having such an influence 
in the hearts of men — the resurrection 
of the dead. The great truth that man 
must live, and live eternally; that he is 
and will be, in his resurrected person- 
age, an indestructible being. Running 
parallel with that great truth is this 
other truth, that he must school him- 
self to live in harmony with truth as 
God reveals it. The sooner he learns 
that lesson the sooner will 'he be in the 
way of perpetual and eternal happiness. 
He must conform to law, for it is uni- 
versal and infinite. It is everywhere op- 
erating. Man cannot escape it. Ob- 
servance of the law will bring him hap- 
piness and peace, and he will find him- 
self in harmony with all the infinities 
through obedience to( law. 

These are some of the splendid truths 
of our common Christian heritage, and 
I am very happy that there are so many 
millions who participate with us, in 
part at least, in a knowledge of these 
great things. 

During the remarks of our President 
this morning I was reflecting upon the 
subject of the resurrection of the Sa- 
vior, and of the many congregations 
that would assemble to do Him honor 
this day, and I thought, what is it that 
we have to offer the world that they 
<to not now possess? For, in their mis- 
conception of this latter-day work, men 
ave narrowed it down until they miss 
*he really fundamental truths upon 
which the Church of Christ m these 
last days is based, and fail to grasp 



the genius of this great work, just as it 
has been explained to us by Elder Ly- 
man, that they misconceive the bond 
that unites us, the force that impels us 
to united action and makes us, by way 
of pre-eminence the united people. 
And this thought came to my mind in 
connection with the resurrection, name- 
ly, that we have such a fullness of the 
truth, that we believe not only in the 
immortality of man after his resurrec- 
tion, but we believe in the absolute im- 
mortality of the intelligence that is 
within him. That is to say, we be- 
lieve in an immortality that has no be- 
ginning, just as we believe in an im- 
mortality that has no end. Any thing 
short of this is not immortality. John 
begins his Gospel with a very beauti- 
ful preface, which I will read to you. 
I think, by the way, that he wrote it 
because when he composed his gospel 
pagan ideas had begun to creep into the 
Church. The philosophy of Plato, 
which was the rage in that day. had 
taken possession of the minds of the 
people. Plato, by the way, ry\d seized 
upon some great truths, and among oth- 
ers he had grasped, at least in part, 
the meaning of man's immortality, the 
pre-existence and the indestructibility 
of man's spirit. So I think, with this 
in mind, and in order to state the truth 
exactly to the followers of Jesus, John 
started this beautiful preface of his 
Gospel by saying: 

"In the beginning was the Word, and 
the Word was with God, and the Wor ' 
was God. 

"The same was in the beginning with 
God. 

"All things were made by Him; and 
without Him was not any thing made 
that was made. 

"In Him was life; and the life was 
the light of men." 

Later on he said: 

"And the Word was made flesh, and 
dwelt among us, (and we beheld His 
glory, the glory as of the only begot- 
ten of the Father) full of grace and 
truth." 

This last verse identifies Jesus Christ 
with "the Word." "The Word" that 
was with God, that was God, arid that 
was. made flesh, was the Lord Jesus 
Christ. This statement of John's in the 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



preface of his gospel, has reference of 
course to the pre-existent spirit of Jesus 
and to the estate in which He lived, 
moved, and had a tangible being with 
the Father; and so like the Father's 
spirit that we may say He was of the 
same substance with the Father. In 
the Christian world, belief in the eter- 
nity of the Lord Jesus Christ is a doc- 
trine quite generally accepted. But 
"Mormonism" has a word to speak in 
this connection for all the children of 
men. For while the pre-existence of 
the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ is 
a great truth, there is a still greater 
truth to proclaim, and that greater 
truth is part of the message that "Mor- 
monism" has to deliver to the world. 

In a revelation given in 1833 to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord Jesus 
says: 

"And now, verily I say unto you, I 
was in the beginning with the Father, 
and am the first-born;" 

Now mark you: 

"Ye" [meaning the Elders whom He 
addressed] — "ye were also in the 
beginning with the Father; that which 
is spirit, even the spirit of truth," . . . 

"Man was al?o in the beginning with 
God. Intelligence, or the light of 
truth, was not created or made, neither 
indeed can be. 

"All truth is independent in that 
pphere in which God has placed it, to 
act for itself, as all intelligence also, 
otherwise there is no existence. 

"Behold, here is the agency of man, 
and here is the condemnation of man, 
because that which was from the be- 
ginning is plainly manifest unto them, 
and they receive not the light. 

"And every man whose spirit receiv- 
eth not the light is under condemna- 
tion. 

"For man is spirit. " 

Man is not so much lime, phosphate, 
and other gross materials, but man is 
spirit; and was, like Jesus, in the be- 
ginning with the Father. Intelligences 
are begotten spirits, and they partake 
of the nature of him who begets them. 
Paul pays: "We have had Fathers of 
cur flesh which corrected us and we 
gave them reverence: shall we not 
much rather be in subjection to the 
Father of spirits and lfve?" There is 
this difference, I think, between a 



created thing and a begotten person- 
age: A created thing may not partake 
of the nature of him who creates it; 
as for instance, the vessel, constructed 
and put forth into the sea under the 
cunning hands of the shipwright, does 
not partake of the nature of its crea- 
tor; but if the shipwright shall beget 
a son, he imparts to him of his own 
nature, and the offspring in a general 
way is like him who begets it. So when 
we speak of God creating man we 
ought to make this distinction. God 
begets intelligences, spirits, and these 
s'pirits, male and female, partake of the 
nature of God. Intelligence itself is 
uncreated, self-existent; and these 
spirits begotten in the world where 
God dwells are afterwards begotten 
men and women here in the flesh, to 
follow still further in the footsteps of 
their Father. 

This is the great truth which I re- 
ferred to a moment since that Mor- 
monism has to offer to the world. It is 
a principle that was unknown tO' men 
in our generation until it was revealed 
through God's chosen servant in these 
last days, the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
We carry this message in our right 
hand to the world. We not only tell 
men of the immortality that shall be 
after the resurrection, but we tell them 
of the immortality that existed before 
their earth-life began. The mists that 
shroud the origin of man and that per- 
plex the philosophers are pushed away, 
and behold! we look into a beginning- 
less past, as we look forward into an 
endless future. Beginnings can only be 
of a local nature, and this beginning 
spoken of here when Jesus was "in the 
beginning with the Father," and when 
your spirits and mine were "in the be- 
ginning with the Father," has refer- 
ence only to things pertaining to this 
mortal life of ours, and this earth upon 
which we live, and does not refer to 
duration apart from these local events 
about which we talk; and concerning 
which, in order to be understood, we 
have to speak of in terms that are 
sometimes in themselves paradoxical. 
As Brother Lyman taught us this after- 
noon, duration itself is beginningless 
and endless, just as matter is exhaust- 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



less, and cannot be created and can- 
not be annihilated. It can only be 
changed in form to meet the purposes 
of God as He designs the development 
and growth of His universe. 

We take then this truth to the world, 
the truth of the eternal existence of 
man's intelligence. And what will be 
the moral effect of the announcement 
of such a doctrine? A spiritual awak- 
ening. We had not known, neither had 
our fathers known, until it pleased God 
to reveal it, whence man's origin; but 
now we begin to recognize man's im- 
portance in the world. We begin to 
realize that his intelligence, the spirit, 
exists upon tne self same principle upon 
which God exists. We speak of God as 
a self-existent being", and the doctrine is 
true. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught 
that man also was a self-existent being, 
of the same nature as his Father. I 
say the moral effect of that truth in 
the world will yet beget a spiritual up- 
lifting the like of which has not been 
known in the ages that are past. 

I was pleased to hear the hopeful 
notes in the words of our Brother Ly- 
man, whom we are as glad to see among 
us as he is to see us, and it is with 
warm hearts and welcome hands that 
we hail his return. After being faithful, 
sturdy, and true as he has been 
while abroad, he now returns 
to us, and we bid him a hearty 
welcome in this general conference. 
Let me be your mouthpiece in saying 
to him, Welcome, Brother Lyman! I 
say I am pleased to see the hopeful note 
in his words concerning the acceptance 
of this people and their doctrines by 
the world. Many tens of thousands will 
yet receive these truths, perhaps not di- 
rectly from your hands nor from mine; 
but already, as leaven in measures of 
meal are these principles working, and 
light is bursting upon the intelligence 
of the children of men, and they will 
yet lay hold of these great fundamental 
truths of ours; either directly or indi- 
rectly, and so shall this work push its 
way among the nations of the earth, 
until our Father's children (for all the 
inhabitants of the earth are His chil- 
dren as well as we are) shall lay hold 



19 

of these truths, and ultimately be 
brought to an acceptance of a fulness of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I love Mormonism. I love it because 
it is true — because it is the fullness of 
truth. And then I rejoice in its big- 
ness, in its grandeur. I love its spirit 
of liberality, as manifested here in the 
words of the brethren at this confer- 
ence. I love it because its roots run 
down deep into the great things of 
God, and it is as a tree well planted, 
that the winds which beat upon it shall 
only help by driving its roots deeper 
into the soil, spreading further to right 
and left, establishing itself as a tree 
of God's planting, under whose friendly 
branches there is room for all who will 
come unto it; and whose very leaves 
are sufficient for the healing of the na- 
tions. 

Mormonism has a word of hope for 
scattered Israel; it has a word of hope 
for the poor, wandering Lamanite, the 
fallen son of noble sires, the degenerate 
remnant of a once magificent people. 
The Gentiles, in their pride, look upon 
him and despise him. They see his foot- 
steps hastening towards what they re- 
gard as utter extinction. But we arrest 
their sneers by proclaiming the word of 
God that there is hope even for this ap- 
parently helpless race, and Laman shall 
yet be remembered by the Lord; He is 
under covenant to do it. The fathers 
of old prayed in behalf of their poster- 
ity, and God heard and promised, and 
the children shall yet be blessed. 

We have a word of hope also for Ju- 
dah, the outcast, the one people against 
whom every man's hand has been rais- 
ed, and who have been persecuted in 
ages past and now by those who pre- 
tend to be followers of Jesus Christ, 
who Himself was of this same Jewish 
race. Does it not seem strange that 
those who have taken upon them the 
name of Christ should be the most bit- 
ter persecutors of His race! But we 
have a word of hope for Judah. We 
are authorized of God to say to our 
Jewish brethren, that Jerusalem shall 
be redeemed; that your people shall yet 
plant their feet in the land of promise; 
that God will guard your state, and

at the last, in a splendid display of 
power and glory, will redeem you frOm 
the nations that now oppress you. 

"We have a word of warning - to the 
Gentile races upon this promised land 
of the western world. Honor the God 
of this land, says our Book of Mormon. 
If ye honor Him not, but steel your 
hearts against Him, however great our 
love may be for you, the warning 
word of God is, that if you honor not 
the God of this land, who is Jesus 
Christ, you may read your fate in the 
calamities that have overtaken the for- 
mer nations, who in pride and world- 
ly glory once occupied this land from 
north to south as you do. But we will 
not be doubtful of you, but hopeful, 
that you will honor the God of the 
land — Jesus Christ. We will proclaim 
peace, and the peaceable things of 
God's kingdom. We invite and exhort 
all men to accept these principles of di- 
vine truth, so burdened with knowledge 
and with hope-giving life, and so pre- 
cious in ministering unto man's honor 
and glory. The Lord bless you in the

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow meeting was held in the 
Assembly Hall. Sunday, April 3, at 2 
p.m. Elder Hyrum M. Smith of the 
quorum of the Twelve, presided. The 
Temple choir and congregation joined in 
singing, "Now let us rejoice in the day 
of salvation." Prayer was offered by 
Elder Joseph Christenson. The choir 
then sang, "Hosanna to the King." 

ELDER NEPHI L. PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mision.) 

I arise to speak to this congregation 
in fear and trembling. I hope, while we 
are together this afternoon, that we 
will be blessed with the Holy Spirit in 
great abundance, that we may be com- 
forted, and have our faith strengthened, 
and be instructed as the Lord would 



have us, that when we leave this meet- 
ing, at its conclusion, we may feel we 
have been fed with the bread of life. 

I do not know of a time when, in the 
beginning of a conference, I have felt 
happier or more satisfied in my soul 
than this morning, in listening to the 
inspired discourses of the brethren. 
My heart was made to rejoice exceed- 
ingly. I felt that to be with the Lord, 
to feel His power resting upon us, even 
for one or two hours, as it did in the 
meeting in the tabernacle this morning, 
was better than a life-time spent in 
gratifying ambition, or having the 
pleasures that the world can give. 

I could not help thinking of the situa- 
tion of the wicked, those in the world 
who are without the light and know- 
ledge of the truth. I thought also of 
the authority and power that rests upon 
the servants of God, by which this peo- 
ple are led and instructed from time 
to time. My heart glorifies God that 
we are so blessed, in the midst of a 
world of people filled with unbelief, and 
I wondered why we have been selected 
out of all the world, and that there are 
so few of us, fortunate ones chosen to 
perform the particular work of the 
Lord in the earth. When President 
Lund was speaking this morning, he di- 
rected our minds to tne glorious future 
in which we hope to obtain life ever- 
lasting. I thought, as I looked over the 
congregation and saw the white-headed 
men that are among us, how youth is 
slipping away from me, and from thou- 
sands who, a few yeas ago, had brown 
or black hair, bright eyes and straight 
bodies. I looked upon these people to- 
day and thought of how mankind, in 
our present state, in a world of sorrow, 
sin and death, is subjected to the or- 
deal of gradually losing brightness of 
eye, straightness of form, elasticity of 
step, the dignified carriage of youth or 
middle age, and becomes old and de- 
crepit; and I thought, where is there 
an individual among men, in any na- 
tion or country, who would not give the 
crown of a king, if it were his to give, 
to possess the eternal life and power 
that was described in this morning's 
discourse, by our brother who spoke up- 



ELDER NEPHI L. PRATT.

on the resurrection of the dead, to have 
the vigor and power to eternally live 
and be all that a man is in this world 
when he is at his best. That would 
surely be a boon to be sougrit for. If 
there were a fountain anywhere in this 
world from which men could drink and 
have restored to them the faculties of 
youth, or of middle age, and nave eter- 
nal life, kings would give up their 
thrones for such a boon; the rich would 
cast their riches down as nothing, and 
give all in exchange for life everlasting, 
even on a world like this. Millions of 
people would drag themselves across a 
continent, on their hands and knees, to 
drink at such a fountain. All mankind 
would seek it with diligence; it would 
be the one aim of their lives, as they 
increased in years, to get to where they 
might drink at the fountain of eternal 
life. "Mormonism" tells us about the 
fountain of eternal life. "Mormonism," 
if lived here, will improve the powers 
we have on this earth, and will give us 
a life that is many fold better, a life 
of eternal companionship with those 
with whom we have joyfully associated 
in this world. Think of Joseph Smith 
the Prophet being resurrected 
from the grave, and President 
Young, and Heber C. Kimball, 
and other mighty men we have 
become acquainted with. "Where could 
we find greater or better associations 
than with these Saints? Where could 
we obtain better companionship in this 
life than that which God has given us 
in our association with the Saints? 
God has given to us vitality and power 
in our organized capacity, that is the 
wonder and admiration of the world; 
our destiny will be envied by intelligent 
people. 

In the Northwestern States mission, 
our meetinghouses are being filled, 
where, a short time ago, all the adver- 
tising we could do would not bring 
together "a baker's dozen." In o lr 
street meetings we almost block up the 
traffic sometimes in some of the larg- 
er cities. The work of God is growing, 
out there where we are. Thousands of 
people hear the Gospel now who pre- 



viously did not pay any attention to it. 
There seems to be a spirit resting upon 
the people that causes anxiety in some, 
and in others curiosity, to hear us. 
They hear the Gospel preached and feel 
the spirit of inspiration, and many, like 
sheep when they lick salt, want to come 
again, and the work is growing. The 
newspaper men, formerly, would not 
print or publish anything about us that 
we furnished them, but would go to our 
enemies, like those who went to the 
enemies of Jesus Christ in ancient 
times, and obtain garbled stories about 
us; now they come to us for informa- 
tion. They seem now to prefer to get 
information direct from us about 
"Mormonism" and the Gospel; and, 
strange as it may appear, they publish 
the truth about us, and publish inter- 
views as they are given, not distorting 
and changing the facts as they used 
to do. It is no sign we are apostatizing, 
because they speak well of us; we know 
we are not because we enjoy the Spirit, 
and aie being fought hard by the min- 
isters. Whenever we have a good de- 
gree of success we always have a river 
of slander coming, like a stream of 
filth, from the mouths of sectarian min- 
isters and preachers. Well, we don't 
care; it does not hurt us. 

Brethren and sisters, we feel like go- 
ing on in the work of God; my whole 
heart is in it. If we left it where co i Id 
we go? We will stay with it, God being 
our helper, and be faithful to it, and 
do good to our fellow-men, no matter 
what they do to us. We will carry the 
Gospel to the various nations of the 
earth, and build up Zion at home. If 
we do this, and live righteous lives, the 
Lord will never forsake us. The day 
will come when the angel of God will 
sound his trump, when our bodies will 
be released from decrepitude, when old 
age will be thrown aside like a garment, 
and eternal life, eternal felicity, and 
eternal association with the Lord and 
with our loved ones will be o irs. That 
we mav have the blessings of God to be 
and abide with us forever is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ELDER ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF, 
(President of Northern States mission.) 

My brethren and sisters^ I sincerely 
trust that I may enjoy your prayers of 
faith to assist me during the few mo- 
ments that I shall address you upon 
this occasion. 

I appreciate, to the fullest extent, this 
privilege accorded us of coming up to 
Zion occasionally, and looking into the 
faces of the servants of God and listen- 
ing to their voices, because they speak 
unto us the words of eternal life. 

Like the brother who preceded me, 
my soul was made to rejoice in listen- 
ing to the words uttered by the in- 
spired servants of God in our meeting 
this morning, in the Tabernacle. I felt 
to saj- in my heart, "We thank Thee, 
O God, for a Prophet, to guide us in 
these latter days," to point out that 
road which will lead us to the perfec- 
tion that our Father in heaven has ad- 
monished us, through His Son, to strive 
for. I realize, and have a testimony to 
bear, that by following the teachings 
given to us, by the mouthpiece of God 
on the earth, we will be able to reach 
that condition. It is not possible for us, 
by following man's wisdom, to attain 
that condition. Man does not know the 
perfection of God; all the things neces- 
sary for us to do to reach that condi- 
tion have not yet been revealed to us. 
Jesus Christ so informed His Disciples, 
when He labored among them. The 
people of the world have made 
a mistake in supposing that all 
God ever intends to do or say, for the 
advancement and welfare of His chil- 
dren, has been said and is recorded in 
the Bible. But Jesus did not leave this 
impression, as we will find by study- 
ing the Gospel and the sayings of the 
Savior. It was not possible for His 
disciples to absorb and comprehend 
all things He desired to teach them, 
and so he said to them upon one occa- 
sion: "I have yet many things to say 
unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, 
is come, he will guide you into all 
truth; for he shall not speak of him- 



self; but whatsoever he shall hear, that 
shall he speak: and he will shew you 
things to come." 

We are a blessed people in that we 
have realized the promise made to the 
children of men, that those who do the 
will of the Father shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, which is a 
guide to our feet and a light to our 
path. We are a blesed people in that 
we have at our head today those who 
are clothed upon with the Spirit of the 
Lord, and who speak not as the 
scribes but as those having authority. 
I thank God, my brethren and sisters, 
that I live in a day and time when 
we have a prophet to guide us. 

Unfortunately, the people of the world 
persist in misunderstanding the Lat- 
ter-day Saints; they persist in misun- 
derstanding "Mormonism" and what it 
intends to do for the world of mankind. 
In their blindness, they have attempted 
in times past, and are attempting at 
the present time, to bring all the pow- 
ers of the adversary to overthrow and 
frustrate the work of God, which He 
has established upon the earth in these 
the last days. I presume that, among 
the enemies of this work, there are 
those who fancy there is trembling of 
knees and failing of spirit on the part 
of those who have espoused this cause. 
They vainly imagine that the experi- 
ences we have been passing through, and 
the persecution which has and is still 
being hurled against us, will result in 
the overthrow of this work. If we 
were not assured in our hearts that 
we are engaged in the work of God, 
a work which has as its object the 
blessing of mankind, not an individual 
work; that we are not pursuing our 
own selfish desires, that our position 
in the world is not our own choosing, 
independent of a higher power — if we 
did not know for a surety that we are 
a people chosen from the world for a 
special purpose, that God has chosen us, 
as He did people in days that are past, 
to be special instruments in carrying 
out His purposes upon earth, there 
might be some reason for the feeling 
to which I referred. There is no doubt 
in the minds of the Latter-day Saints 



ELDER ASAHEL 

as to the final outcome of this work. 
They have received testimony upon tes- 
timony to the effect that God is at the 
helm; they know that the efforts of 
those who understand us not will be 
in vain, as in times past. It is the 
consciousness of the rectitude of our 
intentions that buoys us up under all 
these things, and in the face of all the 
trials and persecutions that, as a people, 
we are now and have been in times 
gone by called upon to pass through. 

As Latter-day Saints, we take a pe- 
culiar view of life. We look upon our 
present existence as a season of trial, 
a probation, in which we are gaining 
experience', and learning those lessons 
that will enable us to advance and in- 
crease in knowledge and power in th<: 
presence of God, and that will entitle 
us to be numbered among His jewels, 
when He shall come to gather them 
unto Himself. "We 'regard our condi- 
tion here as similar to being away from 
home. We have left our Father and 
Mother in heaven, become self-exiled 
from the associations of our primeval 
existence, and have come down here on 
earth in obedience to the will of God, 
for a wise purpose He has in view. 
We do not look upon life as a pleasure 
ground, as a holiday, we look upon it 
as a school, in which we are engaged 
learning lessons that will fit and quail- 
fy us for the presence of our Father 
in heaven, when we go hence. We do 
not believe we have any time to fritter 
away and waste, or to spend in the 
pursuit of pleasure, or following de- 
lusive fantasms and things that lead 
from the grand purpose of existence 
on the earth; we believe that our time 
and talents and all that we have and 
are, ought to be dedicated to the ser- 
vice of the Lord, and that we should 
try, to the best of our ability, to carry 
out His purposes concerning us, 
here on earth. It matters not 
what people say of us, if we have a 
conscience void of offense towards God 
and man. If we know we are persecut- 
ed for righteousness sake, it matters 
not, we can rejoice that we are thus 
privileged. I do not believe it proves 



H. WOODRUFF. 23 

that a people are wicked or corrupt be- 
cause they are made to suffer. I believe 
the people of the world will yet find out 
there is such a thing as suffering for 
righteousness sake. I believe the Sa- 
vior spoke the truth when He said: 
"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile 
you, and persecute you, and shall say 
all manner of evil against you falsely, 
for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceed- 
ing glad; for great is your reward in 
heaven; for so persecuted they the 
prophets which were before you." It 
matters not that our accusers, those 
who find fault with our religious belief 
and principles, are the fashionable, the 
educated and cultured of the world; 
Jesus Christ was accused by such. He 
was brought to judgment by law, and 
His accusers were the high and grand 
among men, Scribes and Pharisees, who 
offered long prayers in public places, to 
be heard of men, who were careful in 
the observance of outward forms and 
ceremonies, "righteous" men! men who 
were in such condition that they could 
not cast the first stone at the woman 
taken in adultery.but who were grieved 
in spirit because Jesus went about "ut- 
tering blasphemy" by saying he was the 
Son of God. Those were the influences, 
the kind of witnesses, and testimony 
that were brought to' bear against Je- 
sus of Nazareth, which brought about 
His conviction, and death of ignominy 
upon the cross. The lawyers of today 
tell us that His death was a judicial 
murder; so we see, my brethren and 
sisters, it is possible for the law to be 
wrong. It is sometimes possible for a 
few people to be in the right and the 
rest of mankind in the wrong. It is pos- 
sible for people to have to submit to an 
erroneous human law. 

The Saints of God are required to 
prove themselves, by retaining the tes- 
timony of Jesus Christ in the face of 
persecutions and affliction. We have 
been charged with being an immoral 
people. We frequently meet this in our 
labors in the missionary field; but if 
intelligent individuals will consider the 
history of this people they will And a 
refutation of the charge in the lives of 
the Latter-day Saints. Surely those 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



were not immoral people who put their 
wives and children into covered wagons 
crossed fifteen hundred miles of unex- 
plored country, exposed to dangers and 
hardships incident to the settling of a 
new and wild country, and to savage 
beasts and savage human beings! It is 
not the practice of immoral people to 
pursue the arduous avocations and ex- 
hibit the self-sacrificing characteristics 
•orur people have. We know it is not 
the sin and wickedness of the world 
that our maligners are fighting. It is 
the Church and kingdom of God that is 
being assailed, and that, too, in a land 
of liberty, in the land of Washington, 
the land of Jefferson, the land of patri- 
ots, who fought, bled and died that they 
might hand down to us, their descend- 
ants in many instances, the priceless 
boon of religious liberty. We resent 
in our feelings this condition; the in- 
consistency of the position of many peo- 
ple of the world. We claim the right 
to enjoy religious liberty, and adhere 
to the declaration of the patriots that 
this land should, as intended, be a land 
where all might worship God according 
to the dictates of their conscience, as 
long as they do not infringe upon the 
rights or liberties of their fellowmen. 
I am at the defiance of the world to 
prove that the Latter-day Saints have 
ever infringed upon the rights of oth- 
ers. They have been persecuted and 
trodden upon for their religion's sake, 
but they are willing that other people 
shall enjoy their convictions in this re- 
gard. We will try to treat all man- 
kind as brothers and sisters. We will 
treat them as fellow-citizens until they 
prove themselves unworthy. But we do 
not propose to shake hands with the 
devil, so to speak, to show how liberal 
and generous we are. We have nothing 
to do with him nor his ways, for he 
fell and was cast out, with other rebel- 
lious spirits, and he became the devil. 
He and his host of unembodied spirits, 
if they could have had their way, would 
have compelled men to follow their 
course, and do as they directed, but 
that was not according to the plan of 
our Father in heaven. He designed 
that we should all enjoy religious lib- 



erty, and be free moral agents unto 
ourselves; and it is because we insist 
upon this principle, and this rule, that 
we have, in a measure, become obnox- 
ious in the jsight of our fellow-men. The 
devil is not dead, by any means, nor 
his hosts, but he is "continually going 
up and down in the earth seeking whom 
he may devour," as the Scriptures say, 
putting it into the hearts of one class 
to persecute another class of people, 
and trying to draw men from virtue to 
vice and to bring them down to death. 
It is necessary for us to be true to our 
covenants, and to teach the world what 
"Mormonism" really is, that it is the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, restored to the 
earth in the day and time in which we 
live. 

We have every reason, my brethren 
and sisters, to feel encouraged in the 
work in which we are engaged. The 
word of our Father in heaven has been 
declared that this Church, which is the 
embryo of the kingdom that* will come 
and govern during the millennium, 
shall not be overthrown or given to an- 
other people. We do not need to look 
forward with such uncertainty as the 
early Saints, who were taught by the 
Apostles that an apostasy would take 
place. It is different in our time, for 
we have the assurance, through the 
prophets of God, that this work shall 
not be overthrown, whether we, as in- 
dividuals, fall or not, the work of God 
will continue. Now, I pray that the 
blessings of the Lord will continue 
with us during the meetings of 
our conference and that we may 
go away much refreshed and strength- 
ened. May God add His blessing; I 
ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON, 

(President of California mission.) 
For the few moments I shall stand 
before you, my brethren and sisters, I 
sincerely desire your prayers of faith, 
for one of the hardest things in my ex- 
perience has been to speak to the Saints 
of God. I am not afraid of the people of 
the world, because we have a message 
to bear to them. We can tell them of 
the revealed Gospel, that God has set 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



25 



His hand to reclaim His chosen people 
from the four corners of the earth, that 
His kingdom has been set up in these 
the last days, never more to be thrown 
down or given to another people. We 
can tell them of the gifts, of the offi- 
cers and of the ordinances of the 
Church. We can tell them that God 
has again revealed Himself to men in 
the flesh, and that He has sent His an- 
gels with messages of great joy for 
the salvation of the souls of men. This 
is new and strange to them, but to the 
Saints of God, who have grown famil- 
iar with these teachings, it seems that 
it is like "carrying coal to Newcastle" 
for me to speak to you upon these 
things. I know that the Gospel is true. 
I feel in every fibre of my being that 
Jesus is the Christ. I know that Jo- 
seph Smith was His prophet, and was 
the agent in the hands of God in es- 
tablishing His work in the last days, 
never more to be thrown down or giv- 
en to another people, although we may 
fall individually, as my brother has 
said. 

I rejoice in mingling with my broth- 
ers and sisters. There is nothing dear- 
er to the heart of the missionary, it 
seems to me, than to come to Zion and 
commune with the Saints, and hear the 
testimonies and receive the instructions 
of those who are called to preside, those 
men who are the living oracles of God 
upon the earth. My heart was lifted up 
in praise, and my courage was 
strengthened in the testimonies borne 
this morning by the First Presidency of 
this Church, in the message of peace 
and good will unto all men, which 
should characterize the efforts of every 
Latter-day Saint, and particularly the 
missionary. Like Isaiah of old I felt to 
say: 

"How beautiful upon the mountains 
are the feet of him that bringeth good 
tidings, that publisheth peace; that 
bringeth good tidings of good, that pub- 
lisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, 
Thy God reigneth! 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the 
voice- with the voice together shall 
thev sing; for they shall see eye to eye, 
when the Lord shall bring again Zion. 

We live in that day and age, my 
brothers and sisters. The Lord has 



gathered His children from the east and 
from the west, from the north and from 
the south, even every one that is called 
by His name, and has brought them 
and established them, as foreseen of 
old, in the tops of the mountains, where 
the house of God has been erected, 
that the fulfillment of the promise made 
of old, that the hearts of the children 
should be turned to the fathers and the 
hearts of the fathers to the children, 
might be realized; that this Gospel 
should come in its fulness, and that a 
full fruition of all the promises of the 
ancient prophets might be realized 
in this generation and link the dead 
past with the present, reach out into 
the future and make the children of 
God one in the knowledge of the Gcspel, 
enjoying its fruits and realizing its 
promises. 

These men who have been called to 
preside are the oracles that keep us 
in the straight and narrow way. If it 
were not for them it wo dd not be long 
before we would be in the same condi- 
tion as the people of the world: we 
would forget the plan of salvation; we 
wo'dd change the ordinances and trans- 
gress the law; we would be left in 
darkness; we would be leaders of the 
blind. When men tell us that the 
Scriptures are complete and contain all 
that is necessary for salvation, I would 
ask: Why, then, do men in this d;iy — 
men who profess to be scribes and 
scholars, who have been tutored in the 
seminaries of the land to be teachers of 
the word of God to the people— why do 
they differ as to the rendit'on of those 
Scriptures? Why will some tell us that 
belief alone in the Lord Jesus Christ is 
su;ticient to save us, and others just as 
well educated, just as well housed as to 
their places of worship, just as pop ilar 
among the people and with a following 
iMst as large, wiK say it is necessary 
that men should be baptized? Then, 
again those who agree upon the neces- 
sity of baptism differ as to how it 
should be performed, whether it should 
be by sprinkling, by pouring or by im- 
mersion, and others will say: We we'- 
come you into our faith and will ad- 



26 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



minister this ordinance in any form you 
desire it. If the canon of Scriptures is 
full, and it is not necessary to have oth- 
er teachings along this line, to make 
things plain nor to have living oracles, 
why this disparity in the teachings of 
the scribes and scholars, and those who, 
like the Jewish scholars of old, have 
been instructed in colleges of learning, 
and yet differ as to these things? Who 
will tell us definitely from the Scrip - 
tures, and settle the controversy, as to 
who can perform marriages and how i! 
should be done? For whatever the 
Lord God doeth, we are told, is forever. 
Who among the Christian ministers will 
dare to perform a marriage for time 
and all eternity? and yet God gave, 
by the hands of His prophets, wives un- 
to His servants, and it was forever. 
Tell us who should partake of the sac- 
rament, whether it should be the Priest 
alone, the close communicant, or all the 
people. Tell us upon what day we 
should worship; should it be upon the 
Sabbath of the Jew (Saturday), or Sun- 
day, the day of the Lord, as observed 
by the Christian churches? Tell us, if 
the canon of scripture is full, who has 
the authority to minister in the rites of 
baptism, of which we have been speak- 
ing, whether it should be the Deacon, or 
the Priest, or the Elder. It is not nec- 
essary, regarding these ordinances and 
rituals of the Gospel, that God should 
reveal the way, and make it clear to His 
people how these things should be 
done? These men in the world, who 
would teach us, have the Bible, and 
many of them have studied it closely, 
and are converted largely to its teach- 
ings, and yet there is all this diversity 
of opinion regarding these things. 

Recently I was at the Stanford Uni- 
versity, and upon the bulletin board 
there I read a proposition like this, 
which was to be debated upon: "Re- 
solved that a new religion, for all men 
and for all time, should be established 
for the human race." Down in the city 
of Los Angeles I observed a new struc- 
ture going up, bearing the name of 
"The Church of the New Christian Re- 



ligion." I thought to myself that the 
people of the earth, those outside of 
our own Church, feel the necessity of 
living oracles, else why debate this 
question? else why establish a church 
called the new Christian religion? If 
the principles that were set forth by 
Christ and His Apostles were main- 
tained in their purity, and complete- 
ness, there would be no need to estab- 
lish such a church, nor to debate such a 
question; for the . Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is the power of God unto 
salvation. It does not deal with the 
past alone, nor with the uncertain fu- 
ture, but with the living issues of to- 
day. Within it is that agency that will 
uplift and save humanity in every land 
and clime, if they will but heed its 
teachings. There is nothing that the 
heart of man can conceive of, that is 
desirable and good, that is not included 
in the Gospel. There has been no sys- 
tem of ethics evolved that parallels the 
teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, as 
contained in the fulness of the Gospel. 
Despite the scattered truths that were 
revealed by Christ, and the great men 
of the earth since His days, those who 
have spent years in writing ethical 
truths have never been able to eclipse 
the old pagan fathers of Greece, who 
knew not the Lord Jesus Christ, nor 
His teachings, and they have never 
evolved a better scheme for the evolu- 
tion of mankind, to bring them to a 
plane of perfection. It takes the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ to do 
this thing; but the people of God 
are in the minority, as they have 
ever been since the earth was or- 
ganized, apparently, for no sooner 
did Adam and Eve commence to beget 
sons and daughters than there were 
those who strove against the 
righteous and the righteousness 
of the law. Although Goa had in- 
structed Adam not only in His word 
and in the plan of life and salvation, 
as we can see from the scriptures, but 
also in the art of agriculture, how to 
prune and dress the vine, how to clothe 
their own bodies, and how to live, yet, 
notwithstanding this, Adam's sons re-

belled against the truth, and one of 
them put to death righteous Abel. Even 
in the time of Noah, despite the fact 
that there were many great men, such 
as Jared, Laraech, Cainan, Methuselah 
and Enoch, who heard the testimony of 
father Adam— and one of them, Enoch, 
had walked with God for 320 years- 
yet the majority of the people in that 
day turned a deaf ear to the word of 
God. Noah labored with them upwards 
of 120 years to convert them to the 
testimony of their fathers. Many of 
them, doubtless, had a knowledge of the 
Lord, and knew that He had appeared 
and talked with men, and yet how few 
received his testimony. Well, after this 
time, we find that even Abraham had to 
flee from his father's household, and 
from the idols his father worshiped, and 
go into a strangs land and among a 
strange people to receive the Priesthood 
of the fathers— which, by right, be- 
longed to him— that he, too, might wor- 
ship the Lord God, according to the 
dictates of his conscience, free and un- 
trammeled from the superstitions and 
unjust laws of his father's house- 
hold. It was not the majority 
even, that believed after the miracu- 
lous manifestations of the Lord in 
Egypt. Although He brought His peo- 
ple from that land and overturned, one 
by one, the gods of the Egyptians, what 
a short time it was after Moses was 
removed from them that they forgot 
God, and returned to the worship of the 
Egyptian god, Ammon, symbolized by 
the calf made by Aaron and his broth- 
er, and, as a result, the wrath of God 
prevented all, save two, from going in 
to the promised land. Take the history 
of the prophets later: They were sub- 
jected to insults and injuries, and many 
of them were put to death by the peo- 
ple who said we have no need of 
prophets, we have Moses for our pro- 
phet and have no need of thee. This his- 
tory was repeated in the days of the 
Savior who called the people to account 
because they embellished the sepulchers 
of the prophets, but stoned to death the 
living prophets. It was the Savior who 
said to the people of His own country 
who were offended at him: "A prophet 



is not without honor, save in his own 
country, and in his own house." He was 
put to death, and His Apostles, save 
one, were all put to death because of 
the testimony they bore,, and that, too, 
largely by those who were looked upon 
as the wise of the earth, students and 
scholars of the law. In this day and 
generation, while history has repeated 
itself, by us being in the minority and 
our prophet and his brother and many 
of the Saints being put to death for the 
testimony of Jesus, the promise is made 
unto us that in this day the Gospel will 
continue, as you heard by the mouth 
of the Prophet of God this morning, un- 
til every knee shall bow and every 
tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ, 
when there shall be none to hurt or 
make afraid in all God's holy moun- 
tain. I say, may God hasten the day, 
and may He help us so to live, my 
brethren and sisters, that people abroad 
may sense the fact that our desires are 
to uplift humanity, that "Mormonism" 
has revealed unto us that plan, that 
system, that scheme that will save 
mankind, being the truth which makes 
men free. 

I remember one of my experiences 
upon a railroad train, in speaking to a 
well traveled lady, a scholar, too, upon 
some of the ethics of the day. She had 
been reading from Browning's "Rabbi 
Ben Ezra," or "The Story of Life," on 
the opportunities of men. She dwelt 
largely upon its beauties and the pos- 
sibilities which it held out to men to 
become Godlike. Without telling her 
who I was, I elaborated upon and ex- 
plained to her the belief of the Latter- 
day Saints regarding the opportunities 
and talents that God has endowed us 
with, telling her that inherent within 
us are the attributes of Deity, and that 
we only lack the time and opportunity 
to develop these things to become like 
the Father. As I dwelt upon this sub- 
ject at some length, she became great- 
ly enthused, and, having learned my 
name, she said: "O, Mr. Robinson, I 
think a man who entertains such phil- 
osophy as you do must be able to reach 
out into the infinite, and clasp hands 
with the Creator, and be lifted away 



28 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



from the things of this mundane 
sphere; that there is nothing mean or 
low that a man who has such grand 
ideals could stoop to do." She talked 
in this way and looked at me rather 
curiously, and at last I asked her if she 
would not like to know what school of 
philosophy I belonged to. She said she 
would, and I told her that I was 
an Elder of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, common- 
ly called "Mormons." She exclaimed, 
"O, horror! horror! I would not have 
sat there if I had known that." After 
a while, when she had to get off the 
train, having considerable baggage, I 
proffered my assistance, and she ac- 
cepted it, but I told her that before I 
would help her off I would like to ask 
her a question or two. "Why is it that 
when I told you of the philosophy of 
the evolution of man along the lines of 
right, and all that is good and legiti- 
mate, that you praised it as the grand- 
est philosophy you ever heard of, and 
said it was soul-satisfying and elevat- 
ing, and that it lifted men above the 
mundane things of this sphere, and then 
when I told you that this was the phil- 
osophy of the 'Mormon' people you 
turned away from me in disgust and 
derision." "Well," she said, "Mr. Rob- 
inson, it is such a horrid name; why 
can't you call yourselves something 
else?" I rejoice in the name we bear, 
my brethren and sisters, that of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. Have you ever thought of 
the fact that, out of the hundreds of 
churches and isms in the world, ours is 
the only one that bears the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and that even 
nineteen hundred years after the Sa- 
vior's time upon the earth? Of all the 
churches I have heard of, and we have 
a great many in California, the one that 
came the nearest to that name was an 
independent church on Broadway, in 
Los Angeles, called "the independent 
Church of Christ" — not the Church of 
Jesus Christ. 

I rejoice in the Gospel and in the op- 
portunities that it holds out to us, and 
in the assurance it gives me that we 
shall live, as spoken of by Brother 



Pratt this afternoon, and be clothed 
upon with eternal youth and everlasting 
life, associate with our loved ones, and 
answer the full end of our creation; 
that all of the grand ideals, all of the 
hopes and ambitions that are God-like 
in this life shall be met with a full 
complement, and be realized to the full- 
est extent in the life to come, and we 
shall rule and reign forever with Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and help us to realize these things, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir then sang, "Count Tour 
Many* Blessings." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

I am ready to confess that I am keyed 
up to a pretty high tension, and the 
only thing I am afraid of is that I will 
say just what I think, which would be 
unwise, no doubt. 

I feel a good deal, or at least I ima- 
gine I do, like a man does when held 
up by a burglar and he is looking into 
the muzzle of a six-shooter. I would 
quietly and willingly hold my hands up, 
but during the time would think very 
profoundly of what I would do if given 
my liberty. We are in a similar posi- 
tion today, but all the men in the Unit- 
ed States cannot prevent a man from 
thinking. There are not Apostles 
enough in the Church to prevent us 
from thinking, and they are not dis- 
posed to do so; but some people fancy 
because we have the Presidency and 
Apostles of the Church they will do the 
thinking for us. There are men and 
women so mentahy lazy that they hard- 
ly think for themselves. To think calls 
for effort, which makes some men tired 
and wearies their souls. Now, brethren 
and sisters, we are surrounded with, 
such conditions that it requires not 
only thought, but the guidance of the 
Holy Spirit. Latter-day Saints, you 
must think for vourselves. No man 
or woman can remain in this Church 
on borrowed light. I am a strong be- 
liever in the following statement made 
by my father in the House of the Lord 
in 1856 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



29 



"We think we are secure in the 
chambers of the everlasting hills, but 
the time will come when we will be so 
mixed up that it will be difficult to tell 
the face of a Saint from the face of an 
enemy to the people of God. Then, 
brethren, look out for the great sieve, 
for there will be a great sifting time, 
and many will fall; for I say unto you 
there is a test, a test, a TEST com- 
ing, and who will be able to stand?" 

I think we are able to decide thpse 
matters for ourselves, through the 
grace and favor of the Lord. We ought 
to know where we stand. There are 
a multitude of thoughts springing up 
into the minds of the people regarding 
our present condition, and as for my- 
self, I believe if we, as Latter-day 
Saints, those of us who have a testimo- 
ny, will testify that Jesus is the Christ 
and Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, 
it will bring us all the trouble we can 
stand. At least, that has been my 
experience. Our special mission and 
calling is to see to it that all peoples 
and nations hear the glad tidings of 
great joy. Personally, I have no feel- 
ings against the Gentiles and those 
who are not of our faith, and I can say 
it honestly, thanking the Lord that T 
am broad minded enough to carry the 
olive branch in my hand and preach 
the Gospel of peace to the nations of 
the earth; but when it comes to apos- 
tates and our own people lifting up 
their voices against us, I tell you there 
is not influence enough to restrain me 
from rebuking them. I am not will- 
ing to fold my hands and stand silently 
by and hear apostates abuse our lead- 
ers and people. Why? Because they 
know better. They have been taught, 
nurtured and warmed at our hearths, 
and they know they falsify the truth. 
I will say to the Latter-day Saints, I 
have no use for a traitor, unless he will 
speedily repent of that great sin. I 
do not believe the Lord will give to a 
traitor salvation, unless he repents. 
The people of these United States have 
no use for a traitor. The Masons have 
no earthly use for them, neither have 
the Methodists, Baptists, or any other 
Christian people, and I join them in the 
cry against traitors and those that 
love and make lies. 



I will now read to you a few words 
from the sayings of the Prophet of the 
Lord, at a meeting held in Nauvoo, 
Illinois, July 2nd, 1839, with the Twelve 
Apostles and some of the Seventies who 
were about to go on their missions to 
EuroDe. 

"O ye Twelve!" said Joseph, "and 
all Saints! Profit by this important 
key— that in all your trials, troubles, 
temptations, afflictions, bonds, im- 
prisonments, and death, see to it, that 
you do not betray heaven; that you 
do not betray Jesus Christ; that you 
do not betray the brethren; that you do 
not betray the revelations of God, 
whether in the Bible, Book of Mormon, 
or Doctrine & Covenants, or any other 
that ever was or ever will be given and 
revealed unto man in this world, or 
that which is to come. Yea, in all 
your kicking and floundering, see to it 
that ye do not this thing, lest in- 
nocent blood be found on your skirts, 
and you go down to hell. All other 
sins are not to be compared to sinning 
against the Holy Ghost, and proving a 
traitor to thy brethren." 

I pray God to bless you, my broth- 
ers and sisters. I wish there was more 
time for us to speak to the people. I 
say to you, as a servant of the Lord 
and as a watchman upon the towers, 
it is high time that we were looking 
up. I tell you, if there is anything 
on earth that we need in the Church, 
in this day in which we live, it is not 
money or temporal power, it is a spirit- 
ual uplifting, and it must take place in 
Zion, or else there will be a falling 
away. 

Now, brothers and sisters, in your 
comments and conversations and in 
expressing your views, see to it that 
you do not express yourselves thought- 
lessly before the rising generation; 
don't pass your opinion too quickly.and 
by doing so cause the young people to 
fall away from the Church, for they 
have not received the testimonies that 
you have. You have a great mission 
to perform at home. See to it that 
you do not "lift up the heel against 
the Lord's annointed," crying out that 
they have transgressed, for the Lord

says, "those who cry transgression, do 
it because they are the servants of sin, 
and are the children of disobedience 
themselves." 

May the Lord bless, direct and pros - 
per this people, I ask it in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID H. CANNON, 
(President of St. George Temple). 

I have rejoiced in listening to the tes- 
timonies of the brethren who have pre- 
ceded me this afternoon, and in the 
words of counsel and admonition we re- 
received from the Prophet of the Lord 
and His counselors, in the meeting of 
the conference held this morning. I 
desire that, during the few moments I 
shall occupy, my utterances may be 
under the guidance of the Spirit of God, 
because this is His work with which wa 
have become identified. 

I was very pleased with the remarks 
of President Kimball, in regard to being 
true to the Gospel, and to the obliga- 
tions we have assumed in connection 
with this great latter-day work. I re- 
member meeting a man wno had been 
diligent during his early experience in 
the Church, who had been valiant in 
testimony regarding the principles of 
the Gospel that God had revealed for 
the redemption of His people. This man 
left the Church, after having been 
faithful to the Gospel for many years. 
I asked him how it was that he had 
lost the testimony. He said he could 
not say, that he was just as sincere af- 
ter he denied the faith as he was at the 
time he was preaching the Gospel. I 
met him again, a few years afterwards, 
when he was reunited with the Curch, 
and I asked him how he accounted for 
these changes. He told me that the 
cause of his apostasy was made known 
by the revelations of the Lord to him, 
and that it was because he had grieved 
the Spirit of tne Lord by talking against 
his brethren, men who were appointed 
to preside over him. He told me that 
President Young had inaugurated co- 
operation in temporal affairs, and that! 
it came in contact with his own pre- 
conceived ideas; that he murmured 
against President Young, and also 
against others of the servants of God, 



and the Spirit of God became grieved 
and by degrees withdrew from him, 
and he was left to himself. As he fell 
into darkness he neglected his duties, 
neglected to say his prayers and to live 
according to the requirements of the 
Gospel, until his mind became blank, 
the light that had shone within him be- 
fore ceased, and he was an apostate. 
Subsequently the Lord touched his un- 
derstanding, and caused him to realize 
his position; he then began to see if ha 
could not regain the light by humbling 
himself before the Lord and manifest- 
ing exceeding humility. By degrees, 
the Spirit returned to him, and the 
light in its glory, and the beauties of 
the Gospel, dawned upon his mind, and 
he again became faithful and diligent, 
and continued so until the time of hi9 
death. Now, the light of the sun, when 
it illuminates the world, does not come 
suddenly, for we, with our natural 
eyes, would not be able to endure it. If 
you will arise early in the morning you 
will, probably, see the morning star 
preceding the daylight, then a glimmer 
of sunrise in the east, and, as time ad- 
vances, the earth becomes bathed in 
an effulgence of light, and, by its coraJ 
ing gradually, we are able to endure it> 
Just so with the Gospel. The princi-' 
pies God has revealed for the redemp- 
tion of His people do not manifest 
themselves to the people suddenly, but 
the man who conforms to the first prin- 
ciples, having faith in the Lord Jesus, 
repenting of his sins, going down into 
the water and being baptized for the 
remission of his sins, receives the Holy 
Ghost, which will lead him into al> 
truth. As he obeys the laws of the 
Gospel, and conforms to its sacred re-* 
quirements, his understanding of the 
Gospel broadens; but when he ceases to 
do right the light of truth begins to 
wane within him. As long as he proves 
faithful and diligent in the observance 
of the laws of God has revealed, that 
light continues to grow within him, and 
the Gospel satisfies his heart's desir* 
in the shape of religion; but 
when he becomes derelict in his 
duties, and begins to neglect his 
prayers, and speak evil of the

servants of God, criticising those who 
bear the Holy Priesthood who preside 
over him, then the light begins to wane 
again, and the Spirit of God withdraws 
until he is left entirely to himself. 

This work, my brethren and sisters, 
is the work of God. He has revealed 
it to bring mankind back into His pres-> 
ence. By strict obedience to its require- 
ments we will have joy in our life and 
labors; when we neglect to conform t* 
its teachings, the reverse will be the re- 
sult. Mav God enable us to compre- 
hend properly the principles He has 
revealed, and to live by every word that 
proceedeth from His mouth, is my de- 
sire, through Jesus Christ, our Re- 
deemer. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

I have very greatly rejoiced my 
brethern and sisters, in listening to 
the good words that have been spoken 
to us by our brethern this afternoon; 
I also rejoiced in listening to the tes- 
timonies and counsel that were impart- 
ed to us by the Presidency of the 
Church in the opening session of our 
conference. I have no doubt but what 
there was a feeling of joy and satis- 
faction in the hearts of all the Saints 
who were assembled together, in listen- 
ing to the words that were spoken by 
President Smith and by his associates 
in the Presidency. We ought to be able, 
through the training we have received 
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to know 
the voice of the good shepherd and to 
follow him, and not be carried away by 
strange voices or by strange doctrines, 
by the ideas that are presented to us, 
from time to time, by those who are 
not of us. I think we must all have 
felt that we were listening to the voice 
of the good shepherd, that the inspira- 
tion of the Almighty actuated the 
brethren who stand at the head of the 
Church in the counsels that they im- 
parted to us in our morning's ses- 
sion of the conference. We have with- 
in our own souls the understanding 
and knowledge that we are engaged 
in the work of our Father, a work that 
has been revealed from the heavens 
for the salvation of the human race, a 
work that has been spoken of by the 
mouths of all the holy prophets since 



the beginning of time, a work that was 
engaged in by the Redeemer of men 
when He dwelt for a little season in 
the flesh. 

Every man who bears a testimony, 
understandingly and truthfully, of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, knows that the 
knowledge he is in possession of has 
come to him by the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost, that it has been given by 
the revelations of the Father, and that 
he is not dependent upon man for a 
continuation of that knowledge. We 
depend, my brethren and sisters, upon 
the continuation of a knowledge of the 
Gospel, that we are in possession of, 
through keeping the commandments of 
God. Through keeping these com- 
mandments we can also depend upon 
the fulfilment of the promises made 
pertaining to the future. If we are to 
have a realization of the glorious things 
spoken of today it will be through at- 
tending to the duties and responsibili- 
ties that rest upon us as members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We must live in the pres- 
ent and attend to our duties as they 
are made known to us, if we are to 
have the approval of our Father in 
Heaven, and if we desire to make our 
calling and election sure. God has 
pointed out the way whereby we can 
make our calling and election sure. 

Those who are not of us seem to 
think, sometimes, that it is a dreadful 
doctrine to teach that we should honor 
the Priesthood, as spoken of by some 
of the brethren today, that we should 
be careful not to lift up our voices in 
criticism of the authority of God, and 
that there is danger in pursuing a 
course of this character. It seems to 
me, my brethren and sisters, that we 
ought easily to understand that, if 
God Almighty has spoken from the 
heavens, and has clothed men with His 
authority, and commanded them to 
magnify that authority in the midst 
of the peoples of the earth, He will ex- 
pect the peoples of the earth to recog- 
nize and honor that authority, and 
especially require this of His Saints, 
who have a knowledge of the truth. 
That is a part of the responsibility 
that has come to us through the Gos- 
pel. While we do not believe we should

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



worship men, or that there is any- 
thing in the Gospel that requires any 
man or woman to give undue or improp- 
er reverence 1 to any man, we do be- 
lieve the Gospel requires that every 
soul shall recognize the authority God 
has established, and that they shall 
follow that authority. That has al- 
ways been the case in every age of the 
world. Whenever God has had His 
authority upon the earth he has de- 
manded this of the people; and He has 
abundantly blessed those who have 
hearkened to His counsel, and who 
have been true to His representatives. 

My brethren and sisters, let us take 
warning from the words that have 
been spoken. We should remember 
that the mission of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is and al- 
ways has been. "Peace on earth and 
good will to man," as stated by one 
of the First Presidency this morning. 
It is the mission of this great people- 
not the few men who are abroad in 
the world preaching the Gospel, nor 
just the few men who compose the 
Council of the Twelve, nor any other 
organization of the Priesthood alone — 
it is the mission of the entire people 
that their lives, their conversations and 
example shall declare to all the world 
we love peace. We have received the 
message of truth, and it is our mis- 
sion to bear record to the divine will 
of our Father in heaven and preach 
the Gospel, that men may be saved. 
Our Father revealed in the very begin- 
ning of this work, as men became 
anxious to know the will of God con- 
cerning themselves, that the most im- 
portant thing men could do was to cry 
repentance to the people, to teach the 
doctrines of the Gospel, and that if 
they labored through their entire lives 
and saved but one soul, great should 
be their reward and their joy in the 
kingdom of our Father. We need to 
save souls at home; we need to be do- 
ing things, to be laboring diligently, 
that our skirts may be clear, and that 
we may be justified. It is written in 
the revelations that we are not to wait 
to be commanded in all things. Some- 
times we appear to think that the 
Bishop, or some other authority, should 



designate labor for us, and that we are 
not to do anything unless we are in- 
structed or appointed to do it. God 
has said: It is given to man, by his 
own agency, to seek to bring to pass 
much righeousness, of his own voli- 
tion and of his own will, without com- 
mandment from any source; and he 
that waiteth to be commanded in all 
things is a slothful and an unwise 
steward. 

Now, we need to be doing the things 
that have been suggested to us today, 
and the things that will be suggested 
in the counsels that may be imparted 
to us in other meetings. By doing so 
we shall be firmly established in the 
everlasting Gospel, and no experiences 
can ever come to us then that will 
wrest us from the foundation upon 
which we stand, if we stand upon the 
foundation of obedience to the things of 
God we will always see the light and 
rejoice therein. There will be no fear 
in our hearts; for the Spirit of the Lord 
will be with us, and the Spirit of 
the Lord casteth out all fear. God 
bless you, my brethren and sisters, and 
may power be given unto us to be 
true and faithful to our covenants, and 
to each other, and to our Father in 
heaven, is my prayer, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Love Everlasting," 
after which the benediction was pro- 
nounced by Elder Angus M. Cannon. 

OPEN AIR MEETING 

An open air meeting was held on the 
Temple block Sunday afternoon, April 
3, at 2 o'clock. Elder Geo. A. Smith, 
presiding. Singing, "High on the 
Mountain Top." Prayer was offered by 
Elder Rulon S. Wells. Singing, "Guide 
us O Thou Great Jehovah." 

President Wm. T. Jack of the Cassia 
stake, was the first speaker. He re- 
ferred to the restoration of the Gospel 
through the boy Prophet, Joseph Smith, 
and showed the necessity for authority 
to baptize and administer in the laws 
and ordinances thereof, such authority 
as was held by the Apostles and Saints 
of old and which was taken from the 
earth when they passed away. It was 
necessary to be restored to prepare the 
hearts of the people for the coming of

the Master. The speaker admonished 
the Saints to continue to live lives of 
purity that they might in very deed be 
the people of God and a light unto the 
nations. 

Elder Benj. Goddard spoke upon the 
subject of baptism for the dead. He 
showed how unjust it would be to con- 
demn and cast into perdition the mil- 
lions who had not had an opportunity 
of hearing or believing the sacred Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ. Said that beyond 
the grave the Gospel is being preached 
now, even as Christ himself went to the 
spirits in prison for this purpose. Bap- 
tism, he said, is an indispensable prin- 
ciple. How strange it would be for 
Christ to preach the necessity of bap- 
tism without providing a way in which 
His instructions and commands might 
be obeyed. Since baptism is an earthly 
ordinance it must be performed on 
earth, and as Christ ha,s done a vicar- 
ious work for us, so may we work vi- 
cariously for others and thus become 
saviors on Mt. Zion. The speaker 
quoted scripture to prove his remarks, 
dwelling emphatically on the saying 
"Else what shall they do which are 
baptized for the dead? If the dead rise 
not at all why then are ye baptized for 
the dead?" 

Elder Arnold H. Schulthess spoke of 
the wonderful and rapid growth of the 
Church, and how the Spirit of God and 
the spirit of sacrifice took hold of the 
people's hearts in foreign lands and led 
them to the land of Zion to establish an 
ensign of righteousness on the moun- 
tain tops. He closed by bearing a 
strong testimony to the truthfulness of 
the Gospel. 

President James G. Duffin of the 
Southwestern States mission read from 
the Doctrine and Covenants a revelation 
concerning the Gospel, as revealed to 
Joseph Smith, being preached to all 
the world. He showed the great mis- 
sionary work being done by the Saints 
and the sacrifice the "Mormon" people 
are making to proclaim to the world 
the blessed principles of life and lib- 
erty for which the Master was cruci- 
fied, and for which Saints in former 
and latter days have been willing to 
live and die. Over 52 nations of the 



earth have already been visited by the 
Elders, and the work will continue* un- 
til all nations shall hear it, and until 
righteousness shall cover the earth as 
the waters cover the deep. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells continued the 
theme of the rapid growth of the 
Church, citing instances where God's 
power has been manifest in the 
Church's development. He referred to 
the natural and strange desire among 
the Saints abroad to come to Zion when 
they receive the Spirit, notwithstanding 
th e opposition that might be "c-ought 
to prevent them. He showed that the 
Spirit of God bears testimony to them 
that they are the people of God, as it 
did to the Apostle Paul, Peter and the 
other Apostles and Saints. He said the 
gates of hell had not prevailed against 
the Gospel when the Master was nailed 
upon the cross, but that was the great- 
est victory the Church had ever known. 
The work of redemption defied the 
gates of hell and lifted men to their Re- 
deemer. 

President Ben E. Rich of the Southern 
States mission read the hymn, "Oh My 
Father," and commented upon the 
same. He proved by Scripture that our 
spirits had a pre-existence. Christ was 
the Lamb slain before the foundation of 
the world, to be wounded for our trans- 
gressions and bruised for our iniquities, 
that by His stripes we may be healed. 
Jeremiah was chosen and ordained a 
Prophet of God. Job was one of the 
sons of Gcd who shouted when the 
morning stars sang together and the 
sons of God shouted for joy. We 
were sent here as to a school to prepare 
us for the higher grade we may enter in 
the land of eternal progression. 

There is a secret something that whis- 
pers to us we are but strangers here, 
that dust we are and to dust we shall 
return; but "the spirit shall go back 
to God who gave it." There is a force' 
in the words of the faithful Elders 
abroad which strikes conviction to the 
hearts of many. 

Elder George A. Smith closed by 
bearing a faithful testimony. Singing, 
"Oh ye mountains high" by the con- 
gregation and benediction by Elder 
B. Clegg. 



SECOND DAY. 



Monday, April 4, 10 a. m. 
The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

"Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah, 
Jesus anointed that Prophet and 
Seer." 

Opening prayer by Bishop William 
B. Preston. 

Singing by the choir: 

"Ye simple souls who stray 
Far from the path of peace, 

That lonely, unfrequented way 
To life and happiness." 

ELDER A. O. WOODRUFF. 

The fHith r ul are valiant in the testimony of Jesus — 
The doubtfui are fearful In times of danger — 
Power to resist temptation— Tre kingdom of 
God can be seen on y by the obedient. 

My dear brothers and sisters, I hope 
that through the blessings of the Lord 
I may be able to make you hear, and 
be guided by the Spirit of our Heaven- 
ly Father in my utterances. I desire 
to say only those things that the Lord 
would have me to say. I feel very 
thankful to the Lord for a testimony 
of the divinity of this work, for a 
knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, 
and that Joseph Smith was divinely 
commissioned of our Heavenly Father 
to establish this work, which has at- 
tracted the attention and the interest, 
either for or against it, of so many 
people. If it were not 'that God is at 
the helm, and directing this work, it 
had as well been abandoned many 
years ago; but the great assurance 
which has possessed this people in 
•every hour of trouble, has been that 
God would deliver them and lead them 
out of every difficulty, stronger in faith 
and in numbers than before. That has 
been the history of our people. Had it 
not been for this testimony, that the 
Lord Himself is the author of this work, 
the conditions which have arisen in 
the past would have caused the people's 



hope to sink within them, and the 
outlook would have been very forbid- 
ding. 

From time to time we may expect 
trouble and difficulty, because the Lord 
has decreed that He would have a 
tried people; that he would purify the 
gold in the fire, but that none of the 
gold should be lost. The dross would 
be consumed, and the gold should still 
remain. Such has been the past ex- 
perience of this latter-day work, which 
has grown so marvelously under the 
persecution and the trouble which has 
beset it, ever since it was started by 
the Lord through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. The Latter-day Saints, as a 
rule, are not easily shaken by condi- 
tions, however trying they may be. 
The experience of the past has shown 
us that the few men who have fallen 
by the wayside, because they were 
f?lled with fear when trouble arose, 
have signally failed in their efforts to 
lead others from the Church. The ma- 
jority of the people of God to~day are 
not easily moved nor frightened; 
their hearts do not sink within them 
when clouds appear upon our horizon. 
I believe it is pleasing in the sight of 
the Lord when His people have suffi- 
cient faith not to be easily moved, so 
that when any difficulties arise, or 
whenever they are beset by the enemies 
of righteousness, thev do not feel that 
the whole work is going to pieces, and 
that the Church can no longer make 
the remarkable progress it has made 
up to the present time. Our past history 
should be a strength unto us, and a 
hope for the future. It should stimulate 
our faith in God. Indeed, in the minds 
of those who have a testimony of the 
truth, there is no doubt whatever in re- 
gard to the outcome of this work. They 
know it will triumph over all its adver- 
saries, no matter how powerful they 
may be. Whatever agencies are organ- 
ized to oppose the work, they know 



ELDER A. O. WOODRUFF. 



35 



that God is all-powerful, and 
that He rules the destinies of men and 
nations, and He will bring His work to 
victory in the end. So the Latter-day 
Saints who are doing- their duty are 
not easily moved. On the other hand, 
whenever anything has arisen in the 
shape of opposition, and whenever the 
clouds have been dark and threaten- 
ing, those who were weaK, because they 
were not doing their duty and keeping 
the commandments Of the Lord, have 
always been the ones who thought the 
work was going to pieces, and that "the 
bottom was falling out of Mormonism." 
Whenever members of the Church have 
such feelings within them it is an evi- 
dence of their own weakness, and of the 
fact that they are not keeping the com- 
mandments of God, because of which 
they have not the assurance regarding 
the final victory of this work that a 
faithful man possesses. We expect 
there will be opposition, but at the same 
time we confidently expect that God, in 
the future as in the past, will deliver 
us if we will only do our duty. We 
never intend to so shape our faith and 
belief that it will please the adversary, 
or the world. The present chaotic con- 
dition of Christendom, with its jarring, 
differing sects, presents a practical il- 
lustration of what the Gospel would 
be if it were cut and pruned to suit the 
wishes of the enemy of all righteous- 
ness. This Gospel tree which was 
planted in the meridian of time by 
Jesus Himself and which was nurtured 
by Him and His followers, was shorn 
of many of its limbs and branches to 
suit the wishes of the ungodly, 
until its symmetry was lost. 
The Priesthood was taken 
to God, while those who were devout 
in maintaining the pure principles 
which God had revealed were put to 
death in various ways, because they 
would not recant, and deny the testi- 
mony which God the Eternal Father 
had given to them. These faithful 
souls contended that man must fear 
God rather than man, that he must 
meet his obligations to God, and in so 
doing he could not help but be a good 
citizen of the state. Those who keep 
the commandments of God are certain 



to become a benefit to any community 
in which they live. Most people shiver 
at the thought of trouble, especially if 
it come to them individually. They 
may feel all right if it comes to some 
one else, but when it strikes home 
those who are inclined to be weak and 
doubtful in regard to this work be- 
come very fearful. For their part they 
do not want any persecution. All they 
desire is a smooth road, a pathway 
strewn with roses, where there are no 
obstacles to meet. But we claim that 
this work is divine, and if we expect 
to receive the reward of obedience 
thereto we may expect to labor hard 
for it. If we gain the great reward, 
we shall not be able to shun the fight, 
but will have to be valiant for the 
testimony of Jesus, upholding right- 
eousness, doing our duty to God and to 
our fellow men in every respect. When 
I see men, as I do sometimes, who are 
filled with fear every time there is 
prospect of trouble, I always think of 
the Apostles in the meridian of time. 
I think of how they, rather than deny 
the testimony of Jesus Christ, were 
willing to submit to the most ignomin- 
ious death for the testimony which God 
had given them. 

The pride of the Latter-day Saints 
in regard to this work is that it is 
true, revealed from God to man, and 
that, unlike the various man-made or- 
ganizations there has been no necessi- 
ty to call a convention for the revision 
of its creed, to suit the will and wishe« 
of -mankind. This fact ha s been one 
of the main features which has stim- 
ulated the Saints through all the trou- 
bles and trials which have come to 
them, and one of the things they have 
cherished most. As Latter-day Saints 
we have great reason to rejoice in 
the goodness of the Lord. He 
has never forsaken us; and 
while I do not think that 
we ought to tempt Providence, 
or do unwise things that would bring 
trouble upon us, I have no fear in re- 
gard to the outcome of this work, if 
every man in the Church does his duty 
to God and to his fellow man. The fear 
is, if we have any in regard t« our 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



selves individually, can we keep the 
faith? Can we trust in God in times of 
trouble and adversity as well as in 
times of peace? For my part, I rejoice 
that the Lord is still at the helm. I 
ofttimes think of the experience of the 
Savior, after He had fasted forty days 
and forty nights, and was then tempted 
of the devil. He was shown the king- 
doms of this world, and was promised 
dominion over all of them if He would 
but fall down and worship Satan. What 
was the answer of Jesus? "Get thee 
hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou 
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and 
Him only shalt thou serve." Then He 
was taken upon a pinnacle of the tem- 
ple and told by Satan to cast himself 
down; "for it is written, He shall give 
His angels charge concerning Thee: and 
in their hands they shall bear Thee up, 
lest at any time thou dash thy foot 
against a stone." The Savior answered 
him, "It is written again, thou shalt 
not tempt the Lord thy God." Now, I 
feel that, as Latter-day Saints, we have 
no right to, figuratively, cast ourselves 
from the pinnacle of the temple. God 
expects us to use the wisdom 
He has given us and not to 
tempt Him. Then if trouble 
comes upon us, according to the 
will of God, we will be strong to meet 
it. It is not always those who ap- 
pear anxious to get into a fight who are 
the bravest when the battle is on. More 
frequently those who are the most re- 
luctant to enter the combat are the ones 
who show the best qualities under fire. 
As a people we have never had any de- 
sire for trouble. We only desire to serve 
God and keep His commandments, and 
then to leave the result with Him. By 
doing this we will be justified in the 
eyes of God as well as in the eyes of 
all good men. We never expect the 
wicked or the ungodly to be pleased 
with the plan of life and salvation 
which the Lord has revealed, but we do 
hope that the honest in heart will be 
able to see the kingdom of God as it 
has been established. 

A friend of mine, a few days 
ago, in speaking of that pas- 
sage which is so familiar to us all 



relating the conversation of Christ 
with Nicodemus, brought to my mind 
a new phase of that part of 
it where the Savior says, "Except a 
man be born again he cannot see the 
kingdom of God." In other words, we 
cannot expect a man to see the kingdom 
of God unless he is born again. I had 
never thought of it particularly in this 
light before, but there appears to be 
some force in it. Notwithstanding the 
kingdom of God was established by the 
Redeemer Himself, His enemies could 
not see it because they had not been 
"born' again." It was right among 
them, yet they were not able to per- 
ceive it. The same may be said in re- 
gard to the work which the Lord has 
established in this day. Notwithstand- 
ing the Church and kingdom of God is 
among the people, they see it not, they 
comprehend it not, because they have 
not been "born again." According to 
the words of the Savior, they cannot see 
the kingdom of God unless they are 
born again; consequently they do not 
recognize the fact that the Church of 
Christ is upon the earth, and the king- 
dom of God is here in embryo, because 
they will not receive the light which 
has come into the world, for they love 
the darkness of the world better than 
the light of the Lord. We believe, how- 
ever, that every trouble and adversity 
which the Latter-day Saints are called 
to pass through will tend to call the at- 
tention of the honest in heart to the 
work of God, and will be the means of 
bringing salvation to hundreds and 
thousands. The very agencies which 
our enemies use to defeat this work 
will be overruled by God for the benefit 
of it. It must be very discouraging to 
the enemies of truth when they take a 
retrospective view of the history of the 
Latter-day Saints and see how the Lord 
in His kindness has turned, for the 
blessing and increase of the Latter-day 
Saints and the work of God, all their 
efforts against it. Everything they have 
done to defeat it has only tended to 
strengthen it. This is in accordance 
with the saying of the Lord, that man 
could do nothing against His work, but 
for it.

I love the work in which we are en- 
gaged. I have faith in it and in its 
final outcome. I believe in God the 
Eternal Father, and I know that we 
are able to approach Him. In His lov- 
ing kindness He is mindful of us. We 
have access to Him, and He answers 
our prayers. I know that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Savior of the world, and 
that this is His work, and that it will 
come out triumphant. I thank God 
that I have faith in the leaders of this 
people. I have faith and confidence in 
Joseph F. Smith, the man who stands 
at the head of this Church; I know him . 
to be inspired of God. The Lord is with 
him, and with the help of God I want 
to follow his leadership, observe his 
counsels, and do the will of the Father 
as it shall be expressed through him. 
God grant that the spirit ,—of peace 
which the Gospel brings may pervade 
the homes of all the Latter-day Saints, 
that we may not be filled with fear at 
any time, except in regard to our own 
condition, and lest we may not be keep- 
ing the commandments of God. The 
only reason that we have for fear is 
that we are not living near enough to 
the Lord; but if we are doing His will 
we need not fear, for though all earth 
and hell should assail His work, yet 
will it prosper, because it has the stamp 
of divinity upon it. It is the work of 
God, not of man. This is my humble 
testimony, my brethren and sisters, and 
I rejoice in bearing it, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
desire very much that you will assist 
me by your faith and prayers, that in 
what I shall say I may be led and guid- 
ed by the Spirit of the Lord. When I 
look upon this congregation of friends 
and brethren, my heart rejoices, and I 
am led to a renewal of my faith, and to 
greater confidence in the principles of 
the Gospel and the outcome of the work 
of the Lord. As the days and the years 
advance, the evidences of faith in the 
religion of Jesus Christ are manifested 
by your coming together in these gen- 
eral Conferences. When the first Con- 



ference of the Church was held in the 
State of New York on the ninth day of 
June, 1830, I think there were only 
twenty-six members in the Church at 
that time. When the second Confer- 
ence was held in September of that 
same year.there were thirty-five or thir- 
ty-six. Comparing that Conference with 
the one we are holding at the present 
time, there is certainly evidence that 
the Lord is in this work, not only in 
the increase of numbers, but in the liv- 
ing faith that is in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints today, prompting 
them to faithful labor and to united 
effort in pushing forward the work of 
the Lord. 

Reference was made yesterday to the 
life of our Savior, and to the generally 
accepted idea that yesterday was the 
anniversary of the day on which He 
rose from the tomb. However, whether 
Easter Sunday is the proper day or not, 
we have no objection to it. The great 
underlying fact is that He rose from 
the dead, after having suffered crucifix- 
ion for the sins of the world, and that 
He was the Son of God. After He arose 
He ministered unto His disciples; but 
we are told there was one doubting 
Thomas, who would not believe though 
his fellow disciples assured him they 
had seen the risen Redeemer. After- 
ward, when the Apostles were all to- 
gether in a room, with the doors shut, 
Jesus stood in their midst, and said, 
"Peace be unto you." Turning to Thom- 
as, He said unto him, "Reach hither 
thy finger and behold my hands; and 
reach hither thy hand, and thrust into 
my side: and be not faithless, but be- 
lieving." 

We know today that in the ministry 
of our Lord and Savior there 
were but few who followed Him, as 
compared with the great mass of the 
people. His doctrine did not please 
the multitude. Very few received His 
word and believed that He was the 
Savior of the world, the promised 
Messiah, the expected King of the Jews. 
We note, too, that the persecution 
which came upon Him, His scourgings, 
His buffetings, and His final crucifix- 
ion, were not administered by the 



38 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



heathen, nor by those who had no pro- 
mise in regard to the coming of the 
Messiah. It was His own race, the 
house of Judah, from which He sprang, 
that inflicted upon Him these cruel tor- 
tures, and finally put Him to death 
upon the cross. So it seems to have 
been all along the line of true Chris- 
tian endeavor and work. Wherever 
there has been the Spirit of truth, 
wherever there has been an effort to 
lead humanity into a better way, and 
to mark out a righteous newness of 
life, there has been intense opposition 
exhibited against it by the many. The 
truth has had but few followers, but 
it has had many opposers. 

When the Prophet Joseph Smith was 
inspired by the Lord Almighty to es- 
tablish this work in the earth, he gave 
to it the best efforts of his life. Every 
thought, every reflection of his soul, 
and the love of his whole heart, were 
enlisted in this great work. How great 
it was he possibly did not realize when 
the Lord first communicated to him; 
and even after the Church was or- 
ganized and began to assume a condi- 
tion of some importance in the world, 
even then, no doubt, he was not fully 
aware of the greatness of the structure 
he was instrumental in founding; but 
as revelation was given to him, precept 
upon precept, and line upon line, he 
became more and more filled with the 
Spirit of the Lord, and with enthusiasm 
in regard to the work; and as his en- 
thusiasm grew, and as he became more 
and more endowed with power from 
on high, the efforts of those who op- 
posed him were renewed and redoubled. 
We find that history repeated itself. 
The opposition did not come from the 
heathen, it did not come from non- 
believers in Christ, nor from unbe- 
lievers in ancient prophets and apos- 
tles. It came from men who said they 
believed in the mission of our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, and in the mission 
of His apostles, and that they believed 
He suffered death for the sins of the 
world, and rose again on the third 
day, thus becoming the first fruits 
them that slept, He having the 
key of the resurrection, with power to 



unlock the tomb. So, as I say, we find 
history repeating itself. Opposition to 
this work has not come from those who 
did not believe in Christ, but it has 
come almost invariably from those who . 
have professed to be followers of Christ, 
just as the opposition to the Savior 
came from those who professed to be- 
lieve in His Father. Singular as it 
may appear, it is an everlasting truth 
that there is always opposition to the 
principles of life and salvation, and it 
seems as if the more men profess to 
be enlightened, and the greater their 
professions of faith, the greater is their 
opposition to those who introduce liv- 
ing, saving truths. The fiercest op- 
position to the Savior came from those 
who professed to be the most devout 
in their observance of the law of Mo- 
ses, and who adhered most strictly 
to the forms and rituals of the law. 
And so opposition to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ to this day has come from 
those who appeared the most devout. 

DesDite all this, we are moving along 
in the even tenor of our way, and mak- 
ing some progress. Testimonies are in- 
creasing in the midst of the Saints, and 
as our young people grow up to man- 
hood and womanhood they are receiving 
the testimony of the Gospel, and ar-i 
willing to go forth and devote their lives 
in proclaiming this Gospel. Our mis- 
sionaries now have gone forth to the 
principal nations of Christendom, and 
are lifting up their voices fearlessly in 
proclamation of the truth. Yet we are 
not very popular that I know of in any 
land. Nevertheless, the Gospel is ex- 
tending, Zion is growing, the Saints of 
God are spreading abroad, and todaj' 
our testimonies are brighter than ever 
before. We have deep down in our 
hearts a stronger conviction of the 
truth. We know that God lives, and 
that Jesus Christ is our Savior, who 
died for the sins of the world, that we 
might live. When Easter Sunday 
comes, or when any other Sunday 
comes, it is the Lord's day and we 
reverence His high and holy name. 
We come together and worship Him. 
Thus to us every Sunday, in a sense, is 



ELDER J. G. 

Easter Sunday, for we worship the 
Lord on that day, and not only 
on Sunday, but every day in the 
week. We do not put off the feeling 
of worship on the Monday, nor on 
any other day. If we feel as we 
should, we regard every day as the 
Lord's day, and we feel that we ought 
to serve Him and keep His command- 
ments continuously.and not have a Sun- 
day religion like a Sunday coat, to be 
laid aside as soon as the Sabath day 
is passed. The religion of the Latter- 
day Saints is practical to a wonderful 
degree. Hence, we see that during the 
last four weeks, through the advice and 
counsel of the leaders of the Church, 
we have had four new Stakes of Zion 
organized. Every organization thus 
perfected will add strength to the work, 
and will give greater power to the 
brethern who preside and to the people 
over whom they preside. Moreover, it 
will add to the glory of God, because 
the Saints will live nearer to Him and 
keep His commandments better; for 
where the Saints are thoroughly ad- 
monished, and are in close touch with 
their leaders, the spirit of union, and 
the power to do good and to work 
righteousness, is greatly increased. So 
we rejoice whenever a new stake or a 
new ward is organized. And all this 
is in keeping with the progress of the 
work. We realize, my brethern and 
sisters, that we are not held in very 
high esteem by our friends of the dif- 
ferent Christian faiths of the world; 
but this does not matter. We have our 
work to perform, and if we act well 
our part the Lord will see that His 
work will spread abroad in the earth, 
and that all the honest shall have the 
chance to hear the gospel. I rejoice 
today that we have leaders in our midst 
who know and understand the mind 
and will of the Lord, and who are will- 
ing to devote all their energies and 
their lives for the good of Israel. Un- 
der the inspiration of the Spirit of the 
Lord they prepare for these great Con- 
ferences, and they give us the word of 
the Lord, that we may be encouraged 
from time to time by meeting together 
and hearing their voices in no uncer- 



McQUARRIE. 39 

tain sound proclaim the mind and will 
of the Lord. They point the way in 
which we should walk, and they ad- 
monish us to follow them as they fol- 
low Christ. We have confidence in our 
leaders today, and the Lord has given 
us inspiration to be able to say that 
we know this is His work, and in this 
we are determined to devote our lives 
and the best talent He has given us, 
That we may be faithful and true in 
keeping the commandments of the Lord 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER J. G. McQUARRIE, 
(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

My brothers, sisters and friends, I 
wish I could express the blissful con- 
sciousness I feel thrilling and pulsating 
through my soul in being surrounded 
by thousands of my brothers and sis- 
ters. One can hardly realize this feel- 
ing unless he has been out separated 
from the love that one feels in Zion— 
cast upon the ocean, as it were, like a 
cork amidst the waves, a stranger in 
the community in which he sojourns, 
and after a few years to return to be 
surrounded by thousands of people 
whose faces are lit up Dy the same 
spirit, and to clasp the hands and feel 
the throb of that pulse which beats in 
harmony with his own. I am grateful 
unto God for the blessings of the Gos- 
pel and for this spirit which makes us 
kindred with those in heaven, and 
causes us to feel we are renlly and 
truly brothers and sisters. 

I preside, act as a kind of bishop, over 
that portion of territory lying north of 
Virginia and east of Ohio. It includes 
about one-third of the population of 
the United States. There are a great 
many people there who have not yet 
learned I am their "bishop," and I ex- 
pect it will be a long while before they 
find it out. When I was first asked to 
preside over that district I felt the re- 
sponsibility, in that vast throng of 
God's children, to see that they were 
warned of the fact that the Gospel has 
been restored and that it is now being 
preached to the world as a witness.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one of the great thoroughfares of the 
city of New York, and watched the 
throngs of people passing (three hun- 
dred thousand every day), and when 
I realized that this was only one of 
many thoroughfares in that great city, 
and that city was only one of many in 
the district; and when I thought of the 
thousands of cultured, eloquent minis- 
ters in the district, it seemed impossible 
for a few western boys, many of whom, 
like myself, come from the sands, rocks, 
and the cactus fields of th e south, to 
make ourselves heard, or known in that 
great mass of humanity. When we first 
hired halls no one entered them, and 
when we tried to get into their homes 
and experienced their exclusiveness, I 
again thought how impossible the task 
would be. Had I not known that this 
work was from above, I would have 
given up in discouragement. One had 
to possess a sublime faith in God, 
knowing that it was His work, and that 
he could make possible what He had 
called him to accomplish. With this 
faith we turned our faces to the task, 
carrying on the good work that had 
been started by those who preceded us. 
I feel today I can say we have at least 
accomplished one part of our task. I 
believe that every soul in the district 
has heard that th e kingdom of God has 
been established, that God has spoken 
again from the heavens, that His ser- 
vants are traveling as they did ancient- 
ly, and that this Gospel is being 
preached a s a witness unto the people. 
God has done His part. Among other 
things He has used the powerful agency 
of the press. The press with its ten 
thousand tongues has sent this Gospel 
into the homes of the rich and proud 
as well as the poor and humble. And 
this, not because of our ability, but as 
a result of our faithfulness. Scarcely a 
week passes but there is something in 
the papers concerning the work in 
which we are engaged. Portraits of the 
Elders, views of their homes, the places 
where w e hold our meetings, and our 
articles of faith, ar e published so often 
that we cannot help but acknowledge 
that God is assisting u s to accomplish 
His purpose. This strengthens our 



faith, even as Nephi's faith was 
strengthened when he returned after 
accomplishing his mission, obtaining 
the plates of brass "that a nation 
should not dwindle in unbelief." I men- 
tion this to strengthen the faith of some 
who may feel unable to accomplish the 
task that God has assigned to them. 
While many things are said in op- 
position to us it is only bearing 
out the prophecy that the name of 
Joseph Smith should be known for good 
and for evil in all the nations of the 
earth. If you wanted to make your 
name known for good and evil in all 
the nations of the earth, how could you 
do it? Think of how few men have 
made their names known in all the 
earth, either for good or evil. The 
name of Jesus Christ has been eighteen 
hundred years reaching the limits, and 
yet today, nearly every one who has 
heard the name of Jesus Christ has also 
heard the name of Joseph Smith; and 
while they say many things that are 
evil concerning him there is generally 
something said that is good. 

During the last year we have had 
greater success in our district than ever 
before. We have succeeded in estab- 
lishing ourselves quite firmly. We hold 
Sunday schools and regular meetings 
in good halls and in good districts; and 
we have congregations in Boston 
Brooklyn, New York, Philadelphia, 
Baltimore, Albany, and Alleghany! 
Reporters come to our meetings and in- 
terview the elders, and when they com e 
in contact with them, and meet a 
pleasant congregation of representative 
People, they get a good impression of 
us, and this preaches the Gospel more 
effectually than we proclaim it. 
I remember when the greatest 
storm of abuse we ever ex- 
perienced broke over us, when 
there was a very bitter feeling, re- 
porters came to meet the elders' and 
they remarked that we looked like 
college graduates, that we had that 
clear look in our countenances which 
indicated virtuous living. We cannot 
help but show in our faces the Spirit 
of God if we keep His commandments. 
When we assume to be representatives

of the Church and kingdom of God. 
when we go out of private life and 
assume public life, something more is 
expected of us. When our boys and 
girls are called from the various avo- 
cations of life, and go into public life 
as missionaries of the gospel, they 
themselves seem to realize this fact. 
Tbey know they are expected to repre- 
sent the character of Latter-day-Saints. 
They know that their mothers, fathers, 
and friends are praying for their suc- 
cess. They know they are expected to 
reflect credit upon the Church. They 
feel that, in a way, they are representa- 
tives of Jesus Christ, and that they 
should reflect His character in their 
lives and His principles in their teach- 
ings. I believe the Latter-day-Saints 
can be justly proud of their boys and 
girls, so far as their conduct in the mis- 
sion field is concerned. When I hav-.; 
seen boys come into the mission fiela 
unsophisticated, perhaps uneducated, 
some who have never spoken in 
public places, some who never 
were called upon to defend their 
belief, but who possessed that 
living faith deep down in their hearts 
which, when the call for duty came, 
prompted them to respond to it, when 
I have seen this class of boys become 
in a very short time able defenders of 
the faith, and competent to meet any 
man in the world in support of the 
principles of the gospel, it has been to 
me a strong testimony of the truth- 
fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I have noticed, too, that members of 
the Church who are indifferent, and 
who visit us occasionally look with 
pride upon these Elders. If they should 
see an Elder with a cigar in his mouth, 
or entering a saloon, they would be 
indignant and say he should be re- 
called, they would assert he was not 
worthy to represent them, even though 
they did the same things themselves. 
Those who are neglectful in keeping 
the commandments themselves are 
often most severe in their censure of an 
Elder who makes a mistake. We have 
a right, my brethren and sisters, to 
expect this of our representatives. On 
the other hand, what has an Elder 



the right to expect ,from you who live 
in Zion? We are pointing people to 
Zion, we are telling them that it is 
established in the tops of the 
mountains that God's house and 
God's people are here, and when 
those people com e they expect 
to find Zion. We have a right to ask 
of every Latter-day Saint that he or 
she shall reflect the glory of the Gospel 
light, just as much as you have a right 
to expect it of your representatives in 
the world. Christ has a right to expect 
it from that "peculiar people," that 
"royal generation," that "holy priest- 
hood," which Peter spoke of. When we 
name His name we should keep His 
commandments. When saints gather 
up to Zion and they see those who, 
perhaps, were once Elders among them 
going into saloons, or other men who 
bear the holy priesthood breaking the 
commandments of God, what is the 
effect? You shatter their faith. I know 
that the blood moves quicker about 
our hearts when we sing of these 
snow-capped mountains, these fertile 
valleys, and of the crystal streams 
flowing down from the mountains and 
running off into a shimmering sea. It 
is a beautiful picture, my brothers and 
sisters; but snow-capped mountains, 
beautiful valleys, crystal streams, and 
shimmering seas, do not make Zion. 
Zion is where the pure in heart dwell, 
and if we are going to live worthy of 
the light we have received we must 
be pure in heart. If we live up to the 
light and knowledge we have received 
and reflect it in our lives in these 
mountains, I know that the Gospel can 
and will revolutionize the world. 

We feel encouraged in our mission- 
ary work, my brethren and sisters. 
Tour sons in the mission field are doing 
a glorious work, and they are meeting 
successfully all the opposition that is 
brought to bear against them. They 
do not flinch from the storms that 
arise; they do not fear when threats 
are made. I hope that everyone who is 
here, w.ill appreciate the power of the 
priesthood, knowing that this is God's 
work, and that none will feel to waver 
or falter. God bless you, my brothers

and sisters, and bless Zion, that she 
may grow and prosper, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Un'ty in prayer — Need of prayer under all c.rcum- 
stanci-s — Th • Lord's willingness to answer it — 
Operations of good ai d evil. 

Brethren and sisters, I wish that each 
of you could stand here and look into the 
sea of faces that are before me, and 
then you would have something of the 
feeling which I have in standing before 
so large a congregation of Latter-day 
Saints. I esteem it as a very great 
privilege; at the same time I feel the 
responsibility of occupying tne position 
of a teacher in the Church of Christ. 
I feel the need of your faith and pray- 
ers in my behalf, and of the Spirit of 
the Lord to enlighten my mind and to 
inspire my remarks, so that I shall be 
able to say something that will edify 
the Saints. I have been very much im- 
pressed with the spirit of the confer- 
ence, with the large gatherings in this 
building yesterday, as well as at the 
meeting in the Assembly Hall, the 
meeting at the Bureau of Information, 
and in addition the large number of 
people who were walking to and fro 
on this block. Zion is growing. It is 
going to be a very difficult matter to 
accommodate the Latter-day Saints in 
these conference gatherings. Neverthe- 
less, we shall have to do the best we 
can. We rejoice in the spirit of the 
work. 

One thing that has impressed me very 
much during the conference is the char- 
acter of our worship before the Lord. 
In the assemblies of the Latter-day 
Saints a very important feature is the 
calling upon the name of the Lord in 
prayer. The? words that are offered up 
in the invocation from this pulpit mean 
a great deal to the people. We must 
not suppose that when an Elder of Is- 
rael is called upon to pray, the words 
which he utters belong to him, or that 
the prayer is altogether his prayer. I 
do not so consider it. The prayer which 
is offered up ascends to heaven in be- 
half of the entire congregation. This is 
indicated by the response which fol- 



lows the prayer, when the people lift 
up their voices and say amen. That 
response makes the prayer general in 
its character and applicable to the 
whole Church. It is your prayer; it is 
the prayer of the Latter-day Saints. 
And when prayer is offered up in this 
manner I am simple enough to believe 
that it penetrates into the very heavens, 
and is heard by God our Father, and 
such prayers will surely be answered 
upon our heads. 

It is astonishing the amount of scrip- 
ture and revelation that has been given 
upon the subject of prayer, touching its 
importance, its far-reaching character, 
and its necessity to the children of men, 
especially to the children of God. I am 
reminded of a passage which occurs in 
a revelation given to Martin Harris in 
March, 1830. The Lord said unto him: 

"And again, I command thee that 
thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy 
heart; yea, before the world as well as 
in secret, in public as well as in pri- 
vate." 

"Pray always, and I will pour out my 
Spirit upon you, and great shall be 
your blessing; yea, even more than if 
you should obtain treasures of earth 
and corruptibleness to the extent there- 
of." 

How impressive are those few simple 
words in regard to prayer! How far- 
reaching! They enter into a man's life 
and comprehend his whole existence, at 
least from the years of his accountabil- 
ity until he passes into the grave. He 
must pray under all circumstances. 
Prayer is not reserved for the Sabbath 
day or for any particular occasion. It 
is not only to be used at the general 
conferences of the Church, but the 
spirit of prayer must be in our hearts 
unceasingly. We must pray in our 
families; we must pray in secret; we 
must pray in our hearts. The spirit, of 
prayer must be with us when we retire 
at night and when we arise in the 
morning. It must be upon us when we 
leave our homes for our daily employ- 
ment; in the office; in the shop; 
in the field; in the mountains or 
in the valleys, or wherever we 
are. We are told in the words which 
I have quoted that if that spirit is upon 



ELDER RUDGBR CLAWSON. 



us the Lord will bless us, and the bless- 
ings which will come in answer to 
prayer will be of more importance to 
us than treasures of earth. "We know 
something of the treasures of earth; we 
realize the value and the desirability 
of earthly things. We know how they 
are sought after, and what great sacri- 
fices are made for them. But how much 
better it is to enjoy the full measure of 
the Spirit of God which is promised. 

Then we learn in another revelation, 
that was . given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith in 1832, something concerning the 
character of our heavenly Father. In 
that revelation He says to His Church 
through the Prophet: 

"Draw near unto me and I will draw 
near unto you: seek me diligently and 
and ye shall find me; ask and ye shall 
receive; knock and it shall be opened 
unto you; 

" Whatsoever ye ask the Father in 
my name it shall be given unto you, 
that is expedient for you; 

"And if ye ask anything that is not 
expeuient lor you, it shall turn unto 
your condemnation." 

Mark, brethren and sisters, how 
clear-cut are these words. There is no 
doubt, no dubiety. It does not say if 
and peradventure you call upon the 
Lord, He may be gone on a long jour- 
ney and you cannot reach Him; or He 
is very busy; His attention is now 
attracted to the nations of the earth; 
probably He is busily engaged with the 
great war between Russia and Japan 
and He cannot give you any attention, 
therefore you might as well cease pray- 
ing. No, this revelation does not give 
forth any such ideas. Our heavenly 
Father is always near and ready to 
listen to His children. "Draw near unto 
me and I will draw near unto you." 
It is not like we sometimes find it upon 
the earth with great men. Take the 
President of the United States, for 
instance. He is a great man, with very 
serious and grave responsibilities rest- 
ing upon him. His whole attention is 
devoted to the government and welfare 
of the people. The obligations resting 
upon him are perhaps almost more 
than he can carry. Consequently, when 
people call on him, many times he can- 
not receive them. He may be very 



43 

busily engaged upon his annual mes- 
sage, or upon some other matter, and 
those who go to see him may have to 
wait hours before they get access to 
him, or it is possible that they may 
have to trust their business to some 
representative of the President. How 
different with our Father in heaven, 
who has the responsibility of the world 
resting upon Him. His hand is upon the 
nations. He is directing in all the 
affairs of this world. He controls in 
all the kingdoms of the earth. He 
knows what is going on. He knows 
the status of this great war, and He 
knows just how it will all result. In 
other words, He will have it come out 
to further his purposes. He knows all 
about affairs in England, in France, in 
Germany, and those ten great king- 
doms spoken of by Daniel, the Prophet. 
I have no doubt He knows all that is 
going on in our own nation, and the 
great responsibility resting upon the 
people of the United States, the 
people of Canada, and the people 
of all the countries of America. 
And yet— think of it! He says to you 
and to me: He says to this poor man and 
to this poor woman: He says to this rich 
mar; and t° this rich woman: "Draw 
near unto Me and I will draw near unto 
you." Yes that poor widow down there, 
to whom nobody is paying any atten- 
tion, and who has very little influence, 
— to her the Lord says: "Draw near 
unto Me and I will draw near unto 
you." "My ear will be open to hear 
your prayer and to answer it." 
Did not the Savior notice the 
widow who cast her mite into the con- 
tribution box? She was poor; and 
all she had she threw into the 
box, and she , was left penni- 
less, and one might naturally say with- 
out a friend in the world. But she did 
have a friend, and that friend happened 
to be the Lord, than whom there is 
none greater. He stood there and said 
of that poor widow that of her poverty 
she had cast into the box more than all 
the others who had given of their 
wealth. Is not this a comfort and a con- 
solation? And this is what prayer 
brings — prayer that is offered in the 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



congregations of Israel, In the homes 
of the Latter-day Saints, and from the 
heart. Such prayer is effectual, and 
it reaches into the heavens. It has an 
influence there. 

To show the importance of prayer I 
remind you, my brethern and sisters, 
that in this world there are two great 
powers, and these two powers are at 
warfare. There is the power of good 
and the power of evil. They do not 
harmonize, they do not mix. Like oil 
and water, they will not mix. On the 
one hand, there is the power of good 
striving with every man and woman; 
on the other hand, there is the power 
of evil striving with every man and 
woman. Their prospects, their record, 
and all their future will depend upon 
which of these two greatpowers controls 
them. You can see this exemplified in 
what occured with Peter. The Lord 
said to him: 

"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath de- 
sired to have you, that he may sift 
you as wheat: 

"But I have prayed for thee, that thy 
faith fail not: and when thou art con- 
verted, strengthen thy brethern." 

What a wonderful saying was this! 
We would get the impression thai; the 
Savior had a perfect assurance that His 
prayer had been heard of the Father. 
Although Simon Peter was one of the 
chiefest of th e Apostles; like other men 
he had his weaknesses and his imper- 
fections, and I suppose the Lord knew 
wherein he was the weakest. He under- 
stood that Satan desired especially to 
sift Peter as wheat, and to destroy him 
if possible. Herein comes the power 
and virtue of prayer. The Lord Him- 
self prayed for him. He did not criti- 
cize or scold him, for He saw that he 
had weaknesses — as we all have, and 
I doubt not but Satan would like to 
have all of us that he might sift us; as 
wheat. I firmly believe that if it were 
not for the faith and prayers of this 
people, which are ascending continually 
to heaven, Satan certainly would have 
power over us, and perhaps in many 
instances we would be overcome and 
destroyed. The Lord prayed for Peter, 
and His prayer was heard, and so He 



charged Peter that when he was con- 
verted he should strengthen the breth- 
ren. We must bear in mind this great 
conflict that is going on between good 
and evil. ' Everything that is good, 
every power and principle that leads to 
good, is from God; and every influence 
that enticeth man to do evil is from 
Satan, the father of lies. Thus we may 
judge between the good and the evil. 

Before I sit down I want to call your 
attention to the power of prayer as it 
has been exemplified in the coming 
forth of the Book of Mormon, which is 
truly one of the most wonderful books 
ever published. The world might appre- 
ciate this book if they were not blinded 
by the subtle craftiness of man, and by 
the power of evil which lieth in wait 
to deceive. This book came forth by 
the power of God through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and I tell you that its 
coming forth was greatly influenced by 
prayer. It is so declared in one of the 
revelations of God given to the Prophet, 
found in section 10 of the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants. I will read it, be- 
cause it is so impressive, and shows 
clearly the efficacy of the prayers' which 
were offered by th e Nephites in regard 
to the coming forth of this book: 

"And, behold all the remainder of this 
work does contain all those parts of 
my gospel which my holy prophets, yea, 
and also my disciples, desired in their 
prayers should come forth unto this 
people. 

"And I said unto them, that it should 
be granted unto them according to their 
faith in their prayers; 

"Yea, and this was their faith that 
my gospel, which I gave unto them, 
that they might preach in their days, 
might come unto their brethren the 
Lamanites, and also all that had be- 
come Lamanites, because of their dis- 
sentions. 

"Now, this is not all— their faith in 
• heir prayers was, that this gospel 
should be made known also, if it were 
possible that other nations should pos- 
sess this land; 

"And thus they did leave a blessing 
upon this land in their prayers, that 
whosoever should believe in this gospel 
in this land, might have eternal life; 

"Yea, that it might be free unto all of 
whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or 
people they may be." 

From this it will be seen that the 



ELDER WM. 

coming forth of the Book of Mormon 
was influenced by and in fact was in 
answer to the prayers of the Nephites, 
offered up 14.00 years before and recorded 
in the celestial kingdom. In conclusion, 
I say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that your prayers and my prayers, if 
they are offered up in faith with single- 
ness to the glory of God, will be re- 
corded in the celestial kingdom, and 
the precious offerings and supplications 
that go up from these conferences will 
be recorded and will be answered upon 
the heads of this people, as God lives, 
if we will do our duty. May God bless 
you in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: "Come 
let us sing unto the Lord." Benediction 
was pronounced by Elder Collings 
Hakes. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

"Though deep'ning trials throng your 

way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God; 
Ere long the resurrection day 
Will spread its life and truth 
abroad." 

Prayer by Elder James E. Steele. 
Singing by the choir: 

"Awake, ye Saints of God, awake! 

Call on the Lord in mighty prayer, 
That he will Zion's bondage break, 

And bring to naught the fowler's 
snare." 

ELDER WILLIAM McLACHLAN, 
(President of Pioneer Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters: In standing 
before you this afternoon I desire, 
above all other blessings, that the Spirit 
of the Lord may direct the words I 
shall utter. Forty-one years ago I be- 
came identified with the Church of Je- 
sus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A few 
weeks later I received a testimony of 
the truth of this work. In tn e year 
1862, in answer to prayer, with a very 
earnest desire to gather to this land, 
the Lord spoke to me by the power of 
His Spirit, and gave unto me a promise 
that I should have the privilege of 
gathering according to my desire the 



McLACHLAN. 45 

following year. With that word came 
the most positive and definite assur- 
ance that was ever given to man. I 
could not doubt the word that the Lord 
gave to me on that occasion, and it 
was fulfilled to the very letter, although 
I had much trouble and difficulty in 
accomplishing my wish. From that 
time to the present I have been a resi- 
dent of Salt Lake City— that is, from 
October, 1863. I feel it is a great honor 
to be called to labor in any capacity in 
the work of the Lord. I realize very 
much my weakness and my inability 
to fill the call that has been made upon 
me, and the honor that has been be- 
stowed upon me by the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God. But 
I have been a worker, more or less, 
all my life, and my desire is to serve 
the Lord first, and then, if I am able, 
to serve the people with all the strength 
that God shall give me. I wish to devote 
my time, and the ability that God shall 
give me, under the inspiration of His 
Spirit, in laboring for the building up 
of this work and the spread of right- 
eousness and truth in the earth." The 
pugilists of the present day talk about 
heavy, light and feather-weights; I feel 
that I am a feather-weight. But 
the Lord is just as willing to hear and 
answer the petitions of the humble and 
incapable as those who are competent, 
and blessed with great talents and 
ability. I feel it is the privilage of every 
man and woman who has entered into 
covenant with God to be just as good as 
the best. There is nothing to prevent 
all from being good. The man who has 
the greatest ability is not always the 
best man; but the man who is humble, 
who is willing to acknowledge the hand 
of God, and who will seek His aid in 
accomplishing the work that has been 
assigned him, will be blessed and pros- 
pered in that labor. It is with this 
confidence in God my eternal Father 
that I have accepted this honor that 
has been conferred upon me, and by 
and through His help I shall try and 
do my duty. 

May the blessing and peace of Heav- 
en be upon the people of God. May 
the blessing of the Lord be upon their 



46

lands, upon their houses, and upon 
everything that pertains unto them, 
that we may become a united and a 
free people — free from sin and from 
stain of every kind, and live in har- 
mony and peace tog-ether before God. 
This is my prayer and desire in the 
name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER NEtPHI L. MORRIS. 
(President of Salt Lake Stake.) 

T most sincerely desire I may be 
g-uided and influenced by the Holy 
Spirit in the few remarks I shall make 
to you upon this occasion. Like Presi- 
dent McLaughlin, I feel very weak in 
this position to which I have just been 
called. I have endeavored during my 
life to discharge the duties which ware 
imposed upon me as a member of the 
Church of Christ, and I have learned 
that by humility and devotion to duty 
one may achieve somewhat of success. 
Without these qualities there is little 
hope of success. If my remarks are 
to be measured by my experience as a 
President of a Stake, they will be cer- 
tainly very brief, for I was only set 
apart to this new appointment a little 
over a week ago. My duties thus far 
have consisted in signing a half dozen 
recommends or so, and the attending of 
banquets, so that my experience 5 s 
very limited. I feel, however, to ac- 
cept, with meekness and with gratitude 
to God, the appointment which has 
been given me, and rely upon Him in 
the discharge of the duties pertaining 
to that calling. I am proud to be as- 
sociated with the Church of Christ, and 
to have the fellowship of such men as 
surround me upon this occasion. I am 
not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ; I am not ashamed of the mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ, and can 
look the world in the face and bear 
my testimony to the truthfulness of 
the work in which we are engaged. I 
know that we are a people called of God 
for a chosen purpose, to help uplift and 
save mankind. I know the world mis- 
understands us, and it is for our 
heavenly Father and ourselves to make 
our mission clear to the world. I know 
that we are maligned and misrepre- 
sented; but I have no fear of the lies 



of the world. They cannot hurt us. 
We are looked upon as being a fanat- 
ical lot of people — a people who have 
no high estimation of virtue, of honor, 
and of those qualities which go to 
make truly great disciples. But this is 
because the world do not understand 
the Latter-day Saints. It is lor us 
then, to make them understand us; 
and if they will but look upon us with- 
out prejudice they could not fail to ap- 
preciate the principles which animate 
our lives — the love of virtue and hon- 
or, and devotion to God. 

My most earnest prayer is that the 
Spirit of God may continue with His 
people, and that their lives may be 
characterized by unity, by devotion 
and sacrifice to him, and that he may 
qualify us by His Holy Spirit in the 
performance of all our duties, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD W. YOUNG. 
(President of Ensign Stake.) 

My dear brethren and sisters and 
friends: Of the fifty-odd Presidents of 
Stakes in this Church I am the very lat- 
est in point of ordination. I feel that I 
have not yet cut my teeth, and that I 
have not even learned how to talk. I 
have, however, in my mind some things 
which I think it would be fitting to 
mention, if the Spirit shall prompt me, 
and I pray that I may have it during 
the few minutes that I shall occupy 
your time. Like Brother Morris, and 
like practically all under the sound of 
my voice, I am proud to be numbered 
among the Latter-day Saints. I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, and 
the man does not live who is able to 
say that on any occasion whatever I 
have not been willing and, if the occa- 
sion were proper, anxious to declare my 
belief in the principles of what is called 
"Mormonism." I esteem it an honor to 
be associated with this people, despised 
and misunderstood though they are. I 
know their work, their faith, the sacri- 
fices they have made, their honesty, 
their virtue, their aspirations and their 
hopes, and, as I say, I feel it an honor 
to have a standing in this Church and 
to be associated with this people. It is 
no new thing for the people of God to 



ELDER ELIAS 

be despised, to be despitefully used, and 
to be evilly and falsely spoken of. That 
has been the common lot of the people 
of God in all ages. If we are thought to 
be unpatriotic, we have but to turn 
back to the first few centuries after the 
time of Christ to behold a people who 
were persecuted by reason of their al- 
leged lack of patriotism, and by reason 
•of the accusation that they indulged in 
treasonable practices. It is reasonable 
I take it, that the churches of the 
world should have little sympathy with 
this church. We have come forward 
with a message that this is the Church 
of God, and that by other professing 
Christian churches the ordinances have 
been broken, and they have strayed 
from the true path. Naturally this 
arouses within them a feeling of indig- 
nation, and for my part I have some- 
thing of sympathy for tnose not of our 
faith in their opposition to this Church, 
but nothing of sympathy with their de- 
sires to trample upon right and justice 
and constitutional principles in their 
treatment of us. I believe with all my 
heart that this is the Church of God. I 
desire to be a humble and obedient 
member of that Church. I desire to fill 
the position to which I have been ap- 
pointed — unworthily I believe — under 
the influence and power of the Spirit of 
•God. It is my desire to be useful among 
this people, according to the capacity 
which the Almighty has given me, and 
to that end I pray for the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints, particularly within 
my own Stake. I pray God that He 
may bless this people, that they may 
appreciate their responsibilities and 
their duties. Our professions are high, 
and our conduct should be equally high. 
It is not sufficient that we should be 
contented with knowing that we have 
the truth; we should not stop short of 
living according to the principles of 
truth that we have received. We may 
look among the Christian churches of 
today and we will find many noble ex- 
amples of Christian fortitude and sac- 
rifice, which we might very well emu- 
late as Latter-day Saints. Again I pray 
that God will bless this people, that 
they may arise to the fulness of their

privileges and their duties, and I pray 
this in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. KIMBALL. 
(President of Blackfoot Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters: I am pleas- 
ed with the opportunity of reporting 
the Blackfoot Stake of Zion. I desire 
to enjoy the Spirit of the Lord in the 
few remarks I shall offer. I am in- 
terested in the work to which I have 
been called. I look forth with hope 
and aspiration to be able, as a serv- 
ant of God, to do something, to make 
a good account of my stewardship, and 
not to be a disappointment to God and 
to His servants whom He has placed 
at the head of this Church. I will take 
advantage of this opportunity to bear 
testimony concerning the brethren who 
stand at the head of this Church. I 
have perfect confidence in the 
integrity and honor ' of the lead- 
ers of our Church. I lift up 
my voice in protest against every 
declaration of disrespect concerning 
them, and, so far as my influence and 
power goes, to stay such declarations. 
1 protest against them. I have been 
brought in contact with President 
Jcseph F. Smith and his counselors, 
and a number of the Twelve Apostles, 
and I am proud of the honor of their 
acquaintance, and can testify to their 
virtues and integrity. I tell you, re- 
gardless of statements which are made 
inside and outside of the Church, those 
men are interested in the welfare of 
all people, and are laboring incessantly 
for their welfare and upbuilding. This 
is my humble testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, and that is the 
reason I have for saying at this time 
I believe in them, and extend to them 
my faith and prayers, and I will give 
them my support with the help of God. 
I believe in this Church also. I know it 
is the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and I am willing to 
make any reasonable sacrifice, and I 
pray that I may be willling to make the 
sacrifice of my life, if called upon, for 
the building up> of the Church and 
kingdom of God in these latter days. 
If I understand the position cor- 



4S 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



rectly, this is a covenant that every 
man and woman in the Church has en- 
tered into. Therefore it behooves us 
to be upon our guard and cease evil 
speaking. I believe the people of 
Blackfoot Stake will compare fa- 
vorably with the Saints in any 
other part of G-od's vineyard, 
but I hav3 heard some things that 
have not been pleasing to me respect- 
ing the subject I have just mentioned. 
It is a principle that has been known 
by our people ever since the organiza- 
tion of this) Church, that those who lift 
up their voices against the Lord's an- 
ointed will not be blessed. It is some- 
thing that our people should become 
better acquainted with. In reading the 
other day about the Japanese, I learned 
that they are recognized asi the most 
loyal people of any nation. They love 
their Emperor, they love their coun- 
try, and that is their religion. I do 
not think the Japanese should be one 
whit ahead of the Latter-day Saints 
in loyalty. We should reverei and hon- 
or those whom God has placed at our 
head. We should give them our faith 
and prayers. We should not only love 
them, but we should love our God, our 
Church and our country. That is my 
religion, and I pray that I may have it 
burned into my heart and brain so 
that I may never forget it as long as I 
live. 

I feel well in the gospel. I know that 
it has made me what I am, if I am 
anything. I know it will make me 
what I hope to become, through a 
faithful, honest, virtuous life. It is 
worth to me more than all the riches 
of the world, and with the Lord's help 
I hope to be willing to sacrifice all for 
it. 

It is about two months since I was 
called to preside over the Blackf^t 
Stake of Zion. It came hard upon 
me because I was required to break up 
my home and go to a new country. 
You who have not passed through that 
experience will hardly understand my 
feelings, but you who have been called 
to fill missions to the nations of the 
earth, and to make sacrifices in that 
line, will appreciate some of my feel- 



ings. I went into that country and 
looked over the situation, and, to t^ll 
the truth, I was a sick man for about 
ten days and until after I met with the 
people. Subsequently I felt to glorify 
God that I had been called from where 
I lived to a new country, where I 
might grow up with the people, and 
help them to develop one of the best, 
sections in God's vineyard. 

Now I will tell you a little about the 
country. I invite all our brethern and 
sisters who are without homes, and who 
expect in the future to seek homes in 
a new country, to come to the Black- 
foot Stake. On the west side of the 
river from Blackfoot, there are over 
one hundred thousand acres of as good 
land as lies out of doors. From Ba- 
salt, on the north, down tne river to 
Thomas, in the southwest part of the- 
stake is a distance of twenty-five miles. 
It has an average width of from six to 
seven miles, and every foot of that land 
is arable and can be covered with wa- 
ter. Running through this section of 
the country are eight canals, which, 
when completed will hold a hundred 
and forty-two inches of water — more 
water than you have in Salt Lake val- 
ley. On the east side of the river there 
is a great extent of territory, which is 
covered with large canals taken from 
the Snake river. The country is only 
partly inhabited. There are many men 
in that section owning from six huadred 
and forty to three thousand acres each. 
They all love the almighty dollar 
enough to be willing to sell some of 
their lands. I regret to state, however, 
there is an excitement at the present 
time in our community. Eastern capi- 
talists have thought it advisable and 
profitable to build a sugar factory near 
Blackfoot City, and the people have 
been thrown into an excitement on this 
account, as they were in Salt Lake 
City when the "boom" was on, and they 
are asking two or three times the price 
for their land that they were willing 
to take a month ago. I hope and anti- 
cipate that this spirit will disappear, 
and that the people will become more 
reasonable in their prices. In looking 



ELDER ELIAS S. KIMBALL. 



49 



over that country I estimate it is capa- 
ble of sustaining from forty to fifty 
thousand people, if it be cut up into 
smaller farms. I have never seen bet- 
ter soil; it is as good as you will find 
in any part of the Snake River valley, 
and in my opinion that is the greatest 
valley in the Rocky mountains. You 
who are unacquainted with the size of 
Snake river, and the Snake River val- 
ley, have a very slight conception of 
what there is to the north of you. I 
believe that every one claiming the 
name of Later-day Saint could go into 
the Snake River valley and become 
comfortably situated upon farms, it is 
so large. The Blackfoot district is an 
excellent farming and fruit district. 
While I do not wish to discourage our 
brethren who live up the valley (for 
they are living in one of God's finest 
countries), I believe I have many reasons 
to offer why the Blackfoot section of 
the Snake River valley is better to live 
in than it is farther up. It is claimed 
by the citizens who have lived in that 
section of the country for a long time 
that the open seasons there ar e between 
two and four weeks longer than they 
are further up the valley. The altitude 
of Blackfoot is about the same as Salt 
Lake City— four thousand five hundred 
feet— but it is considerably colder than 
Salt Lake City on account of the winds 
which prevail there. I have faith, how- 
ever, in God's willingness and power to 
help His people if they will keep His 
commandments, and though these cold 
winds are disagreeable I think He will 
do as much for the people of Snake 
River valley in causing the winds to 
abate, and the climate to become more 
pleasant, as He did for the people of 
Bear Lake valley. My brother 
Golden and I used to live in 
Bear Lake valley; we ranched there for 
fourteen years, and we became inured 
to the windstorms which occurred con- 
tinuously through the winter in that 
country. President Budge, of the Bear 
Lake stake, informs me that now it is 
a rare thing to have a severe wind 
storm, and the climate has become 
moderated and more desirable for the 



people. I have faith that this will occur 
in the Snake River country. People 
who live here have been educated to 
believe it is an undesirable country, 
with a cold, rigorous climate; I 
hope the time will come when you will 
get a correct idea regarding that sec- 
tion, and that some of you will come 
there and settle. There are thousands 
of young people in these older settled 
communities who would be greatly 
blessed if they would pick up their 
knapsacks and come out into the Snake 
River valley. I realize it is not the 
desire of our brethern that these older 
settlements shall become depopulated; 
but there are hundreds of young men 
who, if they stay in these older com- 
munities, will have small opportunity 
of ever becoming anything particular 
or gathering around them this world's 
goods. They have natural ability and 
intelligence, and they should go into a 
new country, grow up with it, and be- 
come prominent in the community. 

I pray the Eternal Father that He 
will bless the Saints of God, and in- 
spire us all to be faithful, true to 
our covenants, pure, and to abstain 
from everything that is reckless or un- 
wise. I pray that we may become 
more loyal to God and to His servants. 
I feel highly honored, my brethren and 
sisters, in being a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and in associating with you as 
such. I feel highly honored in being 
called to preside over the Blackfoot 
Stake of Zion, and with the Lord's help, 
and the help of my brethren and sis- 
ters who live there, we will accom- 
plish something in the development of 
that country. I have two counselors 
who are strenuous young men, who 
have faith in the future, who believe in 
God, and who have love and confidence 
in His servants; and we are united. We 
have a desire to build up that coun- 
try, that our people will have some- 
thing to be proud of. May God bless 
us to this end, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



Encouraging reference to rhe young people— Testi- 
mony of the Go-p-l-The believer and obedient 
will be saved— The wick d cinnot place the 
cause of their sins upon others 

Relying upon the Spirit of the Lord, 
and also depending upon your assist- 
ance, I trust that whatsoever may be 
said by me this afternoon will be in 
harmony with the truth, as the truth 
has been spoken at each session of this 
Conference. I rejoice in the words 
that have been uttered, and in the tes- 
timonies that have been borne, by the 
servants of the Lord. These testimonies 
do much toward bringing joy to my 
soul; for, like the brethren who have 
spoken, I, too, have a testimony of the 
divinity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and, like Brothers Morris and Young, 
I can say that I am not ashamed of 
the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power 
of God unto salvation to every one that 
believeth. These brethren are young 
men; I also am a young man, and in 
repeating that declaration, made by 
the Apostle Paul in an epistle to the 
Roman Saints, I but echo the senti- 
ments of tens of thousands of young 
men who are members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I am proud to feel that I am a repre- 
sentative young man among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. If there is the slightest 
Idea in the minds of any of the Latter- 
day Saints that the young men are not 
following in the footsteps of their pa- 
rents, and are not gaining a testimony 
for themselves, those who entertain 
such an idea are not acquainted very 
extensively with the young men of 
Zion. Because one young man is wild, 
and perhaps sinful and rebellious, or 
because two or three may be in this 
condition, is no valid reason why any 
Latter-day Saint should imagine that 
all of the young men of the Church 
are rebellious and sinful. A young 
man may have a s great a testimony of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ as may an 
old man. In evidence of this we need 
but point to the thousands of young 
men and women f the Church who bear 
testimony that they know the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ is true, and that it is 



the power of God unto salvation. The 
Lord Jesus knew this when He was 
'twelve years of age. He knew that His 
mission was to do that which His 
Father had sent Him into the world to 
fulfill. Long before that, Samuel, an- 
other child, knew it. Long after, Jo- 
seph Smith, another child knew it. And 
in the intermediate stages of these 
times there have been thousands of 
young men who knew that God lived, 
and that Jesus is the Christ. We, as 
young people, are entitled to this knowl- 
edge, for the Lord will not withhold 
any blessing, any knowledge, any intel- 
ligence from a man simply be- 
cause he is young. Ashamed of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ? I have won- 
dered why Paul ever made such a re- 
mark. He was a man who had been 
converted by a miraculous light from 
heaven, and the voice of Christ speak- 
ing to him demanding why he persecut- 
ed the Lord, and from that time on he 
was a preacher of righteousness, a min- 
ister of the Gospel, a missionary to 
the rsations of the earth, declaring 
Christ and Him crucified. Why, then, 
should Paul say, "For I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ?" I 
suppose it was because the members 
of the Church of Christ in those days 
were despised, hated, persecuted, and 
put to death for. the bearing of such a 
testimony; and no doubt there were 
those who were weak in the faith, and 
who had no relish for persecution or 
for death. These Saints to whom 
Paul wrote, living as they did at Rome, 
among the Romans, were subject to 
all these afflictions, and in order to en- 
courage them, and to point out that 
the Gospel was above all, and was 
better than life itself— in fact, that the 
Gospel was life itself, and that there- 
fore they need not fear nor be ashamed 
of it— he, their shepherd, their mission- 
ary, he who had done much .to con- 
vert them, desired them to know that 
he was not ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, because he knew that it was 
the power of God unto salvation to eve- 
ry one that believed it; "to the Jew 
first, and also to the Greek." In our 
day there are many men — more than 



ELDER HYR 

there were in that day — who have this 
same testimony, and the same un- 
daunted courage to say to the Saints 
that they are not ashamed of the Gos- 
pel of Christ. Furthermore, they have 
the courage to stand among the nations 
and declare the same truth to them. 

Why should we be ashamed of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ? Are we 
ashamed of the Redeemer of the world, 
who suffered as we will never be able 
or expected to suffer, for the truth? 
Ashamed of the truth? ashamed of up- 
rightness? ashamed of honesty? of in- 
tegrity? of obedience to God and to 
righteous laws? ashamed of all that is 
good and true? Why indeed should a 
man be ashamed of these things? And 
no man with the courage of his convic- 
tions and with this knowledge in his 
heart will ever deny this truth to es- 
cape the persecution, the hatred, the 
contempt, and the revilings of 
the world. No; we follow our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the 
great Shepherd, who has declared, "For 
whosoever shall be ashamed of me and 
of my words, of him shall the Son of 
man be ashamed, when he shall come 
in his own glory, and in his Father's, 
and of the holy angels." He has said 
further, "Whosoever therefore shall 
confess me before men, him will I con- 
fess also before my Father which is in 
heaven. But whosoever shall deny me 
before men, him will I also deny before 
my Father, which is in heaven." Who 
among the Latter-day Saints, entitled 
to all privileges of the knowledge of 
the Gospel of Christ for himself, will 
deny Jesus Christ, and by so doing 
place himself in a position to be denied 
of the Savior before God the eternal 
Father? Not the young men of the 
Latter-day Saints, let me assure you; 
and let me assure the world, too, that 
it will not be the young men of this 
Church who will deny Jesus Christ, and 
with even greater assurance can I say 
that it will not be the old men. It will 
not be any Latter-day Saint who has 
the knowledge of the truth and in 
whose bosom burns the testimony 
thereof revealed from Almighty God, in 
spite of every effort put forth by the 



M M. SMITH. 51 

adversary and his emissaries to per- 
suade or to enforce us to do so. I am 
proud myself to feel that I have been 
permitted to be born in the light of 
truth, and to walk in the path marked 
out by Christ and well followed by the 
servants of God. As my brethren have 
said, I am only too proud to be per- 
mitted to be numbered with the Latter- 
day Saints. 

The Gospel of Christ is the power of 
God unto salvation unto all those who 
believe it; but it is not the power of 
salvation to any man who does not be- 
lieve it. Notwithstanding Jesus Christ 
is the Son of God; notwithstanding 
he was appointed and ordained before 
the foundations of the world were laid 
to perform the work which He accom- 
plished; notwithstanding He came in 
the meridian of time by the appointment 
of the Father; notwithstanding He 
preached the Gospel, the plan of life 
and salvation, by which all men may 
be saved; notwithstanding the miracles 
He performed; notwithstanding that 
ultimately His kingdom will triumph, 
and all enemies be put under His feet, 
and He will reign as Lord of lords and 
King of kings; notwithstanding He was 
crucified for the sins of the world and 
His blood was shed for the redemption 
of mankind; notwithstanding all this, 
no man on the earth will ever be saved 
by the Gospel unless he believes it. A 
man will never be saved in unbelief. 
The Gospel is not the power of God un- 
to salvation to the unbeliever, but it is 
destined to save all who believe and 
obey it. You Latter-day Saints who be- 
lieve, if you continue in the way of 
righteousness, shall be redeemed by the 
blood of Christ and saved and exalted 
with Him on the right hand of the Fa- 
ther, just as sure as He lives. The pur- 
pose of the Gospel is to save us from 
our sins and our weaknesses, through 
repentance. How often do the Saints 
pray, "O Father, forgive our sins; over- 
look our weaknesses, our shortcomings, 
and our imperfections. " The Lord has 
given the Gospel for that very purpose. 
It is the mission of the Gospel to save 
us from these sins. 

In the time of Moses the Lord gave 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



commandments to Israel, in which He 
told them they were to worship the 
Lord God, and none else. They were not 
to make unto themselves any other 
gods, nor bow down to the likenesses of 
anything- in the heavens or in the earth; 
hut Him only were they to worship; 
for, said He, "I the Lord thy 
God am a jealous God, visiting 
the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children unto the third and 
fourth generation of them that hate me, 
and shewing mercy unto thousands of 
them that love me and keep my com- 
mandments." The Jews believed in the 
law of heredity to a great extent, prob- 
ably to a greater extent than they were 
justified; and by and by they took this 
commandment and crystalized it into a 
proverb which declared, "The fathers 
have eaten sour grapes, and the chil- 
dren's teeth are set on edge." Then 
when rebuked for their sins and their 
abominations, they would turn and 
say, in effect, "Well, we are not to 
blame. It's not our fault. It is the 
sins of the fathers being visited upon 
the heads of the children, and surely 
God will not condemn us for the sins 
which we have inherited from our fath- 
ers, for our teeth have been set on edge 
by our fathers eating sour grapes." The 
Lord was very much displeased with 
this excuse of theirs, and He declared 
to Ezekiel, the prophet, "As I live, saith 
the Lord God, ye shall not have occa- 
sion any more to use this proverb in 
Israel." He then went on to tell the 
people through the prophet that He 
would require of every man and every 
woman in Israel an accounting for his 
or her own conduct and course in life, 
and every one should be judg- 
ed according to the deeds done 
in the body. These Israelites seemed to 
forget that part of the commandment 
which said, that He would show mercy 
unto thousands of them that loved Him 
and kept His commandments. 

Even in our day there is a disposition 
on the part of some to say, "Well, my 
father was addicted to strong drink;" 
"my father was given to profanity;" 
"in my father's family was found con- 
sumption, epilepsy, and other terrible 



diseases which are handed down from 
father to son," and offer that as an ex- 
cuse for their own bad habits. We also 
hear it said frequently concerning the 
son of a man, 'Well, you can't expect 
anything else; look at his father." Or, 
speaking of a daughter, "what can you 
expect from her when you know her 
mother?" And so it goes; we condone 
some of the sins and the weaknesses of 
the flesh on the ground that they are 
inherited. He who feels that his par- 
ents are responsible for his inherent 
weaknesses and evil propensities, and 
thereby justifies himself, accuses his 
father of iniquity, and classes himself 
among the generations of those who 
hate the Lord. I should not like to be 
in this condition. Such a one ought 
to believe in and apply the saving prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
which will save him from his sins and 
redeem him from error, and by means 
of this Gospel raise himself 
above all the sins and evil practices 
of his progenitors. This is what the 
Gospel will do. There is no law of her- 
edity that is greater than the redeem- 
ing power and regenerating influences 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. And it 
is intended to save the body as well 
as the spirit. If properly lived, there is 
no sin, no inherited evil — I care not 
what it is — that the power of God can- 
not relieve and eliminate from the soul 
of man. It can redeem us from the er- 
rors and evils of mortality, and raise 
us without sin unto salvation into the 
presence of Almighty God. Therefore, 
no Latter-day Saint is justified in con- 
tinuing in weaknesses and in imperfec- 
tions. All of us have them, nevertheless. 
The Lord knew that when He gave the 
Gospel. The Gospel was given for the 
purpose of relieving us of them. Sin 
came into the world through the fall of 
man, and sin shall be banished from the 
world by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. If 
we would be raised up and redeemed 
from the fall, let us apply the redeem- 
ing and saving principles of the Gospel 
to our own lives, for so long as we con- 
tinue in sin and are plagued with the 
weaknesses and evils of the flesh, just 
so far are we from that stage where 



ELDER A. 

we can properly apply the Gospel or 
that part of it which will particularly 
fit our condition and save us from our 
evil tendencies. 

Ashamed of such a power and such a 
plan? Ashamed of those who preach it? 
Ashamed of those who practice these 
principles, and who thereby have risen 
to a stage beyond and above their fel- 
lowmen who, perhaps, may regard them 
with contempt? I say the Latter-day 
Saints are not the people who will be 
ashamed of this power of God unto sal- 
vation. We will continue to believe and 
to practice the Gospel; we will continue 
to be obedient and to serve God; we 
will continue to love our neighbor as 
ourselves, to return good for evil; to 
give a blessing for a cursing; we 
will continue in the straight and nar- 
row path which leadeth unto eternal 
life, in spite of all that the adversary 
of the souls of men can do. Brothers 
and sisters, your sons and your daugh- 
ters will do this. As young people we 
rejoice that it is our privilege to fol- 
low those who are older, who are wis- 
er and more intelligent, and who can set 
a good example. Thank God that we 
have such men to follow. I ask you 
young men and you young women of 
the Church, where in all the world 
among the leaders of men, in the state 
or in the Church, can you find more no- 
ble examples of righteous, just, God- 
fearing, self-sacrificing lives, than you 
find in the lives of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and his successors? Every 
young man ought to be proud and 
thankful to Almighty God that he is 
permitted to follow such men. That is 
my feeling, brethren and sisters, at the 
present time, and I pray that it will be 
forever. I know it will be so with the 
Latter-day Saints forever if they con- 
tinue in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
which is the power of God unto salva- 
tion unto all who believe. God bless 
you in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER A. W. IVINS. 
(President of Juarez Stake.) 

I esteem it a great privilege and 
. blessing, my brethren and sisters, to 
have the opportunity of meeting with 



W. IVINS. 53 

you in Conference upon this seventy- 
fourth anniversary of the organization 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Looking backward, and 
contemplating the history of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints from the organization 
of the Church until today, I rejoice with 
you that the "marvelous work and won- 
der," which was inaugurated with the 
restoration of the Gospel in tne dispen- 
sation in which we live, has been so re- 
markably developed, under God's provi- 
dence and blessing. The fact of our 
being here, the great extension of this 
work, the representatives who are here 
from more that fifty organized stakes 
of Zion, are all witnesses to us that the 
Lord has fulfilled thus far every prom- 
ise made to His people. Contemplating 
these things, I know of no example 
where the blessings of God to His peo- 
ple, His provident hand, His mercy and 
kindness, have been more directly man- 
ifest than in His hand-dealings with 
your brethren and sisters who are es- 
tablished in the Republic of Mexico. We 
are not in a desirable country, as men 
understand country to be desirable. 
Mexico is a land of barren, treeless 
wastes, a land of dry rivers, of rugged, 
impenetrable mountains — a desert land, 
if there is one occupied by the Saints 
upon this continent. Notwithstanding 
that, the few Latter-day Saints who are 
there (they now number thirty-seven 
hundred souls) have accomplished a 
most remarkable work. We have had 
no pecuniary assistance at all from th e 
government in which we live. They 
have never constructed a rod of road or 
built a bridge. Notwithstanding this 
fact, however, hundreds of miles of 
wagon road have been constructed and 
many bridges have been built; eight 
prosperous colonies have been estab- 
lished, orchards are loaded with fruit; 
gardens are filled with flowers; comfort- 
able and in many instances, almost 
luxurious homes have been built — and 
all this done by a people in their pover- 
ty, who went there without resources, 
depending solely upon the as- 
sitance of God and their own 
efforts. And they hardly knew 
why they went there. They knew 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they were going into the land of the La- 
manites; they knew they were going- to 
a government whose president, whose 
ministry, whose army, and whose navy 
(so far as they have one) were made 
up of people who were direct descend- 
ants of Father Lehi; and they believed 
that in the providence of God He had a 
mission for them to perform there. 
Time has passed, conditions have de- 
veloped, and today we see the wisdom 
of the Almighty in placing a few of His 
people away off in that southern coun- 
try, where the Gospel can be introduced 
to this remnant of the house of Israel. 
The people have established as good a 
school system as exists in the Church. 
Free schools are maintained in every 
one of the colonies, and we have never 
received a dollar of help from the gov- 
ernment. It has all been done by the 
free-will offerings of the Latter-day 
Saints. We have as good a stake acad- 
emy, so far as our courses extend, as 
any in the Church, which is maintained 
largely by the voluntary contributions 
of the people. Since I was installed by 
President Lyman as President of the 
Juarez Stake of Zion, eight years ago, 
the population of the Stake has increas- 
ed seventy-five per cent. During the 
same period the tithes of the people 
have increased three hundred and twen- 
ty-five per cent. Our relations with 
the Mexican government are exceeding- 
ly satisfactory. We keep entirely out 
of politics; we mind our own business, 
and are left in peace— thank heaven for 
that! We cannot offer homes to our 
brethren and sisters, notwithstanding 
the fact that we would be very much 
pleased indeed to have additions to the 
colonies, because of the very limited 
resources we have. That is to say, we 
cannot offer inducements of a financial 
character; but I do believe that the mor- 
al atmosphere of our colonies compen- 
sates us to a very great degree for the 
lack of this world's goods which we so 
much feel. During the eight years I 
have been in Mexico I have never heard 
the name of Deity profaned by a Lat- 
ter-day Saint, I have never seen a 
member of the Church with a cigarette 
in his mouth, and I have never seen a 



member of the Church under the in- 
fluence of liquor. There may have been 
isolated cases, but they have never come 
under my observation. I do not say 
this boastingly, for there are many re- 
forms that we can yet make to advan- 
tage, and whatever we have been able 
to accomplish, God alone has the credit 
for it, since we have depended entirely 
upon Him. 

As I came to Conference this morn- 
ing two men sat on the seat immedi- 
ately behind me in the street car. One 
of them was an old man and a member 
of the Church of Christ. The other 
was was a younger man, whose accent 
clearly indicated his foreign birth, and 
whose features showed him to be a 
native of northern Europe. He was a 
man, I detected in a moment, of more 
than ordinary intelligence. Speaking 
to the old gentleman, he said: 'What 
do you people come up here to Con- 
ference for twice a year?" The reply 
was: "We come up to be taught the 
word of the Lord." "The word of the 
Lord! You profess to be the Church 
of Christ; do you make any converts 
around here?" "Well, I don't know 
that we do." "Of course you don't, 
because your doctrine is a delusion. 
You profess to be the Church of Christ, 
when in reality this is a man-made 
Church of yours, and Christ has noth- 
ing to do with it. Thank God I found 
this difference." "Why! you cannot be 
very well acquainted with the history 
and doctrines of our Church." "Oh 
yes, I am, I know all about it; I have 
been here for twelve years." I thought 
to myself, if this is man-made religion 
which we teach, where under heaven 
would you find a religion from God, 
our eternal Father? And my mind re- 
verted back to prominent incidents as- 
sociated with the establishment of this 
work. At that time how little the 
world knew of God; how little they 
knew the manner in which religion, or 
anything else in fact, might come from 
Him! How vague was the conception 
of the Prophet Joseph himself concern- 
ing the great plan of redemption when 
he prayed to God the eternal 
Father to give him light, and 



ELDER A. W| IVINS. 



then came that remarkable vision. 
God Himself revealed His own person- 
ality and the personality of His Son, 
the Reedeemer of the world! And with 
the closing of that vision there stood 
upon the earth another witness for God 
competent to declare that He was in 
the form of man. What a revelation to 
those people who had been worshiping 
they knew not what and calling- it God! 
True, Joseph Smith stood alone in this 
testimony; but that testimony, corrob- 
orated by the written word of God in 
the Bible, still stands unimpeached be- 
fore the world, and it is stronger, bet- 
ter evidence of the personality of our 
Father in heaven, and that Christ, His 
Son, lives and speaks to the inhabitants 
of the earth, than a negative assertion 
by all the world who simply doubt be- 
cause they have not seen. Then came 
Moroni with the record contained in the 
Book of Mormon, lifting the veil from 
off this great continent of ours, and giv- 
ing to us the key by which the myster- 
ies of these great ruins in Mexico, Cen- 
tral America and Northern South 
America (many of which I have seen 
myself) may be unlocked, and by which 
the hand-dealings of God with the 
mighty peoples who have occupied the 
American continent are known. And 
more than that, it gave us the Gospel 
of Christ in its simplicity and purity, 
as He Himself taught it to the Nephite 
nation. Then came John the Baptist 
restoring the Aaronic Priesthood; then 
Peter, James and John, restoring the 
Melchisedek Priesthood. How consist- 
ent, how orderly it all is — the time, the 
place, the messengers, the message! 
Do you believe for a moment that Jo- 
seph Smith had wisdom to devise such 
a plan and introduce it under such cir- 
cumstances? This man in the street 
car said that Joseph Smith and Brig- 
ham Young have a terrible debt to pay 
for leading these thousands of people 
into delusion and entangling them in 
the meshes of this net they have 
thrown around them. Through the res- 
toration of the Melchisedek Priesthood 
by the Apostles, the Holy Ghost came 
to the world, which testifies to you and 
to me that the record which Joseph 



55 

the Prophet bore concerning the ap- 
pearance of God the Father and His 
Son Jesus Christ, is true. The confer- 
ring of the Aaronic Priesthood by John 
the Baptist restored the Gospel of re- 
pentance; and, thank heaven, he told 
us that Priesthood should never be tak- 
en from the earth again — an assurance 
that has not been given to any 
other people that have ever lived. 
Have not we seen that promise vindi- 
cated up to the present time? The 
Church is fifty thousand times stronger 
than it was seventy-four years ago, 
as to membership. Is it fifty thous- 
and times stronger m faith? Yes, I say 
it is; for we understand the gospel 
better. By application we have learn- 
ed it better. Excommunications from 
the Church are far less in proportion 
to numbers. There are not so many 
falling away. Consequently, I say the 
faith of the people has increased pro- 
portionately with, membership. And 
this work will continue to grow strong- 
er and stronger and greater and great- 
er until it does what God has said it 
would do — regenerates this earth; 
teaches men a better life; makes them 
more moral, more honest, more virtu- 
ous, more God-fearing, more patriotic, 
and more capable of administering gov- 
ernment, whether it be civil or ec- 
clesiastical, in justice among men and 
in righteousness before God. That is 
what the gospel is going to do. 

Why is the world. afraid of it? What 
is there in it to fear? Is it treason to 
say that we believe in God? That we 
believe this nation of ours (for which 
we thank Him!) exists under His di- 
vine protection and care, and that He 
has established it and maintained it? 
God inspired Washington and the pa- 
triot fathers of this country and helped 
them fight their battles in the revolu- 
tion. He sent Lafayette, Rochambeau 
and De Kalb to assist them. He 
strengthened the hands of the Federal 
army in the war of the rebellion, be- 
cause the integrity of the union was 
to be maintained. He has preserved 
and lifted the people of this land above 
all nations, that they may be a light 
unto the world, an arbiter of nations, 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and an example of justice and righte- 
ousness to all. And He will maintain 
them in that just as long- as they fear 
and believe in Him. Is it treason to 
say that men owe allegiance to God, 
and that governments owe allegiance 
to God? Does it show lack of patriot- 
ism to say to this great nation of ours, 
that this is a land choice above all 
other lands, and that the inevitable de- 
cree has gone forth from God, and 
it hangs over this nation today just 
as it has over every nation that ever 
occupied the American continent, that 
the people, or nation, which occupy 
this land, must serve God and ac- 
knowledge Him? "We say that, and 
we want the world to understand it, 



as we do every doctrine of this gospel. 
There is nothing covered about it. We 
welcome investigation. Every prin- 
ciple, every doctrine, the organization 
of the Church, the union of the people, 
God help us to keep them all intact. I 
testify to' you that this is the work of 
God; that it is inspired of God today 
through its leaders as much as it ever 
was. God help us to keep our cov- 
enants with Him, and to wait patiently 
and see His salvation. I ask it through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: "Glori- 
ous is Thy Name, O Lord," and after 
benediction by Patriarch John Smith, 
the conference adjourned until Wed- 
nesday, April 6, at 10 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY. 



Wednesday, April 6, 10 a. m. 
The choir sang the hymn: 

"Sweetly may the blessed Spirit 
On each faithful bosom shine; 
May we every grace inherit; 
Lord, we seek a boon divine.'' 

Prayer was offered by Elder Angus 
M. Cannon. 
The choir and congregation sang, 

"Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion." 

ELDER CHRISTIAN N. LUND, 
(President of North Sanpete Stake). 
My Brethren and Sisters: I must say 
that this call came to me this morning 
very unexpectedly, and I very much de- 
sire that the few moments I shall oc- 
cupy I may enjoy the Spirit of the 
Lord and be assisted by your faith and 
prayers. It is the first time in my life 
that I have stood before so large a con- 
gregation. I have been very much grati- 
fied during this conference to listen to 
the many excellent remarks that have 
been made by our brethren who have 
addressed us. I have been edified and 
built up in my faith, and I have felt 
to thank the Lord with all my heart 
that I have been permitted to be num- 
bered with this people. I heard some of 
the brethren say that they felt hon- 



ored. Any man may well feel honored 
to be identified with this marvelous 
work that the Lord has instituted in the 
earth in these days. When I entered 
this building this morning l was think- 
ing that this is the seventy-fourth an- 
niversary of the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth 
in the latter days. Seventy-four years 
ago today the Lord inspired His great 
prophet, who was then but a youth, to 
organize His church upon the earth for 
the last time. He had previously been 
given the promise, when the angel con- 
ferred upon him the Aaronic priesthood, 
that that priesthood should not be 
taken from the earth until the sons of 
Levi should offer an offering unto the 
Lord in righteousness. That promise 
has been given to no other dispensation 
and to no other people, but it was given 
to this dispensation, indicating that 
the work which God established 
through the Prophet should remain; 
that it was not to be given to another 
people, and it was not to be taken 
away again, as had been the case in 
farmer dispensations. That promise 
has no doubt comforted the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints in hours of af- 
fliction, when the clouds of darkness 



ELDER CHRISTIAN M. LUND. 



57 



have obscured the heavens. It is a 
source of comfort to us today, as it has 
been ever since the work was intro- 
duced. When we look back over this 
period of time we can praise 
the name of the Lord and say that 
so far He hath verified that promises 
This Church ha s grown from that day 
to the present, in numbers, in strength, 
in power, in righteousness, and in all 
that tends to make us mighty in the 
earth. 

When the Savior was asked in His 
day to tell what should be the signs 
of His coming and of the end of the 
world, He told a number of things 
that should transpire before that time. 
One of these signs was that the Gospel 
of the kingdom should be preached 
to all the world for a witness, and then 
should the end come. This seems to 
me the great mission of the Church 
in this dispensation, to send the Gospel 
to all nations for a witness before the 
end shall come. When our Elders go 
into the various nations of the earth 
they do not expect to convert all the 
people, but they go to warn all people, 
to preach the Gospel for a witness to 
all nations where they have the privi- 
lege of going, that all men may be 
without an excuse before the Lord in 
the day of judgment. 

I feel honored to have the privilege 
of being a member of this Church. I 
feel grateful to my Heavenly Father 
that He called me from the land that 
gave me birth; that He sent his ser- 
vant, our great Apostle of the North, 
as we used to call him— Brother Erastus 
Snow — who came to our country to turn 
the keys of the Gospel to the thousands 
and tens of thousands of the blood of 
Israel in those lands. I feel grateful 
that in my boyhood this message of the 
Gospel came to me, and that God 
touched my heart, enlightened my mind 
and inspired my soul to understand the 
truth. I felt at once that it was from 
the Lord, and I have felt so from that 
time to the present. I have tried to give 
to this work my best thoughts, my best 
efforts; and I trust that this shall be my 
aim in the future. 



A little over three years ago the 
Sanpete Stake of Zion was divided in 
two, and I was called upon to preside 
over the North Sanpete Stake, which 
comprises the north portion of Sanpete 
county. I want to say here, by way 
of report of that stake, that we have 
in that stake a good people; a people 
who are desirous of serving the Lord 
and who are trying to keep His com- 
mandments and to roll forward this 
great work. They are endeavoring 
to pay their tithes and their offerings 
unto the Lord, and to live so that they 
may enjoy His Holy Spirit. We 
have eleven wards in our stake, 
some very small and some large. 
They are presided over by some of our 
best men. Since coming to conference 
we have been notified of the death of 
one of our most worthy men — Bishop 
James A. Allred — who has presided over 
Spring City ward for the last 23 years. 
A better man, a better presiding offi- 
cer, I do not think we have or have had 
in our stake. He was 84 or 85 years 
of age, but until within a few months 
he seemed to be strong, energetic and 
capable of taking charge of everything 
pertaining to his ward, and he had its 
affairs in his hands just as though he 
were a young man. We regret very 
much to lose his services, but we feel 
that he has performed a most glorious 
mission. He has been an example that 
will be a strength to that ward and to 
that stake for years to come. So I may 
say about our Bishops generally. They 
are men of God. Our High Council, and 
our brethren who have charge of the 
various organizations,, are likewise 
men of God, and are trying to perform 
their duty to the very best of their abil- 
ity. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I real- 
ize that the time of this conference is 
very precious, and it would not be 
proper for me, nor do I feel inclined, 
to occupy more of it, but I am glad to 
bear this testimony to you this morn- 
ing. I know as well as I know my own 
existence that this is the work of God. 
The Lord has revealed this to me 
through His holy Spirit. I know that 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I 
know that he held the keys of this dis- 
pensation, and that God revealed Him- 
self to him, in connection with His 
Son, Jesus Christ. I know that the 
men who have succeeded him in the 
presidency of this Church have been 
men of God and prophets of the Lord. 
I bear the same testimony concerning 
President Joseph F. Smith, who now 
stands at the head of this great work 
upon the earth. I sustain him as a 
prophet of the Lord. I sustain his coun- 
selors, and the Apostles also, as men of 
God. I pray for them continually, and 
ask God to bless and strengthen them 
to carry the grave responsibilities and 
burdens which are laid upon their 
shoulders to the honor and glory of 
God and the blessing and benefit of His 
people. May God bless us all, I ask it 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MOSES W. TAYLOR, 
(President of Summit Stake). 

My brethren and sisters, I desire an 
interest in your faith and prayers, 
that what I say may be inspired from 
on high. I am very much pleased with 
the remarks that were made by Presi- 
dent C. N. Lund. I was very glad to 
hear him say, "I pray for the authori- 
ties of the Church, and I sustain them." 
There is something wonderful in the 
thought that we pray, and then that we 
practice what we pray. I would like to 
see every Latter-day Saint practice 
what they pray. "When one of my coun- 
selors was selected and the authorities 
asked him what he thought about it, 
he said, "I can live my religion, but I 
fear I cannot preach it." The Apos- 
tles said to him, "You are the man we 
want. We want somebody that can 
live their religion and not preach so 
much." And I think it would be a good 
thing to go a little further and say, 
"We can practice what we pray." I 
have heard of some Latter-day Saints 
praying to the Lord to sustain the 
prophet, seer, and revelator who stands 
at the head of the Church, and then 
go out on the street corners finding 
fault with some recent instructions or 
counsels given by the President. I 



would like that class of people, if I 
had anything to do with tnem, to say, 
"I will practice what I pray." 

As far as the Summit Stake of Zion 
is concerned, we live on the tops of the 
mountains, and when anyDOdy asks us 
how we are getting along we always 
say we are still on top. I can testify 
that we have some excellent Saints in 
Summit County. We have some good 
Bishops, some good High Councilors, 
some good Superintendents of Sunday 
Schools, of Religion Classes, of Pri- 
mary Associations, and of Mutual Im- 
provement Associations. They are very 
active and energetic. Our home mis- 
sionaries are also active, and it does 
not matter how muddy the roads are, 
or how far they have to travel, they 
almost invariably fulfil their appoint- 
ments. l«on»etimes one may excuse 
himself on account of having a sore 
foot, or something of that kind, but as 
a rule when any of them have a sore 
foot they wrap a rag around it and go 
anyhow. That's the kind of people 
we have in Summit Stake of Zion. 
I sometimes think that we have a 
few out there whose labor consists 
principally in standing around, after 
they have pi'ayed to sustain the au- 
thorities of the Church, and "knocking" 
those same authorities. But there are 
very few of this kind; I generally say 
we have just about six. "We have not 
the richest piece of land on the face of 
the earthy. and we sometimes have frost 
on the Fourth of July; but when our 
potatoes are frozen, it seems like the 
Lord blesses them and they begin to 
come up again, so that before the close 
of the year we have some good pota- 
toes. Occasionally they may be small, 
but they are the kind that falls down 
like flour when they are cooked, and 
are good to eat. Everything out there 
is good. Our lettuce is crisp and good, 
and all else that we have we think is 
good. We have coal mines, gold mines, 
silver mines, and everything of that 
kind. "While we sometimes think we 
are the poorest people on the face of 
the earth, yet we know that out of 
Summit county comes most of the 
riches of the state. Nearly all the rich

men of Utah have made their fortunes 
in Summit county, but they always 
move away when they get rich. Broth- 
er Clawson remarks, "then you must 
have the poor with you always." That 
is a true saying-; but our poor, as a 
rule, are the independent poor. I have 
been in- some of the wards where, af- 
ter the Bishops have collected the fast 
offerings, they have asked me if they 
couldn't use them for the benefit of 
the ward; "because," they said, "we 
are all poor in this ward." That is 
about the way some of them talk; yet 
when I ask how many mortgages they 
have in their town, the reply is, "Oh, 
we have no mortgages, but we are all 
poor." Well, when a man is in a con- 
dition where he doesn't owe anything', 
we consider him well off; and we try 
to teach the people to show the best 
side. My father. President John Tay- 
lor, believed in that idea. I remember 
a number of years ago Baron Roths- 
child, supposed to be the richest man 
in the world, came to Utah. He had 
known my father in France when he 
was on a mission, and father desired 
to entertain him while he was here. 
He had an old carriage, and he had two 
black horses, and about a dozen boys, 
so he made a combination. He got the 
boys out, and we washed the harness, 
we blacked it with black oil, rubbed and 
greased the old carriage to make it look 
nice, and then on the morning of 
Rothschild's arrival father came out 
with a great big black cloak that he 
used to put on in Prance. There 
were the horses, there was the 
carriage, all polished up and looking 
fine, and Rothschild didn't know but 
father was a millionaire. I say that 
the Latter-day Saints ought to put the 
best side out. I remember once go- 
ing up on the street after I had returned 
from my mission. My mother, in com- 
mon with the rest of the family, hav- 
ing passed through a great deal of trial 
and hard times, had got into the habit 
of saving — in fact, she hardly knew 
how to do anything else. I had re- 
ceived an official appointment in Salt 
Lake Citv and the first thing I did 
was to buy me a new suit of clothes. 



With these clothes on, I was on the 
street, and father's carriage drove 
along and he had my mother in with 
him. He invited me into the carriage, 
and the 'first thing my mother said upon 
seeing my new suit was, "You extra- 
vagant boy. You'll go to ruin, sure. 
You're always buying something like 
that." I can remember my father's 
remark. He said, "Pshaw, pshaw, let 
the boy dress in accordance with his 
position." .And so I thought. It's a 
good idea to put the best side out. 

I was very glad to see in the paper the 
other day big headlines which read, 
"Clean out your back yards." On one 
occasion, in the Summit Stake of Zion, 
one of the Apostles was going around 
with us, and we went to a house to 
select a Bishop. When we put up our 
team, we had to climb over so much 
manure to get to the barn that the 
Apostle said, and I said, too, "That 
man will never do for a Bishop." So 
brethren, clean out your back yards. 
Make everything clean and respectable, 
so that the Lord and His angels would 
be glad to come and dwell with you. 
Even a common man like the president 
of a stake does not want to dwell with 
you if your houses are unclean. Keep 
the best side out, and if you do, the 
Lord will bless you and increase you 
in many ways. May the Lord bless us 
all, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 
(President of Fremont Stake.) 

I feel honored, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to be permitted to bear my testi- 
mony in connection with my brethren. 
I rejoice that I am counted worthy to 
be numbered among the Latter-day 
Saints. I desire to thank my Heaven- 
ly Father for His protecting care and 
kindness toward me in casting my lot 
among this people, so that my stubborn 
nature has been more or less brought 
into subjection to His will through my 
associations with His people. My 
experience leads me to believe 
that mankind naturally are prone to do 
evil, and that it requires constant as- 
sociation with good people and proper 
influences to keep us in touch with the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Spirit of God. I bear my testimony to 
you this morning' that in all the asso- 
ciations I have had with the Latter- 
day Saints— which has been from my 
early boyhood — I have never yet been 
taught anything but what would make 
me a better man than I otherwise would 
be. There is nothing in Mormonism 
that will make of us undesirable citi- 
zens of any nation. I have been taught 
from my earliest boyhood as you no 
doubt all have, to obey and honor the 
laws of the land; in fact, it is said in 
one of the revelations of the Almighty 
that if we will keep the laws of God we 
will have no need to break the laws of 
the land. I desire to testify to all 
under the sound of my voice that the 
Latter-day Saints are a patriotic peo- 
ple, an industrious people, a people who 
have made the desert wastes blossom 
as the rose. They have proved to be a 
desirable community wheresoever their 
lots have been cast. It is really as- 
tounding to see the benefits that the 
country has derived from the location 
of the Latter-day Saints in the section 
where I am called to labor. Twenty- 
one years ago, when we went in to that 
country, I remember that from Pocatel- 
lo northward for hundreds of miles 
scarcely anything could be found but 
sagebrush, sandy wastes, cactus, and 
desert plains. There was very little 
that was pleasing to the eye. But 
through the establishment of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in that locality, you 
can find in that country today a con- 
tinuous stretch of productive fields and 
gardens from Pocatello almost into the 
Yellowstone National park. At that 
time there were perhaps not 
more than two hundred Latter- 
day Saints located in that country. To- 
day we have in the neighborhood of 
twenty thousand, and the workmanship 
of their hands can be seen on every 
side. Towns and villages have sprung 
up, and the history made by our peo- 
ple in that locality is such that the 
State of Idaho is proud to acknowledge 
us as citizens. When our brethren 
have been honored with positions in 
the representative halls of that State 
they have been treated with the great- 



est courtesy, and have been looked up- 
on as men of honor, clean and honest 
in all their conduct. "We have done a 
noble work in that part of the country. 
I am proud to say we have erected a 
very fine school building, acknowledged 
by the Governor and other representa- 
tive men of the State as perhaps the 
finest school building in the State. It 
has been built by the Latter-day Saints, 
and that in small contributions. This 
stands today as a monument to the cred- 
it of our people, and it should stand 
forever as an evidence that we are an 
education-loving people. The claim 
made by some who are not of us that 
"Mormonism" thrives best where ig- 
norance prevails to the greatest extent, 
is untrue. Our people have shown by 
their efforts that they love education, 
and they believe in the motto, "Intelli- 
gence is the glory of God." We are 
using every endeavor to bring up the 
young and rising generation in a way 
that will be pleasing to our heavenly 
Father, and that will make them good 
citizens of whatever land they live in. 

I indorse most heartily the testimo- 
nies that have been given by our breth- 
ren during this Conference. In the Fre- 
mont Stake of Zion we uphold the au- 
thorities of the Church, not only with 
our faith and prayers, but with our ac- 
tions. I have in my home the pictures 
of the Presidency of the Church and 
the Twelve Apostles, and I point out 
each one of them to my children as be- 
ing a man of God. I am sure that not 
only from Utah and the States on the 
South, but from the State of Idaho also, 
will come a host of people who will up- 
hold the Presidency of this Church, who 
esteem Joseph Smith as a prophet, and 
those who have succeeded him as his 
lawful and legal successors. I rejoice, 
my brethren and sisters, to be associat- 
ed with you. I bear my testimony to 
the truthfulness of the latter-day work. 
If we will be good Latter-day Saints, 
we will be good American citizens, be- 
cause the Gospel requires nothing of us 
but what will make of us better men, 
and better citizens of any nation where 
our lots may be cast. May God bless 
you and inspire us all to remain firm

and true to the covenants we have 
made with Him, and above all things 
to be united together in the bonds of 
love and union, having the Spirit of God 
dwelling in our hearts, that we may in 
very deed be the children of God. I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JESSE N. SMITH. 
(President of Snowflake Stake.) 

I feel greatly honored, brethren and 
sisters, to come before you for a few 
moments. The Saints in our part of the 
world are few in number, but they are 
very good and faithful people. We 
have, I think I may say, lived down to 
a great extent the prejudice tnat exist- 
ed among our outside brethren and sis- 
ters. The people of Arizona generally 
are a good people. They are not relig- 
ious, however, as the world regards re- 
ligion; still they are large hearted, lib- 
eral, and willing that others shall en- 
joy the rights of conscience. Our wards 
are fully organized. We have six small 
wards in our stake. In that part of the 
country there are not many facilities in 
any one place for the settlement and 
sustenance of the people. We have 
made some advancement educationally. 
We have good schools. Our academy 
is in a good situation and doing good 
work. We rejoice in the prosperity of 
the cause. Although far away from 
you, we endeavor to keep pace with the 
progress of events. We have a lively 
interest in all that pertains to the up- 
building of the kingdom of God. I sup- 
pose I may say that we are not very 
well off for this world's goods, and 
when our brethren are so fortunate as 
to get a little ahead in that direction, 
they generally move to more favored 
localities. This is all right, so far as 
I know. We bid them God speed 
when they go to other places, and hope 
for their prosperity. I esteem it a 
great happiness that I have received 
faith in this work. I have never sup- 
posed that I was naturally much in- 
clined to be religious, but it was my 
good fortune to have God-fearing par- 
ents who started me in this line. I 
think it was owing to my parentage, 
my kindred, and my surroundings that 



I became religious. I have the very 
highest regard for religion, and for 
religious people. I have made this sub- 
ject the study of my life, and the more 
I have investigated the Gospel as it has 
been restored to us, the more satisfying 
it has been to me. Very early in child- 
hood I heard the voice of that great 
man, Joseph Smith, and although I was 
young his words penetrated my heart. 
I believed them, I have believed them 
ever since, I shall always believe them. 
I can express my thankfulness for these 
happy and blessed surroundings which 
have caused these earnest reflections. 
I have not only investigated the faith 
that was delivered to me by my par- 
ents, but I have investigated all faiths, 
so far as I hav e had opportunity. I 
respect all religious people, but I do not 
respect hypocritical people. I respect 
every sincere person who has faith in 
God. I could never persecute any one 
for the matter of conscience. I regard 
the unbeliever as the most unfortu- 
nate of men. In my reflections, it has 
seemed to me that even idolatry is more 
to be preferred than infidelity. I believe 
that the natural man is prone to seek 
his Creator; I believe that is a natur- 
al and a proper impulse, and those who 
disregard these higher promptings, are 
the unnatural and the abnormal. This 
is the result of my reflections. I be- 
lieve in the interposition of Divine 
Providence in the affairs of men. I be- 
lieve that He guides the destinies of 
peoples and of individuals, I therefor^ 
am encouraged to seek Him in prayer.. 
I- offer Him my acknowledgements. 1 
do so, not only as a matter of duty, 
but as a matter of the highest privilege- 
I have endeavored in all my life to be 
exemplary. It is a consolation that I 
have that no human being, I trust, is 
worse for my example. Brethren and 
sisters I rejoice very much in this great 
cause. I know that it is of God. I 
feel it will go on to success, to pros- 
perity, and to triumph, and that the 
nations of the earth will yet bless the 
name of Joseph Smith, and also hold 
in high estimation the Saints of latter 
days. May the Lord add His blessings 
to all our labors, and may we be faith- 
ful in all things. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Sister Olea Shipp then sang, "The 
Bright Beyond." 

ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Men In all dispensations have rejected revelations 
from God — Responsibility o£ c '''ducting the 
work of the Father rests upon the Saints as a 
whole — Sublime position taken by the Prophet 
Joseph. 

My brethren and sisters, I esteem it 
a privilege and an honor to be called 
upon to occupy this position, and while 
I do so, I trust I may be inspired of 
our Heavenly Father, that the words 
I utter may be words of instruction 
and edification to all of us. I have 
enjoyed the spirit of this conference, 
and have been edified by the remarks 
of the brethren who have been called 
upon to address us. It is an ftispiratic 
to one who loves this latter-day work 
to look into the faces of a large con- 
gregation such as this. It inspires him 
with additional love of the work that 
our. Father in heaven has given to the 
earth in the day and age in which we 
live. When we realize that this is but 
a representation of the people who are 
members of the Church, that we come 
htre semi-annually to receive instruc- 
tion, and that the words of life and sal- 
vation which flow from the servants 
of God here ,arei disseminated through- 
out the world, and are also communi- 
cated to the children of the Latter- 
day Saints by the newspapers and 
those who come to conference, we can 
comprehend to some extent the far- 
reaching influence of these gatherings. 

We are considered by the world a 
peculiar people. By the unbeliever, 
the members of the Church of Christ 
in all ages of the world have been 
considered a peculiar people. When 
the Lord has spoken through His serv- 
ants, there have been at different peri- 
ods of time people in the earth who 
have said, "I do not believe in reve- 
lation." This age is no exception to 
the rule. The thousands, aye, the mil- 
liens, of our Father's children who 
live in the earth are but repeating the 
history of the past when they deny 
that God has revealed again His will 
to the children of men, and say that 
they have no need of any further reve- 



lation. To demonstrate this we may 
refer to the experiences of the people in 
the days of Noah. Noah was a prophet 
of the living God, inspired with a de- 
sire to save the souls of the children of 
men. He had no disposition to destroy 
those who lived around him, but, re- 
ceiving a commandment from our 
Father in heaven, he warned the people 
to repent of their evil ways, and de- 
clared that unless they did repent, 
destruction would follow and our 
Heavenly Father would visit them 
with His displeasure. What was the 
result? They said to Noah, "What 
right have you to instruct us? Who 
are you that you come and speak to 
us in the name of the Lord? You are 
only a man like other men." And-they 
rejected his testimony, not because it 
was untrue, but because they would 
not believe it, not possessing the spirit 
which he possessed. Then the Lord 
told him to build an ark, and to gather 
therein those who believed his message, 
and then He would visit His displeasure 
upon the inhabitants of the earth. It 
was not because Noah had said these 
things that the deluge came; it was 
because Almighty God had spoken 
through him to the people. When our 
Father in heaven speaks to the world, 
no matter how feeble or weak the serv- 
ant may be who carries the message, 
that word will be vindicated, even if it 
involves the destruction of many souls. 
You no doubt remember the experience 
of Jonah when he was called to warn 
the people of Nineveh. Our Father in 
heaven commanded him to go and call 
them to repentance. He tried to avoid 
this responsibility, and it resulted in 
his being thrown into the ocean. But 
the same power that had called him 
to this mission preserved his life, and 
rebuked him. for avoiding what was his 
plain duty. Then he went and warned 
the people of Nineveh, and they repent- 
ed in sackcloth and ashes. You will 
remember the Lord promised that if 
they did not repent they would be pun- 
ished; but they did repent, and He 
removed from them the curse that 
otherwise would have been visited up- 
on them for the violation — of what? 



EL.DE R GEORGE A. SMITH. 



63 



Not because they failed to listen to 
Jonah as a man, but because they fail- 
ed to. heed Jonah, the prophet of God. 
And when they did listen to the voice 
of the Lord through that inspired man, 
they received a blessing- instead of a 
cursing. 

When our Savior in humility came 
upon earth, the people said, "Who are 
you, that you should claim to be th^ 
Son of God? We know your father; he 
is Joseph, the carpenter. We know 
your mother; she is Mary. We have 
Moses and Abraham for our prophets, 
and we have no need of a man like 
you to come and speak to us in the 
name of the Lord." He went among 
them and ministered to the sick, healed 
the afflicted, unstopped the ears of 
the deaf, restored the blind to sight, 
cleansed the leper by His magic touch, 
raised the dead to life. Then they 
said He performed these wondrous 
works by the power of Beelzebub. Yet 
He was indeed the Son of God. He la- 
bored among them in love and kind- 
ness; but they cast His name out as 
evil. They even cast reproach upon 
the city from which He came, and said, 
"Can any good thing come out of Na- 
zareth?" But He was the Son of God, 
and He did have the right to speak in 
the name of the Father. The truths 
He brought to the earth came from 
the Father; and though they nailed 
Him to the cross, though they placed 
upon His head the plaited crown of 
thorns, and put the mock scepter in 
His hands, though they spilled His 
blood with the cruel spear, yet the 
word that He delivered to them was the 
word of the Lord, and He was indeed 
the Son of God. 

The same, feeling that was en- 
tertained, to some extent, against 
the Savior has continued in the 
earth People who do not under- 
stand the things of God because they 
have not the Spirit of God, reviled and 
cast them out as evil, when in fact the 
evil is in themselves. But the promis- 
es made by the Savior to His Apostles 
when He said, "Go ye into all the world 
and preach the Gosoel unto every 
creature. He that believeth and is bap- 



tized shall be saved," have been veri- 
fied upon the children of men, when 
they have complied with that require- 
ment under the ministration of au- 
thorized servants of God. In the wis- 
dom of our Father, He revealed in 
the olden times that the Gospel would 
be taken away. He revealed in the 
time of Daniel, by means of a dream, 
that in the days of certain kings He 
would set up His kingdom, and that it 
would not be taken away or given to 
another people. He revealed to John, 
upon the Isle of Patmos, that an angel 
would fly in the midst of heaven, 
having the everlasting Gospel t<5 
preach to men that dwell upon the 
earth. Other prophets also prophesied 
concerning the day in which we live. 
In fulfillment of these predictions, our 
Heavenly Father, in the century that 
is just passed, chose and commissioned 
Joseph Smith, as He had done other 
prophets, to go forth among the people 
and speak in the name of the Lord. 
Through this humble instrument, the 
Gospel was restored to the earth again 
and he preached the same doctrines 
that our Savior taught while He was 
upon the earth. Under the Lord s di- 
rection, he organized the Church of 
Christ, with apostles, prophets, pastors, 
teachers, evangelists, etc., as the 
Church should be organized, to con- 
tinue thus until all should come to a 
unity of the faith. He ministered unto 
the people, he healed the sick; he 
loved the souls of the children of men. 
But as had been the case with prophets 
whom the Lord had raised up before 
it seemed necessary in this case that 
the testimony of His servant should be. 
sealed with his life's blood. No more 
pathetic page will be found in the his- 
tory of the world than that upon which 
is inscribed the last sayings of our be- 
loved Prophet Joseph Smith. He 
knew that his time was near at hand; 
he realized that his life's mission had 
been fulfilled. He had given the keys 
for the gifts and blessings of God unto 
the people, and" the Father had con- 
tinued to bless him; finally he realized 
that his labor was about done. You 
remember when he was first raised up 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



how the people of this country said, 
"We have no need of you. You are 
Joseph, the son of Joseph, and we 
know where you come from. You are 
not a strong- and mighty man, and you 
do not come from an influential family. 
We have no need of new revelation. 
We have the Bible, and that is all that 
is necessary for the salvation of the 
children of men." Joseph Smith per- 
formed his mission; and when the time 
came that he was face to face with 
death, he said, "I am going- like a lamb 
to the slaughter, but I am calm as a 
summer morning. I have a conscience 
void of offence toward God and toward 
all men. If they take my life, I shall 
die an innocent man, and my blood 
shall cry from the ground for venege- 
ance, and it shall yet be said of me, 'He 
was murdered in cold blood.' " 
He was not afraid to stand be- 
fore the pleasing bar of our Father in 
heaven and answer for the deeds done 
in the body. He was not afraid to 
meet the charge that had been made 
against him, that he was decieving the 
people and dealing unjustly with them. 
He was not afraid of the result of his 
life's mission, and of the final triumph 
of the work which he knew was of divine 
origin, and for which he gave his life. 
Yet the people of the world, as before, 
judge this work by the spirit of man. 
They do not have the Spirit of God, 
which would enable them to under- 
stand that it came from our Father in 
heaven. 

Now, my brethern and sisters, the 
commission that came to Joseph Smith, 
the boy prophet, has been given to you. 
"Go, preach the Gospel in the nations 
of the earth." The same authority that 
he had has been conferred upon your 
sons, and they will be required by our 
Father in heaven to minister in the 
ordinances of the Gospel. The respon- 
sibility that came to Joseph Smith has 
not been lost by his departure, it has 
fallen upon other shoulders. Our Fa- 
ther in heaven has raised up from 
time to time those who have had the 
authority to speak in His name, to ad- 
minister in the ordinances of the Gos- 
pel, and to bless the children of men. 



They have shared that honor with you 
and with your children. The responsi- 
bility for the conduct of this work does 
not devolve alone upon President Jos- 
eph F. Smith, nor upon his counselors, 
nor upon the quorum of the Apostles; 
but it devolves also upon every man 
and woman who has been baptized by 
the servants of God and become a mem- 
ber of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Every man who has 
received the Priesthood must set hia 
house in order, and so conduct his life 
that men, seeing his good works, may 
glorify our Father which is in heaven. 
We cannot shift the responsibility if 
we would; our Father has placed it up- 
on our shoulders, and we must round 
them up and help to carry it off tri- 
umphant. When I look at large con- 
gregations of the Saints, such as we 
beheld last Sunday, this building filled 
to overflowing, the Assembly Hall and 
adjoining grounds also filled with mul- 
titudes of people, many of them sons 
and daughters of the sturdy pioneers 
who in early days came into this west- 
ern country, or went into foreign na- 
tions of the earth and preached the 
Gospel, I cannot help but rejoice. Grate- 
ful should we be, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that our hearts have been attuned 
to the Gospel's harmony. Grateful 
should we be that our Father in hea- 
ven has given us a testimony of the di- 
vinity of this work; and it should be 
our life's labor to so conduct ourselves 
that we will not bring reproach upon 
it. Those who are beginning to pass 
the meridian of life, those gray-haired 
men and women who sit before me to- 
day, who have borne the burden in the 
heat of the day, who came into this 
country when it was a howling wilder- 
ness, have received from our Heavenly 
Father a testimony that burns in their 
hearts, and they know, as they know 
that they live, that the Gospel is true. 
And this same blessing has been given 
to their children when those children 
have sought it. Our Father in heaven 
has promised all His children that they 
will know of the doctrine, whether it be 
of God or of man, if they will have 

faith anrl nnmnlv witVi tVi^ nrrHtion^oo 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH.

Now, to those who are younger in this 
congregation let me say: Not very 
many years hence your fathers and 
mothers will go back to receive the re- 
ward of their faithful labors.' I plead 
with you, boys and girls of Israel, to 
honor the names that you bear; love 
and revere the parents God has given 
you, and so conduct your lives that 
day by day you will give them joy in 
their declining years. If you will do 
this the same firm testimony that has 
been given to them will be bestowed 
upon you, and your sons and daughters 
in due time will be found numbered 
with the Saints of God, valiant for the 
cause of truth, and the dissemination 
of the Gospel in the nations of the 
earth. We need not fear the wrath of 
the adversary. "We need not fear when 
men speak ill of us, when they cast out 
our names as evil, when they revile us 
and speak of us falsely; but we need 
to fear when the power of the adver- 
sary is arrayed against us if we have 
done that which is wrong. Our Father 
in heaven expects us to live up to the 
requirements of the Gospel; to fear Him 
and keep His commandments. 

Now, as to our friends who are not 
of our faith, we should follow the ad- 
monition: pray for those who persecute 
you, and despitefully use you. Remem- 
ber that you have a testimony of this 
work, which they have not. Some day, 
when we all present ourselves, as we ex- 
pect to do, before the bar of God to 
answer for the deeds done in the body, 
then will our brothers and sisters of 
the world, who now think we are delud- 
ed and mistaken, find that our lives 
have been spent for the salvation of 
their souls, that our ministry has had 
in it only love and kindness for our fel- 
low men, and that we would have given 
unto them a blessing had they been 
willing to receive it. Let us love the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ; let us comply 
with the requirements our Father has 
made of us; and then when we meet 
those who do not understand us, there 
will emanate from us a spirit that will 
testify to them we are sincere in the 
work in which we are engaged. Tour 



boys and girls are scattered among the 
nations of the earth preaching this gos- 
pel; there is no confusion with them; 
they understand it as you understand 
it. It is the same Gospel wherever it is 
taught, and it is the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I bear you my testimony today 
that it is the power of God unto salva- 
tion, unto every one that will believe 
and obey. May we so conduct our lives 
that our Father in heaven will preserve 
us from the attacks of those who mis- 
understand us; and that our brothers 
and sisters of the world may be con- 
strained to acknowledge we are a good 
people, because we do good to our fel- 
low men. May we so conduct our lives 
that the children our Father shall bless 
us with may, by reason of the righteous 
teachings and the good example we give 
unto them,, rise up and call us blessed. 
When the time shall come that we shall 
all be called to present ourselves before 
our Father in heaven to give an account 
for our actions here, may it be said of 
us that the world was better for our 
having lived in it, that we never 
harmed one of our Father's creatures, 
that we sustained the hands of His 
servants, that we understood the spirit 
of revelation, and that we listened to it 
as it came from God to His servants. 
My prayer is that our lives may reflect 
the purity of the Gospel, that our homes 
may be the abode of the Spirit of our 
Father in heaven, that our every action 
may be scanned in vain for any evil, 
and that when men shall look over our 
lives, they may be led to say we are 
consistent followers of the meek and 
lowly Nazarene. In the end, when our 
labors are complete.may we receive from 
our Father, who reigns supreme in the 
heavens, that welcome plaudit, 'Well 
done, good and faithful servant, you 
have been faithful in a few things, 
and I will make you ruler over many. 
Enter into the joy of your Lord," is my 
prayer for Israel, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 
The choir sang: 

"Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Saints unto the promised land."

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

"Wednesday, April 6, 2 p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

'We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet,, 
To guide us in these latter days." 

The invocation was offered by Elder 
Andrew Jenson. 

The choir then sang: 

"Though in the outward Church below 
The wheat and tares together grow." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

In standing before you, my brethren 
and sisters, this afternoon, to bear my 
testimony to the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ as it has been revealed in 
the age of the world in which we are 
living, I sincerely pray that I may be 
supported by the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord, that the # few words 
I speak upon this occasion may be 
words of truth, directed by the Spirit 
of Truth, for the benefit, advantage, 
and encouragement of this vast congre- 
gation. My heart has been filled with 
exceeding great joy in listening to the 
testimonies that have been borne by 
the various speakers who have ad- 
dressed the people from day to day in 
our Conference meetings. My soul has 
been filled with thankfulness, not only 
during this Conference, but in travel- 
ing from place to place among the peo- 
ple, in attending stake conferences, in 
meeting with the quorums of Seventy, 
in observing, as we have no doubt ob- 
served in this Conference, that there are 
many young men occupying responsible 
positions in the midst of the people of 
the Lord. I have noted that many of 
the brethren who have stood here to 
make reports concerning the stakes of 
Zion, and to speak about other matters, 
are the sons of men who have been vali- 
ant for the truth in days gone by. In 
the organization of the new Stakes of 
Zion, recently effected in this city, many 
of the brethren who have been called to 
positions of responsibility in these 
stakes are the sons of men who in their 
time have been faithful to the Lord. 

I believe we all find happiness in wit- 
nessing conditions of this character, 
and in having the truth burned into our 
souls that our Father in heaven is 



blessing the children of the pioneers, 
and of other men and women who re- 
ceived the Gospel a long time ago, and. 
gathered from the nations of the earth, 
and that He is establishing them in 
the faith. I rejoice in the testimonies of 
the brethren in relation to this mat- 
ter. Some of the speakers have ex- 
pressed very great confidence that the 
youth of the Latter-day Saints would 
be found in the future true to the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and to the faith of 
their fathers, and that they were not, 
and could not, be- weaned away from 
the truth. I believe this with all my 
heart. I believe it is the decree of the 
Almighty that this condition shall con- 
tinue to prevail in the midst of His peo- 
ple, and that there will always be found 
in the Church the seed of the founders, 
and of others who have been valiant for 
the testimony of Jesus — children who 
will properly represent their parents 
before the people and before the Lord; 
and that it is not the intention for thi^ 
work to be taken from them and given 
to another people. I have felt impressed 
myself with the promise of God in re- 
lation to the continuation of His work 
with the people who were called in the 
beginning. In that promise, as it ap- 
peals to me, there is an understanding 
that there would be raised up, from 
the loins of those to whom the promise 
was made in the beginning, sons and 
daughters who would be true and faith- 
ful. It is true that power is not given 
to man to reveal a knowledge of the 
plan of salvation to his own offspring. 
The President of the Church, the Apos- 
tles, let them be ever so faithful, do 
not possess the power to reveal unto 
their children the truth of the everlast- 
ing Gospel. I suppose if this power 1 
were vested in them there would be 
danger of the time coming when the 
children might be recreant to the faith 
of their fathers. But when the truth of 
the Gospel is revealed to any soul, it 
does not come from man, it comes 
through the operation of the Holy Ghost 
from our Father in heaven. It comes 
with almierhty power; it dispels all 
doubt; it establishes the one who re- 
ceives the evidence in an understanding 
of the truth of the things of God. In

this way the testimony of the Gospel 
has come to the Latter-day Saints. In 
the beginning, when the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith bore the wonderful record 
that he did to the people concerning the 
visitation of holy beings, it was by the 
power of the Holy Ghost and not by the 
wisdom or logic of the Prophet that the 
truth of his testimony was impressed 
upon the minds of the men who accept- 
ed it, and who remained true all the 
days of their lives. "We cannot believe 
that it was by a mere chance that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in the early rise 
of the Church was brought in contact 
with such men as Brigham Young, John 
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo 
Snow, Heber C. Kimball, Daniel H. 
Wells, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, 
and other great men who were raised 
up by the power of God to assist in the 
establishment of His purposes. We be- 
lieve, as a people, that our Father un- 
derstands the end from the beginning. 
"We believe that He is in very deed our 
Father in heaven; that we existed with 
Him in a spiritual condition before we 
were born naturally upon the earth, 
and that He knew us, and all His other 
children, before we came to this earth. 
"We believe He was acquainted with 
the spirits of the great men who as- 
sisted in laying the foundations of His 
grand latter-day work, and that by 
His decree and appointment they were 
born into the world at the time when 
their services were needed in the estab- 
lishment of His purposes. They were 
brought by the same overruling provi- 
dence into contact with the noble man 
who had been raised from the ranks of 
the people to bear divine authority, and 
to represent the Lord God of heaven 
in the midst of the nations, and they 
gladly received the testimony which 
was delivered to them concerning the 
faith. "While we believe this of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and of his as- 
sociates, we believe that the same 
power is in operation today. We be- 
lieve that the spirits of men are being 
born into the world by divine appoint- 
ment, and not by accident. Because 
of this belief, I feel in my heart that, 
through the faithfulness of the fathers 
and mothers in the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints, there will 
continue to come to them choice spirits, 
who will accept the truth with all their 
hearts, and who will bear the respon- 
sibilities of this work in which we are 
engaged in all time to come. I do not 
believe that the names of the valiant 
and faithful men of this Church of 
either high or low degree are to become 
extinct from among the people of God. 
I believe with all my soul that they 
will be perpetuated forever, just as we 
see the sons of men whom we have 
known in past history stand upon this 
platform, filled with the Spirit of the 
living God, bearing testimony to the 
truth of the everlasting Gospel, so in 
a time to come will their sons and 
daughters, from generation to genera- 
tion stand up in the midst of the con- 
gregations of Israel and bear record of 
the truth as it has been revealed. God 
has not brought us through the trying 
experiences of the past; He has not 
tested our fathers and our mothers in 
the manner in which they have been 
tested, with a view of rewarding them 
with offspring that will not be true to 
Him. There may be wayward boys and 
girls; there may be some who cannot 
be controlled; but I believe there will 
be but few who will be lost. "We dis- 
cover among the people who have gath- 
ered from the nations of the world that 
there is within them a love for the land 
that gave them birth. From whatever 
land they have come, though they have 
been led to forsake all and gather up 
to Zion, because of the Gospel, never- 
theless there is a love in their hearts 
for their native country, which does 
not die out. In like manner I believe, 
from the experiences that have come 
to me, that there is a love for Zion 
and for the things of the kingdom of 
God planted in the hearts of those 
who are born in the Church that is very 
much stronger than this love of coun- 
try, and that it is almost impossible 
for men to divest themselves of it. In 
many places young men and young 
women are found who have strayed 
away from the truth to some extent; 
•who have gone from their father's 
home and from the organized wards of 
the Church; but wherever they are

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



they have a warm feeling toward the 
work of God. It is a rare thing to 
find a young man or a young woman 
who has been born in the Church so 
cold in their feelings that they turn 
entirely away from the people of the 
Lord. It is a rare thing to find any 
so hardened that they will not open 
their doors to receive the representa- 
tives of the Lord. Because of this feel- 
ing, and because of the valiant young 
men who are constantly rising up in the 
midst of Israel, I believe that we will 
always have representatives of the 
founders of the Church of Christ to 
bear the authority of the Holy Priest- 
hood, and to bear it in honor. The 
glorious example that has been set by 
good and godly parents is destined to 
bear good fruit forever. I believe that 
there is something in being born in 
Zion. It has been stated by at least 
one of the prophets that the time was 
to come when it should be said of in- 
dividuals born in Zion, that "this man 
was born in Zion." I think we have 
occasion as parents to be comforted 
and encouraged, and that we have 
reason to have confidence in our chil- 
dren. I believe that, by the blessing of 
the Lord and our own example and 
training, our children will be so estab- 
lished in the faith that they will follow 
in our footsteps just as we are follow- 
ing in the footsteps of our parents. 

Let us take to heart the counsels 
that have been imparted unto us. Let 
us set gfoodly examples before our 
offspring. Let us live the religion we 
have espoused, and let our light shine 
among men. Let them see that we feel 
the responsibility which rests upon ua 
in the revelation of the Gospel; 
that we propose, not only to send 
missionaries abroad to preach the 
Gospel, but that we propose to live 
our religion at home just as well 
as our representatives do abroad; and 
men and women who come into our bor- 
ders, as has often been the case al- 
ready, will be so impressed with our so- 
briety, our industry, our good example 
and the godly lives we lead that they 
will be constrained to bear record that 
there is a splendid people in the midst 



of these mountains — a people who fear 
God and keep His commandments. In 
a time to come we will be better under- 
stood. The clouds that have hung over 
us, caused by misrepresentation, will be 
banished away. There is no power that 
can prevent this; for God Himself has 
decreed He will lift His people up; 
that they shall be like unto a. light set 
upon a hill, which cannot be hid; and 
we will be known as we are. "When we 
are known as we are, then the reputa- 
tion that has gone abroad concerning 
us through misrepresentation will pass 
away forever, and we will be recognized 
as the people of the Lord, as a people 
who love their fellowmen, and who 
have had the message of truth commit- 
ted to them, even the power of the 
everlasting Gospel which can save to 
the uttermost all men in every land 
and clime. 

I bear record to the truth of the Gos- 
pel. I bear record to the integrity, the 
honor, the uprightness and the nobility 
of the men who preside over us. I 
bear testimony to the glorious fact that 
with us there is divine authority. Let 
the world say what it may, truth is 
truth, and the truth in relation to this 
matter is that God has spoken, and 
has given to man His authority, and 
in the exercise of that power we will 
cry, "peace on earth, good will to men," 
and we will preach the doctrines of the 
Gospel, administer its holy ordinances 
to those who believe, and save the chil- 
dren of men in the way appointed of 
the Father. May God help us to be 
true and faithful, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ and in the 
splendid testimonies that have been 
borne of its divine truth during this 
conference. I am sure that the Latter- 
day Saints must feel greatly strength- 
ened in their testimonies by naving at- 
tended the meetings of this conference, 
for truly there has been an outpouring 
of the Spirit of God upon His people. 
As I look before me upon this vast con- 
gregation, gathered here upon this 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

Wednesday afternoon, it is almost mar- 
velous to see so many faces, and all in- 
tent upon receiving the word of God 
as it shall be spoken* unto them. I 
have prayed earnestly in my neart that 
the people might be fed the bread of 
life, that their testimonies might be 
strengthened, and that they might 
come to an absolute knowledge of the 
truthfulness of this work in which we 
are engaged. I do not think it possi- 
ble for us to pay too much attention 
to the importance of having an individ- 
ual testimony of the Gospel. Every Lat- 
ter-day Saint has the utmost need to 
know for himself that this is the work 
of the Lord, and to know that God has 
spoken again in this day and conferred 
upon men His divine authority. We 
read in the scriptures, and have been 
told from time to time, that the Lord 
will have a tried people. The only thing 
that will enable the people to withstand 
the trials that may come upon them will 
be the knowledge which they have that 
this is the work of God. When that 
knowledge has taken root in their 
hearts, the storms of adversity and 
great calamities may come, but 
they will stand firm and im- 
movable because their, faith will 
be founded upon the rock of reve- 
lation. We have just been told that no 
father or mother can reveal to their 
children the truthfulness of the Gos- 
pel. That is true; but there is a Father, 
whom we all adore, that can and will 
reveal it to us, if we will seek after it 
and do what is necessary to obtain it. 
God is .uove. He loves the souls of the 
children of men, and we are His child- 
ren and have inherited from Him His 
divine attributes. There should be born 
in us a love for our heavenly Father. 
The great commandment, which in- 
cludes all others, is this: "Thou shalt 
love the Lord, thy God, with all thy 
heart, with all thy might, and with all 
thy soul." And there is another 
like unto it: "Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself." If the 
love of God has taken root in 
our hearts, and if we are de- 
monstrating in our lives that love, it 
will bear fruit and will cause us to come 
to a knowledge of God, whom to 



know is life eternal. There are many 
people professing to believe in Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, who, never- 
theless, do not believe in this vital prin- 
ciple of His Gospel — the principle by 
which Peter knew that Jesus was the 
Christ. They have rejected that prin- 
ciple, and have said in their hearts and 
with their lips that God does not re- 
veal Himself from heaven. They do 
not believe in the principle of revela- 
tion; and yet it is the principle which 
gives life and force, and without it 
the Church of Christ cannot exist upon 
the earth. Not only does this principle 
pertain to the leaders of the people, but 
it extends to all the sons and daughters 
of God who will seek to obtain a knowl- 
edge of His divine will. We can all have 
the right to communication with 
our Father, and the Scriptures are full 
of promise! that if we will ask we shall 
receive, if we will knock the door shall 
be opened unto us, and if we will seek 
we shall find. This can only be done 
through the operation of that vital 
principle of revelation. "For no man 
knoweth the things of God, but by the 
Spirit of God, which is in him;" and 
the Spirit of God is the spirit of reve- 
lation, which issues forth from the 
presence of the Father and the Son 
and enters into the being of all those 
who diligently seek them. If we come 
to the knowledge of the truth it must 
be through the principle of revelation. 
We must know that God will listen to 
our prayers; and then when we have 
trials we can approach Him and ask 
of Him wisdom, with the full assurance 
that He will not upbraid or censure us, 
but will hearken to our prayers and 
answer them upon our heads. I know 
that this principle is true, and it de- 
volves upon us to gain the favor of 
God. Men and women in the world 
are seeking more the favor of their fel- 
low creatures, and if they can obtain 
that to the extent that they can be 
exalted in the eyes of the people, that 
seems to be more their ambition than 
the gaining of the favor of God. They 
are more ambitious to be well spoken 
of by their fellow men than they are to 
be beloved of God their eternal Father.

GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



Hence the importance of learning to 
keep that great commandment of lov- 
ing the Lord, with all our hearts. What 
do we understand by loving the Lord 
with all our hearts? Is it the function 
of the heart to love? This may perhaps 
be only a figure. The heart is an or- 
gan of the body, the special office of 
which is to pump the blood in the 
body, causing it to circulate and to im- 
part life and vitality to every part 
thereof. The hands and feet are gov- 
erned by muscles, and they, with other 
members of the body, yield implicit 
obedience to the will of man. We go 
here and there, from one place to an- 
other, at the dictation of the mind, the 
intelligent part of man, and there is 
perfect harmony in the operations of 
the body in obedience to the will of 
man. But not so with the heart. Al- 
though governed by muscles as the 
hands and feet are, yet it is not sub- 
ject to the will of man. We labor with 
our hands, and we may employ the 
muscles of the body in various activi- 
ties, and as the night comes on and we 
lay our bodies down to rest, the mus- 
cles relax and the body lies dormant. 
No so with the heart. It beats on, and 
on, throughout the night as the day; 
and when that heart ceases to beat, 
then life is gone. The mind does not 
control the heart. It does not say to 
the heart, 'beat thou on," or 'cease 
thou now to beat." The heart is gov- 
erned by a higher intelligence, and 
when the voice comes from Him, "Cease 
thou to beat," that son or daughter is 
called to God. So that when the Lord 
says, "Son, give me thine heart," He 
asks for that which belongs to Him; 
and when He requires us to love Him 
with all our hearts it means simply 
this: that we should love Him with all 
our life. The life-giving power of man 
should be devoted to the service of 
God. Whatever may be our occupation, 
everything must come secondary to our 
allegiance and devotion to God, who 
gave us life and being upon earth, and 
by whom that life is maintained. It 
seems to me, my brethren and sisters, 
that if we would keep that great com- 
mandment and love the Lord with all 
our hearts, then would our feet be 



planted in the paths of safety and then, 
let come what may, we are founded 
upon the rock and we will be able to 
stand. , 

I have a testimony that this is the 
work of the Lord that we are engaged 
in, and that the men who stand at the 
head, and whom we will have the pleas- 
ure and privilege this afternoon of sus- 
taining by the raising of our hands, 
are men of God, called of Him to lead 
this people. The prayers of the Latter- 
day Saints should be united in asking 
our Father in heaven to endow them 
with the revelations of His will, that 
they. may receive the mind and will of 
God concerning His people, and that 
we may be ready and willing at all 
times to receive their counsels and to be 
guided in our lives by the will of the 
Father. This is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Sister Lottie Owen, with excellent 
effect, then sang, "Entreat Me Not to 
Leave Thee." 

ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 

My brethren and sisters, I esteem it a, 
privilege and a blessing to have the 
opportunity of bearing my testimony in 
association with by brethren who have 
spoken, for truly I can say I know this 
is the work of God. I know it in every 
part of my being. I feel it in my 
physical nature; I see it in my intel- 
lectual nature; I realize it in my spirit- 
ual nature; for I have been baptized 
by the spirit of this work, not only in 
water, but by the Holy. Ghost and by 
the fire of the Lord, and God has borne 
witness to my soul that He is the au- 
thor of this latter-day work. The 
sentiment expressed by the song which 
our sister has just sung for us is the 
sentiment of my heart. All my inter- 
ests are identified with the Latter-day 
Saints. This people shall be my people; 
their God shall be my God; where they 
go I want to go, whether it be in this 
world or the world to come. With 
these my brethren whom I love, and 
whose labors I recognize, and whose 
virtues I venerate. I want to be as- 
sociated in time and in eternity. My 
heart has rejoiced with a fulness of 
joy during this conference. From the

first discourse delivered by President 
Smith, on Sunday morning:, right to 
the present time, I have felt the pres- 
ence of the Spirit of the Lord. I know 
that President Smith's words were in- 
spired by that Spirit, and our breth- 
ren who have addressed us have felt 
its influence, and it has been imparted 
from them to the congregation. 

I have not words to express the joy 
and gratitude which spring up in my 
besom in contemplating the goodness 
of G-od to me from my boyhood to 
the present time. When I first embrac- 
ed the Gospel I received a testimony of 
its truth. I received it from the 
Spirit that comes from on high. It 
entered into my soul, and bore witness 
to me in every part of my existence 
that God is the author of this work. As 
time has rolled on, and I have passed 
through many different circumstances 
in many different lands, and I think 
of how God has preserved me, direct- 
ed me, and enlightened me, and bless- 
ed my testimony to others, I praise 
Him this afternoon in the midst of the 
congregation. I feel in my heart, bless 
and praise the Lord, O my soul! He is 
my God. I revere and adore Him as 
my Father and my King, and I want to 
be obedient to him and to serve Him 
in all things. 

It does not matter where or how my 
labors may be directed, I desire them 
to be in the interest of this great work 
which our Father has commenced. This 
work cannot be overcome by the pow- 
ers of evil, nor by the powers of the 
world; neither will you or I as indi- 
viduals be so overcome if we will 
hearken to the testimonies which have 
been delivered to us, the instructions 
which are imparted, and be willing to 
be guided by that authority which has 
come down from God out of heaven in 
the last days for the guidance and 
salvation of the children of men. No 
feeling of rebellion should ever rise in 
our hearts; no word of reproach or 
improper criticism should escape our 
lips in regard to those men whom 
God has called and ordained, and whom 
we sustain by our uplifted hands when 
we assemble in conference. It would 
be a good thing if the thoughts of our 



minds and the words of our mouths 
were always directed for the interest 
and the furtherance of this great work 
that our Father has) begun. We 
ought not to speak a word anywhere 
which would militate against it, or 
against the men whom God has ap- 
pointed. 

I think sometimes of the words 
of the Apostle James in regard to the 
power of the tongue. What good can 
be accomplished by using the powers 
of speech in the proper direction! What 
wrong can be accomplished when these 
powers are prostituted to speak evil. 
"Thou shalt not speak evil of the 
Lord's anointed." I hope you recognize 
that saying. We are under promise 
that we will not do it. We should 
speak that which is good, not that 
which is evil. And we should hesitate 
when we find an opportunity, or when 
some circumstance arises which might 
induce us to say something that would 
be improper in regard to our brethren. 
James says: "The tongue is a fire, a 
world of iniquity," it "setteth on fire 
the course of nature; and it is set on 
fire of hell." We hear a great deal 
of talk among the Methodists about 
hell fire. If you want to know what 
hell fire is, just hear some angry wo- 
man when she is rattling that little 
red rag — the tongue. I mean the man 
as well; for I do not confine it to the 
sisters. I believe I have heard worse 
things from the mouths of men than 
from the lips of women. I do not con- 
fine it to the one sex. Perhaps it is 
"six of one and half a dozen of the 
other." 

We should be careful what we say. 
If we cannot say anything good, let 
us hold our tongues, and do as the 
mother sometimes roughly tells the 
children: "Shut your mouth." It is a 
good thing to be able to shut your 
mouth, and to keep it shut, when you 
ought not to talk; and it's a good thing 
to be able to ODen your mouth at the 
proper time ani at the proper season 
and bring forth words of eternal life 
for the blessing, enlightenment, com- 
fort, and consolation of the sons of 
men. When Christ spoke He spoke 
words of life. "My words that I speak 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



unto you, they are spirit and they 
are life," He said. And they were. 
He brought forth words of eternal life 
for the guidance and blessing of man- 
kind. "When He did rebuke, His words 
were sharp — sharper than a two-edged 
sword; but He didn't rebuke unless 
there was a proper occasion. He had 
authority and power to use words of 
rebuke as well as of comfort and of en- 
lightenment. Let us take care that 
when we speak we speak to good pur- 
pose, for light and for truth, and to 
comfort and bless humanity, not to 
speak evil of our brethren or of our 
sisters. This is very common advice, 
but I fear we "take advice" very often 
and do not put it to use. 

When I contemplate what God has 
done in the building up of this latter- 
day work to the present time, I feel 
full of joy and gladness. And these 
things are prophetic to me of the fu- 
ture. I know, as I know that I am 
here, that this work will go forward. 
It does not matter what men may do or 
say in regard to us; God is our Father 
and He is at the head of this work. He 
revealed it in the beginning. He placed 
His Son Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, 
at the head of this work, to conduct it 
from that time forward; and He has 
been with it to the present day. He is 
with our brethren who have been call- 
ed to stand at the head of affairs. His 
spirit rests upon them; His light is 
in their souls, and their words are 
inspired of Him. And He will con- 
tinue to be and abide with this work 
until it is perfected, and He can pre- 
sent it to the Father as an accomplish- 
ed and perfect work. But there is a 
great deal to do before that time shall 
come. This Gospel of the kingdom is 
to be preached in all the world as a 
witness to all nations. We should be 
glad when our sons, our brothers, our 
fathers, or any of our friends, are call- 
ed upon to go out into the world and 
lift up their voice in the proclamation 
of this last divine message to man. "We 
should rejoice in their labors, and be 
willing to make what we call sacrifices 
for their sake and for the sake of man- 
kind. Every man who holds the Priest- 
hood should be willing and glad to 



work anywhere in this kingdom for 
the salvation and redemption of the 
human family. This Gospel will be 
preached, no matter what laws may be 
enacted in the nations that are afar off. 
No matter what barriers may be raised 
for the time being, they will all be 
swept out of the way by the power of 
God, in His due time; and this Gospel 
will be preached, Israel will be gath- 
ered, temples will be reared and min- 
istrations will go on therein for the 
benefit of the living and the redemp- 
tion of the dead.* 

As our brethren finish their earthly 
work, and their bodies are laid down 
to rest for a while, to be purged in the 
tomb, they will go forth in the spirit, 
as Christ did, and as the Prophet 
Joseph and his brother Hyrum and the 
rest of the valiant servants have done, 
and publish the Gospel to the spirits 
that are behind the veil. A mighty 
work is going on there, and as our 
brethren depart hence and their places 
are taken up by their posterity, they 
will carry on this work in the spirit 
world, where there is a wider sphere 
for their operations than here in the 
flesh. And they will find that much 
of the seed that has been sown in mor- 
tality among the nations of the earth, 
which has not appeared to fructify, or 
to bring forth fruit (for many people 
have heard the word and have not 
obeyed it, but have gone down to the 
grave in their darkness) will come to 
life and light and power in the world 
behind the veil. Thousands upon 
tiiousands who have heard the Gospel, 
but have not obeyed it, will be ready 
to receive it when the servants of God 
present it to them in the spheres be- 
hind the veil. The work of God will be 
carried on there, and the work of the 
ordinances will be performed in this 
sphere, in the temples that are and 
will be erected. "We have only begun 
this great work, notwithstanding the 
many thousands of vicarious ordi- 
nances that have been performed. This 
work will go on. It is a mighty wo k, 
and you and I can be engaged in It. We 
should be glad to labor in any capacity 
and in any place where we can do 
something toward the building up of 



PRESIDENT JC 

the kingdom of God and the redemption 
of the human family. This work must 
go on until all nations and peoples an i 
tribes and tongues on the earth, behind 
the veil and wherever the sons and 
daughters of Adam are, have heard the 
sound of the Gospel and have had the 
opportunity of bowing in obedience to 
it. Until that is done this work cannot 
be consummated. It will go on, with 
Christ at the head, until every knee 
shall bow and every tongue confess 
that Jesus is the Lord, to the glory 
of God the Father. 

This is a work in which we should 
rejoice with all our souls, and be will- 
ing to labor in it wherever we may be 
directed by that authority that has 
come down from God. I rejoice in the 
work of God with all my heart. I 
have done so ever since I embraced it. 
I am willing today, as I have ever 
been, to go here or there and to labor 
in any direction. The man who is not 
willing to labor as a deacon is not fit 
to be a president. A man who will 
not work in a humble capacity is not 
fit to be exalted. The Lord will bless 
our labors in time and in eternity, and 
we will see the fruits thereof and re- 
joice in them in the presence of our 
Father. I know that the spirit which 
has been with us in this conference 
is the light of the Lord. It is the spirit 
that proceeds from the presence of God 
to lighten the souls of men. It is the 
light of Christ, the light and the life of 
the world, the power of the Lord. It 
comes from His presence; it fills our 
souls with joy and peace; it strength- 
ens us to resist the evils of the flesh 
and to overcome Satan and his works, 
and it will be and abide with this 
Church and grow brighter and brighter 
until the perfect day. 

I feel in my soul to bless and praise 
the Lord for His goodness to me. I 
bear testimony that this is His work, 
and I desire to labor in it in time and 
in eternity. I invoke upon you, my 
brethren and sisters, the blessing and 
peace of Cod. May the kingdom of God 
.go forth, as it will. Roll on, thou 
glorious kingdom of the latter-days! 
Spread wide thy light and thy power, 
and the kingdoms of this world shall 



1EPH F. SMITH. 73 

bend to it; the powers of darkness shall 
be rebuked, the clouds shall roll away, 
and the light and might of God shall 
increase in the earth until all things 
are subdued unto Him; and the earth 
itself shall be redeemed and shine in 
the glory of God, and Christ shall grace 
it with His presence and crown it with 
His glory. May God help us to be 
faithful and serve Him all our days 
and finally save us in His kingdom, 
for Christ's sake. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

A profitable and enjnyRl le Conferenc — Privileges 
of the ppot>le — I he Gospel incl'des temp rnl as 
well as spiritual salvation— Offirial statement 
sustained. 

I have been delighted throughout 
with the spirit of our Conference and 
with the instructions that have been 
given to us by those who have spoken. 
The Spirit of the Lord has been mani- 
fest through His servants who have 
addressed this Conference. I feel that 
we have had a precious time, and that 
the Lord has blessed us abundantly by 
the outpouring of His Spirit, by the 
beautiful weather we have had in the 
main, and by the glorious opportunity 
we have enjoyed of mingling together, 
of meeting many friends, of witnessing, 
by our presence here, our interest in the 
work of the Lord, and of taking part in 
the transaction of such business as may 
properly come before this Conference. 
It is well understood that we meet to- 
gether in general Conference twice a 
year for the purpose of presenting the 
names of those who have been chosen 
as presiding officers in the Church, and 
it is understood that those who occupy 
these positions are dependent upon the 
voice of the people for the continuance 
of the authority, the rights and privi- 
leges they exercise. The female mem- 
bers of this Church have tne same priv- 
ilege of voting to sustain their presid- 
ing officers as the male members of the 
Church, and the vote of a sister in good 
standing counts in every way equal 
with the vote of a brother. The presen- 
tation of the Church authorities is part 
of the duty that remains to be done be- 
fore this Conference is brought to a 
close. Other business will also be pre- 



74 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



sented to the Conference, which may 
be considered by some as of greater 
importance than the rest. We desire 
that the Latter-day Saints will exer- 
cise the liberty wherewith they have 
been made free by the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ; for they are entitled to know 
the right from the wrong-, to see the 
truth and draw the line between it and 
error; and it is their privilege to judge 
for themselves and to act upon their 
own free agency with regard to their 
choice as to sustaining or otherwise 
those who should exercise the presid- 
ing functions among them. We desire 
the Latter-day Saints at this Confer- 
ence to exercise their prerogative, which 
is, to vote as the Spirit of the Lord 
prompts them on the measures and the 
men that may be presented unto them. 

It is not my purpose to prolong re- 
marks. We are living in peculiar 
times. The situation in which we are 
placed calls for peculiar wisdom and 
understanding, and for the full exercise 
of our rights as Latter-day Saints, who 
should enjoy the spirit or discernment 
and inspiration that belong to those 
who are born of the water and the Spir- 
it, and who, because of this birth, are 
in a position to see the kingdom of 
heaven. 

At this point President Smith gave 
out notice of an important meeting of 
cattle and sheep men to be held in the 
city, and then spoke as follows: 

We may be pardoned for giving out 
a notice of this kind upon this occa- 
sion, but it will not be amiss for me 
to say that the Latter-day Saints be- 
lieve not only in the gospel of spiritual 
salvation, but also in the gospel of 
temporal salvation. We have to look 
after the cattle and the sheep and the 
horses, the gardens and the farms, the 
irrigation canals and ditches, and other 
necessary things for the maintenance of 
ourselves and our families in the earth. 
In this respect this Church is different 
from many other denominations. We do 
not feel that it is possible for men to 
be really good and faithful Christian 
people unless they can also be good, 
faithful, honest and industrious people. 
Therefore, we preach the gospel of in- 
dustry, the gospel of economy, the gos- 



pel of sobriety. We preach that the 
idler shall not eat the bread of the la- 
borer, and that the idler is not entitled 
to an inheritance in Zion. We preach 
that those who are industrious, those 
who work, those who through their in- 
tegrity and industry are good citizens 
of the kingdom of God, are better citi- 
zens of the country in which they live 
than those who are not so diligent in 
this regard. 

Let me. say to the brethren and sis- 
ters before we part: When you go 
home do not only be faithful in your 
prayers, in secret and in public; do not 
only be faithful as good church-goers; 
but be faithful to your families, be 
faithful to your flocks and to your 
herds, be faithful in the management 
of your farms, and in the promotion 
and conduct of every enterprise in 
which you are engaged. I would to the- 
Lord that we had a thousand good engi- 
neers, mechanics, surveyors and other 
skilled workmen among us. We could 
find employment today for hundreds of 
our people where honesty and faithful 
devotion to labor are demanded, if we 
only had the men who were skilled in 
the work that is required; but we do 
not have them. When we are applied 
to for men as boiler makers, as engi- 
neers, as builders, as skilled workmen 
in other directions, and we send out 
inquiries for them, we cannot find them. 
The boys are learning something else 
instead of the arts of laoor. I have 
heard it said that science is what we 
know, and art is what we know how 
to do.

PRESIDENT SMITH. 

Brethren and sisters. Of course you 
cannot help but have noticed that some 
of our brethren have been absent from 
us. I regret very much the absence of 
a number of the Apostles. We are 



all sorry that circumstances have pre- 
vented them from meeting with us. El- 
der John Henry Smith has been suf- 
fering for some time from inflamma- 
tory rheumatism and is still confined to 
his room. Elder George Teasdale re- 
ceived permisison to retire from active 
duty over two months ago, and when 
he left us was in feeble health. Elder 
Marriner W. Merrill has been prostrat- 
ed for some time in his home at Cache 
valley. These brethren have our sym- 
pathy and our prayers for their re- 
covery. I regret also the absence from 
this conference of Elders John W. Tay- 
lor and Matthias F. Cowley. 

Now I am going to present a matter 
to you that is unusual and I do it be- 
cause of a conviction which I feel that 
it is a proper thing for me to do. I 
have taken the liberty of having writ- 
ten down what I wish to present, in 
order that I may say to you the exact 
words which I would like to have con- 
veyed to your ears, that I may not be 
misunderstood or misquoted. I present 
this to the conference for your ac- 
tion: 

OFFICIAL STATEMENT. 

"Inasmuch as there are numerous re- 
ports in circulation that plural mar- 
riages have been entered into contrary 
to the official declaration of President 
Woodruff, of September 26, 1890, com- 
monly called the Manifesto, which was 
issued by President Woodruff and 
adopted by the Church at its ganeral 
conference, October 6, 1890, which for- 
bade any marriages violative of the law 
of the land; I, Joseph F. Smith, Presi- 
dent of the Church of Jesus Christ oi 
Latter-day Saints, hereby affirm and 
declare that no such marriages have 
been solemnized with the sanction, con- 
sent or knowledge of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 

"I hereby announce that all such 
marriages are prohibited, and if any 
officer or member of the Church shalV 
assume to solemnize or enter into any 
such marriage he will be deem°d in 
transgression against the Church and 
will be liable to be dealt with, according 
to the rules and regulations thereof, and 
excommunicated therefrom. 

"JOSEPH F. SMITH, 
"President of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

They charge us with being dishonest 
and untrue to our word. They charge 
the Church with having violated a 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"compact," and all this sort of non- 
sense. I -want to see today whether 
the Latter-day Saints representing the 
Church in this solemn assembly will 
not seal these charges as false by their 
vote. 

President Francis M. Lyman pre- 
sented the following resolution and 
moved its adoption: 

RESOLUTION OF ENDORSEMENT. 

"Resolved that we, the members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, in General Conference as- 
sembled, hereby approve and endorse 
the statement and declaration of Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, just made to this 
Conference concerning plural mar- 
riages, and will support the courts of 
the Church in the enforcement there- 
of." 

The resolution was seconded by a 
number of Presidents of Stakes and 
prominent Elders. Elder B. H. Roberts, 
in seconding the resolution, spoke as 
follows: 

"In seconding the resolution that has 
just been read — which I most heartily 
do — I desire to state at least one reason 
for doing it. As remarked by the 
president, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints has been accused 
of being covenant-breakers with this 
nation. Of course, there never was, and 
could not be, any compact between the 
Church and the general government 
of the United States. But there could 
be a compact between the State . of 
Utah and the United States, and there 
was such a compact made in the Con- 
stitution of our state, by and through 
the Constitutional Convention. And 
now I am pleased with the opportunity 
of the Church saying in its official ca- 
pacity that the Latter-day Saints not 
only now are, but have been, true to 
the compact between the State of Utah 
and the United States., and that they 
are true to the Constitution of the 
state, which, by express provision, for- 
. ever prohibited plural or polygamous 
marriages, and made that irrevocable, 
without the consent of the United 
States. The adoption bv the Church 
of this resolution should put to sil- 
ence those who have accused us of be- 
ing covenant-breakers." 

The resolution was then adopted, by 
unanimous vote of the Conference. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

This statement which has just been 
read in your hearing was made for the 
Church. Rumors have been afloat that 
plural marriages have taken place, and 



some are said to have commenced to 
doubt the truth of the declaration 
made by our President at Washington. 
Now it has been laid before you, and 
the Church, by its vote in solemn as- 
sembly, has ratified this resolution, and 
the Saints know just where the Church 
stands on this question. If any come to 
you with such rumors, you know that 
the Church is true to that which it ac- 
cepted thirteen years and six months 
ago, and which it has again ratified 
here in this Conference. It is not a new 
manifesto. It simply shows where we 
stand as a Church. The Lord has in- 
stituted in this Church the principle of 
free agency. Everything must be done 
by common consent, and therefore we 
lay these things before the conferences, 
that the people may have an opportu- 
nity to vote thereupon. This is an im- 
portant matter, and should be known 
by the world that the Latter-day Saints 
have the right and privilege to vote up- 
on everything that shall be accepted as 
Church doctrine or in regard to church 
government. 

I feel pleased with our conference, 
with the spirit thereof, and with the in- 
structions that have been given. Let 
us take what we have heard home with 
us; let us take the spirit of the con- 
ference with us, and try to carry out in 
our daily lives the good counsel which 
has been given us. May the Lord 
bless you, brethren and sisters, and 
bless His Church upon the earth, as 
well as all good people and all who love 
the truth, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Jo-' ph and H\rum Men Tim 

President Lund has expressed my 
feelings exactly in regard to this resolu- 
tion. I am proud to have the opportu- 
nity of voting for it. 

There is one more item of business that 
I want to lay before the Conference, in 
which I think we are all greatly inter- 
ested, and I have no doubt you will sus- 
tain the proposition when you hear it. 
It is almost sixty years now since the 
martyrdom of the Prophet and Patri- 
arch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and 
until this day no building or monu- 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 



77 



ment has been erected to their mem- 
ory. This matter has been talked over 
many times, and several propositions 
have been made. At one time it was 
suggested that a building be erected on 
the old Deseret News corner, which 
should be called a memorial building. 
At least one other suggestion has been 
made, that a monument or a memorial 
building should be erected on the 
southeast corner of this block. No defi- 
nite place, as yet, has been fixed for it. 
But I have been impressed that the 
time has come when some steps should 
be taken with regard to this matter. I 
would like to see a building, or monu- 
ments, or statues, erected in honor of 
these martyrs that would be something 
for our children to look at in years to 
come. Opposite the southeast corner of 
this block we have erected a monu- 
ment to President Brigham Young, and 
I would like to see something erected 
to these martyrs that would be an ob- 
ject lesson to our children and our chil- 
dren's children throughout all genera- 
tions, and also to the thousands of peo- 
ple who visit us, that they too may 
have something of this kind to look at. 
Therefore, I am strongly in favor of do- 
ing something to perpetuate the mem- 
ory of the Prophet and Patriarch, and 
with this in view I have prepared a 
resolution, which I will read to you: 

"Whereas nearly sixty years have 
passed since the martyrdom of the Pro- 
phet and Patriarch Joseph and Hyrum 
Smith, and no public building or monu- 



ment has been erected to their memory; 

"Therefore, Be it Resolved by this 
General Conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, That 
a suitable building or monument be 
erected to their memory; that the Trus- 
tee-in-Trust appoint a committee to 
prepare plans for the same, which shall 
be submitted to him, and when ap- 
proved he will authorize the committee 
to proceed with the work and will fur- 
nish the necessary means from such 
funds as may be available for that pur- 
pose, and that a book be opened at the 
Presiding Bishop's Office to receive vol- 
untary subscriptions from any who 
wish to donate." 

After reading the resolution, Presi- 
dent Winder moved its adoption. 

It was seconded by President Francis 
M. Lyman and a number of others, and 
was adopted by the conference without 
a dissenting vote. 

President Smith named as the com- 
mittee President John R. Winder, chair- 
man; President Francis M. Lyman, 
Bishop Wm. B. Preston and Bishop 
George Romney, and they were unani- 
mously sustained by the conference. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

"Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah." 

Benediction by Elder John Nicholson. 
The conference then adjourned for 
six months. 

The stenographic work in taking an 
account of the proceedings was done 
by Arthur Winter. 

JOHN NICHOLSON, 
Clerk of Conference. 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



Its Semi-Annual Conference, Held in the Tabernacle, 
Sunday Evening. October 3. 1904. 



The general semi-annual conference 
of the Sunday Schools of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, 
Sunday, April 3, 1904, at 7 o'clock p. 
m. 

General Superintendent Joseph F. 
Smith presided. 

There were present of the general au- 
thorities: Presidents Joseph F. Smith 
and Anthon H. Lund; Elders Francis 
M. Lyman, Abraham O. Woodruff, 
Rudger Clawson, Hyrum M. Smith, 
George A. Smith of the Quorum of the 
Apostles; Patriarch John Smith; a ma- 
jority of the Deseret Sunday School 
Union Board. The Tabernacle was 
crowded with an enthusiastic audience 
of Sunday School workers and Saints. 

The congregation, under the leader- 
ship of Prof. Evan Stephens, sang "If 
There's Sunshine in your Heart." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Abraham 
O. Woodruff. 

The song, "Peace, be Still" was then 
sung by the Granite Stake adult class, 
under the direction of Prof. Evan 
Stephens. 

Secretary Geo. D. Pyper called the 
roll of stakes which showed a represen- 
tation from every stake of Zion and 
three missions. 

The secretary presented the officers 
of the Deseret Sunday School Union, 
who were sustained as follows: Gen- 
eral superintendent, Joseph F. Smith; 
first assistant general superintendent, 
George Reynolds; second assistant gen- 
eral superintendent, Joseph M. Tanner. 
Members of the board: Elders Joseph 
F. Smith, George Reynolds, Joseph M. 
Tanner, Joseph W. Summerhays, Levi

J. Grant, George Teasdale, Hugh J. 



Cannon, Andrew Kimball, John W. 
Taylor, L. John Nuttall, James W. Ure, 
John F. Bennett, John M. Mills, Wil- 
liam D. Owen, Seymour B. Young, 
George D. Pyper, Henry Peterson, An- 
thon H. Lund, John R. Winder, Jas. E.

urer, George Reynolds; business man- 
ager and assistant general secretary,

structor, Joseph F. Smith; assistant ed- 
itors, George Reynolds and Joseph M. 
Tanner; business manager, George D. 
Pyper. 

Miss Margaret Summerhays, Noel 
Pratt and Wood Pratt of Granite Stake 
then sang the trio, "O Restless Sea." 

Elder William D. Owen of the Deseret 
Sunday School Union board then read 
an editorial from the Juvenile Instruc- 
tor of Jan. 1, 1904, on the subject of 
''Harmony between presiding authori- 
ties in the Priesthood and in anxiliary 
organizations." 

The choir sang, "Rouse, O ye Mor- 
tals." 

JOSEPH W. SUMMERHAYS. 
I am requested to make a few re- 
marks and a short report on the fea- 
tures of our Sunday School work for 
1904, viz., district Sunday School conven- 
tions. 

We have already held three of these 
district conventions, one in Salt Lake 
City, comprising Tooele, Salt Lake, Da- 
vis, Granite and Jordan stakes; one in 
Weber, comprising Weber, Summit, 
Morgan and Box Elder stakes; and an- 
other in Provo, taking in the Utah, Al- 
pine, Nebo, Wasatch and Juab stakes. 
And in all of these conventions we have 
had a most glorious time. 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



79 



In behalf of the Sunday School Board, 
we can say that every one of them was 
a grand success. 

The work in these conventions is al- 
together different to what is done in our 
Stake conferences. In the conventions, 
after the general opening exercises, 
we take up department work, dividing 
the convention into some eight depart- 
ments. We will take, for instance, the 
theological department. We get the 
department workers and teachers and 
all interested in the theological depart- 
ments of the various schools, together; 
and there we read and discuss papers 
on different topics. And we have found 
that great good has resulted from these 
conventions, one of the greatest advan- 
tages being that every one attending 
has gone away from them to their re- 
spective homes with a greater deter- 
mination to do their duty as Sunday 
School people. 

Now it is proposed that we 
hold like conventions throughout 
all the Stakes. We intend to district 
the Stakes into suitable convention dis- 
tricts, and during this summer, and 
perhaps early fall, we will visit each 
one of the districts and hold a conven- 
tion. When I say "we," I mean the 
general board of the Sunday School 
Union. 

That we may be better able to dis- 
trict the various stakes, we will hold a 
meeting in the Barratt hall .next Tues- 
day afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, where we 
hope to meet with the superintendents 
of each stake, together with their as- 
sistants; and if the stake superintend- 
ents and their assistants are not pres- 
ent at this conference, from any of the 
stakes, we would like some representa- 
tive. We understand that some of the 
stakes of Zion are represented here 
tonight by their secretaries and other 
persons, and we would like the meeting 
next Tuesday afternoon to have a rep- 
resentation from each stake, so that we 
can make the districting as complete 
as possible. We are sure, my brethren, 
that much good will result if you will 
attend and help us. 

I think this fairly represents the sit- 
uation, and it is not necessary to en- 



large upon it. May God bless us and 
help us to do His will, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder George Hamlin then recited, 
"New Century Sonnets." 

The Juvenile choir of the Granite 
Stake sang, 

"Let us all press on in the work of 
the Lord." 

Prof. Evan Stephens, in explaining 
methods in teaching the little ones, 
comprising this choir, and also the 
youths that constituted the choir that 
rendered the previous exercises of the 
evening, stated that those present con- 
stituted but about one-half of the full 
classes from which they were taken. 
They had received lessons only since 
about the first of the year, one lesson 
per week, to which they had come 
through mud and slush, in various 
kinds of weather. He thought they 
were a fair representation of the class- 
es, and showed what might readily be 
done in other rural stakes of Zion, out- 
side of the cities, by those who were 
willing and able to work in this direc- 
tion. He stated that about one dozen 
earnest active workers, who had taken 
an excellent course in the Chorister's 
class in the Latter-day Saints' Univer- 
sity, were about to return to their vari- 
ous homes in the several stakes, and 
these should be given work in this line 
of most profitable service to our young 
people. He said, further: 

"We are aiming, with the smaller peo- 
ple, to teach them songs that will ap- 
peal strongly to them from the stand- 
point of sentiment. The "Cause of 
Truth" is not taken hit or miss, but 
with an aim. Another song we sing is 
"Have Courage, My Boy, to say No." 
That also tells its own story. The other 
one, to be given this evening, is "Whis- 
pering Hope." Outside of the senti- 
ment, we try to teach them to sing 
parts, that is, to learn to harmonize at 
once in part singing, and in this all the 
class is taught to sing alto, and all the 
class is taught to sing treble. I want 
to say this, that children should not be 
kept singing one part alone. In order 
to develop our little ones as they ought

to be developed, they should sing alto 
and treble alternately, so that the voice 
•will have proper practice through the 
whole range from the top to the bottom, 
and for this reason we do not select 
certain ones for altos, for they are all 
altos and all trebles; and we hope that 
as soon as they have grown up, there 
will be no need of training them into 
the singing of parts for they have 
grown up to it. Some have complained 
about the little boys being allowed to 
sing too high. We have some here 
singing up to what we call high G. I 
claim there is no danger in having 
them sing high, provided they are 
taught to sing softly. 

For the purpose of exhibiting his 
method, Prof. Stephens had all the 
choir sing alto the first verse, the sec- 
ond verse all sang treble, and the third 
verse, the north half sang treble and 
the south half all sang alto. In the 
piece, rendered later in the exercises, 
he had the reverse sides sing alto and 
treble. 

PRESIDENT F. M. LYMAN. 

The exercises of the children from 
Granite stake, in their singing, is quite 
a surprise to me, and a delight. I have 
no doubt the musical people connected 
with the Sunday Schools throughout 
Zion will profit by the example set us 
tonight, so that the talents of the young 
people may be utilized to the very best 
advantage. We are wonderfully blessed 
with talent in this line throughout the 
Church, and we have not only the tal- 
ent, but we have the love and appre- 
ciation also of the labors of such men 
as Professor Stephens, and we are very 
anxious — I am sure the General Board 
is very anxious — that all may be made 
that can be made of the musical talent 
with which the Lord has blessed His 
people; for singing, and good singing 
particularly, is heavenly. 

There is hardly any soul so dull or in- 
different as to not appreciate choice 
singing. The world delights in it, as 
well as the Saints. It is an accom- 
plishment that will adorn the Latter- 
day Saints throughout the world, and I 
have no doubt but that we shall excel 



in it as one of the important features 
of the Sunday School cause. I have 
felt that our Sunday School work is 
superior, possibly, to that accomplished 
by any other people. We are not a 
very numerous people, but the Sunday 
School work that has been organized 
and developed within the last 40 years 
produces what we see here tonight. 
Nothing like this is to be seen in the 
world so far as I know; such a body, 
of possibly eight to nine thousand peo- 
ple, gathered together here, interest- 
ed in the Sunday School cause, workers 
and pupils, a whole commuunity, their 
hearts beating warmly towards this 
cause. In it, by these associations and 
organizations, the spirit of the Gospel 
is cultivated. Music is refining; and it 
is introduced into the homes, until we 
find that in every home in Zion, wheth- 
er there be musical instruments or not, 
but the voices will be trained, and our 
children will be singers, the musical 
talent will be developed delightfully; 
and what is more pleasant than to hear 
children sing, singly and also collective- 
ly? What is there more cheerful in a 
home and in our social gatherings? I 
know of nothing that cheers the heart 
and elevates the sentiment of the soul 
of men or women equal to the musical 
sentiment and talent, if it is cultivated. 
How pleasant it is, where we have a 
mother who can sing, a father who 
can sing, brothers that can sing, sisters 
that can sing! I think we cannot de- 
vote too much attention and time to 
the cultivation of the musical talent 
with which the Lord has endowed us. 
I appreciate that the Sunday School is 
developing this art more extensively 
and generally throughout our communi- 
ties, until the Latter-day Saints will 
be recognized as the musical people of 
the world, the most 'remarkable com- 
munity for musical talent; and the 
world will be delighted, as they are 
now. They come to us, and we go 
to them with our music. The Taber- 
nacle choir, under the direction of Prof. 
Stephens, has made a sensation 
throughout the United States, and it 
is anticipated that they will do so be- 
yond the bounds of the United States.

I hope they will. And I hope that the 
Lord will bless Prof. Stephens, and bless 
those who follow in his footsteps, and 
take up the labor that he has sug- 
gested now, and that has been taken 
up, for there are many among us, many 
others. Prof. Stephens is not the only 
one. He has possibly been the leading 
feature or factor in this line, but there 
are others whose hearts and souls arc 
just as musical as is Brother Stephens' 
heart and soul, and we want to avail 
ourselves of the talent that we have 
and accomplish everything that can bo 
done to produce joy in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. I do not feel that I ought to 
occupy your time. But may the Lord 
bless you and may we sustain and en- 
courage our young children and those 
who have musical talents to develop 
those talents until we shall rejoice ex- 
ceedingly in it before the Lord. I am 
sure that the Lord is pleased with this 
effort and labor; I am sure that the 
Lord is pleased with the General Sun- 
day School board and with the labors 
of the people, I am sure that He re- 
joices therein, and the angels will be 
delighted with the music that will be 
made by the children of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

May that spirit and inclination in- 
crease in our hearts, now and forever. 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The Juvenile choir of the Granite 
Stake then sang, 

"Have Courage, my boy, to say No." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Observing this choir of children, it 
would not appear that Zion is growing 
less, and it would seem to me, too, that 
so long as we can preserve with us Bro- 
ther Stephens and a few others of his 
associates who are engaged in this 
glorious work of teaching music, both 
to the adults and to the children, a de- 
sire and love for the musical will also 
increase in the midst of our people. I 
feel that the parents of these little chil- 
dren owe much to the effort of Brother 
Stephens in his labor of love, in teach- 
ing them how to sing and developing 



81 

the talent for music which lies dormant 
within them and needs but the in- 
struction, the teaching.the guiding hand 
and voice of Brother Stepnens to devel- 
op the talent that they have. 

It delights my heart to see our little 
children learning to sing, and to see thf. 
people, our neoole everywhere, improv- 
ing their talenis as gcod singers. Every- 
where we go among our people, we find 
sweet voices and talent for music. I 
believe that this is a manifestation to 
us of the purpose of the Lord in this 
direction toward our people, that they 
will excel in these things, as they 
should excel in every other good thing. 

I do not arise to make any special 
remarks. I feel gratified at seeing this 
vast concourse of people here this eve- 
ning, interested in this Sunday School 
work, and I hope, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that you and all of us may con- 
tinue to keep awake our interest in the 
Sunday School cause. It is a very im- 
portant branch of our spiritual work, 
the training of our little ones, the 
training of our Sunday School children 
and all parents should take a deep in- 
terest in this work, and should not 
spare any pains in making ready and in 
giving encouragement to their children 
to attend the Sunday schools. 

God bless you as teachers and as 
Latter-day Saints, as fathers and as 
mothers of these precious little chil- 
dren who have been given to us to 
succeed us, eventually, in the great 
labor of building up Zion in the lat- 
ter-day. Bring them up in the way 
that they should go that they will not 
depart from that way when th?y g ow 
old; and if you will only see to it care- 
fully that your children are ta' ght in 
the ways of righteousness, that they 
are brought up in the paths of vir- 
tue and peace and honor, God will 
magnify you before the nations of the 
world, and His work will be hastened 
in its time. 

God bless you and all who are as- 
sociated in the work of the Sabbath 
schools, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 
I am pleased to see this large con-

gregation, all interested in the good 
work of the Sunday school. 

I believe that all have been pleased 
who have been here this evening to 
witness what we have seen Brother 
Stephens do with his choir. We sang, 
"If there's sunshine in the heart." "We 
want to put sunshine into the hearts 
of our children. Our Sunday School 
is a splendid place for this, and by 
teaching our children singing we will 
do one part toward it, but especially 
by the good teaching that is given. In 
the Sunday School we lay the founda- 
tion for our children to always be in 
a condition that they may have sun- 
shine in their hearts. We want to in- 
stil in their hearts and lives a love for 



the beautiful, a love for music and 
everything that tends to elevate. This 
is the good work in which you, breth- 
ren and sisters, are engaged. 

May the Lord prosper you in your 
work, give you much joy therein, and 
may you see the children of Zion grow 
up strong in faith and in the love of 
God, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The children's choir of the Granite 
stake then sang, "Whispering Hope."

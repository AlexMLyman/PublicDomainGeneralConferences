Causes of the unity of the Saints— Necessity for continuous faithfulness to God— An admonition to the people. 

It is about three years since I stood before so large a congregation. During that time I have been abroad, and have always felt that we were greatly favored when we could meet from one hundred to six hundred people. I greatly desire your sympathy, your faith and prayers, and the blessing of the Spirit of the Lord. If the Lord speaks through me, I am sure I shall be edified in speaking and you will be in listening. I greatly enjoyed the measure of the Spirit given to our brethren this morning, and the word of the Lord that we listened to through them. I feel disposed to read to you a few words uttered by the Savior on the occasion of His first visit to the people of Nephi. They are to be found in the eleventh chapter of III Nephi, in the Book of Mormon: 

"And the Lord commanded him (Nephi) that he should arise. And he arose and stood before them. "And the Lord said unto him, I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven. 

"And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them, On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you. 

"Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them; behold, ye shall go> down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them. 

"And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying, 

"Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

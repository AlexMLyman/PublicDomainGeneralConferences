President Joseph F. Smith. 

I don't want Brother Lyman to think he has the last silk handkerchief; (laughter) I have a number of them at home, which I intend to keep as long as I can. 

There is a very modest lady in the congregation, who is clothed in home-made silk. The mulberry leaves were grown here, and the very worms that spun the silk into threads, were bred in Utah. I wish that more of the good sisters were clad in home-made silk. 

A quartette, "The Floweret's Sleep," was rendered by Elders Siddoway, Winter, Robinson, and Peterson." 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

More care needed in the cultivation of the soil. — Beautifying of towns and villages. — Brethren advised to purchase land and to make homes in the vales of Utah. — Idleness discountenanced, Industry encouraged. — Praise for Utah and her peopleParents exhorted to safeguard their offspring. — Home Industries recommended. 

I have enjoyed very much, indeed, the remarks that have been made by all of the brethren who have spoken to us in our conference today. The instructions and advice they have given us, on the various themes that have been dwelt upon, should encourage us in the more faithful discharge of the duties that rest upon us. 

The closing suggestions presented by President Lyman, in which he called our attention to the fact that there is a considerable growth of weeds throughout the land, is a matter upon which 1 believe, as a , we require something of an awakening. It has been my privilege, in recent times, to attend quite a number of congresses that have been held in various sections of the country. There was a time, in my earlier mingling in these congresses, when Utah was most constantly and frequently quoted as an example to her sister states and territories, in the character of her productions, and the results of our irrigation system. But, I am sorry to say, that in more recent times, we are not quoted so frequently, if at all, in regard to these matters. 

Many of our neighbors have taken steps in advance of us, and much greater care is being bestowed upon the productions of the soil than has been the case with ourselves. I believe that an awakening is necessary concerning the products of our farms; that an awakening of great moment is necessary in the upbuilding of our villages and towns, in the bestowal of greater care, more thought and industry on the beautifying of them. I am sanguine that it is necessary for an upward and onward movement to take place among the Latter-day Saints, looking to the accomplishment of this matter. I note, in many of the villages where it is my privilege to go, that there is not enough evidence of attention and labor and taste in the building of the cottage homes, in the selection of their position upon the lots, in the improvement of the sidewalks in front of the homes, in the planting of shade trees, in regular form. In thousands of the orchards of this country, peach trees and apple trees are gradually growing so old and looking so dead, that the condition of the neighborhood is to be regretted. I believe it would be a most wise effort upon the part of the presidency of each stake of Zion, backed by their high councils, the bishop's of their wards, and the leading elders of their sections, to look into and seek to improve the conditions of our villages. In the erection of cottage homes, the buildings should be put a sufficient distance from the sidewalk, so that the ground in front can be improved, that flower gardens may be made to grow up around the homes. If it were possible it would be well to secure the labors, in each district, of some young man who has a taste for architecture, in the drawing up of small plans, or plans that would reach the means of the now marrying young men and women of our communities; that in the laying of their home foundations, it would be upon a basis that would afford opportunity for culture and improvement, and would awaken in the minds of the young men and women of our communities an ambition to make the spot that they purpose to occupy the most pleasing and satisfactory upon which it would be possible for them to live. 

I believe there should also be an awakening in our own minds in regard to the securing of lands that are within our reach, that are within the confines of our own states and neighborhoods. We need an awaking that will check the tendency to wander afar off, to virtually pass around the circle — leaving Salt Lake, going to the southland, into Mexico; stopping a short time, possibly, in Arizona, in New Mexico, in old Mexico, then proceeding into Colorado, thence into Wyoming, thence into Canada; remaining in Canada a few months, or a year or so, then making a break for Oregon, from Oregon into northern 

California; and eventually dropping down, possibly, into southern California; becoming dissatisfied with conditions in that section of the country, and wandering back into the vales of Utah. As I have travled in the discharge of my duty, in the preaching of the Gospel, I have found men who, with their families, had been living in almost every state and territory of the western part of the United States, as well as in Canada and Mexico; dragging their families "from pillar to post," living almost constantly in wagons. Many such have died without a home over the heads of their children. 

I recognize that there is something essential, in regard to this matter, in the development and improvement of this God-given land. No choicer locations can be found upon the globe than are found beneath the shades of these grand old mountains. No finer opportunities can be found, in which men can secure the comforts and blessings of life, than can be found within the confines of this state — this pioneer state of the western lands. It is not creditable to us that there should have existed so much of this changing and moving, this unsettled feeling that has caused some men to move about till they have lived in almost every state and territory of the western part of this republic. Some such have returned to their former homes almost naked, and, at an advanced time of their lives, been compelled, possibly, to go out upon the streets and engage in digging and toiling, when their frames are bent with age. I believe that the effort should be made, devotedly and earnestly, and with unyielding courage, to uplift and upbuild this state, that it may be main in the vanguard, and merit the honor and continued respect of our neighbors, who have looked to us in the past and recognized our worth as colonizers and builders of commonwealths. 

The suggestions and views expressed in the remarks of President Lyman, along the line of giving employment to the children, and keeping them in touch with an industrious and prudent life, should be remembered by every father and mother. They should carefully weigh these matters, and lay their plans in accordance therewith. That old saying, "An idle brain is the devil's workshop," is as true now as when it was first uttered. No man that is idle can be honest and virtuous and of use in the community. No woman that is an idler can be clean and sweet. No boy or girl left without employment "can, by any manner of means, make a mark in life or accomplish good for himself or herself. Wherever they are found in idleness, simply employing themselves briefly, for a few moments, possibly,.each day, putting on the clothes they may have, and then wandering the streets, they will, in a very brief period of time, be found with the mark of evil upon their faces. Therefore, we should make every effort that is possible for us to make in safeguarding, training and providing suitable employment for our children. Every father and every mother among us should be devoting considerable of his and her talents to the establishing of something that will keep the hands of their children fully engaged. How easily and how nicely, nearly every home within the confines of this state could be made desirable by the labor of the boys and girls at home — in the making of a flow-garden, in the cultivation of the trees, in the care of the side-walk in front of the house, in improving the fence, and in working out plans that would bring results in the general improvement of the home. The idle hours that are spent, upon every hand, would make each farm within the confines of the state of Utah a garden spot. 

There are some men whose lives of toil are continuous, but there are many whose lives are comparatively idle, and the result of that idleness goes far to overturn and destroy the effects of the industry of the prudent and thoughtful ones. The honey-bee and the bee-hive were taken to designate the character of the people who established themselves in these -mountains in that earlier day. Are the sons and the daughters of those honored pioneers worthy today of that ancestry? Are the boys as inJustrious, as prudent, as frugal, as determined, and as thorough, as a rule, as their fathers were? Are the daughters of our communities as fully alive to the accomplishment of their life mission, legitimately and properly, as many or most of their mothers were? These are questions that we must consider. In no sense of the word do I desire to reflect upon the honor and integrity, the worth, the industry and devotion of the people of communities I love, and with whom it has been my privilege to spend my life; but when, in my experiences among men from afar, whose voices are heard in commendation of the grand work of the pioneers of this people, I note their criticism of conditions today, I realize that there is need for improvement among us. Some of these men visit our communities, and upon leaving they say : "In some localities the canals are filled with weeds; the orchards are old; dead trees are seen; the fruits are wormy and unfit for use; the farms are without legitimate and proper cultivation; the evidences of lack of thrift, push, and industry are seen upon the right hand and upon the left. The prestige of the past is waning, speaking of your communities." Such remarks have been made to me by men who have passed through some sections of our country. Some sections are doing fairly well in producing fruits. Other sections are holding their own in producing potatoes; but there was a time when all Utah potatoes commanded the best prices everywhere in the land, and were looked upon as a luxury. "But now some of the neighbors of Utah are taking away from us the opportunities that were ours, in this field, advantages which were gained by those who entered in the start, and to which we had acquired a right in the estimation of many people. 

I have an especial pride in the development of this goodly land. I recognize the Bee Hive State as the best in the world; her sons and daughters are among the most industrious, the most unflinching and determined of men and women in the accomplishment of the responsibilities and duties of life. As a rule, their homes are homes of peace, and of love and comfort. Around them are the evidences of thrift and worth, in every detail; whether in the garden, or on the farm, or in the orchard; whether in the character of the stock that they possess, in the nature of their buildings, or in the care they bestow in the development and improvement of their public places, and erection of good schoolhouses and good meeting. In all these they are examples to the boys and girls in their respective districts, examples that shall lead the youth to active and determined purpose in the betterment and improvement of the community, and above all in the development of such manhood and womanhood that, wherever found in the world, the Mormon boys and girls shall be recognized for their moral virtues, their devotion, their faith, their determination to aid in the advancement and uplifting of mankind. Our young people should be so trained and taught that they may be free from that condition which affects many of our religious friends in the world, moving "from pillar to post," so far as religious faith is concerned. I trust that they will not be anxious to change and move about constantly, but that they will secure some permanent abiding place, lay a foundation and build upon it in a manner that shall be creditable to them in the fullest sense of the word. 

My brothers and sisters, the admonitions that have been given to you by the brethren are worthy of your serious consideration. Our boys and girls are among the brightest and best that can be found. Their improvement and advancement is necessary, that not one of them may stray from the paths of right and of rectitude. We preach the Gospel unto them, but too often it happens with us that our confidence in them is greater than it should be. Those of you who have been students will remember how strictly the people of the Latin races guard their homes. Their girls are never allowed that liberty that is found among people of other races; they exercise great thoughtfulness and prudence in this matter. 

I am satisfied that the degree of liberty, that is gradually increasing among us in regard to these matters is likely to give us, in due time, very great regrets. We should wisely guard our children, as far as it is possible for us to do so, that the proper development of those that are entrusted to us may not be hampered, but that they may be rightly guarded and instructed, that heartaches may not come to us and our homes, through our overconfidence and neglect, as suggested in the remarks of President Smith, this morning., 

To us has been given the grandest religious system in the world. To us has been given the greatest hopes that have ever been presented to mortals — the possibilties of eternal companionship, the association of husbands and wives, parents and children, in the eternities, based upon the laws of God, the laws of life, of morality, of temperance. Ours is a system based upon the proposition of industrious, thoughtful and prudent conduct, based upon continued and industrious effort upon our part to seek to bring those that may be entrusted to our watchcare, to an understanding of all that is good. 

I want to indorse every sentiment that has been expressed looking to improvement in the establishment of industries, in the development of resources, in the opening of every door to the utilization of every good business enterprise that comes within our reach. I look around, upon the right hand and the left, I note that our friends, not of our faith, are gradually moving along the lines of the securing of the business concerns of our country; and I ask myself the question, Are we lacking in business tact, in skill, in in, in perseverence, in the understanding of business, as compared with our neighbors, that their success and our failure should be so manifest? I ask the men who are under the sound of my voice, and our sisters as well, to look into these problems of the development of business interests, and secure to themselves a part in the coming tide of prosperity, in the development of some business that shall be a credit to themselves, and upon which their children may continue to build after them. 

May the Lord bless and prosper the honorable and the good, those who seek the uplifting and betterment of their kind, of all creeds and conditions. May that spirit spread, which was so manifest in the utterances of that grand man who, as President of the United States, stood on this stand, a few days ago, and made an appeal to his countrymen, that they cease their bickerings; that they love their country; that they seek its improvement and its advancement; that they maintain the law in honor; that they guide themselves in keeping with the principles of righteousness; that they honor the Lord their God; that they honor their country; that they honor each other's rights, and strive to uplift and make better the condition of their fellowmen. That was his spirit, and these were the sentiments that fell from his lips as he stood here, and they were, I believe, a joy to every right thinking man and woman under the sound of his voice, as he made that appeal to his fellowmen. 

That the Lord may inspire us with determination to be among the foremost in righteous works; and finally, when our missions are done, that we may be crowned. with everlasting life, in. the kingdom of our God, is my prayer, Amen.

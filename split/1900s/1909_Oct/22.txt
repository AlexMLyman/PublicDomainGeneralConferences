Patriarch John Smith. 

My brethren and sisters : I am pleased to be with you on this occasion. I always feel best when in the line and discharge of duty, but it is with peculiar feelings that I stand before you here today, because, as I have said so often, preaching is not my forte. 

I bear testimony that I have listened attentively to all that has been said during the conference thus far, and I can indorse every word that has been uttered. I ask God our Father to let His blessings rest upon us, His people; that we may profit by what we have learned during this conference; that when we return to our homes we shall go in peace, remembering the instructions and striving diligently to carry out the same; that we may live according to the laws of our heavenly ^ather and keep His commandments, that we may be worthy of lis blessings. 

All Latter-day Saints have certain duties to perform; and, in so doing, if they will follow the promptings of that still small voice, they will never err in their judgments, but will be able to fulfill their missions in that way and manner that shall be pleasing to our heavenly Father. 

I ask God that His blessings may rest upon us, that He may guide us  the true path, qualify us for every duty, that when we have finished our course here we may be worthy of the blessings which He has promised us, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

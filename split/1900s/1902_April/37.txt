President Anthon H. Lund. 

I congratulate the congregation on the good order which has been kept here tonight. 

I have been pleased to see such a large attendance of Sunday school workers. I hope that you will remember the excellent lesson President Smith gave us. If you want influence over the children you must reach their hearts. While we desire them taught in the principles of the Gospel, and wish them to obtain knowledge, still we want to reach their hearts; and instil in them a love for virtue. We want to make them see the beauty of virtue and to make them love it. We want to make them understand how odious vice is, and teach them to detest it. That is the great mission we have to perform every Sunday morning, when we meet with our precious little ones. Make the school attractive; gather all that can attend into a school and try to get their love, as our President has counseled us tonight. 

May the Lord bless you in the good work in which you are engaged. 

I also feel to thank the Tabernacle choir for their presence here and their beautiful singing. I would say let our Sunday school children learn singing. When they grow up, the boys especially, and become missionaries, what a blessing it is to them to be able to sing. DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 

I was struck when I read the statement in the Juvenile that our songs are being sung amongst the children of the outsiders in Germany, through the presence and labors of our Sunday schools. When our Sunday school children learn to sing the songs of Zion, they will love to come together and partake of the spirit present in the  and make it attractive to others. May the Lord bless the Sunday school cause. 

"Our God we Raise to Thee" was sung by the choir and congregation. 

Elder John Henry Smith offered the benediction. 

Amen.

General Superintendent Geo. Q. Cannon. 

From our statistical report it is seen that we number nearly 120,000, in the aggregate, but if we had all the reports in from the various schools there would be upwards of 121,000. The interest in the Sundav schools is growing. Every meeting that we have of this character shows the importance, the growing importance, of this institution among the people, and it is bearing abundant fruit. There are a great many reasons why we should be zealous in this direction. The reports that come to us from the presidents of missions concerning the ignorance of some of our young men who are sent out to help them ought to stir us all up to diligence in imparting a knowledge of our principles to the rising generation. There is a great field, notwithstanding we have labored for so manv vears in this direction, there is a great need that the children, the young people of this community, be instructed thoroughly in the principles of our religion. I feel to congratulate you on your labors, and I can say truly that there is much cause to rejoice in what has been done. The publications of the Sunday School Union are of such a character as to be of great benefit. I wish to call attention, particularly, to the Leaflets. I do not think there has been any publications in our Church that have exceeded in value the Leaflets as they have been issued from time to time by the Union. I think they are invaluable. I would like all the superintendents and teachers to take every pains in their power to have these Leaflets thoroughly studied and mastered by the young people. 

I do not wish to trespass upon your time, as there are many items of business that have to be attended to, but I say as I have said before, God bless you in your labors and give you great success and great joy in continuing your labor in this direction. I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen.

President Joseph F. Smith. 

Possession of Priesthood not confined to a few. 

Although we may enjoy a little a>l\antage over the rest of the congregation, for my part I could stay here a week longer to hear the testimonies of my brethren, and to give to the world an opportunity to see and know that the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not confined to one man, nor to three , nor to fifteen men, but that there are thousands of men in Zion who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, which is after the order of the Son of God, and who possess keys of authority and po-ver to minister for life and salvation amcng the people of the world. I would like to give the world an opportunity to see what we are, to hear what we know, and to understand what our business is and what we intend to do, by the help of the Lord. The choir sang: 

Zion stands with hills surrounded. Benediction by Elder George C. Parkinson, president of Oneida Stake. 

Amen.

President Joseph F. Smith. 

While 1 realize, as you all do doubtless, that it may be wholly unnecessary for me to say what I am going to say, yet I feel prompted to say it, and let it go for what it is worth. I have been delighted with the most excellent discourse that we have listened to; but I desire to say that it is a wonderful revelation to the Latter-day Saints, and especially to those who were familiar with the Prophet Joseph Smith, to learn in these latter days that he was an epileptic! I will simply remark, God be praised, that there are so many still living who knew the Prophet Joseph well, and who are in a position to bear testimony to the truth that no such condition ever existed in the man. He was never troubled with epilepsy. Of course, this may be unnecessary to say,  the magnificent arraignment made by Brother Roberts of this fallacious, foolish, nonsensical theory — this "fried froth" — gotten up by vain philosophers to account for something they would like to destroy from off the face of the earth, but are impotent to do it. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn which begins: 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph M. Tanner. 

Amen.

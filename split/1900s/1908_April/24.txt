Elder Reuben G. Miller. 

(President of Emery Stake). 

I am thankful to be here, and to listen to the testimonies that have been borne. It has done me good, and I trust that all of you who have been in the Tabernacle during this conference, have enjoyed the spirit of it. I think that the key-note has been sounded to this people, and it is that of local option. The time has come when we can put into practice the principles of the Gospel more fully than we have ever done. The Word of Wisdom is one of the most important subjects for this people to observe. For one, I shall advocate that question more strongly in the stake where I reside. At one time I was called upon to report the Emery Stake of Zion, and I spoke of the modern conveniences that were in the stake, not wishing to convey the idea that we had saloons belonging to Latter-day Saints, but that saloons were there. Since that time, several of our people have permitted their names to be stricken from the records of the Church because of engaging in that business. We propose to follow that up, and all who will not live according to the rules of the Church, in this regard, we propose to take their names off of the Church records. Brethren and sisters, I feel encouraged in this work, because I know it is the work of God, and not of man. In and of myself I feel very weak, but I "know that this work is the Lord's, and I am desirous of living up to every principle that the Lord has revealed, doing His will, keeping His commandments, and teaching others to do so. God bless you, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

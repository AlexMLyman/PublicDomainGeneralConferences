Elder Benjamin Goddard. 

We are glad, my brethren and sisters, to meet with you in this capacity. We regret very much that we have not seats for all. It has been suggested that, if the Saints who desire to receive instructions are to be accommodated hereafter, it will be necessary to roof over this entire block. From the increased attendance, it is very evident that "Zion is Growing," and that the cry is going out not only from our children in the Sabbath schools, but from all Israel, "Give us Room that We May Dwell." I pray that the blessings of the Lord may rest upon you, that through your faith and prayers, the brethren who address you may be inspired of Him to give unto you words of wisdom and truthfulness. May God bless you unto that end, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

Sister M. M. Langenbucher. 

My brothers and sisters : One of my greatest privileges is bearing my testimony. I can say that I know the Gospel is true, and I love it. There is nothing in life that has given me so much joy as going on a mission and bearing my testimony unto the people of the world. They ridicule us, but we know it is true, and we do not feel at all hurt for what they say. 

I greatly appreciate the privilege that we have of meeting together in these Conferences. We do not have  privilege out in the world, and we never see so many Saints gathered together as there are here. How happy we all ought to be in coming and receiving words of instruction from those who are placed in authority. If we are humble and prayerful, we can accomplish a great deal of good in this world. 

We are set upon a hill to be a light unto the world, and our actions are watched every day. Out in the mission field, the Elders are watched as they walk the streets, and all their words and actions are closely observed. 

I sincerely trust that the Spirit of our Heavenly Father may abide with us during the rest of our Conference; and that we may enjoy ourselves while receiving instructions that will be for .our eternal benefit. 

I have never had more blessings visited upon me than I did while in the City of Denver, going from house to house and bearing my testimony. 

I pray that the Spirit of God may be with us, that we may be a light to the world, that those who see our good works may glorify our Father which is in heaven. May this be our happy lot, is my prayer in th< name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

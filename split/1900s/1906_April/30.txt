Organ Recitals. 

President Smith requested a vote of the conference on the proposition that free organ recitals be given in this building every Tuesday and Friday, till next conference, explaining that he -wished the vote of the Saints because it required an expenditure of means to heat and light the building - . A vote approving the proposition was 

the result. 

The choir sang the "Hallelujah Chorus," and the benediction was pronounced by President John R. Winder, 

' 95 

after which conference was adjourned for six months. 

The stenographic report of these proceedings was taken by Elders Arthur Winter and P. E. Barker. 

JOHN NICHOLSON, 

Clerk of Conference. 

Amen.

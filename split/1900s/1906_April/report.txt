DAY. 

A banner is unfurled, 
Ye nations now look up, 
It waves to all the world. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(Opening address.) 

Prosperity general among the Saints.— 
Harmony and faithfulness characterize 
the Quorums of Priesthood, and auxil- 
iary organizations. — Duties denned, and 
efficiency to be increased. — Mechanical 
and Agricultural training in Church 
schools.— Striking example of the advan- 
tages of technical education in farming. 
—1905 the "banner year" for tithing con- 
tributions.— Books open for inspection of 
tithepayers.— Object and purpose of the 
Church organization. — Wickedness will 
not be tolerated. 

I feel very grateful for the privilege 
of again meeting with you at one of 
our general conferences, it being the 
seventy-sixth anniversary of the or- 
ganization of the Church, and am 
pleased to see the number in attend- 
ance this morning. I sincerely hope 
that the Spirit of the Lord may dwell 
hi our hearts throughout this con- 
ference, that at the conclusion we may 
feel that our coming together has not 
been in vain, but that much good has 
been accomplished and the require- 
ments of the law of the Church ful- 
filled. We are grateful to the Lord 
for this beautiful morning, and I trust 
that we may be blessed with good 
weather, as well as with a rich out- 
pouring of the Spirit of God, through- 
out the conference. 

It is six months since we last as- 
sembled in general conference, and 
many interesting things have trans- 
pired since then. Prosperity seems

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to have crowned the efforts of the 
Latter-day Saints throughout the land; 
and I do not say this boastingly at 
all, but in the very depths of humility 
and gratitude. I believe that the 
spirit of devotion to the cause of Zion 
has prevailed in the Church during the 
last six months as much as if not more 
than ever before in its history. I be- 
lieve that, speaking in a general way, 
we have been as united as ever before; 
and were it not that some might think 
we were boasting, I would venture to 
say that in my judgment- the Priest- 
hood and the people as a whole have 
never been more united than we are 
today. 

I can assure you, my brethren and 
sisters, that, so far as my knowledge 
extends, the Presidency of the Church 
are united, and the spirit of love and 
confidence possesses our souls. The 
Lord has blessed us abundantly with 
health and with a reasonable outpour- 
ing of His Spirit. We have endeavored 
to meet the obligations that have de- 
volved upon us, to the best of our abil- 
ity and to the utmost of the strength 
and wisdom the Lord has given us. 
"We have not shrunk from any duty. 
We have sought to meet every re- 
quirement made of us as best we could, 
and we have reasonable assurance that 
so far the Lord has been pleased 
with our efforts and has accepted our 
labors. We desire to continue in the 
labor required at our hands, so long 
as the Lord shall desire it; and I be- 
lieve my counselors feel just as I 
do when I say that whenever the 
Father is satisfied with our services, 
we shall bow humbly and gratefully 
to His will. 

With reference to the brethren of 
the Twelve, with whom we meet from 
week to week, and often from day 
to day, in council, I have to say that 
those of them who have been with 
us are united together and in full har- 
mony with us. I believe that the 
brethren of the Twelve who have been 
at their posts, performing their duty, 
stand solid for the advancement of the 
kingdom of God, and are united in 
their views and labors for the up- 



building of Zion. There are circum- 
stances connected with these matters 
which are not altogether pleasant, and 
which are fraught, in some respects, 
with very serious consequences. But 
I have no hesitancy in recommending 
to you, brethren of the Priesthood and 
members of the Church, those mem- 
bers of the Council of the Apostles who 
have kept within the spirit of their 
calling, who have sought to magnify 
the same, and who have been instant 
in season and out of season in the per- 
formance of the duties that have de- 
volved upon them. They are worthy 
of the confidence of the Latter-day 
Saints, are valiant in their testimony 
for the truth, are earnest and vigilant 
in their watchcare over the interests 
of Zion submitted to them, and have 
labored diligently in the mission field, 
at home and abroad, as much as op- 
portunity has afforded. 

With reference to the brethren of 
the Presiding Council of Seventy, I 
desire to express my commendation 
of them. They have always been on 
hand, ready to respond to every call 
made upon them, so far as their health 
and other important duties would 
permit. It is understood generally 
that Brother B. H. Roberts, one of the 
presidents, is engaged on the History 
of the Church, and is connected in this 
labor with the Historian's office. A 
large proportion of his time is required 
in this duty. Nevertheless he has re- 
sponded to the calls that have been 
made upon him, dropping his work and 
going out to visit the conferences when- 
ever required. The same may be said 
with reference to the other members of 
the Council. Brother George Reynolds 
another member, is a man much en- 
cumbered with duties in connection 
with the missionary work, the calling 
of Elders for missions, the keeping of 
their records, and also! the labor of the 
Sunday school, and other matters as- 
sociated with the President's office. He 
is a man who; labors from morning till 
night, early and late, and is most faith- 
ful and diligent in the performance of 
his duty. Moreover, he is most cap- 
able, being blessed of the Lord abund-

antly in the calling to which he is as- 
signed. I mention these two brethren 
for the reason that they are occupied 
in clerical work to a great extent, and 
are therefore not at liberty so much 
as the others to visit the conferences 
and labor in the ministry. 

I am sorry to say that all the Pre- 
siding Bishopric of the Church are not 
in the enjoyment of perfect health, but 
they are united, diligent and faithful 
in the discharge of their duties, and 
their integrity is unquestioned. With 
the assistance they have in their office, 
which is most capable and efficient, 
the duties and responsibilities of their 
office are well and faithfully perform- 
ed. I regret to say that Bishop Bur- 
ton's health is very poor at present, but 
I understand he is improving, and I 
trust he will soon be himself again. 

I would like to say a few words in re- 
gard to the various quorums of the 
Priesthood in the Church — the High 
Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and 
the lesser Priesthood. The aim of those 
in charge of these quorums has been 
to awaken within the hearts of those 
who compose them a livelier interest 
in their work; and I believe it may be 
said in all candor and consistency that 
there never has been a time when the 
various quorums of the Priesthood were 
more interested in their work, more 
alive to their duties, looking more di- 
rectly to their legitimate calling, and 
paying more attention to the respon- 
sibilities that devolve upon them, than 
they are today. The Presidents of the 
Stakes are taking up the work of the 
quorums, especially of the lesser 
Priesthood, and they are endeavoring 
to arouse the members of the Priesthood 
to a realization of the great responsi- 
bilities that devolve upon them by rea- 
son of the Priesthood they hold and 
their connection with the quorums 
thereof. We expect to see the day, if 
we live long enough (and if some of us 
do not live long enough to see it, there 
are others who will), when every coun- 
cil of the Priesthood in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will 
understand its duty, will assume its 
•own responsibility, will magnify its 



calling, and fill its place in the Church, 
to the uttermost, according to the in- 
telligence and ability possessed by it. 
When that day shall come, there will 
not be so much necessity for work that 
is now being done by the auxiliary 
organizations, because it will be done 
by the regular quorums of the Priest- 
hood. The Lord designed and compre- 
hended it from the beginning, and He 
has „ made provision in the Church 
whereby every need may be met and 
satisfied through the regular organiza- 
tions of the Priesthood. It has truly 
been said that the Church is perfectly 
organized. The only trouble is that 
these organizations are not fully alive 
to the obligations that rest upon them. 
When they become thoroughly awaken- 
ed to the requirements made of them, 
they will fulfill their duties more faith- 
fully, and the work of the Lord will be 
all the stronger and more powerful and 
influential in the world. 

A word or two in relation to the Re- 
lief society. This is an organization 
that was established by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. It is, therefore, the old- 
est auxiliary organization of the Church 
and it is of the first importance. It has 
not only to deal with the necessities 
of the poor, the sick and the needy, 
but a part of its duty — and the larger 
part, too — is to look after the spiritual 
welfare and salvation of the mothers 
and daughters of Zion; to see that 
none is neglected, but that all are 
guarded against misfortune, calamity, 
the powers of darkness, and the evils 
that threaten them in the world. It is 
the dutv of the Relief Societies to look 
after the spiritual welfare of them- 
selves and of all the female memoers 
of the Church. It is their duty to col- 
lect means from those who have in 
abundance, and distribute it wisely 
unto those in need. It is a part of 
their duty to see that there are those 
capable of being nurses as well as 
teachers and exemplars in Zion, and 
that they have an opportunity to be- 
come thoroughly prepared for this 
great labor and responsibility. I have 
heard of a disposition on the part of 
some of our sisters to become a law

unto themselves in relation to these 
things. I would like to say that it is 
expected of the Relief Society, espec- 
ially the general authorities of that 
great organization, that they will have 
a watchcare over all the organizations 
among the women of Zion. They stand 
at the head of all such; they ought to 
stand at the head, and they should 
magnify their calling, and see to it 
that error is not permitted to creep in, 
that cabals are not formed, that secret 
combinations may not get a foothold, 
to mislead the sisters. They should 
see to it that the other organizations 
of women in the Church correspond 
and are in harmony with their organ- 
ization. Why should this be? In order 
that the women of Zion may be united, 
that their interests may be in common, 
and not conflicting or segregated, and 
that the purpose of this organization 
may be realized and the organization 
itself be effective for good in every 
part of the Church throughout the 
world, wherever the Gospel is preached. 
We realize that it is impossible for 
men or women possessing physical 
weaknesses on account of age or in- 
firmities, to meet every requirement; 
but we expect that every man and 
woman entrusted with responsibility 
in the Church will do their duty to the 
utmost of their ability. That we look 
for; that we pray for; for that we la- 
bor to the best of the ability and 
strength we possess. 

When I arose this morning I did not 
design to occupy much time, but I 
would like to say something in rela- 
tion to other organizations; and if 
I do not touch upon all of them, no 
one need feel slighted, for I feel that 
the eyes of the Lord and of His ser- 
vants are over all these organizations. 
We are cognizant of their existence; 
we know somewhat of their labors and 
of the responsibilities that rest upon 
them; we are not blind to their efforts, 
nor to the good thev are accomplish- 
ing. I want to say a few words con- 
cerning our Sunday school organiza- 
tion. I do not think any one will claim 
that at any previous time in the 
Church the Sunday school organization 



was any more perfect or efficient than 
it is today. Do you think so. Brother 
Reynolds? (addressing him). [Broth- 
er Reynolds: "No, sir; I do not."] I 
believe that those who are connected 
with this work and familiar with what 
is beine: accomplished by it will be 
unanimous in the claim I make that 
never before, since the Sunday schools 
were organized in the days of our early 
settlement here, has this organization 
been so perfect and efficient as it is to- 
day. The brethren of the Sunday 
School Union Board meet every week, 
and they are interested in their work, 
Some of the members live at a dis- 
tance and cannot attend, but most of 
those who are within reach attend 
their council meetings every week, 
where matters connected with the 
Sunday schools are thoroughly con- 
sidered and weighed, and conclusions 
are reached, after much careful delib- 
eration and thought, in relation to the 
work that is sought to be accomplished 
in the Sunday schools. I feel thankful 
to my Father in heaven that we have 
so many efficient, capable workers in 
our Sunday schools, who are diligent 
in the performance of their duty, who 
wield such a wholesome influence over 
the minds of the pupils, and whose ex- 
amples are such as to make 
them worthy of all commendation. I 
desire to commend to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the 
laborers in the Sunday schools, and I 
trust that the parents will sustain them 
in their callings, strengthen their 
hands, by encouraging their children 
to attend the schools on the Sabbath 
day and to show deference and respect 
for their teachers. 

Our Young Men's Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations are in as good care 
and keeping as could be expected. This 
is an organization which only continues 
a portion of the year. During the busy 
season, when young men are required 
on the farms, these associations sus- 
pend for a time; but the work is car- 
ried on all through the winter season, 
from October to April, when the youth 
of Zion are able to attend to their du- 
ties in these organizations. I desire to 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

say that our best missionaries are 
called from these Mutual Improvement 
Associations. The young men that make 
the most efficient missionaries are those 
who have been faithful in these organi- 
zations. It is true we have missionary 
classes in our Church schools, where 
the young- men who have not paid much 
attention to religious matters and are 
not well read in the scriptures, may gc 
for a short season and receive instruc- 
tion. But this work is only temporary 
compared with the work of the Mutual 
Improvement Association. It is alto- 
gether too brief, and those who attend 
t;;ese classes are generally pushed for 
time, in a hurry to get home and go 
to work again, and can scarcely stay 
long enough to finish the course. There- 
fore, I repeat that our best and most 
effective workers in the mission field 
are those that have given most atten- 
tion to the Mutual Improvement work 
at home. So that it is doing good. 

Ihe Young Ladies' Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations are also prosperous 
and doing a glorious work. Yet for 
buth of these organizations the field is 
broad, and the laborers are indeed few. 
But they are doing the best they can 
under the circumstances, I believe, and 
I have only words of commendation 
for them. 

Our Primary Associations are also ef^. 
fkient and doing much good among the 
little children, and I commend their la- 
bor and organization, and exhort them 
to diligence in the performance of their 
duty and economy in the use of the 
means that comes into their hands, as 
I do the Relief Society. I say to all 
these organizations that it is expected 
of them that in all their dealings they 
will operate on business principles, 
strictly upon honor, so that it may 
never be necessary to cover a single 
track they make, but that every step 
they take may be above board and open 
to the scrutiny of all who may be in- 
terested. It is expected that they will 
make reports from time to time, as re- 
quired, both of their financial and their 
ecclesiastical work. 

We have a number of Church schools 



established in Zion. I have not taken 
the pains to post myself as to the ex- 
act number, but I believe there art 
about 17. The Brigham Young Uni- 
versity in Provo, the Latter-day Saints' 
University in this city, and the Brig- 
ham Young College in Logan, are in- 
stitutions of which the whole Church 
has reason to be proud. The Trustee- 
in-Trust, by and with th<» advice of the 
First Presidency and the Council of 
Apostles, has given as liberally as pos- 
sible, consistent with other obligation^, 
for the maintenance of our Church 
schools. We have sought to encourage 
in our Church schools the establish- 
ment of .departments of mechanic arts 
ani 1 . manual training; and. so far as 
I know, everything possible is being 
done, at least in the principal schools, 
for the training of our youth, not only 
in the regular mechanic arts, but also 
in the art of agriculture. An agricul- 
tural course has recently been started 
in the Brigham Young University, and 
one of our most proficient scientists has 
teen called to take charge of the class. 
I am happy to say that some of our old- 
est farmers are delighted with the 
information they have obtained by at- 
tending this class. I heard a brother 
who had been farming for many years, 
say that he had always been under the 
impression that when a man could not 
do anything else, all he had to do was 
to turn his attention to the plow and 
cultivate the soil, for anybody could 
make a farmer, but he had found out 
since attending his class that it re- 
quired intelligence and intelligent ap- 
plication to be a good farmer, as well 
as to be a good artisan. In connec- 
tion with this I may state a circum- 
stance that came under my own ob- 
servation years ago. A certain brother 
had lived upon his farm for some four- 
teen or fifteen years. He had culti- 
vated it every year the best he could, 
but it had become so impoverished that 
he could not make a living off it any 
longer, and he became so disgusted 
wi,th the country, especially with his 
farm, that he concluded, if he could 
only trade the farm off for a team and 



6

wagon that would take him out of the 
country, he would be glad to go. By 
and by his man came along, and he 
sold his farm for a team and wagon, 
in which he put his wife and children 
and moved to some other country. The 
purchaser took possession of this worn- 
out farm, and within three years, by 
intelligent operation, he was able to 
gather from that farm forty bushels 
of wheat to the acre, and other pro- 
ducts in proportion. The nutriment 
of the soil had been exhausted, and it 
needed resuscitation; so he went to 
work, gave it the nourishment it re- 
quired, and reaped a bountiful harvest 
as a result of his wisdom. There are 
too many of our farmers who think it 
does not need any skill to be a farmer; 
but this good brother in Provo to whom 
I alluded found it did. So we are 
teaching agriculture in our schools, as 
well as the mechanic arts. The Brig- 
ham Young College is putting up a 
building now wherein are to be taught 
all sorts of industries; where our youth 
will be able to learn carpentry, black- 
smithing, domestic arts, and other 
things that will be useful to them. Yet 
we find it a drag to induce anybody 
that is possessed of means to contribute 
very largely to it. Some of our 
wealthiest men felt the^- were doing 
their utmost when they donated per- 
haps a hundred dollars towards a 
building that will cost eight or ten 
thousand dollars, if not more. I men- 
tion this for the reason that in my 
opinion the Church schools are laying 
the foundation for great usefulness 
among the people of God, and they 
should be sustained by the people and 
by the Church. The Church is sus- 
taining them, and as we acquire more 
means and become more free from ob- 
ligations which have been resting upon 
the Church for years, we will be more 
freehanded to administer to the needs 
of our Church schools, as well as other 
requirements of that nature. 

The Religion Class work is an ad- 
junct to the Church schools. It is 
under the direction of President An- 
thon H. Lund and his associates, and it 



is a necessary and most interesting ad- 
junct to our auxiliai^ organizations. 
It was established to assist in the pro- 
per training and education of our chil- 
dren, and I commend it to the presid- 
ing authorities throughout the Church, 
and bespeak for it their kind attention, 
encouragement and assistance, so far 
as it lies in their power. Let us take 
care of these things, for they nurture 
and strengthen our children in the right 
direction, and there is nothing more im- 
portant. If is extreme folly for any 
people to send thousands of mission- 
aries out into the world to preach the 
Gospel to the nations, and neglect their 
own children at home. I think our 
very first interest should be to look 
after our children, and see that they 
have every advantage necessary to 
bring them up in the way they should 
go, that when they get old they may 
not depart from it. 

I want to say to the Latter-day 
Saints that the year 1905 has been the 
banner year for the tithings of the peo- 
ple. You can put that down in your 
memorandum books, and remember it. 
Never in the history of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have 
the people contributed as much tithing 
as they did in 1905. And yet they have 
not done anything more than their 
duty; in fact, there are a great many 
Latter-day Saints that have not done 
their duty, as the books will show. 

In this connection I may say that 
a most thorough and searching audita- 
tion of the books of the Trustee-in- 
Trust, the books of the Presiding 
Bishopric, and the books of the Deseret 
News Company, has been made by the 
auditors that were appointed and sus- 
tained at our last conference. Before 
the conclusion of this conference we 
will read you their report, and I be- 
lieve you will be perfectly satisfied 
with it. The man that complains about 
not knowing what is done with the 
tithing, in ninety-nine cases out of a 
hundred is the man who has no credit 
on the books of the Church for pay- 
ing tithing. We do not care to 
exhibit the books of the Church to 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

such carpers and to that class of peo- 
ple. But there is not a tithepayer 
in the Church that cannot go to the 
Presiding Bishop's Office, or to the of- 
fice of the Trustee-in-Trust, if he de- 
sires, and find his account, and see to 
it that every dollar he has given to 
the Lord for tithing is credited to him. 
Then, if he wants to be more search- 
ing as a tithepayer and find out what 
is done with the tithing, we will set be- 
fore him the whole thing, and if he has 
any good counsel to give us we will 
take it from him. But we will not — 
because we do not have to, and it is not 
the business of the world to require it- 
open our books to the world, unless we 
wish to. We are not ashamed of them. 
We are not afraid for them to be in- 
spected. They are honest and straight; 
and there is not a man in the world 
that will look at them, but will say so, 
if he is honest himself. 

I do not know but I have trespassed 
upon your time, but there are other 
things that pass through my mind. We 
are contributing means for the pur- 
chase and maintenance of mission 
houses in the world; and today we 
have more headquarters belonging to 
the Church in Great Britain, in Scan- 
dinavia, in the United States and in 
the islands of the sea, where our Elders 
may rendezvous and find a resting place 
in time of sickness or distress, and 
where they may meet for counsel, than 
evier bjefore. When I say that I do 
,not boast at all; I simply give it to 
you for information and as a statement 
of fact. 

So we may say that notwithstanding 
the opposition, the bitterness, the hat- 
red, the falsehoods, the slanders and 
the misrepresentations with which the 
public press has been filled for year3 
concerning the Latter-day Saints and 
the authorities of the Church, there 
never was a time when the Church 
prospered more than it is doing today; 
and I do not know but we ought to be 
thankful that the Lord lets our enemies 
expose themselves as they do. 

The Lord bless you. I see before me- 
the leaders of the Church, the presiding 



spirits, in the capacity of Presidents of 
Stakes, Counselors to Presidents of 
Stakes, High Councilors, Bishops and 
their counselors, and those who are en- 
gaged in our educational institutions 
and in other responsible positions in 
the Church. I honor you all. I love 
you for your integrity to the cause of 
Zion. It is the kingdom of God or 
nothing, so far as I am concerned. I 
cut no figure personally in this work, 
and I am nothing except in the humble 
effort to do my duty as the Lord gives 
me the ability to do it. But it is the 
kingdom of God. What I mean by the 
kingdom of God is the organization of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, of which Jesus Christ is 
the king and the head; not as an or- 
ganization in any wise menacing or 
jeopardizing the liberties or rights of 
the people throughout the world, but 
an organization calculated to lift up 
and ameliorate the condition of man- 
kind; to make bad men good, if it js 
possible for them to repent of their 
sins, and to make good men better. That 
is the object and purpose of the Church, 
that is what it is accomplishing in the 
world. And it is very strict in regard 
to these matters. Drunkards, whore- 
mongers, liars, thieves, those that be- 
tray the confidence of their fellowmen, 
those who are unworthy of credence, 
unworthy of love and confidence — all 
such, when their character becomes 
known, are disfellowshiped from the 
Church, and are not permitted to have 
a standing in it, if we know it. It is 
true that there are none of us but have 
our imperfections and shortcomings. 
Perfection dwells not with mortal man. 
We all have our weaknesses. But when 
a man abandons the truth, virtue, his 
love for the Gospel and .for the people of 
God, and becomes an open, avowed en- 
emy, it becomes the duty of the Church, 
and the Church would be recreant to 
its duty if it did not sever him from 
communion, cut him off, and let him 
go where he pleases. We would do 
wrong if we hung on to and tried to 
nurture such evil creatures in our 
midst, no matter what the relationship

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



may be that exists between us and 
them. Therefore, I say again, the 
Church of Jesus Christ stands for vir- 
tue, honor, truth, purity of life, and 
good will to all mankind. It stands for 
God the Eternal Father, and for Jesus 
Christ, whom the Father sent into the 
world, and whom to know is life eter- 
nal. This is what the Church stands 
for, and it cannot tolerate abomina- 
tion crime and wickedness on the part 
of those who may claim to have some 
connection with it. We must sever our- 
selves from them, and let them go. Not 
that we want to hurt them. "We dc 
not want to hurt anybody. "We never 
have, and we do not intend to, hurt 
anybody. But »we do not intend to be 
hurt by those who are seeking our de- 
struction, if we can help it. It is our 
right to protect ourselves. 

Now, God bless you. May peace abide 
in your souls, and the love of truth 
abound in you. May virtue garnish 
all your ways. May you live uprightly 
and honestly before the Lord, keep the 
faith, and be valiant in the testimony 
of Jesus Christ; for he that is valiant 
will receive his reward. God bless you. 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Let 
the mountains shout for joy." 



UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES. 

President Smith explained that ac- 
cording to the deed of the Brigham 
Young University, the trustees of that 
institution shall be presented every 
three years to be sustained at the gen- 
eral conference. He therefore pre- 
sented the following names for the 
vote of the Saints: 

Joseph F. Smith, David John, Wilson 
H. Dusenberry, Susa Y. Gates, Reed 
Smoot, John Henry Smith, Lafayette 
Holbrook, Stephen L. Chipman, Jesse 
Knight, Oscar B. Young, Jonathan S. 
Page, Jr., Richard W. Young. The 
vote was unanimous. 



PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Testimony concerning the truth of Presi- 
dent Smith's statements. — Gratifying in- 
crease of interest in Temple work.— The 
Lord will bless the faithful. 

I feel very thankful this morning to 
■have the privilege of meeting once 
more with you in general conference. I 
have listened with much pleasure to 
the statements made by our President 
in relation to the condition of the 
Church of Jesu 3 Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I have no doubt that you also 
have listened with the same degree of 
interest. I rejoice exceedingly that 1 
can bear testimony to the truth of 
what he has said, in all particulars. 
I am very thankful that the Lord has 
been so kind and generous to me as to 
extend my years until the present time, 
and I pray and hope that the remaindei 
of my days may be spent in assisting to 
build up His Church upon the earth. 

I remember that in the last sermon 
preached by the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
he laid particular stress upon the duties 
and obligations of the Latter-day Saints 
in relation to the redemption of their 
dead. I rejoice to know that the dispo- 
sition and feeling of the Latter-da> 
Saints in this direction is improving, 
and that the number attending to this 
w ork in the temples is increasing al! 
tne time. A little item that has ap- 
peared in the statistics we have re- 
ceived is of much interest to me, name- 
ly, that during the past year there has 
been a very decided increase in the 
number of marriages in the temples. 
We are much gratified to know that our 
ycung people are looking towards the 
temples of God as the proper places for 
the performance of the marriage cere- 
mony. We hope they will continue to 
do so, and that there will be a still 
greater increase in thi s direction dur- 
ing the present year. I look upon the 
payment of tithing, ahd the desire of 
the people to perform temple ordinances 
and work for the redemption of their 
dead, as good indications of the faith- 
ful condition of the Saints. 

I am thankful, my brothers and sis- 
ters, for this opportunity to bear tes- 
timony to what has been said. I do

not feel to occupy your time, but I de- 
sire to express my thanks and gratitude 
to God for every blessing He has be- 
stowed upon His people. I am satisfied 
that if we continue to prosecute our la- 
bor? as faithfully as we have done in 
the past the Lord will continue to bless 
us, and will multiply us upon the earth. 
May God bless you, my brethren ana 
sisters. Many of you have traveled 
long distances to come up here to spend 
a short time in conference. May you be 
abundantly repaid for all that you have 
done in this direction. 

God bless you, and all pertaining un- 
to you, and may your substance, and 
everything that is needful for your 
■welfare, be multiplied and increased, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Ainen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

The ethics of "Mormonism".— Pursuit of 
worldly affairs quenches love of Gospel. 
—Essentiality of religious, intellectual, 
and manual education.— Advantages of 
Church school instruction.— Gratifying 
progress of the Church at home and 
abroad. 

When President Smith in his clos- 
ing remarks told us what the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
stands for, I thought of these words, 
given in an early revelation: 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, 
temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, dili- 
gence, ask, and ye shall receive; knock 
and it shall be opened unto you." 

This passage contains the ethics of 
Mormonism, and is what the Church 
stands for. I believe that we, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, are remembering these 
virtues, and that faith is increasing in 
our midst. It would be well for us 
all to examine ourselves and see if 
our faith is increasing, or if we are 
getting indifferent and our faith de- 
creasing. We should do this thorough- 
ly; let our criticism of self be severe 
so that we may see ourselves in the 
true light. Many who received the 
Gospel abroad, in thinking over the 
Past, are led to say: "How sweet was 
the word of God as it came to us 



through the servants of the Lord." 
Eut since coming here they have be- 
come so absorbed in business and 
worldly pursuits that they seem to 
have forgotten the object of their 
gathering with the Saints. To such 
I will say, Stop, and try to regain that 
first love of the Gospel which, even 
now, gives you so much pleasure in re- 
calling. A friend, whom I remember 
from my childhood, said a short time 
ago: "You may not think that I am 
very staunch in the faith when you 
see how little I do in a Church way, 
but I wish to say that, when I think 
of those early days, when I joined the 
Church, it warms my heart, and I feel 
thankful that I have a knowledge of 
the truth." Here is one who has let 
the present absorb all his energies, and 
he has become seemingly indifferent 
to the requirments of the Gospel. This 
should not be the case with any of us. 
We should remember and do the duties 
required of us as Saints. 

We should remember our fellowmen, 
and that we owe the duty of making 
them acquainted with the faith God 
has given us. There are many living 
right in our midst who do not know 
what we believe. Many of us are will- 
ing to go to the ends of the earth to 
proclaim the glad tidings of a restor- 
ed Gospel, but do not think of our 
neighbors who live in the same street 
with us, and who know nothing about 
our religion except that which they 
read in newspapers inimical to us. We 
should be ready to bear our testimony 
to them, and above all let our good 
works so shine that they may know we 
are endeavoring to be the children of 
God. 

We should cultivate the virtues 
mentioned in the passage I have read. 
We are there encouraged to seek 
knowledge. The President has given 
us a statement of the different or- 
ganizations in the Churteh, and has 
told us their aim and purpose. The 
object of the quorums of the Priest- 
hood, and the auxiliary organizations, 
is that their members n*ay acquire 
knowledge, and self improvement. If 
we are called an ignorant people, we

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



want to make it manifest to the world 
that the charge is not true, but that 
we are obeying the commands of the 
Lord, seeking knowledge ourselves and 
are imparting this also to our chil- 
dren. I feel proud of what the Latter- 
day Saints are doing for their children 
in regard to education; they are alive 
to the necessity of having them tho- 
roughly instructed. We do not want 
the mind trained alone, but also the 
hands. We desire that the education 
we give our children shall be most 
useful to them. The object of giv- 
ing them a good education should not 
be alone for the purpose that they may 
be able to gain a living without man- 
ual labor. It is true that we need 
many teachers; we need many men 
and women in other professions also, 
and they must devote their time to fit 
and prepare therrfselves for such 
positions; but all our children 
cannot expect to enter the pro- 
fessions. There are, however, 
many vocations open to all, and a 
skilled hand will always find work. 
Presidents Smith and Winder are 
much in favor of giving our children 
thorough manual training. We should 
teach them to regard labor as en- 
nobling, and not to look down upon the 
farmer or the tradesman as engaged in 
occupations beneath the professional 
man, for the one is as noble as the 
other. The professions may require 
more study, but those having attain- 
ments in these directions should not 
look down upon those who are skilled 
in the trades. Professions and handi- 
crafts, should go hand in hand. 

We desire our children to get a good, 
solid education, both secular and spir- 
itual. We would like our people to 
sustain the Church schools and let 
their children spend some time in them 
— a year, two years, four years if they 
can afford it — so that they may have 
opportunity to study theology. We 
have excellent school all over the state, 
and the people should make the best 
use of them; and when the children get 
through the grades let them attend our 
Church schools. The Church has ad- 
vanced a great deal of money to sus- 



tain these institutions, >n order ihat 
our boys and girls may attend them 
and become grounded in the faith. 
Our faith is valued 6>0 highly by us 
that we want them to appreciate it 
also, and it is gratifying to see that 
when they receive religious; instruc- 
tions in these schools they love it. To- 
some it may be irksome, but there are 
few who complain of theological studv 
in the school. It is for religious train- 
ing especially that Church schools, 
have been established. If a student 
wants to take only the secular branch- 
es of education, with theology elim- 
inated, he can get all he wants at the 
state institutions; but he must attend 
the Church schools if he wishes re- 
ligious instruction. We would en- 
courage our people to give this due 
thought. We cannot overestimate the 
value of giving our children an op- 
portunity to study under teachers who- 
will teach them the way of life and 
salvation. Of course, a great many 
cannot attend the Church schools. We 
would like such to have a chance to 
obtain religious instruction, and for 
this purpose religion classes have been 
established. I was thankful that the 
President brought them to our notice. 
I hope that all of us will try to make 
these religion classes do as much good 
as possible to our children. 

I rejoice, brethren and sisters, in see- 
ing the progress that the work of the 
Lord is making, both at home and 
abroad. At home I see that the quor- 
ums of the Priesthood are awakening 
to their duties, and that in many of 
the Stakes the Presidents and their 
counselors, the Bishops and their 
counselors, are taking an active part 
in making the quorum meetings inter- 
esting unto the members. The quor- 
ums are indeed like schools, in them 
the duties of the Priesthood can and 
should be taught, so that every one, 
from the Deacon to the High Priest, 
may learn his duty, and not be ignor- 
ant of what pertains to the office as- 
signed him. Abroad the work is pro- 
gressing. Among the Greeks the Gos- 
pel has been sounded, pamphlets have 
been printed, and a few people haver 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



11 



been baptized. In all the countries of 
Europe there are Latter-day Saints, 
excepting Spain and Portugal, though 
there are not many in Southern Eu- 
rope. I hope that the time may- soon 
come when the Gospel door- shall be 
opened in these nations, and that the 
light may shine upon those who still 
sit in darkness. Our missions in the 
United States are prospering. The 
Southern States mission is reaching 
out even to the islands in the ocean, 
and I hope they will succeed in plant- 
ing the Gospel there. From everywhere 
we receive good reports concerning the 
Saints, and the missionaries feel en- 
couraged, though baptisms are not as 
numerous as they would like. Never- 
theless, when the time comes and the 
Lord shall work uoon the hearts of the 
people, we may see manv Pentecosts 
in different lands. In regard to the 
printed word, I may say that the Book 
of Mormon is being printed in the 
Turkish language; and Brother Aima 
0. Taylor, in Japan, is nearing the 
completion of the translation of the 
Book of Mormon in that difficult lan- 
guage. We are trying to do what we 
can to bear the responsibility that 
rests upon us, namely that the Gos- 
pel be preached unto all nations. God 
bless you all. Amen. 

The choir and congregation united 
in singing the hymn. 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call; 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder David H. Cannon, and confer- 
ence was adjourned till 2 p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference convened at 2 p. m. 

The ohoir and congregation sang 
the hymn beginning, 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam; 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 



And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Wil- 
liam McLachlan. 

The choir and congregation sang, 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah! 

Jesus anointed that Prophet and 

, Seer; 

Blessed to open the last dispensation, 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
can hardly express to you the gratitude 
I feel for the privilege of attending this- 
great conference, looking over this 
large congregation of Latter-day 
Saints, and witnessing the feeling of 
unity of purpose that has brought you 
together. The Latter-day Saints are 
increasing. The work of the Lord is 
spreading abroad, and we are witnesses 
that there is remarkable evidence of 
this fact today. I rejoice when I hear 
such a report as we listened to this 
morning from the President of the- 
Church, concerning the union of the- 
Saints and their endeavors to do the 
will of the Father and keep His com- 
mandments. 

Seventy-six years ago today the- 
Church was organized, and beside the 
six persons who were the charter mem- 
bers of the organization, there were 
very few who belonged to the Church 
at that time, hence we conclude that 
the work has greatly increased, andi 
the truth continues to spread abroad 
over many lands and among many peo- 
ple. The Lord is fulfilling His pre- 
diction to the Prophet Joseph, that He 
would bring to pass "a marvelous work 
and a wonder." I have a perfect knowl- 
edge of the fact that the Church has 
disseminated among the children of 
men principles of truth, righteousness- 
and love, and not principles of hate. It 
is love of the Gospel that has prompt- 
ed so many people to receive the mes- 
sage which was brought unto them by 
the followers of the Prophet, who was- 
the means, under our Savior, of intro—

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ducing this great work in the earth. 
Soon after the return of Zion's Camp 
in the fall of 1834 (in the spring of 1835), 
the first Twelve Apostles in this dis- 
pensation were chosen and ordained. 
Two full quorums of Seventy were also 
organized, and from those two quor- 
ums the number has increased until 
now we have in the Church upwards of 
9,000 Seventies, and 148 quorums or- 
ganized, with still others in prospect. 
We have very great occasion to rejoice., 
my brethren and sisters, because of 
the prosperity of the Saints in every 
part of the land, and the prosperity of 
our missions in the different nations o f 
the earth. We have at this time nearly 
2,000 Elders in the field proclaiming the 
Gospel, devoting their best energies to 
spreading the truth, offering their time 
and means, and the best talents they 
possess, even risking their lives if nec- 
essary to fulfill the missions assigned 
them. 

After the martyrdom of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the presidency of the 
Church devolved upon the quorum of 
the Apostles, and President Brigham 
Young stood at their head as captain 
and file leader, to carry out the plans 
that had been designated by the Proph- 
et Joseph. There were many hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, present at the meet- 
ing held in the grove near the Temple 
a t Nauvoo, in August, 1844, when Pres- 
ident Young was recognized by mirac- 
ulous manifestation as the leader of the 
Church, and they have testified it was 
evident that the mantle of Joseph the 
Prophet fell upon him. I was looking 
over the record a few days ago, and 
tried to ascertain how many of that 
number are still living who can bear 
►witness to that remarkable event. I 
had a letter recently from Brothers 
Horace and John R. Murdoch of Bea- 
ver, who testify that they were eye- 
witnesses to the wonderful transforma- 
tion and power manifested through 
President Brigham Young on that oc- 
casion. Of the many hundreds who wit- 
nessed that event you can almost count 
upon your 10 fingers the number that 
are still living. 

When we came to this Rocky Moun- 
tain region it was practically an un- 



known land. It was designated on the 
maps of our country as the Great 
American Desert, and this valley was 
almost the central portion of it; a 
country where no white man lived, and 
which even Indians shunned. But the 
Lord's blessing rested upon this land 
and upon the people. Brigham Young, 
at a very early date in the settlement 
of the country, began to devise means 
to improve the conditions of the people 
in every way possible, to increase their 
chances of living and prospering in 
this desert region. The Lord abund- 
antly blessed the labors of the people, 
and from that little hand-full in the 
desert, communities have grown and 
spread throughout all this region of the 
Rocky Mountains. This fulfills a pre- 
diction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
made in 1842, when he prophesied that 
the Saints would continue to be driven 
and persecuted, and that they would fi- 
nally leave their homes and journey to 
the west; many would lay down their 
lives by the wayside, and some would 
lose faith, but many of the Saints 
would arrive in the Rocky Mountains 
and there become a great and mighty 
people. We are witnesses today of + he 
literal fulfillment of this prophecy. 

In the beginning of our history here, 
President Brigham Young established 
manufactories of clothing, of leather, 
of boots and shoes and other articles. 
Home industry was a frequent theme 
of his counsel and admonition to the 
Saints in the hope that they might 
adopt it, and thereby become an inde- 
pendent people. A woolen factory 
was established in Boxelder county, one 
in Weber county, two in Salt Lake 
county, one in Washington county, near 
St. George, and finally a larger one in 
Provo. All of these institutions were, 
within my memory, prosperous and ad- 
vancing in usefulness, and making 
wealth by reason of the patronage 
given to them by the Latter-day Saints. 
But by degrees we have displayed less 
loyalty to these institutions, and the 
industries have decreased, until the 
last of these beneficial institutions has 
become a thing of the past. I refer 
to the closing down of the factory at 
Provo, through lack of patronage. I

speak of this, my brethren and sisters, 
in order to refer your minds to past 
history, and to call your attention to 
the fact that had these instituions bean 
supported in the spirit in which they 
were established under the direction of 
President Young, they would have been 
sources of wealth and of help to us 
today and great benefit to all the peo- 
ple in this region. Z. C. M. I. also is an' 
institution that was established undar 
President Young's counsel and manage- 
ment, and it has gone forward to a 
wonderful degree of prosperity, be- 
cause it has had the loyal support of 
the people, and I trust it will continue 
to have it. ^ 

We are certainly blessed of the Lord 
today; we have been blessed every day 
and every hour since we obeyed the 
Gospel, and entered into covenant with 
Him, provided we have kept that cove- 
nant. When I look over the statistical 
reports of our missionaries laboring in 
every land of the globe where they have 
been sent I rejoice exceedingly. The 
missions already established are grow- 
ing in importance, the Seventies and 
the Elders are going out and unstint- 
edly giving the best powers of their 
manhood to develop this cause, to pro-> 
claim the truth, and to scatter the seedn 
of the Gospel for the redemption of the 
human family far and wide in the na- 
tions of the earth. 

I testify to you today that Jesus is 
the Christ, and that Joseph Smith was 
His Prophet, and will ever be the Pres- 
ident and leader of this dispensation. 
I testify that our President today, and 
those who are associated with him are 
the men our Father has chosen to lead 
us and to guide the destinies of Israel 
at the present time, to push forward 
the work 'with strong hands and mighty 
power. That the blessing of the Lord 
and the Spirit of His presence may rest 
upon this conference throughout, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

Among the things important for the 
Saints of God to understand, among 
the things important for the world 
to understand respecting the Lat- 



ter-day Saints, is the relation- 
ship that we sustain to the religious 
world; and I do not know that there 
is anything to which I could devote the 
few minutes at my disposal to better 
advantage than pointing out that rela- 
tionship, if I can obtain, through your 
faith and mine, the liberty that comes 
from the possession of the Spirit of the 
Lord. 

The first revelation that the Lord 
gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith had 
a bearing upon this subject. You re- 
member that the Prophet went to the 
Lord to ascertain which of all the sects 
of religion was His church, desiring, of 
course, to unite himself with that 
church which the Lord would designate 
as His. In reply to that question the 
Lord, in substance, said that they were 
all wrong; that He did not acknowledge 
them as His church; and told the 
Prophet he must join none of them, 
but promised that in due time He would 
use the Prophet as His instrument in 
the establishment of His Church in 
the earth. Because of this great reve- 
lation, by which the errors of ages were 
swept aside and the ground cleared 
for the re-establishment of the 
Church of Christ among men, it has 
placed us in a way in an attitude of 
antagonism to the religious world. We- 
have been resisted to some extent be- 
cause of this attitude of antagonism; 
and it is quite possible that we our- 
selves have not understood the true re- 
lationship in which we stand to the re- 
ligious world, by more or less of mis- 
apprehension respecting this great rev- 
elation. I rejoice in the plainness and 
emphasis of this revelation, because- 
from it I am made to realize that there 
is a very important reason for the ex- 
istence of the work with which we are 
identified. . I am glad to know that 
"Mormonism" did not come into ex- 
istence because its founders chanced to 
disagree with prevailing notions about 
the form or object of baptism; that it 
did not come into existence through 
a disagreement as to the character or 
the government of the Church. From 
the revelation referred to I learn that 
"Mormonism" came into existence be- 
cause there was an absolute necessilv 



14 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



for a new dispensation of the Gospel, 
a re-establishment of the Church of 
Christ among men. The Gospel had 
been corrupted; its ordinances had been 
changed; its laws transgressed, its 
truths so far lost to the children of men 
that it rendered this new dispensation 
of the Gospel of Christ — miscalled "Mor 
monism" — necessary. I say that I re- 
joice in the fact that "Mormonism" 
came into the world, and exists in the 
world today, because the world stood in 
sore need of it. But does this re-estab- 
lishment of the Church of Christ, ihis 
new dispensation of the Gospel, which 
we have received, make our relation- 
ship to the children of men one of un- 
friendliness? I answer, No. On the 
contrary our relationship to men is 
one of absolute friendship and anxiety 
to do the world good. "We ought to un- 
derstand that. We do understand it. 
And it is important that the world 
should understand it, that they may 
come to regard us in our true light, as 
friends of humanity, and not enemies. 

If you will look through some of the 
revelations given in the early history cf 
the Church, you will find that from time 
to time the Lord was under the neces- 
sity of correcting the ideas of the breth- 
' ren respecting their attitude towards 
religious world. The Lord said to 
Martin Harris, b T ~ way of correction: 

"Thou shalt declare glad tidings, 
yea, publish it upon the mountains, and 
upon every high place, and 
among every people that thou 
shalt be permitted to see. And 
thou shalt do it with all humility, 
trusting in me, reviling not against 
revilers. And of tenets thou shalt not 
talk, but thou yhalt declare repentance 
and faith on the Savior, and remis- 
sion of sin by baptism and by fire, 
yea, even the Holy Ghost." 

The Prophet also from time to time 
found it necessary to correct the El- 
ders of the Charch in respect of their 
attacking other churches. At Kirtland, 
in 18 36, when many of the Elders were 
upon the eve of taking their departure 
for their fields of labor he instructed 
them as follows: 

"While waiting [for the Sacrament] 
T made the following remarks: The 
time that we were required to tarry in 
JtCirtland to be endowed would be ful- 



filled in a few days, and then the El- 
ders would go forth, and each stand 
for himself . . . . to go in all 
meekness, in sobriety, and preach 
Christ and Him crucified; not to con- 
tend with others on account of their 
faith or systems of religion, but pur- 
sue a steady course. This I delivered 
by way of commandment; and all who 
observe it not, will pull down persecu- 
tion upon their heads, while those 
who do, shall always be filled with the 
Holy Ghost; this I pronounced as a 
prophesy." (History of the Church, 
vol. II, p. 431.) 

In other words, because the Lord 
has opened the heavens and has given 
a new dispensation of the Gospel, it 
does not follow that His servants or 
His people are to be contentious; that 
they are to make war upon other peo- 
ple for holding different views respect- 
ing religion. Hence this caution to 
the Elders of the Church that they 
should not contend against other 
churches, make war upon their tenets, 
or revile even the revilers. At an 
earlier date still, the Lord had said to 
Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer: 

"If you have not faith, hope and 
Charity, you can do nothing. Con- 
tend against no church, save it be 
the church of the devil. Take upon 
you the name of Christ, and speak the 
truth in soberness." (Dec. & Cov. Sec. 
18, 19-21.) 

"The church of the devil" here al- 
luded to I understand to mean not any 
particular church among men, or any 
one sect of religion, but something 
larger than that — something world- 
wide — something that includes within 
its boundaries all evil wherever it may 
be found; as well in schools of philos- 
ophy as in Christian sects; as well in 
systems of ethics as in systems of re- 
ligion — something that includes the 
whole empire of Satan — what I shall 
call "The Kingdom of Evil." 

This descriptive phrase, "the church 
of the devil," is also used in the Book 
of Mormon; and while in attendance 
at a conference in one of the border 
stakes of Zion, a question was pro- 
pounded to me in relation to its mean- 
ing. The passage occurs in the writ- 
ings of the first Nephi. An angel of 
the Lord is represented as saying to 
Nephi, "Behold, there are save two

churches only: the one is the church of 
the Lamb of God, and the "Other is the 
church of the devil." The question 
submitted to me was, "Is the Catholic 
church the church here referred to — 
the church of the devil?" "Well," said 
I, in answer, "I would not like to take 
that position, because it would leave 
me with a lot of churches on my 
hands that I might not then be able 
to classify." So far as the Catholic 
-church is concerned, I believe that 
there is just as much truth, nay, per- 
sonally I believe it has retained even 
more truth than other divisions of so- 
called Christendom; and there is just 
.as much virtue, and I am sure there 
is more strength in the Roman Catho- 
lic church than there is in Protestant 
■Christendom. 

I would not like, therefore, to designate 
the Catholic church as the church of 
the devil. Neither would I like to des- 
ignate any one or all of the various di- 
visions and subdivisions of Protestant 
■Christendom combined as such church; 
nor the Greek Catholic church; nor the 
Buddhist sects; nor the followers of 
■Confucius; nor the followers of Mo- 
hammed; nor would I like to desig- 
nate even the societies formed by 
deists and atheists a s constituting the 
•church of the devil. The Book of Mor- 
mon text ought to be read in connec- 
tion with its context— with the chap- 
ter that precedes it and the remaining 
portions of the chapter in which it is 
found— then, I think, those who study 
it in that manner will be forced to the 
conclusion that the Prophet here has 
in mind no particular church, no par- 
ticular division of Christendom, but he 
has in mind, as just stated, the whole 
■empire of Satan; and perhaps the 
thought of the passage would be more 
nearly expressed if we use the term 
"the kingdom of evil" as constituting 
the church of the devil. 

I understand the injunction to Oli- 
ver Cowdery to "contend against no 
church, save it be the church of the 
■devil," to mean that he shall contend 
against evil, against untruth, against 
all combinations of wicked men. They 
constitute the church of the devil, the 
kingdom of evil, a federation of un- 



righteousness; and the servants of God 
have a right to contend against that 
which is evil, let it appear where it 
will, in Catholic or in Protestant Chris- 
tendom, among the philosophical so- 
cieties of deists and atheists, and even 
within the Church of Christ, if, un- 
happily, it should make its appearance 
there. But, let it be understood, we 
are not brought necessarily into antag- 
onism with the various sects of Chris- 
tianity as such. So far as they have 
retained fragments of Christian truth 
—and each of them has some measure 
of truth— that far they are acceptable 
unto the Lord; and it would be poor 
policy for us to contend against them 
without discrimination. Wherever we 
find truth, whether it exists in complete 
form or only in fragments, we recognize 
that truth as part of that sacred whole 
of which the Church of Jesus Christ 
is the custodian; and I repeat that our 
relationship to the religious world is not 
one that calls for the denunciation of 
sectarian churches as composing the 
church of the devil. All that makes for 
untruth, ¥or unrighteousness conlsti- 
tutes the kingdom of evil — the church 
of the devil. All that makes for truth, 
for righteousness, is of God; it consti- 
tutes the kingdom of righteousness — 
the empire of Jehovah; and, in a cer- 
tain sense at least, eonlstitutes the 
Church of Christ. With the latter— 
the kingdom of righteousness — we have 
no warfare. On the contrary both the 
spirit of the Lord's commandments to 
His servants and the dictates of right 
reason would suggest that we seek to 
enlarge this kingdom of righteousness 
both by recognizing such truths as it 
possesses and seeking the friendship 
and co-operation of the righteous men 
and women who constitute its mem- 
bership. 

Running parallel with these thoughts, 
I may be pardoned if I call your atten- 
tion to a remark I made in one of these 
general conferences some time ago, to 
the effect that when misrepresentations 
are made of us, or our faith, or when 
persecution arises against us, it must 
not embitter our minds, or make us 
feel hateful toward our fellowmen, or 
lead us to regard the whole world as

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



our enemies. We must keep the sweet- 
ness of our own disposition. The lan- 
guage of the Savior wherein He says, 
"Marvel not if the world hate you: it 
hated me before it hated you, if you 
were of th e world, the world would 
love its own," etc., I contended then 
and believe now that the truth of 
that declaration Avill be more plainly 
seen if we read it in this way: "Mar- 
vel not if the worldly hate you." If 
the ungodly, if those who make and love 
a lie— if such classes as this hate you, 
marvel not; for they were the classes 
that hated the Christ and the light and 
truth that He brought into the world, 
because their deeds were evil, and His 
light and truth were a reproof to their 
evil ways. And as we say concerning 
the "kingdom of evil," so we say with 
reference to those who hate the truth 
and make war upon the righteous, they 
are not of any one class, or confined 
to any one sect or division of the re- 
ligious world, but, unhappily, are found 
here and there among all classes of 
people, among all Christian sects,among 
all religions and sects of philosophy. 
We ought to rightly divide, not only 
the word of truth, but the wicked and 
the ungodly from those who in com- 
mon with us are seeking to know God 
and to keep His commandments. And 
there are millions who are hungering 
and thirsting for that knowledge; and 
we from time to time shall find them 
and lead them into God's temple of 
truth, where they shall be satisfied at 
the feast that the Lord is preparing for 
all those who hunger and thirst after 
righteousness. 

The purpose of the Lord in institut- 
ing His Church in the earth is very 
beautifully set forth in one of the 
revelations in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, as follows: 

(I discover that I do not readily find 
the passage, and so I pass it for the 
moment.) The thought that I desire to 
express and leave with you, however, 
is this, that as in the matter of phys- 
ical warfare so also In the matter of 
theological contention, I believe it is 
proper for the Latter-day Saints to re- 
nounce war and proclaim peace; not 



to take such a course as would excite 
the antagonism of the world, but seek- 
ing rather such ground-work of truth 
as may be held in common between 
them and ourselves; for the Lord has 
brought forth His work in the last 
days, not for the purpose of subtract- 
ing from such truth as men may pos- 
sess, but to add to that truth, to in- 
crease it, to enlarge it, until at the last 
God, through the agencies He has ap- 
pointed, shall gather together in one 
system all truth. 

The passage I was looking for is 
kindly handed to me, and is as follows: 

"If this generation harden not their 
hearts, I will establish my Church 
among them. 

"Now I do not say this to destroy 
my Church, but I say this to build up 
mv Church. 

"Therefore, whosoever belongeth to 
my Church need not fear, for such shall . 
inherit the kingdom of heaven. 

"But it is they who do not fear me,, 
neither keep my commandments, but 
build up churches unto themselves to 
get gain, yea, and all those that do- 
wickedly and build up the kingdom of 
the devil; yea, verily, verily,- 1 say unto 
you, that it is they that I will disturb, 
and cause to tremble and shake to the 
center." 

I read this in confirmation of the 
word I spoke, saying that the purpose of 
God in the introduction of the Dispen- 
sation of the Fulness of Times was not 
to destroy any truth that existed in 
the world, but to add to that truth, to 
increase it, and to draw together all 
truth and develop it into a beautiful 
system in which men may rest con- 
tented, knowing God and their relation- 
ship to Him, knowing of the future 
and their relation unto it. 

We should present our message to the 
world in the spirit of peace, charity 
and longsuffering; and avoid conten- 
tion; for as our Book of Mormon tells 
us. he that hath the spirit of conten- 
tion is not of God. I would the world 
could understand the unselfisnness of 
our motives in presenting the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ to them; if they could 
only know that our only desire was that 
they should come to a knowl- 
edge of the great principles of

truth that are so comforting to 
us; that we desire their repentance 
and acceptance of the fulness of the 
truth, only that they might find favor 
with God, and share in our hopes of 
that eternal life, which God, who can- 
not lie, promised before the world was — 
if our fellowmen could be made to un- 
derstand that this was our only pmv 
pose, it seems to me that many of the 
barriers that now separate us from our 
fellowmen would be broken down, and 
we would be able to reach the hearts of 
the people. I believe that as time passes 
and we become wiser in the methods 
of work we adopt, we will do that more 
and more, causing yet, not only hun- 
dreds of thousands but millions of our 
Father's children to partake of those 
great blessings that the Gospel has 
brought to us. To make known these 
truths and to make the children of men 
participate in the blessings that we 
ourselves enjoy, we yearly send hun- 
dreds of our Elders to the various na- 
tions of the earth. They sacrifice the 
fond associations of home, the society 
of wives and children, parents and 
friends; they sacrifice professional ad- 
vantages and business opportunities; 
and sometimes sacrifice health and even 
life itself to proclaim to the world thw 
truth which God has made known to us 
—enduring the world's reproach and 
contumely, because the world does not 
understand them nor their message; 
and there is still need, of the prayer 
on our part, "Father, forgive them, 
they know not what they do." For the 
benefit of those who have passed away 
from the earth without a knowledge of 
the great truths and saving power of 
the Gospel of Christ, we rear costly 
temples, whose spires pierce the skies 
of our beloved Utah; and within them 
at great sacrifice of time and means the 
saints of God assemble to apply the 
principles of the everlasting Gospel t& 
those who have passed away withouv 
the privilege of accepting them while 
upon the earth. A more completely 
unselfish work than this does not ex- 
ist among men. On every hand the 
work of God bears the stamp of unself- 
ishness upon it. Our Book of Mormon 
says: "The laborers in Zion shall labor 



for Zion; for if they labor for money, 
they shall perish." So through all the 
communications of God to His people 
shines the glorious principle of absolute 
unselfishness. Not only is it to be 
found in the words of our books, but 
a like testimony is written in the works 
of the Latter-day Saints — in their ac- 
tions. Everywhere unselfishness 
abounds in the Church of Christ, both 
in theory and practice. Now, if we can 
only get the people of the world to un- 
derstand this fact of unselfishness — this 
very genius of Mormonism — if they 
could be made to know that Mormon- 
ism is here to do good, to raise man- 
kind from the low levels on which they 
walk to the higher plains where God 
would have them walk, that they might 
have sweet fellowship with God, much 
of our difficulty in preaching the gospel 
would disappear. That the Lord may 
hasten the day when the world shall 
know the Saints and the work of God 
better, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Lift 
up the voice in singing." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

In the few minutes I occupy I de- 
sire to talk about the Lord's army. 
You know the Lord has an army, 
"Soldiers of the cross," just as the 
United States has a regular standing 
army. The Church of Latter-day 
Saints has an army of soldiers num- 
bering, approximately, 8,000. They 
are minute men, so-called. It is their 
duty to preach the Gospel, continuous- 
ly, among the children of men. They 
belong to the regular army of the 
Church; they are not volunteers; and 
whenever called by divine authority, 
to go to the nations of the earth, they 
are expected to be ready and prepared 
to go. This army of the Lord's soldiers 
go out and battle against the kingdom 
of evil, which Brother Roberts has 
been talking about. Now, my ex- 
perience has taught me that the king- 
dom of evil is not going to lie down 
quietly while we are kicking it. You 
will generally find that enemy quite 
ready for a fight.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Whenever these witnesses are moved 
uijon by the Spirit of the Lord to tes- 
tify that Jesus is the Christ, and Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God, then trou- 
ble begins; they need not attack the 
religions of other churches. I promise 
every Elder who is called by divine 
authority to preach the Gospel, if he 
will testify to those truths he will 
have all the trouble he can stand. 
Furthermore, the Elders must now 
have a little money while traveling 
else their enemies will make it very 
uncomfortable for them. I am inform- 
ed that laws have been passed in cities 
of the Southern States, where thou- 
sands of our Elders formerly traveled 
without purse or scrip, so that if any 
of them are now found in cities asking 
for entertainment, they are placed in 
prison. I believe that some of our 
Elders might do good in prison, as the 
Lord sometimes manifests His power 
in behalf of imprisoned Elders, and 
strengthens their testimonies. 

I am very much interested in this 
army of the Lord, and in order to pre- 
face my remarks I will read some 
statements made at our last confer- 
ence. Following is a quotation from 
the closing address delivered by Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith, Oct. 8, 1905. 

"I feel like blessing the quorums 
of the Priesthood, every one of them, 
from the High Priests to the Deacons. 
I pray God, my Heavenly Father, to 
remember them in their organizations, 
to help them, that they may magnify 
the Priesthood they hold and do the 
will of the Father; that the Seventies 
may be minute men, instant in season 
and out of season, ready and willing 
to respond to the calls that are made 
upon them to go and preach the Gos- 
pel to the world. Gather in from the 
Elders quorums those who have proven 
themselves worthy and who have gain- 
ed experience, and make Seventies of 
them, so that the quorums of the 
Seventies may be replenished; and the 
aged ones, whose physical condition 
will not permit them any longer to do 
missionary duty in the world, let them 
be ordained High Priests and Patri- 
archs, to bless the people and to min- 
ister at home. Gather in the strong, 
the vigorous, the young, the able- 
bodied who have the spirit of the Gos- 
pel in their hearts, to fill the ranks 
of the Seventies, that we may have 
ministers to preach the Gospel to the 



world. They are needed. We cannot 
now meet the demand." 

That is the word of the Lord to the 
Seventies, and to the Presidents of 
Stakes, and Bishops of wards. We 
should search among our young peo- 
ple carefully and advance the worthy 
ones in the Priesthood, so that we can 
replenish the Seventies' quorums with 
good, able-bodied men who are will- 
ing to perform the arduous labors 
connected with preaching the Gospel. 
This labor is difficult; it is hard upon 
the Seventies and Elders, for they are 
sent into all the climates of the earth. 
They go to the islands of the sea, to 
malarial districts, or to high altitudes, 
and unless they are strong and able- 
bodied, they break down physically. 
To illustrate, if you send an Elder to 
Australia, at a cost perhaps of $120, 
and he is sick with rheumatism or 
other ailments, and has to return 
home, all that money is expended and 
very little accomplished. I think Pres- 
ident Smith has told me, personally, 
that to send men out in the missionary 
field who are broken down physically, 
demoralizes the mission. It certainly 
is a great misfortune to break down 
physically while on a mission. If you 
send out a sick Elder with a com- 
panion who is healthy, strong and 
able-bodied, the healthy man is hin- 
dered from performing his labors be- 
cause of the sickness of his partner. 
If there are easy places the sick Elders 
have to be sent there, so I think it is 
sometimes a misfortune to be healthy 
if you have to go to all the hard 
places. I say all hail to the aged 
Seventies who have been faithful, who 
have labored .70 years perhaps, as 
Brother Homer Duncan did. He was 
one of the oldest presidents of Seven- 
ty in the Church; he was senior presi- 
dent of the Third quorum for a great 
many years. He died lately over 90 
years old; and he wanted to die a 
Seventy; there was nothing that could 
change his mind regarding that mat- 
ter. 

It seems to me that some of the aged 
Seventies have a wrong conception 
regarding their change of appointment 
to High Priests, so that they can labor

at home, sleep in their own beds, and be 
cared for by their families This is the 
place for men who are aged, and who 
have been faithful and diligent wit- 
nesses of the Lord. It is not good for 
them to be out in the world, exposed as 
our Elders have to be. I am deeply in- 
terested in that matter, and desire you 
to give it consideration. The Seventies 
are under the direction of the Twelve 
Apostles, who, when they need assist- 
ance in preaching the Gospel, should 
find such help in the Seventies quorums, 
instead of any others, according to the 
revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
But the difficulty is that many of these 
"soldiers of the cross" are aged, phy- 
sically disabled, crippled, and therefore 
unable to go out and perform this la- 
bor, and it would not be wisdom to call 
them. So we need young and healthy 
♦ men. 

I desire to say further that we 
need a little more discipline, and 
more attention to the interests 
of our Seventies. There are seven 
Presidents over eaeh of those quorums 
in the Church, and there are now 148 
quorums; but there is a difficulty that 
I think needs to be looked after The 
Sunday school numbers about .100,000 in 
its membership. The Young Men's Mu- 
tual Improvement Association about 
25,000. These organizations have strong 
General Boards, and there has been a 
wonderful labor performed by them. As 
President Smith stated this morning, it 
cannot be expressed in a few words 
what the Sunday Schools, the Mutual 
Improvement Associations and other 
auxiliary organizations have accom- 
plished. They have been encouraged, 
held together, pushed and crowded to 
their fullest capacity by their energetic 
and capable officers. The Priesthood 
quorums should be foremost in this 
Church, but some of the members have 
become mentally lazy, and have acted 
as if they expected their organizations 
to keep together without effort. The 
auxiliaries have been urged forward 
with, great enthusiasm, everywhere, 
from Canada to Mexico, these organi- 
zations are to the front. The Priest- 
hood quorums are apparently weary in 
well doing, and the officers and mem- 



bers seem to think that their organi- 
zations can run themselves. They have 
become lax in their work, and let loose 
their hold. While the auxiliary organ- 
izations have taken the right of way, 
the Priesthood quorums stand by look- 
ing on awe-struck at the great phalanx 
of young people who are rushing ahead. 
So the auxiliary organizations are going 
away up the hill and we, the Priesthood 
quorums, stand down in the valley and 
look on. Perhaps you don't like that 
picture, you men of the Priesthood 
quorums, but I tell you there is a lot 
of truth in it. 

You owe first allegiance to your quor- 
ums and quorum meetings, for there 
is where you get your authority and 
power. Why is it that we are different 
from other men in the world It is not 
because we have greater knowledge and 
information, but because we hold the 
Priesthood. Why is it that you fathers 
and mothers permit your 18-year-old 
boys to go to South Africa, Australia, 
Germany, or other nations of the earth, 
notwithstanding you are afraid to trust 
them out in this city after dark? It is 
because they hold the Priesthood. Our 
beardless boys are able to defend the 
Church of Jesus Christ, and preach the 
Gospel. They hold divine authority, 
and under their administration the re- 
pentant believer is baptized, receives 
the remission of sins, and the Holy 
Ghost is conferred by the laying on of 
hands. The arm of the Lord is not 
shortened. These boys are sent out in 
His service a«d He has told them to 
think not of the morrow, of what they 
shall eat, or what they shall drink, or 
wherewithal they shall be clothed, for 
He is amply able to take care of them. 
There is no great number of men in 
this Church so carefully looked after, 
and their lives so well preserved, as are 
the Elders who preach the Gospel in the 
world. I am in favor of the Priest- 
hood quorums taking their proper 
places, and if they do not do it, they 
ought to be ashamed of themselves, for 
they have the power and intelligence, 
and they hold the authority. It puts 
me in mind of a story, the only one I 
can think of just now to fit the condi-

tion. It may not be just suitable, but 
I will tell it anyhow: 

A negro had a mule which balked, 
and he could not get it to move; ,so he 
went into a drug store and asked the 
druggist if he had anything that he 
thought would start the mule. The 
druggist came out and injected some- 
thing in the region of the ribs of the 
mule, and immediately thereafter the 
negro s aw a streak of dust and the ani- 
mal flying over the hill. He went back 
to the druggist and said, "How much is 
it? "Twenty-five cents." "Well," said 
he, Just put fifty cents worth in me. so 
I can catch the mule." (Laughter.) 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

In his opening remarks this morning, 
President Smith stated what it was 
[that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints stood for. It was 
for virtue, for honesty, for all that is 
good and holy and right. It was this 
idea that inspired the Apostle James 
when he said, "Pure religion and unde- 
filed before God and the Father is this, 
To visit the fatherless and widows in 
their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world." It was no 
doubt the same thought that inspired 
the words that "faith without works *s 
dead." 

In looking over this great congrega- 
tion and seeing so many of our Father's 
children, my mind is led to contemplate 
the great human family; not only those 
who dwell upon the earth today, but ail 
who have ever trod this planet. When 
our first parents came to this earth 
they partook of the fruit of the tree of 
knowledge, and thereby .learned to 
■ discriminate between good and evil. 
From that day until the present, all 
mankind have come in contact with 
the good and with the evil. Every 
man and woman will appreciate what I 
say when I call attention to the fact 
that this warfare between good and evil 
is known to every one of them. It is 
a battle that we all must fight. With 
that knowledge of good and evil we are 
also in possession of what is known as 



free agency. We can choose the good 
and reject th* evil, or we can choose 
the evil and reject the good. But to ev- 
ery one of us will come the momentous 
queeLion, Which shall we choose? and 
Me shall be called upon to decide. So 
that when the statement is made lhat 
the Chirch of Christ stands for the 
good, it seems to me that that describes 
ou: religion The purpose of our Fath- 
er in heaven in revealing the Gospel of 
Je.v.i.s Cbiist was that He m\%hi con- 
vert the ieople of the world to eschew 
evil pnd to follow the good. It vras that 
we migi t be cleansed and puri'.ied from 
the evil with which we all come in con- 
tact. Sin is in the world, and hu- 
manity to some extent has partaken of 
it. Therefore it became necessary that 
a plan should be devised whereby we 
might be redeemed and saved from the 
consequences of sin. The two influ- 
ences mentioned are abroad in the land. 
One is striving with the children of 
men to save their souls. It is the Spir- 
it of the Lord, that divine essence 
which issues forth from the Father and 
the Son, and is within the reach of ev- 
ery one of us. If we harken to that 
"still small voice" of the Spirit of God, 
'it will lead us in the way of good. 
It will help us to fight the batles of life, 
and finally lead us to salvation. It 
will result in making us good men and 
women, and prompt us to do good to all. 
It will make itself manifest in noble 
deeds, in righteous lives ; it will elevate 
us, and fit and qualify us to be indeed 
the children of God. If, on the other 
hand, we hearken to the evil one.it will 
lead us downward. It will result in the 
doing of evil deeds; will lead us down 
to degradation, and destroy our souls. 

I do not need to advance any argu- 
ment in proof of this. It is something 
that might be called an axiom. It is a 
self-evident truth, and is known to all 
mankind. The grand purpose then is 
that we might be cleansed from sin. 
Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is we 
first principle of life and salvation. The 
Gospel has been revealed to mankind 
in order to enable us to resist the pow- 
ers of evil. It has been called the pow-

er of God unto salvation. A plan of 
redemption was necessary. There are 
many people who say, "Oh, if I lead a 
moral, upright life, that is all that is 
necessary." Supposing- we grant that 
for the sake of the argument, the all- 
important thing is that we shall be 
cleansed. It is, however, impossible for 
us to please God unless we believe that 
He is, and that He is a rewarder of 
them that diligently seek Him. If our 
lives are going to result in righteous 
deeds, it will be because we seek after 
the Lord; in other words, seek after 
that good influence He sends abroad: 
there is no other way to pursue in order 
to be influenced for right. The moment 
we reject that power and influence we 
are on the other side and listening to 
the evil one, who is seeking to destroy 
the souls of the children of men. There^ 
fore, faith is necessary for our salva- 
tion. Faith is necessary for the cleans- 
ing of mankind from sin. There would 
be no motive power, nothing to impel 
us to righteousness, without faith in 
God. There would be nothing to cause, 
.us to fight the evil, if it were not for 
faith in God. That very faith will lead 
us to turn from evil. If we have faith 
in Him, we must believe that He is 
good; and if we would please Him and 
cleanse ourselves, we also must bt- 
good. And that implies an abandon- 
ing, a forsaking, a turning away from 
sin. 

Repentance is a law that has been re- 
vealed for the salvation of mankind, 
and without that there is no salvation. 
No man can be cleansed from sin un- 
less he repents and turns from sin. 
That is a self evident truth. It is also 
true that in order to be truly clean 
we must atone in some way or make 
good for the past. And what can man- 
kind do for that? Her* we stand in 
the position of utter helplessness. What 
man can forgive himself? What man 
can obtain salvation or be cleansed 
from sin, if perchance he has been guil- 
ty all his life of that which is sinful in 
the sight of God? Man is totally help- 
less. And we ought to conceive the fact 
that forgiveness is essential to our sal- 



vation, yet man in and of himself can- 
not obtain that forgiveness. We may 
repent of our evil ways and turn unto 
the Lord; we may have faith in Him; 
but there still remains something that 
we are powerless to overcome— the re- 
sponsibility for the evil that we have 
done. This can only com e by that pow- 
er from on high. Some people have 
thought there was a conflict between 
the Apostle James and the Apostle 
Paul, but I do not regard it as any 
conflict. James said that faith with- 
out works was dead, while Paul wrote 
that by grace we are saved, and that 
not of ourselves, not of works, lest any 
man should boast. My brethren and 
sisters, the grace of God is necessary 
for your salvation and for the cleans- 
ing from sin which we all need. He 
so loved the world that He sent His 
Only Begotten Son, that whosoever 
should believe on Him should not pei- 
ish, but have everlasting life. And 
forgiveness can come from Him, and 
from Him alone. Although He in- 
troduced an ordinance in His Church 
whereby we may obtain forgiveness, 
the main thing is that Jesus came and 
His blood was spilt that we might be 
forgiven of our transgressions, and 
thereby be cleansed. We are told that 
if we walk in the light as He is in the 
light, then shall we have fellowship one 
with another, and the blood of Jesus 
Christ will cleanse us from all sin. 
Without that there would be no cleans- 
ing. And the way that can be done 
must be by our Father in heaven, 
through His divine authority. It can 
only be accomplished by Him personal- 
ly ministering unto us, or by some of 
His constituted authority upon the 
earth, having the right to officiate in 
His nartie, and thereby bring unto us 
remission of sins so that we may be 
cleansed every whit, and that our bod- 
ies may be made fit for the reception 
of the Holy Ghost, to be conferred by 
that same authority, through the laying 
on of hands. 

That, my brethren and sisters, is the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I pray that 
we may all appreciate it and live in

accordance with its principles, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn commencing, 

Guide us, O thou great Jehovah, 
Saints unto the promised land; 



"We are weak, but thou art able, 
Hold us with thy prowerful hand! 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der Andrew Jenson, and conference 
was adjourned to Saturday morning, 
at 10 o'clock. 



SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, April 7, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in his excellent 
word! 

What more can he say than to you he 

hath said — 
fou who unto Jesus for refuge have 

fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder C. F. 

Middleton. 

The choir sang the hymn beginning, 

All hail the glorious day, 

By prophets long foretold, 
When with harmonious lay 
The sheep of Israel's fold 
On Zion's hill his praise proclaim, 
And shout hosanna to his name. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

My brethren and sisters, it affords 
me very great pleasure to meet with 
you in this conference, to see the vast 
number present, and to feel the goodly 
influence which prevails. In standing 
before you this morning I may refer to. 
the missionary laboij of the Church. 
At the present time a large number 
of Elders are being called for this im- 
portant work, and I may say that in all 
my lengthy experience I have never 
known the call for missionaries to be 
answered so willinglv and so readily 
as is the present one. I presume at 
least one hundred and fifty mission- 
aries will leave our borders during this 
month, and in the months immediately 
following the number will be almost 
as large, and names from the Presi- 
dents of Stakes and Bishops still con- 
tinue to reach the President's office. 
I believe I am justified in saying that 
the brethren whose names have been 



suggested show better preparation for 
that labor than I have ever known. 
There is. however, one thing that dis- 
heartens me. just a little, that is, the 
number of young men called who ad- 
mit that they have not been keeping 
the Word of Wisdom. While they say 
they will have no difficult" hereafter 
in observing this law of God, they 
acknowledge that in the past they 
have not done so. This is regretable, 
because it shows the Lrndfncy there is 
among us to neglect 1 hose require- 
ments of the Lord which entail a daily 
sacrifice of our personal desires. We 
often express a willingness to lay our 
all upon the altar of sacrifice, and at 
the same time these matters which in 
the minds of some appear to be of 
minor importance are forgolten or 
slighted; they are not considered of 
sufficient importance for us to live up 
to every day of our lives. I know that 
in our hearts we are readv to meet the 
requirements that the Lord makes of 
us. Some of the answers received by 
the First Presidency are quite pathetic. 
The writers, though expressing the 
difficulties by which they are envi- 
roned, say they will be ready, and that 
they will report at the time mentioned 
to fulfill the requirement of the Lord, 
whatever may be the circumstances 
under which they are placed. No 
doubt, our Church schools have 
had considerable influence in bringing 
about this result, and the missionary 
classes established in our academies 
are no small factor in increasing the 
desire of the brethren to perform mis- 
sionary labor, and in. preparing them 
therefor. We have had quite a large 
attendance at the missionary classes 
in the districts that are remote from 
headquarters, but for some reason, this 
year, the Church schools nearest to 
Salt Lake City, have not had the fulll 
attendance in the missionary classes 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that they have had in former years. 
The schools in the north — in Rexburg, 
in Preston, and other places, have had 
large classes of missionary students. 
The effect of these classes is quite 
pronounced and has much to do with 
the present ready responses to mis- 
sionary calls. You are aware no doubt, 
from reports that have been made 
by the presidents of missions at the 
last few conferences, that they have 
not been supplied with the number of 
men they desired. They could not in- 
deed answer all the calls that were 
made upon them by strangers.nor even 
visit all the members of the Church in 
their missions as frequently as was 
desirable, and the consequence has 
been that some have fallen into the 
background through the want of that 
attention which is necessary in all 
places where our people are estab- 
lished. I am hopeful that this diffi- 
culty will be remedied and that the 
arrival of so many new brethren will 
also increase the vitality and develop 
the labors of the brethren in these var- 
ious missions. 

Referring to a cause nearly akin to 
the missionary work, that of the Sun- 
day schools, I desire to say a few 
words. President Smith asked me if I 
did not think the Sabbath schools were 
in a better condition today than they 
had ever been, and I answered him to 
the effect that I so believed- that I had 
never known the time when taken all 
in all, the schools were doing better 
work than they are now. Our schools 
are increasing in number; and that in 
regard to punctuality, the good order 
maintained, and the methods adopted 
for instructing the children I believe 
we are growing and growing in the 
right direction, each year. Above 
all, I believe that the children 
in the schools are obtaining a better 
knowledge of the Gospel, and that they 
are not losing in the spirit and faith of 
the principles of eternal life. I have 
always regarded, and do today, that 
the first thing most important in con- 
nection with our Sunday schools, and 
indeed with all the other auxiliary or- 
ganizations of the Church, is to make 



Latter-day Saints of our children, to 
develop within them a faith that shall 
grow with increasing years, an under- 
standing faith, a faith that, while it 
appeals to the heart, will also appeal 
to the head, and be able to give a rea- 
son for the hope that is within; not 
a blind obedience, as it is sometimes 
called, but a comprehensive under- 
standing of the revelations of God and 
the work that He is performing in this 
generation i Mans*- of our children are 
wonderfully blest in this direction. 
They have a strong and abiding faith. 
God has, by His Holy Spirit, given it 
to them. They also have an under- 
standing of the history of the Church 
and the reasons for the faith that they 
possess, and are able to talk in a 
sensible manner in regard to the prin- 
ciples of the Church. They are able 
to tell why God has revealed His mind 
and will in these days, and why the 
kingdom of God is being built up, and 
the reason of the opposition which 
Satan and those under his control upon 
the earth are using to overthrow this 
work. Many of them also realize that 
the resons given by our opponents for 
their opposition to the work of God 
in which we are engaged are not the 
real reasons. They realize the reason 
is that in our midst is to be found the 
Priesthood of the true and living God. 
It is that which the emissaries of Satan 
are fighting, it is that which they fear, 
because they know as long as God's 
Priesthood is organized upon the earth 
the purposes of the evil one cannot be 
accomplished, nor can they continue 
unreproved in the lives that so many 
of them are inclined to lead. As was 
said by President Smith yesterday, 
the Gospel stands for righteousness, for 
purity, for truth, for everything that 
is good and desirable, and within the 
pale of the Church is to be found every- 
thing necessary for the happiness of 
man here upon the earth, and for his 
eternal salvation hereafter. There is 
no need of Latter-day Saints going out- 
side of the Church for any good thing, 
for it can all be found in that which 
God has given to us. His plan is per- 
fect and embraces all things that men 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 



25 



should desire to receive and attain to; 
and when men go outside of the Church 
of Jesus Christ for anything that they 
believe will benefit them, it shows that 
they have a narrow, a limited and a 
contracted idea of the Gospel, and do 
not rightly understand its principles 
nor its efficacy for salvation day by 
day and forever. We were told many, 
many years ago by President Young, 
that outside of the Gospel there were 
but three things— death, hell and the 
grave. None of us want either of 
those things. We desire to live, and to 
live forever, with the gift of eternal 
lives granted unto us. Our desires 
are to so live in this probation, that 
when that which is perfect is come we 
shall inherit it, and we shall eventually 
become, through the atonement of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, like unto Him. As 
Christ said, "Be ye perfect, even as I 
and my Father in heaven are perfect." 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
think that my voice is adapted to this 
Tabernacle; possibly many of you can- 
not hear me; so I will not occupy your 
time any longer, but pray God to bless 
you, and to bless all that is done and 
said at this conference; and may much 
good and unity in the midst of the 
Saints result from our coming together 
at this time. I ask it through Jesus 
our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
during the few moments I stand before 
you I may be blessed with the Spirit of 
the Lord, and speak such words to this 
congregation as the Lord would have 
me speak. I have rejoiced very greatly 
in the instructions imparted • by the 
brethren during this conference, and 
I feel in my soul that those who have 
stood before us arid borne testimony 
to the truth of the great work in which 
we are engaged, have been directed 
in their words by the Spirit of the Lord. 
As a people, we are very strong be- 
lievers in the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit, and that man is not able of 
himself, by the wisdom which he pos- 
sesses naturally, to instruct 'he people 
concerning the purposes of the Lord. 



That instruction can only be given to 
the convincing of the people, and to 
the building up of the faith and knowl- 
edge of the Saints, by the power of the 
Holy Ghost. In listening to the re- 
marks that have been made by Elder 
•George Reynolds, in relation to the mis- 
sionaries.some thoughts passed through 
my mind concerning them. It falls 
to -my lot in connection with my breth- 
ren to meet companies of missionaries 
very frequently in the annex of the 
Salt Lake Temple, where they are 
usually set apart for their missionary 
labors, and I have observed, as others 
of the brethren have, that nearly all 
the Elders that go into the world to 
preach the Gospel are young men, and 
very largely men without missionary 
experience— young men who are going 
out from their homes for the first time 
to exercise the authority of the Holy 
Priesthood in calling men to repent- 
ance. I have often felt that it would 
be a very great advantage to mission- 
ary work throughout the world if the 
brethren who are called upon from 
time to time to suggest missionaries 
could mix up with these young men, 
who labor so zealously and faithfully in 
the preaching of the Gospel, a few men 
who have already had missionary ex- 
perience. 

Since the commencement of this 
work there have been thousands of 
men who have operated in the nations 
of the earth in the labors of the min- 
istry, and today, in the communities 
of the Later-day Saints, there are a 
large number of men who in years gone 
by have labored successfully and 
through experience have become com- 
petent in missionary work. I fear that 
when the brethren look for mission- 
aries, they feel that men who have al- 
ready been abroad should not be again 
appointed to these labors, if there are 
other men who have not had this oppor- 
tunity. But I believe it would be a 
very great advantage to the young 
men, and a help to the mission presi- 
dents, and a benefit to the people of 
the world, if the young men could be 
blessed with the companionship and 
assistance of some of the brethren who 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE, 



have formerly had missionary experi- 
ence. Therefore, I suggest to the 
Stake Presidents and Bishops that it 
would be a proper thing to seek for 
some experienced missionaries, that 
those who are without experience may 
have the advantage of their compan- 
ionship, that they may receive the en- 
couragement and strength which would 
naturally come from the help of those 
who are well established in the faith 
of the Everlasting Gospel. During the 
past twenty-five years a great change 
has taken place with our missionaries 
so far as the age of the men who are 
sent to preach the Gospel is concerned. 
I remember that during my first mission 
nearly all of my companions were men 
of experience, and I suppose that was 
the condition of all the missions. It 
was the condition, as far as I was ac- 
quainted, with all the conferences 
throughout Great Britain. Here and 
there a few young men were operating 
as missionaries, but the great bulk of 
the Elders were men who had had ex- 
perience, who had been well trained in 
the principles of the Gospel, and who 
were established firmly in the faith. 
I look back today and thank the Lord 
that it fell to my lot to have compan- 
ionship of that character, to be associ- 
ated with men who related to 
me circumstances in connection 
with their experience in the work 
of the Lord that tended to 
strengthen my faith, and to give 
me courage, and hope. There is abun- 
dant room today for this class of mis- 
sionaries. At the present time they are 
nearly all boys in years; there is only 
now and then a man who has had the 
experience to which I have referred. 
Notwithstanding this, however, these 
young men possess the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood; they have gone out 
by the appointment of our Father in 
heaven, through the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, and it is a wonderful work 
that has been accomplished. It will be 

wonderful in the future; for, as in the 

past, God will take the weak things of 

the world to confound the things that 

are great and mighty. I am, however, 



firmly convinced that if an experienced' 
and accomplished missionary, could go- 
out with every half dozen young men. 
great good would flow from such a com- 
bination, both to the youthful mission- 
aries and to the work of the Lord 
abroad. 

One of the brethren yesterday 
in his remarks intimated that he waj 
glad that "Mormonism" had not been 
established as a result of any disagree- 
ment among men concerning any other 
principle of revealed religion. It was- 
established by divine appointment and 
revelation. When the brother made the 
remark to which I refer I remembered 
a few years ago, in visiting a great 
Catholic church in the Old World, pick- 
ing up a tract written by a Catholic, 
and the .statement upon the cover was- 
'Why I Am a Catholic." In that lit- 
tle tract there was a paragraph which 
read somewhat to this effect: "When 
Martin Luther, and Calvin, and Henry 
VIII commenced their mad career in 
what you Protestants term the 'glori- 
ous reformation,' the true religion was- 
then in the world, or it was not. If 
it was, they committed grievous crimes- 
in making new religions to oppose it. 
If it was not, they were powerless to 
create it. It takes a Christ, not a. 
Luther, to create a Christianity, on 
either supposition therefore, Protest- 
antism is not the true religion of Jesus 
Christ." I was greatly impressed with 
the reading of these words. It certainly 
takes an immortal being, it takes the 
very source of religion, to create re- 
ligion. No man, or combination of men, 
have the intelligence or authority to 
create that Gospel which is the power 
of God unto salvation. I thought how 
glorious is the foundation upon which 
"Mormonism" is built; and well might 
we sing, as we have this morning.. 
"How firm a foundation, ye saints of 
the Lord, is laid for your faith in His 
excellent word." No division, conten- 
tion, or quarreling brought into exist- 
ence the glorious principles we have 
espoused. Joseph Smith approached our 
Father in heaven for information con- 
cerning his soul's salvation, and I have 
never come in contact with any person

opposed to "Mormonism" who could 
find any fault with the statement that 
Joseph Smith approached our Father in 
heaven and pleaded with him for infor- 
mation concerning the Gospel • of His 
Son. What better source could he have 
gone to than the source of light? When 
he could not decide for himself where to 
go to find rest for his soul and the 
means of salvation, what greater pow- 
er could he approach than his Father 
in heaven? In doing 30 he was in strict 
accord with the commandment of that 
Father, and in harmony also with the 
teachings of inspired prophets and 
apostles. Joseph Smith went to the 
only source that could lead him in the 
right path. If the truth was not upon 
the earth he approached the only power 
that could reveal and restore that glor- 
ious truth. That is the foundation 
upon which "Mormonism" rests — the 
foundation of the appearing of the 
Father and the Son to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. We need no better foun- 
dation. We need look to no other 
source of power for the means of salva- 
tion. And this marvelous revelation to 
which Joseph Smith bears record, and 
to which we bear record, has come in 
fulfillment of the promises made 
through the mouths of all the proph- 
ets, and through the promise of the Re- 
deemer Himself, for He predicted that 
before His second coming the same 
Gospel should again be proclaimed as a 
sign of that event. My brethren ana 
sisters, this Gospel has not come to us 
in the enticing words of man's wisdom, 
but in the power and demonstration of 
the Holy Ghost. We have not been 
persuaded by the logic of man to re- 
ceive the truth, but we have been per- 
suaded by the convincing power of the 
Holy iSpirit. No wonder men do not 
succeed who proselyte in our midst. 
We cannot be turned from the wh e at of 
the word of God, to the chaff that 
comes from the wisdom of man. We 
have received that form of doctrine 
which is the power of God unto salva- 
tion, as taught by the Redeemer, and 
we can be assured and happy in the 
knowledge that we have set our hands 



to the plow, and that we have laid 
hold of the "iron rod!" We need not be 
moved by the clamor of those who op- 
pose the truth, but we can feel that we- 
have received that which the Lord in- 
tended us to have, and that we are in 
the same position as the apostles of" 
old when the Savior asked them, after 
a number had forsaken him, "Will ye- 
also forsake me?" Their answer was 
"Where shall we go, for Thou hast 
the words of eternal life?" Where can. 
we go to find peace, and comfort, and 
hope, if we turn from the truth? No- 
where. Think of it, and be faithful 
and true to that which we have es- 
poused. I joyfully bear my testimony, 
in connection with my brethren, to the- 
truth of this marvelous work. It is- 
the power of God. It is not a delusion, 
it is not a myth. It is the work fore- 
told by the Prophets, and it will pre- 
vail. God help us to do our part and 
to be true, steadfast, loyal and faith- 
ful to His work, and to our convenants 
with our Father in heaven and with- 
each other, is my prayer through » 
Jesus Christ. Amen;

Reminiscence of missionary call and ex- 
perience.— Necessity for preparation to 
go on missions. — Good and evil monitors

influences, and follow the good. 

My brethren and sisters, it is truly- 
a surprise to me to be called to addresb 
you on this occasion, but I have lis- 
tened attentively to that which we have- 
heard so far during this Conference, 
and can bear you my testimony that 
what has been said has been true and' 
guided by the inspiration of the Holy- 
Spirit. While Brother McMurrin was 
speaking in regard to missionaries, my 
mind reverted to the time when I was- 
called on a mission. I had been in poor 
health for about a year, and was called 
to go to Scandinavia. My financial cir- 
cun.istances were very low, I had no- 
means with which to purchase trans- 
portation, etc., and there was no rail- 
road here at that time to travel on,. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



so I saddled my horse, mounted it, and 
started on my mission to Scandinavia 
w ill) out purse or scrip. On the road I 
fold my horse for a little money, and I 
met some friends who further assisted 
m?. I left here on the seventeenth of 
May and arrived in Copenhagen on the 
twelfth of September, safe and sound. 

But that is not the point exactly 
which occurred to my mind. Speaking 
of the young Elders who are called up- 
on missions, L desire to say that it is 
necessary for them to inform their 
minds while at home. They should at- 
tend the Mutual Improvement Asso. 
ciations, study the Scriptures and the 
Church works, that they may be pre- 
pared for missionary labor when they 
go to their fields. On my arrival I be- 
gan to think, What are you here for? 
Why have you left your home and 
traveled this distance? The answer 
cf.me to me, To preach the Gospel and 

lighten those who are in darkness, 
to assist in gathering scattered Israel, 
and the honest in heart from among the 
wicked. The next question I asked 
myself was, What will you say to 
them? What are the principles of the 
Gospel? In less than an hour I had 
asked myself a hundred questions and 
could not answer one of them. So I 
began to study. Once in a while I 
turned to the man who was presiding, 
and asked him certain questions, which 
he answered without hesitation. Says 
I, "Is that the correct answer to thai 
question?" "Yes," said he. Well, 1 
knew it as well as he did, when I came 
to think of it. A great many of our 
missionaries are not entirely ignoranv 
of the principles of the Gospel, but they 
do not give them proper thought. They 
do nqt study the different questions 
and the proper answers, in order that 
they may be pepared to meet the oppo- 
sition of the world and speak intelli- 
gently to those whom they are called 
upon to address. It has been my prac- 
tice for years to advise young men to 
sludy, to inform their minds, and be 
piepared for the ministry when the call 
comes. 

Often in my official duties, when peo- 



ple come to me for their blessings, es- 
pecially young men who are called up- 
on missions, I admonish them to learn 
to listen to the whisperings of the 
good Spirit and be guided by it; to 
seek the Father for the gift of disv 
cernment, that they may not be de- 
ceived by the evil one, for we under- 
stand that when we would do good evil 
is present with us. It is necessary 
that we should learn to recognize the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit, that we 
may understand the difference between 
it and the evil one. In my labors, I 
have often had the two spirits to con- 
tend with, and this has taught me to 
listen, so that when a question is asked 
I may, through prophetic vision, un- 
derstand the proper answer. Often 
when I have asked questions under 
these circumstances I have heard dis- 
tinctly, it may be said, two voices, and 
they are so near alike that it is a hard 
matter to distinguish between them un- 
less you are acquainted and have learn- 
ed to be guided by the proper spirit. I 
contend that every Latter-day Saint 
has a Monitor within him, and if he 
conducts himself in such a manner that 
he himself is truly satisfied with his 
labors, then he may feel assured the 
Lord is apt to be satisfied. We can 
never do wrong unless we are admonish- 
ed that it is wrong. Before we take a 
wrong step or do something that we 
should not do, that Monitor will chide 
us and will give us a chance to reflect 
if we will accept the opportunity. 
There is, therefore, no reason why the 
Latter-day Saints should do wrong, 
if they will only be guided by the whis- 
perings of God and the Spirit. 

I don't feel like talking longer. I 
ask God our heavenly Father to let 
His blessings rest upon us all, to guide 
us in the true path, to open the eyes of 
oui understanding, that we may see 
aright, that we may comprehend the 
will of the Father, and have fortitude 
to press forward filling our missions 
and accomplishing the work assigned 
u;-?. That the blessings of the Lord may 
rest upon all Israel, is my prayer in th<. 
name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

The leaders in the Church at home neces- 
sarily men of business, as well as coun- 
selors in spiritual affairs.— In the build- 
ing up of Zion, temporal matters must 
receive great attention.— Joseph Smith 
and Brigham Young notable examples of 
temporal and spiritual inspiration.— Z. 
C. M. I. and the sugar industry tangible 
evidences of the benefit of following the 
advice of the Church leaders. 

Brethren and sisters, I desire, the 
few moments that I may occupy, to be 
guided by the Spirit of the Lord In my 
remarks, that I may be inspired to say 
something that shall be edifying to 
those who are present. This is a very- 
large congregation. We have repre- 
sentatives here this morning, I pre- 
sume, from all the stakes of Zion, 55 
in number, and representatives from 
many of the missions of the world, of 
which there are 21. We have repre- 
sentatives also from a great number 
of the 600 or 700 wards of the Church. 
There are before us a good many of 
the presidencies of the stakes of Zion, 
and I would like to say a word in re- 
lation to these leading men. They are 
very practical men, well acquainted 
with the affairs of life; men of ex- 
perience, and understanding, occupied 
in various avocations; men who are 
called to be spiritual and temporal 
leaders of the people; men who should 
be and no doubt are, able by their 
experience, to give counsel and to di- 
rect. Among them are farmers, stock- 
men, contractors and builders, masons, 
carpenters, blacksmiths, merchants, 
lawyers, educators, literary men — and 
all of them preachers of the Gospel. 
They are so situated that they must 
provide for their families and educate 
their children, and of necessity they 
have adopted these various callings, 
either as professional men, tradesmen 
or mechanics. This is all very well 
and good, and proper, we think. They 
do not give their entire time to the 
Church because they are not situated 
so they can. I presume there is enough 
work in the Church to take their en- 
tire time, if they could give it, but they 
cannot give it, and it may be that the 
Lord does not design at present that 
they should do so. For this reason they 



must be practical men, acquainted with 
the affairs of life and be prepared to 
give counsel when it is sought. 

Now, brethren and sisters, there is 
a spiritual side to the Gospel, and 
there is a temporal side, and it is diffi- 
cult to find a dividing line. I do not 
know that there is any dividing line, if 
so, I have never been quite able to dis- 
cover it. I suppose we may say firstly 
spiritual and secondly temporal, and 
then again, perhaps, firstly temporal 
and secondly spiritual; for the last shall 
be first and the first shall be last. 
These men, by their experience, are 
qualified to be spiritual leaders of the 
people, to expound the Scriptures and 
teach them the way of life; and their 
experience also qualifies them to be 
temporal leaders of the people, and to 
give them counsel in matters pertain- 
ing to their temporal interests. We 
have colonizers among these presidents 
of stakes — men who can blaze the way 
in the wilderness and subdue the soil, 
and in part subdue the elements also; 
who can build up the country and suc- 
cessfully establish the Saints, by the 
wisdom of their counsel, in these new 
countries. There is one president of a 
stake (I do not know but he reported 
the fact at one of our conferences) 
who took hold of a business enterprise 
that was something like $2 0,000 in 
debt. It was given into the charge of 
this president of a stake, this spiritual 
leader of Latter-day Saints, and inside 
of two or three years, by his wisdom, 
experience, and ability, the enterprise 
was pulled out of debt. The custom- 
ers were invited to come and trade on 
a cash basis; the counsel went from 
that president to his people to do their 
business on that line.jpay as they went 
along, and the result was as stated. I 
take it, brethren and sisters, that such 
is a part of the Gospel, at least it seems 
so to me. I hope every president of a 
Stake, and Counselor, and High Coun- 
cilor, are teaching this doctrine to the 
Latter-day Saints, and encouraging 
them to get out of debt and keep out. 
That is a part of the word of the Lord 
to the Latter-day Saints. This prac- 
tical man has given us a splendid illus- 



-30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tration of this; and if he was able, by 
•the skill and ability which God had, 
given him, to pull that business out of 
iits embarrassment, surely he was in a. 
position to give counsel to others in the, 
same direction. This is only one case. 
These other Presidents of Stakes who • 
sit before us, with their Counselors, 
are also leading, practical men. They 
•are not one-sided, not narrow-minded, 
they are not men of only one idea, but 
they have comprehensive views of life. 
So it seems necessary, in the provk 
•dence of God, that these men should 
engage in the affairs of life, and be 
practical. 

It is much the same with the mis- 
sionaries whom we are sending out 
into the world. Some of them, it is true, 

•are very youthful, some unmarried; but 
many of them are men of experience 
in temporal as well as in spir- 
itual affairs. Our missionaries are 
not trained theologians, they have 
no diplomas from theological semin- 
aries; but they are picked up just as 
we find them. They are taken from the 
workshop, the store, the farm, thfe. 
schoolroom, the office, from the vari- 

•ous avocations of life, wherever the 
Lord selects them, and they are sent 

-abroad to preach the Gospel. But 
many of them, perhaps the majority, 

-are practical men. They are not men- 
tally floating around in the clouds, 
away "beyond the bounds of time and - 
space," they are in the world, dealing 
with worldly things, as well as with 
spiritual things. It often happens that 
our missionaries sit down and expound 
the scriptures, and teach the word 01 
eternal life, and then, if occasion re- 
quites, turn from that exalted employ- 
ment go into the field, take hold of the 
plow and turn a furrow, or go to tht 
cfs-Tcnter's bench and engage in build- 
ins. This is often done by our mis- 
sionaries when help of that kind is 
needed, and perhaps cannot be obtained 
otherwise by those who are interested 
in the Gospel. In Samoa, on the Sand- 
wich Islands, or on other islands of 
the aea, if a meeting-house is required 
the missionaries assist in building it. 
When it is built and furnished by the 



work of their own hands, they enter tht, 
pulpit and preach the Gospel. I call 
that good, practical religion. It appeals 
to me, and I admire it. I am happy 
to know that our Elders are not 
ashamed of honest toil. I am happy 
to know that these Presidents of Stakes 
and their Counselors, the High Coun- 
cilors, the Bishops of "Wards and their 
Counselors (who are just as practical 
every whit as the Presidents of Stakes) 
are not ashamedto engage in honest la- 
bor. What would you think of 
a President of a Stake with 
his coat off, clad in over- 
alls, following the plow, turning up the 
soil, cultivating it, and then, after a 
hard day's toil, going to a conference, 
or a meeting, and preaching the Gospel 
of Christ to the people of his stake? 
Would you not think it a commendable 
thing? Could he set a better example 
to his people than that? I think not. 
I rejoice in such things. This is Zkm, 
brethren and sisters; and Zion is not 
only the pure in heart, but it is a lo- 
cation, also. Zion consists of cities, 
towns and villages, containing build- 
ings for various purposes; and event- 
ually it will include the holy city ana 
the mighty temple of God which is to 
be built. Those are temporal affairs. 
It means hard work, application, devo- 
tion, sacrifice of means and time; and 
it will require the physical and spirit- 
ual strength and power of the people 
of God. Zion is to flourish upon the 
nil]?, and it will be made to flourish in 
just this way. 

Another thing, brethren and sisters. 
(I am not going to tell you something 
you do not know, I am simply going 
to remind you of something that is 
familiar to you). I have spoken of 
these leaders in Zion who stand at 
the head of stakes and wards, and who 
preside over the people in the church. 
I have been saying to you that they 
are practical men of affairs. Now let 
me say to you that the general author- 
ities of the Church are included among 
those practical men, and have been 
so from the beginning. Have they 
been spiritual men? Yes; the Lord 
knows they have been and are spirit- 



* 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON.

-ually-minded. Have they been tem- 
poral, practical men? Yes; the Lord 
■knows, and you know they are and 
have been. You take the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the great prophet of the 
nineteenth century. We have been 
told here, and it is true, that the 
Father and the Son appeared to him. 
■God spake to him, and gave mighty 
revelations and glorious manifesta- 
tions to the Church through him; yea 
the divine revelations that are pub- 
lished in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, and I tell you we have not 
yet begun to appreciate their depths. I 
doubt if we can fully comprehend 
them in mortality. They are all true, 
.•all from the Lord, and have been ac- 
cepted and adopted by the Church. 
We understand them in part. We have 
glorious glimpses of the future through 
these revelations. Was Joseph Smith a 
rspiritually-minded man? Yes. Was 
he a temporal, practical man? Yes. 
^Besides his labors of a spiritual char- 
acter, he engaged in the founding 
of cities, in establishing the. Latter- 
day Saints in their homes, advising and 
directing their labors and movements, 
temporal as well as spiritual. He 
founded the beautiful city of Nauvoo, 
and was the mayor thereof. Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, mayor of the City 
of Nauvoo! Yes, and lieutenant-gen- 
eral of the Nauvoo Legion, a military 
man, and he had the spirit and cour- 
age of a great leader. He was a lead- 
er as a military man, as a temporal 
man, and as a spiritual man. He was 
broad and liberal in his views; and if 
he had not been disturbed and inter- 
rupted in his plans, Nauvoo would 
have been one of the most glorious 
cities ever founded in this country. 
The people there are now anxious to 
have us go back and give them the 
benefit of some of the practical things, 
which they see we are doing in this 
•country. President Brigham Young, 
who succeeded Joseph Smith, was a 
Practical man. He was a Prophet, 
Seer and Revelator, and he was a 
linancier and colonizer. There was 
3. wonderful combination in President 
Young's characters He was just the 



man suited to the times, fitted to the 
occasion; was right on hand when 
God wanted him. How intensely prac- 
tical was Brigham Young, and yet how 
spiritually-minded! I do not know 
that we ever had a man in the Church 
who, in some respects, was more spirit- 
ually-minded; certainly no man was 
ever more practical in his views and 
counsels. I could not do justice to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, or to Brigham 
Young, if I stood here and talked 
for 10 hours, the theme is too big for 
me. But we know many of the things 
that these men did. One great prac- 
tical thing that President Young did 
was the establishment of that' splendid 
institution near the corner here known 
as Z. C. M. I. He sought to develop 
the principle of co-operation among 
this people. He counseled it, directed 
it, and gave his soul to the movement 
so far as it was necessary. He im- 
pressed its importance and advantages 
upon the hearts of the people. And 
what a terrific struggle Z. M. C. L had! 
It almost went under during the great 
panic of those early days, and its stock 
went down to about 35 cents on the 
dollar. Where is it now? Why, it is 
soaring so high that it can scarcely be 
obtained. It is away beyond par. 
Erigham Young counseled the Latter- 
day Saints to hold their Z. C. M. I. 
stock and not to sell it. That 
is what this practical Prophet 
said to the people, and those 
that followed his counsel did well, 
because the stock has been steadily 
advancing, and the institution is most 
powerful and influential today. It has 
been able to steady the market in this 
country and to regulate prices. Of 
course, there are other strong institu- 
tions here, not only among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, but among our friends 
in this city; but Z. C. M. I. dates back 
into the early years, and it was a great 
movement, in fact, it was ahead of the 
times. During the past year Z. C. M. I. 
did a business of about four and a half 
millions of dollars, and it is giving em- 
ployment to about five hundred persons, 
and is paying to these employes about 
$250,000 every year. In view of these 



32 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



facts you can answer whether Z. C. M. 
I. is essential to this country and peo- 
ple, whether it is helpful to them, 
whether it is worthy of their sympathy 
and support. 

A word in relation to the manufac- 
turing departments of Z. C. M. I., which, 
it seems to me, are, very important fac- 
tors. I do not know whether the Lat- 
ter-day Saints fully understand it or 
not, but it should be known that it is 
quite an extensive feature of the busi- 
ness. Last year something like 80,500 
pairs of boots and shoes were manu- 
factured by Z. C. M. I. — a product of 
home industry, made right here! Is 
not this a satisfaction, and worthy of 
our attention and thought? Then there 
is the overall department. I read in the 
Deseret News last fall, from a report 
made at the Fair, that Z. C. M. I. had 
manufactured soniething lilae 216,000 
dozen pairs of overalls in the past 
year. They had taken the denims, cut 
it up, and made it into overalls, giving 
employment to the people, helping to 
sustain their families, as well as add- 
ing to the success of . the institution. 
And this great principle of co-opera- 
tion and home manufacture was set 
forth by Brigham Young; but that is 
only one instance of his practical work 
and teaching. 

Those who have succeeded President 
Young have also been practical men. 
Brother John Taylor, in an early day, 
under the direction of President Young, 
brought sugar manufacturing machin- 
ery from France, and an effort was 
made to establish the sugar industry in 
this country. But the machinery then 
was very imperfect and could not be 
used to advantage. Thousands of dol- 
lars were expended in its purchase and 
to bring it across the water and the 
plains in order, if possible, to estab- 
lish the sugar industry here. That is 
a temporal matter. Would you call it 
commercialism? Whatever you call it, 
I know it is a glorious thing, and very 
practical. The motive was to benefit 
and bless the people, and put them on 
a self-sustaining, self-supporting basis, 
so that this would indeed be Zion to 
them. But this question of manufac- 



turing sugar did not end with the ef- 
forts of President Young and President 
John Taylor. It was too important, it 
could not rest, so it comes up again, 
like Banquo's ghost. Like the Phoenix, 
it has arisen from the ashes of the 
past, and has become a settled indus- 
try. But few among this great congre- 
gation know the effort it cost to estab- 
lish these sugar factories in the land. 
Many sleepless nights were given to 
consideration of this subject by Pres- 
idents Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and 
Joseph F. Smith. This question of 
manufacturing sugar rested upon them 
tremendously. It was like an inspira- 
tion, they could not get away from it. 
They called the Presidents of Stakes 
and their Counselors together (I re- 
member it very well) and appealed to 
them, and through them to the Church, 
to give this enterprise heartfelt sup- 
port and approval. And when it seem- 
ed that it must be abandoned circum- 
stances being such that it looked as if 
the enterprise would fail, and the 
Church being involved so that it could 
not altogether render the help needed, 
a few of the leading brethren would 
not relinquish it, and the President 
of the Church said it must not fail. 
My brethren and sisters, you know the 
result, you know in general the status 
of this great industry. I could not 
speak in detail of all the su- 
gar factories, for they are 
multiplying on every hand; but I will 
speak of the Utah Sugar Company, be- 
cause that is the pioneer company in 
Utah, and it includes the factories at 
Lehi and at Garland. Let me tell you 
something of what they did last year. 
They manufactured something like 
thirty million pounds of sugar, from 
sugar beets grown upon our soil. These 
beets were not imported from distant 
countries, they were grown here by our 
farmers. What a tremendous power 
that is for good in the temporal affairs 
of this people! Think of the effort that 
has been put forth! Think of what it 
means to the community! It means 
that something like 450 employes were 
engaged in this work, and that $178,000 
was paid to these employes, to help 
sustain them and their families, to 



ELDER KEPHI PRATT. 



33 



provide food, raiment and edu- 
cation for their children. It means 
that something like $62 0,000 was 
paid out in cash to the farmers of this 
State for beets. Could you put your 
soil to better use! Could you cultivate 
it more profitably, you farmers of the 
State? Here is $620,000 realized by the 
people to help them, and to build them 
up temporally. I call that Gospel. The 
world may call it what they please, I 
call it a part of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Twenty-five thousand dollars 
was Paid to the railroads of this State 
for the transportation of beets; $36,000 
was paid for labor connected with the 
raising of beets by the factory, making 
a total that was paid out on the beet 
account alone of something like $682,000 
—all for the good and benefit and bless- 
ing of the people of Zion. That is one 
of the ways Zion is being built up. 

So I say that our leaders of today are 
practical men, spiritual and temporal 
men. They are prepared to give coun- 
sel to the Latter-day Saints in all mat- 
ters that interest them in the building 
up of Zion. I rejoice in it, and it is jusi 
as much a testimony to me of the 
truth of the Gospel as any testimony 

1 have ever had. Yet I know that this 
is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
God. I know that these practical men 
who have succeeded him— Brigham 
Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, 
Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith- 
have been inspired leaders of the peo- 
ple, Prophets of God, and they have 
been and are worthy of pur support, 
both temporally and spiritually. God 
bless you. Amen.

We thank thee, O God for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays.

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

Brethren and Sisters: I feel grate- 
ful indeed for the privilege of attend- 
ing this great conference of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I 
feel like I had dropped from my 
shoulders the cares and responsibilities 
of the mission field, and had come to 
Father's house, to be blessed and 
strengthened in my faith and feelings, 
and have my heart enlarged, my faith 
increased, and be prepared to go back 
to my mission enjoying an increased 
portion of the Spirit of God, to con- 
tinue my labors in that field. We have 
in the Northwestern States mission a 
membership of about 800 souls. We 
have labored for three years, and 
more, in the large cities, traveling in 
the summer, spring and fall through 
the lanes, string-towns and country 
places, and have disseminated the Gos- 
pel as far as we could to about 2,500,- 
000 of our fellow citizens. We have 
oftentimes felt appalled at the indif- 
ference manifested in the larger cities 
of that section of country, and we 
have some times thought that all had 
been done there that ought to be done 
to inform the people concerning the 
Gospel which has been restored to the 
earth again to bring man to the knowl- 
edge of the truth; but I am glad that 
we did not abandon these fields. Al- 
ways we had a doubt whether we 
ought to shake off the dust from our 
feet against some of the cities in the 
northwest. When we have felt dis- 
couraged, and almost shed tears be- 
cause of their indifference, something 
has with- held us from taking away 
the Elders from these districts, ex- 
cept in some few cases for a short 
time. And now the wisdom of the con- 
tinuation of our labors has manifested 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



itself, and the Lprd has poured out 
His power upon that people, in towns 
and cities where we formerly could 
get no hearing, and has brought to 
pass many marvelous things, and we 
are gathering in here one and there 
one noble, independent spirit. 

In Portland, on Feb. 4, we baptized 
seven souls, and last Sunday we bap- 
tized three others. We went around 
the mission baptizing people every- 
where. We made an opening in the 
city of "Vancouver, B. C, where about 
18 people applied for baptism, whereas 
two years ago we could not get a hear- 
ing there at all. In one' city where 
for a time we withdrew the Elders be- 
cause of the indifference manifested, 
viz., Spokane, in Washington, the Lord 
has poured out His Spirit upon the 
people since the Elders have gone back 
there, and His providence has been 
manifested until the spirit that is lead- 
ing some of the people indicates that 
we shall reap a harvest in that town. 

One man who had a Latter-day 
Saint wife, and had prevented her 
from making her membership known 
to the Elders, lost her by death. He 
had in his family six children, partly 
grown. His wife's last request was 
that he would hunt up the "Mormon" 
Elders that they might perform the 
funeral services, and preach the dis- 
courses. He hunted up two of our 
boys that had not been in the mission 
but a few months. They were bashful 
young men, with stammering tongues, 
uneloquent, and he asked them if they 
would come and perform the duties 
of the funeral services over his 
wife. They were so frightened when 
they promised to do it that they fast- 
ed and prayed for two days, and then 
when they went to the funeral their 
tongues were loosed, and the Spirit and 
power rested upon them until the 
hearts of the people in the congregation 
were melted. The husband came seek- 
ing forgiveness that he had manifested 
such a spirit of bitterness against the 
Saints, and invited his children to come 
with him. They became investigators 
of "Mormonism," and the last I heard, 



a week ago, they had given in their 
names for baptism. 

A lady twelve miles out of that city, 
whose husband we have baptized, sent 
him to find the elders, as she had dis- 
covered something with which she 
could overturn "Mormonism," and shb 
wanted first to show the elders the er- 
ror of their ways, and then she intend- 
ed to go about and influence the neigh- 
borhood against the work that the el- 
ders had been doing. When they had 
engaged in a conversation about four 
hours her oldest son arose and said, 
"Mother, instead of your proving that 
Mormonism is wrong, by your con- 
versation you have proved to my broth- 
er and I that it is divine, and 'if the 
water is not too cold for Elder Holli- 
day, he can baptize me tomorrow morn- 
ing." Elder Holliday led the youn& 
man into the water the next day, and 
confirmed him a member of the Church 
in the presence of his mother. 

We have a few disgruntled ministers 
of various churches that feel hard to- 
wards us for the work that we are do- 
ing in Vancouver, and other places; taut 
we do not mind the opposition, and feel 
always that God has some good people 
where opposition arises in its strength 
and attempts to block up the way of 
this work. 

The newspapers in my district are 
very kind to us, except a few. They 
publish for us many good things, and 
seldom publish anything against us. 
They seem to be ashamed of some 
things that are published against us in 
one place and another, and they are 
generally friendly towards us. Our mis- 
sion is more prosperous and there is a 
greater degree of the good spirit from 
the unseen word operating upon the 
people than at any time since I have 
been laboring there. The Elders and 
Saints feel it, and we all feel that the 
Lord is working there, and that we 
shall lead many good people into the 
waters of regeneration. 

I thank my brethren and this people 
for this privilege of speaking to you, 
and I pray the Lord that He will bless 
this people and all those who bless 
tbtm. I want to say to you that the

mirsioraries of this Church are hunting 
the world over with all the might and 
strength and .discernment that we have, 
because souls are precious to us. How 
do you take care of the converts and 
show forth an example unto them when 
they come here? There are missionary 
societies here that hold reunions of 
Elders from the various mission fields 
in the United States and Europe. When 
I send converts here, if the North- 
western States Missionary association 
will take them and introduce them to 
the Bishop of the ward where they 
will live, so that they may be known 
here and be given the hand of fellow- 
ship by the Saints of God, and not stray 
around these streets like sheep without, 
a shepherd, it will be one of the best 
things that you can do, and will help 
us very materially. 

Gog bless the people of Zion in all 
their abiding places. 'I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

It is very gratifying to me, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to be with you at this 
conference. It is also a pleasure to 
speak on conditions in California. We 
have about 600 members in that mission; 
at least that number are enrolled as 
members, but a few of them we can not 
place. Some are not as faithful as they 
might be, but on the whole they are a 
select set of people. It is most grati- 
fying to note month after month and 
sometimes week after week, the faith- 
fulness and stability of the Saints in 
tithes and offerings. The tithing records 
of the mission show that there are 
scores who have their names enrolled, 
and a person can tell at a glance the 
wages they receive from month to 
month, because of the accuracy and 
strictness with which they pay their 
tithes and offerings. 

During the past winter we have been 
doing a little missionary work in that 
part of Arizona which lies outside the 
organized stakes of Zion, principally 
in the mining camps, and over the bor- 



der into one or two mining camps of 
Old Mexico. Great joy has come to us 
in our missionary labors there in meet- 
ing with sons and daughters of Latter- 
day Saints, who work in those camps, 
and who have not had the privilege of 
meeting with the Saints in Sabbath 
meetings. I feel that a great deal of 
good has been done to our children in 
this way, which will help them to fight 
the good fight and keep the faith, while 
they are isolated from the body of the 
Church. 

Recently we have endeavored to make 
the Saints who are visiting at the sea- 
side resorts in California feel at home, 
by holding meetings in their cottages. 
At Ocean Park we have rented a hall, 
and meetings are held there each Sab- 
bath. 

A great deal of the work which we 
do is as much in the interest of the 
eastern missions as our own; for Cali- 
fornia, during the winter season, is 
ifrequented by thousands of visitors 
from the east. We meet them in our 
tracting, they hear us upon the streets 
when we hold meetings, and they carry 
back to the eastern states our tracts, 
and in many instances ascertain the ad- 
dresses of the mission houses in various 
cities of the east. They fellowship us, 
and treat us in a fraternal manner, 
Avhich they would not do at home, so 
they frequently say themselves, for fear 
perhaps of losing caste, or arousing the 
criticism of their friends because of 
their friendliness to the "Mormon" El- 
ders. But they come out west for 
health or for recreation, and they are 
willing to see all that is to be s eeen, and 
to hear all that is to be heard. While 
in some cases it is an abnormal curios- 
ity that brings them to our gatherings, 
yet in the end they are robbed of pre- 
judices, and return home with friendly 
feelings towards us and our people. 
I do not believe that an instance can 
be named where they have given us a 
hearing, and have noted the good spirit 
that our young men possess, but they 
have gone away more friendly, if not to 
the whole body of the Church, at least 
to those they have come in contact 
with.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is thought by some that we are 
held in contempt by all the people of 
the world, but my testimony is that, 
in nearly six years of experience upon 
the Pacific coast, only in one instance 
can I say that I have been discrimin- 
ated against because I was a Latter- 
day Saint. So far as I am concerned, 
it has been the reverse; honors have 
been given to me, and people have in- 
terested themselves in me, because of 
my position in the Church, and the peo- 
ple whom I represent. I have had ex- 
tended to me, on various occasions, 
marks of respect and esteem that have 
been helpful and gracious indeed. Re- 
cently I had the privilege of convers- 
ing with a very prominent man, who 
is looked upon as a rising light in his 
political party. My soul was made to 
rejoice when parting with him, for 
he kindly grasped my hand and put 
his arm upon my shoulder and 
said: "When you see John Hen- 
ry Smith give him my love., 
and tell him that I just think 
the world of him." Tuesday last I was 
talking with another influential gentle- 
man. He bore unwitting testimony to 
the fact that Isaiah was a prophet, for 
in reviewing the work which our people 
had done he said: "I want to tell you, 
Elder Robinson, that it is a marvelous 
work and a wonder." Yet he is not a 
religious man, but he is conversant 
with what our people have done, and 
particularly Avith the economic side of 
"Mormonism." I might also mention 
Honorable W. E. Smythe.who has writ- 
ten many friendly articles in relation 
to our people and their work. I might 
refer to Benjamin Fay Mills, the pastor 
of the Fellowship League club of Los 
lAngie,les, which numbers amjong its 
members some of the leading lights of 
the literary and scientific world. They 
are building up a so-called church, bas- 
ed upon the sermon delivered upon the 
Mount, but do not recognize Christ as 
the Messiah. Mr. Mills, in talking to 
me, said: "We are laboring for the 
same end, but along different lines, and 
I must say that I can not but respect 
,your people for their integrity and 
stability, and that which they have 



wrought in this western country: al- 
though there are some of the tenets 
which they teach in common with other 
churches, both orthodox and unortho- 
dox, that I do not agree with, or at 
least do not understand." Recently, a 
circumstance made me acquainted with 
a gentleman from England who is lec- 
turing at the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons in San Francisco, and is of 
no small note in Germany and Eng. 
land, from whose schools he graduated, 
and where he taught for some years. 
He said to me: "I am not an Ameri- 
can, Mr. Robinson, but I have viewed 
with considerable interest, as a scholar, 
the work of your people and the prob- 
lems they are working out, and I feel 
as an anthropologist, as a student of 
social conditions, deep interest in the 
social problem that your people have 
raised, and we shall note its progress, 
and I feel that you should have been 
left alone to solve it. Conditions are 
such," said he "that we do not know 
what confronts us as an Anglo-Saxon 
people. Look about you in this state 
and you will find that the people here 
have a problem in hand, and it is this: 
Will the native son of the Golden AVost 
live to be a great grandfather or not? 
While the peoples from southern Eu- 
rope, and some from northern Europe, 
are flourishing and growing numerous 
in the warmer districts of California, 
the native son, the Anglo-Saxon, is be- 
ing crowded out." He attributed this 
to the effect, not of the climate, so tar 
as heat is concerned, but that it was 
so much sunshine that was detrimen- 
tal' to the Anglo-Saxon and the Teu- 
tonic races, and that they flourished 
best in the north. "Because of this," 
said he, "we will view with considera- 
ble interest and attention the progress 
of your Mexican colonies." He wanted 
to know if I was conversant with con- 
ditions there and whether there were 
great-grandchildren to be found among 
that people. 

I might go on and cite others of the 
honorable of the earth, who have talk- 
ed to me. One of them, an eminent sur- 
geon, who is going to lecture for three 
months in England, by invitation of 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



37 



one of the scientific societies of the 
land, has been one of our best friends 
and supporters. When any accident or 
serious illness has occurred to members 
of our Church in the immediate neigh- 
borhood of San Francisco, or when any 
of the Elders have developed organic 
trouble that could not be overcome by 
mild nursing or friendly physicians, 
whenever it was evident that a special- 
ist's attention was required, we, have 
gone to this man's hospital and he has 
treated our brethren free of charge. 
He has written to me that if there is 
anything he can do for our people, 
w in ether they have any money or not, 
we can command his services, tind Lhe 
services of his hospital. 

I think it is good to know that all 
men do not hold us in contempt, but 
that those who are liberal minded, 
those who are watching the progress 
of events, recognize in the Gospel we 
teach an uplifting and saving force; 
that there is something in it that does 
not come from man's wisdom, but from 
the Spirit of our Father who is in Heav- 
en. In various ways these friends of 
ours acknowledge this by their testimo- 
nies and their actions toward us. 
One of the pension examining board 
of the state, who is a physician, told 
me that he had seen a coterie of Elders 
upon the streets of the capital city at 
various times speaking in public, but 
did not know who they were; but he 
said that he never went by them with- 
out feeling that he would like to take 
them in his arms and bless them, be- 
cause of the cleanliness of their lives, 
which was exemplified in their dress 
and could be read in their counte- 
nances. After he became acquainted 
with us he made his office a rendez- 
vous for our Elders, and has treated 
them for any ailment without charg- 
ing anything at all for his services. 

In this connection I would like to 
say kindly, to the Bishops and Presi- 
dents of stakes, that I do not want you 
to think California Is a cure-all for all 
kinds of disease. Out of 30 elders we 
have had during the past year nearly 50 
Per cent of them have been ill when 
they came .there, with lung trouble. 



threat trouble, or heart trouble; for 
that reason the efforts and labors of 
some of the able-bodied men have been 
^embarrassed. Only last week a brothei 
came to the mission and said: "I guess 
you know I was called to the Northern 
States." No, I said, I do not know. 
"Well," he said, "I was, but they 
thought I had better come here for my 
health." Three weeks before, another 
man came for hi s health because he 
had rheumatics, and they thought it 
would be better for him to go to Cali- 
fornia. On this account our labors have 
been handicapped more or less. Not- 
withstanding this, however, we have 
had better success in baptisms, and in 
meeting people in their homes and in 
public halls, than we have had for 18 
or 10 months past. We have had the 
privilege of baptizing some very good 
men and women this spring; and I have 
been surprised at the knowledge they 
have displayed of the laws of the Gos- 
pel. One man said to me: "Now, 
Brother Robinson, I want to enjoy all 
the. gifts of the Church and I want to 
pay my tithes." I knew he did not 
work and I said to him, "You are not 
laboring now, are you?" He said, "No, 
but I have saved a little, and I want to 
pay tithes on my surplus, for so reads 
the Word of the Lord." I blessed him 
for his faith and he paid tithing on his 
surplus. One of our sisters who had 
been converted also paid tithing on her 
surplus. She was a young girl just 
baptized into the Church, but in this 
way s he showed her faith in the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. I feel that 
though the converts may be few, when 
they evidence such faith as this it is 
worth all the effort we put forth. Some 
feel that it is uphill work to hold meet- 
ing? on the streets. On one of the fa- 
vored streets of San Francisco— Grant 
Avenue— you will find in one short 
block nearly every evening in the week 
from ten to fifteen different meetings 
being held, orthodox and unorthodox, 
infidel, socialist, Citizens' Alliance, Sal- 
vation Army, Volunteers of America, 
the Penial Mission, and independent 
lecturers, colored and white, and among 
the rest you will find the "Mormon"

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Elders. We usually hold two corners. 
Some of my brethren who visited there 
•said to me: "Brother Robinson, this 
looks like hawking the Gospel on the" 
street corner; it seems to mfe you 
might just as well talk against the 
w'nd." Well, every once in a while 
some one will come up, grasp us by 
the hand, and say, "That is just the 
kind of talk I want; it is what I have 
been looking for." One man told us 
that three weeks before, he had hearu. 
us on the streets and had come to om 
meetings, and, said he, "you will par- 
don me, Elder Robinson, but I cannot 
keep away from you; you teach just 
what I want." So I feel that we are 
blessed if only occasionally on e shall 
come to us with this testimony, and 
then become indentified with the Church 
I w ant to say for the Pioneer Society 
of San Bernardino (that old town which 
was founded by our brethren and sis- 
ters in early days,) their hearts as 
they grow older, reach out to the peo- 
pleple of Utah. For some years we have 
gone to their meetings, we have sung 
for them, we have prayed for them, w e 
have helped them bury their dead; 
and last fall we organized for 
them an old folks' day, the first 
of the kind in that state. It seemed 
to find favor with all the citizens. Vari- 
ous church members came to us, prin- 
cipally of the Ladies' Aid society,and 
assisted to care for the old people upon 
the day set apart for the holiday, and 
they pledged themselves to support us 
in that manner, until the enmity of 
some of the churches was aroused, and 
they forbade their members to have 
ought to do with us. This has resulted 
in some leaving the church they be- 
longed to, and they are helping us in 
that city. Among other things, they 
propose to visit Salt Lake City this 
summer, through the kindness of Sen- 
ator Clark. As early as the 17th of last 
July they passed a motion inviting me 
as their honored guest, to join them 
when they should visit Salt Lake City, 
and to be with them here, not because 
of my own individuality, but because I 
was the representative of our people. 1 
had the privilege today of handing to 



Elder Ben E. Rich a little souvenir 
from the society, in the shape of a 
badge of membership, presented to him 
because of the love that they bore his 
father. As they grow older their love 
for the founders of u-.ai city increases, 
and they hold them in high honor and 
esteem. Many of them, although they 
have lost their identity with the 
Church, and possibly so long as they 
live will not recognize themselves ot 
permit us to recognize them as mem- 
bers, yet I have noted that when the 
"dread summons" comes to carry them 
hence, they want us to be with them, 
and have asked that we should preach 
their funeral discourses. In many in- 
stances they have even acknowledged 
that the Gospel is true, and that it has 
been through their own weakness that 
they have fallen away and lost their 
membership. 

The young Elders in that mission ;>re 
humble, faithful, and painstaking in 
their efforts. They go not forth in then- 
own strength, but like David, when he 
faced Goliath, they go in the strength 
and the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
The courage which they evidence, and 
the faith they manifest, works upon 
the hearts of the people to receive their 
testimonies, and" it makes friends of 
them whether they embrace the Gospel 
or not. This encourages us. 

We feel to sustain the Church organ- 
ization. We have learned by experi- 
ence that we do not walk in our own 
light. Sometimes we borrow light from 
others, but we are trying to live so 
that we shall walk by faith, by the 
light that shines from within, that we 
may be enabled to follow our file lead- 
ers in all things: in this we know there 
is safety. God grant that we may re- 
alize all our fond ideals and aspira- 
tions, and that it shall not be long be- 
fore the world shall believe that the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is for 
the uplifting of humanity, for the sal- 
vation of the souls of men, for the 
healing of the nations, and that we are 
the ambassadors of truth and right- 
eousness, I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission. 

My Brethren and Sisters: I am 
happy to have the privilege of attend- 
ing this conference. I have enjoyed 
the good spirit that has prevailed and 
the reports that have been given, and I 
pray that God will bless me the few 
minutes I stand before you to report 
the condition of the Northern States 
mission. I am proud to have the 
privilege of laboring in the ministry 
with so many good brethren who have 
heen called to preach the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. In the last seven weeks 
I have met with the seven conferences 
of the Northern States mission, and I 
have been led to think that our Elders 
are like some of the young men of the 
Scriptures, very youthful; but I can 
hear witness that God has been with 
them in their ministry, and magnified 
them before the people, and the honest 
in heart have been made to rejoice. 
Some who left you as boys have been 
moved upon by the Spirit of God to 
such a degree that their wisdom has 
made them mighty servants of the 
Lord. In listening to the little children 
sing this afternoon I was led to re- 
member the time when Joseph Smith, 
as a boy, stood in the presence of our 
Father and His Son Jesus Christ. I 
thought of the Elders who have had 
the Spirit of the Lord poured out upon 
them in great power, and though their 
hearts are not moved to the same ex- 
tent as was the Prophet Joseph's, yet 
they have been led to praise God for 
the degree of His Spirit that has rest- 
ed upon them. I have contemplated 
much of late how Jloseph Smith in 
his youthfulness must have been im- 
pressed by standing in the presence of 
the Father and the Son, and, after the 
lapse of three and one-half years, by 
the wonderful lessons he received from 
the Angel of God. He was then left 
again for a time, and later received 
wonderful lessons from on high, until, 
when he arrived at maturity, he was 
prepared to be an instrument in the 
hands of God. Through him our Fath- 
er restored the Gospel of Jesus Christ 



— a Gospel of work, a Gospel which 
should prepare the earth for the com- 
ing of our Lord and Master to reign 
thereon among His children. He never 
taught a Gospel of idleness. He taught 
the Latter-day Saints that they must 
be industrious. 

In our ministry throughout the 
states of Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, 
the Latter-day Saints are well known 
for their labors, their integrity, their 
faithfulness, their fidelity to God, and 
their fellow men. I am proud to have 
the privilege of being a member ifr 
the Church of Jesus Christ. It is a. 
Church that teaches men, women and 
children to work to prepare them- 
selves to enjoy the presence of our 
Father and His Son Jesus Christ, as' 
well as associate with those men who 
have lived before us who, by their 
faith and good works, were prepared 
to enjoy the salvation which comes by 
the grace of God. 

The conditions of the Northern States 
mission we think were never brighter. 
Last October we reported to you a con- 
ference just held in Nauvoo, and, while 
we have not baptized any more people 
there, we have established a Sunday 
school, and I believe the average at- 
tendance has been 40. Our services 
are attended by from 100 to 300 peo- 
ple. They say their city is 60 years 
behind itself* - and they welcome us 
back because our people do things. 
One man told me that it seems as 
though the ground in and around 
Nauvoo had been cursed, and that it 
would never amount to anything until 
the Latter-day Saints came back. 
We announced our desire to hold meet- 
ings there permanently, and the peo- 
ple helped us to obtain a suitable 
place for that purpose. We secured a 
corner lot on the block that President 
John Taylor used to live upon. The 
place was used for a store, but it has 
been fitted up as a meeting room, and 
one year's rent paid in advance by 
the people, because they desire us to 
continue preaching among them. The 
best people of the town are found in 
our congregations listening to the 
voices of the humble Elders who are 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sent to preach unto them. Our con- 
certs and other amusements that we 
have given there have been well oat- 
ronized. 

One year ago last winter our Elders 
were turned out at 11 o'clock at night 
from a public hotel in Zion City. Be- 
fore then they had lived in a dozen 
homes there, but the edict went forth 
from "Elijah" Dowie, and they were 
turned out from the hotel and left the 
■city, with snow about eight inches 
■deep, and had to walk a number of 
miles to another town. But within the 
last few months our Elders have found 
much to do in and around Zion City. 
The people there have been taught that 
an Angel would come, and that a 
church would be established upon the 
earth with Apostles, Seventies, Elders. 
Priests, teachers, and Deacons, as they 
were originally in the church of Christ, 
and they have been looking for these 
to be appointed by the man whom they 
have thought to be Elijah II. The 
Elders are now declaring to them the 
Gospel message, and while we have 
not baptized any yet, numbers of the. 
people welcome us to their homes, and 
we believe our Elders will have the 
privilege of baptizing some of them. 

In the city of Council Bluffs, where 
about three years ago the Elders were 
taken away after we had vainly tried 
for years to , maintain a branch of the 
Church, the Elders are now laboring 
again, with good success. Since 
Christmas, we have baptized about a 
dozen, and there are more good honest 
souls prepared to accept the truth. 
We feel much encouraged in that city, 
as we are in other cities. We are 
thankful for the number of Elders who 
are being sent to that mission. The 
field is large, and many people are 
hunting for the truth; and they are be- 
ginning to think that it is wrong for 
congregations to pay ministers to 
study the word of God for them, in- 
stead of individuals drawing near to 
the Lord tnemselves. 

Our students in Chicago are a great 
help to the Elders there. We have 
taken most of the Elders out of Chica- 
go and left the preaching to be done by 



our students. They are a faithful lot, 
almost to a man. They are found, in 
church at least once each Sunday, at 
Sunday school or Sacrament meeting 
showing considerable faith when you 
consider that they have gone there to 
gain an education along other lines. 
We are proud of our students, and the 
universities are proud of them. This 
year the University of Wisconsin and 
the University of Chicago were repre- 
sented by two of our students in the 
Inter-state debate. 

My brethren and sisters. I am thank- 
ful for the privilege of bearing my tes- 
timony and reporting the condition of 
that mission. Some of the honest in 
heart are prepared to receive the truth. 
We have about all we can do minister- 
ing to those who desire to be taught 
the Gospel, and to be led in the 
straight and narrow way. I pray our 
Heavenly Father that His blessings 
will be upon the Elders there, and 
upon the honest in heart, also. We 
pray that our Father in heaven will 
help us to realize the great responsi- 
bility that rests upon us, that we will 
feel in part what the Prophet Joseph 
did after he received his great les- 
sons from our Father in Heaven, and 
the holy angels that he had the priv- 
ilege of being taught by. We pray 
that God will bless the leaders of Zion 
today, and the people also, that they 
may follow in the footsteps of Jesus. 
We pray for these blessings in the 
name of Jesus our Redeemer, Amen. 

The children's choir sang, "One 
hundred years." 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters: I feel very 
grateful indeed for the blessings I am 
enjoying in attending this great con- 
ference of the Church of Christ. I am 
thankful that I can report to you that 
the mission where I am laboring i s in 
a most excellent condition, and that 
your sons who have been sent there by 
the authority of the Lord are in good

.condition spiritually and physically foi 
their work. They travel largely in the 
•country districts; at the same time 
many of them labor in the cities. Pour 
■of the great commercial cities of our 
•country are located in that section 
•embraced within the Central States 
Mission. The elders travel principally 
two by two; but when circumstances 
demand they go singly. They 'work in 
the cities and in the country districts; 
they sleep in all kinds of places; they 
visi: all classes of people; and yet out 
of more than five hunded elders who- 
have labored in that mission since I 
have been there, not one of them, so 
far as my knowledge goes, has re- 
turned home unclean, as a result of 
anything he has done while laboring 
In the mission field. I have felt thai 
that was a remarkable record for up- 
wards of five hundred young men who 
have gone into the world inexperienced, 
an:l many of whom have scarcely been 
away from their homes before. During 
the past year our elders have visited, 
fir each elder, one thousand families, 
of those who are strangers to the Gos- 
pel .as revealed through the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, and inasmuch as they tra- 
vel generally two by two, that would 
make two thousand families to each 
pair of elders. In Louisiana the elders 
were quarantined during a large part of 
the year because of an outbreak of the 
yellow fever in the city of New Orleans. 
Notwithstanding this, our baptisms foi 
1903 were in in excess of the year pre- 
vious. The work of the Lord is grow- 
ing in that part of the land. But there 
is a large part of the population that 
we are unable to reach because we havt 
no elders in the field who can speak 
the language of the people I refer t«*. 
Tho Lord has brought to this country 
ni.'llions of people from other nations 
of the earth, and from th e Germanic 
states of Europe thousands have come 
ttho are among the best people of that 
section of the country in which we are 
laboring. In several states of our mis- 
sion there are whole counties the popu- 
lation of which is nearly altogether 
German. They speak but very little 
English, and we have not an elder in 



the mission who can visit them and 
teach them the Gospel. I say the Lord 
has brought these people to this land. 
He has brought them to our doors; they 
are a superior clas s of people; they art. 
industrious, thrifty, and hospitable, 
and our elders could go among them 
without purse or scrip, according to tht 
plan the Lord has revealed, and teach 
them the Gospel and receive their hos- 
pitality. We are satisfied that thou- 
sands of them would rejoice in the mes- 
sage that cur elders would bear to 
them. Some of them who have learned 
to speak the English language a little 
have received the Gospel and art. 
among the very best of our members. 

Sometime ago one of our elders was. 
taken by a body of men out into the 
woods, tied to a tree, and whipped. This 
is a very exceptional case in our mis- 
sion. As soon as this fact was reported 
to me, I wrote to the Governor of the 
State where the whipping occurred (the 
State of Arkansas), and called his at- 
tention to the outrage that had been 
done upon this young man. I asked 
him. as the executive of that state, if 
he- would not see to it that protect i or, 
was given to our elders, and that the 
wrongs that this citizen of the United 
States had suffered should be redress vt. 
He wrote me a very kind and court 30'is 
letter, stating that it was the first t:me 
during his administration that he had 
heard of anything of the kind in Ms 
state, and he promised to send the na- 
pe's fend an account of the outrage to 
th.? persecuting attorney and judge of 
the district where it took place, and see 
that steps were taken to bring the guil- 
ty uarlies to justice. 

A short time after I received a letter 
from th* judge of the Fifth judicial dis- 
trict of the State of Arkansas, and it 
road something like this: "Pres. 7. G. 
Duftin, Kansas City, Mo. Dear Sir: Pa- 
Tjerd hav<? been placed in my hands 
from the governor of the state, giving 
riie information that an outrage has 
be.m committed upon the holy of one 
of the eMers of the Church of Jesus 
Christ ol Latter-day Saints. I reg.-st 
exceedingly to learn that such a thing 
has been don e in this state. I have

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



hrard thai such things have oeen done, 
that your elders have been mistreated 
in veal's past, and that the guilty par- 
ties have gone unwhipped of justice; 
but in this case, if it is possible that I 
can do anything to bring these guilty 
parties to justicej can assure you that 
they will not escape." He goes on to 
say that, about the time the elder was 
receiving this treatment in his dis- 
trict, his sick wife was in the State 
of Utah for her health, and she was be- 
ing cared for by a family of our people, 
and receiving the kindest of treatment 
at their hands. I thought, my brethren 
and sisters when this letter came to 
me, what an example it was to us of 
the treatment that we should give 
the stranger within our gates, and after 
many days the bread that is cast upon 
the water will return to us with a 
blessing, not only unto our people, but 
unto our sons who are proclaiming the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The 
work of the Lord is increasing in that 
land. The faith of your boys is grow- 
ing. They plant their feet firmly upon 
the revelations of God. They are not 
ashamed of the Gospel, neither are 
they ashamed of the name they bear, 
nor of their parentage, nor of their 
people. They face the world with tin. 
glorious message of revealed truth that 
they have to bear, and they are loyal 
and true in defense of that truth, up- 
holding before the people the man of 
God whom our Father has placed at the 
head of His work upon this earth. The 
man to whom He has given the keys 
of the priesthood has their loyal sup- 
port, confidence, and love, and this 
work has their loyal support and love 
also. With the help of our Father in 
Heaven, so long as we are in that land 
laboring among our young brethren, it 
is our desire that when your sons re- 
turn to their homes they will have it to 
say that their brethren who presided 
over them, in every act of their lives, 
in every word of instruction, advice, 
or counsel, sought to instill into their 
hearts the principle of faith in this 
great work that God has established 
upon the earth, nevermore to be taken 
therefrom, nor to be given to another 



peopie. May the blessings of heaven 
be with you and His Spirit continue 
with us in this conference. I ask 
these blessings in the name of Jesus, 
our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 

(President of Southern States Mission.)" 

The territory covered by the Southern 
States mission is quite large, and in- 
cludes the states of Ohio, Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Georgie, Florida, Alabama, Mississip- 
pi, Tennessee, and Kentucky. We have 
had a large number of Elders labor- 
ing in that district. Recently it has 
been my privilege to investigate the- 
conditions in some of the islands of 
the sea. I have visited the Bahama 
Islands. We have Elders laboring- on 
the Island of Key West, and I have had 
the privilege of bearing my testimony 
also upon the Island of Cuha. During 
the few years I have labored in the 
South, I think fourteen hundred Elders 
have labored at various times under 
my direction. I believe I can count 
upon the fingers of one hand the num- 
ber of Elders who have made ship- 
wreck of their missions and been sent 
home with a dishonorable release. Re- 
cently we had the presidents of all our 
conferences together, and, after culling 
out from the records of the various 
conferences the names of Saints whom 
we had lost sight of, and those whose 
standing in the Church was questioned, 
our reports showed that we had almost 
ten thousand members of the Church 
in the Southern States mission. 

We have had considerable trouble on 
a little island by the name of Harker's 
Island, in North Carolina. Our Elders 
erected a church there, the Saints hav- 
ing purchased the lumber and floated 
it over to the island, and the Elders 
doing the carpenter work. It was one 
of the nicest churches on the island. 
But the enemy burned it down, soon 
after the visit of one of the ministers, 
who was very much opposed to us, and 
who recommended the people to take 
any step to rid themselves of the "Mor- 
mon" religion. One of our Elders had: 



ELDER BEN. E. RICH. 



43 



started a school there by request, there 
being no school upon the island, and 
this seemed to enrage the people, with 
the result as stated. The school was 
continued in a private house, and' they 
were informed by a note tacked upon 
the door that the house would be 
burned if the school was continued. One 
of the merchants received a notice that 
his store would be burned unless he 
discharged a "Mormon" girl employed 
there. They thought they would con- 
tinue the Sunday school in the open air, 
and now they have received word that 
they must not do that, or else they 
will burn the houses of all the Saints 
if they continue it. (President Smith 
asks me if we had received notice that 
they would burn the air.) 1 wrote to 
the Governor of North Carolina, and in 
answer he stated that his people did 
not like our faith, but he would see 
what could be done towards protecting 
us. I told him, in my reply to his an- 
swer, that the people did not like the 
faith of Christ Jesus, and for that rea- 
son they crucified Him. I said that 
some of my people at home did not 
like his faith, but his co-religionists 
were permitted to worship God accord- 
ing to the dictates of their consciences. 
I reminded him also that there were 
1,425 of the people of his state who did 
like my faith and belonged to it, and 
we asked him to protect them in the 
rights guaranteed unto them under, the 
Constitution of the United States. He 
has sent the papers to the attorney- 
general, and I believe that we are going 
to get justice. We do not occupy the 
same position that the Irishman did 
when he was told by the judge that 
justice should be done to him, and he 
stated that that was what he was 
afraid of. (Laughter.) 

As a rule Ave receive more protec- 
tion in the Southern States now than 
we have had before, and we have been 
building more churches. In the City 
of Jacksonville, we have just com- 
pleted a church at a cost of $2,500. All 
the carpenter work has been performed 
by the Elders. It is nicely seated, and 
everything bids fair for the building 
up of a most excellent branch in that 



part of the mission. I believe that 
our Elders and Saints are united, but, 
as I have stated many times, we have 
not the number of missionaries that we 
ought to have. 

I was interested in the remarks made 
by some of the First Seven Presidents 
of the Seventies concerning the mis- 
sion of the Seventies. Their mission 
is in the world. They are the ecclesi- 
astical lawyers, to argue the cause of" 
God's plan of salvation before the jury 
of the world. "Whenever one of these 
Seventies is selected, I do not think it 
is right for the High Priests to object 
to his going upon a mission because 
he is needed at home. You should 
receive more of your help at home from 
among the High Priests. That is their 
business. You remember the "Mormon" 
creed as laid down by Brigham Young, 
"Let every man mind his own busi- 
ness." It is the High Priests' business 
to preside and work at home. It is 
the Seventies' business to go into the 
world and preach the Gospel; and when 
they are called, let them go. 

I rejoice in having the privilege of 
coming here to worship. In preaching 
the Gospel in the world we bear testi- 
mony to the divine mission of the men 
who stand at the head of this work, 
and what I said to the young people a 
few nights ago in one of the wards 
I would like to say to you. It is our 
duty to respect these men, to honor and 
sustain them, and to remember the 
word of God which has come down 
to us through the ages, that He doeth 
nothing save He revealeth His secrets 
to His servants the Prophets; and, 
where there are no visions the people 
will perish. If we will examine holy 
writ we will learn the respect that God 
has for those designated as prophets 
upon the earth, and also the respect 
that He commands His angels in 
Heaven to pay to His prophets on the 
earth. You read the tenth chapter 
of the Acts of the Apostles, and there- 
you will find an account of as good a 
man as lived praying to God for in- 
formation, and he had so much power 
and influence with the Lord that his 
prayers came up as a memorial, and 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God sent a holy angel in response to 
his petition. When the angel came 
and Cornelius asked for information 
concerning what he should do in order 
"to be saved, the angel understood the 
law of Heaven concerning God's proph- 
ets upon the earth. He could have 
answered Cornelius' question himself, 
but he knew that God worked through 
His servants upon the earth, and the 
angel told Cornelius where he could 
find Peter, and God prepared Peter 
for the coming of the servants of 
that good man. 

This should teach us the lesson that 
God works through prophets on the 
earth, and honors them in their place, 
that his angels honor them, and that 
we should honor them and stand by 
them, and not always be looking for 
faults. The Gospel makes every man 
free and independent. It makes me as 
free and independent in the sphere in 
which I live as God is free in the sphere 
in which He lives. He has given us all 
our free agency. Even the prophets of 
God have their free agency, and must 
be left to themselves at times to act 
upon that free agency. If it were not 
so their agency would be nullified. 
There is another case in holy writ 

-where Saul, who persecuted the Saints, 
while on his road to Damascus was 
stricken blind, and he heard a voice 
saying unto him, "Why persecutest 
thou me?" "Who art thou, Lord?" 'I 
am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou per- 
secutest." What must have been the 
feelings of Saul upon that occasion? He 
immediately wanted to know what he 
should do. Now, there was Jesus talk- 
ing to him. Christ knew what he 
should do, but even He had respect to 
His servants and prophets, and knew 
that it was a law of heaven that Goc' 

\ worked through them on the earth, an 3, 



so He told Saul to go to Damascus and 
there it would be told him what he 
should do. Then one of the servants 
of the Lord who had the testimony of 
Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy 
received a revelation to go to Saul and 
tell him what he should do. 

These are lessons for you and me, my 
brethren and sisters; and let us take 
the mote out of our own eye before 
looking for faults in others. It re- 
minds me of what I heard Josh Billings 
once say. He said a friend of his ask- 
ed him if he had ever heard Ingersoll 
on the mistakes of Moses, and he le- 
plied, "No, I have not; but I would 
give S50C any day to hear Moses on the 
mistakes of Ingersoll." When you feel 
like criticising the authorities of the 
Church, stand before the mirror and 
examine yourself. A friend of mine 
asked me the other day why we did 
not receive more revelations from God. 
I took the Book of Mormon, and said, 
'Here is one; have you read it?" He 
acknowledged he had not. "Here is 
the Doctrine and Covenants; have you 
read that?" No, he had not. "Here is 
the Pearl of Great Price; have you 
read that?" He acknowledged that he 
had not read it all. "Well,' 'said I, 
"If I was the Almighty I would not 
say another word to you until you 
made yourself acquainted with what I 
had already said.' 

' God bless you in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The children sang, "A Lullaby 
Song," and the national song, "Amer- 
ica," was sung by the children and the 
congregation. 

Benediction by Elder Joseph A. Mc- 
Rae. 

Conference adjourned till Sunday 
morning at 10 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, April 8, 10 a. m. 

Conference called to order by Prest. 
Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir sang the anthem, "From 
afar, Gracious Lord, thou hast gath- 
ered thy flock." 

Prayer was offered by Elder An- 
drew Kimball. 

The Tabernacle was excessively 
crowded, and it was announced that 
an overflow meeting would be held in 
the Assembly Hall. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Rouse, 

ye Mortals." 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

(President of Juarez Stake.) 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, 
first to express the personal gratituds 

1 feel towards my Heavenly Father 
this morning, that I am worthy to be 
accounted a member of the Church of 
Christ, and that it is my privilege, in 
connection with you, to come up here 
to the house of the Lord upon this 
occasion, where we may be taught of 
His ways and learn to walk in His 
paths. I want to bear my testimony 
to the strong conviction I have felt 
since this conference convened that the 
promises made by the Lord, and which 
apply directly to the Church of Christ 
restored to the earth and fully estab- 
lished in the dispensation in which we 
live, are being verified, and that those 
promises which have not yet been ful- 
filled will all be accomplished in time, 
and in the way our Father in Heaven 
designs. The conviction I have felt is 
that no power which may be brought 
to bear against the Church from with- 
out, nor any dissension that may occur 
within, will ever, from this time forth, 
retard the progress or development of 
the work of God. I believe this because 
the Lord has said it. I believe it be- 
cause I know that the principles of the 



Gospel are founded upon everlasting, 
truth, and I know that whatever effort 
may be made to overthrow it, eventual- 
ly the truth must and will prevail, the 
Latter-day Saints will be vindicated,, 
and the mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith will be acknowledged by the- 
world. 

I feel exceedingly grateful that it 
has been possible for a large number of 
people to come to this conference from 
Mexico, traveling 2,200 miles to get here. 
There are more than 30 representatives 
here, who, by the time they have re- 
turned to their homes, will have spent 
at least $6,000 in order to attend this 
conference. 

Mexico is a peculiar country. It is 
a country of great extremes— of in- 
tense sunshine and terrific showers, of 
vast unproductive plains and of val- 
leys which are among the most produc- 
tive in the world, with great, ranges of 
treeless mountains, and plains that are 
covered with forests of most beautiful 
timber. It is not strange that the race 
of people who have inhabited that coun- 
try for hundreds of years have partak- 
en more or less of its characteristics. 
So the Mexican people are a people of 
extremes, a peculiar people, different, 
perhaps, to any other in the world. 

During the past six months we have- 
passed through some very trying cir- 
cumstances in the Juarez Stake of 
Zion. Some of our colonies have been 
almost destroyed by flood, and great 
damage has been done. Many of the- 
people have lost the accumulations of a 
lifetime. Notwithstanding that whiclt 
the people have suffered they are not 
discouraged, but "come up smiling," 
determined to grapple with nature and 
regain that which has been lost. There 
are 3,871 Latter-day Saints in Mexico, 
according to the last statistics we took. 
These people are scattered over a large 
area of country. They are a poor peo- 
ple, but, notwithstanding this (fact, 



46 GENERAL < 

tthese 3,800 individuals paid in 1905, 
$54,100 in tithing, or $13.99 for each soul 
in the stake. Mexican money, some- 
one suggests. Yes, that would be in 
Mexican silver, and would only have .> 
face value in the United States of 50 
cents on the dollar. But it costs us just 
as much to get a Mexican dollar as :t 
does you to get a dollar in the United 
States. Our mechanics, our laboring 
men, our school teachers, our store 
clerks, receive no more in Mexican 
money for their month's work than you 
do here in gold. 

Our relationship with the Mexican 
government is of the most harmonious 
character. Recently, at an official 
■opening of our Stake Academy, 
which, by the blessing of the Lord and 
the assistance Ave have received from 
our brethren, Ave have been able to 
establish, a large number of repre- 
sentatives of the Mexican government 
were present. In fact, it was their of- 
ficial opening of our school, and they 
participated with us, and encouraged 
us to a degree that Ave could hardly 
have expected in the Avork of educa- 
tion which we are doing in that coun- 
try. We have found that these exam- 
ples of ours in industry, and in estab- 
lishing good schools wherein lessons 
are given not only to our oavii children 
but to theirs also, have done more to 
establish friendly relations, and 'to 
gain their confidence, than anything 
else that we probably could have done. 
A large number of their children are 
in attendance at these schools. Just 
before I left home tAvo representative 
men visited Colonia Juarez and went 
in to the manual training department 
of our school, Avhere they found five 
or six of their oavii boys, Avith their 
coats off, at work on the machines. 
They were overcome Avith emotion, 
because they said it Avas something 
they had never been able to get them 
to do at home. The boys themselves 
were enthusiastic in their work and 
studies. 

The mission which has been estab- 
lished in the neighborhood of the City 
of Mexico, and Which is under the 
presidency of Hyrum S. Harris, is 



NFERENCB. 

progressing very favorably; in fact, it 
appears to us that our effort should 
be to rather retard its development a 
little, until we are better prepared to 
take care of the people, than to en- 
courage and push it. There is a vast 
field for missionary effort in Mexico, 
and undoubtedly a greater one in Gen- 
eral America and South America. My 
brethren and sisters, Avhile you are 
teaching French, German and Latin in 
your schools, do not forget that there 
is something for the Latter-day Saints 
to do among the Spanish-speaking 
people of the world. There are about 
30,0 00,000 Indians doAvn south of us 
who speak the Spanish language — peo- 
ple Avhose forefathers gave us the 
Book of Mormon. In Cuba, in Porto 
Rico, and in Spain itself, there are 
many millions of people yet to hear 
the Gospel in the Spanish language, so 
that if you teach your sons Spanish 
you may be of assistance to us in the 
development of our missionary work in 
Mexico. It is a pleasure to me to bear 
witness to the integrity, faith, and de- 
A'otion of your brethren arid sisters 
who are in that dista,nt land. It is a 
pleasure to me to tell you that they 
have implicit faith in the promises 
Avhich have been made by the Lord 
to the native people Avho live in that 
country. We believe that the day is 
come for them to be brought back to a 
knowledge of the faith of their fathers, 
and converted to the truths of the 
Gospel, that they may become an ac- 
tive force and factor in the develop- 
ment of the Lord's AA r ork. 

My brethren and sisters, Ave are en- 
gaged in the Lord's Avork. This is 
His Church, and He will magnify it- 
He will magnify us also if Ave are 
faithful. He will reAvard us for our 
righteous Avorks. If AA r e will accomplish 
the part assigned to us there can be 
no doubt that the Lord will accomplish 
that Avhich He has promised. But He 
is not going to do it alone; He is going 
to do it with labors of men and women. 
We live in an age when He has prom- 
ised, as He never did before in any 
other Gospel dispensation, that the 
faith of the people Avould be sufficient

to maintain the work of the Lord. He 
has declared that it is established for 
the last time, to triumph and to pre- 
vail. This is a very reasonable thing 
.since the Gospel has never been on the 
earth before in a dispensation, when 
reason, argument and intelligence ex- 
isted to such an extent in the earth, 
and when there was the same oppor- 
tunity for it to prevail as there is in 
this dispensation of the fullness of 
times. M 

I bear testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, to the good that has come to 
me through obedience to the principles 
of the Gospel. I feel under great ob- 
ligations to my Heavenly Father, and 
it seems to me that He has more than 
repaid me for every act of my life 
which has been devoted to His cause, 
in the blessings that have come to me 
personally, in testimonies, and in 
strength that I have received in times 
of adversity and trouble. I bear wit- 
ness to the influence for good which has 
•come to me through association with 
the servants of the Lord. It was my 
good fortune to be personally acquaint- 
ed with President Young. I sat at his 
table when a boy, and I feel to this 
day the influence upon my character 
which was made by the presence and 
the words of that man. I knew Pres- 
ident John Taylor personally, but not 
so intimately, and the same impres- 
sions came to me through my associa- 
tion with him. I knew President Wood- 
ruff better than any other man who has 
presided over the Church. He lived in 
my neighborhood, I traveled with him, 
and I bear testimony that I was 
strengthened and blessed, and my faith 
increased through my association with 
him. I can say the same regarding 
President Snow, and President Smith 
who now stands at the head of the 
Church. Our brethren who constitute 
the quorum of Apostles I have known, 
have traveled with them, slept with 
them, eaten with them, been with them 
in times when both mental and physical 
courage were necessary, and I have 
yet the first incident to recall where 
one of them has ever failed under these 
•circumstances. They are men of God, 



acting in the capacity to which they 
have been properly called, and He will 
magnify and uphold them; and through 
them, and through us, and, above all. 
by the blessings of the Lord, the truth 
will eventually triumph, and God's will 
be done on earth as it is in Heaven. 
May our faith be increased and 
strengthened that we may ad- 
here to the truth, is my desire and 
prayer through Jesus Chiist. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

The songs of Zion assist in religious train- 
ing.— immensity of the labor involved 
in proclaiming the Gospel. — Missionary 
success in lace of great opposition.— 
Only imaginary conversions result from 
revivals.— Many roads ao not lead to 
Heaven.— The narrow way to eternal life 
is wide enough for all. 

I have rejoiced in the testimonies that 
have been borne by the brethren wht. 
have spoken in the sessions of the con- 
ference which have already passed. I 
am very grateful for the words spoken 
at the opening of the conference by 
President Smith, in which he said that 
a period of prosperity, unity and 
growth characterized the Latter-day 
Saints during the last six months. I re- 
joice when I contemplate the great 
work that is being accomplished in 
the earth for the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men, for their temporal and 
spiritual salvation; for the gospel con- 
templates the saving of men both tem- 
porally and spiritually, the advancing 
of them to higher planes in mortality 
ana immortality. I am thankful for 
the work that is being done among tht- 
children of the Latter-day Saints. The 
tens of thousands of little ones, born 
under the covenant, are being instruct 
e-.l in the various organizations of the 
Church in the ways of the Lord. W(- 
had an illustration yesterday of some 
work which is being done among the 
children by Brother Stephens — a work 
that is grand indeed, and the full value 
of which is not, I suppose, entirely un- 
derstood. They are learning to sing the 
songs of Zion, and these song s breathe 
the spirit of the Gospel, and withir. 
them is contained the truth. The prin- 
ciples and doctrines of the Church are 



48 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



very often embodied in the hymns 
which are sung by both young- and old 
among the Latter-day Saints; and this, 
together with the instructions they re- 
ceive in the Religion Classes, the Prl- 
mary Associations, the Sabbath schools 
and the Mutual Improvement Associa- 
tions, will assist to develop them into 
men and women thoroughly indoctrin- 
ated in the principles of the Gospel, and 
make them familiar with the plan of 
life and salvation. They are on the 
way to making their calling and elec- 
tion sure. They are in that path which 
is narrow, and their faces are directed 
towards the straight gate which leads 
unto life eternal. The other organiza- 
tions among the adults or grown peo- 
ple likewise are doing a good work, ana 
we see in this congregation an evi- 
dence of great faith in the hearts of tht- 
people concerning the work of the Lord. 
Our missionaries are laboring earnestly 
and. as we have heard, most unselfish-, 
ly, that the people of the world may be 
taught the truth and be brought to 
a knowledge of the Gospel, that the> 
may know the truth, that they may 
know good from evil, that they may in- 
stantly determine right from wrong: 
and it is our prayer that the people 
may be so moved upon by the Spirit of 
the Lord that they will receive this 
word as it is carried to them by the 
Elders of the Church. Last year near- 
ly 2.400 men and women were added 
to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints by baptism. Now, at first 
sight that does not appear to be a very 
great work that ha s been performed b> 
the Elders; but that is really only a 
very small part of the work. They havt.- 
traversed tens of thousands of miles 
preaching the Gospel to the people in 
their cities, towns and villages. They 
have distributed among the people of 
the world millions of tracts explaining 
the plan of life and salvation. The>, 
have entered the homes of many thou- 
sands who, prior to their coming, had 
never heard about the restoration of the 
Gospel of Christ, or of the dispensation 
of the fulness of times; and unto thest- 
tens of thousands, aye, and hundreds of 
thousands of people, the Gospel has 



been preached, the message has been 1 
carried, and the doctrines and princi- 
ples of the Gospel have been explained, 
I presume millions of people in the last 
year have heard the Elders of the- 
Church as they have lifted their voice*, 
on the street and market places of tht, 
populated districts of the world. "This- 
gospel of the kingdom shall be preach- 
ed in all the world, for a witness be- 
fore the end shall come;" and this worn, 
is being done. We cannot help it if 
many will not accept the Gospel. We- 
acquit ourselves of the obligation and' 
the responsibility God has placed up- 
on us when we cry repentance unto 
the children of men. They then are- 
left to themselves, to obey or reject as 
they will, and they will receive the 
consequence of disobedience or re- 
wards of obedience to the word.- of 
divinity thus spoken. Nevertheless, 
2,400 intelligent men and women con- 
verted by these teachings, and baptized 
by immersion for the remission of 
their sins by authorized servants of 
God is, after all, under the circum- 
stances, a marvelous work. They 
have not been converted by methods 
of revivalism. I presume in the ma- 
jority of cases it has taken weeks and 
months, and perhaps years, to convert 
some of those who were baptized. 
Conversion from a condition of sin and 
unbelief to one of understanding and 
faith is not brought about instantane- 
ously. We" were told yesterday that 
upon hearing the Gospel some in- 
dividuals were convinced of its truth 
and immediately made application for 
baptism; but if these cases were ex- 
amined, we would find they compare 
very nearly with that instance of the 
conversion of Cornelius, also mention- 
ed yesterday. They are men and wo- 
men who have for some time, perhaps 
years, been dissatisfied with what the 
world offered them as the Gospel. 
They are people that have been seek- 
ing the truth, looking for light, who 
have been praying unto God for a 
knowledge of the truth, and thereby 
have prepared themselves for the mes- 
sage when they heard it, and are ready 
to rceive it immediately upon hearing

jt, and desire baptism. Usually we 
go among the people who are Chris- 
tians who do believe or profess to be- 
lieve, and that honestly, in God and in 
the saving and redeeming powers of 
the Lord Jesus Christ; and when we 
go among them, and they hear for the 
first time that they are after all prob- 
ably mistaken in the faith they have 
chosen, and in which they have been 
reared, it has a tremendous effect, it is 
a revolution, and it takes time, much 
time, for them to become convinced. 
It takes prayer, it takes instr;uctisji, 
and much labor on the part of the 
teachers of the Gospel to show these 
individuals that they have been in er- 
ror, and that their religious advisers 
have also been in error, and to con- 
vince them of the truth which is 
brought to them by the true shepherds 
of Jesus Christ. Consequently, the 
conversion of these people has re- 
quired much labor, and earnest, pray- 
erful work on the part of the servants 
of the Lord. When you come to think 
of it, 2,400 people are more than are 
contained in some towns and villages 
in the State of Utah or other states. 
Again, when you consider that these 
conversions have been made when the 
whole kingdom of the devil has been 
arrayed against the servants of God, it 
is all the more remarkable. When you 
consider that from thousands of pulpits 
throughout the civilized or Christian 
world so-called ministers of the Gos- 
pel have warned the people against 
the Elders of. the Church of Christ and 
also that the editors of influential 
newspapers throughout the whole 
country have filled the world, as it 
were, with falsehoods and lies, delug- 
ing the people with false ideas con- 
cerning the "Mormons," and warning 
all mankind to beware of the "Mor- 
mon" Elders, it is marvelous in our 
eyes. In spite of all this, in spite of 
regularly organized societies and 
leagues brought into existence for the 
purpose of fighting the Elders and 
putting stumbling blocks in their way, 
and biasing the minds of the - people, 
filling them with prejudice against the 
truth — it is a remarkable thing, my 



brethren and sisters, that the Elders 
have been able to reach the ears of 
intelligent men and women to the 
number of thousands who have been 
converted, and tens of thousands 
who are to a greater or less degree 
investigating the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. When you think too 
that governors of states and mayors of 
cities have joined the enemy and ban- 
ished the Elders from certain locali- 
ties; when ministers, as we heard yes- 
terday, have incited the populace to 
mob violence, whipping of the Elders, 
burning meeting houses, threatening 
those who even listen to them with the 
destruction of their homes and perhaps 
the sacrifice of their lives, the wonder 
increases. But it is God's work. The 
Elders are His servants. They are 
divinely called. They are also divine- 
ly clothed upon by the Holy Ghost. 
Though the whole nether world, with 
all the powers of hell and earth, shal^ 
oppose, they cannot prevail against 
God or His servants. It only requires 
a little thinking, a little prayer, a lit- 
tle charity, the exercise of a little com- 
mon sense on the part of intelligent 
men and women, just a moment's 
pause to consider carefully and 
thoughtfully the message brought to 
them, and the lives and conduct of the 
messengers who bring it, and compare 
these with the character and conduct 
of those who are fighting the work of 
God, to convince them of the truth. 

The Lord's work is going on. We 
read from time to time statistics from 
the various denominations of Christen- 
dom, giving the numbers of thousanas 
who have been converted to Christian- 
ity within certain periods; and if one- 
takes the trouble to investigate he 
may find that year after year the 
same thousands are converted over an.I 
over again and called converts to 
Christianity. The Christian world 
hold what they call revival meetings, 
.at which the people gather in largs 
numbers — the Christian people who 
have wandered away, who are given 
more or less to sin, and who have been 
only slightly interested in reiigion. 
Their time and attention have been oc- 
cupied in worldly pursuits. They hear

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men preach to them the Gospel, with 
great fervor and eloquence, and they 
are moved upon, they are touched, they 
see their sinful lives; and, either with 
the hope to escape the terrors of ever- 
lasting fire in hell, or to receive here- 
after the glorious and indolent rest of 
the "Christian" heaven, they are prone 
to repent for the time being, and are 
added to the church. A week after 
they are where they were before they 
were "converted," and it requires an- 
other revival meeting after awhile to 
again stir them up to repentance and 
faith. Not so with those who are con- 
verted to the Gospel of Christ. As I 
have said, the transition from wicked- 
ness and from worldly love to that of 
self-sacrifice, and faith in God. and 
obedience to the principles of the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ has never been ac- 
complished instantaneously. But these 
with whom we have labored long and 
diligently, have prepared themselves, 
and they are secure. They have a liv- 
ing faith, a faith accompanied with 
good works, and we can depend upon 
them— most of them, at least. There 
may be some even after all that ef- 
fort in their behalf who will fall away; 
that is sometimes the case. So like- 
wise, my brethren and sisters, the 
transition from obedience to truth, 
from a condition of faith in God, from 
good, virtuous, honorable, upright lives, 
to that of sin, apostasy and wicked- 
ness, is never instantaneous. No man 
who today is in full fellowship in the 
Church, who is receiving the approba- 
tion of God, and has the witness of the 
truth in his heart, who is keeping the 
commandments of the Lord, who is 
faithful, pure, virtuous and chaste, 
will tomorrow be cut off from the 
Church for adultery, for apostasy, or 
for wickedness and corruption. I have 
never known such a case; changes of 
this kind are brought about gradually, 
and take time. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, you 
are acquainted with the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus, you know the doctrines of 
the Church, you understand the 
principles of life and salva- 
tion, you know what the 



Lord has commanded us to do and not 
to do, therefore, we say unto you, fol- 
low this knowledge, and be guided by 
faith and prayer. Keep yourselves 
pure, and in the line of duty, in the 
straight and narrow way which leadeth 
to life eternal. Avoid that broad way 
and wide gate which leadeth to de- 
struction. It is all well and good, and 
I presume enticing to some, to listen 
to discourses on the forks of the road, 
and to be told to take either route you 
please, wander through the sweet 
scented woods and follow its meander- 
ings along the beautiful streams and 
pleasant meadows, and you will get 
to heaven after all in the end. That 
is all pretty enough to some, but to 
those who understand the truth it Is 
hideous, because it is not the fact; it 
is false, and not true. Well enough to 
talk about some of our winding and 
"meandering" country roads; but the 
man who sets his foot on the road 
that "meanders" towards London will 
have to right about face absolutely if 
he wishes to go to Carlisle or Glas- 
gow. There is but one way of life 
and salvation; and it is nonsen.se for 
men to take as text "I am the way, 
the truth, and the life," and then, be- 
fore they have finished, declare to the 
world that they may go their own way, 
suit their own inclination, follow any 
road they will, for so great is the love 
of God and the mercy of Jesus Christ 
that He Avill save them in the end. 
"Bread is the way and wide is the 
gate which leadeth to destruction, and 
rr.airy there be who go in thereat, be- 
cause straight is the gate and narrow 
is the way which leadeth to life, and 
few there be that find it." And why 
is it that few find it? It is because 
men preach these false doctrines of 
"meandering" roads and give to man- 
kind their choice of a number of paths. 
They say you may follow the roads 
which lead through the sweet scented 
woods of sin; you may follow that road 
which parallels the enticing streams 
of vice and corruption; you may walk 
through the meadows of your own per- 
nicious inclinations, if you will, and 
aftev all, the love of God will save

you; for, "He so loved the world that 
He gave His Only Begotten Son, that 
whosoever should believe on Him 
should not perish, hut have everlast- 
ing life." But they neglect to add, 
"I am the way, the truth, and the life; 
and no man cometh to the Father hut 
toy me." Because of such teachings 
as this, men go astray; they imagine 
to themselves that they are secure in 
following after their own wills, and 
they forget that they must do the will 
of God to be saved. They forget that 
"he that goeth not in at the door of 
the sheepfold, but seeketh to climb up 
some other way, is a thief and a rob- 
ber." It may be said that this kind 
•of doctrine preached from the pulpits 
is a broadminded doctrine; it embraces 
the fatherhood of God and the brother- 
hood of man. People have made catch 
phrases of the fatherhood of God and 
brotherhood of man. The Apostle 
John said of the Savior, "He came un- 
to His own, and His own received Him 
not; but to as many as received Him, 
to them gave He power to become the 
sons of God" — not to those who did 
not receive Him. The Savior told some 
of the people at one time that they were 
■children of their father the devil, who 
was the father of lies. "Why? Because 
they would not receive Christ, but 
rather received the evil and preferred 
a refuge of lies. Now then, if that is 
broadmindedness, it is the broadmind- 
edness of the broad way, and men in 
that broad way may meander, and cir- 
cle, and waltz as they please, but they 
will never find the straight gate, but 
will enter the wide gates to destruc- 
tion. If it is narrowminded to say 
that "straight is the gate and narrow 
is the way that leadeth unto life, and 
few there be that find it," it is not my 
narrowness, but it is the narrowness 
of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the 
world. But what about this narrow 
way? "Why, brethren and sisters, it is 
wide enough to contain the whole 
world, if the people of the world would 
but enter it and march forward with 
their attention set upon the gate which 
is straight. They could walk many 
thousands abreast, too, without difficul- 



ty. It is the path of duty, and 6? obe- 
dience to the things the Savior taught, 
for He said: 

"Whosoever heareth these sayings of 
mine, and doeth them, I will liken him 
unto a wise man, which built his house 
upon a rock: 

"And the rains descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell not: 
for, it was founded upon a rock. 

"And everyone that heareth these say- 
ings of mine, and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
which built his house upon the sand: 

"And the rain s descended, and the 
floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell: and 
great was the fall of it." 

It is folly to suppose that you can 
gain a salvation in the kingdom of God 
while you are breaking the command- 
ments of God. It is folly to suppose 
that the broad way, and those roads 
that meander and curve, and turn away 
from the straight and narrow path will 
lead to that gate which entereth into 
life. You Latter-day Saints under- 
stand this. These are the things we 
are trying to convince the world of. 
"He that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved," are the words of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and must be added 
to those other sayings of His, viz. that 
"God so loved the world that He gave 
His Only Begotten Son, that whosoever 
should believe on Him should have eter- 
nal life," etc. We must take all the 
words of the Savior; live by every word 
that proceedeth from the mouth of God, 
follow in the paths of truth, and keep 
the Lord's commandments; then there 
will be salvation for us. 

The condition of the world today is 
very much like that described by Paul 
when he wrote the "time would come 
when they would not endure sound doc- 
trine, but after their own lusts would 
they heap to themselves teachers, hav- 
ing itching ears, who would turn their 
ears away from the truth and unto fa- 
bles." Such doctrines as that about 
many roads may on the face of them 
appear broadminded and liberal, but 
they are fables, and their followers will 
go to destruction unless they repent. 

Again Paul wrote: 



52 ELDER GEORGE 

"This know also, that in the last days 
perilous times shall come. 

"For men :-hall be lovers of their own 
selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
blasphemers, disobedient to parienjts, 
unthankful, unholy, 

"Without natural affection, truce- 
breakers, false accusers, incontinent, 
fierce, despisers of those that are good, 

"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of 
pleasure more than lovers of God; 

"Having a form of Godliness, but de- 
nying the power thereof: from such 
turn away. 

"Ifor of ithis sort axe Jlhey which; |creep 
into houses, and lead captive silly wo- 
men laden with sins, led away with 
divers lusts." 

A better description of the present 
condition of the world could scarcely be 
written. Whether or not this predic- 
tion bad reference to a former or a 
latter day, Ave see a remarkable ful- 
fillment of it in out own time. There 
are many who answer well this descrip- 
tion, and it. is this sort of men who 
have been prominent in persecuting the 
Saints, and who, in the last year or 
two, have crept into houses and led 
captive several millions of silly women. 

"But evil men and seducers shall wax 
worse and worse, deceiving, and being 
deceived." 

My brethren and sisters the kingdom 
of God will triumph in s pite of it^ all. 
Therefore, follow in the way of life; 
follow the directions of the servants of 
God; keep your feet in the straight 
way, and you shall be saved, and the 
world cannot prevent it. At the same 
time do your best to persuade, by love, 
kindness, consideration and instruction, 
all men to enter with you. God bless 
the Saints, in the name of Jesus. Anion. 

A tenor solo, "He Leadeth Me," was 
sung by Elder Wm. D. Phillips of the 
Tabernacle choir.

given to previous speakers, and that 
the Spirit of the Lord may be present 
with me, that what I say may be 
profitable, that we may all be benefited 
and continue to enjoy the blessings that 
have been poured out upon us 
during this conference. This is 
the greatest gathering of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints upon a Sabbath 
morning that it has been my 
privilege to witness. The necessity for 
an overflow meeting this morning evi. 
dences that the people are interested, 
and desire to b e present when the ser- 
vants of the Lord are called upon to in- 
struct them. I am pleased to observe 
the cheerful manner in which the sug- 
gestion of President Smith has been 
complied with. It is customary for us, 
when instruction is given, to think that 
that instruction was meant for some- 
body else, but I noticed that the people 
who are sitting concluded that Presi- 
dent Smith's advice was meant for 
them, and they have moved closer to- 
gether, and some have changed places 
with those who were standing in the 
aisles. I say it pleases me, because i 
realize that we took the instruction to 
heart ourselves. If we will do that in 
all the discourses that are delivered, 
and keep our e ars open for the sound 
of those truths which are declared un- 
to us, we will be likely to conform our 
lives to the Gospel, correct mistakes 
we have already made, and try to 
do better. If we conclude that the in- 
struction is meant only for somebody 
else, we are liable to continue in the 
same old way to the end of our days, 
and discover when it is too late that 
the advice was for us as well as for the 
other person. 

I desire to emphasize an assertion 
that has been made during this confer- 
ence, that the home industries in this 
state have languished; this applied tc 
all of us. The disposition of the Latter- 
day Saints toward home industries has 
changed somewhat. To a certain degree 
we are responsible for the lack of em- 
ployment that exists in some of our 
communities. Let us remedy this, and 
try to patronize home institutions more 
fully. We should purchase home manu.. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



53 



factured products, for, when we do 
that, the means we pay out does not go 
to some distant land but is retained in 
our own community. In this way we 
may largely become independent and 
self-supporting. It should be our rule 
when we go to the store to inquire for 
and purchase articles that are manu- 
factured or produced at home. Teach 
this to our families, and in that way 
we will assist in providing our own peo- 
ple with employment, build up the 
country, and encourage those who live 
among us to invest their money in en- 
terprises in our own community. 

I believe it may be interesting to this 
great congregation if I shall detail t<* 
you some of the circumstances connect- 
ed with the recent visit made by Presi- 
dent Smith and a number of members 
of the Church, to the state of Vermont, 
where a beautiful monument was dedi- 
cated to the memory of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith. 

On the 18th day of December last there 
left this city, in a private car, 30 souls, 
29 of whom had been invited by Presi- 
dent Smith to accompany him to the 
dedication of the monument. I desire 
to say that we all, including President 
Smith, paid our own expenses. I have 
heard that some people were fearful we 
had received some special favor from 
the tithing fund of the Church. I had 
■charge of the finances and the business 
management of that party, I therefor 
know what I am talking about. Not 
many Latter-day Saints have felt sus- 
picious about this matter, but some 
who do not pay tithing seem unduly 
anxious for fear someone else shall 
■benefit by the tithes other people pay. 

By the kindness of the railroad com- 
panies, the car in which we journeyed 
was taken from place to place with 
great rapidity and without unnecessary 
delay. All along the road, from the 
tim e we left the depot at Salt Lake. 
City until we arrived at South Royal- 
ton, Vermont, the railroad officials 
looked after the welfare of the party, 
and many general officers of the vari- 
ous railroads came aboard to see that 
every possible convenience and comfort 
were proviided. "We arrived at our des- 



tination without difficulty, after a 
splendid journey across the contineni. 
It was a great change for some mem- 
bers of our party, who had crossed the 
plains in early days with ox teams, 
and some with hand-carts, when it was 
dangerous to travel because of the In- 
dians. Some had known the privations 
and difficulties of frontier life, having 
wended their way to this country dur- 
ing the pioneer peopling of the valleys. 
Now they were permitted to go over 
the same route on a great railroad, in 
a palatial car, with all the comforts 
and conveniences that could be furnish- 
ed. 

We had beautiful weather while going 
to our destination, until the evening of 
the 21st, when we encountered snow, 
the first we had seen since leaving 
home. We arrived at South Royalton, 
the railroad station at which we went 
to leave the train, on the morning of 
the 22nd. There we found that about 
five or six inches of snow had fallen 
during the night, and this provided ex- 
cellent sleighing for the party, most 
of whom went to Tunbridge, which was 
the home of the grandfather of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. We examined 
the town records there, and were treat- 
ed with kindness by the people. I 
should have stated that, on arrival at 
South Royalton we were met by Elder 
Junius P. Wells, who had been in 
charge of the construction of the mon- 
ument, and found that he had made all 
necessary arrangements for us at that 
end of the line. The people of South 
Royalton were waiting to make us wel- 
come; they had decorated, festooned, 
and seated a comfortable hall, where 
we held meetings and gather- 
ings and became acquainted with the 
people. We appreciated all this, 
and every member of the party was 
made to feel that we were in the hands 
of friends. President Smith and asso- 
ciate leaders were especially sought af- 
ter and received most kindly welcome 
on every hand. 

It was a singular thing that last sea- 
son practically no snow had fallen in 
that section up to that time; the wea- 
ther had been pleasant and mild. To

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



my mind it was an evidence of the 
blessing of our Heavenly Father on the 
erection of the monument to the mem- 
ory of the man He chose to open this 
latter-day dispensation. On the after- 
noon of the 22nd, we met about thirty 
members of the Church, who had come 
from New York and Boston to partici- 
pate in the dedicatory services. These 
visitors, with the company from Utah, 
and residents of South Royalton, as- 
sembled in the evening and were agree- 
ably entertained by some of Zion's 
sweet singers, including Lulu Gates, 
Robert Easton and Ellen Thomas. 

On the morning of the 23rd of Decem- 
ber, the 100th anniversary of the birth 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
the people of the surrounding 
country began to gather at the 
South Royalton hotel, where mem- 
bers of the party were stopping. Be- 
cause of the thaw on the night of the 
22nd, the snow had largely disappeared, 
and the result was that the people 
brought conveyances of various kinds- 
sleighs, wagons and carriages. We 
were informed by Brother Wells that 
these vehicles were furnished gratis by 
the citizens, to convey the Utah party 
and friends to the site of the monu- 
ment. We were duly seated in the 
carriages, etc., and safely reached the 
place Avhere the dedicatory services 
were to be held. Arriving there, we 
beheld a beautiful monument and a 
lovely cottage. We were astonished to 
see what had been wrought within the 
short time that had elapsed since 
Brother Wells had gone down there to 
supervise the work. The Church had 
purchased about 80 acres of the land 
surrounding the birthplace of the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith, including the or- 
chard, the old cellar, and the hearth- 
stone of the home in which he was 
born. We found there had been built 
around and over the hearthstone, 
which retained the original place it had 
formerly occupied, a beautiful home, 
where will reside a care-taker of the 
property and of the monument. A pe- 
culiar feeling and influence came over us 
as we realized that we were standing 
on the ground where the Prophet first 



beheld the light; an event that we may- 
say, marks the beginning of "Mormon- 
ism;" and that this location is now the 
property o£ the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. Our tears flowed 
freely, under the influence of the Spirit 
every soul was humbled, every heart 
was melted, and we rejoiced in the 
blessings of our Heavenly Father. 

The people began to gather, coming in 
wagons, or on horseback, or walking, 
until several hundred had assembled. 
The house would not hold them, so 
overflow services were held outside, 
while the dedicatory services that had 
been arranged for were being conduct- 
ed in the house. The people rejoiced 
with us. They had appointed one of 
their number, Dr. Fish, to speak words 
of welcome, and he complimented the 
people of Utah, and the Church, for 
having completed in their locality a 
monument of such exquisite beauty. 
They were delighted and pleased, and 
desired us to understand that they 
would assist in protecting the property 
from vandalism, and that it would be 
safe in their community. He said they 
honored us for the work that had been 
done. Brother Junius F. Wells made a 
report of his labors during the course 
of the meeting. While he addressed us 
we were gladdened in our hearts to ob- 
serve that he had warmed the feelings 
of that community towards him, and 
won their love and respect; they seemed 
to look upon him almost as one of their 
own. An account of the services has 
already been published, including the 
dedicatory prayer, and almost every 
thing pertaining to the occasion, but I 
will refer to some incidents that have 
not been printed, at least I have not 
seen them in print. 

Many people do not understand what 
a great task it was to get this monu- 
ment in position. The shaft itself 
weighs somewhere near forty-three 
tons. It is erected upon high ground, 
and had to be carried five and a half 
miles from the railroad upon a specially 
prepared wagon, the wagon weighing 
eight tons, the tires of the wheels being 
twenty inches wide. The country road 
could not bear the great weight of the

immense blocks of stone of which the 
monument is constructed, and a track 
of oak planks was laid upon the ground 
and the big wagon was rolled upon 
that. When the first effort was made 
to haul it, twenty of the best horses in 
that country could not move the wa- 
gon. Afterwards, by means of block 
and tackle, it was successfully moved, 
although sometimes only a few yards, 
or a few rods a day, until the monu- 
ment was gradually taken to its desti- 
nation. The people of that country 
said to Brother Wells, "You will not 
be able to get it into position because 
of storms and snow; the roads will be 
so slippery that you cannot. haul it." 
Brother Wells said to them (evidencing 
the faith of his lineage) "We will get 
there, the Lord will open the way." So 
the storms held off until the monument 
was in place, the cottage roofed, and 
the doors and windows roughed in, then 
it began to snow. The people of that 
country refer to this two months of 
pleasant weather, at a time when or- 
dinarily they have snow, as Wells' wea- 
ther, in compliment to the man who had 
faith in our Heavenly Father in carry- 
ing: out the purpose undertaken. An- 
other thing was called to our attention, 
which interested those who lived there, 
the railroad men were afraid to carry 
the heavy stone across the railroad 
bridge over White river, so it was un- 
loaded from the railroad car onto the 
wagon.and then it was found the wagon 
bridge would have to be strengthened. 
Investigation showed that the bed of 
the stream was quicksand. Brother 
Wells, therefore, had planks placed on 
the quicksand to sustain the 
heavy timbers required to strength- 
en the bridge, and by that 
means they were able to accom- 
plish what they desired. Thus roads 
and bridges were made, and the people 
cheerfully assisted in the work. The 
block and tackle referred to had to be 
fastened to trees along the road and 
those who lived in that section per- 
mitted their trees to be used for that 
purpose, although it either barked or 
uprooted them. One place on the road 
was an especially bad obstacle; it was 



very marshy; and Brother Wells went 
to the Road Supervisor and asked if 
he could have it filled up. He smiling- 
ly replied that it was a noted land- 
mark in the country, and it would be 
impossible to fix it, the oldest inhab- 
itant unpleasantly remembers that dis- 
agreeable mudhole, "but," he said, "it 
is the only way you can go, and I am 
afraid we can not do anything to help 
you." The same evening they got 
there with the monument shaft, a hay- 
press sunk in the mire, and they could 
scarcely get it out. That night our 
Heavenly Father was petitioned to as- 
sist, for the great rock had to be taken, 
over that bog next day. During the 
night the temperature dropped 30 de- 
grees, the mud was frozen solid, and 
it proved to be about the best piece of 
road they encounered on the trip. 

After the dedication services, which 
were attended by people who mani- 
fested great interest, considerable lit- 
erature was distributed to those who 
seemed anxious to learn something 
about Mormonism. A meeting was 
held in the hall that had been pre- 
pared, on the night of the 23rd. Many 
gathered in from the surrounding 
towns and settlements, and we had a 
delightful time. The brethren pro- 
claimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ; 
told why we believed that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of the Lord, and 
testified to the divinity of his mission, 
and to the authenticity of the Book of 
Mormon. After the meeting the people 
remained to shake hands and ask ques- 
tions. We felt again that we were 
in the society of friends. 

The monument stands in a beautiful 
location. The newspapers of that sec- 
tion made the statement that it is the 
greatest structure of its kind in the 
state of Vermont; indeed, it is the 
largest polished shaft in America, and 
is characteristic of almost everything 
else in the way of building that has 
been done by the Church since its or- 
ganization. 

On Sunday, the 24th, we went to - 
Boston, where two meetings were held 
with the Saints. On Christmas day we 
visited the old home of Robert Smith, 



56 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the first ancestor of the Smith family 
in this country. We drank water out 
of the well that was, no douht, dug by 
iis own hands or by his family. We 
visited the home of Grandfather Asael 
Smith, who moved from the state of 
Massachusetts to the state of Ver- 
mont because he had been imprisoned 
and fined for entertaining the unpopu- 
lar Quakers, evidencing the disposition 
■of the man to do what he believed 
was right regardless of popular clamor. 
The records disclosed that Grandfather 
Smith was the first moderator of the 
TJniversalists' church in the town of 
Tunbridge. President Joseph P. Smith 
and some other members of the party 
were entertained in the home of one of 
the foremost men of the Universalists' 
Church in America, and ate Christmas 
dinner with him. 

We boarded the train on Christmas 
night and were taken westward. On 
the morning of the 26th, we arrived at 
the little station of Palmyra. There 
we found carriages awaiting us, and 
we began a tour, of that section of the 
country, visiting places of much inter- 
est to the Latter-day Saints. We went 
tc the former home of the father of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, where Joseph 
came with the plates after he had re- 
ceived them from the hand of Moroni, 
and where, it is said, he received the 
manifestations of the angel, who ap- 
peared to him three times in one night. 
We went into the grove where Joseph 
had knelt down and asked the Lord 
to inform him which one of the 
churches he should join. We were 
impressed to sing, in that hallowed 
place, the beautiful Mormon Sunday 
school hymn, "Joseph Smith's First 
Prayer." Mr. Chapman, who owns 
that property, and who accorded us 
every possible courtesy, informed us 
that the grove we went into never had 
a tree cut down. The property had 
fallen into the hands of his father af- 
ter our people had moved away, and 
he had held those woods sacred, and 
they took their timber from other 
groves around there. We were taken 
inside the house and shown the room 
where a part of the Book of Mormon 



had been translated. We drank water 
out of the well that was supposed to 
have been dug by the father of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. The house was 
built by his brother Alvin. Every 
kindness and consideration possible 
was extended to us by Mr. W. Avery 
Chapman, who now owns the proper- 
ty. In the stream of water in the 
pasture, near the house, is a place that 
had evidently been dug out, making a 
pool sufficiently large for baptisms, and 
we were informed that some of the 
first baptisms of the Church, after 
those in Seneca Lake, were performed 
in that little pool. It has been left 
as it was,and they have never straight- 
ened up the ditch bank. 

We visited the Hill Cumorah and 
were accorded the courtesy of going 
thereon by the wife of Mr. George 
Sampson, a brother of Admiral Wm. 
Sampson, who before his death owned 
the property. When we went up there 
and looked around, we felt that we 
were standing on holy ground. The 
brethren located, as near as they 
thought was possible, the place from 
which the plates of the Book of Mor- 
mon were taken by the Prophet. We • 
were delighted to be there. Looking 
over the surrounding country we re- 
membered that two great races of peo- 
ple had wound up their existence in the 
vicinity, had fought their last fight, 
and that hundreds of thousands had 
been slain within sight of that hill. 
Evidence of the great battles that have 
been fought there in days gone by are 
manifest in the numerous spear 
and arrow-heads that have been 
found by farmers while plowing 
in that neighborhood. We were 
fortunate enough to obtain a few of 
the arrowheads. Upon the hill, near a 
little grove of timber, the party stood 
and sang that glorious hymn: 

An angel from on high 
The long, long silence broke; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious w r ords he spoke: 

Lo! in Cumorah's lonely hill, 
A sacred record lies concealed. 

And then, under the inspiration of the 
Lord, President Smith offered one of 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 



57 



the most profound and beautiful pray- 
ers I have ever listened to. Everyone 
present was melted to tears. We felt 
the presence of the Spirit of our Father; 
and all who were there can testify that 
it was one of the most supremely happy 
moments of their lives. After that 
memorable experience we returned in 
the carriages to Palmyra and were en- 
tertained by some of the prominent cit- 
izens of that town. "We were shown 
by Pliny T. Sexton a full set of the or- 
iginal sheets of the first edition of the 
Book of Mormon. We saw the old 
printing press upon which it was print- 
ed; and were received with much kind- 
ness and courtesy by everybody whom 
we met. 

That night we took train and re- 
sumed the journey westward, arriving 
the next morning in the city of Cleve- 
land, from whence we went by street 
car to Willoughby, and proceeded by 
other conveyances from there to Kirt- 
land, the old home of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Com- 
ing in sight of the "town the first thing 
that greeted our vision was the beau- 
tiful temple of Kirtland, and as we be- 
held it we felt that there was one sa- 
cred building that had passed from the 
hands of the Latter-day Saints. I hope 
the day will come, ir it be the will of 
our Father, that it will again be pos- 
sessed by the Church that built it. It 
was there that the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and Sidney Rigdon saw the Savior upon 
the breastwork of the pulpit. It was 
there that Moses committed to them 
the keys of the gathering of Israel; 
and that Elias and Elijah came in the 
power and majesty of their great call- 
ings, and delivered the keys that had 
been committed to their care in the 
days of their ministry on the earth. 

We were received very kindly by 
Mr. U. S. Green, one of the apostles 
of the Reorganized Church. He took 
us through the various rooms of the 
building, and many us were made 
to feel in our hearts grateful to the 
Lord that we were permitted to stand 
upon what had indeed been holy 
ground. When we realized that the 
building was constructed by people in 
extreme poverty, how courageous men 



worked during the day to lay the 
foundations and build the walls of that 
structure, and then at night stood and 
defended it with weapons against those 
who had sworn that the building should 
never be completed, we could not help 
but feel that it was no Avonder the Lord 
■received their offerings and blessed 
them as few people have been blest 
upon The earth. We saw the little town 
of Kirtland and some of the houses 
that were built in early days by the 
men who lived there, among others the 
home where the Prophet resided, and 
where the Patriarch had lived. The 
old home of Sidney Rigdon, and some 
others are still standing, but are fast 
going to decay. Practically no new 
structures are being erected, and it is 
only a little village, while the people 
who moved from that section of coun- 
try out into the wilderness of the 
Rocky Mountains have builded a com- 
monwealth, and have taught hundreds 
and thousands of our Father's children 
to honor and glorify His name. 
. Then we resumed our journey home- 
ward again, receiving everywhere on 
our return trip the same courtesies as 
we had before. At Chicago we were 
met by people from Kenosha and taken 
in a special train to large manufactur- 
ing establishments in that town, and 
in Racine. Everybody extended to 
President Smith the right hand of fel- 
lowship, and kindness without stint 
were extended to him and to his party 
wherever we went. After holding a 
delightful meeting with the Saints in 
the city of Chicago, we continued 
westward. I must tell you that every 
night before we retired, from the time 
we left until we returned, President 
Smith gathered his little family around 
him (he treated us as such), the hymns 
of Zion were sung as we sped aci'oss 
the plains, or through the cities, and 
prayer was offered before we retired to 
our beds. The last night on our return 
journey, as the old year was passing 
away and the new year being ushered 
in, we crossed a section of country 
where our people had wandered many 
weary steps. We were called together 
by President Smith, and after singing 
several of the songs of Zion, each 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



member of the party was permitted to 
testify of the goodness and mercy of 
our Father unto us. The Spirit of the 
Lord was poured out upon us, and we 
shed tears of joy and happiness. We 
thanked God that we had been permit- 
ted to go upon this journey. Only one 
regret entered into our hearts, and 
that was, that more of the sons and 
daughters of Israel had not been able to 
avail themselves of the same blessed 
privilege. On the morning of the first 
day of January, 1906, after a journey 
of two weeks without sickness, accident 
or delay, with no unkind word, and 
with nothing but brotherly love from 
our Father's children wherever we met 
them, we were welcomed home by our 
families, and ate our New Year's din- 
ner with them. 

I say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that the 'work that was done in the 
erection of that monument is a credit 
to Junius F. Wells; and the completed 
structure is a credit to the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Many of our Father's children will re- 
ceive the testimony of the work of the 
Lord from meeting those who will labor 
and minister in that section of coun- 
try. What has been done there is a be- 
ginning of the building ud the waste 
places of Zion. In New Tork, Chicago, 
Denver, Chattanooga, Milwaukee, In- 
dependence, and many other places, 
there will be mission homes reared for 
the Latter-day Saint%, and places for 
the worship of the Lord. Zion will be 
redeemed, and the world, 'which now 
misunderstands the work of "Moirnon- 
ism," will live to know that it is the 
power of God unto salvation to those 
who will keep the commandments of 
our Father. My testimony is that the 
work grows apace, and that the chil- 
dren of men are receiving "Mormon- 
ism" in their souls; that it is the work 
of our Father. We may be puny and 
weak of ourselves,but if we will be vir- 
tuous and pure in our lives, if we will 
do what we know to be right, men and 
women will be raised to continue the 
work of the Lord, until our Father's 
work will have been done in the way 
that He desires. Thos,e who misunder- 
stand us now will know us better. 



Those who believe we have selfish mo- 
tives will be undeceived, and our broth- 
ers and sisters of the world, who desire 
the truth and wish to know what the 
Lord wants of them, will be pricked in 
their hearts and accept the Gospel. 
Zion will rise and shine, and will be- 
come the glory of the whole earth, the 
Lord God of Israel has so decreed. May 
God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "In 
Our Redeemer's Name." 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der Solomon Hale. 

Conference was adjourned till 2 p. m. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

An overflow session was held in the 
Assembly hall, commencing at 10:30 
a. m. The presiding officer was Elder 
Rudger Clawson, and Prof. Charles J. 
Thomas conducted the singing, assist- 
ed by the Temple choir. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn commencing, "How firm a 
foundation, ye Saints of the Lord." 

Prayer by Elder Bryant S. Hinckley. 

Singing by choir and congregation, 
"Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation." 

ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 

(President of Colorado Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
this morning with you in meeting in 
this assembly hall, in continuation of 
the great conference we have been 
holding, and I rejoice in the remarks 
that have been made during the meet- 
ings that have passed. I am gratified 
in the report That has been made by 
the Prophet of the Lord, showing the 
great prosperity that the people are 
enjoying at the present time. While 
I have been at this conference, I have 
had many evidences that prove to me 
that what President Smith said at the 
opening meeting is true. I could not 
help but remark this when I looked 
upon the faces of those children that 
furnished the music for the afternoon 
session yesterday. Zion is assuredly 
prospering and growing. I heard a 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 



59 



gentleman say something about pros- 
perous men the other day, and suc- 
cessful men, and I said, "By what rule 
do you measure your successful men 
in this world? Is it those who make 
a success in accumulating means?" 
And he said, "Well, I suppose that is 
the way I measured the successful 
men." In various avenues of life we 
have found men that have been very 
unsuccessful, although they have ac- 
cumulated means, and these men have 
been held up to the people as examples 
of honesty and integrity. But when I 
look upon the faces of the children of 
Zion, and hear their songs, and listen 
to their sweet voices, I feel within my 
heart that the parents of these chil- 
dren are successful, although they may 
not have much of this world's goods. 

In the mission where it is my privil- 
ege to preside, the Elders are per- 
forming a good work, preaching the 
Gospel among the people. They are 
meeting a great many people, making 
many friends, although very few con- 
verts are brought into the Church. 
Still with the friends that we are mak- 
ing, we feel amply repaid for the time 
and labor that has been spent in 
preaching the Gospel to the people. In 
many settlements and districts where 
xhe Elders have labored they are open- 
ing their doors today who have never 
done so before, and they are giving 
the Elders an opportunity to preach 
upon the street corners, although pome 
of the cities, towns and villages have 
refused the Elders this method of 
bearing their testimony. We feel that 
the hand of the Lord is in all this. We 
feel that He is protecting His great 
work, that He will bring it out tri- 
umphant, and that what puny man 
iray endeavor to do to overthrow it 
will be of no effect whatever, for we 
know it is the work of the Lord. We 
know that He is accomplishing His 
purposes, and often times He accom- 
plishes them in a way different to 
that we would follow if we were left 
to ourselves. 

There is a matter that I would like 
to speak about, and I feel that it 
should be taken notice of by the Lat- 



ter-day Saints. There are members of 
the Church going to Colorado, in dif- 
ferent parts of the mission, seeking 
employment among people who are not 
of us, whose sympathies are not with 
us, even among those who are opposed 
to this latter-day work. Some of our 
boys and girls come among those peo- 
ple, seeking employment, and in some 
instances older men and women, and as, 
the people are not in sympathy with 
us, they do not aid those who thus 
come in their midst, and they are cold 
and distant. These brethren and sisters 
come back again to us in the mission, 
and to the different stakes, and in this 
manner members of stakes are being 
scattered. Now we are trying to show 
them that most likely they are the 
ones who are at fault they are to 
blame for the condition which confronts 
them. Many times, as was said yester- 
day by one of the brethren, we too 
readily see the faults of others, but if 
we would just look within our own 
selves we would probably find the real 
cause for the complaint we have been 
making. 

You boys and girls, if you leave youi 
homes to go into our mission fields, if 
you go there to seek employment, or to 
study, or for recreation, it matters 
not what, you should first go to 
your Bishop, seek counsel from 
him, obtain his blessing before you 
depart, and I tell you that you- 
will be blessed if you will do this. 
But if you go there upon your own re- 
sponsibility, and mingle with people of' 
the world that you have not known, 
you will find that you have shouldered 
a serious responsibility. One day in 
our little meetinghouse, I saw the face 
of a young lady that seemed familiar 
to me. For a few moments I could - 
not place her, and then I remembered 
that I had met her in one of the wards 
of Zion, and I went up to her, and said, 
"What are you doing here?" She said, 
"I am trying to get a little rest. I 
have walked this city from one end to- 
the other, and ten miles out, seeking 
employment. I have answered every 
likely advertisement that I have seen« 
in the paper, and I don't know what to> 



60 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



do." I said, "The best thing- you can 
do is to go home; there is the place, go 
home where you belong." She said, "I 
thought I did not get enough wages at 
home, I thought the people were not 
treating me as they ought to do, but 
now I realize that I alone am to blam<s v 
Now," she said, "how am I to get home, 
I have spent all the money I had, and 
I am without anything to help myself." 
I said,. "You go up stairs, my wife will 
take care of you. Tou rest a while, 
and we will talk the situation over and 
see what can be done." The result was, 
she came back to her home in Utah, 
and is glad she is again here. Tou 
could not get that girl to go out into 
Colorado, or into California, to seek 
•employment again. 'She went awaj 
without the blessing of her Bishop. 
She went away without the blessing of 
her people, and she went upon her own 
responsibility. There are others who 
do the same thing, but some of them 
do not return in as good shape, or es- 
cape as easily as she did. I am sorry 
to say that some of them fall by the 
way side, and will never get over it 
as long as they live, never can wipe 
out the stain that has come upon them. 
My advice is, remain at home, al- 
though you may not get just as much 
wages as you might in the world. Re- 
main at home under the influence of the 
servants of God, where you can re- 
ceive counsel from your Bishop, and 
where you can attend and be benefitted 
by the Sunday School, the Mutual Im- 
provement Associations and othei 
means of comfort and blessing in Zion. 
Our Elders are doing all they possibly 
can to befriend girls they find in the 
mission who have drifted away from 
home. Some of these girls have be- 
come discouraged, and have married 
non-members of the Church, and they 
are sorry for that. They would gives 
all their lives if they could 
only return again. I would like to 
sound this warning in the ears of ev- 
ery man and woman in the Church 
who is thinking- about leaving home, 
and I would like to have them under- 
stand and see it as I see it. 

When you let your sons or your 



daughters go out to preach the gospel 
in the world they are safe. I was very 
much impressed with the remarks of 
Brother Kimball the other day, in re- 
gard to this matter. When you send 
your sons or daughters into the mis- 
sion field, you send them there under 
the protection of God, our Eternal 
Father, and the prayers that you offer 
up in their behalf. You do not feel 
sorry or worried about their condition, 
and what temptations, even, they will 
have to meet, or as to their ability to 
overcome the temptations. You do not 
feel concerned over these things, for 
you know they are in the hands of 
God, you know they are strengthened 
and blessed by His power, by His 
Holy Spirit, and are sustained under 
that influence; and you are perfectly 
willing to trust them among the na- 
tions of the earth, in the cities of the 
world, wherever they may be sent and 
feel that they will return again to 
their homes in safety. President Ben 
E. Rich said yesterday that, of the 
thousands of missionaries that had 
been sent to him in the mission field, 
he could count on the fingers of one 
hand all the Elders who had fallen 
and returned with a dishonorable re- 
lease. I have been connected with the 
Colorado mission almost since the first 
Elders went into that field, and can 
say that all the Elders who have come 
home from there have returned pure 
and unspotted from the sins of the 
world. They have come home unde- 
fined, and can look their fellow men in 
the face and say, "I have performed 
my duty to the best of the ability God 
has given me." 

Our mission district embraces a 
variety of climate. In one part there 
is perpetual snow, and in another part 
we almost have the tropics, tropical 
fruits grow there. We have, there- 
fore, the opportunity of transferring 
our Elders to places that will be fa- 
vorable to their health conditions. We 
have the dry climate that is suitable to 
some conditions, and for recovery from 
some diseases; and we have the moist 
climate, where it rains a great deal. 
Our Elders have been transferred from 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



61 



one part of the mission to the other, 
as may be deemed necessary, and their 
health has been kept good. Very few- 
Elders have returned who have been 
afflicted or sick, and we have never 
lost an Elder by death in that mission 
field. A very few of the Elders have 
had typhoid fever, or pneumonia, but 
other diseases have not afflicted them. 
It is stated by the physicians of Colo- 
rado that there is no such thing as 
malarial fever in that state, unless it 
has been brought there from other 
parts of the country. Therefore, your 
sons and daughters who are laboring 
in that mission field are in a healthy 
country, where they can be transferred 
in such manner as will conduce to 
their health. If we find that a damp 
climate does not agree with them, we 
transfer them to a higher and dryer 
place that puts new life into them, and 
they go forth with new energy in the 
performance of their duties. Elders 
have been transferred to Colorado 
from Great Britain on account of their 
health, and from the Southern and 
the Northern states, and these Elders 
have, in every instance, soon regained 
their health and performed mission 
work. Tour girls who have been sent 
as missionaries to that field are also 
in good health. I am very much 
pleased with the success of the ladies 
in the mission field. Our sisters in 
Denver are busy, in fact have more 
than they can do in meeting the ap- 
pointments made for them by the El- 
ders. People say, "We would like to 
talk with some of your women; we 
would like to hear Mormonism from 
the women's standpoint." Our sisters 
visit the homes of the people, answei 
questions for them, read to them, and 
teach their children, where the Elders 
do not have access to the homes. They 
are accomplishing a great work; we 
have a noble band of them in the mis- 
sion field at the Dresent time, and ti a 
People sing their praises. 

Brethren and sisters, I am thankful 
for the Gospel, and the testimony that 
the Lord has given unto me. I am 
thankful that I have been born of 
goodly parents in the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am 
thankful for the word of God we re- 
ceive from the men who stand as His 
mouthpieces unto the people in this 
generation. 

My brethren and sisters, we are liv- 
ing in a critical time for this people, 
a time when it requires all the faith 
we can muster in order to remain true 
and faithful to the covenants we have 
made. Let us keep our eye upon the 
servants of God, that He has raised up 
in this dispensation. Let us follow 
their lead, and God will bless this peo- 
ple and bring them off triumphant, 
which may He do is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
exceedingly in the labors that have 
been acomplished by the Latter-day 
Saints for the salvation of mankind. I 
reverence those men and women who 
are laboring for Zion and her inter- 
ests and welfare, both at home and 
abroad. I do not believe there is any- 
thing else in all the world that will 
compare with the unselfish devotion 
shown by members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It 
has oft times been said that this is an 
individual work; there is something 
for each one to do. Ordinarily, in the 
world, we hear them speak of the 
clergymen and the laymen; sometimes. 
I wonder what they mean. I presume 
they mean that clergymen are those 
who advocate the doctrines of the gos- 
pel, who are preaching the word, and 
laboring in the vineyard of the Lord; 
and by the term laymen, I presume 
they mean those who lay down and do 
nothing in that line. I do not know 
whether that would be considered a 
correct interpretation, but that is the 
thought that comes to my mind; and I 
rejoice in the fact that we have no 
laymen, in that sense, among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, but that all are ex- 
pected to labor for Zion and her inter- 
ests. And what a grand labor it is 
that we are engaged in, a labor that 
our Father has imposed upon us for ■

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the salvation of the souls of the chil- 
dren of men! What a noble work it is! 
What an army of laborers there are! 
We send forth a host of missionaries 
into various parts of the world, upon 
the island* of the sea, into foreign 
lands beyond the ocean, and also to 
the states and territories of our na- 
tive land! Our sons and daughters 
are thus laboring for the salvation of 
the souls of men. Here at home we 
^.re organized into various associations, 
quorums of the Priesthood, Stakes of 
Zion, Wards, Sunday Schools. Mutu- 
al Improvement associations, and all 
of the .various organizations that have 
been founded and established among 
the people that the-"- might be educated 
to labor for the salvation of souls. If 
there be one who is not engaged in 
some part of this work, he also ought 
to be given something to do, and a 
reproach is upon the Bishop for neglect 
•of duty, unless it be, perhaps, that the 
unemployed one is not willing to en- 
gage in that labor. It seems to me that 
the work we have to perform is wor- 
thv of our best efforts and utmost en- 
ergies, and when we engage in it we 
ought to labor with all our might. Un- 
fortunately, we find some who go at 
this work in a half-hearted way, who 
treat it slightingly, and do not cheer- 
fully give their best energies and 
efforts, who are dilatory and neglect- 
ful of the labor that has been assigned 
to him or her. That kind of labor is 
not satisfactory to the Lord, and will 
not be rewarded by Him. If you were 
to labor in some mercantile establish- 
ment with a view simply for putting 
in time, not giving your best thought 
and energy in performing your duties, 
your employer would not be satisfied, 
you would have your wages reduced, 
or possibly you might be dismissed 
from the service. I believe that our 
Father in heaven expects zealous, en- 
ergetic work from those who are em- 
ployed in His vineyard. 

We read in the scriptures: "Seek 
ye first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness and all other things shall 
be added unto you." Let us analyze 
this scripture, and see if we cannot 



learn what the Lord expects of us. I 
think, if we will give it our attention 
for a few moments, we will come to 
the conclusion that He desires a great 
deal from us. As already stated. There 
are some who perform their work in a 
half-hearted way. Some young men 
engaged in Mutual Improve- 
ment association work will do a 
little, provided they easily find time to 
do it. They say, "I have got to earn 
my living, I have to work at that so 
many hours in the day, and when 
evening comes, if I am not too tired, 
and there isn't some amusement that 
I want to engage in, I will attend to 
the duties that have been assigned me, 
if I find enough time to spare." That 
is not the proper spirit of this work, 
and it is not satisfactory to our Father 
in heaven, who requires a great deal 
more at our hands. It is not seeking 
the Kingdom of God first, but is put- 
ting it second; it is contrary to the 
commandment of the Lord. On the 
other hand, we should ^feel that our 
first duty is to do that which the Lord 
requires of us. I should feel that, 
when a duty has been assigned to me, 
I will accomplish it if all else fails. I 
will labor, if need be, from early morn- 
ing until late at night, until my body 
is weary; and when I have labored to 
do what the Lord has desired of me, 
and have accomplished that work, 
then, if I can find time to earn a liv- 
ing I will do it, but if I can't I will 
starve if need be. Now that is what I 
understand the Scripture quoted 
means. But I do not think that any 
laborer in Zion who pursues that 
policy needs to starve. We find that 
those men and women who are devot- 
ing their lives to the doing of their du- 
ties are not beggars, nor suffering with 
poverty. Here is the promise, if you 
will seek first the kingdom of God 
and His righteousness all other things 
shall be added unto you. Have you 
faith in that? Do you believe that? 
If you do not, you do not believe in 
the promises of God. Now I hope no 
one will think I mean that he can 
justifiably neglect his daily vocation, 
and fail to provide for his family. That

is one of the duties God requires of 
him; but I do say, and yet not I, but a 
greater than I has said, "Seek ye first 
the kingdom of God and His righte- 
ousness;" and that should govern the 
laborers for Zion, both at home and 
abroad. If we give the Lord that al- 
legiance if we put Him and His king- 
dom first, and labor with an eye single 
to His glory, what a grand work will 
be accomplished by this magnificent 
■organization which our Father has es- 
tablished upon the earth for the salva- 
tion of the whole world! We are not 
placed upon this earth simply to eke 
•out an existence, to earn bread and 
butter, live a while and die. No, there 
is a grander and nobler purpose, that 
as, we come here upon this earth, ob- 
tain these tabernacles which the Lord 
designed should be His temples, and 
•seek to cleanse and purify them, that 
we may be prepared for the great 
■eternal life which is beyond. May the 
Lord help us to attain it, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

My brethren and sisters: The fact 
that we are here assembled in the 
morning, in an overflow meeting of 
the general conference is one among 
other evidences of the growth of the 
work of the Lord. 

I presume that when the great tab- 
ernacle on this block was erected, it 
was supposed by the brethren who ac- 
complished that very remarkable work 
— that is, remarkable when their cir- 
cumstances are taken into account — 
that for very, very many years there 
would be ample room for the gather- 
ing of . the people at the general con- 
ferences; but, in the course of time, 
it was found it was not equal to the 
requirements of the people upon the 
Sabbath afternoon, at least, and it 
became necessary to hold an over- 
flow meeting. Then, after a little 
while, it became necessary to hold the 
overflow meeting in the morning as 
well; and we find it necessary on this 
morning to hold such a meeting. I 



expect the time will come, as Israel 
shall continue to gather into the 
stakes of Zion and more representa- 
tives shall come from the various 
stakes to attend these conferences — I 
expect that we shall find it necessary 
to hold overflow meetings, not only 
upon the Sabbath day, but upon other 
days, until we will hold our general 
conference in sections. 

We will find ourselves in the same 
condition that the Nephites were in 
during the time that the Savior min- 
istered among them. They gathered 
together in such multitudes that it be- 
came necessary to divide them into 
groups, and to send members of the 
council of the Apostles to these dif- 
ferent groups to hold meetings with 
the people and dispense the word of 
God. And this in order to accommo- 
date the multitudes, who were gath- 
ered together. So I doubt not we 
shall have to do in the future. 

I think we may comfort ourselves 
with the reflection, however, that no 
matter into how many sections the 
conference may be divided, in order to 
accommodate people, we shall find that 
in every case, in every section, the 
word of the Lord will be there to 
meet the people and instruct them; 
and there will be no reason why that 
Spirit of the Lord will not be as po- 
tent in one division of the conference 
as it is in another; so that all the peo- 
ple may rejoice .in receiving instruc- 
tion from the one Spirit, from the one 
source, even as we, this morning and 
this afternoon, in the overflow meet- 
ings, may partake of the one influence 
that is present and dominant at this 
conference. 

And that is what we seek, that is 
what we come to these conferences for 
— to partake of the influence of the 
Spirit of God and receive instruction 
and enlightenment from it; and those 
who come hungering and thirsting for 
it shall not go away empty. 

I listened to a speaker, not long 
since, who expressed the conviction 
that "An inspired speaker requires an 
inspired audience." I believe that is 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



true. And if that is a conclusion 
drawn from the experience of one not 
of our faith — and the man in question 
was not of our religious faith — how 
much more abundantly true it is in our 
experience who have been so definitely 
taught the necessity for both speaker 
and hearer to be inspired by the 
Holy Ghost in order to understand 
divine truths. 

In my thought upon the Gospel and 
its development, there is no one thing 
connected with it which has more im- 
pressed me than the fact that of all 
the teachers, the Lord is the wisest in- 
structor. He adopts strictly scientific 
methods in teaching. He is a splendid 
workman. If He were to undertake to 
fashion or mould iron, I do not be- 
lieve He would attempt to bend It 
cold, but like a wise craftsman, He 
would heat the iron. If He desired to 
weld it together, He would put the 
metal into at least a half-fused state, 
so that there would be some prospect 
of uniting it, or welding it together. 
As He would heat the iron, and then 
bend it to His purpose or design, so in 
giving instructions to a prophet or to 
a people, we shall find that He pre- 
pares, the minds of the people to re-? 
ceive the truth before the truth is an- 
nounced. 

Have you ever studied the condi- 
tions under which the Lord gave reve- 
lations to the Prophet Joseph? If you 
have, you doubtless have been struck 
with this truth, namely, that in every 
case the mind of the Prophet was in 
an inquiring attitude towards God. 
How came he to receive that first, 
great revelation with which this work 
began, and by which he was brought 
into the very presence of God, the 
Eternal Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ? Why, you will find that he 
was inquiring of the Lord, anxious to 
know. And by putting himself in that 
attitude, he bore witness to the heav- 
ens that he was prepared to receive the 
truth, and hence the Lord revealed 
Himself fully unto this Prophet, creat- 
ed him in fact a witness for God in 
the earth; a witness who could speak 
to some purpose, and testify with 



power, because he knew. He had seen? 
the Lord, he had conversed with Him 
in the heavenly vision. He had receiv- 
ed a message from God; he had re- 
ceived knowledge of such a character 
that it must end in revolutionizing the 
whole world in respect of its concep- 
tion of the nature of God. You will find 
in every case where the Prophet 
received communication from God, it 
was the result of his asking. When 
others received revelations or intelli- 
gence from God it was because they 
came to the Prophet asking. Joseph 
Knight, Oliver Cowdery, Martin Har- 
ris, Samuel H. Smith. Joseph Smith, 
Sr., came to the prophet to enquire of 
God, and they received revelations, 
and commandments not a few. The 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles, some- 
times asked for revelations. That 
great revelation which sets in order 
the quorums of the Priesthood and 
puts them in their proper relationship 
one with another, that describes the 
extent and the boundaries also of their 
respective powers and authority — 
(Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 107) — 
that great revelation came for the in- 
struction of the Twelve Apostles and 
the Church of Christ, because the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles sent a 
written petition to the prophet, asking 
that he inquire of the Lord that they 
might know their duties, and that they 
might know the extent and also the- 
limits of their authority in the Church, 
that the mistakes and blunders they 
had theretofore made might not be 
repeated. The revelation on tithing 
came in response to the inquiry 
"Show us, O Lord, thy will concerning 
the tithing of thy people." And the 
revelation telling how it was to be dis- 
posed of came in response to a similar 
inquiry. The great law of marriage,, 
the system which includes the eternity 
of the marriage covenant, one of the 
most splendid principles ever revealed 
unto the children of men — the fact that 
the union between husband and wife- 
the holy family relations of children 
and parents, this great central, pri- 
mary truth concerning these relation- 
ships and their continuance in time 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



65 



and in eternity, came in response to 
earnest inquiry on the nart of the 
Prophet. Well now, you have these 
examples before you. and I admonish 
you Latter-day Saints, in coming up 
to the house of the Lord, in coming to 
conference, that you come with minds 
anxious to know and to learn; and in- 
asmuch as you come with this hunger 
for knowledge, this thirst for instruc- 
tion, you will find the Lord responsive 
to that spirit of inquiry in your minds 
and you shall not go away empty. 
"Blessed is he," said Jesus, "who hun- 
gers and thirsts after righteousness, 
for he shall be filled." But it is neces- 
sary that men come in a prepared state 
when they would have a blessing of 
the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, in 
thinking of the work of the Lord, the 
nature of my work calls upon me to 
study it as one of the world's great 
movements; to look upon this work of 
the Lord's and the doctrines it advo- 
cates in their relationship to the relig- 
ious world, its relationship to the state, 
its relationship to all the systems of 
philosophy that have ever been in the 
world; its relationshio also to all the 
dispensations of the gospel that have 
preceded it. "Viewing it from that 
standpoint, I am sure it is rising to 
take its place in the systems of the 
worlds' thought. It is a religious force 
that will give direction to the thoughts 
of men in respect of their relationship 
to Deity, and of the relationship of 
Deity to the world; the relationship 
that ought to obtain between man and 
man; the relationship that men sus- 
tain to the eternities that are to come. 
And viewing Mormonism from that 
standing point, a standpoint forced up- 
on me by reason of the work that I am 
engaged in as a teacher of the Mormon 
faith, and assisting in a humble ca- 
pacity to set forth its history, I find my 
faith growing in this great Latter-day 
work. I am as satisfied as I am that I 
live that the system of truth that God 
has revealed to His Church will dom- 
inate the thoughts of men in genera- 
tions to come; that it will gather to- 
gether in one' all truth, pertaining 



both to ideas and conduct, and fix the 
world's standards of philosophical 
thought and ethical action in ages 
yet unborn. I predict that to be the 
destiny of this work in which we are 
engaged. 

I would like to invite the thought of 
the Elders of the Church to this fu- 
ture destiny of the great Latter-day 
work. 

- I was very much interested in what 
Elder Wells was saying to you just 
now in regard to there being a great 
difference between our religious insti- 
tutions and the religious institutions of 
the world. The difference of distinc- 
tion for instance between laymen and 
clergy, as held in the Christian sects, 
and the absence of such a marked dis- 
tinction in our system. Still I am of 
opinion that it would be well for us to 
recognize this fact, that while our sys- 
tem truly affords opportunity for all to 
be active and to be workers in the hive 
of the gospel of Christ, yet there is a 
woeful neglect by us of some of those 
opportunities. I do not know but what 
we can do, and perhaps with some 
profit, what it is said the peacock does. 
When we contemplate this work of 
ours, its height, and depth and breadth 
and grandeur; when we contemplate 
its completeness of organization, we 
have a right to feel proud of it; yet all 
personal pride ought to be dismissed 
from the thought, because we have had 
very little to do with bringing it into 
existence. Our pride in it must con- 
sist in pride of what God hath 
wrought; and I suppose it is proper to 
be proud of what God has achieved. 
But I doubt whether we can be just as 
proud of our individual conduct and 
actions connected therewith. And this 
is the point at which the action of the 
peacock, referred to a moment since, 
comes in. You doubtess have observed 
that the peacock is a very beautiful 
bird, and among other things, it has a 
most splendid tail, one that it can 
spread out, fan-shaped, to catch an 
immense amount of sunlight, and 
wherever a beam of sunlight strikes it. 
it gilds it with many and ever chang- 
ing hues. The bird seems conscious 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and apparently proud of this face. It 
struts about the yard and spreads its 
tail to the utmost extension Co catch 
every sunbeam possible, that it may 
reflect all the glory of which it is cap- 
able: and yet, in the height of its 
pride, as it struts about, if it happens 
to glance down at its feet, bare, scaled, 
black and ugly, its pride van- 
ishes and it feels ashamed because 
of its ugly, black feet. So with us. 
We may be proud without limit of 
the Church which God has founded- 
but whether we may be as proud of our 
own. personal conduct within th e 
Church is a question that may present 
a different aspect. If we will think of 
it from this standpoint, I believe 
that we too will draw in our feathers 
as the peacock does; and see but little 
occasion for self glorification. I speak 
in this way because of my connection 
with the quorums of the Seventy, and 
the Young Men's Mutual Improvement 
Associations. When I contemplate these 
institutions, and think what might 
come of them, and then think of what 
they are, and how we fail to reach the 
high levels of excellence upon which 
we might be moving, it seems to me 
that a little wholesome reproof for the 
mental laziness that obtains among us 
is quite seasonable. I am not so very 
proud of the status of our Seventies 
quorum?. It seems to me that if our 
Seventies and all the quorums of the 
Priesthood could view the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ in some of its grander as- 
pects, they would find in it an incen- 
tive that would prompt them to more 
vigorous study of the doctrines of the 
Church until they would make those 
great truths which God has revealed 
more perfectly their own, before goinj, 
out into the nations of the earth to 
teach them. This is important, breth- 
ren, because if we are going to master 
this world, we must master it through 
our ideas, through the truths that God 
has given us; and we may not master 
the world even with that truth if we 
ourselves remain ignorant of it and its 
relations. And so, my brethren, the 
thing I would urge upon you, especially 
upon you who hold the priesthood, 



whether you are operating in Mutual 
Improvement Associations or in the 
quorums of the holy priesthood-my 
admonition to you is that you go more 
earnestly about acquiring a knowledge 
of these great truths revealed to us, 
that when the opportunity comes to 
you to be a witness for the Lord Jesus 
Christ among the nations of the earth, 
you may be effective witnesses; that you 
may have something of which you can 
testify to some purpose; that you may 
give an intelligent reason for the hope 
that is within you. If there is one thing 
more than another to be reproved in 
Israel today, it is a lack of mental ac- 
tivity and earnest inquiry concerning 
the great th'ngs that the Lord has re- 
vealed to His people in this dispensa- 
tion of the fullness of times. Now, 
don't regard me as an extremist in 
these things. It is necessary sometimes 
to contemplate things in their ex- 
tremes, in order that you may beget 
even a reasonable amount of activity 
among the people in any given direc- 
tion; and I present these thoughts to 
you, in the hope that you will de ad- 
monished by them to a more earnest 
effort to acquire an understanding of 
the great things that the Lord has so 
graciously committed to our keeping; 
and through which He expects that 
we, through an intelligent proclama- 
tion of them shall master the world. 
May the Lord bless you, is my prayer. 
Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
have listened with very much satisfac- 
tion to the testimonies of my brethren, 
and have felt a thrill of divinity in 
their remarks. If I shall be favored 
with the Spirit of the Lord as they 
have been, I shall also be able to say 
something that may bring joy to my 
heart and to yours. Brother Roberts 
alluded to the condition of the Prophet 
Joseph when he besought the Lord with 
a full desire to know His mind and 
will, to be inspired with intelligence, 
light and knowledge, and his petiton 
Avas answered in full measure. The 
personal manifestation of Divinity, the 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



67 



Father and the Son, was a fulfillment 
of the promise that He would give lib- 
erally to those that seek Him with full 
purpose of heart. The divine personal- 
ity of those heavenly beings came 
within the direct view and comprehen- 
sion of this humble youth, and from 
them he received a message of eternal 
truth, yea, an inspiration, and his joy 
was great, and his heart full of satis- 
faction in contemplating this wonder- 
ful manifestation. How. truly great it 
was he did not fully realize at the time, 
but in his humility he was prepared 
to receive further light and knowledge. 

Three years passed away, we are in- 
formed in the history of this mighty 
event, and the Prophet was again in- 
spired to seek the Lord with fervency, 
that his heart might be prepared for 
greater light, that the will of the Lord 
concerning himself and his future life, 
might be made known unto him. The 
Lord was again ready to answer that 
humble prayer, and He sent His ser- 
vant, the Angel Moroni, to communi- 
cate with him, to inform him of cer- 
tain mighty events that were to trans- 
pire in the near future pertaining to 
the welfare of the human family. This 
messenger also informed him of the 
existence of a sacred record, which 
record was engraven indelibly upon 
metallic plates, whose lustre had never 
been dimmed, whose beautiful charac- 
ters had never been erased nor corrod- 
ed by the elements or time, and had 
received perfect care which had pre- 
served it with all its sacred Gospel 
principles. This heavenly being also 
gave him to understand that he would 
be an instrument in the hands of the 
Lord of revealing this great mystery 
for the benefit of his fellowmen, that 
he should have power to translate the 
rr-tord by the gift of God. The mes- 
senger also informed him that Elijah 
the Prophet should, at some future 
time, commit to him the keys that 
would unlock the prison house of the 
dead, and he should have power to 
minister for their redemption; for the 
keys that Elijah should bring would 
turn the hearts of the children to their 



fathers, and the hearts of the fathers 
to their children, that when the Lord 
should come in His glory that He 
should find faith upon the earth, and 
the earth should not be smitten with 
a curse of unbelief. The young man 
was informed that he was to meet the 
messenger at the place where the rec- 
ords were concealed, once a year for 
the four succeeding years, to receive 
further instructions in regard to their 
translation, and to be reminded of the 
pi onuses of the Lord unto him. When 
the four years had expired, the Angel 
Moroni delivered the plates to Joseph, 
and the record was afterward duly 
translated for the benefit of the human 
family. 

In the early history of the Church, 
Kirtiand and the region round about 
became a Stake of Zion, and the Lord 
gave a revelation requiring the Saints 
to build a Temple at that place. If 
you will refer to the history of the 
Church, you will find that the people 
actually did accomplish that great 
work It was a stupendous work for 
them to undertake, the building: of a 
house of such magnitude, in the days 
of their poverty and distress. Presi- 
dent Heber C. Kimball records in his 
journal as follows 

"The work that we did in the day 
time on the Temple walls, we stood 
guard over at night with our fire locks 
in our hands to prevent them from be- 
ing torn down by our enemies, and yet 
amidst all this and the poverty of the 
Saints, and the fewness of their num- 
bers, they accomplished this work, they 
finished this house and dedicated it to 
the Lord, and He accepted of that 
house." 

I refer you now to the 110th section 
of the Book of Covenants: 

"The veil was taken from our minds, 
and the eyes of our understanding were 
opened. We saw the Lord standing 
upon the breastwork of the pulpit be- 
fore us. His eyes were as a flame of 
fire . . . and His voice was as the 
sound of the rushing of great waters, 
even the voice of Jehovah saying, I 
am the first and the last; I am He 
who liveth; I am He who was slain; 
I am your advocate with the Father 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



. . . for behold, I have accepted this 
house and my name shall be here." 

What a glorious testimony. What 
a marvelous finale this was to the ser- 
vices of the dedication of that house. 
The Saints had faith, they believed He 
would accept of their labors, but 
w'hen He proclaimied before the 
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery that He 
had accepted that house, and 
that His name was to be inscribed 
thereon, how sublime must have been 
their feelings, and how great their joy 
when they were told of that wonderful 
manifestation, and heard those words 
of divine acceptance which had fallen 
from the lips of the Redeemer of the 
World. 

Now if you will again refer to the 
revelation you will find the following: 

"After this vision had closed another 
great and glorious vision burst upon 
us, for Elijah the Prophet, who was 
taken to heaven without tasting death, 
stood before us and said, Behold, the 
time is fully come which was spoken 
of by the mouth of Malachi, testifying 
that he, Elijah, should be sent before 
the great and dreadful day of the Lord 
to turn the hearts of the fathers to 
the children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the Avhole earth be strick- 
en with a curse. Therefore, the kevs 
of this dispensation are committed into 
your hands, and by this ye may know 
that the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord is near, even at the doors." 

There was no baptismal font in the 
Kirtland temple, for the keys per- 
taining to the ordinances for the re- 
demption of the dead were not com- 
mitted to the Prophet until after that 
Temple was completed and dedicated. 
From that time until the present there 
has been a baptismal font placed in 
each Temple builded by the Latter-day 
Saints, in order that sacred ordinances 
might be performed for the living and 
for the dead. 

My brethren and sisters, "Mormon- 
ism" is the Gospel of peace, life and 
salvation. It has never been a Gospel 
of war or contention. Contention does 
not belong to the Spirit of the Gospel 
or the faith of the Saints; but evil and 



temptation exist in the world, and 
wherever it is manifest it is for the pur- 
pose of overthrowing the good, and 
this evil power has been fighting 
against the Latter-day Saints from 
the beginning, seeking to destroy the 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Though harassed and hated the work 
has continued to prosper, and the Lord 
has established His marvelous work 
and wcnder in the earth. The saying 
of our Savior has been realized arid 
demonstrated, "The world hated me, 
therefore it hateth you." Yet the Lord 
so loved the world that He gave His 
beloved Son for its redemption. The 
mission of the Latter-day Saints is 
now and always has been to try to 
convince the world that it is better to 
serve God than to serve mammon. But 
there is no force, no coercion in this 
Gospel. The spirit of peace, and f 
gentle persuasion, and of love unfeign- 
ed is characteristic or' our leaders, and 
it is pre-eminently exemplified in all 
their teachings that they realize the 
truth of the doctrine that the powers 
of the Priesthood are inseparably con- 
nected with the heavens, and if any 
man should desire to assume unright- 
eous dominion or exercise undue au- 
thority over his brethren, Amen to 
that man's Priesthood. The "Mormon" 
Elder, as he proclaims these grand 
principjes, also exemplifies the fact 
that he can call sinners to repentance, 
and teach them the better life, only by 
that spirit of gentle persuasion, which 
is so well expressed in the following 
lines: 

"Know then that every soul is free, 
To choose his life and what he'll be, 
For this eternal truth is given. 
That God will force no man to heaven. 
He'll call, persuade, direct aright. 
Bless him with wisdom, love and light 
In" nameless ways be good and kind. 
But never force the human mind." 

The choir and congregation sang, 
"O, say what is truth." 

Benediction by Elder Don C. Walker.

ELDER GEORGE C. PARKINSON. 

(President of Oneida Stake.) 

My brothers and sisters, in attempt- 
ing to say a few words this afternoon, 
I assure you I feel my weakness and 
inability, and trust I may be sus- 
tained by the same good spirit which 
has characterized this conference from 
the opening session. The Oneida Stake, 
ever which I have the honor to pre- 
side, is situated in Idaho. It occupies 
all that part of Cache "Valley which is 
north of the Utah line. 

In that Stake there are 17 regularly 
organized wards, with a population of 
6,000. The wards, quorums, and auxil- 
iary organizations are all, I believe, 
thoroughly organized. The people feel 
well in relation to their duties in tht; 
Church, and are, as a rule, availing 
themselves of the privileges and bless- 
ings to which they are entitled. The 
wards of the Oneida Stake are com- 
pact, I think the farthest distance 
across the stake, from north to south-, 
being about 20 miles. We are engaged 
largely in agriculture. Our part of the, 
country is developing and growing 
nicely. We are interested in the sub- 
ject of irrigation, and have expended, 
within the last two years, upwards of 
$400,000 in the irrigation system, con- 
sisting of canals and reservoirs, which 
when completed, after an expenditure 
of another $100,000, will bring into a 
higher state of cultivation between 30,- 
000 and 35,000 acres of good land. These 
are inducements to the homeseeker, 
those who are in search of good land 
at moderate prices; and we extend 
the invitation to all such to come and 
make their homes with us. We are 



building good meeting-houses ana 
school-houses, as well as other im- 
provements of a public character. Oui 
people are thrifty. I think I am safe 
in saying that fully 90 per cent of all 
the people who reside within the Oneida. 
Stake are members of the Church. 

Our schools are in a very creditable 
condition. We have established an 
academy at Preston, the headquarters 
of the Stake. Th e home of this insti- 
tution, a cut stone building, cost the 
people in the neighborhood of $50,000. It 
is attended today by about 300 students. 
The institution is offering courses in 
High school and Normal work, also 
manual training and missionary cours- 
es. I think it was announced at this 
conference that the Oneida stake has 
the credit of heading the list as to 
the number of young men taking the 
missionary course in the Church 
schools. We have 100 young men 
and young women engaged in the 
manual training division of the school, 
and they are doing very excellent 
work. The spirit of the institution is 
felt in every ward, and in every home, 
for good. It is turning out men and 
women qualified to take up the re- 
sponsibilities of life, in the school room 
as teachers, the counting house, the 
carpenter shops, and young men are 
going from there into all parts of the 
world to carry the message of glad 
tidings to the nations. We have to- 
day in the neighborhood of 90 mission- 
aries from Oneida stake in the world 
preaching the Gospel. This is a record 
of which we are proud. 

So far as I know, the people are 
united; they feel well, and are active 
in the discharge of their duties. The 
attention of the local authorities is oc- 
cupied largely with the young people, 
especially those bearing the .Lesser 
Priesthood, in teaching, training and 
educating them along the lines of their 
duties in connection with the responsi- 
bilities of the Priesthood which they 
bear. It is a joy to me to associate 
with the Saints of God. I. am very 
grateful that I am considered worthy 
of a standing and membership in the 
midst of the Latter-day Saints.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I am thankful that there has come 
to my understanding a knowledge of 
the Gospel, a testimony of its divinity, 
and I have no aim higher than to he 
faithful, to be constant in season and 
out in the discharge of duty, leading 
men and women, and especially the 
young people in our midst, in the right 
way. The work of the Lord is grow- 
ing, it is becoming magnified and 
stronger day by day. It is not as 
some people uninterested in its suc- 
cess would make themselves believe, 
waning, losing prestige and strength in 
the world. On the contrary the work 
of the Lord is gaining ground at home 
in the stakes of Zion, and abroad in 
the world. I bear witness before this 
vast congregation that I know God 
lives. I know that the work in which 
we are engaged is the work of the 
Lord. I know that those who are sus- 
tained by the prayers and confidence 
of the Latter-day Saints as the author- 
ities of the Church are inspired of 
God; they are endorsed by Him; they 
enjoy the inspiration of His Holy 
Spirit. It is a pleasure to me to listen 
to their teachings, to accept their 
counsel, to reduce it to practice in that 
which pertains to my interest in life. 
I pray that the Lord may bless and 
sustain them, and give them greater 
inspiration; and that He may bless His 
people. His cause; that the truth 
may be made known, and that the 
Church of Christ may have greater 
power, greater influence, greater pres- 
tige for good in the nations of the 
earth, as well as at home where it is 
more thoroughly established. May His 
peace and blessings be in our midst 
and abide with us always, is my prayer, 
in the name of Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM McLACHLAN. 

(President of Pioneer Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, in rising 
before you this afternoon, I desire that 
the Spirit of the Lord shall prompt the 
words that I shall utter. I have no de- 
sire to say anything to the people in 
and of myself, for I have found out by 



experience that nothing but the Spirit 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ can en- 
lighten the minds of the children of 
men, and bless them permanently. 

There is a revelation in the Book of 
Doctrine & Covenants from which I 
shall read the first verse, contained in 
the ninety-third section: 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord, it shrill 
come to pass that every soul who for- 
saketh their sins and cometh unto rue 
and calleth on my name, and obeyeth 
my voice and keepeth my command- 
ments, shall see my face and know that 
I am." 

This is a passage that has interested 
me very much of late. I have had a 
constant and increasing desire grow 
up in my heart to obtain the testimony 
that is promised unto those who keep 
the commandments of God, to behold 
the face of Him who came into ihe 
world in the meridian of time, and who 
did so much for you and for me. I 
desire to live in harmony with the Lord, 
so that I can receive, in His own due 
time, this testimony, that shall enable 
me to bear record of Him in truth. 
While I know by the revelation of the 
Spirit of God that this is His work, I 
also know that it has been promised 
in His word through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, that the Second Comforter 
will come unto the Latter-day Saints 
who have kept the commandments of 
God, who have been steadfast in their 
faith in His work. 

I have never had any desire to 
criticise or find fault with those 
who preside over me. On the 
contrary, I have had a constant desire 
to yield intelligent obedience to their 
counsel and instructions, and to fol- 
low them sooner than I would follow 
my own inclinations, sooner than I 
would do my own will. I desire that 
this spirit shall increase within me 
while I live upon the earth, that I may 
be found faithful and true in every 
particular, valiant in defending the 
truth that God has revealed, and in 
sustaining it by practice in my own 
life. 

When I was a boy, about 19 years 
of age, I received a testimony of the 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL, 



71 



truth of this work, through obedience 
to the word of God. That testimony 
was given to me for my individual ben- 
efit, and I have found it a great bless- 
ing and comfort all through my life. 
Had it not been for this first testimony 
that God gave me in my youth, I do 
not know where I would have been to- 
day; but it has preserved me, it has 
kept me stable and true to His work, 
willing to obey and to carry out the 
counsels of His will; and I feel today 
more willing than I have ever done in 
my past life to do the will of the Lord in 
whatever service He requires of me. I 
trust, my brethren and sisters, that we 
will ever strive to overcome our weak- 
nesses, and bring into subjection tu 
His will every inclination, every desire, 
every propensity or passion that would 
hinder the development of the powers 
He has implanted within us, not only 
for our own benefit but for the good 
and blessing . and salvation of the chil- 
dren of men. We have received the 
Holy Priesthood of the Son of God. 
That Priesthood twas given to you 
and to me for a purpose, not to gratify 
our own desires but to so live that 
the Priesthood should be magnified in 
the eyes of the people for the glory of 
our heavenly Father, the building up 01 
His work, and the salvation of His 
children. That man who does the most 
good towards the salvation of his fel- 
low men, that carries out the precepts 
of the Savior in this great and glori- 
ous work, is the on e that will be most 
approved by Heaven, because he hath 
assisted the Redeemer in accomplish- 
ing His purposes relative to His chil- 
dren. 

I do not desire to occupy more time 
this afternoon. I feel satisfied with 
my file leaders, with those that have 
been called to preside over us; I came, 
here in the days of President Brigham 
Young. I considered him one of the 
greatest men that I ever became ac- 
quainted with in my life. I see many 
things in his career, in his counsel, and 
in his life to admire today. So also 
those that have followed him, because 
of their fidelity and integrity and de- 
votion to the work of the Lord. I love 



to associate with men who are true, 
who are obedient, who are humble, and 
who cultivate a spirit that is ready 
and willing to do the bidding of our 
Heavenly Father under all circum- 
stances and conditions. 

That the blessing of the Lord may be 
upon this people, the Latter-day Saints, 
in all their abiding places throughout 
these mountain valleys, in all the dif- 
ferent stakes in which they are located, 
I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL. 

(President of St. Joseph Stake.) 

It is a great pleasure to me to come 
up to headquarters and see my friends, 
and mingle with the Saints of God. I 
was raised here in Salt Lake, and as- 
sociated with the people throughout 
the various stakes of Zion, in traveling 
and in missionary work, for many 
years, and now my abode is in Arizona. 
I have always fraid, it mattered iittle 
to me where' I lived so long as I could 
be associated with my people. 

I am happy in my relations with the 
Saints of God in the St. Joseph stake 
of Zion, in Arizona. Utah is dear to 
me, but Arizona today is still dearer. 
My interests and my home are there. 
As much as I love the place of my 
birth, and my many former friends 
and associates, there is no people so 
dear to me as the Latter-day Saints 
with whom I am associated in the 
stake of Zion where I am permitted to 
preside, and the good people who are 
not of our faith, in the territory of 
Arizona. I am somewhat acquainted 
with the inhabitants of these great 
mountain valleys, of the intermountain 
west, and in some of the states as far 
east as the Mississippi river; but, in 
all my travels I don't know that I 
ever came in contact with people so 
generous, so highminded and so liberal 
as are the Arizonians. The Arizona 
people, I mean those who have come 
from other sections of the world and 
now reside there, partake of the in- 
fluence of that ]«oad country. Their 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feelings accord with the breadth of 
the acres in that great, wide territory 
of ours, and their deep and generous 
natures resemble the gorges of the 
grand old Colorado. We live in per- 
fect harmony with the people of Ari- 
zona who are not of the religious faith 
of the Latter-day Saints. 

It was my privilege recently to read 
a brief history of the territory, and 
of the settlement of that country, com- 
piled by the Historians' Society, the 
"Pioneers of Arizona." In every part 
of the history that mentions the es- 
tablishment of a settlement or mining 
camp, or any industry they give the 
"Mormon" people due credit, and 
speak of them in the highest terms, 
which I of course, know that they de- 
serve. We do not always get this re- 
cognition, but as a rule, this people, 
from the governor down, are friendly, 
broad-minded, liberal and generous to 
us. I desire to have the people of 
Utah know that Arizona is only second 
to Utah in population, resources, sur- 
roundings, and environments. Its peo- 
ple are in every way the equal of those 
in this grand old state of Utah. 

The St. Joseph stake of Zion is in- 
creasing. Only recently it was my 
privilege to organize a ward in the 
district of country above the canal 
system, in the Artesian belt, and the 
quotation came to my mind then, from 
the Prophet Isaiah, where he said that 
"water should spring out of the earth, 
and the desert should blossom as the 
rose." And here, out among the cac- 
tus, the mesquite, the lizards, and the 
dry sandy soil, where our brethren 
h£ve driven down iron pipes in the 
earth, the artesian water comes pure 
and sparkling, bubbling and pouring 
up to the surface; and now we have 
organized a strong ward there. Just 
before I left home, I went a short dis- 
tance from this settlement to another 
one, by the name of Artesia, where 
we organized a branch and coupled it 
on to the ward that I have spoken of. 
A few years ago some colonizers from 
the east had come in and taken up 
this land, driven pipes and made 
wells, and endeavored to build a town 



or a village, but they couldn't do it. 
It takes "Mormons" to subdue the 
desert, the unity and co-operation of 
"Mormon" people. It seems to me that 
they are the only people that could 
ever have subdued this great inter- 
mountain desert. In this effort of our 
friends, they failed; some of them 
fought and killed each other, and the 
survivors became disgusted and sold 
out their holdings to our people. It 
was my privilege to go and assist them 
and fix up their affairs. We formed a 
little branch of the Church there, and 
they gave five acres of ground to build 
a meetinghouse on, and another of our 
Gentile friends offered five acres more, 
which we did not need. We expect to 
subdue that land, and we are producing 
now nearly everything that is neces- 
sary for the people. We have ai valley 
of about forty to fifty miles in length, 
through which the Gila river flows. 
That is a river heading out in Colorado 
and New Mexico, and continuing in its 
course till it empties into the Colorado 
on the borders of California. We have 
been using the land there for raising 
alfalfa, and other crops that are easy 
to take care of, but we are endeavoring 
now to start fruit raising. It was my 
pleas ure before leaving home to trim 
600 trees upon my own place, besides 
farming, attending to my garden, and 
fixing up everything so that I could 
leave for a short time. When we left 
alfalfa was nearly in blossom, trees 
were in foliage, and the country was 
covered with a beautiful carpet of 
green, livened up here and there by 
patches of beautiful flowers, with the 
cacti and poppies on the side hills; 
everything wa s lovely, -beautiful and 
thrifty. We have had a wet season, 
plenty of moisture, and grass and ev- 
erything in the fields is in a very for- 
ward condition. We have suffered 
somewhat from floods washing out 
dams, but we are learning how to build 
new ones better. 

This, we might say, i s the temporal 
side of affairs, but I attribute the suc- 
cess of the "Mormon" people, in this 
and other sections of the country, to 
their obedience to the Gospel of Jesus 



ELDER ANDREW KIMBALL.

Christ. I have listened to arguments 
of sectarians, and others who! have en- 
deavored to draw people together and 
co-operate to build up communities, but 
I have said to them, and would state 
it to all the world, they can never suc- 
ceed in co-operation, subdue the desert 
and build up homes therein, except by 
the principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the fellowship that comes 
in love for that Gospel. It can only be 
done on principles of righteousness, 
submission and obedience, by subduing 
ourselves, and bringing ourselves into 
subjection to the laws of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

Our people are united. They have 
put themselves in order, and have en- 
deavored to obey the laws of the Gospel. 
This is particularly true of our High 
Councilors and Bishops; they are pro- 
gressive, noble men, looking after the 
interests of the various wards, branches 
and organizations among the people 
over whom they are presiding, and we 
are just like one great family of nearly 
four thousand people. I feel like I 
could put my arms around them and 
love them all; and I strongly think that 
they love me. If I did not feel that I 
had their love and their confidence, I 
would want to move away from Ari- 
zona. 

We are united and in harmony in 
striving to build up, in that part of the 
world, the kingdom of God. We sustain 
not only each other but also our 
Prophet and President, Joseph F. 
Smith, and the Apostles of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. We sustain the presi- 
dencies of missions by sending our El- 
ders to them to preach the Gospel. I 
have brought with me from that coun- 
try on this trip 20 boys and girls who 
have come up to the Temple, and 
the boys are going on missions. I 
never saw such happy responses to 
missionary calls in my life, and for 
twelve and a half years I presided 
over what is now the Middle States 
mission. The Presidency of the Church 
called upon our stake for ten mission- 
aries, and in almost less time than it 
took to get an exchange of mail there 
were 14 who responded. In nearly all 



instances the call had been answered 
not alone by letters, but the boys have 
come and answered in person, and they 
are here ready to go anywhere that the 
Priesthood of God desires them. That 
is the kind of response that I love to 
witness. I say, God bless the youth 
of Zion. I am not discouraged in the 
boys and girls of this Church, for I 
have found that there is the spirit of 
patriotism and the love of the Gospel 
in them. They may not be doing just 
as well as some older members; they 
may have fallen into some "foolish 
habits, which we could possibly ex- 
cuse under some circumstances; but I 
tell you there is determination to do 
their duty when they are willing to 
drop everything, leave their young 
wives, their mothers, fathers, brothers 
and sisters, property interests and eve- 
rything that is dear to them, not know- 
ing what is ahead of them, taking their 
lives in their hands, and going to the 
different nations of the earth to preach 
the Gospel. That is the kind of people 
we have in the Church down in Ari- 
zona. The climate there is warm; 
we have genial sunshine, and that has 
some effect upon the people. They are 
warm hearted, generous, good, and 
faithful. I am willing that my lot 
should continue to be cast with the 
people of Arizona, and I am willing 
that my bones should be buried there. 
I say God bless them, and bless you 
all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SOLOMON HALE. 

My brothers and sisters: I am afraid 
that you may not be able to hear me, 
for since I have reached the city of 
the Saints, I have been suffering with 
a very severe cold on my lungs; but I 
am pleased to make a few remarks 
and bear my testimony to the Gospel. 
It nvould be working a hardship upon 
me if I were to talk very long, but it 
is an easy matter for me to bear my 
testimony to the truth of the work. 
It has been 67 years since I became 
a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. When I 
was in my youth I was acquainted with 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



74 

the Prophet Joseph Smith, and I was 
acquainted with his wife and family. 
I was also acquainted with the Patri- 
arch, Hyrum, but not so intimately 
with him as I was with the Prophet 
Joseph. Since then it has been my 
happy lot to have been closely asso- 
ciated and personally acquainted with 
every one of the Presidents of the 
Church, from the time that the Prophet 
was martyred in Carthage jail up toi 
the uresent. I knew Joseph F. Smith 
in Nauvoo, and his brother, the Patri- 
arch, John. I have been acquainted 
with them and know their worth, their 
integrity, their faithfulness, and I pray 
God to bless them. He has guarded and 
directed them. Now we have among 
the leaders in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints two more 
of the Smith family. We had, in my 
youth, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
the Patriarch Hyrum Smith. Now the 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator of th<> 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is Joseph F. Smith, and John 
Smith is the presiding Patriarch of the 
Church. I feel well in the Gospel. I 
bear my testimony to you, my brothers 
and sisters, in~ humility, that I know 
the work of God is true. From the 
early days of my youth I have always 
sustained the work. God knows my 
heart, He knows that I never betrayed 
the Prophet or people of God. I have 
known them, I have prayed for them. 
I have traveled with President Young 
thousands of miles. I know his worth. 
I know the worth of these two Kim- 
ball brothers here, and their father, 
Heber C. Kimball. I know that he 
was a man of God and a Prophet of 
God, as much as any one ever raised 
up in this dispensation of the fullness 
of times. May God bless and help us 
to be faithful and true to one another, 
be true to the Priesthood, true to God 
our Eternal Father, that we may claim 
every blessing He has in store ror us 
as faithful sons and daughters, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

In standing before the Latter-day 
Saints this afternoon, I desire to say 
those things that are timely, and to 
speak under the influence of the Holy 
Spirit. Notwithstanding the serious- 
ness of the occasion, having met as a 
part of the great Annual Conference, 
we need not pull long faces and put on 
an air of self righteousness, thinking 
it indicates faith and is more pleasing 
to the Lord. The Lord has said, "Cease 
from your light speeches, and excess of 
laughter," but He surely is pleased 
with pleasant countenances and a hap- 
py people, although wit and humor, 
may be out of place in houses of wor- 
ship. I read somewhere the follow- 
ing: "Many persons who never had 
a bright idea in their heads, or a gen- 
erous sentiment in their hearts, assum- 
ing an air of owlish wisdom, affect to 
disdain wit and humor, having never 
heard of the great truth enunciated by 
Charles Lamb: 'A laugh is worth a 
hundred groans in any market.' The 
idea is propagated that mutual dry- 
ness is indicative of wisdom." I re- 
alize that my reputation for wisdom 
has been greatly injured by repeating 
jokes in my public utterances, and 
that, because of my calling in the min- 
istry, I should, in the estimation of 
some people, be as solemn as an owl. 

It seems to be the destiny of the chil- 
dren of men to suffer sickness, sorrow, 
pain and poverty, and to die. With 
our most perfect organization, Priest- 
hood and authority, we still have trou- 
bles, and skeletons in our closets. It 
is considered a good thing to look wise, 
especially when not over burdened with 
information. 

It is my good fortune to be acquaint- 
ed with some of the unpleasant feat- 
ures of Arizona. My brother Andrew, 
who has just preceded me, as one of 
the speakers, has expatiated on the 
sunshine and splendor of Arizona to so 
great an extent that I am fearful the 
good people of Utah will stampede and 
wend their way southward to that hap- 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL.

py land. My brother comes from a 
sunshiny clime, and to an Arizonan 
there are no clouds; the truth is, they 
don't know ' when they are in trouble. 
He has recited all the good things; he 
is an optimist. 

Allow me to relate an experience in 
that far distant land. At a Stake 
Quarterly Conference, held at Thatcher, 
we were caught in a windstorm when 
the sun was shining. My ears, mouth, 
and eyes and clothing were loaded 
with sand, and yet my brother said, 
"I never saw anything like it before." 
I desire to make a statement here in 
explanation of something that I said 
in the conference meeting on Friday. 

I have learned that some of the 
greatest miracles and most marvelous 
events have happened to the servants 
of God when they were placed in jail 
for righteousness sake. Some of the 
greatest revelations that God has ever 
given in this age and dispensation were 
given to the Prophet of God when he 
was in jail, in trouble and difficulty. 
During his time of sorrow and loneli- 
ness, God, the Father, came to him, by 
His Spirit, and he received marvelous 
revelations. I read in the Bible about 
Peter being imprisoned, and an angel of 
God. coming to his rescue. He was 
taken through the great iron gates, and 
escaped when his enemies were desir- 
ous of taking his life. I read also about 
the prophets of God in the days of the 
Book of Mormon history. Prisons were 
broken down, and manifestations of 
God were made apparent to the ser- 
vants of the Most High. An incident 
happened in the Southern States mis- 
sion, which I will relate. It trans- 
pired in the days of President John 
Morgan, and occurred at a time when 
the State of Tennessee passed a law 
that any man who advocated or 
preached polygamy was to be arrest- 
ed and punished. Enemies to the El- 
ders entrapped the brethren into a dis- 
cussion on this most unpopular sub- 
ject, and the Elders defended the prin- 
ciple from a Biblical standpoint. A 



complaint was filed, and the Elders 
were arrested. They were short of 
room inside the jail, so the brethren, 
two in number, were confined in two 
steel cages on the outside, near to 
each other. The imprisoned servants 
of the Lord were not orators or singers. 
The people far and near, hearing of 
Mormon Elders being under arrest, 
gathered to see these peculiar individ- 
uals. The brethren sang hymns and 
testified of the truth of the Gospel, 
etc. It is claimed they had congrega- 
tions of 300, and I have been told that 
the people had never heard such won- 
derful preaching and singing. The El- 
ders almost regretted receiving their 
freedom. So I am almost inclined to 
advocate putting our Elders in jail 
once in a while, when they are unable 
to get a hearing in any other way. 

I remember about the time I was re- 
leased from the Southern States Mis- 
sion, we had just commenced to preach 
in the cities of the South. Two of our 
Elders were arrested in Birmingham 
because they were preaching the 
Gospel Avithout purse or scrip. 
They were arrested and placed 
in prison for violating what 
was claimed to be a city ordinance. 
Friends came to their rescue and they 
were released. Had they remained for 
a short time, in my opinion it would 
have resulted in much good, although 
very unpleasant and hard on the El- 
ders. 

I want to ask in all soberness, if you 
think this Gospel that has been reveal- 
ed by the Lord through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith can be advocated and 
preached among the children of men 
without serious consequences? I tell you 
if our Elders go out and advocate 
the truth of this work, it will bring up- 
on them persecution, and whippings. 
It may not be the better element who 
will do that, they never have whipped 
our Elders; it has generally been the 
same class as those who are killing the 
negroes in the South; but the people 
•winked at it. I was almost a witness

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



to the killing of our Elders in Ten- 
nessee, on Cane Creek, and I know 
something about the spirit of mobo- 
cracy. 

Now I will read to you to show that 
there will come sorrows to the Latter- 
day Saints, trials, and tests. Every 
man in this Church will be tested to 
the core; they will be proven as Abra- 
ham was proven, and when the Lord is 
satisfied that you love Him and will 
keep His commandments, then He will 
come to your rescue. Somebody has 
said that Heber C. Kimball was a 
Prophet, and I am going to prove it. 
He is my father, and I tell you I am 
glad I am his son. I have the copy 
of a discourse he delivered in 1867, one 
year before his death. There were no 
such buildings here then as this; it 
was in the old tabernacle. 

"President Kimball opened by stat- 
ing that there were many within hear- 
ing who had often wished that they 
had been associated with the Prophet 
Joseph. 'You imagine,' said he, 'that 
you would have stood by him when 
persecution raged, and he was assailed 
by foes within and without. You 
would have defended him, and been 
true to him in the midst of every trial. 
You think you would have been delight- 
ed to have shown your integrity in 
the das's of mobs and traitors. Let me 
say to you, that many of you will see 
the time when you will have all the 
trouble, trial and persecution that you 
can stand, and plenty of opportunities 
to show that you are true to God and 
His work. This Church has before it 
many close places, through which it 
will have to pass before the worn: of 
God is crowned with victory. To meet 
the difficulties that are coming [see, 
they are- to come, they are not behind 
you, but they are coming] it will be 
necessary for you to have a knowledge 
of the truth of 'this work for yourselves: 
the difficulties will be of such a char- 
acter that the man or woman who r'oes 
not possess this personal knowledge or 
witness will fall. If you have not 
got the testimony, live right, and call 
upon the Lord and cease not until you 
obtain it. If you do not you will not 
stand. That is the word of God to you 
people. Remember these sayings, for 
many of you will live to see them ful- 
filled. The time will come when no 
man nor woman will be able to en- 
dure on borrowed light. Each will have 



to be guided by the light within him- 
self. If you do not have it how can 
you stand? Do you believe it' How 
is it now? You have the First Pres 
idency, from whom you can get coun- 
sel to guide you, and you rely on them 
The time will come when they will not 
be with you. Why? Because they will 
have to flee and hide up to keep out 
of the hands of their enemies. You 
have the Twelve now. You will 
not always have them, for they, too 
will be hunted and will have to keep 
out of the way of their enemies. You 
have other men to whom you look for 
counsel and advice. Many of them will 
not be amongst you, for the same rea- 
son. You will be left to the light with- 
in yourselves. If you don't have it, 
you will not stand. Therefore, seek for 
the testimony of Jesus, and cleave to 
it, that when the trying time comes 
you may not stumble and fall." 

I ask you, Latter-day Saints who are 
here, Have you lived long enough to 
see that prophecy fulfilled. There is not 
a man, woman or child that has got 
the least particle of intelligence but 
knows that has been literally fulfilled. 
The time came when we did not have 
the First Presidency, neither did we 
have the Twelve, they had to flee for 
safety, every one of them; and the peo- 
ple were left to themselves. ♦ 

In the course of his remarks on the 
occasion in point, he several times said: 
"You will have all the persecution you 
want, and more, too, and all the oppor- 
tunities to show your integrity to God 
and the truth that you could desire." 

I will quote to you another prophecy. 
In 1856, a little group of friends con- 
vened in the Endowment House, and 
were engaged in a conversation on the 
isolated condition of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

"Y"es," said Brother Heber, by 
which name he was so familiarly 
known, "we think we are secure here 
in the chambers of the everlasting hills, 
where we can close those few doors of 
the canyons against mobs and perse- 
cutors, the wicked and the vile who 
have always beset us with violence and 
robbery; but I want to say to you, my 
brethren, the time is coming when we 
will be mixed up in these now peace-

ful valleys to that extent that it will 
be difficult to tell the face of a Saint 
from the face of an enemy to the peo- 
ple of God. Then, brethren, look out 
for the great sieve, for there will be a 
great sifting time, and many will fall, 
for I say unto you, there is a' test, a 
TEST, a TEST, coming, and who will 
be able to stand?" 

My mother has told me that the last 
time father took a walk down Main 
Street, after he was stricken with 
paralysis, he returned with difficulty 
back to his home, the residence which 
still stands on the hill, and he said to 
her, "OH, THE TEST, THE TEST, 
THE TEST, who will be able to 
stand?" Mother said, "What is the 
test?" He replied, "I don't know, but 
it is only those that know that Jesus 
is the Christ that can stand." 

Now, brethren and sisters, it is time 
for hard thinking. This is not Jo- 
seph Smith's church, nor Brigham 
Young's church; they never made any 
such a claim. Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God, and the people made 
him President of the Church. This is 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. It is not President Jo- 
seph F. Smith's church, nor the Twelve 
Apostles' church. They are the ser- 
vants of the people; they are men 
called of God, just as our Elders are 
called to fill missions. They are or- 
dained by divine authority, and have 
received these great appointments in 
the Apostleship and in the Presidency 
of the Church; but it is not their 
church. As I have said, it is the 
Church of Jesus Christ; each of us 
has individual work in it. If the 
Latter-day Saints do not know that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that this is His 
Church, I tell you, in the name of the 
Lord, you will not stand, you will be 
among the number that will fall. I 
remember hearing about a saying of 
President Young to a brother who was 
terribly tried. The case came before 
the High Council, and the council had 
decided against the man. You know it 
happens sometimes, when the decision 
is not in your favor, you feel dis- 
gruntled; and some leave the Church 
because of the actions of men; they 



feel they have been dealt with unjust- 
ly. Brother Brigham, on the occasion 
referred to, said to the brother in sar- 
casm, "Now apostatize and go to hell." 
And the brother ejaculated, "I won't 
do it; this is just as much my church 
as it is yours, and I am going to stay 
with it." Well, that is Mormonism; 
it is our Church, as long as we keep 
the comandments of God; and we can 
be put out of it only through aposta- 
sy, rebellion, or criminal actions. Now 
let us stay with it, and, like my brother 
Andrew, always tell good things about 
Zion and let other things alone. The 
Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN. 

I have felt very much impressed, my 
brethren and sisters, in listening to the 
remarks that have been made by our 
brethren this afternoon. I rejoiced 
greatly in hearing the testimony of 
Brother Solomon Hale, who,' as we 
have heard, was well acauainted with 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. He has been 
quite closely associated with the breth- 
ren who have occupied positions of 
trust and importance in the Church of 
Latter-day Saints, from that time to 
the present. He has borne a very earn-, 
est and faithful testimony concerning 
the character and mission of the men 
who have occupied these presiding po- 
sitions. More especially in regard to 
the character of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, President Brigham Young, and 
President Heber C. Kimball. No doubt 
we have all been impressed with the 
Words that have been read in our hear- 
ing by President J. G. Kimball, that 
were spoken a long time ago, by his 
father, President Heber C. Kimball. As 
has been intimated, we are all wit. 
nesses, to a greater or less degree, of 
the fulfillment of the inspired words 
that were uttered by President Heber 
C. Kimball so many years ago. I have 
also been impressed with the disposi- 
tion manifest by all of the brethren to 
bear testimony to the mission of the 
Prophet Joseph. They all testify tha\ 
he was inspired by our Father in hea\- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



en, and that he was a Prophet of the 
Lord. I have wondered if there is not 
a feeling- sometimes on the part 01 
those who are not particularly at., 
quainted with the work of the Latter- 
day Saints, when they hear testimony 
so frequently that prophets and apos- 
tles are in the church; if we are not 
given more or less to fanaticism. No 
such testimonies are ever heard in other 
churches. We are the only people, prac- 
tically, who believe in living Prophets, 
and it is evident from the words that 
are spoken, and from the testimonies 
that are so frequently delivered, tha; 
we are very earnest believers in 
the necessity of prophets to receive tht 
word of the Lord today. I thought I 
would like to read a few words tha^ 
were uttered by the Redeemer of the 
world, in the great sermon upon th« 
mount, wherein He says: 

"Beware of false prophets which 
come to you in sheep's cloth- 
ing, but inwardly they are raven- 
ing wolves. Ye shall know them 
by their fruits. Do men gather grapes 
of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so. 
every good tree bringeth forth good 
fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth 
evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring 
forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt 
tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree 
that brigeth not forth good fruit is 
hewn down and cast into the fire, 
Wherefore, by their fruits ye shah 
know them. 

I take it, that when the Redeemer of 
the World, in His teaching to the chil- 
dren of men, gave warning against 
false prophets, He indicated by thost 
very words, that there ought to be 
among men true prophets, else He 
would have said, Beware of prophets. 
There are many in the world today 
who no doubt regret that the Redeem- 
er did not say to the people, Beware of 
prophets. But there is no such declara- 
tion or warning; but there is a warn- 
ing that we should beware of false 
prophets, and that we should judge by 
their fruits the men who claim and 
profess to be prophets of the Lord. 
"By their fruits ye shall know them." 
My brethren and sisters, w e ought to 
be exceedingly thankful to our Father 
in heaven, that this test can be ap- 



plied to those who have stood before 
the people as Prophets of the Lord h, 
these latter times. The test can be ap. 
plied in the manner that it has beer* 
applied, this afternoon by the reading 
of the prophecies delivered so long 
ago, showing the complete fulfillment of 
the predictions that have been made 
by the modern prophets. It is written 
in the Scriptures: 

"When a Prophet speaketh in the 
name of the Lord, if the thing follow 
not, nor come to pass, that is the thing 
which the Lord hath not spoken, but 
the Prophet hath spoken it presump- 
tously; thou shalt not be afraid of 
him." 

It is good logic to decide in our minds 
that if the things spoken by the 
mouth of a Prophet cometh to pass, 
then we shall know that he has not 
spoken presumptuously, but that he 
has spoken by the inspiration and di- 
rection of our Father in heaven. If we 
scan the prophecies that have been de- 
livered by those who have been raised 
up by divine appointment, in the age 
in which »we are living, in the ushering 
in of the great dispensation of the full- 
ness of times, we will discover that all 
along the line the predictions of the 
prophets, even those that have ap- 
peared in many instances almost im- 
possible of fulfillment, have been veri- 
fied. We have abundant evidence, not- 
withstanding the unbelief of the world, 
that Joseph Smith was a great Prophet. 
This evidence is found in the history 
that has been made by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 
inspiration of the Almighty has been 
abundantly poured out upon His ser- 
vants, and the future of the Saints has 
been foreseen by the gift and power of 
revelation. 

I would like to read another word or 
two bearing upon his subject, written 
by one of the ancient Apostles. We pro- 
fess in the age in which we live to be- 
lieve in the words of the old Prophets, 
to believe also in the predictions of the 
ancient Apostles. If we believe in their 
predictions, if we believe in the doc- 
trines that they have enunciated, then 
we ought to be believers in divine in- 
spiration, we ought to be believers in 
present day Prophets, and present day

Apostles, for an inspired man of God 
has made this declaration: "And God 
hath set some in the Church, first Apos- 
tles, scondarily, Prophets, thirdly teach- 
ers, after that miracles, then gifts of 
healing, helps, governments, diversi- 
ties of tongues. Are all Apostles? Are 
all prophets? Are all teachers? Are 
all workers of miracles?" No, all men 
are not Apostles; all men are not 
Prophets; all are not workers of mir- 
acles, but God hath set all of these in 
His Church, and He has made the 
■declaration that "the eye cannot say 
to the hand, I have no need of thee, 
nor again the head to the feet, I have 
no need of you." The inspired "writer 
compares the officers in the Church of 
Christ, with the members of the body, 
and positively makes the declaration, 
in the comparison, that all the officers 
are necessary. The Church without 
Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, etc., 
would be deformed like the body with- 
out the head, or without an eye, or 
without a hand. They are all essential, 
and necessary, they have all been' plac- 
ed in the Church by our Father in 
heaven; so declares the Apostle, and so 
say the Latter-day Saints. The Apos- 
tle Paul further declares in this same 
epistle, "If any man think himself to 
be a prophet, or spiritual, let him ac- 
knowledge that the things that I write 
unto you are the commandments of the 
Lord." O ye believers in the Scrip- 
tures of divine truth, if ye think ye 
are spiritually minded, if ye think ye 
are Prophets, acknowledge, saith one 
who was inspired, that the things 
which he wrote pertaining to the organ- 
ization of the Church are the revela- 
tions of the Lord. They are not the 
commandments of men. They have not 
been gotten up by the education or cun- 
ning of men. They are great and nec- 
essary doctrines that have been reveal- 
ed. They are true, and without them 
there can be no Church of God. Truth 
will work its way in the world, and 
cannot be staid. Troubles may come, 
disappointments may come, anxieties 
may overtake us, but let us not forget 
that the Lord our God has revealed the 
truth of the Everlasting Gospel. Let 
"s not forget that He has planted this 



organization by His own almighty pow- 
er, and He has said that every hand 
that is lifted against it shall perish. 
We know not how. We stand amazed 
at the promises that have been made 
•by our Father in heaven, but we know 
within our souls, thank God, that the 
promises will be fulfilled, and we have 
but to keep our eyes upon the mark of 
our high calling in Christ Jesus our 
Lord. Refrain from evils; be upright 
in conduct. Watch the authority that 
has been given, that presides over the 
Holy Priesthood, and be true to that 
authority, and all will be well. This 
is "Mormonism," and it is the truth 
of God. It is not a myth, it is as God 
has revealed it. I gladly bear this tes- 
timony to you, my brethren and sisters, 
in the name of my Redeemer, even sq. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

My brethren and sisters, as the last 
meting of this conference is drawing 
to a close, I desire to congratulate you 
who have assembled in having been 
present at the largest attended general 
conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Each 
year our numbers seem to increase con- 
siderably, and while the tabernacle and 
this building are full, and the Temple 
block grounds are crowded, the increase 
is so great that there is now no place 
in this city large enough to hold the 
representatives of Zion, who came to 
conference. 

We will now present the General Au- 
thorities of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints for your vote, in 
this final meeting. I desire to say that 
we hope every man and woman who 
are members of the Church, in good 
standing, will vote according to their 
feelings, whether for or against the au- 
thorities of the Church; and we ex- 
pect that people who are not in good 
standing, or not members of the Church 
shall refrain from voting. 

It becomes my painful duty, and it 
fills my heart with sorrow, to announce 
to you that, since our last general con- 
ference, there have occurred three va- 



\

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



cancies in the quorum of the Twelve. 
Elder Marriner W. Merrill passed from 
this life on February 6th, 1906. We re- 
ceived from Elders John W. Taylor and 
Mathias F. Cowley their written resig- 
nations, dated October 28th, 1905, of 
their positions as members of the Quo- 
rum of the Twelve, which were accept- 
ed by the Twelve and the First Presi- 
dency of the Church. These vacancies 
have been filled, as directed by the 
Spirit of the Lord through His servant, 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

Another announcement that also 
causes sorrow is, that President Chris- 
tian D. Fjeldsted departed this life on 
December 23rd, 1905, causing a vacancy 
in the First Council of Seventy, that 
has been filled as the other vacancies 
were. 

Elder Smith then presented the names 
of the general authorities, the full list 
of whom will be found in the report of 
proceedings in the Tabernacle. The 
brethren named were sustained by 
unanimous vote of the congregation. 

Now that we are ready to go from 
this last meeting, I trust the spirit of 
this conference may be in the soul of 
every Latter-day Saint; that our tes- 
timonies may have been strengthened 
by meeting together; that we may re- 
turn to our homes and feel to be more 
faithful, more devoted to the service 
of our Father, in laboring to do good to 
all His children, wherever they may be 
on the earth; and that we may be in- 
deed Latter-day Saints, that we may 
be worthy of membership in the Church 
of Christ, that day by day our light 
may so shine that men, seeing our 
good works, may glorify our Father 
who is in heaven, which is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "But in 
the last days it shall come to pass." 

Benediction by Elder Horace Cum- 
mings. 



OUTDOR MEETIN(j. 

A thousand of the people who 
were unable to gain admittance 
either to the Tabernacle or the 



Assembly Hall, listened to re- 
marks of prominent Elders on the 
east side of the Bureau of Information 
building. Elder Benjamin Goddard pre- 
sided over the services, and seated with 
him, in chairs that had been placed u> 
on the lawn, were President William 
H. Smart of Wasatch stake, Nephi 
Pratt, president of the Northwestern 
States mission; President Hugh J. Can- 
non of Liberty stake; Elder Joseph E. 
Robinson, president of the California 
mission, and President Thomas E. Bas-. 
sett of Fremont stake, who addressed 
the congregation in the order named. 

A pleasing feature of the meeting was 
the music rendered, under the leader- 
ship of Prof. Charles Kent. He sang 
as a solo "I Know that My Redeemer 
Liveth," and the numbers sang by the 
congregation were 'We Thank Thee, 
O God, for a Prophet," "The Spirit of 
God Like a Fire is Burning," and "Oh 
ye Mountains High." The opening 
prayer was by Elder Charles S. Mar- 
tin, and Elder H. J. Foulger, Sr., pro- 
nounced the benediction. 



Services commenced at 2:15 p. m. 

ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 

(President of Wasatch Stake.) 

Elder William H. Smart said that the 
present gathering reminded him forci- 
bly of meetings held by Elders in the 
missionary field. It was gratifying to 
see such an outpouring of people at 
conference, and to witness the interest 
and enthusiasm manifested. The splen- 
did reports that had been made of tht 
rapid spread of the latter-day worx 
throughout the world, should inspirt 
the hearts of young Latter-day Saints 
and convince them that the work is 
indeed true. The speaker counseled 
youthful members of the Church to be. 
pure and chaste in their lives, and not 
to wander away from the path followed 
by their fathers and mothers. The 
great things of the future should be 
prepared for, and none should be lifted 
up in pride nor in any way be led from 
the ways of meekness and humility- 



OUTDOOR 

The geatest men of all ages, said the 
speaker, have been men that were meek 
and more or less sacrificing in their 
lives. Abraham and the brother of 
Jared were referred to as noted ex- 
amples of the type whose singleness of 
purpose and devotion to duty had 
brought to them the blessings of heav- 
en. 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission. ) 

Elder Nephi Pratt said that there 
are more people now within the Temple 
block than were living in Utah at the 
time of the laying of the cornerstone ot 
the Temple, that magnificent monu- 
ment of the faith and labors of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. The "Mormon" people, 
worship the true and living God, not 
that something called a "Univer- 
sal Force," adored by an eminent 
American divine and believed in more 
or less by the people of Christendom. 
Such an imaginary being would be in- 
carnate in the roar of the tempest and 
in the earthquake's devastating shock. 
Our God and Father, he said, is a per- 
sonality, that divine being whose feet 
were washed and who partook of food 
in the tent of Abraham, who visited 
Jacob and Moses; whose finger of 
flesh wrote the ten commandments 
upon a tablet of stone, and whose voice 
proclaims His will to the ends of the 
earth. The Latter-day Saints, con- 
tinued Elder Pratt, came to an arid 
and desolate region, and in privation 
laid the foundations of their present 
affluence. The young men were urged 
upon by the speaker to marry, and aot 
become the "ugliest thing on two leg.^, 
a bachelor." He advised the Saints 
to so live that prisons, asylums and 
almshouses would be unnecessary ?or 
them. 

ELDER HUGH J. CANNON. 

(President of Liberty Stake.) 

Elder Hugh J. Cannon said that the 
Latter-day Saints were not ashamed of 
their religion, but invited an investiga- 
tion of its principles and its fruits. 



MEETING. gl 

They desired to be judged, not from a 
standard of perfection, but to be aver- 
aged with the best and highest types 
of their fellowmen. The world did not 
seem, he said, to consider whether 
"Mormons" are as good as anybody 
else, but expected them to be much 
better. The young people of the Church 
have now more opportunities for study- 
ing the philosophy of their religion than 
has been the case in the past, and the 
majority of them are not letting these 
opportunities slip by without taking 
advantage of them. Tet very few, he 
thought, studied the grand subject suf- 
ficiently. It is not sufficient to know 
that God has restored the Gospel of 
Christ. The plan of salvation must ap- 
peal to the soul and control the actions 
of men amid all the temptations of 
life. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

Elder Joseph E. Robinson said that 
the Gospel is full of philosophy and will 
bear the closest investigation. It ap- 
peals to the heart as well as to the 
reason . True religion underlies all that 
pertains to its existence. All scientific 
achievement is the result of applied 
faith. The Gospel of repentance is che 
principle of progression in all the af- 
fairs of life. It leads from the doing 
of things in a wrong way to better 
methods, and thus perfection must 
eventually come. The speaker detailed 
a conversation with a gentleman of the 
Episcopalian persuasion, who thought 
that his religion was more broad and 
liberal and respectable than that of 
"Mormonism." Elder Robinson ex- 
plained that the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints is broad, for it reaches every 
member of the human family, whether 
living or dead. If respectability meant 
the exclusion of all but the well dressed 
and high-born, he admitted that "Mor- 
monism" was not respectable. In con- 
clusion, Elder Robinson advised the 
Latter-day Saints to live in such a 
manner as to bring no disrepute upon 
themselves or upon their Church.

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 

(President of Fremont Stake.) 

Elder Thomas E. Bassett was the 
closing- speaker. He felt grateful, he 
said, for the environment of good men 
and good women in this Church. He 
had been nurtured in the precepts of 
the Gospel of Christ, had witnessed 
many of the hand-dealings of God and 
knew beyond a doubt that "Mormon- 
ism" is true. The prophecy uttered by 
the, Prophet Joseph Smith that the 
Saints should become a mighty people 
in the midst of the Rocky Mountains 
had been verily fulfilled, as witnessed 
by the hundreds of thousands of people 
dwelling in these regions. We are not 
responsible for the setting up of this 
work, the speaker said, neither can we 
stop its progress. It is the work of 
God and never will be overthrown. Men 
must live according to the precepts of 
the Gospel if they will retain a testi- 
mony of its truth. Corruption in life 
will drive out the light, and cause the 
soul to wander in darkness. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

Prest. Joseph F. Smith called the 
meeting to order.

the Lord all ye Nations." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Nephi 
L. Morris. 

The choir sang the anthem. "Worthy 
is the Lamb that was Slain." 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Importance of observing God's law con- 
cerning the Sabbath day.— The day 
should not be desecrated by unbecoming 
conduct.— Abundant opportunities pro- 
vided for recreation in other days. — 
Municipal laws, and personal appeal 
should influence reverence for the Sab- 
bath. 

My brethren and sisters, it is a pleas- 
ure to me to have the opportunity of 
being in attendance upon this confer- 
ence, listening to the words that have 
been spoken by the Brethren whose 



privilege it has been to speak, and par- 
taking of the spirit that has character- 
ized the meetings thus far. I desire 
that you will give me the aid of your 
faith and prayers, that I may be en- 
abled to discharge the duty ihat has 
fallen to my lot in that manner that 
shall result in our mutual good, and 
that may awaken in our minds a deter- 
mination to more fully ana devotedly 
discharge the sacred obligations into 
which we have entered connected with 
the work the Lord has committed to 
our care at this time. As I was sit- 
ting here the thought entered my mind 
that I would like to ieud to the con- 
gregation a portion of one of the reve- 
lations. It is contained in Section 
59 of the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, and is a revelation given through 
Joseph the Seer, m Zion, Jackson coun- 
ty, Missouri, Aug. 7, 1831. 

"Behold, blessed, saitn the Lord, are 
they who have come up unto this land 
with an eye single to my glory, accord- 
ing to my commandments; 

"For them that live shall inherit the 
earth, and them that die shall rest from 
all their labors, and their works shall 
follow them, and they snail receive a 
crown in the mansions of my Father, 
which I have prepared for them; 

"Yea, blessed are they wnose feet 
stand upon the land of Zion, who have 
obeyed my Gospel, for they shall receive 
for their reward the good things of tnb 
earth; and it shall bring forth in its 
strength; 

"And they shall also be crowned with 
blessings from above, yea, and with 
commandments not a few; and with 
revelations in their time: they that are 
faithful and diligent before me. 

"Wherefore I give unto them a com- 
mandment, saying thus: Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart, with all thy might, mind, and 
strength; and in the name of Jesus 
Christ thou shalt serve him. 

"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither 
commit adultery, nor kill, nor do any- 
thing like unto it. 

"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God 
in all things. 

"Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the 
Lord thy God in righteousness, even 
that of a broken heart and a contrite 
spirit. 

"And that thou mayest more fully 
keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer 
and offer up thy sacraments upon my 
holy day; 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH.

"For verily this is a day appointed 
unto you to rest trom your labors, and 
to pay thy devotions unto tne Most 

High: 

"Nevertheless thy vows shall be of- 
fered up in righteousness on all days 
and at all times; 

"But remember that on tnis the Lord's 
day, thou shait offer thine oblations 
and' thy sacraments unto the Most 
High, confessing thy sins unto thy 
brethren, and before the Lord." 

To my mind, the principles contained 
in this revelation, given to the Church- 
in 1831, are worthy of our consideration 
today, and the suggestions therein af- 
fecting our conduct should receive our 
thoughtful observance. In the midst 
of the cares and responsibilities that 
attach to us, in the struggle we have 
to make to secure for ourselves tem- 
poral blessings, as well as to minister 
in the performance of spiritual labors, 
sometimes we are not as mindful of 
these obligations as we should be. 
Without thought we occasionally drift 
into a disregard of the Sabbath day. 
We look upon it with a degree of laxity, 
not in keeping with the commandment 
concerning it as given unto us by our 
Heavenly Father. I believe that if 
there is any condemnation that applies 
most specifically to the Latter-day 
Saints for the neglect of duty, it is 
that some have turned this sacred day 
too much into a day of visiting and 
pleasure. We are not as thoughtful 
as we should be of its observance, and 
of the legitimate duties connected with 
this great day of rest instituted by 
our Father in heaven in His covenant 
with His children in former days, and 
renewed unto us in the wonderful 
trust that each one that has come to 
trust that each one that has came to 
attend this great conference will be 
impressed with the importance of oui 
Father's purpose in thus setting the 
Sabbath day apart again in our day, 
through the revelations of His will, 
and that, so far as we have influence 
and power with those placed under our 
watchcare, we shall impress upon their 
minds also that the day should be ob- 
served more sacredly and thoughtfully 
than it has been in the past. It is 
true, many of us who have been away 



from home, ministering in preaching 
the Gospel, have possibly Jost our in- 
fluence, in a limited degree, upon our 
children in regard to these matters, and 
they may have drifted from us with 
the tide. In seeking, by our com- 
panionship and counsel, to check the 
tendency that has affected them, we 
sometimes And it difficult to impress 
them with our views, and with the sac- 
red regard in which we hold the in- 
junction given by the Almighty con- 
cerning this holy day. But I believe 
the effort should be made more care- 
fuly and thoroughly by every one of 
us, as fathers and mothers, as Elders 
in the Church, as presiding authorities 
in the branches and wards of Zion, 
and as ministers in every field, to im- 
press upon the minds of the Lord's cov- 
enant people that His love and bless- 
ings can only be obtained by the ob- 
servance of His holy will. 

Similar thoughts are awakened in my 
mind in reflecting upon other 
questions. Our Heavenly Father 
has been exceedingly generous to 
us in the line of the amusements we are 
privileged to enjoy. No people in the 
world have been more thoughtfully con- 
sidered in the matter of amusements, 
both for young and old. o."n theatricals, 
in dancing, in concerts, in visits to 
proper places of resort, and in other 
privileges of enjoyment, we have been 
generously dealt witn as a people, so 
that the exuberant spirits of youth 
may have legitimate exercise, and those 
who have reached riper years may be 
refreshes and have their minds relaxed 
from the cares and responsibilities of 
life. But our Father, while permitting 
these privileges, has laid upon us the 
requirement of sacredly regarding His 
holy day and discharging our obliga- 
tions in regard to it. Should conditions 
prevent us from being in attendance at 
Sabbath school, at the Sacrament meet- 
ing, or at the evening meeting, that 
day should not oe spent in visiting 
neighbors, in mingling with one an- 
other upon the streets, or in going to 
pleasure resorts. If it is impossible for 
us to attend places of sacred worship 
in public, we should seek to study th« 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Scriptures at home, and equip ourselves 
by communion with the Spirit, for the 
great work the good Master has set us 
to do. I believe that our condemna- 
tion will be great— fathers and moth- 
ers as well as children— if we disregard 
this sacred day and its obligations. 

It is not my intention to detain you, 
but I desire to impress upon the sons 
and daughters of Zion that no people 
has ever been dealt with more gener- 
ously than we have in opportunities af- 
forded for legitimate and proper amuse- 
ment. The Lord has sought to impress 
upon our minds a sacred regard of His 
holy day, and has also made it possible 
for us to, at other times, have amuse- 
ment along proper lines, and in proper 
companionship. Therefore it is improp- 
er and unrighteous for any to seek the 
companionship of the lewd and vicious, 
or mingle with the wicked in places of 
pleasure upon the Sabbath day. It is 
also wrong for us to participate in any 
of the great variety of agencies which 
men have established that tend to the 
moral overthrow and destruction of 
their fellows. I believe that the author- 
ities of every city, town and village 
within the United States should seek to 
cause the citizens to regard with more 
sacredness and respect the day .ie- 
signated by the Almighty as a day of 
rest. I believe that we to whom the 
revelation has come in the latter days 
in regard to the observance of the* Sab- 
bath, should be determined that His 
day must be held in reverence, respect 
and love. We should honor the men 
and women of every faith, creed, and 
condition that seek in fairness, mercy 
and love to prevent the turning of the 
Lord's day into a time for wrong doing 
that may result in the moral overthrow 
and destruction of human beings. The 
desire should be instilled into the minds 
of every man and woman to honor and 
esteem it, and to utilize it for the ac- 
complishment of their improvement in 
a knowledge of the divine will, and 
increasing their respect and reverence 
for our Heavenly Father. 

I ask you who are pongregated here, 
men who influence the views and ideas 
of communities, women whose hearts 



are attuned to the best interests of the 
human race, to see to it that the im- 
press of a sacred regard for the Lord's 
holy day shall be inculcated by you, 
both in word and action, so that the 
moral regulations given of the Almighty 
may be more thoroughly established 
among His great family. Remember 
the right and do it. Let this love of the 
principles of righteousness be imbued 
in the souls of our sons and daughter?, 
and then, though they drift from our 
control for a while, the time will come 
in the trials and experiences of iife 
when they will come back to their 
homes, with regrets for having disre- 
garded our instructions and the im- 
press we sought to make upon them. 

May we be true to every propositiou 
involved in the principles of our faith, 
and also in the good couched in the 
faith of every other living soul. May 
we be set and determined in our pur- 
pose that everything evil and wrong 
shall be met with an effort , upon our 
part to eradicate it and better the con- 
ditions of life. Let us point the way 
to the success that may come to men 
and women who shall do the will of 
their Father, blessing their fellows, and 
being just to every one. May the bless- 
ings of Heaven abound in your hearts 
and in your homes. May you love tie 
principles of righteousness. May vou 
honor the Lord's day. May the moral 
doctrines of the Gospel, given in the law 
of which I have spoken, including 
"Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not 
commit adultery," "Thou shalt not 
kill," and others like unto it, be among 
the guiding beacons of your lives. May 
the love of your country and its insti- 
tutions, and the maintenance of every 
principle of right and justice that guard 
the liberties of every human being, be 
exhibited in your every action; that 
the principles established for the bet- 
terment of the human race, that the lib- 
eralizing of mankind, and the preach- 
ing of the truth among them, may be 
sustained by you, without fear of the 
frowns of mankind, but in love of the 
right, in the principle of mercy, and in 
the justice that should be accorded to 
every human being.

God has spoken from the heavens. His 
truth has been declared among the 
children of men. The message of glad- 
ness has come and is to be heralded to 
the whole human race. Upon you, in 
connection with the others who have 
been warned, rests this responsibility. 
May wisdom, prudence, faith, undying 
courage and unyielding dievotion to 
principle govern your lives, that the 
truth may stand, and that you may 
nonor everything that is noble and true, 
is my prayer. Amen. 

The quartet. "Lead Kindly Light," 
was beautifully rendered by Sisters 
Larson, Owen, Jones and Jorgensen. 

ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 

Harmony in the Church— Spread of the 
Gospel— Seeds Sown in Time Will Bear 
Fruit in Eternity.— Individual Identity 
Immortal.— Godhead of Jesus Christ.— 
The Atonement— Faithfulness in Adver- 
sity as in Prosperity. 

This is a magnificent sight viewed 
from this upper stand. To see so many 
noble countenances upturned, expres- 
sive of devotion and faith and a de- 
sire to be instructed, places a person 
occpying this position in a state of 
anxiety, to some extent. I believe this 
has been felt by all our brethren who 
have stood up before the congregations 
during this conference to speak in 
the name of the Lord. We feel that a 
great responsibility rests upon us. The 
task might not be so great if we were 
In the habit of framing discourses to 
deliver to the public, and coming pre- 
pared not only with subjects but with 
words and phrases to deliver to the 
congregation, but you, my brethren 
and sisters, are aware that that is 
not one of the customs in this Church. 
We are required, as the servants of the 
Lord, to treasure up in our hearts con- 
tinually the words of eternal life, so 
that we may be prepared when called 
upon or when necessity requires, to 
speak that which the Lord shall in- 
spire on the occasion. 

I have greatly enjoyed the sessions 
of this conference, and the discourses 
that have been delivered, and the re- 
Ports that have been made. There 
has been present with, us a delightful 



spirit. We have enjoyed good fellow- 
ship and harmony. There has been 
no discord in the spirits of the men 
who have spoken to us, nor in the 
words that they have delivered, but 
the Spirit of God has borne witness 
in our hearts to the truth and the im- 
portance of that which has been de- 
clared to us. We have learned that all 
things are prospering in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Not that we have arrived at perfec- 
tion in the individuals or in any de- 
partment of the Church; there is room 
for improvement in us individually, 
and in the Church as a whole. But 
we have learned that Zion is pros- 
pering. We have learned that the Gos- 
pel is being preached to the world, 
and that the way is being opened up 
among the nations of the earth where- 
by the servants cf God may have free- 
dom to go forward and perform their 
respective missions. We have learned, 
too, that there has been an increase 
in the membership of the Church: that 
although great hosts of people have 
not come forward to embrace the Gos- 
pel, there are some thousands who 
have been baptized into the Church, 
and there are a great many others 
who have been profoundly impressed 
with the message which has been 
borne to them. If it were not for the 
pride of the world, if it were not for 
the fear of the scoffs and scorn of men, 
I am fully presuaded that many thou- 
sands who have heard the testimony 
of the Elders would come forward and 
embrace the Gospel and rejoice with 
us in its glorious privileges. 

The work that is being performed 
by our brethren who are laboring in 
the various mission fields is a very im- 
portant one, and it rests upon all of 
Us Latter-day Saints to do our part in 
this great missionary cause. When , 
the Church was first organized the 
word of the Lord came that every 
man who is warned should warn his 
neighbor; that the testimony which 
was given to the Saints should be 
borne by them for the benefit of 
others, so that the Gospel might go 
forward to every nation, and kindred,

and tongue, and people. This work 
rests upon the Latter-day Saints. It 
is our duty to proclaim the Gospel to 
all the world, and the Lord will open 
up the way from time to time, and 
give His servants access to the honest 
in heart, some of whom will receive 
their testimonies and come out of the 
world to be baptized into Christ and 
become members of His Church upon 
the earth. And now while we are 
bearing this testimony and bringing a 
few into the fold, the seeds that are 
being sown by the-. Elders will, in time, 
bear fruit in a great many directions 
that do not now appear. Like seed 
that is sown in the soil, and disappears 
from view, in the due time of the Lord 
it will bring forth fruit to His honor 
and glory. So we must be encouraged 
in our labors, leaving the result Avith 
the Lord; for though Paul may plant, 
and Apollos may water, it is God Avho 
gives the increase. I believe, with all 
my heart that the testimonies which 
are being borne by these brethren who 
have spoken to us and the Elders who 
are laboring under their direction, Avill 
not fall to the ground, but Avill ac- 
complish a good Avork in due time. 

There are hundreds of thousands Avho 
have heard the Gospel in the flesh and 
through fear or folly have not em- 
braced it, having been afraid to come 
forward and join themselves with this 
unpopular people, when they pass 
aAvay from this stage of being into the 
spirit world will be prepared to receive 
it when it is being preached among 
the spirits that are there. For the 
work that Christ did after He departed 
from the flesh and went and preached 
to the spirits in prison who Avere dis- 
obedient in the days of Noah, will have 
to be repeated and is being repeated 
noAv by the servants of God who have 
gone behind the veil, and it will be 
continued by those who shall follow 
after. While the Saints upon the 
earth are ministering in the temples 
that have been reared, and perform- 
ing the necessary ordinances that per- 
tain to the flesh which cannot be at- 
tended to by people in the spirit land, 
the prophets of the living God, who 



sealed their testimony Avith their blood, 
and their faithful brethren Avho have 
folloAved after them, are now laboring 
among the people behind the veil that 
they may be prepared to receive the 
blessings that shall come to them 
through the labors of the Saints in the 
flesh. For in this dispensation of the 
fullness of times the Lord has promis- 
ed he will gather together in one all 
things that are in Him, both in heaven 
and on the earth, and the work that 
we are performing now in the flesh 
in carrying the Gospel of the kingdom 
to the ends of the earth, and gathering 
in the upright in heart from all 
parts of the Avorld, is but a portion of 
the work of the Latter-day Saints The 
powers of the Holy Priesthood which 
God has revealed are inseparably c 0n - 
nected, he has told us, with the pow- 
ers that are behind the veil. They ar=> 
working together in harmony, and the 
tune will come and it is not far dis- 
tant, when the veil will be taken away 
Avhich separates us from our brethren 
who have gone before, and we will 
Avork Avith them, and they Avith us. We 
will be in perfect harmony; and the 
Priesthood behind the veil will reveal 
to the Priesthood in the flesh, in the 
holy Temples of God Avhere these con- 
versations Avill take place, the names of 
those for whom we must officiate which 
we cannot obtain by the means now at 
our command. This is the Lord's work, 
and it is not only going on here in the 
flesh, but it is going on in the world 
behind the veil among the spirits that 
have departed. Every man Avho has 
been called to hold the Priesthood 
should endeavor to Qualify himself for 
the work that lies before him, both 
that which he will be called to do 
Avhile he dwells in the body, and that 
which he will have to perform when 
he goes out of the body; for it is a fact 
that when we go away from here we 
will take with us that which we have 
spiritually. That intelligence which 
Ave gain, that knowledge of principle, 
that fellowship we have with the heav- 
ens, that Holy Priesthood which we 
bear, that divine spirit by which we 
have been inspired, and all the pow- 
ers that we have gained in being ex-

errised in the duties of the Holy Priest- 
hood, will be strength and power and 
might to us when we depart from the 
body and are delivered from the weak- 
ness of mortality, and called to labor 
in the world of spirits. The same au- 
thority, the same power, the same intel- 
ligence, the same experiences that we 
have had here we" will have there. We 
will not leave any of it with our bodies 
to be dropped down in the grave. An- 
other thing: if we are not diligent, if 
we are dilatory, if we are negligent, if 
we do not prize this authority that the 
Lord has sent down out of Heaven in 
the last days for us to use for the salva- 
tion of the souls of men, we shall not 
be wafted into light, intelligence, pow- 
er, and glory when we go out of the 
body, but will merely carry with us 
that which we have when we drop our 
bodies. Therefore every man holding 
the Priesthood should endeavor to qual- 
ify himself for the work of th& min- 
istry, in time and in eternity, so that 
we may labor under the direction of 
the Captain of our salvation until re- 
demption shall come to all the race, 
and "every knee shall bow and every 
tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ, 
to the glory of God the Father." 

In the opening remarks made by 
President Smith, he stated that we were 
building up this Church to Jesus Christ. 
That is a very important point for us 
to keep in mind, in view of the fact 
that the trend of modern religious 
thought is in the direction of holding up 
Jesus of Nazareth simply as a great 
man and wise teacher. This idea has 
been preached right here in Salt Lake 
City; it is being preached in all the 
great cities of the land, that Jesus is 
to be looked upon as a model man, and 
great teacher, but not in any sense the 
Son of God in the way He is proclaimed 
in the Scriptures. All those expres- 
sions concerning His being one of the 
Godhead a|re spiritualized, and the 
trend of modern thought in the relig- 
ious world, as I have said, is in the di- 
rection of placing Jesus of Nazareth 
on the plane of mortality. It was pro- 
claimed in this city not long ago that 
Jesus died like any other man, or sim- 
ply as a martyr; that he was put to 



death, and died because he could not 
live any longer, and he was the embodi- 
ment of righteousness and truth, and in 
that way, and that way alone, He was 
the way, the truth, and the light. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the 
Lord has revealed something concern- 
ing the personality of Jesus of Nazareth 
and what he stands for, and our rela- 
tionship to him. We frequently bear 
testimony concerning Joseph the 
Prophet, as we ought to do, for we 
should "praise the man who communed 
with Jehovah," and whom "Jesus an- 
ointed as prophet and seer;' but when 
we bear testimony that Joseph Smith 
was a Prophet of God we do in effect 
proclaim the truth that Jesus or. Naz- 
areth is the Messiah, the Son of God. 
the Redeemer of the world, the Resur- 
rection and the Life, the Way and the 
Truth, and that only by and through 
Him can we approach the Father. That 
is the great doctrine for which Joseph 
Smith stood, and lived, and died as a 
martyr. In the beginning, the Father 
and the Son appeared to him in that 
grove which Brother George Albert 
Smith was talking about this morning, 
where the company .that went to dedi- 
cate the monument to the Prophet met 
and sang the song of Joseph's first 
vision. The Father and the Son ap- 
peared to Joseph, and the Father.point- 
ing to the Son, said: "This is My be- 
loved Son, hear Him." He is the Way, 
the Truth and the Life, and He is the 
light of the world. He was in the be- 
ginning with the Father. You can read 
it in this Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. I will not turn to it now, but 
you read the 76th section, in which the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rig- 
don tell us that they beheld the Father, 
seated upon His throne, and Jesus 
Christ, His Son, by His side; and they 
bear witness — the last witness of Him 
— that they saw Him in the heavenly 
vision, and they learned that "By Him 
and through Him, and of Him the 
worlds were made, and the inhabitants 
thereof were begotten sons and daugh- 
ters unto God." 

In the Book of Mormon we read from 
the words of Jesus Christ Himself to 
the people on this continent, to whom 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



He appeared after His resurrection, 
that He is the Savior of the world; 
that He was with the Father in the be- 
ginning; that by Him the worlds were 
framed, and that He came at the time 
appointed and died for the sins of the 
world, that all who believed in Him and 
obeyed His Gospel might obtain eternal 
life. The same things are revealed in 
Sec. 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
Jesus Christ says there, "Behold I was 
in the beginning with the Father, and 
am the first born." He proclaimed this 
Himself, in this revelation; and all 
through the revelations in the Doctrine.' 
and Covenants and in the Book of Mor- 
mon, the great truth is proclaimed that 
that person who was known as Jesus of 
Nazareth, who was born at Beth- 
lehem, who was cradled in a manger, 
who was brought up as the son of Jos- 
eph, the carpenter, and when he became 
30 years of age was baptized in the 
Jordan, and who after the ministry of 
about three and a half years, was put 
to death, was in very deed the Son of 
God, and that he was in the beginning 
with the Father. When God said "Let 
us make man in our own image, and af- 
ter our own likeness," He spoke to His 
beloved Son, who is called in the New 
Testament the "first begotten," "the be- 
ginning of the creation of God." Read 
the first chapter of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews where the great truth is pro- 
claimed by the Apostle, that "God who 
at sundry times, and in divers manners 
spake unto the fathers in times past 
by the prophets, hath in these last days 
spoken unto us by His Son, whom He 
has appointed heir of all things, by 
whom also he made the worlds." It 
goes on to tell that after he had purged 
us from our sins by His atonement, He 
ascended to the heavens and sat down 
at the right hand of the majesty on 
high. This is the truth that we have 
to proclaim to the world. That Jesus of 
Nazareth is one of the Holy Trinity. 
In the words of the Apostle John, which 
are repeated here in the Doctrine and 
Covenants from the mouth of Christ 
Himself, "In the beginning was the 
Word, and the Word was with God, and 
the Word was God." Jesus is God. "All 



things were made by Him, and without 
Him was not anything made that was 
made." That is the testimony of John. 
And Jesus Himself bore testimony to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that this is 
the truth, and that he is the Word, and 
the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. 

In proclaiming this Gospel of the 
Kingdom to the world we are proclaim- 
ing the Gospel of Jesus, the good tid- 
ings and glad news that Jesus was the 
Messiah, that He is the Son of God, 
that as He built up the Church when 
He was upon the earth in the flesh, s o 
He has built up His Church anew in 
the last days, because after the death 
of His apostles, darkness came into the 
world, and apostasy from the truth, 
and the Priesthood was taken away, 
but He has restored it, and He is at 
the head of this Church. Every one of 
these revelations in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, one or two of which we 
have heard read this afternoon, have 
come from Him. It is the voice of 
Jesus Christ to Joseph the Prophet, and 
to others who are spoken of here. He 
is our living head. We worship God in 
his name, and all the ordinances that 
are performed in this Church are done 
in the name of Jesus Christ, the Sa- 
vior of the world. When He died He 
did not die as we do; for He declared 
himself: "No man taketh My life. 1 
have power to lay down my life, and I 
have power to take it up again. And. 
this commandment I have received of 
My Father." So when Christ died He 
voluntarily laid down His life for His 
brethren; and greater love hath no man 
than this. 

We sang at the opening of the ser- 
vices this afternoon "Worthy the 
Lamb." Yes, indeed, praise, and honor, 
and glory, and power will be unto the 
Lamb forever and ever, But when He 
comes again it will not be as a Lamb, 
although He is still without blemish 
and without spot — the spotless Lamb of 
God — but He will come as the King of 
kings, to sit on the throne of His an- 
cestor David, and to rule and reign 
from the rivers to the ends of the earth. 
He will come in triumph, and in power, 
and the kingdom will be built up to

Him, and the people will be prepared 
for His coming through the ordinances 
which He has revealed and the spirit 
which He ia pouring' out. He will come 
"the second time without sin un- 
to salvation." We are building 
up this Church to Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer, who died for us 
that we might be redeemed from the 
effects of the fall; that as through the 
transgression of our first parents' death 
came into the world, which is the waget> 
of sin, so by the perfect righteousness 
and atonement and voluntary death 
of our Redeemer we shall all be raised 
from the dead, every one of Adam's 
race, and appear before the Judgment 
Seat, and give an account of our own 
acts. By faith in Jesus Christ, and 
obedience to His Gospel, we shall be 
cleansed from our sins, and by repen- 
tance and baptism they shall be blotted 
out through the atonement and good 
works of Jesus our Redeemer and Sav- 
ior of the world. These simple truths 
should be impressed and stamped upon 
every soul in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We wor- 
ship the Father in His name. We bow 
to Him. The priesthood that we hold 
is a priesthood after the order of the 
Son of God. We minister in His name. 
We minister by the power and influence 
which He has sent down from the heav- 
ens. Joseph Smith the prophet was, 
His servant, His mouthpiece, and he 
received from Jesus Christ all the light, 
intelligence, and truth there is mani- 
fested in the records that we have. 

I wish to bear my testimony to this 
congregation that Jesus Christ is still 
with His people, with His priesthood, 
with His servants upon whom He has 
conferred authority to minister in His 
name. Every key of power and authority 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith has 
been handed down to his successors, 
and is now vested in the man who 
stands at our head, President Joseph 
F. Smith, who is the lawful successor 
of his ancestor, and who is clothed with 
the power and authority of his calling. 
The Lord is with him, and His powei 
is around about him; and when the 
Lord Jesus Christ desires to make any- 



thing more manifest for the govern- 
ment of His church (for this is Hls> 
church) He will reveal it through His 
servant who is appointed for that pur- 
pose. His spirit permeates the whole 
church, and all of the people receive of 
it according to their faith and their 
faithfulness, their diligence, and their 
persistence in seeking after it. There 
are some of my brethren and sisters, 
I .am sorry to say, who are not diligent 
in seeking after these things. The 
Lord is near unto every one of us, foi 
in Him we live, and move, and havi 
our being. We can seek Him; we can 
ask and receive; we can seek and find; 
we can knock and the door will bt 
opened to us; and every comfort and 
blessing pertaining to the everlasting 
Gospel enjoyed at any period of thx-, 
world's history can b e enjoyed today. 
But they must be sought after by the 
prayer of faith, and by diligence, obedi- 
ence, and by being in harmony with 
Jesus Christ our living head. His 
spirit will permeate the Church. His 
spirit will prompt His people if the> 
will be obedient to His laws. These 
prophecies which Brother John Henry 
Smith read to us this afternoon from 
the fifty-ninth section" of the "Doctrim. 
and Covenants" are of great import- 
ance, and there are blessings promised 
predicated upon obedience to these 
laws. Read what the Lord has prom- 
ised to us if we will keep these com- 
mandments. There will indeed be bless- 
ings not a few, and revelations in the 
time thereof; for God is a God of revt- 
iation, and His spirit is a spirit of rev- 
elation, and He and Jesus Christ and 
the Holy Ghost do not change. They 
are the same yesterday, today, and foi- 
ever; and they are not afar off. Thej 
do not count distance as we do. Wt, 
can ask and receive, and while we arc 
asking we can be receiving. The time-, 
is to come, according to ancient prophe- 
cy, when before we have done asking 
we shall receive, because we shall bt 
brought into such close harmony with 
the powers that are on high. This is 
what we need in our homes; to have thb 
spirit of Christ in our hearts, to be 
kind, forebearing and charitable, to

love one another, to seek to bless all 
mankind and not curse, and to be pa- 
tient. When we are reviled against, 
when our enemies speak evil of us, 
when they try to do us injury, wo 
should possess our souls in patienct 
and wait for the Lord to move. Thoso 
who will not repent we should leave in 
His hands. We have no desire to do in- 
jury to any living- being. I know that 
this is the spirit of Christ, and that we 
should cherish it. We should not de- 
sire to curse or to retaliate, but to 
bless and to do good, to build up and 
not to destroy. If we will seek for 
this spirit, realizing that Christ is our 
living head, and that our brethren wht 
are called to labor in our midst are 
His servants, and we are all building 
up a church to Christ and should pat- 
tern after Him in all His perfections 
as far as we can, peace will be in our 
minds and in our hearts, and the pow- 
er of God will be upon the elders in 
carrying the Gospel to the ends of the 
earth, and the Lord will bear them 
up and bring them off more than con- 
querors. 

While thinking about the great bless- 
ings we are enjoying, the splendid con- 
dition of the Church, financially and 
spiritually, the means that are being 
employed for the extension of the work 
and for providing employment, the 
thought came to my mind, supposing it 
were not so; supposing that instead of 
our hearing these comforting and en- 
couraging reports and learning how the 
work is prospering, and spreading 
forth, and on what solid foundations 
the Church is being reared, and how 
everything is smiling and pleasant, we 
should hear another story — that clouds 
were coming over us, that it was a day 
of trial, a day of temptation, a day when 
we are to be proven, a day when it 
would seem almost as though the Lord 
had forsaken us, like it was with Jesus 
when He was nailed to the cross. "My 
God, My God, why hast thou forsaken 
me," was His cry. Not that God had 
forsaken Him, but He left Him to bear 
the brunt, that He might feel the pain, 
that He might understand the anguish, 
that He might comprehend how people 
feel u ben they are in sorrow, that He 



might be touched with a feeling for out 
infirmities, because He bore the pains of 
us all. Supposing that we should be 
in such a condition, should we falter, 
should we fail, should we shrink? No, 
my brethren and sisters, we should 
stand Arm in the liberty wherewith God 
has made us free. We should stand in 
our lot and place. We should be ready 
to labor for Zion, to carry the Gospel 
forth to the nations of the earth, to la- 
bor at home, to do anything and every- 
thing that we can, in joy or in sorrow, 
in prosperity or in adversity, in times 
that are good and times that appear to 
be bad. We should always be on hand, 
in season and out of season, ready to 
perform our duty to the very best of 
our ability; and if we will do that God 
will fight our battles. And if clouds do 
arise and sometimes difficulties and 
barriers appear to be raised in our 
way, God has the power and will exer- 
cise it to sweep them out of our path. 
"Zion will rise and shine, and the glory 
of God will be seen upon her, and 
kings will come to her light, and gen- 
tiles to the brightness of her rising," 
as the prophets of old have predicted. 
The Lord has to do with those things 
that are temporal as well as those thai 
are spiritual; for He 'has declared that 
"for brass He will bring gold, and for 
stones iron, and for iron He will bring 
silver," and He will beautify Zion and 
cause her to shine and be made glori- 
ous. He will convert unto her the 
abundance of the riches of the earth; 
for they are all the Lord's, and th<» 
Lord has an interest in the earth He 
has made. He fashioned it, He made it 
with His hands. As we sing sometimes, 
"His hands prepared the dry land; the 
sea is His and He made it." The cat- 
tle upon a thousand hills are His, and 
the fullness of the earth and the pre- 
cious things (as we look upon them) 
are His, and He can convert them and 
will do it to our good when we an 
ready to use them properly. The Lord 
is in the temporal as well as in the 
spiritual things of His kingdom, and 
will be if we keep His commandments 
and seek to sanctify them in His ser- 
vice. That is the point. As with Him,

all things will be spiritual to us, if we 
use them to the glory of G-od and the 
benefit of our fellow creatures. 

I rejoice with all my soul in the 
midst of this congregation this after- 
noon. I have spent many years ' in this 
glorious ministry, and the Lord has 
blessed me, strengthened and supported 
me, and has prolonged my days. All 
I am and; all I have are His, and I de- 
sire to devote them still to His service, 
to- labor for the salvation of mankind, 
the living and the dead; to work undei 
the direction of Jesus Christ, our Lord, 
and His servants whom He has ap- 
pointed to minister for Him. I praise 
Him with all my soul this afternoon foi 
His mercies. I magnify His holy name. 
I bear my testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Savior of the world, and 
that through Him and by Him tht. 
worlds were made, and through Him 
and by Him they will be redeemed, and 
light and truth will prevail and dark- 
ness and evil will be overcome. Satan 
will be bound and mankind will be re- 
deemed from his thrall; the Christ will 
reign over tbe earth, and those who 
are true and faithful unto Him will 
reign with Him in glory. May the 
peace and blessing of God abide with 
us all, for Christ's sake. Amen. 

AUDITING COMMITTEE'S REPORT. 

President Smith then read the follow- 
ing report of the auditing committee 
appointed at the last semi-annual con- 
ference. 

Salt Lake City, Uta April 4, 1906. 

President Joseph F. Smith and Coun- 
selors, Salt Lake City. 

Dear Brethren — We, the committee 
appointed to audit the accounts of the 
Church for the year 1905, beg leave 
to report as follows: 

We have examined the accounts of 
the Trustee-in-Trust, and are pleased 
to say that they are kept in a very 
business-like manner, that the me- 
chanical part is very well done, and 
that as a matter of bookkeeping they 
leave nothing to be desired. 

We have also examined the ac- 
counts of the Presiding Bishop's office, 
together with the auxiliary accounts 
which are reported to that office. 
These accounts cover a very wide 



range, as you are aware, dealing with 
every stake president and bishop in 
the Church; and also dealing, as they 
do, with things other than cash, there 
is a large amount of labor and a great 
degree of technical knowledge of book- 
keeping and executive ability involved 
in properly keeping them, and we are 
pleased to say that we found every- 
thing in a very satisfactory condition. 
The accounts are as accurately kept 
as those of any bank or mercantile in- 
stitution of a high order. We also 
noted that the presidents of stakes and 
bishops of wards are so fully instruct- 
ed in reference to the care of the 
revenues of the Church which come 
into their hands that there is a very 
c-mall percentage of loss or waste, and 
the accounting is made on an intelli- 
gent and comprehensive basis. 

We also audited the books of the 
Deseret News, and found that the ac- 
counts have been kept with care and ■ 
accuracy. The Deseret News, in our 
judgment, is ably and judiciously man- 
aged, and the business is in a prosper- 
ous condition. 

It gives us pleasure to report to you 
Anally, that the accounting in the dif- 
ferent departments leaves no room for 
criticism, and so pleased were we with 
the condition in which we found things 
that our labors have occasioned us 
great satisfaction. 

The purposes for which disburse- 
ments of the tithing revenues have 
been made are exclusively for the use 
and benefit of the various interests of 
the Church, and therefore meet with 
our commendation and approval. We 
are satisfied from our investigations 
that the financial affairs of the Church, 
under the direction of the First Presi- 
dency, have been conducted in a most 
conservative and economical manner. 
Tour Brethren, 

RUDGER CLAWSON, 
W. W. RITER, 
•CHARLES W. NIBLEY, 
A. W. CARLSON, 
Members of the Auditing Committee. 

President Smith repeated a former 
statement that any tithe-payer who 
is dissatisfied with the manner in which 
disbursements are made has the privi- 
lege of inspecting the Church records at 
any time. 

The question of accepting the report 
of the committee was put to the con- 
ference by President Lyman with the 
result that the report was accepted 
unanimously. 

The choir, with soloists, sang, "Why 
Do the Nations Rage."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

(Closing address.) 

Religious and secular educational institu- 
tions of the State flourishing.— Re- 
sources of the State heing developed. — 
Spiritual condition of the Saints excel- 
lent. — The Lord will sustain His Church 
and people.— Sorrow because of vacan- 
cies that have occurred in Councils of 
the Twelve and Seventies. 

We feel that our time is very pre- 
cious when there is so large a gather- 
ing of representatives of the various 
departments of the Church, conse- 
quently our discourses are necessarily 
brief. We have heard from quite a 
number of our brethren during the 
conference as to the condition of af- 
fairs among the Saints who are gath- 
ered in Zion, and also in the various 
missions throughout the United States. 
We have heard of the great good that 
is being accomplished by the Church 
school system, and the great expense 
which the Church has incurred in 
sustaining our Church schools in the 
stakes of Zion. A splendid work is 
also being done in our state by the 
district schools, the high schools, the 
Agricultural College, the University, 
and by denominational schools; for 
the Latter-day Saints are not the only 
people who believe in church school 
education. Our Christian brethren of 
various denominations have establish- 
ed some excellent schools, and these, 
together with the Latter-day 
Saint schools, are aiding very much 
to place this state in the front rank 
educationally. As a State, w.e are en- 
titled to congratulation for the educa- 
tional effort put forth. The agricul- 
tural resources of the State are being 
developed; the mineral deposits are 
being opened up, and we are becoming 
one of the rich states. Though we are 
not quite 60 years of age, we compare 
favorably with the states about us. 
some of which are older and some 
younger. The Latter-day Saints are 
doing their part in this, and are re- 
ceiving their fair measure of pros- 
perity and blessing. They have led 
out particularly in developing the ag- 
ricultural and educational departments 
of the State, and have done consider- 



able also in developing the mineral 
resources of the country; and in com- 
mon with the other people of the 
State, they are sharing in the pros- 
perity. Our sugar industry has been 
referred to. Tt has brought much 
wealth to our state, although it has 
only been running a few years, and 
the prospects are altogether favorable 
for the future. We have led the way 
in this industry in the United States; 
at least, we have very closely followed 
those that have been in the lead. 

The Lord has blessed His work. Tou 
have heard the testimonies of our 
brethren in regard to the truth of this 
work. The Lord has established it, 
and will maintain it to the end. We 
understand that it is established never 
to be thrown down, and never to be 
given to another people. The Lord 
has blessed us individually with a posi- 
tive testimony in regard to the truth, 
so that whatever afflictions and trials 
come upon us, we do not fall simply 
because others do. If calamity comes 
upon one, it is not necessary that an- 
other should fall down; the Lord will 
sustain every individual member of 
His Church. Whatever we may have 
to grapple with in this life, whatever 
losses, financial or otherwise, the Lord 
will sustain us if we will but remain 
faithful and true to him. Up to this 
date the Lord has not forsaken His 
people. He never will forsake them; 
He will care for them as a whole, and 
ir> the various departments of His 
kingdom. He has ordained that in the 
organization, which is so perfect in 
all its departments, there shall be no 
breach. There shall nothing occur to 
break the force and power of this 
work. Men may die; men may aposta- 
tize and turn from the truth, families 
and lar.ge numbers of people may. 
There have at different times been 
losses to the Church by schisms and 
other troubles; but the Church has 
been so trained and disciplined, during 
its existence of seventy-six years, that 
today there is a solid phalanx of veter- 
ans who have seen service and passed 
through trials and tribulations with- 
out being disturbed. So when afflic- 



PRESTIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

tions come, when difficulties arise, and 
we are threatened from all directions, 
we possess our souls in patience and 
wait upon the Lord, for we do know 
that this work is the Lord's. 
The Prophet Joseph Smith has 
accomplished his mission on the earth; 
the same with President Young, Presi- 
dent Taylor, President Woodruff, and 
President Snow. President Joseph P. 
Smith is with us today, and he will ac- 
complish his mission, as his predeces- 
sors have done, and will go to his re- 
ward. So will we all in due time; but 
we will not go till we get through; and 
we intend to be just as long getting 
through and finishing our work on this 
earth as we possibly can be. In other 
words, we intend to live. 

I say to the Latter-day Saints that 
we have everything to encourage us, to 
increase our faith, and establish our 
standing and fellowship in the favor of 
the Lord. We have no reason to find 
fault or complain. We may have trials 
ourselves; we may have di;culties 
with our neighbors; various things 
happen that we consider very serious 
afflictions at times, but they prove ben- 
eficial in the end to those who are» 
faithful. They demonstrate the 
strength of the fibre of which we are 
made, and the measure of testimony 
and faith that we have in the Lord. 
The Latter-day Saints can be trusted; 
they have always been worthy to b(* 
trusted. They have been true and 
faithful, and will be to the end, as a 
people. We need have no trouble or 
fear, for we have been made free by the 
Truth. The Gospel we have embraced 
has made us able to endure the trials 
and hardships of life. We are increas- 
ing in numbers, in wealth, in influence 
and in power, and the Lord is entitled 
to the credit, for it is He that enables 
us to do it. We are under obligation to 
Him for our very being, as well as for 
what we are accomplishing. 

I want to draw attention to the fact 
that throughout Zion, not only is there 
material prosperity, the result of agri- 
culture, mining, manufacturing and th t 
"ke, but there is spiritual prosperity 
also. Our houses of worship are being 
greatly improved, and we are building 



splendid new meetinghouses, almost 
like temples; I am not sure but we have 
gone a little to the extreme in that re- 
gard. The school buildings throughout 
the state are very creditable; in fact, 
when you travel and see what has been 
accomplished in this line, you can dis- 
cover that there is faith in the hearts of 
the people of this state, and a love for 
education, and they are generous in 
the building of schoolhouses, academies 
and universities. The spirit of educa- 
tion has taken hold of the people, and 
we are in the front rank with states 
that are more than a hundred years 
old. In these matters we have nothing 
to be ashamed of. When our boys and 
girls obtain all the education they cai. 
in the district schools and high schools 
here, we occasionally send them from 
home into the older states, and even- 
across the water to Europe, that they 
may have the advantages of the best 
schools in the world. In addition to 
that, our people travel largely abroad 
as missionaries, preaching the Gospel 
throughout the world, and thereby get 
training and experience that is most 
valuable. This state, and the states 
and territories surrounding us, when 
the Latter-day Saints are in consider- 
able numbers, are having the benefit of 
all this. 

Now, we feel very grateful for tht 
generous attendance of the people at 
this conference. After drawing atten- 
tion to many good things we have to 
encourage us, and make us happy and 
joyous, and to thank the Lord for, we 
have some things to be very sorrowful 
about. It becomes my duty to an- 
nounce officially to the Church that, on 
the 6th day of February, in the city of 
Richmond, Cache County, our beloved 
brother, President Marriner W. Mer- 
rill, passed from this life, making a va- 
cancy in the council of the Twelve. 
Also to announce to you the resigna- 
tion of our beloved brethren, John W. 
Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley, from 
their positions in that Council, because 
they found themselves out of harmony 
with the Presidency of the Church and 
the quorum to which they belonged. 
Their res'gnations, you may well ap-

preciate, caused us the deepest sorrow 
They were accepted by the Council of 
the Twelve Apostles and the First Pres- 
idency on the 28th day of last October, 
causing' two more vacancies in 'the 
Council. On the 23rd day of December 
last our beloved brother, President 
Christian D. Fjelsted, a member of the 
First Council of Seventies, passed away, 
leaving a vacancy in that presiding

dent, Joseph F. Smith.

from this time forth. The Lord is 
with His people, and they will prosper 
from this time forth more than ever be- 
fore. We have heard today that this ft 
the banner year in our temporal pros- 
perity, but this will seem small con.> 
pared with the prosperity that will at- 
tend the people hereafter. God bless 
you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

he -wished the vote of the Saints be- 
cause it required an expenditure of 
means to heat and light the building - . 
A vote approving the proposition was 

the result.

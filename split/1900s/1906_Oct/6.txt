President Joseph F. Smith. 

The reading of the hymn by Brother John Henry Smith brought to my mind another hymn, which issomething of a sermon in itself; and although I fear I am not as good a reader of hymns as he is, 1 thought I would take the liberty of reading this one and commending it to the Latter-day Saints, that when they return home, if they are not familiar with it, they may turn totheir hymn books and read it welL You will find it in the Latter-day Saints hymn book, on page 434. 

Uphold the right, tho' fierce the fight, 

And pow'rful is the foe; As freedom's friend, her cause defend,. 

Nor fear nor favor show. No coward can be called a man â€”  

No friend will friends betray; ''Who would be free" alert must be; 

Indifference will not pay. 

Note how they toil whose aim is spoil,. 

Who plundering plots devise; Yet time will teach, that fools o'erreach 

The mark and lose the prize. Can justice deign to wrong maintain, 

Whoever wills it so? Can honor mate with treach'rous hate? 

Can figs on thistles grow? 

Dare to be true, and hopeful, too; Be watchful, brave and shrewd; 

Weigh every act; be wise, in fact, To serve the general good. 

Nor basely yield, nor quit a fieldImportant is the fray; 

Scorn to recede, there is no need To give our rights away. 

Left-handed fraud let those applaud 

Who would by fraud prevail; In freedom's name, contest their claim, 

Use no such word as fail; Honor we must each sacred trust, 

And rightful zeal display; Our part fulfil, then, come what will, 

High heaven will clear the way. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn beginning: 

Our God, we raise to Thee, Thanks for Thy blessings free, 

We here enjoy; In this far western land, A true and chosen band, Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Charles F. Middleton. 

Conference adjourned till Saturday morning. Saturday, October 6, 10 a. m. 

Amen.

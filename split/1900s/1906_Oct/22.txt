Elder Reed Smoot. 

I wish, in behalf of my brethren of the Apostles, and of President Smith and his counselors, to thank you for attendance at this session of the conference. We greatly appreciate the same, and say unto you, May God bless you in your labors. May He inspire all the people with the desire to keep His commandments. Mav He lead you by the inspiration of His Holy Spirit to understand the call of the True Shepherd, that you may not in any way, shape, or form be deceived or drawn away from the path of truth and righteousness by the sophistry of wicked men. We love all men, and our mission is to save souls, every one of the souls of the sons and daughters of our heavenly Father. It is also our mission to protect the Church and her interests in all the world. My prayer and hope, and desire is that God will give us the strength and determination to serve Him and walk in His ways. I pray you, my brethren and sisters, to not be discouraged. I testify to you, in the name of Jesus Christ, that God, the Father, is at the head of this work, and all will be well in Zion if we are true and loyal unto Him. 

Peace be in the homes of the Latter-day Saints, peace in your hearts, my brethren and sisters; and God grant that His blessings, the choicest blessings of heaven, and eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God, may come to you. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

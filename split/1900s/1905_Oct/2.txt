President John R. Winder. 

Admonition to the Saints to sustain President Smith as Trustee-in-Trust.â€” Testimony that he is worthy of their confidence. 

My brethren and sisters, my soul is filled with gratitude to my Heavenly Father for permitting me to assemble with you once more in general conference. I have rejoiced exceedingly in what we have heard from our President and I wish to testify that every word he has spoken is true and faithful. I am here to uphold and sustain him in the position he has taken in every particular. All I want to say to you this morning, my brethren and sisters, is in relation to the Trustee-inTrust. I say that your funds are perfectly safe in his hands, and, as he has said, not one dollar is used except where it belongs. I testify to this in your presence this morning, and that all things are well. He is doing just right; and the statement that he has made with regard to the books being open to those who have an interest, is a fact, and you can satisfy yourselves of these things. Now, let all doubts be removed from your minds, if you have any, though I do not believe the Latter-day Saints have any doubts in relation to this matter. There may be a few who have, but the true and faithful Latter-day Saints have no doubt in regard to this subject. I say to you this morning, my brethren and sisters, uphold and sustain the President as Trustee-in-Trust of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and all things will be well with you. May the Lord help us all, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

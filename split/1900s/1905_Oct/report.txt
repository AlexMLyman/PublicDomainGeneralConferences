GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF 
LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 



FIRST DAY. 



The Seventy-sixth Semi-Annual Con- 
ference of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
L<atter-day Saints convened in the Tab- 
ernacle, Salt Lake City, at 10 a. m. on 
Friday, October 6, 1905, President Jo- 
seph F. Smith presiding. 

THE PROCEEDINGS- 

There were present of the First Presi- 
dency, Joseph F. Smith, John R. Win- 
der and Anthon H. Lund; of the Coun- 
cil of the Twelve Apostles, Francis M. 
Lyman, John Henry Smith, Rudger 
Clawson, Reed Smoot, Hyrum M. 
Smith, George A. Smith and Charles 
W. Penrose; of the First Council of 
Seventies, Seymour B. Young, Chris- 
tian D. Fjeldsted, Brigham H. Roberts, 
George Reynolds, J. Golden Kimball, 
Rulon S. Wells and Joseph W. McMur- 
rin; of the presiding Bishopric, William 
B. Preston and Orrin P. Miller. There 
were also a large number of presidents 
of stakes, their counselors, presidents of 
missions, and other prominent men of 
the Priesthood. 

The services were commenced by the 
choir and congregation singing the 
hymn which begins: 

Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor 
fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 
Though hard to you this journey may 
appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. 

The opening prayer was offered by El- 
der John T. Caine. 



The choir and congregation then unit- 
ed in singing the hymn: 

Redeemer of Israel, our only delight, 

On whom for a blessing we call; 
Our shadow by day, and our pillar by 
night, 

Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all! 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(Opening Address.) 

Reasons for thanksgiving to God. — Gen- 
eral condition of the Church highly 
satisfactory. — Injunction urgently re- 
peated, "Get out of debt."— Many 
more missionaries needed. — "Zion is 
growing;" more and larger buildings 
needed for Church schools, etc.— The 
tithing accounts can be seen by tithe- 
payers.— Satan and his agents cannot 
. stop the progress of God's work. 

I desire to say, welcome to all the 
Latter-day Saints, and to our friends 
and the stranger within our gates, at 
the opening of this seventy-sixth semi- 
annual conference of the Church of Je- 
sus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am 
pleased to be with you, and am ex- 
ceedingly grateful to the Lord for His 
kind mercies and preserving care that 
have been extended to us all during 
the past six months, in that we have 
been blessed with life, health and 
prosperity, and have been preserved 
to attend this conference in the enjoy- 
ment of so many precious gifts and 
blessings. I think we may consistent- 
ly congratulate ourselves on the great 
goodness manifested toward us by Him 
from whom all blessings come, in pre-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



serving us in the truth, putting into 
our hearts and continuing' within us 
that earnest desire which we all must 
feel for the upbuilding of Zion, the 
spread of truth, the accomplishment of 
the purposes of the Lord, and for the 
establishment of righteousness in the 
hearts of our children, our associates 
and of the people of the world; and 
that earnest desire also which we all 
should feel for those who are misled 
and are sitting in darkness and know 
not the truth, that we may become 
instrumental in the hands of the Lord 
of extending to all such, as far as it 
may be possible, a knowledge of the 
Gospel which we have embraced, that 
they too may see the light, if they 
choose to do so; and if they choose 
not the light, but prefer to remain 
in darkness, that they may be left 
without excuse. I feel thankful every 
day of my life for that desire in my 
heart, and I would fear that the Lord 
was withdrawing His Spirit from me if 
I did not entertain that feeling, and 
did not have an earnest desire in my 
soul for good, and not for evil. I am 
thankful to the Lord that He gives me 
the desire to do good, and not evil; 
that He leads my thoughts in the chan- 
nels of honor, virtue, uprightness, and 
integrity to those principles which I 
have espoused. And I believe that 
all Latter-day Saints possess thlat 
spirit and feeling in their hearts, and 
that they have reason to be grateful 
to the Lord every day of their lives 
that their ambitions, their hopes and 
their desires are for good, and not for 
evil. The Latter-day Saints possess 
the spirit of salvation, and not the 
spirit of destruction; the spirit of life, 
not the spirit of death; the spirit of 
peace, not of disunion; the spirit of 
love for their fellowbeings, not the 
spirit of hate. And for the enjoyment 
of this spirit by the saints of the Most 
High we all have great cause to render 
praise and thanksgiving to Him who 
has so ordered it, and who has given 
to us humility to receive and that 
measure of His Spirit which inclines 
our hearts to good and not to evil. 

Since our last general conference, 
the general authorities of the Church, 



I believe, have been performing their 
duty to the best of their ability, ac- 
cording to their strength and the gifts 
of God that they possess. They have 
been diligent. Not one of them has 
declined to respond to any call that 
has been made upon him. The Apos- 
tles and the Seventies have been faith- 
ful in attending to the various quar- 
terly conferences of the Church: and 
from all the reports that we have 
heard of their labors, we are given to 
understand that the people have not 
only been satisfied with their ministra- 
tions, but the Apostles and Seventies, 
and the Elders who have accompanied 
them, have reported most satisfactor- 
ily of the condition generally of the 
Latter-day Saints where they have vis- 
ited. 

The reports that we have received 
from the various missions are most 
encouraging, with this one exception: 
the demand from the missionary fields 
for Elders to preach the Gospel to the 
world ■ seems more than we can fill. 
The harvest is truly great, but the 
laborers are few. It seems impos- 
sible for us to meet the requirements 
that are made of us for missionaries. 
In this connection it may be proper 
for me to say that in some instances 
— far too many — these who have been 
invited to go on missions have re- 
plied that while they felt honored with 
the call they regretted to say that their 
circumstances were such that they 
could not see their way clear to go. as 
they were involved in debt. They 
had assumed pecuniary responsibil- 
ities that they could not discharge at 
that time, and they were obliged to 
ask for further time in order to liquid- 
ate their indebtedness and prepare 
themselves to go into the world to 
preach the Gospel. 

For three years and more my text, 
and the text of my brethren, to the 
Latter-day Saints and to ourselves, has 
been, pay your debts; get out 
of debt, and then remain out 
of debt, by living economically, 
by being prudent with means, by sav- 
ing up and gathering in our resources, 
thus preparing ourselves to meet our 
necessities with ready means, instead

of being inclined to go to the stores, to 
the implement shops, and to the vari- 
ous establishments, to purchase goods 
on credit — goods which it might be pos- 
sible for us to do without, at least un- 
til we could pay down for them and 
.get the cash price. Reports have come 
to us from various parts of the Church 
that many of our people are still being 
gulled by traveling agents, and per- 
suaded to enter into obligations for 
wagons, for agricultural implements, 
for sewing machines, for stoves and 
neaters, and for almost every imagin- 
able thing, giving t/!ierefor ironclad 
notes, at highest prices, with agree- 
ments compelling them to surrender 
the goods whenever they fail to pay 
interest and principal as specified, un- 
der which they are liable to have the 
goods taken from them and lose all 
they have paid thereon. Many of our 
people are unwise enough to deal with 
-men in this way. If they would only 
save their means, and live so that they 
will have means on hand instead of be- 
ing obligated to others, it would be far 
oetter for them, and there would be 
fewer excuses on the part of Elders 
who are invited to take missions, in 
consequence of their being involved in 
debt. Besides it would not cost them 
so much to live. We do not mind when 
■a young man is not able to take a mis- 
sion because he is building a home for 
liis wife and is under contract for it. 
That is all right. We will excuse him, 
he is at liberty to remain until he has 
accomplished his home work, and 
when he is ready he can report him- 
.self as prepared to take his mission. 
Now, I repeat to the people present at 
this conference: My injunction, and 
the injunction of my brethren of the 
Presidency and of the Twelve, is, Get 
out of debt; pay your honest obliga- 
tions, free yourselves so that you will 
be at liberty to perform any dutv that 
you desire or that may be asked of 
you for the upbuilding of Zion and 
the spread of truth. We do not care 
what the world says with reference to 
our preaching the Gospel, nor with 
reference to the necessity of young men 
l>eing asked to go out into the world to 



preach the Gospel. In nine hundred 
and ninety-nine times out of a thous- 
and the young men who are asked to 
take missions to the nations of the 
earth respond cheerfully and gladly, 
and rejoice that they are considered 
worthy to go out bearing the message 
of life and salvation to their fellow- 
men. It is a privilege, it is an honor 
to them to be accounted worthy to 
bear the name of God and the mes- 
sage of life and salvation to the world, 
and no amount of ridicule, no amount 
of false accusations and malicious 
charges, will ever change their 
thoughts and feelings with respect to 
this work. They know what they are 
doing. And there is no coercion used 
in matters of this kind. It is all free 
will, all tree grace. Never was there 
a man required to go on a mission to 
the world, or sent on a mission, who 
had any objection to going or who de- 
clined to go. Those who have gone out 
to preach the Gospel have gone willing- 
ly, cheerfully, gladly, because they 
have felt it was to their own advan- 
tage and a great honor. 

Then I repeat, the only difficulty we 
have to meet now with reference to 
the preaching of the Gospel in the va- 
rious missions in the earth is that we 
are unable to furnish the number and 
the character of the help required. We 
would like the young men to prepare 
themselves, financially and intellectu- 
ally, and above all spiritually, having 
the testimony of the Gospel in their 
hearts, that when they shall be called 
to go upon missions they will be ready 
to go. so that we may be in a position 
to supply the Elders necessary to 
preach the Gospel to the world. 

A large amount of means has been 
expended in the erection of meeting- 
houses in the various wards and stakes 
of Zion, and the Trustee-in-Trust has 
been called upon to furnish large sums 
of money to assist; and also, in many 
instances, to assist the people in the 
Creation of church jshoolhouses and 
houses of amusement. We would like 
all the world to know that the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
aims not only to provide houses of 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



worship for its members, but it also 
aims to provide houses of instruction 
and houses of amusement as well, that 
the people of the Church, old and 
young, may have places where they 
can assemble in the dance, in concerts, 
in musical festivals, and in intellectual 
feasts, that they may have scope for 
the enjoyment of every desire of their 
hearts in righteousness. I will say to 
you that the Church has been as liberal 
in these matters as it was possible to 
be in view of the obligations that still 
rest upon the Trustee-in-Trust. Our 
Church schools are increasing, and 
the demand is increasing contin- 
ually for means with which to keep 
them going, and also for the purpose 
of erecting additional buildings to ac- 
commodate the children. When we 
tell you that almost every Church 
school throughout the land is filled to 
overflowing, you may perhaps discern 
the growth of the people of God and 
the progress and advancement of our 
educational institutions. No sooner 
is one building completed than it is dis- 
covered that it is too small, and that 
more room is required. From time to 
time, therefore, we have to assist in 
enlarging and in providing accommoda- 
tion for our children. I think that the 
Latter-day Saints will be able to dis- 
cern in this fact a glorious truth. Zion 
is growing, and interest is being in- 
creased in the hearts of the people in 
proper education and training, to the 
end that our children may go to schools 
where the Bible is not excluded, where 
the Book of Mormon and the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants are admit- 
ted, and where true> religion may be 
taught as well as letters and the scien- 
ces and arts. The Trustee-in-Trust has 
also assisted largely in procuring mis- 
sion houses in Scandinavia, in Great 
Britain, in the islands of the sea, and 
in our own land of America. We are 
now helping to build a place of worship 
and a dwelling-house at Papeete, Ta- 
hiti. We have done the same in Sa- 
moa. Assistance has also been ren- 
dered to the New Zealand mission for 
a similar purpose, and to Australia as 
well. In these island missions we are 



extending aid to our people in order to- 
givo them a better standing and wider 
influence, that they may gain the re- 
spect they merit; for, as a rule, the peo- 
ple of those islands are very poor. 

Since our last conference the Scan- 
dinavian mission has been divided in 
two, for the convenience of the people. 
Sweden has been organized into a mis- 
sion of itself, with headquarters at 
Stockholm; and the Scandinavian mis- 
sion now consists of Denmark and Nor- 
way. 

Casting one's thoughts over all the 
field, we cannot come to any other con- 
clusion than that the work of the Lord 
is alive, healthy and vigorous, in every 
land where the Gospel of the Son of 
God is preached by the Elders of the 
Church. It is spreading abroad, and 
the power and influence of the people is 
growing for good. The strangers who- 
visit us see the contrast between the 
false and slanderous representations 
that are sent abroad with reference to 
the Latter-day Saints and the actual 
conditions existing here, and they go 
away agreeably disappointed, delighted 
with what they see and hear, and con- 
vinced that no people, perhaps, upon 
the earth are so much villified as are 
the Latter-day Saints. I sometimes 
feel that I can see the hand of Provi- 
dence in the work that is going on in 
the world; for surely it only takes an 
eye half open to discover the fraud 
and misrepresentation, the slanders and 
the lies that are circulated throughout 
the world with reference to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. If people will only 
come and see for themselves, if they 
will only take the pains to inform them- 
selves of the truth, and compare condi- 
tions here with the false reports that 
are circulated, the very contrast will, 
make the truth more forceful to their 
minds. 

Brother Horace S. Ensign, who has 
presided for a number of years in the 
Japanese mission, has returned, and the 
presidency of that mission has been 
turned over to Brother Alma O. Taylor. 
A number of young men have recently 
been sent to that mission. The Elders 
that have been there have succeeded In.

learning the language, as is the case in 
other foreign missions. "Wherever the 
Elders of the Church go they are re- 
markable in acquiring speedily and 
thoroughly the language' of the people 
to whom they are sent. Everywhere 
the Spirit of the Lord whispers to the 
honest in heart who are faithful, and 
gives to them the assurance that His 
Tiand is stretched out continually over 
His people; that as, in the past, He has 
preserved them and delivered them out 
-of the hands of their enemies, so in 
the future He will continue to preserve 
and deliver them, and he will make the 
wrath of the wicked to praise Him 
and to accomplish the more speedily 
His purposes. We have every evidence 
to convince us that the work of the 
Lord is a reality, a living, active, pro- 
gressive work in the earth. Let me 
say to you that the Latter-day Saints 
throughout the length and breadth of 
the land have faithfully and honestly, 
I believe, as ever they did in their lives, 
observed the law of tithing. I am 
happy to say to you that the tithes 
of the people have not diminished, but 
they have increased, notwithstanding 
the disasters that have occurred in 
some portions of the land. In some 
parts hailstorms have destroyed por- 
tions of the crops; in other parts there 
have been more or less drouth, and in- 
sects, which have cut short the crops 
in some degree; but this has only been 
to a limited extent; the most of the 
products of the land have been 
blessed and are abundant, and the 
majority of the people have reaped 
bounteous harvests, through the bless- 
ing of God upon their labors. I am 
happy to say this to you. 

I want to say further to the Saints, 
that your brethren to whom you have 
entrusted the care and management of 
the finances of the Church stand ready 
and willing, any moment,' to answer to 
YOU — to Latter-day Saints, to tithe- 
payers, to those who are in the faith 
of the Gospel — for our stewardship. We 
can give you an account of our doings 
to the last senine; and I defy any man 
on earth to point his finger to a dollar 
that is wilfully wasted, or stolen by the 



servants of God. The tithing books are 
kept as accurately and as perfectly a3 
any books kept in any bank. Every 
man that pays a dollar tithing gets his 
credit on the books; and if he wants 
to see that his credit is there he can 
go and see for himself. But we do not 
propose to open our books and show 
your accounts to every Tom, Dick and 
Harry in the land that never did pay 
any tithing. We do not propose to do 
that, if we can help it. But you Lat- 
ter-day Saints who pay your tithes 
and your offerings, if you want to see 
for yourselves, that you may be eye 
and ear witnesses, the books are open 
to you, and you can come and examine 
your accounts any business day you 
want. 

Now, we are thankful to the Lord 
that we are counted worthy to be taken 
notice of by the devil. I would fear 
very much for our safety if we had 
fallen into a condition where the devil 
ceased to be concerned about us. So 
long as the Spirit of the Lord is enjoyed 
by you, so long as you are living your 
religion and keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord, walking uprightly 
before Him, I assure you that the ad- 
versary of souls will not rest easy; he 
will be discontented with you, will find 
fault with you, and he will arraign you 
before his bar; but that will not hurt 
you very much if you will only just 
keep on doing right. You do not need 
to worry in the least, the Lord will 
take care of you and bless you. He 
will also take care of His servants, and 
will bless them and help them to ac- 
complish His purposes; and all the 
powers of darkness combined in earth 
and in hell cannot prevent it. They 
may take men's lives; they may slay 
and destroy, if they will; but they can- 
not destroy the purposes of God, nor 
stop the progress of His work. He has 
stretched forth His hand to accomplish 
His purposes, and the arm of flesh can- 
not stay it. He will cut His work short 
in righteousness, and will hasten His 
purposes in His own time. It is only 
necessary for us to try with our might 
to keep pace with the onward progress 
of the work of the Lord, then God

will preserve and protect us, and will 
prepare the way before us, that we 
shall live and multiply and replenish 
the earth and always do His will; 
which may God grant is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang- the anthem, "Lift up 
the voice in singing." 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Admonition to the Saints to sustain Presi- 
dent Smith as Trustee-in-Trust.— Testi- 
mony that he is worthy of their confi- 
dence. 

My brethren and sisters, my soul is 
filled with gratitude to my Heavenly 
Father for permitting me to assemble 
with you once more in general confer- 
ence. I have rejoiced exceedingly in 
what we have heard from our Presi- 
dent and I wish to testify that every 
word he has spoken is true and faith- 
ful. I am here to uphold and sustain 
him in the position he has taken in ev- 
ery particular. All I want to say to 
you this morning, my brethren and sis- 
ters, is in relation to the Trustee-in- 
Trust. I say that your funds are per- 
fectly safe in his hands, and, as he has 
said, not one dollar is used except 
where it belongs. I testify to this in 
your presence this morning, and that 
all things are well. He is doing just 
right; and the statement that he has 
made with regard to the books being 
open to those who have an interest, is 
a fact, and you can satisfy yourselves 
of these things. Now, let all doubts 
be removed from your minds, if you 
have any, though I do not believe the 
Latter-day Saints have any doubts in 
relation to this matter. There may be 
a few who have, but the true and faith- 
ful Latter-day Saints have no doubt 
in regard to this subject. I say to you 
this morning, my brethren and sisters, 
uphold and sustain the President as 
Trustee-in-Trust of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 
all things will be well with you. May 
the Lord help us all, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

Su cess in Grrece. South Africa, and

the gathered Saints. 



I am indeed happy this morning to 
see this large congregation at the first 
session of our conference. It shows 
that the Latter-day Saints are alive in 
their religion and anxious to meet in 
these gatherings of the Saints. They 
want to be built up and refreshed in 
their holy faith. I was pleased to look 
at your faces and to note the atten- 
tion with which you followed the re- 
marks of our President and Bro her 
Winder. Like Brother Winder, I can 
endorse everything the President has 
said. We are in a position to know 
that it is the truth. 

I was pleased to follow the President 
in his sketch of the work being done 
abroad. We feel indeed interested in 
the missionary labors, and it is a p eas- 
ure to tell you how gladly our brethren 
respond to the calls made upon them 
to go upon missions. I do not 1 e- 
member more than one or two refusals 
during the last six months. The g eat 
majority have expressed themselves as 
honored in being car.ed to go, and they 
say that they feel it is their duty to go 
and let the world know what they 
themselves have received. It is pleas- 
ant to read these letters from our you g 
men, middle aged men, and even o d 
men, who have been called to go out 
and bear their testimonies to the world. 

A great deal has been done in diffus- 
ing the printed word to the world. I 
believe the British mission lead? in 
this, but, take all our missions together, 
the number of tracts and boo'cs tint 
have been scattered among the people 
has run up into millions. Our brethren 
are faithful in going from hou~e to 
house, leaving tracts, trying to get into 
conversation with the people, to let 
them know the glorious truth that God 
has again spoken unto man. The B~>ok 
of Mormon is sought after. The pr si- 
dents of missions in the United States 
have printed large editions and are 
circulating thern everywhere, selling 
them as cheaply as possible, that the 
world may become acquainted with trat 
sacred volume, which has been given 
by God unto this generation. Our 
French edition is gone; another must 
be published. The Swedish edition of 
the Book of Mormon is out of print, 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

and another must be printed there. The 
Turkish Saints are asking that they 
may have this volume printed in the 
Turkish language. It has been trans- 
lated by Brother Hintze and assistants, 
and we intend to have it published, 
and try to get it into the Ottoman 
empire. It is hard to get printed mat- 
ter into that country, as they are 
afraid of books, afraid that there is 
something in them inimical to the gov- 
ernment. Whenever you land at a port 
the custom officers are suspicious of 
ycur books, and they have them exam- 
ined before they allow you to take them 
into the country. Hence the difficulty 
we will have in getting the Book of 
Mormon to the people there. We would 
print it in Constantinople and thus 
have it in the country, but we find that 
should we try to get it into the other 
provinces of Turkey we would have 
the same difficulty to pass the custom 
officers, whether it has the government 
permit stamped on it or not. They say 
that anyone could print that on the 
book, and so it is left to the custom 
house officers to decide. But we be- 
lieve we shall yet be able to get that 
work into the hands of the people of 
that land. The work of the Lord is 
progressing there; still our Armenian 
Saints are having a hard time. It is 
a poor country to live in, and the Saints 
are not yet recognized as a religious 
body by the government. We have not 
very many Elders laboring there at 
present, but will try to get more. At 
Athens, in Greece, there are several 
persons inquiring about the truth. We 
were indeed pleased a few weeks ago 
to receive from them several tracts 
printed in Athens in the Greek lan- 
guage. They are "Rays of Living 
Light," written by Elder Penrose, and 
had been translated into that lan- 
guage. These Greeks had received 
copies of those tracts, and they thought 
them worth translating and printing, 
and sending out among their country- 
men. They are now asking for mis- 
sionaries to be sent to them to of- 
ficiate in the ordinances of the Gospel. 
This shows that the Spirit of God is 
working upon the people, and that men 



are seeking for the truth. We are try- 
ing to get the Gospel principles sent 
to every nation. Our brethren who 
were sent to South Africa found mem- 
bers of the Church who received the 
Gospel there many years ago, when 
the mission was first opened, and al- 
though they have not been visited by 
Elders, for many years, they have kept 
the faith and have tried to make others 
understand the truth as they have re- 
ceived it. Our Elders have been suc- 
cessful in baptizing new members, and 
the Church there is increasing in num- 
bers. Brother Alma O. Taylor, presi- 
dent of the Japanese mission is engag- 
ed in translating the Book of Mormon. 
He has been wonderfully blest in learn- 
ing that language. Several of the El- 
ders with him are also able to preach 
in Japanese and are traveling amongst 
the people. Brother Ensign, who has 
recently returned accomplished a great 
work in translating hymns into the 
Japanese language and setting them to 
music, so that the Japanese can sing 
our hymns and feel the spirit that goes 
with them. They have not bapt'zed 
very many, though they have had 
many applications for baptism, but the 
brethren feel that before they baptize 
anyone he should understand the Gos- 
pel, have faith in God and in His Son 
Jesus Christ, and know concerning the 
work that God has established upon the 
earth. The method of preaching the 
Gospel to a people that do not bel eve 
in the true God is. of course, much 
different from the way we preach it to 
those who are believers in the Bible, 
and in Christ as the Savior of mankind. 
The brethren are seeking to reach the 
children there, and they have a large 
attendance at Sunday schools. The 
children are delighted to hear the 
teachings of the Elders and to sing our 
hymns, and in the streets of Tokio you 
can often hear the little ones sing our 
Sunday school songs. These children 
go home and tell their parents what 
they have learned in the Mormon Sun- 
day school, and their parents get in- 
terested themselves. I consider that 
the Elders there are taking the right

course to reach the hearts of the people 
of that nation. 

It is indeed pleasing 1 to us to see the 
progress that the work is making in 
the different parts of the earth, and I 
hope to see this progress accelerated 
and the benign influences of the Gospel 
he felt more and more among the peo- 
ple. At home, we feel that the Saints 
in the different Stakes are progressing 
in all good works. The quarterly con- 
ferences that have been held in all of 
the 55 Stakes have been times of re- 
joicing, and spiritual feasts unto all 
present, and we believe that the Saints 
are growing in grace with God. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I rejoice to 
be with you. I rejoice to be a fellow- 
laborer with you in building up the 
Church of Christ upon the earth. This 
work will prosper and it will not be 
given to any other people. The Lord 
has so declared it. This people will 
carry it on. and the Lord will crown 
their efforts with success. God bless 
ycu all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Gospel principles did not originate with 
Joseph Smith.— Joseph called of God to 
be a great prophet— Gathering and 
Temple building.— The Church of Christ, 
and His disciples, always persecuted.— 
The Saints loyal to the nation, and to 
the Church— The Church thoroughly es- 
tablished. 

I have been very greatly interested in 
the remarks of our brethren, and, with 
the assistance of the Spirit of the Lord 
I shall take pleasure in talking to you 
for a few moments. The congregation 
this morning is unusually large for 
the first meeting, which indicates that 
the Saints are interested and are anx- 
ious to participate in the conference. 
The testimonies that we have listened 
to from the Presidency find an echo in 
our hearts. The Latter-day Saints are 
a peculiar people, and every individual 
member of the Church has the same 
kind of testimony that is enjoyed by 
the Presidency. These testimonies are 
not confined to any quorum or council, 
but every member of the Church, 
whether his membership is of long or of 
short duration, has the same abiding 



spirit in his soul, and is established 
and fixed in his faith. For that reason 
there is no danger to this Church, be- 
cause the members thereof enjoy the 
same spirit. We are one; and the doc- 
trines so commend themselves to the 
judgment of honest people, that when 
we have tested them and realized how 
precious, reliable, and soul-satisfying 
they are, we are never inclined to de- 
part from them so long as we are true 
and faithful. The principles of the Gos- 
pel have always been and will always 
be true. They have been revealed to 
us in the latter days. They have not 
been created in this dispensation. They 
have not originated with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, but they have simply 
been brought to light and revealed to 
the children of men in this age. They 
are possessed by the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, the only 
living and true Church established 
among the children of men — this 
Church that has been brought out of 
obscurity into the light and brought to 
»the attention of the peoples of the 
world. We have been preaching these 
doctrines as revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph, for seventy-five years. 
We are in the ministry, and are in- 
creasing gradually, steadily, and surely, 
spreading abroad and becoming more 
solid, substantial and reliable than ever. 
The work is so well settled that it can- 
not be disturbed, so we believe, and 
absolutely know, for it is the work of 
•the Lord. The Lord has called and 
qualified His servants, commencing 
with the Prophet Joseph many years 
ago. He took him in hand, He gave 
him birth, He brought him forward, in- 
troduced him to the world, planted in 
his heart the doctrines of life and sal- 
vation, and early in the last century 
honored him with the sacred calling of 
an Apostle, a Prophet, Seer and Reve- 
lator, a man of God, a living minister, 
endowed with inspiration and revela- 
tion, a law-giver, such a man as has 
rarely ever been known among the 
children of men. I can hardly think of 
one who has been superior to him 
among the prophets and patriarchs of 
God. Of course, the Savior is far in 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

advance of all patriarchs, of all proph- 
ets, and of all men in the earth, that 
are, that have been, or that will be. He 
is at the front and is the head of all. 
But among the prophets of God born of 
women, no man has been superior to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. This con- 
gregation of thousands of people know 
it. Hundreds of thousands of Latter- 
day Saints know it well. We have en- 
tered into covenant with the Lord, we 
have become acquainted with the doc- 
trines and principles of the Gospel, we 
have demonstrated and see and know 
most perfectly that they are the power 
of God unto salvation. Hence we are 
not ashamed of these principles. We 
love them and we honor them, and 
through our love and devotion and 
faithfulness to this cause we have ob- 
tained that remarkable testimony, 
which makes it difficult, if not impossi- 
ble, for our brethren of other denomi- 
nations to convert us to their ways. 

The Latter-day Saints possess the 
truth, and have many principles of 
truth in addition to what is possessed 
by the people of the world. Of course, 
we are peculiar for a- number of rea- 
sons. It is our peculiarities that make 
us different from other Christian peo- 
ple. One of our peculiarities is that we 
gather to the land of Zion, to those 
sections of the country that have been 
selected and set apart for the gathering 
of the Latter-day Saints. Other re- 
ligious denominations have their 
churches and their branches where they 
are successful, but they do not gather 
as we do. No other people, that I can 
think of, at present, gather together 
as we do. This doctrine of the gath- 
ering is one of the remarkable fea- 
tures of this church, established by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

We believe also in the building of 
Temples, and have built several. We 
believe it is necessary for the sal- 
vation of the people living and 
dead, that temples should be built 
to the name of the Lord and or- 
dinances performed therein, without 
which men may not enter into the Ce- 
lestial Kingdom of the Father. No 
other people, so far as I am ac- 
quainted, are building temples. They 



build houses of worship, tabernacles 
and the like, all of which are very use- 
ful, and we build them also, but we 
are remarkable for the building of 
temples. There are doctrines and prin- 
ciples sacred to the hearts of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, revealed through the 
Prophet Joseph, which require us to 
make the sacrifice of gathering togeth- 
ei\ of building temples and of laboring 
for our kindred that are dead. The liv- 
ing must perform that work for them- 
selves or forfeit the blessing, but those 
who have died before the knowledge of 
the truth was among the children of 
men, we believe, are entitled to salva- 
tion, especially if they would have re- 
ceived the truth had it been presented 
to them. We feel that all such are en- 
titled to ' salvation, and we make the 
sacrifice that is necessary for their re- 
demption and for their union through- 
out eternity. We believe most earnest- 
ly and thoroughly that our family rela- 
tions that we enter into in this life 
will continue beyond the resurrection. 
This doctrine has been revealed to us 
by the Prophet of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. We expect that those relations 
so sacred to men in this life will con- 
tinue in the life to come; and we have 
been taught to be true and faithful men, 
and we are such. I say to this congre- 
gation that wa are true and loyal men, 
not only true and loyal to the Church 
and to the doctrines that we have re- 
ceived, but we are true and loyal among 
men, honorable as neighbors and as 
citizens. We love our country, we love 
its laws, its liberties, its institutions; 
we love the people of our nation, and 
we love to live with them, to neighbor 
with them, and to be friendly with 
them. We desire to share with them in 
the benefits of this nation. We desire 
to share with them the benefits of this 
city and of the states and territories in 
which we reside, not only in the United 
States, but where we have spread 
abroad into the neighboring common- 
wealths of Mexico and Canada. Wher- 
ever we settle and locate we desire to 
share with the people, our neighbors, 
the blessings that are given to man- 
kind. We are a moral people, a sober 
people, a God-fearing people, who love 



10 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Of 
course, there are exceptions; but this 
is a rule with the Latter-day Saints. 
I speak of those who are faithful and 
true to the doctrines of the. Lord Jesus 
and who are thoroughly established. 
They are not only here in Salt Lake, 
at headquarters, but they are in the 
cities and counties north, south, east 
and west of us. You cannot find a lit- 
tle branch or ward of Latter-day Saints 
but what they are so thoroughly settled 
and established that an innovator can 
have no influence over them, and they 
cannot be converted unto any other 
form of religion. But we are not all 
Latter-day Saints here, there are some 
of us who are fit subjects for the la- 
bors of missionaries of all denomina- 
tions, whom they may make converts. 
"We thank the Lord when they are con- 
verted, if we have been unable to con- 
vert them and to redeem them. If 
others can do them good, the Lord be 
praised; we have no fault to find. But 
Latter-day Saints, followers of the 
Prophet Joseph, walking in his foot- 
steps and in his doctrines received from 
the Lord Jesus, can no more be turned 
from their faith than anything in the 
world, for they do know, they are 
thoroughly converted, and they are es- 
tablished so that they cannot be moved 
nor led astray. 

This Church the Lord has estab'ished. 
He laid its foundations and has built it 
up. He hath taken care of it and will 
preserve it. You can always knew just 
exactly where the Church of Christ is, 
for where it is the darts of the enemy 
are always directed, and particularly 
against the head of the Church. Was 
not the Savior the head and front of all 
offending- in his life? Was not every 
dart of the enemy directed against the 
Son of God until His life was taken? 
And after Him, His apostles, one by 
one were destroyed; for at that tire 
the people would not endure the sound 
doctrines of the Lord Jesus. And 
is it not the same today? 
Did He not tell His disciples 
that if the world hated them it hue! 
Him also? The world loves its own; the 
world is friendly with its own; and if 



we were of the world and believed as 
they do, worshiped as they do, and 
lived as they do, do you think they 
would find fault with us here? No. 
We believe more and we do a great deal 
more in the direction of the saving of 
mankind than any other body of Chris- 
tianity, and for that reason they dislike 
us. Our lives offend them, not because 
we are wicked, but because we are not 
of them. They were not offended with 
the Savior because of his transgres- 
sions; they were not offended with His 
apostles because of their sins. 
There is no need of sentiment being 
aroused in regard to people, who are 
wicked and corrupt, for the law is 
ready to take hold of them; and, if ww 
transgress the law, we are subject tp 
the law and liable to be handled by 
it. But as Latter-day Saints we live 
above the law. We observe the law 
and keep it sacred, that it shall not 
take hold of us. We are true to oui 
cities and counties, to our state and tc 
our nation. We are loyal, and, as I 
said before, we love the institutions of 
our country. We thank the Lord for 
the religious liberty that is guaranteed 
in the United States. We thank Him 
for the protection that has been given 
to this Church in the United States, and 
that we have been preserved and estab-= 
lished so solidly that we are in no dan- 
ger of being removed. The kingdom 
will remain with this people, and not 
with any other. Many have, gone out 
from *n£>ng us. Among them have 
been men holding great and important 
authority, nearly as great as there has 
been in the Church— even the counsel- 
ors of the Prophet Joseph. He could 
hardly get a man that would be true 
to him, aside from his brother Hyrum. 
They fell one by one, until every coun- 
selor that he ever had departed from 
his side. But he was true and faithful 
to the end, and, like our Redeemer, he 
almost trod the wine-press alone. There 
were falfe brethren in those, days, much 
more than today. Though the Church 
was on'y few in numbers at that time, 
false brethren were many. Now look 
over the Church today; can you find 
a Bishop, a Bishop's counselor, a presi- 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



11 



dent of Stake or his counselor, or a 
High Councilor, can you find a Presi- 
dent of Seventy, can you find a pre- 
siding authority in any mission of the 
world, or any branch of this Church, 
that is not true to the faith? There are 
individuals occasionally who show that 
they have received a bad spirit, b> 
which they are led astray, but you will 
find that every President of a Stake 
and every Bishop of a Ward knows just 
exactly how to take care of the flock. 
They are trained, they are inspired, 
they are established, and they have the 
same testimony turning in their hearts 
that burns in the hearts of President 
Joseph F. Smith, his counselors and the 
Twelve. I wanted to draw the atten- 
tion of the conference to this fact, for 
there are representatives here from al- 
most every Stake and Ward in Zion 
You all know that what I say is true. 

When missionaries go out among the 
Latter-day Saints, they find that th<. 
people are so thoroughly trained ana 
exrerienced in the doctrines of tht 
Gospel that they are not easily deceived 
or blinded. The work is so established 
and so thoroughly fixed upon the earth 
that it will endure. You will find the 
Latter-day Saints just as true as their 
leaders; for they have the same spirit 
and the same testimony burning in 
their hearts. These Pre=idenis of 
Stakes, these presidents of cju'rums.ana 
these men who stand at the head ot 
the wards and the missions at home or 
abroad, are filled with the same in- 
spiration of the Lord. They know 
the voice of the true shepherd and 
they do not know the voice of stran- 
gers, and they will not follow them, but 
they will follow and listen to the true 
Shepherd. That is my testimony to 
you, and J thank the Lord th",i it burns 
in my heart as it does in yours. Blessed 
be those who are fortunate enough to 
mfintain their standing and their fel- 
lowship in this Church, for this is the 
Church of Christ. It is not the Church 
of the. Prophet Joseph, it is not the 
Church of any of his successors, or of 
those that may succeed hereafter, but, 



it is the Church of Jesus Christ: He 
has established it, and He will preserve, 
it among the children of men. Right- 
eousness shall be cultivated among this 
people; corruption and wickedness will 
not be tolerated. 

Speaking of the experience of the 
Prophet Joseph in the early days, I 
want to say that though there were 
many who turned from him, yet he had 
true and devoted friends, who stood 
by his side and sustained him to the 
very last; and he rolled upon their 
shoulders the cause of the kingdom.and 
they have been true to that trust. This 
Church has been taken care of from 
that time to this, and these, men have 
walked in the footsteps of their tile 
leaders, in the footsteps of the Prophet 
Joseph, and they have bui.'t upon the 
foundations which he laid. They have 
magnified the doctrines that he taught, 
have sent them to the world, have ad- 
vocated the.m, lived by them, and de- 
fended them in the earth;and the fruits 
are seen throughout this mountain 
country, where the Prophet Joseph saw 
by vision that this people would be es- 
tablished. He so announced it, and 
was prepared himself to lead the 
Church into this very location if his life 
had not been taken; but in the Prophet 
Bri°ham he found a devout, faithful 
and competent successor. The Church 
has been established and stands today 
on foundations that shall never be 
shaken. It is true and faithful. It is 
the Lord's and He will take- care of it, 
if you and I will only take care of our- 
selves and be sure that we are faith- 
ful and true, and that we are not de- 
ceived nor darkened in our minds. 

God bless you and all Israel, our 
neighbors, our friends, and all that love 
truth, righteousness and justice, I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 
We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet, 
To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank thee for sending the Gospel, 
To lighten our minds with its rays. 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der Seymour B. Young.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference convened at 2 p. m. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word! 

What more can He say than to you He 

hath said — 
Tou who unto Jesus for refuge have 

fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder Nathan- 
iel Smith. 

The choir sang the anthem, "From 
afar, gracious Lord, Thou hast gather- 
ed Thy flock." 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

The work of God cannot be overthrown.— 
Unselfish devotion of the ministers of 
the Gospel. — The rights of all niank'nd 
guarded by the Church. — Heroic char- 
acter of the Church leaders. 

I am pleased »with the privilege of be- 
ing with you in the commencement of 
this conference. At the April conference 
I had been absent in Mexico and did not 
reach here until the last session. One 
year ago I was considerably "under 
the weather" and did not have part 
with you in the conference at that time. 
It has been a pleasure to me this morn- 
ing to hear the songs of Zion, and lis- 
ten to the voices of our brethren in in- 
structions, reporting the conditions at- 
tendant upon the labors of the elders 
of the church, and in the testimonies 
that have been borne concerning your 
fidelity and faith in the work that our 
Father has established in the w r orld, 
with the promise that it should never ba 
thrown down nor given to another peo- 
ple. That promise has found lodgment, 
I believe, in your hearts and has re- 
mained with you in the midst of many 
trying experiences, and will in the fu- 
tue remain, imparting hope and 
strength which shall cause you to pos- 
sess the fortitude and faith necessary 
to fulfill the missions whereunto you 
have been called by the Almighty. To 
me, it is ever a joy to remember those 
memorable words, and wherever I have 
found myself, w r hether at home or 
abroad, whether in your companion- 
ship, under the sound of your voices, 
or in the association and companion- 



ship of men of the world, the same joy 
and satisfaction has welled up in my 
soul as the remembrance of these words 
has come up in my mind. The Latter- 
day Saints have no cause for concern 
so far as the work itself is concerned. 
It is a heritage of the Lord. It has been 
sent into the world to fulfill a great 
purpose, and they to whom the mes- 
sage of glad tidings has come are under 
the obligation to fulfill their part to the 
best of their ability, based upon the re- 
quirement that he who is warned shall 
warn his neighbor. In this connection 
we remember that there are few men 
in this congregation but what have 
performed this sacred duty with fidelity 
and faith. Consigning their families to 
the mercies of the Lord, they have 
entered the field, in almost every land 
and clime, and have sought to free 
themselves from that responsibility 
which attaches to the acceptance of the 
Gospel, in heralding the same among 
their fellow creatures, that wdien they 
stand at the bar of the Great Judge 
and the books are opened, and they are 
judged out of the books from the things 
written therein, it will be found that in 
fulfillment of the sacred obligation and 
the discharge of this requirement, their 
names are registered there, and that fi- 
delity and faith, the love of our Father 
and of His children, characterized their 
lives. To this end, the gray-haired ones 
who sit under the sound of my voice 
upon this occasion have ministered 
with that determination, that patriot- 
ism, and that love that only a love of 
the Supreme Being and an absolute be- 
lief in the sacred mission entrusted to 
their care could cause them to exhibit. 
When I look upon the faces of these 
mothers and these wives who are con- 
gregated here today, I remember too, 
that they have been in no degree less 
heroic, or less lacking in that abiding 
faith, and that undying determination in 
connection 'with the work to which they 
have been called along with their hus- 
bands, fathers or brothers. They also 
have regarded it as among the sacred 
heritages of the human race, and it has 
been their determination that while 
husband or father was in the field car-

rying the glad tidings of great joy to 
the children of men, their homes and 
their firesides should be guarded from 
the attacks of the enemy, and their 
children should be nurtured in the 
faith which is dear to themselves. And 
while, perchance, in some instances", 
these children may not have been as 
fully equipped in the faith as they 
should be, as has been intimated in the 
remarks of presiding brethren this 
morning, the responses that have been 
made by the younger members of the 
church bear witness to the heroism of 
their mothers, the faith of their fath- 
ers, and the honesty and Integrity pos- 
sessed by themselves. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice to 
be numbered with a people such as you 
are. I rejoice to recognize the fact that 
you have come from many lands and 
dimes, and that you abandoned those 
lands for the sake of the truth. I have 
pleasure in the fact that it has been 
my privilege, in connection with my 
brethren, to meet you in those lands, 
to bear witness of the restoration of 
the gospel in its fullness and purity, to 
declared that the Prophet of this latter- 
day dispensation did gaze upon the face 
of the Father and the Son; and we bear 
that witness in harmony with the dec- 
laration that went forth in a former 
day that an angel of the Lord should 
fly through the midst of heaven having 
the Everlasting Gospel to preach ta 
them.' that dwell upon the earth, to 
every nal ion, to every kindred, to every 
tongue, and to every people. I have re- 
joiced in the faithfulness you have dis- 
played in the fulfillment of your sacred 
duty in the receipt of that warning, 
in the carrying of these glad tidings, 
and in meeting the obligation in the 
manly and womanly way in which it 
has been done by the heroes and hero- 
ines who have builded these western 
commonwealths and have confronted 
the trials and tribulations incident to 
the establishment of homes and the 
upbuilding of many sections of our 
land. As I look upon the faces of men 
who are sitting before me, I see those 
who have sacrificed every interest in 
the world for the cause which to their 



hearts was most dear, and I recognize 
that in their doing this, it was not to 
please President Young, it was not to 
please President John Taylor, it was 
not to please President Wilford Wood- 
ruff, it was not to please Pres- 
ident Lorenzo Enow, it was not 
to please President Joseph F. 
Smith and his associaties. but 
it was to satisfy their own consciences 
and to serve that Being who called 
them by the voice of His Spirit to an 
understanding of the truth, and had 
written it in their souls that the most 
sacred duty which mortal could dis- 
charge was to live and minister for 
the reclamation of the human race, to 
establish in them faith and an under- 
standing of the gospel, and to minister 
in the temporal concerns of this life, 
that' their fellows might possess the 
blessings and comforts of the present 
and have joy and satisfaction therein. 

The gospel we 'have embraced is the 
truth. It came from the Master. It 
has been sent to renovate the world, 
to re-establish among mankind the liv- 
ing faith which had so largely depart- 
ed from the breasts of the human fam- 
ily, and to bring them to a comprenen- 
sion of the responsibilities they owe 
to the Divine Master. Nothing can 
stay its progress. You and I may fall 
by the wayside; we may lack the for- 
titude and faith to endure and fulfill 
our part; but the work itself has gone 
on from the day the announcement was 
made of the administration of heavenly 
beings, and it will continue in its on- 
ward march until every nation, kindred, 
tongue, and people throughout the uni- 
verse shall hear the glad tidings of 
great joy and have the privilege of ac- 
cepting or rejecting the same in the ex- 
ercise of the agency our Father has 
given to them. I trust, that in the ful- 
fillment of our duties, in the discharge 
of the great obligations that are ours, 
our hearts and minds "will never waver. 
It can never be anticipated that this 
work shall be made popular with 
the human family at large. It can 
not be expected that its mission 
will be accomplished without op- 
position. It must meet adverse 
elements, it must overcome obstacles.

it must secure the ground step by 
step, without fear and without favor, 
honoring- our heavenly Father, and 
maintaining the dignity of that Priest- 
hood God has given to us — the grandest 
heritage that was ever given to the 
children of men in any day and age of 
the world. 

I pray that the blessings of the Gos- 
pel may abound with you in the future 
as in the past; that, true to the obli- 
gations that are yours, in every place 
and in every station, among all men, no 
matter who or where they may be, you 
may know where you stand, and, know- 
ing where you stand, you may have the 
faith and the fortitude to express your 
views and your sentiments. It has been 
my experience thus far in life that 
there is nothing in connection with this 
work for which any man in the world 
need blush. There has been no revela- 
tion given to the Prophet for which we 
should have the least feeling of regret 
or concern. There is nothing within 
these statute books given by our heav- 
enly Father for which I, as one of His 
sons, need blush. On the contrary, I 
honor Him for giving the same, and 
purpose in the fulfillment of life's mis- 
sion, if He will give me faith and for- 
titude so to do, to raise my voice in 
their defense, and to stand for the ad- 
vancement and spreading of this work, 
as I know it came from Him. The 
same is true not only in regard to our 
membership in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, but it is 
true in regard to our citizenship in the 
republic of the United States. No man 
of standing in this Church has ever 
in my presence given utterance to a 
word that would cause me, in any sense 
of the word, to be ashamed of my citi- 
zenship in this glorious land; on the 
contrary, the sentiment and fejeling 
that has ever come from the lips of the 
men with whom it has been my priv- 
ilege to mingle has been to preserve our 
constitutional liberties, and accord the 
same rights to every other man, wheth- 
er he be Jew, Pagan, Christian, Mo- 
hammedan, or infidel. So long as he in- 
terferes not with the rights and liber- 
ties of other men, his liberties should 



be guarded, his rights should be pre- 
served, and he should be honored irt the 
exercise thereof, and his rights main- 
tained justly and properly. Standing 
before you with these sentiments in 
my heart, I trust that we will continue 
to maintain the highest citizenship it 
is possible for mortals to do; and that 
we shall stand for our own liberties, 
that we shall maintain them to the 
best of our ability, be subservient to 
every principle that is right, and con- 
cede nothing that is wrong, but stand 
by the truth, honoring the Lord, fulfill- 
ing our obligations, preaching the prin- 
ciples of righteousness to the children 
of men, and pointing the way of life 
to every man in whose company it may 
be our privilege to come. 

I bear you my testimony to the truth 
of the Gospel, and the mission of Jos- 
eph Smith; to the mission of his asso- 
ciates that stood around him and were 
true to him; to the mission of Brig- 
ham Young, who was faithful, earnest, 
devoted and of a heroic mold, and who, 
had he not been of such type, would 
have failed in the great mission that 
was given to him; honoring and es- 
teeming in his life's ministry that he- 
roic man whose blood mingled with the 
prophet in Cathage jail, John Taylor; 
true to that humble and earnest advo- 
cate of the principles of the gospel, 
one of the most successful that ever 
preached it in the world, Wilford Wood- 
ruff; and to that upright man of the 
Lord, Lorenzo Snow, who presided in 
righteousness over this people. And I 
will not in any degree slacken in my 
allegiance and respect for the man who 
stands at our head today. No truer 
man ever breathed the breath of life. 
No man has ever been more willing to 
stand up for the principles of justice 
and mercy. No man has been more ioy- 
al in preaching the principles of his 
faith. No man is more ready today to 
discharge that high responsibility and 
fulfill every obligation- Sitting by his 
side are those who, commencing in 
their boyhood, have ministered in the 
interests of this work, and who have 
never faltered nor turned their back 
upon the truth in any place or station.

Such has been the character of the he- 
roic men who laid the foundations of 
these commonwealths. Such 'is the 
character of the men who stand at the 
head of these Stakes and Wards, and 
of the Seventies and Elders who have 
carried this gospel to the nations, and 
also of the mothers who have guarded 
their hearthstones and taught their 
children in the principles of eternal 
life. I bear my witness to this work. 
I know that it is from the Lord, that 
it has come to stay, that it will con- 
tinue to spread and increase in the 
world, and that it will become the joy 
of the whole earth. May God bless you 
with faith and fill you with under- 
standing; may we be loyal to ourselves 
and to our heavenly Father, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Great responsibilities on those who re- 
ceive God's commandments. — The procla- 
mation of the Gospel. — Building up of 
Zion. 

Brethren and sisters, I have very 
much rejoiced in the spirit of the con- 
ference. I listened with deep interest to 
the testimonies of the First Presidency 
and the President of the Twelve at the 
meeting this morning. I felt that it 
was a most auspicious opening of our 
conference, and the congregation which 
was assembled will judge as to whether 
they spoke by the Spirit of God, or by 
some other spirit. I am sure that their 
words found a response in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints. We not only 
have with us, brethren and sisters, the 
living oracles, but we also have the 
Holy Scriptures, which embody the 
commandments of God to His people 
and to the children of men. In every 
age of the world when the Lord has 
given a commandment to men, it has 
always been accompanied by a heavy 
weight of responsibility. We have ex- 
amples of this from the beginning. You 
remember that Moses went by instruc- 
tion into the mount and communed with 



the Almighty; he was gone forty days 
and forty nights. While there he receiv- 
ed from the hand of God the Ten Com- 
mandments. And with these tables of 
stone that were intrusted to him came a 
very great responsibility — a double re- 
sponsibility, you might say. In the 
first place Moses was required to de- 
liver these commandments to the chil- 
dren of Israel. Now, if he had taken 
them to his tent, dug a hole in the 
earth and hidden them out of sight, he 
would have stood condemned before the 
Lord; but we learn that Moses, the 
law-giver, discharged his duty faith- 
fully and well, for he brought the com- 
mandments to the children of Israel. A 
heavy weight of responsibility rested 
upon the people with reference to these 
commandments, as to their attitude and 
the manner in which they should treat 
them. If they failed to obey the com- 
mandments, they would be answerable 
to the Lord and would have to give an 
accounting to Him in the day of 
judgment. For those commandments 
were not only binding upon Moses, but 
they were binding upon the whole peo- 
ple; not. only upon the children of Isra- 
el, but upon the entire world. There- 
fore, it was necessary that they should 
go to the world. We have another strik- 
ing example in the day of the Savior 
when He said to His disciples: "Go ye 
into all the world and preach the gos- 
pel to every creature." You will ob- 
serve that no exception was made, but 
this message was to go to every crea- 
ture. "He that believeth and is bap- 
tized shall be saved, and he that be- 
lieveth not shall be damned." With 
this commandment from the Messiah 
to His disciples came a heavy respon- 
sibility — a double responsibility. In the 
first place, they were required not to 
conceal this message, not to keep it 
back, not to hold it for themselves and 
for their immediate family and friends; 
but the message of the gospel was to 
go to the entire world, and if they fail- 
ed to discharge that duty they were 
under a very serious obligation be- 
fore the Lord, and they would have to 
account to Him for it, and perchance 
the blood of that generation would

have been found upon their skirts. But 
we learn from the Scriptures that they 
discharged this duty ifaithfully land 
well, as did Moses before them, for 
they carried the gospel in all humility 
and in faith and power to the world. 
The moment they did this a very great 
responsibility rested upon the children 
of men, as to whether they regarded 
the message as being divine, and 
whether they would accept it and be 
governed by the spirit thereof, and 
avail themselves of the opportunity and 
the mercy of the Lord, and thus obtain 
salvation; otherwise they would stand 
condemned before the Lord. 

So it has been, brethren and sisters, 
in our day and time. Joseph Smith, 
the prophet, received revelation, not 
only by the personal visitation of the 
Father and the Son, but also in the 
written word. Furthermore, Joseph 
Smith received the authority of the 
apostleship and priesthood under the 
hands of Peter, James and John, and 
also under the hands, of John the Bap- 
tist, by which the Melchisedek and the 
Aaronic priesthoods were restored to 
the earth. With the restoration of this 
authority there came to Joseph Smith 
a very heavy responsibility. He could 
not be justified for a moment in keep- 
ing the information from the world. He 
could not hide it away. He could not 
call around him his immediate family 
and friends and indicate to them only 
what the Lord had done, but he must 
bear the message to the whole world. 
Growing out of that responsibility, 
there has been established in the church 
a vast system for proselyting, which 
has continued to this day, running 
down through >:he years. Elders from 
this church have been continually sent 
into the field to preach the Gospel, num- 
bering as high as two thousand at a 
time. I think that there is now about 
twelve hundred in the mission field. I 
leave you, brethren and sisters, to 
judge whether any degree of responsi- 
bility comes with the invitation of the 
First Presidency of this Church to your 
sons to go forth and proclaim the gos- 
pel message, which came first to Jos- 
eph Smith, the prophet. Mark these 



words that will be found in section 84 
of the book of Doctrine & Covenants. 
Speaking of the early Elders who were 
sent out to preach the gospel (and you 
will perceive also that the, language 
applies to Elders of our day and time) 
the Lord says: 

Behold, I send you out to reprove the 
world of all their unrighteous deeds, 
and to teach them of a judgment which 
is to come. And whoso receiveth you, 
there I will be also, for I will go before 
your face: I will be on your right hand 
and on your left, and my Spirit shall 
be in your hearts, and mine angels 
round about you, to bear you up. 

Whoso receiveth you receiveth me, 
and the same will feed you, and clothe 
you, and give you money. 

And he who feeds you, or clothes you, 
or gives you money, shall in no wise 
lose his reward; 

And he that doeth not these things 
is not my disciple; by this you may 
know my disciples. 

He that receiveth you not, go away 
from him alone by yourselves, and 
cleanse your feet even with water, pure 
water, whether in heat or in cold, and 
bear testimony of it unto your Father 
which is in heaven, and return not 
again unto that man. 

And in whatsoever village or city ye 
enter, do likewise. 

Nevertheless, search diligently and 
spare not: and wo unto that house, or 
that village or city that rejecteth you,' 
or your words, or your testimony con- 
cerning me. 

Wo, I say again, unto that house, or 
that village or city that rejecteth you, 
or your words, or your testimonies. 

In Section 75 it is said: "And it shall 
be more tolerable for the heathen in the. 
day of judgment than for that house. 
Therefore, gird up your loins and be 
faithful, and ye shall overcome all 
things ar.d be lifted up at the last day." 

You will perceive that this invitation 
•which comes to the young men of Is- 
rael to go forth and bear this gospel 
message, carries with it a heavy weight 
of responsibility, first with the Elders 
themselves, for if they reject the invi- 
tation, if they turn away from . the 
voice of the priesthood, which is the 
voice of God. if they refuse to perforrn 
this obligation, it may be that the blood 
of this generation will be found upon 
their skirts. On the other hand, if they 
discharge this duty faithfully and well, 
you perceive that there is a heavy 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



17 



weight of responsibility resting upon 
the people of the world who hear this 
message, though it may come to them 
in a humble manner, by those who may 
possibly be unlearned or inexperienced, 
and who bring it to their doors, from 
house to house, and, as the revelation 
says, from city to city. If they reject 
it, God will hold them to a strict ac- 
counting and, as He has said by His 
own voice, " it will be more tolerable fojj 
the heathen in the day of judgment 
than for that house or that city." 

But I remind you, brethren and sis-> 
ters, that this responsibility of preach- 
ing the gospel to the world is not all. 
It does not fully cover the ground, be- 
cause there is a responsibility resting 
upon the Elders of Israel with refer- 
ence to the building up of Zion; for, as 
the Lord says, every heart shall be 
pierced, and every ear shall hear. This 
message of life and salvation, too, must 
not only go to the strangers and to 
people who have never heard ft in the 
world, but it must also go to the chil- 
dren of Zion, to your children and to 
my children. They must be taught and 
warned. You will remember what the 
Lord said to the prophet Ezekiel along 
this line: 

Son of man, I have made thee a 
watchman unto the house of Israel; 
therefore hear the word at my mouth, 
and give them warning from me. 

When I say unto the wicked, Thou 
shalt surely die; and thou givest him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn the. 
wicked from his wicked way, to save 
his life; the same wicked man shall 
die in his iniquity; but his blood will 
I require at thine hand. 

Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he 
turn not from his wickedness, nor from 
his wicked way, he shall die in his In- 
iquity; but thou hast delivered thy 
sou!. 

Again, when a righteous man doth 
turn from his righteousness, and com- 
mit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling 
block befdre him, he shall die: because 
thou hast not given him warning, h§ 
shall die in his sin, and his righteous- 
ness which he hath done shall not be 
remembered; but his blood will I re- 
quire at thine hand. 

Nevertheless if thou warn the right- 
eous- man, that the righteous sin 
not, and he doth not sin, he shall sure- 
ly live, because he is warned; also thou 
hast delivered thy soul. 
2 



That is the attitude, brethren and sis- 
ters, which the authorities of this 
church, the High Priests, Seventies and 
Eiders, and the authorities of the les- 
ser priesthood, bear toward this peo- 
ple; They are called to be watchmen 
upon the towers of Zion, and to give 
notice and warning, to point out the 
evil before it comes, and to guard the 
young against danger. What must we 
think when we learn that there are 
many who bear the sacred authority of 
the holy priesthood, who are careless 
and indifferent, and who fail to mag- 
nify this authority and to carry the 
message to the people? Will not the 
displeasure of the Lord be upon them? 
Will not this thing be required at their 
hands? Will they not have to give a 
strict account of the priesthood and 
power which they have received from 
the heavens? This responsibility has 
been passed from the shoulders of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and now rests 
down upon the Elders of Israel who 
have succeeded him, and who are on the 
scene of action. The Lord says to His 
servants: "Behold, how great is your 
calling; cleanse your hearts and your 
garments, lest the blood of this gener- 
ation be required at your hands." I 
think that passage will be found in sec- 
tion one hundred and twelve. It is 
the strict injunction of the Lord. 

I rejoice in the gospel, in the author- 
ity of the holy priesthood, and in the 
power that is manifested by this people 
in carrying out the great purposes of 
Jehovah. The work will stand, and the 
will of the Lord be accomplished, as we 
have heard it from the Presidency of 
the Church and those who have spoken. 
I testify to this, in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

gation of Latter-day Saints, and ex- 
pressing to them, in the few moments 
I have at my command, some of the 
thoughts that have passed through my 
mind during this conference. I am 
indeed thankful for my standing in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I am indeed thankful for the 
position occupied today in the world's 
affairs by the Church and by the peo • 
pie; and "I am not ashamed of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, for it 
is the power of God unto salvation." I 
believe with all my soul, and with all 
the understanding that God has given 
me. that this is His work, and that it 
is designed to redeem the earth, to 
bring light unto its inhabitants, to 
make people better, and to ma\e this 
planet a fit place for the second corn- 
ing of the Lord and Master. 

I have had a great deal of pleasure 
in visiting the different parts of our 
state, mingling with the people, seeing 
the conditions surrounding tuem. and 
noting their loyalty to the work of 
God. Brother John Henry Smith, in 
speaking of the loyalty of the gray- 
haired men and women before him, 
touched my heart. I also say that, not 
only are they loyal to this work, but, 
if I am any judge, the young people 
are just as loyal to the authorities and 
to the institutions of the Church as 
were our fathers in the past, and as 
they are today. Our brethren have 
been testifying to the loyalty which is 
manifest in our church towards the 
authorities, and especially towards the 
presidency. I feel like testifying to 
you. and to all. that this great work 
of God is in the hands of honest, up- 
right. God-fearing men. Assaults are 
made upon us from all sides. Many 
claim that they are not assailing the 
"Mormon" people, nor the principles of 
the Gospel which they believe, but it is 
the leaders they are condemning mid 
finding fault with. They are also try- 
ing to bring distrust of the authorities 
into the minds of the Latter-da* 
Saints. Why are they assailing tne 
principle of tithing? Why are they 
trying to make you believe that every 
cent paid by you, for the forwarding 



of God's work upon this earth, is being 
handled by dishonest men and being 
spent, not for the work Uself, but for 
the aggrandizement and personal bene- 
fit of men? If I had the uower to reach 
the heart of every honest Latter- 
day Saint, and if I had the confi- 
dence of every soul that heart my 
voice, I would testify to this fact, that, 
as far as the tithing of the Church is 
concerned, not one farthing is spent 
wrongfully, or is diverted from the 
channel in which it was intended to be 
used. O, how natural it is for our op- 
ponents to try to advance some argu- 
ment that may bring distrust into the 
minds of people, and cause apostasy 
in our midst. They think they have 
found a condemning argument in the 
collec$ft>n and use of tithing, and, in 
calling attention to it, they rely on the 
appeals they make to the selfishness of 
the people. But the evil one today 
plainly sees and knows as well as, or 
perhaps *better than, we do, that this 
great work of God is moving on, spread- 
ing in foreign lands, and reaching to 
the farthest ends of the world. It is 
therefore natural for his emissaries to 
cry "fraud, fraud." We. are informed 
that the Church is building meeting- 
houses and establishing headquarters 
upon the islands of the sea, and in all 
the great countries of Europe. Re- 
spectable, places of worship, and homes 
for presidents of missions, are also be- 
ing established in some of the. principal 
cities of our great country. The Devi! 
sees these things going on, and he 
knows there must be something done 
to retard the work if possible, and in- 
citing the. cry of "fraud, fraud," is one 
way he has of attacking it. He thinks 
by this to bring distrust into the minds 
of the people; but he will fail in this 
just as sure as the sun will rise to- 
morrow morning. I believe that the 
Latter-day Saints, who have the Spirit 
of God in them, never had more con- 
fidence in a man, or set of men, than 
they have in the presidency of the 
Church today. I wish that every one 
could read the heart and understand the 
thoughts of the presidency, and all 
others who are trying, in their humble

way, to lead and direct the affairs of 
this people. I feel that if it were pos- 
sible for you to do so, you would not 
only love them as you have in the past, 
but you would have for them still 
greater love; and the confidence you 
would have in them would be such that 
you could pray for them with all your 
soul, and uphold them, and ask the 
blessings of God urion them in the 
important work they are trying to ac- 
complish in this dispensation. 

Some people think, as I have heard 
it expressed, inspired from the source 
of all misrepresentation and falsehood, 
that the. president of the Church does 
not work, and that he and his counsel- 
ors do not give the attention they 
should to the work of the Lord. I 
wish that these men had more physical 
strength than they have, for I testify 
to you that it is strained to 
the utmost. I go into their of- 
fice and I see almost an arm full or 
mail brought in several times a 
day. 1 find President Winder, eighty- 
three years old, reading aloud almost 
every letter, and, with the President 
of the Church, and the other counselor, 
attending to every little detail that is 
brought to their notice from all parts of 
this great Church. While speaking up- 
on this subject, I feel to ask the breth- 
ren here, who hold leading positions in 
the Church, as well as all members 
in the different stakes of Zion who write 
letters to the presidency, if it is abso- 
lutely necessary for you to write, make 
the letters as short as you can, but do 
not write unless it is necessary. I 
would advise the people to first go to 
their Bishop, and, if possible, get from 
him the advice and counsel they need; 
if unable to get it from him, then ap- 
ply to the presidency of the stake, and, 
if it becomes absolutely necessary to 
appeal to the First Presidency.make the 
communication just as short as possi- 
ble, for those brethren are worked al- 
most to death. I feel like asking the 
good people of the Church to bear this 
in mind when they are tempted to 
write long letters to the Presidency. 
I have absolute confidence in the ma- 



jority of the young people of the Church 
and in their understanding of the truth 
of the Gospel. Being born in the Cove- 
nant and reared among the Saints, I 
have absolute confidence that they are 
net going to be tricked or turned aside 
by misrepresentations. I feel that, when 
fthey stop to consider and compare 
things as they are today with condition? 
of the past, they will be led to say 
that, as far as they are concerned, they 
will be loyal and true to the fathers and 
mothers who gave them birth. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope you 
will never be discouraged, and never 
feel that God is going to abandon this 
people, for He never will as long as we 
are prayerful and feel in our souls to 
do His will, according to the wisdom 
and light He has given us. I have 
thought a great deal lately of the his- 
tory of the Church, and I have won- 
dered sometimes whether our position 
as a people is any different today than 
it has been from the beginning of the. 
Church. As I study the history of the 
people, I find that it is about the same 
as it always has been, with but few ex- 
ceptions. Whenever there is a great 
advance, and when the evil one sees the 
Church progressing a little more rapid- 
ly than usual, it arouses him to greater 
action. I read here the word of the 
Lord to Joseph the Prophet, while he 
was in Liberty Jail, Clay County, Mis- 
souri, March, 1839. At that time pros- 
pects looked very black to him. He, the 
Prophet of God, was being hounded on 
every hand, and every kind of a charge 
being made against him. His heart was 
heavy. He was pondering how it was 
that these things should come to a man 
who was trying to serve the good Mas- 
ter, and while in that condition of mind 
the Lord gave unto him these words: 

"And if thou shouldst be cast into 
the pit, or into the hands of murderers, 
and the sentence of death passed upon 
thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if 
the billowing surge conspire against 
thee; if fierce winds become thine en- 
emy; if the heavens gather blackness 
and all the elements combine to hedge 
up the way; and above all, if the very 



20

jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth 
wide after thee, know thou, my son, 
that all these things shall give thee ex- 
perience, and shall be for thy good." 

I believe with all my heart that our 
trials are given us for the same pur- 
pose. We are to be a tried people. "We 
are to be thrice tried, as the Saints of 
old. I believe that all trials are given 
to us for experience, just as the Lord 
permitted them to be given to Joseph 
in the early days of the church. At 
this same time the Lord said to him, 
"Thy people shall never be turned 
against thee by the testimony of trait- 
ors." I say to you, President Joseph F. 
Smith, that the Saints in this vast con- 
gregation (and they are but representa- 
tive of the communities in which they 
live) will never turn against thee by 
the testimony of traitors. 

My brethren and sisters, all I care 
for is that we may live as God wants 
us to live, observing all the require- 
ments made of us, and performing the 
duty that is incumbent upon us, then 
all will be well, as sure as He has 
spoken from the heavens. As I travel 
among the people and see the feeling of 
loyalty and truth existing, I feel in my 
soul to say, God bless the Latter-day 
Saints in all their interests, in their 
basket and in their store. God bless 
them with strong testimony, that they 
may know the voice of the true shep- 
herd. I feel in my soul that they will 
know it. No matter what transpires, 
or who may come in our midst think- 
ing there will be a falling away from 
the Church, and that they may succeed 
in gathering in the lost ones. I say 
there never was a time when the peo- 
ple testified with more fervency, and 
with a deeper feeling of love for our 
heavenly Father and His work, than 
they do at the present moment. I 
bear my testimony to you that this 
work is the work of God, and He will 
make it triumphant in the end; we will 
love it, and be loyal to it, and its infer- 
ests; and we will be loyal to every in- 
stitution upon the earth that has for 
its object the advancement of mankind. 
We will continue to be good citizens of 



this nation; we will uphold and pray 
for it. We will be true men and tru<* 
women to our Church, to our country, 
and to our God. May God bless you, I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER HTRUM M. SMITH. 

Magnitude of the work of God.— Abundant 
opportunities to acquire knowledge.— 
Reasons for diligence and faithfulness.— 
Respect for local authorities. 

My brothers and sisters, I greatly de- 
sire that you shall accord me the same 
attention you have extended to my 
brethren who have spoken already, and 
that you will assist me by your prayers, 
that in bearing testimony to the truth 
of the everlasting Gospel I may do so 
under the inspiration of the Spirit of 
the Lord. The Latter-day Saints cer- 
tainly have wonderfully good times 
when they gather in their general con- 
ferences. They never fail to come to- 
gether in the spirit of prayer and with 
a great desire in their hearts that the 
Lord will have something to say to 
them through His servants who shall 
speak; and when they come together in 
this spirit they never fail to receive 
the word of the Lord, that word which 
fills their souls with joy and thanks- 
giving, and which allays any doubt 
that may have found lodgment in their 
minds. They never fail to be built 
up and strengthened, and they go home 
after the conference is over, feeling that 
the Lord is with His people. 

Now, the thing that is on my mind 
this afternoon is the greatness of the 
work which has been introduced into 
the world in this day and age through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. We meet 
together here in vast numbers, and yet 
though all the Latter-day Saints were 
met together they would only be a 
hand-full compared to the multitudes of 
people that dwell in the earth. We 
have been highly favored of the Lord, 
in that He has sent His servants unto- 
us with the word of truth and of reve- 
lation, and He has put it into our 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



21 



hearts to receive that word and to ob- 
tain a testimony of the truth of the 
revelation which He has given to the 
world. We younger ones, the young 
men and the young women of Israel, 
who have been so highly favored as to 
be born in the Church, having the testi- 
mony of the truth born in us and hav- 
ing the seed of truth grow and develop 
within us, most assuredly ought to feel 
thankfulness to our Father in heaven 
for it. The whole world still lieth in 
darkness. "This Gospel of the King- 
dom must be preached in all the world 
as a witness before the end shall come." 
The angel who introduced this Gospel 
came with it that it might be preached 
to every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people. And while we are doing a great 
deal towards the carrying of the mes- 
sage unto the nations of the earth, 
still the progress we are making, when 
we consider the vast amount of work 
that must be done, is only small, and 
we have only advanced a little way. 

I believe all that has been said ot 
the Latter-day Saints by our brethren 
who have spoken. I believe they are 
the children of God, and that they 
have the testimony of the truth burning 
within their souls. I believe they love 
the truth and desire to keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord. Yet I am 
constrained to believe they still need 
more labor among them every day than 
ought to be necessary. I believe that 
they should be firmly founded in the 
knowledge of the truth, by reason of 
the great blessings the Lord has be- 
stowed upon them, and the great means 
He has placed in their way whereby 
they may learn of Him. They have 
the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, which 
contains the word of God; the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and the Pearl of Great Price; they have 
the Journal of Discourses; also period- 
icals, books and papers which are pub- 
lished from time to time containing the 
discourses and inspired words of the 
servants of the Lord. All these they 
have, and all they need do, if they have 
the desire, is to open the books and 
there read the word of the Lord. In 
addition to this it seems essential that 



the Twelve and the Seven Presidents 
of the Seventies shall visit the various 
Stakes of Zion and spend all their time, 
month after month, year after year, 
exhorting the Saints to faithfulness.re- 
proving them at times for wickedness 
and folly, laboring to keep them, 
as it were, to the line and from 
departing by degrees from their full 
duty. Now this is what I think ought 
not to be. I think that the Saints ought 
to know the truth as well as the ser- 
vants of the Lord. They ought to be' 
as firmly grounded in the faith. It 
ought to be jast as impossible to move 
them from the truth as it is to move 
the men who stand at the head of the 
Church; and the time of the Twelve, 
and that of the Seventies (who labor 
among thf. members holding the Priest- 
hood of Seventy) might be given to 
these hundreds of millions of people 
who still dwell in the world without a 
knowledge of the truth. I am con- 
strained to believe that if the same 
amount of inspired preaching of the 
word of the Lord that is done among 
the Saints were done in the world, 
thousands and tens of thousands of 
honest souls who are now in the world 
might be brought to the knowledge of 
the true Gospel, and they might gather 
with the Saints and enjoy the blessings 
of the house of the Lord, and there 
labor for their own salvation and for 
the redemption of their dead. We 
ought to rely a little more than we 
do upon the Lord and upon the intel- 
ligence He has given us to develop the 
light within us, to become better in- 
formed, to be more faithful than w& 
are, notwithstanding good testimony of 
our faithfulness may be borne now. 
My brethren and sisters, there is no 
reason in the world why the Saints 
should not keep the commandments of 
the Lord, there is no reason why they 
need fail to do their duty towards the 
Lord and towards their fellow men. 
Surely, the Lord has held out the hand 
of fellowship to us. Truly, He has not 
withheld when we have asked Him. 
He has fulfilled on our heads the prom- 
ise that if we will ask of Him He will 
give freely unto us, whether it be wis-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



dom, or the necessaries of lifei, or in- 
telligence, or knowledge, no matter 
what it be, if it is for our good and 
for the good of the children of men. He> 
has not withheld it from us. All 
things, it would seem, that the Latter- 
day Saints could possibly desire, the 
Lord has given freely. We ought to 
be His people. We ought to hang on 
firmly and steadfastly to the truth. 
Great will be the condemnation of the 
Saints if they fail to remain faithful 
after all that the Lord has done for 
them. A season has just passed that 
has been wonderfully prosperous and 
bounteous to the Saints; prosperity 
abounds on every hand temporally, and 
the Spirit of the Lord is being poured 
out in great abundance. Prophecy, 
revelation and the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost are also enjoyed by them. All 
these things the Lord has done for us. 
Ought we not then to be* true and faith- 
ful in keeping His commandments? We 
ought not to complain if our stake con- 
ferences come and go and we do not 
have in our midst one of the' brethren 
known as the authorities of the Church. 
Why, my brethren and sisters, all men 
who hold the holy Priesthood are au- 
thorities in the Church, and through the 
Deacon the Lord may speak unto the 
people, and give His word of praise or 
reproof, or bestow upon them His 
blessing. The Priest and the Teacher 
likewise. The Bishop, the High Priest, 
the Seventy, the President of a Stake — 
all of these, servants of the Lord are 
authorities of the Church, and when 
you have them in your midst you may 
hear the word of the Lord preached, 
you may hear and see* and feel the in- 
spiration of the Lord. Therefore you 
should be content. You should not feel 
to complain, even though one of the 
Twelve,or the First Council of Seventy, 
or even the First Presidency, 
find it impossible to be with you. 
You should read the word of the Lord 
from the books, and kneeling down 
around the family altar, you should 
commune with the Lord and ask Him 
for wisdom, judfiment and enlighten- 
ment. You should depend more upon 
Him and less than some of us do upon 



those who constitute the authorities of 
the church. Then turn your hearts, my 
brethren and sisters, to the nations of 
the earth, to the kindreds, and tongues, 
and peoples, all of whom are the Lord's 
children, who are scattered throughout 
the length and breadth of the whole 
world in untold numbers, many of 
whom are only waiting for an oppor- 
tunity to hear the word of the Good 
Shepherd. Pray not only for your- 
selves, but for them also. Pray that 
the door of the Gospel may be opened 
to them, that the servants of the Lord 
may be sent unto them, and that those 
who have this work upon their shoul- 
ders of carrying the Gospel unto all na- 
tions may be at liberty to go. Say 
that they may go with your blessing, 
and that you will endeavor to more 
greatly appreciate the local authorities 
of the church, some of whom sit round 
your own tables and hearthstones, and 
are your sons, husbands and fathers 
who hold the holy priesthood. 

I was going to read from the Scrip- 
ture, but I have almost let it go by: 

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto treasure hid in a field; the which 
when a man hath found, he hideth, and 
for joy thereof goeth and selleth all 
that he hath, and buyeth that field. 

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like 
unto a merchant man, seeking goodly 
pearls: 

Who, when he had found one pearl of 
great price, went and sold all that he 
had, and bought it. (Matthew 18: 44-46.) 

Do we appreciate the kingdom of 
God in this way? Do we value it above 
all else? Is it more dear to us than 
the fruit of the field, than the treas- 
ures of the mine, than the wealth that 
can be gathered from all of the avoca- 
tions and occupations of life? Do we 
value thi % kingdom of God even as a 
goodly pearl, which is beyond price? I 
believe we do. All else is as nothing 
when compared to it, and we would 
gladly, if need be, sell all we had to 
possess it and make it our own, or at 
least to become a member in the king- 
dom. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, cleave 
unto the truth. Lay hold upon th<» 



GENERAL, AUTHORITIES.

"iron rod," and never, release that hold. 
Go forward steadily with your eyes set 
upon the tree of life until you are par- 
takers of its fruit, which is the word of 
the Lord, and which above all else is 
most joyous to the soul of the righteous 
man. Be faithful all your days. Pre- 
pare yourselves to help in the work of 
the redemption of the human race; and 
do not be content to say, "In my heart 
is a knowledge of the truth, I know 
the gospel is true, and I rejoice in it," 
and then stop. Do not stop there. Say 
that and still more: "O Lord, make 
me an instrument in Thy hands. Make 
all Thy servants who have been called 
of Thee wonderful and powerful in- 
struments in Thy hands, that this same 
gospel which lighteth my soul, and 
which filleth me with gladness, may be 
sent unto all the world, that my neigh- 
bor, my brother, Thy children, may re- 
joice in Thee, even with me, by being 
brought into Thy kingdom." May the 
testimony of the truth ever be with 
you, my brothers and sisters. May the 
powers of evil never be permitted to 
tempt you from your duty or from the 
path of right. The Lord will be with 
you, and build you up, and make you a 
power in the world for good; and 
through us, yes through us, even as 
through Father Abraham, because of 
our faithfulness in keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord, shall the whole 
world be blest and be led to glorify 
God. This is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, October 7, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn : 

Come, let us anew, our journey pursue, 

Roll round with the year, 
And never stand still till the Master 
appear. 

His adorable will let us gladly fulfil, 

And our talents improve, 
By the patience of hope and the labor 
of love. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Helaman 
Pratt. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn: 

O! ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 
Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow, and th* 
clear streamlets How. 
How I've longed to your bosom to flee. 

ELDER GEO. ALBERT SMITH. 

Why the Saints are regarded as a pe- 
culiar people.— The duty of forgiving one 
another.— Performance of duty increases 
faith.— We should not limit ourselves In 
good works.— The joy of eternal associa- 
tion with loved ones. 

My brethren and sisters, I am grate- 
ful to my Heavenly Father this morn, 
ing for the privilege of meeting with 
you in this house of worship. While I 
occupy this position I desire an interest 
in your faith and prayers, that I may 
be inspired by the Holy Spirit to say 
such things as He would have me say 
unto you. I have rejoiced with you in 
the remarks that have been made by 
our brethren in this conference, and it 
has been joy to me to see the multitude 
of Latter-day Saints present upon this 
occasion. The hymn that has just been 
sung is an inspiration to us who live 



in these mountain vales. I believe the 
fervor with which it was sung is an 
evidence of the appreciation of the 
Latter-day Saints for the blessings of 
our Father upon them. We are called 
a peculiar people because, perchance, 
we thoroughly believe and obey the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our peculiarity 
lies very largely in the fact that we 
believe the Old and New Testaments 
actually contain the word of the Lord, 
as far as they have been translated cor- 
rectly. We also firmly believe the Book 
of Mormon, which the world knows 
comparitively little of; and add to' that 
unwavering belief in the Doctrine and 
Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. We 
regard the teachings contained therein 
as revelations of our Father in heaven 
to His children who dwell upon this 
earth. It is not! alone because we have 
faith in the books referred to that we 
are considered a peculiar people, but al- 
so because we confidently believe that 
our Father in Heaven has spoken in 
this day and age. In fact, we know 
that thore is communication with the 
heavens. Our brethren and sisters of 
the world, generally, do not acknowl- 
edge that. We believe that Jehovah has 
the same feeling towards us, the same 
influence over us, that He had for and 
over His children who lived in this 
world in times that are past. If our 
peculiarity went to the extent that we 
lived by every word that proceedeth 
from the mouth of our Heavenly Fa- 
ther, then we would indeed be a 
blessed people. We do, to' a large de- 
gree, live by the testimony that has 
been given to us by our Redeemer, and 
thus far we are a blessed people, the 
acknowledged children of the Lord. 
There is one thing I find that we have 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



27 



not yet learned completely, and it comes 
to my mind this morning, that is, the 
disposition to forgive one another our 
trespasses. The Lord has given us grea<i 
information, has revealed His mind 
and will unto us, has taught us things 
that the world know not of, and, in 
accordance with the information we 
have received, He holds us responsible 
and expects us to live a higher life, a 
more ideal life than those who do not 
as fully comprehend the Gospel as we 
do. The spirit of forgiveness is some- 
thing that the Latter-day Saints might 
with profit exhibit more fully among 
themselves. Sometimes a brother in 
authority has offended, in some way, 
one of the members of the Church, 
probably unknown to himself, and that 
child of our Father's silenly continues 
to feel hurt, instead of doing as the 
Lord has commanded, going to the of- 
fending man and stating to him, in 
kindness, the feelings of his heart, and 
giving that brother an opportunity to 
say to him, "I am sorry I have offended 
you, and I desire that you shall for- 
give me." The result is that, in some 
instances, we And a resentful feeling 
existing that has been instigated by 
Satan. Now, we must get into a con- 
dition where we can forgive our breth- 
ren. In connection with this matter, I 
will read a few verses from the eigh- 
teenth chapter of St. Matthew, begin- 
ning with the twenty-first verse. It 
seems that the Apostles were with the 
Master upon this occasion, and Peter 
came to Him and said: 

"Lord, how oft shall my brother sin 
against me, and I forgive him? till 
seven times? 

Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto 
thee, Until seven times but, Until sev- 
enty times seven." 

Then the Savior gave a parable, which 
I will not take time to read, but it was 
a parable of two men. One of the men 
owed his lord a large amount of money, 
and he come to him and told him he 
could not pay what he owed, and asked 
that he might be forgiven the debt. The 
lord of that servant was moved with 
compassion, and forgave the debt. 
Straightway this man who had been 
forgiven went out and found a fellow- 



servant who owed hinj a small amount, 
and he demanded his pay. The poor 
man was unable to meet the obliga- 
tion, and he in turn a=ked that he 
might be forgiven the debt. But he 
was not forgiven; on the contrary he 
was taken and cast into prison by the, 
one who had already been forgiven by 
his lord. When the other fellow-ser- 
vants saw what had been done they 
went to the lord of this man and told 
him. and he Avas wroth and delivered 
the one whom he had forgiven unto 
torment, until he should pay all 
that was due. His soul was not bis: 
enough to appreciate the mercy shown 
him, and because of that lack of chari- 
tv he lost all. At times we find little 
difficulties arising among us, and we 
forget the patience our Father in 
Heaven exercises towards us, and we 
magnify in our hearts some trivial 
thing that our brother or sister may 
have done or said concerning us. We 
do not always live that law which the 
Lord desires us to observe in regard to 
these matters. We forget the com- 
mandment He gave to the Apostles in 
the words of the prayer, wherein they 
were told to pray that they might be 
forgiven their debts even as they for- 
give their debtors. I feel that we have 
to learn a great deal in this regard. We 
have not complied as completely as we 
should with the requirements of our 
Heavenly Father. In the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants we find a ref- 
erence made to this matter of for- 
giveness, wherein the Lord gives a 
commandment; it is contained in the 
sixty-fourth section, and refers to us 
in this day. It reads as follows: 

"Nevertheless he has sinned, but veri- 
ly I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive 
sins unto those who confess their sins 
before me and ask forgiveness, who 
have not sinned unto death. 

"My disciples, in days of old, sought 
occasion against one another, and for- 
gave not one another in their hearts, 
and for this evil they were afflicted, and 
sorely chastened: 

"Wherefore I say unto you, that ye 
ought to forgive one another, for he 
that forgiveth not his brother his tres- 
passes, standeth condemned before the 
Lord, for there remaineth in him the 
greater sin." 



2S 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



(The verse last read is the one 1 
would emphasize.) 

"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I 
will forgive, but of you it is required 
to forgive all men; 

"And ye ought to say in your hearts, 
let God judge between me and thee, 
and reward thee according to thy 
deeds." 

If our lives were such that, when wo 
differ with our neighbor, if, instead of 
setting ourselves up as judges one 
against another, we could honestly and 
conscientiously appeal to our Father 
in Heaven and say, "Lord, judge be- 
tween me and my brother; thou know- 
cst my heart; Thou knowest I have 
no feeling of anger against him; help 
us to see alike, and give us wisdom 
that we may deal righteously with 
each other," how few differences there 
would be, and what joy and blessings 
would come to us! But, little difficulties 
arise from time to time which disturb 
the equilibrium of our daily lives, and 
we continue to be unhappy because we 
cherish an improper influence, and have 
not charity. 

We find another reference to this 
matter, that has a bearing also upon 
another condition, in that sometimes 
we feel uneasy and worried when we 
fail to do what our Father desires of 
us. A man who is living in accord- 
ance with the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
never in doubt about its success; but 
the man who neglects his duty, who 
fails to keep his covenants, loses the 
Spirit of the Lord, and he then begins 
to wonder what will become of Zion. 
Whenever you, my fellow laborers, feel 
there is something wrong with the 
Church, go into your secret places and 
kneel down before the Lord, examine 
your heart, and you will find every time 
that there is something in your own life 
that occasions doubt; the tempter is 
working on your mind, causing you to 
feel that perhaps Zion will not be vic- 
torious. Whenever you are doing your 
full duty, you will know, as you know 
that you live, that it is our Father's 
work, and that He will brinjj it off 
triumphant. We find in the ninety- 
eighth section of the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants the following reference: 



"And again I say unto you, if ye 
observe to do whatsoever I command 
you, I, the Lord, will turn away all 
wrath and indignation from you, and 
the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against you." 

This is the word of our Father in 
Heaven to us. 

And again with reference to patience 
under persecution: 

'Now I speak unto you concerning 
your families; if men will smite you, or 
your families, once, and ye bear it pa- 
tiently and revile not against them, 
neither seek revenge, ye shall be re- 
warded; 

"But if ye bear it not patiently, It 
shall be accounted unto you as being 
meted out a just measure unto you." 

This also is the word of the Master 
unto us. If we live according to this 
law, wo will grow in grace and strength 
day by day, and in favor with our 
Heavenly Father. Faith will increase 
in the hearts of our children. They 
will love us for the uprightness and 
integrity of our lives, and they will re- 
joice that they have been born of such 
parents. I say to you that this com- 
mandment is not given in an idle way; 
for the Lord has declared that He does 
not give any law indifferently, but 
every law is given that it may be kept 
and lived up to by us. We will be m 
this world only a short time. The 
youneest and strongest of us are sim- 
ply preparing for the other life, and be>- 
fore we get into the glory of our Fa- 
ther and enjoy the blesings that we 
hope to receive through faithfulness, we 
will have to live the laws of oatience, 
and exercise forgiveness toward those 
who trespass against us, and remove 
from our hearts all feelings of hatred 
toward them. 

"And again, if your enemy shall smite 
you the second time, and you revile not 
against your enemy, and bear it pa- 
tiently, your reward shall be an hun- 
dred fold. 

"And again, if he shall smite you the 
third time, and ye bear it patiently, 
your reward shall be doubled unto you 
four fold; 

"And these three testimonies shall 
stand against your enemy if he repent 
not, and shall not be blotted out." 

There is a disposition on the part of 



ELDER GEORGE 

some returned Elders, and other men 
who hold the Priesthood, and women, 
who hold positions in the Church, to 
neglect Sacrament meetings and other 
important duties, and to confine their 
labors to some soecial calling. They 
may be officers and teachers in the Sun- 
day school, and when they perform 
their Sabbath school labor, consider 
that sufficient; or, they may be Mutual 
Improvement workers, and if they dis- 
charge their obligations in that regard 
they consider their whole duty done. 
But, this is an erroneous idea. "We 
are required to live by every word that 
proceedeth from the mouth of our Fa- 
ther in Heaven. We are expected to so 
conduct ourselves day by day that, if 
we see distress or want, or need of ad- 
vice and counsel on any occasion, we 
should forthwith act as servants ot 
the Lord in very deed. We find in the 
fifty-eighth section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants a reference to this matter: 
I desire to read it to you, because it 
is the word of the Lord with reference 
to our opportunities: 

"For behold/ it is not meet that 1 
should command in all things, for he 
that is compelled in all things, the 
same is a slothful and not a wise ser- 
vant; wherefore he receiveth no re- 
ward. 

"Verily I say, men should be anxi- 
ously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and 
bring to pass much righteousness; 

"For the power is in them, wherein 
they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in 
nowise lose their reward. 

"But he that doeth not anything un- 
til he is commanded, and receiveth a 
commandment with doubtful heart, and 
keepeth it with slothfulness, the same 
is damned. . ' 

"Who am I that made man, saith the 
Lord, that will hold him guiltless that 
obeys not my commandments?" 

I feel that we are representatives of 
a great people. We have met together 
from all the stakes and branches of the 
Church. We have come to be fed by 
the Spirit of our Master. When we go 
back to our homes, if there are those 
among us who are indifferent and 
careless, it is our duty to call their 
attention to the Scriptures and to 
bring them face to face with the com- 



ALBERT SMITH. 29 

mandments of our heavenly Father. 
There are many young men who are 
indifferent and careless, but who pos- 
sess some ability, and as the Lord has 
said in this revelation, they should not 
wait to be commanded, but volunteer 
to go forth and, in the authority of the 
Holy Priesthood, labor for the salva- 
tion of the souls of the children of 
men. 

Grateful should we be, that in the 
fastnesses of these grand mountains, 
our feet have been planted; and that 
the Messiah has imparted to us a 
knowledge that the Gospel is true. 
Grateful should we be for a knowledge 
of the eternity of the marriage cov- 
enant. If in this life only had we hope, 
we would indeed be of all men most 
miserable. The assurfance that our 
relationship here as parents and chil- 
dren, as husbands and wives will con- 
tinue in heaven, and that this is but 
the beginning of a great and glorious 
kingdom that our Father has destined 
we shall inherit on the other side, fills 
us with hope and joy. One of the 
greatest evidences to me of the divin- 
ity of this work is that it teaches there 
is eternal life on the other side, and 
that there will be a reunion there of 
the loved ones who have known each 
other here. Consequently, as parents, 
we may well be patient and loving to- 
ward our children, for they will etern- 
ally abide with us on the other side, 
if we and they are faithful. The few 
years that we live here may be re- 
garded as a time in which we become 
acquainted, but, when we mingle in 
the other life, we will know each 
other better than we have here. Grate- 
ful am I that this testimony has been 
given me, and for the knowledge that 
the Savior was indeed the Redeemer 
of the world. Thankful am I for the 
testimony that Joseph Smith was in- 
deed a Prophet of the Lord, and that 
every one of those who have succeeded 
him. in the exalted calling of presi- 
dent of this Church, have been inspired 
by the same spirit that characterized 
Joseph Smith's life. I am glad to add 
my testimony to the integrity of 
Joseph F. Smith. No matter what the 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



world may think of him, no matter 
what unkind things they have said of 
him, I testify to you that he is, indeed, 
a servant of the Lord, that he stands at 
the head of this work, by Divine ap- 
pointment, and that there is no power, 
either in earth or in hell, that can de- 
stroy the influence our Father has 
given to him. He is surrounded by 
men who are faithful and true, men 
who love the Saints better than their 
very lives, men who devote the ener- 
gies and cowers that God has given 
unto them to your blessing. They 
leave their homes and the comforts 
thereof, and labor constantly, not that 
they may be glorified, but that you 
and your families and all mankind may 
be saved and exalted. Honor and love 
these men, sustain them with your 
faith and prayers, and as you uphold 
them in the positions to w r hich they 
have been called, so will our Father 
in Heaven sustain and bless and mag- 
nify you in the eyes of your families 
and those with whom you associate. 
May the peace of heaven be with us. 
May the ensuing meetings be a joy and 
blessing to every one of us, as were 
those of yesterday. May we have the 
Spirit of the Master dwelling within 
us, that we may forgive all men as He 1 
nas commanded, forgive, not only with 
our lips, but in the very depths of our 
hearts, every trespass that may have 
been committed against us. If we do 
this through life, the blessings of the 
Lord will abide in our hearts and our 
homes, which may God grant, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 
(President of Granite Stake.) 
I desire, my brothers and sisters, to 
•enjoy the same good spirit that has ac- 
tuated the remarks of the brethren who 
have preceded me. I feel grateful unto 
my Heavenly Father that I can bear 
my testimony to the work of the Lord, 
and that we have servants and proph- 
ets of the Lord ministering to us. I 
have been much impressed with the 
remarks of Elder George A. Smith this 
morning on the spirit of forgiveness. I 
feel how necessary it is that we as Lat- 



ter-day Saints should have 'this in our 
souls, not only towards those who a"re 
of our own faith, but the Savior re- 
quires that we have it towards all men. 
In connection with this,I bear testimony 
'that I have been acquainted with the 
authorities of this Church from Pres- 
ident Young until this day, and that I 
have witnessed this spirit of forgiveness 
in the hearts of all those prophets and 
leaders of the Church. They have felt 
to forgive their fellowmen. I was not, 
of course, acquainted with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith; but my father was inti- 
mate with him, and hundreds of times 
I have listened to him discourse on the 
merits and graces that characterized 
the Prophet, and I learned to love him 
more dearly because of the kindness of 
his heart and because he loved all per- 
sons, little children and all. I remem- 
ber, a year or two ago, a man bearing 
his testimony to the kindness of the 
Prophet Joseph toward little ones, and 
it struck me as being very similar to 
the character of our Savior. He refer- 
red to an incident when he was a little 
bare-footed boy. He was traveling in 
to Far West, and it was inclement 
weather. He and several other small 
boys were paddling through the cold 
water and their feet were chilled. A 
man came along on horseback and he 
picked them up, one by one, took a 
large silk handkerchief out of his pock- 
et and tried to warm their benumbed 
feet. It is only a little incident, but it 
shows the kindness of the Prophet's 
heart toward little ones. I remember 
my father speaking of the mobbings, 
trials and privations he endured and 
I being but a little boy, unable to dis- 
criminate always between right and 
wrong, and not having that feeling of 
forgiveness which the Gospel of Christ 
brings to the soul, my face used to 
blush up and I would become indig- 
nant, and felt in my heart that when 
I became a man I would resent the 
wrongs that had been perpetrated up- 
on our fathers in establishing this 
work. My father used to smile at 
me, and pat me on the back and 
say, "My boy, that is not the kind of 
spirit that the Gospel leaves in the 



ELDER FRANK Y. TAYLOR. 



31 



hearts of mankind; as you grow older 
you must learn that you must for- 
give." This gospel of ours is designed 
to save, to build up, to bless and com- 
fort; and it is not right on our part to 
Tiarm any man. I have been acquaint- 
ed with these brethren. I have listen- 
ed to their testimonies, and I know thav 
I have never yet listened to their 
voices being raised to harm or injure 
any man. On the other hand, their 
counsel and advice has been uplifting, 
saving, and such as would bless and 
comfort all who would give heed to it. 
I know that they have been good, clean 
men, and I know their advice has been 
good and would bless me if I would 
only carry it out. I honor them for this. 
I know that the example they have set 
in this community has been good, one 
that anybody could imitate with profit 
and blessing. When I think of this, I 
think how different it is to the spirit 
that has characterized some of our 
friends who do not have the same 
faith that we have. I never knew the 
authorities of this church to go out into 
the world condemning mankind, and 
pulling them down. On the contrary, 
their counsel and their lives have been 
examples to live up to, and that would 
benefit and bless mankind. I have met 
many people of different denominations 
in the world, and I have been 
anxious to learn concerning their faith, 
to find out what they possessed that 
might add to my faith and increase 
my knowledge, but I never had one of 
them manifest a spirit to bless me. I 
have had them by the score point the 
finger of scorn at me, and I have heard 
them ridicule the best men of our com- 
munity, men I love with my whole 
heart. I have had men tell me that 
my father, who I knew was clean, pure 
and upright, was not a fit man to as- 
sociate with. Figuratively, I never had 
one of them hand me a loaf, when I 
asked for it they have given me a 
stone. On the other hand, whenever I 
have gone to the authorities of this 
church they have given me comfort, 
and peace. The spirit that seeks to 
pull down, to destroy, and to harm 
mankind, is not the Spirit of the Lord 



Jesus Christ. The genius of this gos- 
pel is to build up, not to destroy; it is 
to unite, not to dismember; it is to 
bring peace and good will, not to bring 
sorrow and distress. I testify that when 
I have lived this religion, and done my 
duty, the Spirit has brought unto me 
peace, comfort and blessing. As I 
have grown older I have learned, as 
my father testified to me when I was 
a boy, that when people live this re- 
ligion and keep the commandments of 
the Lord they seek to build up, to bless, 
and to comfort mankind. "When I was 
young it used to be quite a testimony 
to me, and it is today, that the religion 
of the world cannot be true because the 
followers seek to destroy the character 
of clean, good men, and to pull down 
this work of our Heavenly Father. I 
know that the Spirit of the Lord does 
not actuate men to injure or to destroy, 
or to pull down any people, whether in 
this church or any other church. The 
Spirit of the Lord does not actuate peo- 
ple to do harm, or to do ill of any kind. 
I take delight, brothers and sisters., in 
sustaining the authorities of this 
church, because I know they are men of 
God, actuated by the Spirit to bless and 
comfort us if we will only follow their 
teachings. God forbid that I should 
forsake them, or that my hand should 
be raised against them, or that I should 
indirectly or directly be a party to any 
attempt to nullify their good works 
and bring to naught that which they 
desire for the blessing and comfort of 
the Latter-day Saints. If we will heed 
their counsels we will be happy indeed, 
and we will be blessed and sustained 
by our Heavenly Father. I have no fear 
of the Latter-day Saints in the least 
about this matter, because I know 
those whom I come in contact with, 
that are living their religion, manifest 
unity of faith, and do sustain those 
who preside over them. I know that 
the people in the stake over which I 
preside sustain the authorities of "this 
church with their whole hearts, and pro- 
pose to continue to sustain them. 

I do not feel that it would be wise for 
me to continue my remarks. I love 
this work, I love the authorities who 



32 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



preside over us. I have a testimony 
of the truth of this work. As I live 
nearer to my heavenly Father I enjoy 
more of the Spirit of the Lord, I have 
more happiness and peace in my heart, 
and I feel kindly towards all mankind. 
May the blessing's of the Lord attend 
you ever, I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

PATRIARCH JOHN SMITH. 

Testimony concerning the divine calling 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith.— Neces- 
sity for following the promptings of 
the Holy Spirit. 

My brethren and sisters, it is with a ' 
feeling of pleasure, also of regret, that 
I stand before you on this occasion. It 
is a pleasure to me to be in the line of 
my duty. It is a pleasure to me to 
look at the faces of the people who are 
present, and to see so many gathered 
here to listen to the words of the Lord 
through His servants. It is with re- 
gret that I realize I am not what is 
termed a public speaker. It is seldom 
that my voice is heard in public, and 
unless you give me your faith and 
prayers to bring something to my mind, 
it will be a hard matter for me to say 
anything profitable to you on this oc- 
casion. I have a testimony to bear that 
this is the work of God, that we are His 
people, that Joseph was a prophet of 
the Lord, and that he gave unto us, 
through the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit, the principles of life and salva- 
tion, which are now taught to the peo- 
ple. On many occasions I know that the 
Lord has been with me, and has in- 
spired my sayings. I can bear testi- 
mony also that it is through the faith 
and prayers of the Saints I am here 
now. On two different occasions I have 
been physically broken down by over- 
work, but the faith and prayers of the 
Saints have prevailed, and I am here 
today, and, the Lord being my helper, 
I shall stay with you sometime yet. I 
bear testimony that that which we have 
listened to thus far through the confer- 
ence is just and true. It has been spoken 
by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, 



and if we, as a people, will follow the- 
instructions we have received it will 
be well with us. In my travels among 
the people of late I have noticed that 
they are, as a rule, striving to live 
their religion and do their duty. They 
are striving to live before our Heaven- 
ly Father in that way and manner that 
His blessings will attend them. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints we have many duties to 
perform, and if we are diligent, and 
learn to listen to the whispering of the 
Good Spirit, we will not often err in 
judgment. All persons have a good 
monitor with them, and If they will 
live in a proper manner that monitor 
will direct them in the right path, and 
they will make no mistakes, but if they 
are careless and indifferent, trusting en- 
tirely to their own judgment, then they 
are liable to err. Speaking of the prin- 
ciple of forgiveness, we find that it is 
not so much among us as it ought to 
be. We should strive to live according 
to the old adage, "Do unto others as 
you would they should do unto you." 
If we will be guided by the True Spirit, 
and follow its promptings, it will be 
better for us. That the blessings of the 
Father may rest upon Israel and guide 
us in the true path, that when our time 
comes to go hence His blessings shall 
be with us and we shall be prepared 
to receive all that He has promised the 
-faithful, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 

(President of Cassia Stake.) 
My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
thankful this morning for the oppor- 
tunity I have, in connection with you, 
in attending this general conference, 
of the church. I have rejoiced very 
much in the testimonies of those who 
have spoken in this meeting, and in the 
previous sessions of this conference, 
I have a testimony that our brethren, 
who have addressed us have spoken 
the truth, because they are actuated by 
the spirit of truth. They are men of 
God, engaged in the work of salva- 
tion, and I know that their words are 
words of eternal life. It is an exceed- 
ing great pleasure to us, living as we 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK. 



33 



do in one *of the remotei stakes of Zion, 
to have the privilege of coming to con- 
ference to hear the words of inspira- 
tion that fall from the lips of the ser- 
vants of the Lord, and listen to the 
sweet singing that we hear. These 
things cause my heart to rejoice, and I 
feel continually to praise the Lord and 
acknowledge His goodness. I desire with 
all my heart to be ah;e to serve Him, 
to keep His commandments and to be 
instrumental in His hands in seeking 
to bring to pass righteousness among 
the children of men. 

The Cassia stake over which I have 
the honor to preside, is one of the 
small stakes of the church, our popu- 
lation numbering only 3,231 souls. Of 
this number, we have nine hundred and 
forty-four children under eight years 
of age. I felt very pleased yesterday, 
while President Smith was speaking of 
the limited number of missionaries now 
abroad carrying glad tidings of sal- 
vation, that it is our good fortune to 
have about forty brethren from Cas- 
sia stake in the mission field, who have 
gone willingly, yea, gladly, in order that 
they may assist in accomplishing this 
part of the work of the Church. The 
Stake in which I reside is one of the 
new settlements of the Church. We 
have within our borders one of the 
great government projects for bringing 
water upon the arid lands, and through 
the efficiency of the servants of the 
government in this work much is being 
accomplished. Many thousands of acres 
of land will be brought under cultiva- 
tion, and homes can be made by thou- 
sands of people. We have, at the pres- 
ent time, coming into that part of the 
State of Idaho people from nearly all 
parts of the United States, and I am 
very pleased to note that they are men 
and women of good principles, as a 
rule. They are honest, industrious, and 
friendly toward their neighbors. They 
have not come with the predjudices and 
animosities that our missionaries often 
find in the east. We are glad to ex- 
tend the hand of friendship to all such 
people. The time will come when that 
part of the state will become import- 
ant. We hope as citizens of that state 
3 



to assist by our efforts in helping to 
bring to pass this change. 

Our people are an exceedingly good 
class. I do not believe it would be pos- 
sible to go into any of the Stakes of 
Zion and find Latter-day Saints who 
are more sincerely endeavoring to live 
their religion than the people of the 
Cassia stake. As a rule they are liv- 
ing in peace, and I believe they possess 
the spirit of forgiveness. They are en- 
deavoring through faith and prayer to 
continue in possession of the inspiration 
of the Holy Spirit, which leads and 
guides into all truth. In consequence 
of the newness of our country we are 
just beginning the erection of com- 
modious meetinghouses in our wards. 
Wherever we see these houses, we look 
upon them with the thought that a part 
of the means used for this 
purpose has come to us from 
the Trustee-in-Trust. and when 
we read the newspaper agitation 
which is going on over the disposition 
of the tithes, Ave look at our ward meet- 
inghouses, our Stake meetinghouse, our 
beautiful Academy, realizing they are 
monuments to the credit of the tithe 
payers, and to the beneficence of the 
authorities of this Church. I 
want to say. my brethren and sis- 
ters, in behalf of the saints of the 
Cassia stake of Zion, I believe there is 
not one among them who is paying 
tithing that is questioning as to the dis- 
position of that fund. We know full 
well the men into whose hands it comes, 
and we know that it is handled as 
carefully and judiciously as any mon- 
ey in this world can be handled. We 
have implicit faith and confidence in 
President Joseph F. Smith, and his 
counselors, the Twelve Apostles, the 
Seven Presidents of Seventies, and in 
all the general authorities of this 
Church, because we know that they 
are men of God. We are endeavoring 
to the best of our ability to uphold 
their hands. It is our practice to go 
before the Lord and, in the earnestness 
of our souls, ask him to bless and pre- 
serve and magnify these brethren. I 
realize, as you do, that the Lord has 
blest them, that He has sustained 



34 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



them, and that He is assisting them 
in the very important duties they have 
to perform. 

"We are endeavoring to assist in the 
building up of the Gem State. We 
see in our state immense possibilities. 
"We are sustaining the officers of the. 
government of our state. "We look upon 
them as being exceptionally good men. 
We are honoring the laws of the land in 
which we live, both local and general. 
This, I may say, is a characteristic of 
Latter-day Saints. They have been 
taught from childhood to honor the 
flag of our country, to" obey the laws o£ 
the land. This is being done, notwith- 
standing what may be said to the con- 
trary by the enemies of this work. We 
love our country. We honor that great 
and good man, President Roosevelt, 
who stands at its head. We look upon 
him as a man of destiny, a man of ex- 
ceptional power and ability, a man 
whom we believe God has raised up; and 
his influence is being felt in the west, in 
the reclamation of thousands of acres 
of arid lands that have been bleached 
in the sunshine of heaven. I say, God 
bless our country, its laws and its in- 
stitutions, its officers and its people. I 
believe that the gospel has inspired 
within my heart greater love for this 
country, greater veneration for its laws", 
than I could possibly have felt had it 
not been for the influence of the gospel. 
I believe that the same feeling prevails, 
as a rule, among the Latter-day Saints. 
I know that our authorities are patri- 
otic, loyal men. If there is one individ- 
ual in this church that I have admired 
more than any other, it is President 
Joseph F. Smith, because I have lookei 
upon him as a model among men. I 
have watched his purity of life, I have 
observed his nobility of character, I 
have noted his sacrifices'in his labor for 
the benefit of mankind. I know there 
is a man standing at the head of this 
church at the present time whose su- 
perior cannot be found in this wide 
world. That is my testimony and my 
feelings regarding President Joseph F. 
Smith. These men who stand at the 
head of this church are men whose 
lives are exemplary. They are men who 



are and have been willing to sacrifice 
for this work and for the salvation of 
the souls of mankind. It cannot be said 
of these brethren that they say to the 
rank and file of the church, go hither 
and thither into the missionary field, 
and they themselves remain at home; 
but as you know, my brethren and sis- 
ters, all of these general authorities are 
practical missionaries. They have 
been out into the world. They 
have marked the path and led the way. 
They have brought home sheaves for 
their hire. They have in all these re- 
spects, and in all other respects, set 
before the membership of this church 
an example they expect us to follow, and 
I hope we will not be unmindful Df 
their counsels. I thought while Presi- 
dent Smith was addressing us yester- 
day, how few of us have attempted in 
the last three years to extricate our- 
selves from the bonds of indebtedness: 
some have been inclined to go further 
into debt, and have reached out upon 
the right hand and upon the left, and 
today it is a question as to whether 
or not the Latter-day Saints are in any 
better condition financially than they 
were when this note was first sounded 
by the prophet of the Lord. So far as 
I am concerned as an individual (I do 
not say it boastingly), I have tried to 
follow the example of these brethren. 
I have taken their counsel in relation 
to debt, and I stand today an example 
of the benefits of following the counsel 
of those who are in authority over us. 
The Lord will bless us if we will do 
this, we will get out of debt and sur- 
round ourselves with the necessaries 
and comforts of life. I suggest to the 
Latter-day Saints that one of the best 
ways to get out of debt, and to keep 
tout, is to pay as we go. If we have 
not money to pay for anything, let us 
Bo without it until we get the money. 
We have demonstrated that in our 
stake in the last sixteen months. In 
one concern where there was a debt of 
some ?23,000 hanging over the institu- 
tion; today it is practically out of debt, 
by reason of the fact that the directors 
adopted the system of requiring the peo- 
ple to pay cash for what they got. It

lias enabled that institution to get out 
of trouble, and has lifted it up so that 
today it is independent. I recommend 
this to the Latter-day Saints, and sug- 
gest that we adopt a cash policy, and 
pay as we go. While doing this, let 
us endeavor to live our religion, attend 
to our prayers, do our duty, attend our 
meetings, and seek first the kingdom 
of God and His righteousness. I testi- 
fy to you, as a servant of God, that all 
other things will be added unto us. 
This gospel is true*, there is no doubt 
about that, and it will save us if we 
will live according to its precepts. 

May the peace and blessings of th j 
Almighty rest upon us. May the in- 
spiration of His Holy Spirit enlighten 
our minds, quicken our understandings, 
enable us to comprehend the truth 
when we hear it, and cause us to be 
united in all the affairs of life; that we 
may be forgiving in our lives, and, as 
we read from the revelation, seek to 
forgive all men, not only those who are 
members of the church, but forgive all 
men, no matter 'who they may be. If 
we will do this, the Lord will in the 
end forgive us, and will lift us up to 
Asalvaition. Peace b,e unto you, my 
brethren and sisters. May the blessings 
of the Almighty rest upon you, and His 
prosperity attend you in your homes. 
I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

Elder John Robinson rendered a sa- 
cred solo entitled "Grant Us Thy 
Peace." 

ELDER CHRISTIAN D. FJELDSTED. 

I do not know if I shall be able to 
speak loud enough to be heard by this 
vast congregation, but I esteem it a 
great privilege to attend this confer- 
ence, a privilege I have not had for 
several years. I can truly say I am en- 
joying the Spirit there is in this con- 
ference. The doctrines we have listen- 
ed to have come from God, and the 
singing has been quite inspiring. 
Thanks be to God, we are living in a 
time when we have inspired men to 
lead us. I have been in Scandinavia for 
several years, and I bring kind regards 
and thanks from the Saints of those 
countries, for the liberal feelings man- 



ifested both by the trustee-in-trust and 
by the people here generally, through 
whose donations we have been greatly 
assisted, and we now have some very 
good meetinghouses in those countries. 
The gosDel is spreading, and is being 
preached with power. I can say, in 
behalf of the Elders who have been 
sent from home, that they are doing a 
good work. They are fine men. You 
parents whose sons are out in the field 
can rejoice, because they are good boys, 
they are doing a good work, and they 
are living their religion. It is a hard 
matter to learn a language, but even 
in that the Lord is blessing them won- 
derfully. They meet, of course, with 
a good deal of opposition, and finding 
fault with the principles of the gospel 
by our friends outside of the church. 
I have told them we have not originat- 
ed this gospel, neither has Joseph 
Smith nor the other leaders of the 
church; it originated with the Lord, 
the Creator of the world, and if you 
have any complaint to make against 
the principles of the gospel, He is the 
individual for you to complain against, 
not Joseph Smith, nor the Latter-day 
Saints. The Lord has revealed this 
grand and glorious gospel. He appear- 
ed to Joseph Smith and introduced His 
Son, even the Savior of the world, who 
spoke to Joseph Smith concerning the 
gospel; and that is where the complaint 
should be laid if there is any. We say 
that the principles of the gospel are 
true, and are calculated to exalt man- 
kind, to bless the people, and to bring 
salvation to the human family, if they 
will obey it. My brothers and sisters, 
it is for us, as Latter-day Saints, to 
live our religion, because this is the 
work of God. His servants who stand 
at the head of His church are leading 
Israel in the way of salvation. May the 
Lord help us that we may do our duty, 
live our religion, honor our Father in 
heaven, and keep the covenants we 
have entered into, is my prayer, for 
Christ's sake. Amen.

Permanence and perpetuitv of the 
Church.— Its growth and development.— 
No hiatus in its history.— Kevs given 
to Joseph Smith not to be taken awav. 
— Organization of First Presidency.— It 
is not hereditary.— The work of' God 

. will continue and abide forever. 

It is a great pleasure to me to look 
upon this congregation. We have come 
here from different parts of this state 
and of the surrounding states and ter- 
ritories that we might associate as 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints in general confer- 
ence. I feel for one that we have been 
well repaid for such journeyings as we 
have had to undertake in order to come 
here. The Spirit that has prevailed in 
this conference from the very begin- 
ning has been such as to give comfort 
and joy and confidence to the Latter- 
day Saints assembled, and to increase 
in our souls a determination that we 
will serve the Lord, that we will keep 
His commandments, that we will 
sustain His servants whom He has 
appointed to guide and direct the af- 
fairs of His Church on earth, and that 
we will place ourselves in such a con- 
dition that the Lord may use us for the 
accomplishment of His purposes, for 



the upbuilding of His kingdom, for the 
spread of truth and righteousness, and 
to help prepare the way for the com- 
ing of Him whose right it is to reign 
over all the earth. I am sure that 
every person present who knows any- 
thing about the operations of the Spir- 
it of the Lord has had a testimony 
in his or her heart that the Lord is 
with His servants, that His power at- 
tends their ministrations, and that they 
are really and truly engaged in the 
Lord's work, and 'not in the work of 
man alone. 

A remark made by Elder John Henry 
Smith, I am sure was thoroughly ap- 
preciated by those who heard him, and 
recommended itself to my soul, and 
that was, that the Lord in the latter 
days was to establish a kingdom that 
should "not be given to another peo- 
ple," that should not be overcome of 
the world but should stand forever, and 
it was to be given "to the people of 
the Saints of the Most High," and they 
should possess it for an everlasting 
kingdom. Now, we understood in the 
beginning, when we obeyed the Gospel 
of Christ and became members of this 
Church, that this promise was in rela- 
tion to the work in which we became 
engaged. That it was to be different 
from former dispensations. That while 
the establishment of the Church and 
kingdom of God in former times was 
such that it was temporary and was 
overcome by the powers of evil — the 
world, the flesh and the devil, this lat- 
ter-day work was to continue and 
abide. That it should not cease, but 
that it was established here permanent- 
ly. We applied to ourselves the remark 
of the Prophet Isaiah concerning the 
great latter-day work, that the truth 
which the Lord revealed to us should 
"not depart from us nor from our seed, 
nor from our seed's seed, from hence- 
forth, even forever." We understood 
that while those former dispensations 
only lasted for a time, and then wicked- 
ness came in like a flood and spread 
over the earth, that the dispensation 
of the fulness of times which the Lord 
ushered in through His servant Joseph 
Smith, was to continue and prevail over 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



every power beneath the eternal heav- 
ens, to establish truth and righteous- 
ness in the earth, to overcome the pow- 
ers of evil, and bring to pass the pur- 
poses of God in the establishment of 
His kingdom and the coming of Je- 
sus Christ, our Lord, to reign as King 
of kings and Lord of lords. That while 
in former times the powers of the 
world had overcome the saints, in the 
latter days, in the last dispensation, 
the people and kingdom of God were 
to prevail over the kingdoms of this 
world and the powers of darkness, un- 
til Satan and his hosts should be bound 
and evil should be exterminated from 
the earth, and righteousness should 
come in, and "a king should reign in 
righteousness and princes should rule 
in judgment." 

Was not this the understanding that 
we had in the very beginning of our 
career in the Church? And has not the 
Lord strengthened that faith in our 
souls by the manner in which He has 
caused this work to prevail and pro- 
gress in the earth? When we look up- 
on the congregations of the saints in 
this conference and realize the fact, 
repeatedly stated here, that we are 
only representatives of the great body 
of the Church located in different narts 
of the world, we may exclaim as one 
did when the telegraph line com- 
pleted, "What hath God wrought!" He 
has brought us from afar; He has con- 
gregated us here in the mountains, in 
fulfillment of that which He predicted 
through the Prophet Joseph, that be- 
fore the Lord should come "Zion should 
rejoice on the hills and should flourish 
in the mountains." Zion, that has 
brought good tidings, as the Prophet 
Isaiah predicted, has come up into the 
high mountain, and as he and Micah 
both predicted, the people of God 
have come from the nations afar off. 
They have gathered up into the heights 
of the mountains. They have come 
here "to learn the ways of the Lord and 
to walk in His paths." They are build- 
ing the house of the Lord, as he fore- 
saw it, "in the tops of the mountains." 

An effort has been made for some 



37 

time past to make some of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints believe that at a cer- 
tain period of the Church's history 
there was a great hiatus, that the 
Church became disorganized, as it were, 
because Joseph the Prophet died, mar- 
tyred with his brother Hyrum for the 
word of the Lord and the testimony 
of Jesus, and that because the quorum 
of the First Presidency was disorgan- 
ized the Church was disorganized and 
rejected. Now, my dear brethren and 
sisters and friends, if that were the 
case, then the hopes planted in our 
bosoms by the power of the Spirit of 
God in the beginning were vain, the 
promises made to the Church in the 
start were not true. God declared that 
He had set up His Church upon the 
earth "in the last days for the last 
time," and that it should prevail and 
should not be prevailed against. The 
idea that the disorganization of one 
quorum of the holy priesthood disor- 
ganized the Church is in itself an ab- 
surdity, and might be rejected by every 
sensible Saint. But you know there 
are evil influences abroad in the earth, 
and different spirits have gone forth 
to deceive the children of men, and we 
who are the servants of the Lord ought 
to be well posted on these matters, so 
that we may be able to dissipate doubt 
and uncertainty, and explain that which 
may seem a little mysterious to some 
people who are not fully in the light, 
because we do not all have the same 
degree of faith. Certainly, I believe 
that the congregations that have as- 
sembled here have not the least dubiety 
in their minds. The spirit that has pre- 
vailed here has testified of this. The 
unanimity with which the servants of 
God who have been appointed and 
called to lead the people in the latter 
days were accepted and endorsed by 
the congregation, without any dissent- 
ing voice, testifies to this. But there 
are others who are not up to the mark, 
not up to the standard, and they need 
encouraging, and need to have things 
explained to them, and we should be 
ready to expound, explain and exhort 
with all long-suffering, that the faith of 
the saints may be confirmed, and that

they may understand things as they 
are. 

Now, when the Lord established the 
Church, as you know, it was but a 
little thing. As one of the writers of 
the Book of Mormon said, "out of small 
things proceedeth that which is great." 
That has been fulfilled, so far, in the 
history of this Church. Yet this is only 
the beginning of the magnitude of the 
great latter-day work, which shall 
prevail over everything that is evil and 
establish the kingdom of God in all the 
world. When the Church was organiz- 
ed, only six members were present at 
its organization; at any rate that num- 
ber took part in the legal organization 
of the Church, and if all those who had 
been baptized at that time were count- 
ed they would make a very small num- 
ber. The Church gradually grew and 
increased. It illustrated what the Sa- 
vior said in regard to the work of God. 
It came forth, "first the blade, and then 
the ear, and after that, the full corn in 
the ear." It is a growth, as all the 
works of God are, so far as we can un- 
derstand. Even the worlds commenced 
with a nucleus, and they gradually ac- 
cumulated and grew, as God ordained, 
until they filled the place that God had 
appointed. The kingdom of the latter 
days was to be like "the stone cut out 
of the mountain without hands," which 
was to grow and increase until it be- 
came a "great mountain and filled the 
whole earth." So on the 6th day of 
April, 1830, when the Church was for- 
mally organized, and the Prophet Jos- 
eph was accepted as the first Elder in 
the Church, and as a prophet, a seer 
and a revelator, and the people were 
commanded to observe all things that 
he brought forth by the power and 
Spirit of God — on that day there were 
not enough persons in the Church to or- 
ganize it in its fulness. It was like the 
little blade that comes out of the 
ground after the seed is planted; but 
as the years rolled on the Church in- 
creased in numbers, and the Lord 
brought into use the different men and 
women who came into the Church, that 
they might be utilized for the purpose 
of spreading the Gospel and building 



up His kingdom in the latter days. The 
Lord foreshadowed that at a certain- 
time there were to be Twelve that 
should be ordained to hold the keys of 
carrying the Gps.pel to the uttermost 
parts of the earth. And so various- 
quorums and organizations were added. 
They grew out of that organization 
that the Lord established in the begin- 
ning. The germ, the form, the potency 
of it was right there, but it was not de- 
veloped. It took time and circum- 
stances and people to bring it into a 
condition that it might be fully organ- 
ized according to the mind and will of 
the Lord. 

In the first place, the Lord gave the- 
Prophet Joseph Smith the presidency of 
the Church and the keys of this latter- 
day work. The Lord tested and tried 
him, to see whether he would stand, be- 
fore he conferred upon him the ful- 
ness of the power of the Holy Priest- 
hood to build up His kingdom in its 
fulness. I will read a verse or two 
from the 28th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, which shows how the 
Lord led along His servant in the be- 
ginning, and that this work was to- 
come forth by degrees. The Lord gave- 
a commandment to Oliver Cowdery as 
early as September, 1830, that he was 
to speak by the Holy Ghost, and that 
he should have the revelations of the 
Lord for himself and to aid him in his 
teachings; but although he had been or- 
dained an Apostle when the Prophet 
Joseph was ordained by Peter, James 
and John, he was not to command the 
man who stood at the head. The Lord 
said: 

"And thou shalt not command him 
who is at thy head, and at the head of 
the church; 

"For I have given him the keys of the 
mysteries, and the revelations which 
are sealed, until I shall appoint unto' 
them another in his stead." 

Here is the possibility set forth that 
if Joseph was not true and faithful in 
all things, another might be appointed 
in his stead; and Oliver was command- 
ed not to counsel him or to attempt to 
command him, but to receive the word 
of the Lord as it came from him. 

In the 35th section of the Doctrine 



ELDER CHARLES W. PENROSE. 



39 



and Covenants — a revelation given to 
Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon — the 
Lord said: 

"And I have given unto him the keys 
of the mystery of those things which 
have been sealed, even things which 
were from the foundation of the world, 
and the things which shall come from 
this time until the time of my coming, 
if he abide in me, and if not, another 
will I plant in his stead." 

This revelation was given in Decem- 
ber, 1830. and there are two or three 
more of the same kind, given in the 
very beginning of the Church, while the 
Prophet Joseph was, as it were, on 
probation before the Lord. The Lord 
gave him authority and put him into 
positions where he could be,. tried and 
tested, and He said, "If he abide not 
in me, another will I plant in his stead." 

I will read the 2nd verse of Section 65: 

"The keys of the kingdom of God 
are committed unto man on the earth, 
and from thence shall the gospel roll 
forth unto the ends of the earth, 
as the stone which is cut out of the 
mountain without hands shall roll forth 
until it has filled the whole earth." 

Now I will read from the 43rd Sec- 
tion, verses 3 to 7: 

"And this ye shall know .assuredly 
that there is none other appointed unto 
you to receive commandments and rev- 
elations until he be taken, if he abide 
in me. 

'But verily, verily, I say unto you, 
that none else shall be appointed unto 
this gift except it be through him, for 
if it be taken from him, he shall not 
have power except to appoint another 
in his stead; 

"And this shall be a law unto you, 
that ye receive not the teachings of 
any that shall come before you as reve- 
lations or commandments; 

"And this I give unto you that you 
may not be deceived, that you may 
know they are not of me. 

"For verily I say unto you, that he 
that is ordained of me shall come in at 
the gate and be ordained as I have told 
you before, to teach those revelations 
which you have received and shall re- 
ceive through him whom I have ap- 
pointed." 

There is still, you will see, the opening 
left that if Joseph was not true and 
faithful and worthy of his calling, an- 
other might be appointed in his stead. 
But I want you to mark this point: 
there was not to be another appointed 
in his stead if he abided in the Lord. 



It was only if he transgressed and be- 
came unworthy of his calling that he 
should have power to appoint another. 
Just put that down in your minds. So 
if dividers declare that somebody else 
was appointed to take the place of the 
Prophet Joseph, then they announce 
that the Prophet did not abide in the 
Lord, that he transgressed, and there- 
fore another had to be appointed in hid 
stead. 

In a revelation given to the Church 
September 11th, 1831, the Lord said: 

"I will be merciful unto you, for I 
have given unto you the kingdom. 

"And the keys of the mysteries of the 
kingdom shall not be taken from my 
servant Joseph Smith, Jr., through the 
means I have appointed, while he liv- 
e:h, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine or- 
dinances.— Doc. and Cov. Section 64, 
verses 4, 5. 

Here the promise was made to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith that he should 
have those keys as long as he lived, if 
he obeyed the commandments and or- 
dinances of the Lord. 

Our testimony is that he lived and 
died a prophet of God, and that he seal- 
ed his testimony with his blood. The 
Lord promised that the keys should not 
be taken from him while he lived, in- 
asmuch as he obeyed His ordinances, 
so when the Prophet Joseph was taken 
away, the keys were with him, as the 
Lord promised they should be, both in 
this world and in the world to come. I 
will read a verse from the 112th Sec- 
tion. The Lord says: 

"Now, I say unto you, and what I say 
unto you 1 say unto all the Twelve, 
Arise and gird up your loins, take up 
your cross, follow me, and feed my 
sheep. 

"Exalt not yourselves; rebel not 
against my servant Joseph, for verily 
I sav unto you, I am with him and 
my hand shall be over him; and the 
keys which I have given unto him, and 
also to youward, shall not be taken 
from him till I come." 

Here is the promise of the Lord, not 
only to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
but also to the Twelve, that the keys 
should not be taken from the Prophet 
until the Lord should come: for by this 
time he had been tested, proved, and 
found worthy. As he himself said, he 
had been swimming in deep waters and 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



up stream, and he had struggled against 
false friends and those surrounding him 
who professed to be his disciples, but 
who spoke against him and had risen 
up against him. ' Now the Lord said 
to him and to the Twelve, that the 
keys, which had been given first of all 
temporarily, as it' were, until he should 
be tested and proved, should abide with 
him until the Lord should come, and 
with the Twelve whom He had called 
and appointed. Therefore, rest your 
souls easy in this security, that the 
kingdom, as the Lord says, is giv- 
en to His people. I might read 
to you a dozen passages from the Doc- 
trine and Covenants showing that the 
kingdom was given to the Church, and 
it was to abide and continue. The 
Lord said "'I have sent my servants 
out to prune my vineyard for the last 
time, for behold this is the eleventh 
hour." His servants whom he had 
called into the vineyard were 
called for the last dispensation, 
and, He said, the keys should not be 
taken from the Prophet Joseph, 
for he had been tested and proved and 
found worthy before the Lord, before 
the angels and before the Church. They 
should not be taken from him and from 
the Twelve (that is the promise) "un- 
til I shall come, saith the Lord." So 
the keys were to abide with the Church 
from that time henceforth, until the 
Lord Himself should come and reign 
"in Zion and Jerusalem and before 
His ancients gloriously." As further 
evidence that this work was establishe l 
for the last time, the Lord says in 
the thirtieth verse of the same sec- 
tion: 

"For unto you (the Twelve), and 
those (the First Presidency) who are 
appointed with you, to be your coun- 
selors and your leaders, is the power 
of this Priesthood given, for the last 
days and for the last time, in the which 
Is the dispensation of the fulness of 
times." 

Here is the promise of the Lord to 
His servant Joseph and the Twelvn 
that were with him, that the keys were 
given unto them, and they were to hold 
them and exercise them, and they were 
given in the power of this Priesthood 
for the last time, in the last days, and 



for the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. 

Now, as the Church progressed, the 
Lord, as I before remarked, added or- 
ganizations and quorums, until the 
Church became perfectly established. 
The ear came forth in its beauty and 
glory. The little blade had measur- 
ably disappeared. "Mormonism," as I 
have said, is a growth. It is not the 
same today as it was yesterday; for 
it is growing, just like the flower that 
puts forth its leaves and its buds, and 
then its blossoms. It is the same plant, 
but it is continually changing, accord- 
ing to conditions and its environment 
and the necessity to develop itself in 
its beauty and glory. So also it is 
in the Church. Why, we have hardly 
attained the full corn in the ear yet. 
Every man read the 107th and the 124th 
Sections of the Doctrine and Covenants 
from beginning to end. If you do not 
have the book, buy one; and if you can- 
not buy one, borrow one. In the 107th 
Section the Lord reveals to the Church 
His Holy Priesthood— two Priesthoods, 
the Melchisedek and the Aaronic, which 
are one in reality, but divided into two 
branches. He says: 

"Of necessity there are presidents, or 
presiding offices growing out of, or ap- 
pointed of or from among those who are 
ordained to the several offices in these 
two priesthoods. 

"Of the Melchisedeck Priesthood three 
Presiding High Priests, chosen by the 
body, appointed and ordained to that 
office, and upheld by the confidence, 
faith and prayer of the church, form a 
quorum of the Presidency of the 
church." 

Does the Lord say there that some 
man is to appoint his brother, or his 
uncle, or his son, to preside over the 
Church? No. "Three presiding High 
Priests, chosen by the body," upheld 
and sustained by the vote and faith 
and fellowship of the Church, form 
the First Presidency. That is how the 
Presidency of the Church of Jesus 
Christ was established, by the revela- 
tion and commandment of God. That 
is how it has continued from that 
time until the present. When the 
Prophet Joseph was taken he had re- 
mained faithful and true, and he had

the keys of the latter-day dispensa- 
tion, and he has them today. And if 
you think that he has departed from 
this people, if you think that his in- 
fluence and power are withdrawn from 
the brethren here whom God has ap- 
pointed to preside over us in the 
Church, you are sadly mistaken. The 
spirit and power of Joseph are in this 
Church and with this Presidency. Jo- 
seph the Prophet, although he has gone 
from our midst, holds the keys of the 
last dispensation, and will hold them 
till the Lord comes. But there were 
others appointed to act in his stead, in 
the place he occupied in the flesh, and 
he still holds his priesthood and power 
and authority and the keys of the dis- 
pensation behind the veil. He is doing 
a far greater work there than he could 
accomplish in the flesh. He has a wider 
sphere of labor, and more pcwer and 
influence, now that the infirmities of the 
flesh are gone. He is clothed with thi 
power of the holy priesthood, and the 
keys thereof abide with him. And he 
Is with this people, for "the powers of 
this priesthood are inseparably con- 
nected with the powers behind the 
veil;" and they, united together, will 
prevail over every power and influence 
that may be brought against them. 

When the Prophet Joseph was taken, 
and the quorum of the First Presidency 
was thus dissolved, it devolved upon 
the Twelve. Read t this Section and 
you will find that the Lord gave to 
the Twelve authority to hold the keys, 
equal with the First Presidency— that 
is, when the First Presidency was dis- 
solved. The quorum of the Twelve came 
next, and they had power to set in 
order all the other offices in the Church. 
That is part of their duty, as the Lord 
has commanded in this section. There- 
fore, the Twelve came up, with Brig- 
ham Young at their head, the Lord hav- 
ing designated him by revelation to be 
the President of the Twelve, as you 
has commanded in this section. There- 
Doctrine and Covenants. God gave 
Hyrum to be the man to hold the key* 
of the patriarchal blessings over the 
whole Church; but He gave Joseph 
Smith to preside over the Church, the 
•whole Church— over Hyrum as well as 



the rest. He also gave him his coun- 
selors. Then He gave the Twelve, and 
He put Brigham Young at the head of 
the Twelve. God knew what was com- 
ing, and He so. ordered things that 
Brigham stood at the head of the 
Twelve; and when the Prophet Joseph, 
and the Prophet Hyrum, the Patri- 
arch, were taken, the Twelve came up 
in their place, as the Lord had ordained. 
Satan then had twelve to overcome in- 
stead of three. Furthermore, you will 
find in the same revelation, in Sectioa 
107, that even if the Twelve should all 
be taken away, then there are Seventy 
to come up. It puts^ <me in mind of 
the Irishman's wall. He built it five 
feet high and eight feet thick, and when 
they asked him the reason, he said tha* 
if the wind came and blowed it over it 
would be higher than it was before. 

Now, as to this Church — the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — 
the Lord laid its foundations broad and 
deep and high. He made it impreg- 
nable. Why? Because He had ordained 
in the beginning that it should be per- 
petual, that it should not be overcome, 
that it should not be left to another 
people, that the keys of the priesthood 
should continue and abide until Christ 
should come and reign over the earth. 
So the Lord ordained, in the order of 
the priesthood, that when the First 
Presidency was dissolved, the Twelve 
should succeed, having all the keys, 
power and authority to regulate the 
Church and to organize the quorums. 
Thus it was that President Young and 
the Twelve conducted the affairs of the 
Church for some time. There nvas a 
majority of the Twelve who ptood 
faithful, who were ready to do their 
duty, and the Lord s ays that' "a ma- 
jority may form a quorum" when it 
is impossible to have them all together. 
The vacant places were filled up in the 
quorum; and when the proper time 
came, President Young, who was a Pre- 
siding High Priest (so are all the 
Twelve— God's High Priests— a presid- 
ing traveling High Council), and his 
two counselors, were upheld and sus- 
tained by the vote and faith and fel- 
lowship of the Church, and formed the 



42 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Presidency of the Church, in the, way 
God had appointed. 

So it has been from that time to the 
present, my brethren and sisters. When- 
ever a vacancy has occurred, it has 
been filled. For the power of growth 
is in the Church. The power to regu- 
late all its affairs is in the Church. 
The power to purge out all that is evil 
is in the Church. We need no outside 
pressure, or counsel, or instruction. All 
that is necessary is right within the 
Church. As we were told by Brother! 
Lyman, it is a living thing, a living 
organism, quickened by the power of 
the Holy Spirit, and it is the word of 
the Lord that is proclaimed through 
its leaders-. And so we have had tha 
quorum of the First Presidency or- 
ganized according to the will and com- 
mandment of God from that day to the 
present. I testify to you, before the 
Lord, that the truth which God has 
given to this Church shall continue and 
abide, that the keys of the holy priest- 
hood sent down out of heaven in the 
last days for the last time, will not be 
taken away again from the earth; that 
as the priesthood of Aaron will remain 
"until the sons of Levi do offer unto the 
Lord an offering in righteousness," so 
the keys of the Melchisedek Priesthood 
shall remain and abide until Christ, 
who is the great High Priest shall come 
and stand at our head, and be our King. 

I know that this truth abides in the 
hearts of the people; but we ought not 
to allow any of our friends who are 
not strong in the testimony to be led 
astray by anything that may come 
along to lessen their faith and to weak- 
en them. Let us be one. We have 
been one in these valleys. There never 
was a better spirit in the Church since 
I have known it, and I have been a 
minister in it for nearly 55 years. I 
know that the Spirit of God is with 
this people, and I have never enjoyed 
it better than I have during this con- 
ference. The Spirit of the living God 
has been present and inspired the ut- 
terances of those who have spoken, and 
they have found a place in the hearts 
of the people. The Saints have re- 
joiced. Why? Because the Lord is 



with us. My brethren and sisters, this 
is His work, not the work of man, and 
He will cause it to prevail. How ab- 
surd it would be for the Lord, after He 
had established His Church on foun- 
dations of perpetuity, to allow it to 
lapse, to remain dormant for a number 
of years, when the very keys that He 
had given that the Church might be 
perpetuated were still held by the 
Twelve and the brethren associated 
with them. The idea that the Lord 
would allow the Church to go to sleep 
and into darkness when He had de- 
clared it should stand forever, would 
be folly. But the Lord has been with 
His people and with His servants. Do 
we not know that the Lord was with 
Brother Brigham when he led the 
Saints out of trouble and bondage in 
the east, across the great plains, and 
planted the Church in these mountain 
valleys, and prepared the way for the 
building up of the great community 
and the Zion which the Prophet Joseph 
foresaw, for he talked about it and ap- 
pointed men to go and prospect the 
land, that "the Saints might become a 
great people in the midst of the Rocky 
Mountains," that Zion might flourish 
upon the hills. 

The Church is still growing. The 
ear is still growing, and the full corn 
in the ear will be seen when Christ 
shall come. We have all the keys and 
powers necessary for that, right in the 
Church. Its organization is complete, 
with a Presidency, with Apostles, Sev- 
enties, High Priests, Elders, Priests, 
Teachers and Deacons, with the auxil- 
iary societies which the Lord has in- 
spired His servants to establish, both 
for the brethren and the sisters, that 
the women as well as the men might 
have something to do in building up 
this great latter day work. It is beau- 
tiful, it is glorious, it is perfect: for 
it has come from the hands of the Al- 
mighty. We are imperfect, we are 
feeble, we are not all fully carrying out 
that which God has placed upon us; 
but we will try, will we not? to do 
our duty. Let every man learn hia 
duty in the Priesthood. Let every wo- 
man learn her duty in the organiza- 



BRIGHAM 

tions of the Church. Let us all per- 
form our duties as members of the 
Church, meet tog-ether often, partake 
of the sacrament, remember our pray- 
ers, teach our children the principles 
of the Gospel of Christ and plant in 
their hearts that faith which has given 
us so much joy, satisfaction and con- 
tentment, and the work of the Lord 
shall go onward and shall prevail; the 
truth shall be carried to every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people, the honest 
in heart shall rejoice among the na- 
tions, the poor among men shall re- 
joice in the Holy One of Israel, the 
Lord will bring to shame the mocker 
and the scornful, the wisdom of this 
world shall come to naught and the 
understanding of the prudent shall be 
hid, but the honest and upright of 
heart shall rejoice in the Lord, the 
truth shall prevail, and the kingdom 
of our God shall come and His will be 
done on the earth as it is done in heav- 
en, when "the meek inherit the earth 
and the wicked are cut off forever." 
God help us to be faithful azid true, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"One Hundred Years," a quartet com- 
posed by Prof. Stephens, to commem- 
orate the one hundredth anniversary 
of the Prophet's birth, was rendered

D. Pyper and Horace S. Ensign. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

Of necessity the> subjects that are 
considered at our conferences are varied 
and numerous, in consequence of the 
work of the Lord being so extensive 
and consisting of both temporal and 
spiritual things. The Spirit of the Lord 
moves upon His servants to address 
themselves to the various interests in 
which the Church is concerned; and I 
hav-i taken pleasure in noting that all 
the interests and all the departments of 
work in the Church generally receive 
that word that is seasonable to each be- 
fore the conference is concluded. 

Much has been said during this con- 
ference concerning the opposition that 
is waged against the work of God, and 
by the remarks made I have been re- 
minded of a saying current in France 
to the effect that for a man guilty of 



[. ROBERTS. 4.3 

crime two courses only lie before him: 
one is confession, the other is suicide; 
and they add, "suicide is confession." 
So -with those who feel disposed to at- 
tack this work. They may attack the 
administration of it, or they may at- 
tack its fundamental doctrines and seek 
to disprove it altogether; and in either 
event the attempt will end in failure 
as surely as confession or suicide ends 
in one result. To attack the adminis- 
tration of the work of the Lord under 
our present circumstances, in this year 
of grace 1905, is vain; for the testimony 
of all who have spoken and the testi- 
mony in the hearts of the Saints of 
God bear witness that there never was 
a time in the history of the church, 
when individual liberty was more re- 
spected than now, and when the nec- 
essarily great administrative power in 
thf' presiding officer was exercised in 
more moderation. So that to my mind! 
those who assail the administration of 
this work proclaim their own unwis- 
dom and fret out only their own folly. 
To attack the Church in its fundamen- 
tal doctrines is useless; for they are- 
invulnerable, and not to be overthrown, 
by the efforts of the ungodly to dis- 
prove their truth. Therefore, if these 
people who interest themselves in our 
concerns will take a word of advice, I 
would suggest, in the language of one 
of old, that they would best let this 
work alone; for if it be of man, it will 
come to naught of itself; and if it be 
of God, they cannot do aught against 
it, and possibly they may find them- 
selves fighting against God. 

The Apostle Paul, in his, epistle to the 
Ephesians, told them that the Lord had 
revealed to him that in the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times God wouftl 
gather together in one all things in 
Christ, both things which are in heaven 
and things which are in earth, even in 
Him. I do not know that I quote this^ 
scripture for the purpose of having it 
foreshadow at all the line of thought 
that I would like to follow; but I be- 
lieve it is profitable to remember in 
these great assemblies of the Church 
that we are living in that dispensation, 
of the fulness of times, in which God 



44 



G EXE UAL. CONFERENCE. 



has promised to gather together in one 
all things in Christ, both in heaven and 
in earth. 

Accepting the doctrine as true that 
we are living and operating in that dis- 
pensation, and that to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith was accorded the supreme 
honor of introducing that last dispen- 
sation — that dispensation which should 
culminate in the redemption of tha 
earth and in the salvation of men; rec- 
ognizing the truth, as pointed out in 
the remarks of Elder Penrose, that this 
institution of the kingdom is not to be 
left to other people, but is to grow and 
increase in the earth until it should fill 
the whole earth and the kingdoms of 
this world become the kingdoms of our 
God and His Christ— after admitting 
these premises, for anyone to suppose 
that after that glorious dispensation 
had made but a few steps forward in 
the unfolding of its greatness it was 
suddenly halted to wait for someone to 
grow from childhood to manhood, is 
of all follies the most supreme. I call 
your attention for a few moments to 
the very palpable evidences that may be 
seen and read of all men that there has 
been no halting in this work, no ces- 
sation in its growth and development, 
from the days of the Prophet Joseph 
until the present time. And I base mv 
remarks upon the facts in the case; 
upon the word of God and His promise 
unto His people, given at a time when 
the fortunes of the Church were sunk- 
en to the lowest point in its history — I 
refer to the promise given to the Saints 
of God in 1834, in the month of Febru- 
ary, when some twelve hundred of them 
had been exiled from Jackson County 
and were bivouacked on the Missouri 
bottoms, in most helpless circum- 
stances. In that dark hour the voice of 
the Lord came to His Prophet and 
spoke these words: 

"Verily I say unto you, that I have 
decreed a decree which my people shall 
realize, inasmuch as they hearken from 
this very hour unto the counsel which 
I, the Lord their God, shall give unto 
them. 

Behold they shall, for I have decreed 
it, begin to prevail against mine ene- 
mies from this very hour, 

And by hearkening to observe all the 



words which I, the Lord their God, 
shall speak unto them, they shall never 
cease to prevail until the kingdoms of 
the world are subdued under my feet, 
and the earth is given unto the saints, 
to possess it for ever and ever." 

That was the promise of the Lord 
given unto the saints; and I say 
that the repeated triumphs of the 
Church over their enemies, notwith- 
standing the trials through which the 
Church has passed, the conditions that 
prevail in these 55 stakes of Zion rep- 
resented in this conference, are the 
proof positive that God has vindicated 
His promise, so. far as increasing the 
number of the Saints is concerned and 
multiplying the stakes of Zion; and 
the number and condition of the Saints 
in these stakes is evidence that they 
have, largely at least, lived in har- 
mony with the conditions named in the 
revelation upon which they were to 
have success over God's enemies. It is 
true, of course, that a few years after 
this revelation was given the Saints 
were again driven from their posses- 
sions in the state of Missouri; but mark 
this difference between the first expul- 
sion that took place in our history — 
the expulsion from Jackson county — 
and the expulsion from Missouri five 
years later; 1,200 were driven from 
Jackson county in 1833, but when the 
Church was moved from Missouri 12,000 
or 15,000 people were exiled. The work 
of God then certainly had not ceased 
to grow. It was the turning over of 
Elder Penrose's wall, so built as to be 
higher when turned over than before. 
The proclamation of the Gospel had 
been fruitful, and thousands had been 
brought unto a knowledge of the truth 
between the two expulsions. It is true 
also, that a few years later another 
exodus was forced upon the people. 
Expatriation took place, and our fath- 
ers were compelled to leave the beauti- 
ful city upon the banks of the Missis- 
sippi and come into this desert, moun- 
tain waste. But this time when they 
moved the Church they moved some- 
thing over 20,000! And then, if such 
a thing were to be thought possible that 
we must again move.they would have to 
move something like 300.000 people from 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS.

these mountains! So that in the mat- 
ter of numbers, at least, there has been 
no retrogression in this work. It has 
steadily increased. The testimony of 
the Elders of Israel has been accom- 
panied by the witness of God. It has 
appealed to the honest in heart, and in 
nearly all the nations of the earth there 
has been found a response. The gather- 
ing has continued until behold, the 
Saints have their feet made fast in 
these valleys of the Rocky mountains, 
where, in fulfillment of the prediction 
of the Prophet Joseph himself, the Lat- 
ter-day Saints have become a great and 
a powerful people. 

In the matter of preaching the Gos- 
pel the work has not slackened. We 
have been true to that missionary spirit 
impressed upon the people who re- 
ceived the Gospel in the commence- 
ment. The history of the Church is 
unique in this, it seems to me, that 
every time our fortunes have fallen 
lowest we have turned to the preaching 
of the Gospel as a means of 
relief, and through the procla- 
mation of it have found renewed 
strength and added increased vigor to 
the work of God. You remember, do 
you not, the first foreign mission that 
was conceived and executed in the 
Church? In those dark days, when 
clouds of jspinitual darkness (settled 
upon Kirtland, and men whom the Pro- 
phet had trusted fell upon the right and 
upon the left and were filled with bit- 
terness and hatred towards him — you 
remember how the Spirit whispered to 
him that some new move must be 
made for the salvation of the Church, 
and he was prompted by the Spirit to 
send word to Heber C. Kimball that 
the voice of the Spirit of the Lord in- 
dicated that he must carry the Gospel 
message to a foreign land; and it was 
done; for Heber C. Kimball opened the 
work in England. Then, after |the 
exodus from Missouri, before the Saints 
were yet settled permanently in Com- 
merce, while the bulk of the Church 
was living in wagons, tents and other 
temporary homes, behold, a mission for 
the Twelve, to go abroad and proclaim 
the Gospel! Leaving their families in 



utmost poverty, "many of them in sick- 
ness, and the Twelve themselves sick, 
they drew to themselves the spiritual 
strength of this work and went forth 
as messengers cf life and salvation. 
Again, true to this spirit characteristic 
of the Church when it was presided 
over by the Prophet Joseph, when the 
pioneers landed in this valley and be- 
gan to settle this city and the sur- 
rounding country, before there had 
been any great development of material 
resources, the Twelve are again called 
out of this desert land, not only to 
preach the Gospel in England, but in 
Prance, Germany, Italy and Scandi- 
navia. Thus this spirit of proclaiming 
those truths that God has deposited 
with the Church was characteristic of 
the Church when it settled in these 
mountains. These missions were ap- 
pointed unto the especial witnesses of 
the Lord Jesus Christ— to the Twelve 
Apostles. Lorenzo Snow went to Italy, 
John Taylor to Germany and France, 
Erastus Show to Scandinavia; and 
from all these lands sons and daughters 
of God have been brought into the fold 
of Christ. 

A week or two ago I attended a ser- 
vice held in this city, in which the 
Church of Christ was arraigned for 
having by its conduct so pre- 
judiced the world that they would 
not listen to the message that we 
had to deliver, and in solemn tones we 
were warned that somebody was re- 
sponsible for that condition of things. 
Oh, how my heart swelled with joy 
when he who uttered those words and 
that warning was present at the opening 
session of this conference and listened 
to the report of the President of the 
Church concerning the missionary work 
carried on in all lands by the Elders 
of the Church; that the harvest was so 
great and the laborers so few , that 
although we had nearly fifteen hundred 
Elders in the field— and keep about that 
number out from year to year — yet this 
host of the servants of God were not 
able to meet the demands that are made 
for the proclamation of the Gospel. It 
seems to me that we are in a pretty 
good condition to meet all the respon- 



46 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



sibility that we may be warned about 
concerning this matter. 

Take it in the matter of publishing to 
the world the American volume of 
scripture, the Book of Mormon — 
one of the incidents, we may 
say, with which this great work com- 
menced in the earth. Who is it that has 
published that work in some ten or 
twelve different languages; and to as 
many or more nations? It is the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
And the end is not yet; for we heard 
the explanation of President Anthon 
H. Lund, wherein he told us in this 
conference that still more translations 
of this work were in contemplation, in 
the Turkish and other languages. So 
that we have been steadily employed in 
giving to the world this new volume of 
God's word. Our hands have not been 
slackened with reference to sending 
abroad the word of God as it was 
known to the Nephites upon this conti- 
nent, thus fulfiling the decree of God 
that the inhabitants of the earth should 
not only have the testimony of the 
Jews, but that they should have the 
testimony of the Nephites also, and 
through them they should learn that 
Jesus is the Christ. I say the Church 
has been most faithful in publishing the 
word of God to the inhabitants of the 
earth. 

Another item. During the last few 
months of the Prophet's earthly career, 
the one subject which rested upon his 
mind more than any other was the sub- 
ject of the salvation for the dead, the 
building of the Nauvoo Temple, the 
erection of a baptismal font and a house 
in which the keys of the holy Priest- 
hood might be given to the servants of 
the Lord, where they might receive 
their conversations, as described in one 
of the later revelations to the Prophet, 
wherein they might receive that spir- 
itual instruction that should better 
equip them for the work of the ministry 
which God had laid upon them. This 
was the burden of his discourses, this 
the burden of his' letters written to the 
Church from his place of exile, while 
being compelled to hide from the offi- 
cers of the law under the false accusa- 



tion of having transgressed the law— 
parenthetically: the Prophet Joseph was 
as frequently in that condition, aye, 
more frequently than any of the breth- 
ren have been since. But this temple 
work was the one thing that seemed to 
press most heavily upon him just pre- 
vious to his death. Have this people 
been true to that spirit of temple build- 
ing and temple work? Let this monu- 
ment of granite to the east of us, a col- 
lective discourse in stone by the Latter- 
day Saints, bear witness to the world 
that we have been true to 
that part of the work which 
was of such importance in the 
mind of the Prophet. Let the stone 
temple in St. George bear a similar tes- 
timony. Let the splendid temple in 
Sanpete county be another witness; and 
the one at Logan in the north, let it 
also testify to the same fact. Bring 
forth the records of those temples, and 
let the millions of baptisms for the 
dead answer whether this people have 
been true to the mission, in the redemp- 
tion of the dead, which God has placed 
upon the Church. Let the records of 
sealings of husbands to wives, wives to 
husbands, children to parents and par- 
ents to children — let the hundreds of 
thousands of ministrations of this kind 
bear witness to the faithfulness of the 
people of God to this doctrine advanced 
by our Prophet in the last days. I say 
that the blending together, or, if vou 
will, in the language of Paul, the gath- 
ering together of all things in earth 
as well as of things in heaven; the 
uniting together of the past with the 
present, of the fathers with the child- 
ren, is one of the most stupendous facts 
connected with this great work of the 
Lord in the last days. Do you not re- 
member that this doctrine, which is now 
so gloriously developed among us, was 
a matter of early concern to the Pro- 
phet Joseph? This work was foreshad- 
owed in the very first interview the 
Prophet had with Moroni, for he quot- 
ed the words of Malachi, though a lit- 
tle different from what they are in the 
Bible, to the effect that the Lord would 
soon reveal the Priesthood by the hand 
of Elijah, and the hearts of the children 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 



shall be turned to the fathers, 
and the hearts of the fathers 
to the children. If it were not so, 
"he said, all would be consumed at the 
Lord's coming-. After that, step by step, 
line upon line, precept upon precept, 
this doctrine was delivered, until it has 
borne fruit in the manner that I have 
indicated to you by the administra- 
tion of the ordinances of the Priesthood, 
wherein the power of godliness is made 
manifest, and without which ordinances 
of the Priesthood, we are informed, the 
power of God is not made manifest. 

So that we have been carrying out 
the projected work of the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith in this respect. 

One other thing I desire to call your 
attention to. The President, in his op- 
ening remarks, rejoiced that we were 
taking a course that at least displeased 
the devil, or his advocates. I remem- 
ber in this connection a saying of Pres- 
ident Young's. He said, Tou may feel 
pretty safe as long as the devil takes 
exception to what you are doing, for he 
is not disposed to approve of righteous- 
ness, or to complain if through unright- 
eousness you play into his hands. Now 
then, it may be a miserable sort of 
evidence to refer to in connection with 
a theme so glorious as this, and yet 
I cannot quite resist the temp- 
tation to let him furnish a little 
evidence; and I do it in this way: Has 
not the same bitterness and hatred 
that characterized the Church under 
the presidency of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, the same determination to de- 
stroy the Church, followed the Church 
led to the mountains by the Twelve 
Apostles under President Brigham 
Young? Has not the same spirit char- 
acterized their ministrations among the 
inhabitants of the earth? Surely you 
know the Saints had no rest in the 
days of the Prophet Joseph. His life 
was one continual scene of conflict and 
contest with the powers of darkness, 
who sought to destroy him and also the 
work which God had ordained that 
he should bring forth. At every turn 
we have been confronted with the self- 
same enemy. From the fact that that 
enemy recognized the Church of Christ 



47 

in these mountains we may gather some 
evidence that this is the continued 
work of God. It was not the Elders of 
any of the so-called dissenting factions 
that have met mobbings and whippings 
in various countries of the world; It 
was not any of their representatives 
that were shot down in the State of 
Georgia, or the State of Tennessee. No; 
they were representatives of the Churdh 
of Christ in these mountains — the men 
who held the Priesthood — divine au- 
thority — and stood for the truth, and 
the fulness thereof. 

But I do not know that we ought to 
concern ourselves too much about these" 
matters, though it makes one rather re- 
joice to see the work of God grow and 
nourish, notwithstanding all the opposi- 
tion that is aroused against it; to see 
stakes multiplied, missions increased, 
and the people grow in grace and in the 
knowledge of the truth, despite the ef- 
forts of the adversary. You will par- 
don me, I hope, for glorifying a little in 
the failure of our enemies, as well a^s 
rejoicing a great deal in the success 
of the work of God. 

I do not know whether I can make a 
thought I have in mind clear to you 
or not, but I am going to try. It has 
only passed through my mind a few 
times, and I do not know whether I 
have it well digested. As I pointed 
out in the commencement, we are living 
in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times, in the which would be gathered 
together in one all things in heaven and 
in earth. Repeatedly the brethren have 
borne testimony that this work, in pur- 
suance of the promises of God, should 
not be left to other people. It is not 
going to fail. In past dispensations 
there has been a seeming triumph for 
the powers of darkness, and I have oft- 
en wondered how Paul could possibly 
continue to labor with such energy 
when he had such clear conceptions, by 
the spirit of prophecy, that the time 
would come when an evil power would 
arise, which should exalt himself above 
all that is called God, sitting in the 
temple of God, and showing himself 
that he was God— that is.usurping God's 
authority and ruling men with a rod of 



4S

iron. Paul had the clearest conceptions, 
it seems to me, that the time would not 
be long- before clouds of spiritual dark- 
ness would rest down upon the people. 
And so, in dispensations preceding that 
of the meridian of time, one after an- 
other they seem to have failed of per- 
manently maintaining themselves in the 
earth. But now at last we have the 
sure word of God that His work shall 
be established no more to be destroyed 
nor given to another people. What I 
want to call your attention to is, that 
this idea is in harmony with the age in 
which we live. Our civilization has 
taken on a promise of permanency, 
the like of which did not characterize 
the civilizations of former days. The 
great Greek civilization was overthrown 
to a great extent by the success of the 
Roman arms. True, in time it reas- 
serted itself, and by their civilization 
the Greeks are general^ conceded to 
have subdued Rome. Rome in turn 
declined, and finally fell under the re- 
peated assaults and waves of immigra- 
tion of barbarous tribes from beyond 
the Danube, from the far north and 
northeast. This was the fate of the 
western division of the Roman empire. 
Later, in the fifteenth century, this 
was the fate also of the eastern divi- 
sion; for the terrible Seljuk Turks re- 
peated the success over the eastern em- 
pire, that the German tribes won over 
the western. So the whole Roman civ- 
ilization was crushed. And through all 
the ages civilizations have gone down 
and others have arisen in their place. 
But today the civilization of this age 
seems to have based on better founda- 
tions. Judge it by human wisdom, at 
least, one would say that we had ar- 
rived at a state of preservation of all 
light, truth and knowledge that has 
been confided into the human con- 
sciousness through the intellectual ef- 
forts of those who devote themselves 
to thought, science and philsosophy. 
There exists nowhere on the face of 
the round globe the barbarous tribes 



that ca» possibly overwhelm the knowl- 
edge and the civilization of the present 
age. And I believe that this perma- 
nency in civilization, the prospect of 
preservation of the light and truth that 
have been given unto the children of 
men, ought to be and necessarily will 
be accompanied by spiritual truth, 
spiritual philosophy, a true and per- 
manent religion, that shall move side by 
side with this permanent civilization 
until it brings to pass the redemption 
of the children of men. So that this 
dispensation of the Gospel is in har- 
mony with all other things with which 
we are surrounded. It promises perma- 
nency of civilization, and the preserva- 
tion of all the knowledge that has been 
developed through the experience and 
researches of men as well as through 
the revelations of truth to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. But I would say to 
those who pride themselves upon their 
attainments in science — and from the 
magnitude of their achievements I do 
not deny that they have a right to feel 
a little proud; I would say to those who 
glory in the philosophy that they have 
developed — and they too may well be 
proud of their achievements — I say un- 
to them, scientists and philosophers 
alike, You are but lamely limping along 
far in the rear of the far-flung thought 
line of what God revealed through His 
servants the prophets. I will not have 
time to develop that thought; but I re- 
joice in the prospective triumph of the 
truth. We are going to win. We will 
not fail as a community, as an organi- 
zation. Individuals, through human 
weakness and inclination to evil, may 
offend the Spirit of God and fail, as 
individuals; but as the throne of God 
stands sure so stands sure the founda- 
tions of this work and the structure 
that God is rearing upon it. That is my 
testimony in the name of Jesus. Amen.

THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, Oct. 8, 10 a. m. 

The choir sang the hymn beginning: 

Ccme, dearest Lord, descend and dwell, 
By faith and love^ in every breast; 

Then shall we know, and taste and feel, 
The joys that cannot be expressed. 

Prayer was offered by Bishop Orrin 
P. Miller. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Rouse 
oh ye mortals, the dawn is near." 

ELDER RULOX S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters, I rise before 
you this morning in response to a call 
from President Smith, and I can as- 
sure you that it is with a feeling of 
great timidity, and unless our Father 
shall come to my support 1 feel wholly 
unequal to the task that has been as- 
signed to me. I feel now, as I have al- 
ways felt, deep interest in the great 
work of our Father in heaven, which 
He has instituted for the salvation of 
His children here upon the earth, and a 
testimony of its divine truth burns in 
my heart at this very moment. To me 
the meetings of this conference have 
been in very deed spiritual feasts. The 
Spirit of the Lord has been poured out 
abundantly upon Hi|s servants who 
have addressed the congregations, and I 
feel that the people themselves enter- 
tain the same view that I have ex- 
pressed. Indeed the gathering of the 
people this morning is a sufficient guar- 
antee of this truth, and I rejoice that 
even this great Tabernacle is not suffi- 
cient to hold the Latter-day Saints who 
have come up hither to hear the word of 
the Lord, insomuch that it has become 
nfecess^ry* notwithstanding ;the fact 
that the elements have been somewhat 
threatening, to hold an overflow meet- 
ing in order to accommodate the people 
who have come in such great numbers 



to hear His holy word. It speaks well 
for the faith and for the interest that 
the Latter-day Saints have in the work 
of the Lord. 

It has been said, during this confer- 
ence, that the Latter-day Saints are a 
peculiar people, and sometimes I have 
wondered in what did this peculiarity 
consist. Wherever we go we find that 
we are somewhat different from the 
rest of mankind, so much so that we 
are pointed out and observed. In fact, 
we might say we are the observed of 
all observers when we go out into the 
world. Many times people have accost- 
ed me and spoken in reference to our 
missionaries. When I was in the mis- 
sionary field they have said to me, 
"Your men are different from ours; they 
seem to be a different class of people." 
Why is it? Is it not the effect that 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ is produc- 
ing among the Latter-day Saints? In 
our own community we do not realize 
the great change that has taken place 
in us since we have become identified 
with this peculiar religion. If we are 
living in harmony with the teachings of 
the Gospel it will have the effect to 
make those peculiarities still more pro- 
nounced. There is an influence that 
goes with the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
that is felt among the people of the 
world with whom we associate. I do 
not wish to convey the idea that we 
have so far advanced and become so 
perfect that we claim to be holier than 
the rest of mankind, but I do wish to 
convey the idea that there has been an 
effect wrought upon this community as 
a direct result of our religion. It has 
opened the eyes of our understanding. 
It has caused us to look at life from 
an entirely different aspect. We have 
been enlightened by the power of the 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Holy Ghost that was conferred upon 
us when we entered into covenant with 
the Lord. The peculiarity that is mora 
prominent with us than all others is the 
spirit of love. The spirit of the Gospel 
is the spirit of love, and there have 
been exhibitions of that love in the 
whole career of the Latter-day Saints. 

In pursuance of this quality which so 
distinguishes us from other peoples in 
the world, our young- men leave their 
fathers and their mothers, their wives 
and children, and go out into the world 
without remuneration to proclaim the 
glad message of great joy. Oh! what a 
wonderful manifestation of love to- 
wards their fellow men. "Where in all 
the world can such a thing be found, 
other than among the Latter-day 
Saints? There may be isolated instances 
of great devotion on the part of men 
who are sincere and honest in their mo- 
tives, but where upon the face of the 
whole earth will you find a whole com- 
munity who are willing to make this 
sacrifice because of the love which they 
hold toward their fellowmen? Th^ 
spirit of this work, the spirit that im- 
pels these young men to go out into 
the world, distinguishes them wher- 
ever they go and manifests itself in the 
spirit of love. You do not hear of the 
missionaries of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints being full 
of hatred and venom and seeking whom 
they can destroy; you do not find them 
laying traps, or disseminating false- 
hood, or doing that which will bring 
their opponents into discomfort. No; 
you will find them laboring for the sal- 
vation of the souls of the children of 
men. You will find them going from 
door to door, holding forth upon the 
corners of the streets, and en- 
countering all kinds of opposition. 
You will find them proclaiming the 
fact that God has spoken from heaven 
and restored to earth His everlasting 
Gospel. You will find them traveling 
without purse and without scrip, 
oftimes going hungry and submitting 
to great indignities and privations. 
These are not acts of men filled with 
the spirit of hate, but they are im- 
pelled by the spirit of love, a spirit to 



benefit and bless their fellowmen. 
There is a spirit of peace that acom- 
panies them in their ministrations; 
there is an influence, which they carry 
with them that they themselves seem 
to be unconscious of. They do not 
realize the great force and influence 
that is with them when they go out 
into the world. The influence that im- 
pels the Latter-day Saints, as I said 
before, is the spirit of the Gospel, 
which is the spirit of love. God is love, 
and if we possess His Holy Spirit it 
will manifest itself in acts of love. 1 
do not know how I can more specifical- 
ly illustrate the feeling that is pos- 
sesed in such measure by the Latter- 
day Saints. Nevertheless. I will say 
this, that the man who is in posses- 
sion of the Spirit of the Lord carries 
with him an influence that is a strange 
thing in the world, and it will cause 
those who come in contact with him 
to recognize the fact that he is differ- 
ent from the majority of mankind. 

In the 121st section of the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants you will 
find these words: 

45. Let thy bowels aiso be full of 
charity towards all men. and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue gar- 
nish thy thoughts unceasingly, then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the 
presence of God, and the doctrine of 
the Priesthood shall distill upon thy 
soul as the dews from Heaven. 

46. The Holy Ghost shall be thy 
constant companion, and thy sceptre 
an unchanging sceptre of righteous- 
ness and truth, and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and with- 
out compulsory means it shall flow unto 
thee for ever and ever. 

In these words you find a corrobor- 
ation of that which I have said. If the 
Latter-day Saints will allow their 
hearts to go out in sympathy and love 
for their fellowmen, and especially for 
the household of faith, their faith will 
grow stronger day by day, they will 
increase in the knowledge of God, and 
their confidence shall wax strong Id 
His presence, and this doctrine of the 
Priesthood shall distill upon their souls 
as the dews from Heaven. Their whole 
being will be lit up by the power of the 
Spirit of God, and this power will make 
itself felt among the people of the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



51 



world. This is the great advantage 
we have received in yielding obedience 
to the Gospel. It is in this regard 
that we are different from the rest of 
mankind. That is not saying there are 
not millions of good people upon the 
face of the earth who desire to do the 
will of the Lord. But I would say to 
such that if they will also accept the 
truth as it has been revealed from 
Heaven, the same power, the same gifts 
and the same influence, will distin- 
guish them from the rest of mankind. 
It is the marvelous power of the Holy 
Spirit; the doctrine of the Priesthood 
distilling upon the souls of those who 
allow their hearts to go out in sym- 
pathy and love toward their fellowmen, 
and who manifest that love in going 
out into the world to proclaim the 
truth as it has been revealed from 
Heaven. It is the same love that im~ 
bued the Savior of the world when He 
gave His life for the salvation of men. 
Greater love than this hath no man, 
that he will lay down his life for his 
friends. It is that love that impelled 
the Prophet Joseph Smith to lay down 
his life and to go as a lamb to the 
slaughter. It is that love that impels 
the servants of the Lord in this day to 
take their lives in their hands and go 
into the world, which is so full of 
hatred and prejudice against the work 
of the Lord. Those whom we fmd in 
the world rising up against the Latter- 
day Saints, what justification can they 
find in that? What spirit is it that im- 
bues the men and women who dissem- 
inate falsehood and misstatements, 
which have the result of arousing preju- 
dice and hatred toward the Latter-day 
Saints? What spirit is it that impels 
men and women to rai3e their voices 
against men whom the/ know to be 
honorable and men of virtu-i and in- 
tegrity, for the purpose of blackening 
their characters, and making them ap- 
pear in the eyes of the world men of 
the vilest character? 

Contrast this spirit with the sp-rit 
that animates our missionaries. It 
seems to be the heritage o f the Saints 



to be hated of the world, and to have 
all manner of evil spoken against them 
falsely. It was so in the case of the 
Savior Himself. It was so with other 
Prophets and holy men who have 
spoken under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of God. It is that which has 
helped to distinguish them in the dif- 
ferent periods of the world's history. 
They have always stood out prominent 
among the inhabitants of the earth, 
and their names have been had for 
good and for evil in all the world. The 
name of the Savior Himself was iiad 
for good and evil. The prophets of God 
have been despised and hated and 
.stoned to death. They have been spok- 
en of both good and evil. The Latter- 
day Saints in this day and age of the 
world, are no exception. They are 
spoken evil of by those who possess an 
evil spirit, and they are spoken well of 
by those who are honest in heart. 

Having said this much regarding the 
peculiarities of our people, let us, my 
brethren and sisters, continue to be a 
peculiar people. Let our influence be 
felt wherever we go. Let it be said of 
us that we are indeed a peculiar people, 
in this, that the love of God abounds 
in our hearts, and that we seek to build 
one another up, not to tear down. 
When we come in contact with the 
world let them feel that we have no 
spirit of hatred toward them, no spirit 
to tear them down, but that m the 
depths of our hearts we desire to save 
their souls and to do them good. I 
know that this Gospel is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, the power of God unto 
salvation; that through the instrumen- 
tality of the Prophet Joseph Smith it 
has been restored to earth, never again 
to be taken away and never again to 
be thrown down; that those whom God 
has chosen to stand at the head of His 
people today are inspired of Him and 
possess the spirit of their calling. God 
help all to attain this testimony for 
themselves, and may we uphold and 
sustain His servants with all our 
hearts, is my prayer through Jesus 
Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission). 

My brothers and sisters, there is a 
desire in my breast that our Father 
will bless me with His Spirit the few 
moments I stand before you to testify 
of His goodness unto me, and unto the 
Elders I am privileged to labor with in 
the Northern States mission. Though 
my knees tremble under the task of 
speaking to you, my heart rejoices in 
the privilege of visiting this conference, 
and hearing the testimonies of my 
brethren who have been called upon to 
speak. I rejoice in their testimonies 
because it warms my soul, and makes 
me feel that God has been good to me 
in giving me also a testimony of His 
Gospel, .and testifying to my soul that 
His Son Jesus Christ is the Savior of 
the world. I know that for the past 
six months our Father in heaven has 
fulfilled His promises upon the heads 
of the Elders laboring in the Northern 
States mission, and that they have 
been inspired in the performance of 
their duties. Many of them, during the 
past few months, look as brown as 
though they had been working in the 
harvest fields at home. I rejoice in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and in the pro- 
gress of the work in the mission where 
we are laboring. Our cry to the Pres- 
idency of the Church has been, as I 
understand is the case with presidents 
of other missions, that we have too few 
Elders to answer the calls of the peo- 
ple who desire to hear from us. From 
the northern to the southern part of our 
mission, we have calls from the people 
for tracts and books, and for visits from 
the Elders, so much so that during the 
last six months we have been compelled 
to ask the Saints to stand alone, to look 
to God, to read the Book of Mormon, 
and Doctrine and Covenants, to go to 
their Father in heaven for wisdom, and 
permit the Elders to go out among the 
strangers who have not had the privi- 
lege of hearing the gospel. The efforts 
of the Elders this summer have been 
blessed, and for the past four months, 
we have had an average of about fifty 
baptisms per month; and we have dis- 



tributed 125,000 tracts, half of which 
are pamphlets, consisting of thirty-two 
pages. The Elders have sold hundreds 
of Books of Mormon in the last two 
months. Some of the big book stores 
in our part of the country have kindly 
consented to put our books upon sale 
along with others. We appreciate this 
kindly interest, it is a change ' from 
wha: has been in the past, for hereto- 
fore our books, if they have been in 
stores at all, have had a place among 
the shelfworn and second-hand stock. 

There is one incident that has occur- 
red in the Northern States mission 
which I believe all Latter-day Saints 
will be interested in, that is the con- 
ference that was held in Nauvoo last 
Saturday and Sunday. If I may be per- 
mitted I will relate the circumstances 
under which the conference was held 
there. About one month ago the pres- 
ident of the Northern Illinois confer- 
ence was looking for a suitable place to 
hold a conference, and, having done 
missionary work for the past year in 
Hancock county, and had been blessed 
by a number of baptisms, and having 
heard it remarked that the "Reorgan- 
ized church" people were contemplating 
holding conference in Nauvoo, he decid- 
ed to hold the conference there, if pos- 
sible, for he understood that they had 
postponed their's for one year, because 
conditions were not favorable. When 
he wrote to us about this, we requested 
the Southern Illinois Elders to join the 
northern Elders in holding conference 
there on the 30th of September, and the 
1st of October. In accordance with 
that appointment, forty-eight Elders 
and twenty Saints gathered at Nauvoo 
on the 29th of September. The people 
residing here unitedly opened ftheir 
homes and welcomed what they termed 
the constructionist division of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. They said that, if the 
people of Nauvoo had not driven the 
Latter-day Saints, that beautiful loca- 
tion would now be one of the greatest 
cities in the United States. They re- 
marked that the people who were driven 
out of Nauvoo had gone into a desert 
and had made it a desirable place, and 
they have not imagination enough to 
conceive of what would have been done

in Nauvoo, had the Saints stayed in 
that goodly country. Some of the Saints 
and Elders from the Central States mis- 
sion, hearing- of our conference, visited 
us, as also some from the Southern 
States. The Spirit of the Lord was up- 
on every Elder who bore witness to 
the truthfulness of the gospel, and the 
hearts of the people rejoiced. We had 
more houses offered for our accommo- 
dation than we could occupy. Eight 
Elders had the privilege of rooming in 
President Brigham Young's old home; 
four, I think, in Heber C. Kimball's 
house; and eight or ten in the Nauvoo 
Mansion House. We held our fast 
meeting in the Riverside or Nauvoo 
house. The Spirit of the Lord was up- 
on those who bore witness in that meet- 
ing, and all present were much affected. 
We had the pleasure of having Brother 
Lorin Farr with us, who formerly lived 
in that city, and who filled a mission to 
the Eastern States under the call of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. The Nauvoo 
people Wire anxious to have him visit 
Them and t;.lk of old times. Some said 
they hod been praying for years that 
the Latter-day Saints, the people who 
had made a desert to blossom as the 
rose, would come back, and help them 
build up that city, which is now sixty 
years behind the times. The residents 
in Lii e Nauvoo House moved into that 
place four months ago. They had never 
met any of the elders before, but the 
Spirit of the Lord came upon them, 
and we heard that, the day after con- 
ference, that family, with others, were 
baptized in the Mississippi river. 

I rejoice that the spirit in that coun- 
try, once the home of the Latter-day 
Saints, has changed, and the people 
there deplore the fact that wicked men 
drove out people who were gifted with 
the power to build up a country, and 
w ho had within their souls a desire to 
beautify this earth. The mayor told 
us we would be always welcome. Tru- 
man who owns the hall that faces east 
on the temple block said that we could 
have the use of that hall from this time 
forth. Heretofore we have had to hold 
our meetings on the streets. Our Sun- 
day afternoon and Sunday evening 



meetings were attended by about five 
hundred people, and they expressed 
themselves sorry when the meetings 
closed, for, they said, they had never 
witnessed anything like it since they 
lived in that city. The comment was 
made that, if fifty elders and a few 
saints could make them feel that good, 
what would ten thousand, or twenty 
thousand Latter-day Saints do for 
them? The spirit manifested in Nauvoo 
is also exhibited in other parts of Illi- 
nois, with the exception that a few 
people are still fighting the truth. The 
honest people, the farmers, the working 
people, those who earn their bread by 
industry, seem to desire the truth, and 
though they may be blinded, and feel 
that in fighting the Latter-day Saints 
they are engaged in a good cause, yet 
when they meet our elders and come in 
contact with their influence, they ad- 
mire their devotion and respect the 
sacrifice they make in proclaiming the 
gospel. People of honest purpose can- 
not withstand the influence of the men 
who are out preaching the gospel, 
young men from eighteen to twenty- 
four years of age, who go hungry and 
footsore, who pray by the roadside that 
they may find the honest in heart, who 
stop from time to time and hold meet- 
ings, laboring faithfully until their 
soult; and their bodies are weary. These 
young men, filled with the Spirit of 
God, plead on their knees for' God to 
bless the people; and they call them to 
repentance in a voice that would almost 
soften the heart of a stone. Thess 
young men, after they have notified the 
people of a little town that they are 
going to hold a meeting, and have la- 
bored all day with that end in view, ara 
filled with the Spirit of God when the 
meeting is held, and the people bless 
them, take them home, buy their books, 
and invite them to come again. I know 
of no one better prepared to preach to 
the people, and to plead with them to 
follow Christ, than these young men are 
after a hard day's work of this kind. 
I rejoice in the work they are doing. 
I rejoice in the faithfulness of the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice in the spirit 
of this conference, and in the spirit of 



54

the Saints wherever I go. May God bless 
them; may He help all of us to fulfill 
the calling - whereunto we have been 
called, that we may dedicate our all to 
the service of the Master, that we may 
spread the truth, to the end that all thy 
world may feel as we do, and rejoice 
In the name of the Lord for the Gospel 
that He has restored in our day. And 
though our knees tremble, may our 
hearts rejoice in bearing this witness to 
the inhabitants of the earth, that when 
we come up in the morning of the resur- 
rection our Master may say "Well 
done," and the honest in heart of the 
earth rise up and bless us for our 
labors and for the time we spent in 
bringing them to a knowledge of the 
truth. May the sacrifice and the devo- 
tion of the Latter-day Saints draw to 
them the honest in heart of the earth, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 
(President of Juarez Stake.) 
I desire, my brethren and sisters, to 
preface the brief remarks that I am 
about to make by reading a few para- 
graphs from the Book of Mormon. Six 
hundred years before the birth of our 
Savior, the Lord called His servant 
Lehi to come out from Jerusalem, with 
his family, to a land which the Lord 
promised to lead him to, and to give 
to him and to his descendants after 
him for an everlasting inheritance. He 
outlined to this man in vision the fu- 
ture of his posterity and of the world 
throughout its generations, until a 
time should come in the dispensation of 
the fullness of times when truth should 
triumph over error, and when God's 
kingdom should be established in the 
earth. In order that this vision might 
be made clearer, plainer, and more 
comprehensible, the Lord sent his angel 
to explain and enlarge upon it to Ne- 
phi, the son of Lehi. Among other 
things, he saw that after the descend- 
ants of this man should dwindle in un- 
belief, a great church should be es- 
tablished in the earth, a church which 



he called the mother of abominations., 
a church which should worship gold 
and silver, satin and fine-twined linen; 
and he saw that this church should 
dominate the entire earth. Then he 
saw the establishment of another 
church, which he called the church of 
the Lamb of" God; and it is just a few 
paragraphs relating to this epoch that 
I desire to read— the period of time, my 
brethren and sisters, in which we live, 
and in whose events we are actual par- 
ticipants: 

"And it came to pass that I looked 
and beheld the whore of all the earth, 
and she sat upon many waters: and she 
had dominion over all the earth, among 
the nations, kindreds, tongues, and peo- 
ple. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld 
the church of the Lamb of God, and its 
numbers were few. because of the wick- 
edness and abominations of the whore 
who sat upon many waters: neverthe- 
less, I beheld the church of the lamb, 
who were the saints of God. were also 
upon the face of the earth: and their 
dominions upon the face of the earth 
were small, because of the wickedness 
of the great whore whom I saw." 

Now. my brethren and sisters, the 
thing to which I wish to call your at- 
tention is this: At the time the Book 
of Mormon was published to the world, 
the church of the Lamb of God did not 
exist. It had not come into being in 
its organized form. Now. think back 
for a little more than -seventy-five 
years, and let us ask ourselves whether 
or not the words of the Lord that He 
gave to Nephi more than two thousand 
years ago are not verified. I have al- 
ways rejoiced in the fact that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are a people who live 
in the present. Their faith is not 
founded upon that which is past, al- 
though they delight to understand the 
past, because in contemplating it they 
can in a degree judge of the future. 
They are not a people whose hopes 
are founded altogether upon something 
that is yet future; but they are a peo- 
ple who live in the present. They are 
fulfillers of prophecy. They are a peo- 
ple who are enacting their part in the 
great work of the redemption of the hu- 
man race, outlined by the ancient pro- 
phets of God. What is the condition 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



55 



of the Church today? I have been 
led to contemplate this question, be- 
cause of the report which was made 
here by the President of thd> Church at 
the opening of the conference. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints are firmly established in 
Canada; their possessions extend into 
Oregon; they are in Montana, in Idaho, 
in Wyoming, in California, in Arizona, 
in Colorado, in Utah, in New Mexico. 
They have gone over the wall, and are 
in the republic of Mexico, still further 
south. Not only are their possessions 
to be found in this district of country to 
which I have referred, but you may 
find them also in the States of the Un- 
ion, in the countries of Europe, and 
upon the islands of the sea. The Saints 
of God are acquiring possessions in 
these countries, few it is true, if they 
were not few, it would not be in ac- 
cordance with the written word of God. 

I am very pleased to report to you 
the condition/ of your brethren and sis- 
ters in the Juarez Stake of Zion. They 
are in a foreign country, a country 
which offers very few natural induce- 
ments to men and women who reside 
in the United States, a country with 
very little public land, a country where 
every inch that we have acquired we 
have had to do so by continuous effort. 
Nevertheless, there are, according to 
our statistics, 3,751 Latter-day Saints in 
that land. They are scattered over a 
large area. They are poor people, but 
industrious, God-fearing, and economi- 
cal. They are exceedingly liberal with 
the limited means which the Lord has 
given them. This is illustrated in the 
fact that about 40 of them have come 
up to attend this conference, and I am 
certain that, taking a very conserva- 
tive estimate, these people will have 
spent $5000 in making this trip before 
they return to their homes. These three 
thousand and odd Latter-day Saints 
paid $50,000 in tithing last year, which 
amounts to about $13.50 for every soul 
in the stake, including men, women, and 
children. But a man said to me last 
night, that is Mexican money, is it not? 
Yes, that is Mexican money, and a Mex- 
ican dollar counts with us just as much 
as an American dollar counts to you, 



until we get over the line, and they are 
cut in two, and call it fifty cents; but 
the Mexican laboring man receives no 
more for his work, the teamster or the 
freighter receives no more for his work 
in Mexico than he does in the 
United States, and at the same time 
we pay about three times as much for 
everything we consume as you do here. 
I said this to a broker who was down 
there once, and he said he didn't believe 
it. I simply called attention to the 
fact that the sugar we use to sweeten 
our food and preserve our fruits costs 
us from $15 to $17 a sack, against five 
or six dollars you pay here; the fruit 
jars we put our fruit in cost us thirty- 
five cents a quart jar,as against eight or 
ten cents you pay here; the salt we put 
in our food costs us five or six cents a 
pound, I suppose you get it for about 
half a cent; the flour we eat costs us 
from six to nine dollare per hundred 
as against about two and a half dollars 
you pay here. So I could go on indefin- 
itely, and am certain that the average 
of prices we pay for that which we con- 
sume in Mexico is three times as much 
as it is in the United States. Not- 
withstanding these conditions, my 
brethren and sisters, we are building 
up thrifty and prosperous settlements. 
The very best rural towns of their 
age and size that I have ever seen are 
in Mexico. You will see there more 
good brick houses that would be credi- 
table to any community, than in any 
other towns of their age or 
size I have ever visited. "We 
are in a country where men 
can work three hundred and sixty-five 
days in the year. We are never idle. 
Men wear out their lives with hard la- 
bor. 

The Mexican mission and those who 
have been converted to the Gospel 
among the rative population are not 
included in the enumeration to which 
I have referred. There are several 
hundred people who are converts to the 
Church in and around the city of Mexico. 
They are Indians. There are about eight 
millions of pure blooded Indians in the 
republic of Mexico, and probably two 
millions of other people in whom the 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Indian blood largely predominates, 
while there are two or three millions of 
people who are foreigners. Wherever 
ive have gone among this pure blooded 
people with the Gospel, they have been 
ready to receive it. Our greatest effort 
is to keep them out until the time 
comes when we feel prepared to take 
•care of them. They are a good people, 
•devoted and God-fearing, that is, those 
"who have embraced the truth. While 
their skins are dark, they are a think, 
ing people, and understand the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, and are capable of 
discussing them with any people that 
I have ever ccme in contact with. They 
are people of the covenant. 

The very fact that these Indians are 
beginning to receive the truth 
is of great importance to us. 
Have you ever stopped to con- 
template, have you ever reflected 
•upon the fact that Christ himself said 
to their fathers: 

"Verily, I say unto you, I give unto 
you a sign, that ye mav known the time 
when these things shall be about to 
take place [referring to the fulfillment 
of the promises made to the seed of 
that people and to the restoration of 
the Jews]: * * * and behold this is 
the thing which I will give unto you 
for a sign: 

'"For verily I say unto you, that when 
these things which I declare unto you, 
and which I shall declare unto you 
hereafter of myself, and by the power 
of the Holy Ghost, shall be made 
known unto the Gentiles, that they 
may know concerning this people who 
are a remnant of the house of Jacob, 
and concerning this my people who 
shall be scattered by them: 

"Verily, verily. I say unto you, when 
these things shall be made known unto 
them of the Father, and shall come of 
the Father, from them unto you; 

* * • 

"When these works, and the works 
which shall be wrought among you 
hereafte' 1 , shall come forth from the 
Gentiles unto your seed, which shall 
dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity; 

* * * 

"And when these things come to 
pass, that thy seed shall begin to know 
these things, it shall be a sign unto 
them, that thev may know that the 
work of the Father hath already com- 
menced unto the fulfilling of the coven- 
ant which he hath made unto the peo- 
ple who are of the house of Israel." 

That time has come, my brethren and 



sisters. The works of the Church are 
translated into the Spanish language. 
These millions of people who are south 
of us, and who are direct descendants 
of father Lehi, heirs of the promises 
made to him and to his descendants, 
are beginning to come to a knowledge 
of the truth of the Gospel. It seems to 
me that a great responsibility rests 
upon us regarding them. We are in- 
debted to them for the Book of Mor- 
mon, which contains the fullness of 
the everlasting Gospel, and which is 
the greatest living prophecy that 
stands before the world today. We are 
tcld that if a man prophecy and the 
things which he declares come to pass, 
we may know by that that he is a 
prophet; and I say that if the Book 
of Mormon stood alone as an evidence 
of the divine authenticity of the mis- 
sion of the Prophet Joseph Smith, it 
is sufficient to establish the fact that 
he was called of God. It has unlocked 
the door by which we are able to read 
the past. It declares to us the present, 
and it forecasts to us the future, by 
which we know that the triumph of the 
work of the Lord is sure. It stands, as 
brother Roberts has said, as a new 
witness for God before the nations of 
the earth. The fact burned into my 
soul in my youth that not one word 
of prophecy which is contained in this 
book will fall to the ground unfulfilled. 
If this is the case, we know that the 
destiny of this Church is very closely 
::llied with the destiny of these dark- 
skinned people south of us. We cannot 
avoid the responsibility. We must 
carry the Gospel to them. They must 
be redeemed, they must come into the 
fold of Christ, they must be numbered 
with those who are already members 
of His Church before the redemption 
of Zion comes, and before the center 
stake of Zion shall be built up. Read 
the prophecies for yourselves, and 
judge whether or not I am, correct in 
making this assertion. 

My brethren and sisters, we in Mexi- 
co are laboring, as you are, in humility 
and in faith for the establishment of 
God's kingdom in the earth. We be- 
lieve that it will be established, that 



ELDER JOSEPH 

His purposes will be accomplished, and 
that despite the efforts of men or devils 
to stay the progress of this work, it 
will triumph, and Christ will come 
and reign in power and dominion with 
His Saints upon the earth. May the 
Lord help us to keep the covenants 
that we have entered into, to be true 
to each other, to be true to the Lord, 
increase our faith, our hone, our char- 
ity, our good works, and by so doing 
others may be led to glorify the name 
of our Father in heaven, and be 
brought into His fold. God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 
(President of California Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, my heart is 
lifted up in praise and thanksgiving 
when I hear the testimony of my breth- 
ren in relation to the growth and ad- 
vance that the Church of Christ is 
making in -the earth. With Balaam of 
old, I feel to say. "How goodly are thy 
tents. O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O 
Israel! As the valleys are they spread 
forth, as gardens by the river's side, 
as the trees of lignaloes which the 
I«ord hath planted, and as cedar trees 
beside the waters. Blessed is he that 
olesseth thee, and cursed is he that 
curseth thee." 

The mission that I have the honor 
of representing is not so large as some 
other missions in the United States; 
but I believe it has as varied interests 
as any of them. Varied as is the state 
of California in its flora and fauna, so 
is it socially and religiously. Mt. Shasta 
at the north end of the state is nea>rly 
three miles above the sea. It is crown- 
ed with glaciers of everlasting ice. The 
only plant life near the snow line is fhe 
lichen and the moss. Then we have 
in the Imperial valley, at the south 
end of the state. 300 feet below sea 
level, the palms and oranges and dates 
of the warmer countries. Just as 
varied as is the growth of vegetation, 
and the character of animal life be- 
tween these two extremes of altitude, 
are the religious beliefs of that people. 
Someone has said that there are 1,440 



E. ROBINSON. 57 

odd "somebodies" in the United States 
and 80,000,000 of "nobodies," and that 
California has one-third or more of 
these "somebodies." Though I have 
been there a few years, I have not come 
to know much about the "somebodies;" 
but I have learned that the "some- 
bodies" and "nobodies" that are there 
have a great many different ideas of 
religion. During the last summer it 
was my privilege to attend some lec- 
tures that were delivered before the 
Venice Assembly — a society resort near 
Los Angeles. I came away from those 
gatherings with a fixed and firm de- 
termination to preach Christ and Him 
ciucifled whenever opportunity offered; 
for I found there that the men who 
stood up as social reformers, as ec- 
clesiastical leaders, as philosophers of 
all the ologies and isms of the day, 
seem to have lost sight of the fact that 
Jesus is the very Son of God. Many 
of them mouthed the same sentiment as 
Lyman Abbot had expressed, wherein 
he said, "My God is an ever-present 
energy, manifesting itself in all the 
activities of human life and in all the 
workings of nature. I believe," said 
he, "in a God that is in all things, and 
through all things, and of all things" — 
pantheistic wholly in its nature. I 
heard one of the most eminent clergy- 
men offer a prayer just before the 
great Baba Bhareta delivered his ad- 
dress upon the mission of the old 
world to the new — the mission of the 
Buddhists of the eastern world to the 
Christians of the western world; and 
in his prayer he said something like 
this: "O Thou Great and Infinite One, 
from whom we emanate, and from 
whence all things come, who is of all 
things and through all things and by 
all things, let Thy Spirit rest down 
upon these Thy children this day, that 
whether the message be from Moses 
or Job, of Christ or of Bhudda, or of 
Krishna, that all shall know that it 
emanates from Thee, the Fount of Love 
alone." I heard some of them say, in 
speaking of the Master, that although 
He was one of the greatest leaders, 
ethically and morally, that the world 
has ever produced, fhat He was en- 



58 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



dewed with miraculous gifts, that He 
was the greatest Prophet the world has, 
ever known, yet they could not regard 
him as the Son of God as do orthodox 
Christians. Two weeks ago today, in 
Los Angeles, one of our little Sunday 
school hoys, a non-"Mormon," asked 
why they did not make a picture of 
God. He said, "I have seen pictures of 
angels and pictures of Jesus Christ, but 
why don't they make a picture of 
God?" It brought to my mind the ad- 
dresses I had heard in the Venice as- 
sembly. It was brought to my mind 
again yesterday, by the editorial in the 
Deseret News in relation to what 
Joseph Hamilton had said at Wilson, 
New York, to the effect that God is a 
Spirit, and at the same time he tried 
hard to make it out that He is a per- 
sonal being as well, stating that He 
could at His pleasure assume a per- 
sonal form. 

In California. Christian Science has a 
great following. In fact, the religious 
atmosphere of that great state is ab- 
normal. Those who are religious seem 
to be abnormally so. They have built 
up an ethereal sphere, through pervert- 
ed imagination or fancy, that is 
wholly untenable to the matter-of-fact 
man. Christian Science, friends and 
followers in that State have fructified 
to that extent that there are many 
branches of Home Love, of Faith Heal- 
ing, and of Faith Cure; and it is their 
hope, so I have been told by some of 
their leaders, that it will not be long be- 
fore th_ey shall live and never taste of 
death, through their knowledge of 
Christian Science. But these people 
deny Jesus as the Christ, the Son of 
God. 

It is a fruitful land also for Spiritual- 
ism. Many men and women there 
study what they call the occult sci- 
ences. They have gathered from all 
over the world This class of people, 
too, deny that Jesus is the Son of God. 

We have there also headcuarters of 
theosophy, with a temple of Isis, estab- 
lished for the very purpose of resur- 
recting the old theosophy of Egypt. 
They, too, deny that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Son of God. 

Then there is the Unitarian church, 



which has a large following. In fact, 
this assembly that I have been speaking 
of was conducted and presided over by 
a Unitarian, although he and his fol- 
lowers do not call themselves Unitari- 
ans, but they are nevertheless. They 
believe in one God — Love — an essence, a 
force; and they accept Jesus Christ, 
not as the Son of God, but as the ex- 
pression of Love in human form. 

This has made it difficult for us to 
proselyte after the manner of the Apos- 
tles of old, and to use the Scriptures; 
for they have to be converted first of 
all to the thought that the Bible may 
be the word of God, before they will 
listen to the scriptural passages we 
can quote to prove the divinity of 
Jesus. 

In addition to those I have mentioned, 
there are many who are called Inde- 
pendent Christians. They claim, with 
the late Secretary John Hay, that they 
cannot find within the narrow creed of 
any of the orthodox churches a pure 
and full expression of their ideas of 
religion. Among this class of people 
we have greater freedom and are able 
to do the most good, because their 
minds are healthy, and they have not 
the vain imaginations that others have. 
They listen to our testimonies, encour- 
age us, and give us the hand of fel- 
lowship. In some of their organiza- 
tions we are privileged to speak, and In 
others we do the praying, while in oth- 
ers we have done the singing, and con- 
ducted burial services over their dead, 
because they do not attend to these 
things themselves; their organizations 
are merely for the cultivation of so- 
cial virtues, and for beneficent pur- 
poses. 

Not a great while ago (I believe I 
mentioned it here once, but it will not 
hurt to tell it again), a Catholic priest 
came to me, and after he was assured 
that I was the representative of om 
people— for he had expected to see 
someone with a long, white beard, ven- 
erable and dignified in appearance— he 
disclosed to me his identity as a Cath- 
olic priest, and told me that he had 
come to the conclusion that no man 
could live a correct life in celibacy. He 
had heard of the wondrous growth and 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



59 



progress of our people, their institu- 
tions, and their social economy, and he 
desired to cast his lot with us, that he 
might have a home and a family of his 
own. "But," said he, "there is one 
crucial point I want to be satisfied upon 
before I can accept your Gospel— do you 
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Soi» 
of God?" When I answered, "Verily 
we do," he remarked, "Well, I expect 
we are all in a measure the sons and 
daughters of God, but do you believe 
that He is any different from the rest 
of us, because I cannot think that he 
Is more than the natural son of Joseph 
or some other man." 

To my mind, it is just such doc~ 
trines as those put forth by Jos&ph 
Hamilton and Lyman Abbott that ar^ 
responsible for much of the infidelity 
in the world today and of the indiffer- 
ence towards religion. Men feel, so 
they express it, that they can see as 
far into the future as any other man. 
They do not care, they say, for a re- 
ligion that deals with the dead past 
alone, and that has dead forms; they 
want something that is alive, that is 
tangible, that appeals to their material 
minds as well as to their emotions, and 
that can offer them something to do- 
something that is reasonable and tangi- 
ble. 

Such are the questions that we are 
confronted with in that land. There- 
fore, we have to learn something be- 
sides the Scripture, and be enabled tc 
bring forth strong reasons upon these 
matters before we can satisfy them 
that we have a religion that is better 
than other churches of the land have 
—something that within the very geni- 
us of it answers the demands of men'o 
souls, that is soul-uplifting, and that 
brings to men the benediction that al- 
ways accompanies the truth. 

I note that Mr. Hamilton speaks of 
the fact that God created man in Hi* 
own image, male and female; that Ht, 
spoke to Adam in the Garden of Eden, 
that He reported to the council in 
heaven that Adam and Eve had be- 
come like unto them, knowing good 
from evil; that afterwards He visited 
Abram; that He ate and drank with 



him on the plains of Mamre, and, after 
the custom of the country, had his feet 
bathed; that He told Abram that He 
had come down to see if the reports in 
relation to Sodom and Gomorrah were 
correct; that afterwards He wrestled 
with Jacob, and that Jacob constrained 
Him, in fact, would not let Him go 
until He had blessed him; that He 
changed the name of Jacob at that tim& 
to Israel, because, He said, you have 
prevailed with the Lord, and Jacob re- 
joiced, because, said he, I have seen 
the Lord face to face and still live. He 
quotes the fact, too, that God spoke, 
to Moses face to face, as one man 
speaketh to another, and not in vision 
nor in dark sentences; that God re- 
buked Miriam and Aaron for their 
jealousy and reminded them that He 
spoke- to Moses as one man speaks to- 
another, mouth to mouth. He cites 
the fact also that Stephen beheld the 
Christ, after the resurrection, sitting 
upon the right hand of the Father, 
clothed with the glory that He had 
prayed for before the dread night of 
Gethsemane. when He asked that the 
Father should restore unto Him all the 
glory that He had with Him before the 
world was; the fact, too, that Jesus, 
the Christ, was born of woman, as we 
are, and that He grew up as a child, 
like other children. If we credit the 
writings of the early fathers, we learn 
that He used to fashion animals, birds, 
etc., of clay; that in His father's work- 
shop He learned to fashion the yoke 
for the cattle, and make tools, and' 
build after the manner of that day. Wc 
learn that afterwards, when John had 
become converted because of the Holy 
Ghost descending upon Him in the sign 
of a dove, the same bore witness to His 
Apostles that He was the Lamb of 
God, who taketh away the sins of the 
world; yet this same Jesus suffered 
hunger and thirst, and the adversary 
strove to tempt Him and lead Him 
astray from the path of righteousness 
because of His hunger, fatigue and 
thirst. 

We understand that He went to Naz- 
areth, the home of His youth, and took 
up the Scriptures as was His wont up-

on the Sabbath day to teach them. Clad 
w ith newer and greater authority, hav- 
ing come into the fulness of manhood 
and privileged, under the law, to take 
up the ministry, He taught as one hav- 
ing authority, and they resented it and 
cast Him out, saying, "Is He not Jos- 
eph the carpenter's son, and have we 
not His brothers and sisters with us 
till this very day?" How sad the words 
of the Master as He turns from them— 
"a prophet is not without honor, save 
in his own country and among his own 
people." They know how He was mock- 
ed by the Pharisees and the Sadducees, 
when, fatigued and ill with privation 
and with the wondrous labors he per- 
formed, they cried unto him. Physician, 
heal thyself. They watch Him through 
His course of life. They can read of 
it as do we. How He wept over the 
death of Lazarus; how He seemed as 
a man among men, aside from His mi- 
raculous powers of healing and divina- 
tion. At the same time He promised 
that those who believed on Him should 
do the works which He did, and greater 
works, and that the same signs should 
follow the true believer unto the end 
of the world. We know, too, that the 
early Apostles did raise the dead to 
life, performed miracles, cast out evil 
spirits, opened the eyes of the blind, 
unstopped the ears of the deaf, and 
caused the lame to leap like the hart. 
They read of the Master as He went 
to Golgotha, breaking down like a weak 
man under the heavy cross. They read 
how He died as a man dies. Notwith- 
standing all these things they feel that 
He was no more than man. They 
lose sight of the fact that He was a 
perfect man, enjoying the full capabili- 
ties of man; and that because of His 
parentage He had more than manhood, 
that He had power inherent within 
Himself to break the bands of death 
and take his body up again. It is afTer 
the resurrection that we note the 
greatest difference. He appears before 
His disciples in the self-same body, 
showing the prints of the nails in His 
hands and feet, and the mark of the 
spear-thrust in His side, and asks the 
doubting one to come and test Him, for 



a spirit had not flesh and bones as He 
had. We see Him then partaking of 
food with His disciples and laboring 
with them for 40 days. We then read 
of His ascension into heaven in the 
same bodily form that He had while 
sojourning among the children of men; 
and angels testified to those sons of 
Galilee that as He ascended into heav- 
en, in the same manner He should also 
descend. John says, "Beloved, when 
He comes we shall be like Him, and 
we shall see Him as He is" — not as the 
vain imaginations of men would make 
Him, but as the express image of His 
Father's person, in the likeness of His 
Father. 

It seems to me that if men would 
study these things as they are written, 
and not spiritualize them, they could 
not help but admit the fact that we 
are in the image of our Father; that 
as He is the father of our spirits He is 
also the Father of Jesus, the Christ. 
And more, that He was the Father of 
Jesus, the Christ, in the flesh, the only 
begotten in the flesh. And so I repeat. 
I have felt constrained to preach more 
strenuously "Jesus Christ and Him cru- 
cified," and the personality of our 
Father, and the fact that we are indeed 
His children, and that we are com- 
manded to become perfect like Him, 
and we may become like Him if we 
follow in the way which the Master 
hath marked out. I believe that the 
greatest revelation given in these the 
last days was the vision of Joseph the 
Prophet when he saw God the Father 
and the Son, and made statement of the 
fact that man is in the image of Deity. 
This revelation abolishes icomplietejly 
the theory of the men I have quoted, 
and annuls the Athanasian creed, which 
obtains in the Roman Catholic and 
Episcopal faiths, and is printed in their 
creeds even unto this day. I believe 
if men would study more of Jesus, the 
Christ, they would come near to know- 
ing who our Father is and what He is 
like. Then they might accept Jesus 
as the Only Begotten of the Father, 
and turn to Him, and love and follow 
Him, and rejoice in the prerogatives of 
the everlasting gospel.

This is why we are striving to preach 
to the people the divinity of Jesus, be- 
cause of their disbelief in the Son of 
God. I pray, my brethren and sisters, 
that in our lives we shall emulate the 
example of. the Lord Jesus Christ; for 
then we may become joint heirs with 
Him to the power and the prerogatives 
of our Father. When men have been 
told these things, it has uplifted their 
hearts, and their minds have been ex- 
alted with the concept that the Latter- 
day Saints have of Jesus, the Christ. 
Many men have told me that they have 
had a new incentive to live aright, a 
deeper hope and a deeper faith had 
been implanted in their hearts because 
of the testimony of the Elders in rela- 
tion to the personality of God the Fath- 
er, and that Jesus is indeed His Son. 

God bless you, my brothers and sis- 
ters. Pray for us in the mission field, 
as we pray for you. We have the right 
to expect a great deal of you, that as 
we are looked upon as representatives 
of our people, that you at home shall 
do your part well; that all we say in 
our pride and love for you shall be 
maintained and upheld: that you will 
prove you are the people of God, that 
our mission in the world is the uplift- 
ing of humanity, and that in the due 
time of the Lord we shall succeed in 
it; which God grant, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus, the Christ. Amen. 

The anthem "How beautiful upon the 
mountains" was sung by the choir, and 
the solo parts were rendered by Sister 
Lizzie T. Edward and Elder John Rob- 
inson. 

Benediction by Elder Charles F. Mid- 
dleton. 

The Tabernacle was excessively 
crowded, and. soon after the morning 
meeting commenced, it was announced 
that an overflow meeting would be held 
in the Assembly hall. 



OVERFLOW flEETING. 

An overflow session was held in the 
Assembly hall, commencing at 10:30 
a. m. The presiding officer was Elder 
Rudger Clawson. and Prof. Charles J. 
Thomas conducted the singing, assist- 
ed by the Temple choir. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn : 



Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam ; 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

ELDER BENJAMIN F. GODDARD. 

My brethren and sisters, I esteem it 
a privilege to meet with you in gen- 
eral conference and participate in the 
spirit that prevails amongst us. It 
is indeed gratifying to thus meet to- 
gether, that we may renew our ac- 
quaintance with friends residing in 
different parts of our state and the sur- 
rounding states, and that we may also, 
listen to the instructions given unto us 
by our beloved leaders, and indicate 
unto them in general conference that 
we sustain them with our faith and 
prayers, with uplifted hands before 
God. I realize that our brethren, who 
are with us today, need the support 
and strength that can be given unto 
them by the united faith and prayers 
and manifestations of good-will from 
the Saints assembled in general con- 
ference. I rejoice in thus meeting to- 
gether, but presume probably, that it 
may be more interesting ,to refer par- 
ticularly to the work that I am most 
closely associated with, upon the Tem- 
ple block. We instituted, in 1902, the 
Bureau of Information. As probably- 
very few of the Saints realize the 
method of our work, or what is being 
accomplished in this part of the Lord's 
vineyard, I will say that during the 
past year we have entertained upon the 
Temple block the strangers that have 
come from various parts of the world, 
numbering over 175,000; and we have 
had ample opportunities of distributing 
to them our literature, explaining our 
work, the organization of the Church 
and the labors we are performing for 
the salvation of the children of men. 
Probably in no part of the world have 
we an opportunity of portraying so for- 
cibly some of these principles as we 
have here upon this block, for, as we 
pass round with our stranger friends, 
and visit these buildings, and explain 
to them some of the distinctive features 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thereof, there is scarcely one moment 
without an opportunity of introducing- 
something pertaining to our history or 
the principles of the Gospel. If we 
come into the Assembly Hall and ex- 
plain to them why this building was 
erected, and its seating capacity, many 
of them at once observe a difference 
between our seating arrangement and 
that which is usually found in modern 
churches. "And, why is this?" Of 
course, the explanation is promptly 
given, that our seats are all alike for 
rich and poor, for strangers as well 
as our own members, that seats are 
free, that there are no collections made, 
no donations received. And what does 
it lead to, think you? "Why, the ques- 
tion at once being asked, "How, then 
do you support your Church?" Im- 
mediately we have an opportunity to 
explain the tithing system of the 
Church, which contrasts so favorably 
with the financial systems that pre- 
vail generally in the world. Aston- 
ishment is often expressed, and por- 
trayed upon the countenances of our 
visitors, when they learn how freely 
and cheerfully our brethren and sisters 
pay their tithing, in order that we may 
not only erect places of worship, and 
Temples for the salvation of the dead, 
but that we may be able to sustain the 
poor and help our brethren in times of 
distress. As we continue our conver- 
sation, sometimes that painting over 
the organ here attracts their attention, 
and they wonder if it is not some mys- 
terious symbol associated with 
those rites that they have heard so 
much of in connection with th& "Mor- 
mon" Church. And what does it lead 
to? The fact that when our pioneer 
fathers came here they gave to this re- 
gion, that was then a desert, the name 
of Deseret. "Ah! what means it?" Not 
desert, as they sometimes imagine, but 
that it is a Book of Mormon term, 
meaning the honey-bee; and hence we 
attract attention to the industrious 
features of the "Mormon" people, and 
how they have been asked to emulate the 
bee, the bee-hive being adopted as our 
territorial, and since, as our state, em- 
blem. By their industry they have de- 



veloped the resources of this state; and 
by so doing have made Utah 
admired far and wide because of the 
industrious character of its people. 
"Ah! but there is something else there," 
they say; "what means that all-seeing 
eye?" And then comes the explanation 
that when we were driven out of the 
East, to the abode of the Indian, to this 
desert region, that we recognized that 
God's eye had been upon us and that 
Ho had preserved and favored our fa- 
thers and mothers, that His watchful 
care had been over them, and that He 
had blessed and guided them; that 
President Young, inspired of Him, had 
been able to lead the people into the 
land that God had chosen for their 
dwelling place in these mountain val- 
leys. And thus, as yau will observe, 
while we pass through the block we 
have ample opportunities for introduc- 
ing not only points connected with the 
character of the people, but some of 
the principles of the Gospel and the his- 
tory of the Church. If we pass into 
the Tabernacle, again our visitors are 
astonished at the demonstrations that 
are made there. When our dear friend, 
brother Thomas comes up and drops 
the pin on the stand rail, that they may 
hear it at the extreme end of the gal- 
lery, they are astonished at the mar- 
velous acoustic properties of the build- 
ing. This leads to a statement of the 
fact that the Tabernacle was designed 
and erected under the direction of 
President Brigham Young, whom we 
recognize as a Prophet of God. As we 
view also the arrangement of our 
stands, the question often is asked, 
"What means these three pulpits? Why 
not have one pulpit, as we have in our 
churches?" This leads to an explana- 
tion of the organization of the Church, 
the Melchisedek Priesthood and the 
Aaronic Priesthood, how they operate, 
why they are thus given unto us, and 
the special workings of the various of- 
ficers of the Melchisedek Priesthood, the 
High Priests, Seventies, Elders, and 
the officers of the Aaronic Priesthood, 
the work that each has to perform in 
connection with the Saints of God, thus 
giving ample opportunity for explaining 



ELDER BENJAMIN F. GODDARD. 



63 



the various callings of the Priesthood 
and showing- how perfect the organiza- 
tion of the church of God is, as reveal- 
ed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. And 
then, as we come beneath the shadow 
of our beautiful Temple, and we are 
asked the meaning of that figure upon 
the center tower at the east end of the 
Temple, cannot my brethren and sisters 
comprehend how glad we are to explain 
to our visiting frinds that Moroni has 
come to the earth, bringing the ever- 
lasting Gospel, revealing unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the hiding place 
of the records from which we have re- 
ceived the Book of Mormon. How by 
the information contained in that rec- 
ord, we are able to teach the fulness 
of the Gospel; and how the Lord has 
revealed Himself in our day, the Father 
and the Son having appeared unto the 
Prophet. The Angel Moroni also hav- 
ing appeared unto the Prophet, the 
prophecy of John the Revelator has 
thus been verified, that "I saw another 
angel fly in the midst of heaven, hav- 
ing the everlasting gospel to preach to 
them that dwell on the earth," and so 
on; this prophecy having been literally 
fulfilled in our day. 

I do not know how closely my breth- 
ren and sisters, who come from a dis- 
tance, examine that beautiful structure. 
As I gaze upon it day after day and 
month after month I learn new lessons. 
I am grateful unto God for the reve- 
lations of His will given unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

Scarcely a month passes without some 
new thought developing in connection 
therewith. The three east towers rep- 
resenting the Melchisedek Prisethood, 
or the presiding officers thereof, the 
three west towers representing the 
Aaronic Priesthood. And there are oth- 
er symbols. There is scarcely a day 
passes but we come to the west end of 
the Temple and many of our friends, 
perceiving there those seven stars, the 
Dipper, as they call it, Ursa Major, ask 
"What meaneth it? Why do you have 
them upon that tower facing west- 
ward?" We simply explain to them, as 
that constellation in the heavens is al- 
ways pointing unto the north star, so 



this Temple points unto God, and indi- 
cates to the Saints that therein 
they may learn more perfectly how to 
walk in the way of the Lord, and how 
to gain an exaltation in His presence. 
And then, "why do you have so many 
stars over the windows? Why a star 
over every window? Why that symbol 
of the sun over the upper stories? Why 
those symbols of the moon, a half- 
moon, a full moon, a quarter moon?" 
And what does it lead to, think you? 
To a description of the Temple more 
fully. Those are signs indicating our 
abode .here and how we have come to 
fill our probation upon this earth and 
perfect ourselves that we may regain 
an exaltation in the presence of our 
God, "And how?" by obeying the laws 
that God has revealed. And then comes 
the thought that in the great future we 
are aspiring unto glories that God has 
prepared for the faithful. And we thus 
teach, that, as "there is a glory of the 
sun, a glory of the moon, a glory of 
the stars, and as one star differeth from 
another in glory, so also is the resur- 
rection of the dead." And thus we go 
on, and we have ample opportunity of 
showing how God has revealed His 
mind and will, until we lead up to that 
grandest of all themes, the salvation of 
the dead; the redemption of those who 
have passed away, and how, in that 
great Temple, as well as in others, we 
are able to officiate for our ancestry by 
being baptized for them, believing that 
in the spirit world the Gospel also is 
preached unto them that are dead that 
they might be judged according to men 
in the flesh. As we have our experiences 
increased, day by day, we are able to 
lift up our hearts to God in thankful- 
ness that He has given unto us.through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, these heav- 
enly principles; and we are prouder 
than ever of the Church to which we 
belong, and of the brethren who are 
called to lead and guide us as a peo- 
ple. 

I thank God that He has given unto 
me a testimony of this work, that I 
verily know that God has restored the 
Gospel to the earth; that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was inspired of Him and 
that through him we have not only re-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



ceived the Church itself with all its gifts 
powers and blessings and revelations 
for the guidance thereof, but we have 
received living testimonies in our 
hearts, and we know that all the gifts, 
powers and blessings pertaining to the 
Gospel of Christ are with us today, for 
the power of God is made manifest in 
our families. Our children are growing 
up to realize that God is with us as a 
people, that He sanctifies the minis- 
trations of the Elders and that the 
power of God is amongst this people. 

I pray that God will bless us, that 
He will enable us to withstand the 
weaknesses of the flesh, the tempta- 
tions that assail us, that we may prove 
valiant for the truth; and that we may 
assist to the utmost of our ability in 
building up the Church of God and sus- 
tain by our faith and prayers, by our 
lives, by our words, by our works, those 
who are called to lead and guide us in 
this age; and may God bless us con- 
tinually. Unto this end I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH A. M'RAE, 
(President of Colorado Mission.) 
I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
with you this morning in the oppor- 
tunity we have of meeting together 
under such favorable circumstances. 
I recall a conversation I had in the 
Bureau of Information, some few 
months ago, with a gentleman who 
claimed that this Church was on the 
decline, that it was not growing. I 
thought of this man as I came into 
this building, after having left the 
Tabernacle yonder and seen the thou- 
snds of people who are gathered there 
to hear the voices of the servants of 
the Lord, and I thought if that man 
could have been there, and then come 
over to this building, and then could 
have realized that this is only a small 
representation of our great Church, 
probably he would change his mind. 
I know that the Church is growing; 
that it is increasing, and spreading 
abroad, and it is having influence 
among the peoples of the world. My 
missionary work has called me in a 
little different line from that of the. 



former speaker. Brother Goddard has 
been telling us of the work that is be- 
ing accomplished among strangers 
visiting the Temple block, while the 
work which I have to perform is in 
the mission field abroad, in the states 
lying adjacent to this state. The de- 
mands for more Elders cannot be sup- 
plied. We need many more men in the 
mission field, energetic men, efficient 
men. men of experience. I feel that 
those who have been on missions before 
should prepare themselves for other 
missions in the near future, for there 
is a great work to be accomplished be- 
fore the end comes. It seems to me, 
when 1 view the signs of the times and 
read the reports in the newspapers, 
that the time is near at hand when 
mission work must be hastened, be- 
cause the time for the Gospel to be 
preached unto all people is drawing 
near to a close; therefore the number of 
workers must l;e greatly increased. I 
have been almost on the point of writ- 
ing to the Presidency to ascertain how 
long we are going to continue work in 
the Colorado mission, for the Elders 
are returning home, and new ones are 
not being sent to fill vacancies in the 
mission field. I remember a remark 
made in a little editorial article in one 
of the magazines Brother Rich pub- 
lishes in the south, and I thought it 
was very appropriate. He said in that: 
"We had three Elders come this 
month," and then followed by quoting: 
"Only three grains of corn, mother, 
only three grains of corn, to keep the 
little life I have till the coming of the 
morn." I thought this truly appropri- 
ate to the present condition of mission 
work. There are requests being sent 
to us from various parts of the mis- 
sion today, solicating us to send Elders 
to the people who make these requests 
to explain to them the Gqspel, and we 
cannot comply; we simply do not have 
them to send. 

I have been greatly pleased by the 
work that has been accomplished by 
cur young ladies sent into the mission 
field. They have been able to enter 
the homes of people that the Elders 
could not gain access to. They have 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 



65 



been able to accomplish much in ex- 
plaining' the Gospel unto the people, 
and in teaching the women and child- 
ren, where the Elders could not get 
a hearing. Therefore I feel that they 
have done a great and good work, and 
the end is not yet; in fact it has 
only begun. They go into, the world 
and teach the people the religion of the 
Saints, from the womens' standpoint; 
and they tell the people of the world 
"how the women of Utah live, and how 
they feel, and the people seem to ap- 
preciate it better because women teach 
it to them. We have heard it stated, 
"we like to hear what the women have 
to say about the 'Mormon' question." 
Our sisters have manifested that they 
can go into the world and preach the 
Gospel, and show that the women here 
are not bound and down-trodden, as 
the world think and represent them 
to be. 

This work is growing and increasing. 
It seems that my mind is centered up- 
on that fact, for it is being made evi- 
dent more and more in the field and at 
home. Again I say, we need more 
men of experience to proclaim the Gos- 
pel of peace unto the people. I often 
think that I would like to take a trip 
through various parts of Zion, and se- 
lect a few men and induce the Presi- 
dency of the Church to call them into 
the field. At present I am in the office 
myself, doing the necessary bookkeep- 
ing work of the office, for the reason 
that we can not spare an efficient man 
to perform that labor, as all are needed 
in the mission field. So, we are handi- 
capped in performing the duties devolv- 
ing upon us in the missionary field. 
Brother Goddard has been telling us of 
the oportunjties and enjoyment they 
have in the performance of their duties 
on the Temple block. A few months ago 
I spent a few hours in the building over 
there, the Bureau of Information, and 
I don't think that I ever spent a few 
hours more profitably than I did on 
that occasion, explaining the Gospel to 
the people; I did not act as a guide 
but entertained the people who came in 
there until the guides who could take 
them out arrived. I enjoyed the ex- 
5 



perience very much. I believe Brother 
Goddard would be thankful if he could 
have a few more who are able and 
competent to entertain the people come 
and labor in explaining the Gospel to 
those who visit them and wish to have 
"Mormonism" explained. They come 
here sometimes for the purpose of find- 
ing fault, and scoffing at the Latter- 
day Saints, and these guides explain the 
Gospel unto them, and many go away 
pleased and benefitted. We have been 
performing a somewhat similar labor in 
Manitou, Colorado. There we have met 
thousands of people in the summer re- 
sorts, and we have done the best we 
could to enlighten them in regard to 
our principles. During the past summer 
we have distributed twenty to twenty- 
five thousand pamphlets that teach the 
articles of our faith, explain the organ- 
zation of the Church, and give some 
idea of what we are doing. Although 
it has proved to be a financial burden, 
yet I think it has been a success in pre- 
senting the Gospel to many people. I 
believe that many who have heard the 
Elders there during the last year will 
ask for more information. The pam- 
phets and books that have gone out 
from Manitou this year will increase in- 
terest, and people will come to learn 
further of us concerning our doctrines. 

A gentleman came into my house last 
Thursday; we have been acquainted 
with him a long time. He has opposed 
us, but he has done it in a gentle man- 
ner, and from a Bible standpoint. He 
is a Bible student, and I have thought 
he has been a minister, he is so well 
cersed in the Scripture. He has re- 
cently been reading the life of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and he said to 
me. "I never thought that your people 
were so ill-treated as they have been. 
I did not think we lived in a nation 
that would treat anybody as your peo- 
ple have been treated. Why, to read of 
the way they have been driven, mobbed 
and persecuted, makes my blood boil to 
think of it; I am ashamed of that part 
of the history of this nation, and of 
such doings as those; my heart bleeds 
for what your people have suffered." 
When he was speaking to me, the tears 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ran down his cheeks. I took him into 
our little chapel, and showed him there 
the stand where we have two Ameri- 
can flags draped, and in the center of 
those two flags the picture of George 
Washington, and I showed him that we 
reverence our flag. He turned to me 
and said, "I think you reverence this 
flag too much," I said, "It was not the 
flag that persecuted this people; it was 
not the Constitution that oppressed us, 
but it was the men who stood at the 
head of the mobs, and they are the men 
whom God will hold responsible in the 
life to come. They will have to ac- 
count for the things that they have 
done in the flesh. We respect that flag, 
and we will do our utmost to maintain 
the freedom that has been guaranteed 
unto us and all other people under that 
flag." 

This Gospel, my brethren and sisters, 
is true. It is the power of God unto 
salvation unto all who believe and 
obey it. It is making inroads among 
the thinking classes of all nations, and 
they are beginning to take notice of us. 
I heard one of the Apostles prophecy 
that all nations would yet come to us 
to learn various arts and sciences of 
peace, and the science of civil govern- 
ment. They would come to us to learn 
how to govern the nations. The things 
that Brother Goddard has been telling 
us this morning have brought these 
thoughts to my mind vividly. The or- 
ganization of the people, the organiza- 
tion of the Church, has been established 
by divine wisdom. It is complete in 
every detail: and. as we heard yester- 
day, if three men are taken away 
twelve men immeditely take their place, 
and it is an impossibility to destroy this 
great work. It is an impossibility to 
frustrate the designs of the Almighty. 
When any man or woman stands in the 
way, and undertakes to thwart the ef- 
forts that are being put forth to pro- 
claim this Gospel unto the people, God 
will bring their efforts to naught, He 
will frustrate them. Shame will be 
brought upon their own heads. 

This is the work of the Lord, and He 
will prosper it. May God bless nid help 



us to appreciate it, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

I desire to read a few verses of Scrip- 
ture, found in First Corinthians, second 
chapter, commencing at the first verse. 
It is a saying of Paul to the church in 
Corinth: 

"And I, brethren, when I came to 
you, came not with excellency of speecn 
or of wisdom, declaring unto you the 
testimony of God. For I determined 
not to know anything among you save 
Jesus Christ and Him crucified. And 
I was with you in weakness, and in 
fear, and in much trembling. And my 
speech and my preaching was not with 
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in 
demonstration of the spirit and power, 
that your faith should not stand in the 
wisdom of men, but in the power of 
God." 

Yesterday afternoon we listened to 
very interesting discourses from broth- 
ers Penrose and Roberts in regard to 
the great latter-day work; and strong 
testimonies have been borne through- 
out the entire conference. The breth- 
ren have been led apparently to testify 
of the goodness of God toward His peo- 
ple, and also of the faithfulness and 
good character of the men who stand 
at the head of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Men have 
endeavored to entice people away from 
this Church, by saying that the Lord 
has rejected it, and there are some who 
have been weak in the faith, and who 
are weak at the present time, that can 
perhaps be influenced by these men 
who rise against those whom the Lord 
has appointed. But I desire to draw 
your attention to these words which I 
have read on this occasion, not that I 
intend to make it a text, yet I wish 
to express a thought in connection with 
them. 

When Christ sent out His Apostles in 
ancient days. He sent fishermen, not 
the Rabbis of the Jewish people, but 
men who were numbered among the 
rank and file of the Jewish people, fish- 
ermen from the sea of Galilee, publi- 
pans and sinners. The Lord chose 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 



67 



them to be His messengers. In read- 
ing the history about these men, how 
they went forth after Christ had been 
crucified and had risen from the dead, 
we stand face to face with that which 
we find in these words of Paul. These 
men did not go forth in their own 
strength, but the power of Goa was 
with them. In going forth to testify 
to that which they had seen and heard 
they were not permitted to do so un- 
til they were endowed by the power of 
God from on high. Do you not re- 
member how they were told to tarry 
in Jerusalem and not open their mouths 
in regard to who Jesus of Nazareth 
was until the Holy Ghost should come 
upon them, not until then were they 
permitted to testify of that which they 
knew. We follow with great interest 
the labors of these men, and note how 
strong they were. We find them com- 
mencing their labors on the day of 
Pentecost; these fishermen were able 
to speak the word of God in power 
and great demonstration to the mul- 
titude assembled upon that occasion. 
We follow them, I say, and discover 
that even Paul, who was, as we have 
learned, an educated man as compared 
with the others, yet he did not desire 
to know anything, or did not claim to 
know anything, except Jesus Christ and 
him crucified, and so he came not with 
enticing speech to Corinth, but he came 
with the power of God. 

I desire to draw your attention to this 
fact, my brethren and sisters, that that 
has also been the history of this dis- 
pensation in which we are called upon 
to take part. Joseph Smith, the Pro- 
phet, was a farmer, unlearned, like 
the disciples of old, but in the power of 
God in the strength of his Master, and 
that was the secret bf his success and 
the influence he had over his fellow 
men. We find that after he passed away 
the Church grew, and another was ap- 
pointed in his stead as President of this 
Church. Now come some of our friends 
from the outside and say, he had fallen 
away, he was rejected, Brigham Young 
was not the inspired man that Joseph 
Smith had been. 
Let us not enter into a long discus- 



sion, but let us see what it was that 
Brigham Young accomplished in the 
world, as compared with the great work 
commenced by the Prophet Joseph. Jo- 
seph was a mightv man, and was the 
means of seeding tha Gospel to some 
sections of the United States, to Cana- 
da and also to Great Britain; and in his 
day, also, the first foreign mission was 
opened, that is to a people who speak 
other than the English language. It 
was left for the days of Brigham Young 
to demonstrate the great powers of the 
Church in a missionary way. Very 
soon after President Brigham Young 
came to the front, the gospel as re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph was not 
confined to the Anglo-Saxon race of 
people who speak the English language 
on both sides of the Atlantic ocean, but 
was sent over to continental Europe, 
and there for the first time it was heard 
among the people dwelling in that land. 
It is an easy matter for us to under- 
stand that to preach the gospel to a 
foreign nation, or people who speak for- 
eign languages, is not a very easy 
task. Sometimes we think the mission* 
aries who are called to the various 
parts of this country or Great Britain 
have an easy time as compared with 
those who go abroad and have to learn 
new languages. Some of us who have 
passed through it know what it means 
to acquire a knowledge of a new lan- 
guage and speak to people in a for- 
eign tongue. In foreign countries they 
have little knowledge of our country 
and its institutions, and do not love 
the flag and the institutions of this 
country as we do. And when these mes- 
sengers went from this country and 
testified of angels having visited the 
earth, and of God's revealing Him- 
self and sending His Son to teach 
the children of men, they 
found that men were inclined 
to say, "That is American hum- 
bug just like the rest we have heard 
coming from America!" It was no easy 
task for the first Elders who went to 
France, who went to Italy, and who 
went to the Scandinavian countries, to 
make those people believe that there 
was anything real in the message they 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



had come across the water to bring to 
the people. Let me tell you now, if 
those men had gone forth as ordinary 
men do, if they had not been backed by 
the spirit of inspiration, the Spirit of 
God, they never could have opened the 
doors in those lands. The people would 
not have received them, but would have 
rejected their testimony, because it was 
so contrary to anything they had been 
led to expect or believe. But the fact 
is that these men went abroad with a 
double power. The facts are that the 
Lord did not reject His Church, or 
withdraw His power, but He increased 
His power. In the days of Brigham 
Young the Gospel was sent abroad not 
only to English speaking people, but 
to people who speak many other dif- 
ferent languages, and the blessings of 
the Gospel followed in those lands, just 
on the same principle as they followed 
in Tennessee or in Kentucky or in New 
York or Boston, or any place where 
the first Elders of the Church preach- 
ed the Gospel. And this is a great tes- 
timony to us if we reflect upon it. 

Just a word in regard to the opposi- 
tion. You will remember that when 
the first Church, the Church establish- 
ed by Christ and His Apostles, that 
when men went into unbelief and the 
people ceased to keep the command- 
ments, the Lord withdrew His blessings 
from that Church, and the first excuse 
they had to make was something to 
satisfy the people as to why the gifts 
and blessings of the Gospel had ceas- 
ed. There was no such outpouring of 
the Spirit of God upon men in the sec- 
ond century as in the first. And so they 
invented this story for the purpose of 
pacifying the people: These things, 
the gifts and blessings of the Gospel, 
have ceased because they are no longer 
necessary. V,ery much flatter, when 
such men as John Wesley glanced out 
upon the past, he said, that is not the 
reason. There is another reason, it 
was, he said, because Christians had 
turned heathen again, that is the true 
reason why the blessings and gifts of 
the Gospel ceased among the children 
of men. Now, my brethren and sisters, 
if the true church of Christ in this age 



had been rejected of God, the first thing 
we would have had to find an excuse 
for would be why the blessings and 
gifts of the Gospel had ceased, why 
there was no demonstration of the pow- 
er of God as there was in the beginning. 
The fact that these things have contin- 
ued in the Church, the fact that they 
have increased in the Church, the fact 
that there have been abundant wit- 
nesses raised up in this land as well 
as in every land where the Gospel has 
been sent, has been and ought to be 
in and of itself one of the grandest 
proofs we can have in regard to the di- 
vinity of this church and the perpetu- 
ity of it. 

I feel to bear my testimony to the 
inspiration of these men. I know that 
God is with this people, and that the 
power of God is with His servants, not 
only as we see it demonstrated here at 
this conference, but as we go abroad 
in the different missions. We have 
heard from one mission here today, 
and we may hear from more. We 
will find that the testimony of the truth 
has followed, that wherever the Elders 
go the power of God is with them. 
They may not be learned men, that is, 
there are not so many that are learned 
among our people as among some oth- 
er people, but the power of God is with 
them, the demonstration of the Holy 
Spirit goes with them wherever they 
go, and paves the way before them, and 
causes them to have success in regard 
to making converts. 

I testify to you, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that I know the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, as it is 
now existing in the midst of the earth, 
is directed by the power of God, and 
that the Lord has not ceased to strive 
with His people, that the Lord does nof 
withhold His power or His gifts or His 
blessings from those who desire to keep 
His commandments and who walk in 
the paths of righteousness. So far as 
our leaders are concerned, I wish we 
could sustain' President Joseph F. Smith 
not only as Trustee-in-Trust in a gen- 
eral way, but I wish from the bottom 
of my heart that we could sustain him 
also as President of the United Order. 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



69 



that he should direct among this peo- 
ple more of the material things that 
we need in the world. I think that it is 
proper and right that we should Jmild 
up Zion. temporally as well as spiritu- 
ally. We find sometimes that our mis- 
sionaries, when they return from 
abroad and our emigrants when they 
come to us from foreign lands, cannot 
find employment when they come to 
Zion. We feel as if we are not strong 
enough financially. We are here to 
build up a sample community, a com- 
monwealth that partakes of a tem- 
poral as well as spiritual nature. In 
these mountains we have been permit- 
ted to dwell in peace for a number of 
years, and it is the only place, up to 
that time, upon God's footstool where 
the Latter-day Saints have ever found 
a resting place. And I will say, if we 
have confidence in our leaders, if there 
is an accusation against them as to 
temporal affairs, I would prefer that 
our fiancial affairs be directed by them 
even more than they are at the present 
time, that we might prosper in tempor- 
al as well as in spiritual matters, that 
Zion may grow and prosper, that we 
may be a community that will be re- 
spected in all parts of the world. May 
God bless you, I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH. 
{President of Southern States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, it is not 
intended that this Church shall be 
merely one of a Gospel of spiritual sal- 
vation, but it is intended that it shall 
be the Gospel of temporal salvation 
as well. It is the duty of the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood to look after the 
spiritual affairs of this Church, and 
it is the duty of the Aaronic Priesthood 
of this Church to look after the tem- 
poral affairs; and I hope the day will 
never come when this people will ob- 
ject to the Church dealing in temporal 
affairs. Just the moment that spirit 
takes possession of you, then you are 
in a very bad position. Just as soon 
as an individual finds fault, and begins 
to fight against the authorities of this 
Church, then he is on the road to 



apostasy, and he had better turn 
around and retrace his steps, or that 
disease will take hold of him, sooner 
or later. You know sometimes it takes 
a long while for an individual to apos- 
tatize. He travels on that train day 
and night, sometimes for years, until 
he finally lands at the station. I 
heard an individual say in this city 
that he had been an apostate for 15 
years before he knew it. 

The future would look very black to 
me if I did not have a knowledge that 
what the world calls "Mormonism" is 
indeed God's divine truth; that when 
it was set up upon the earth, it was 
with a promise from the Almighty 
that it never more would be thrown 
down. If you will examine the word- 
ing of the Prophet Daniel, you will see 
it intimated there that the work of 
the Lord has been upon the earth many 
times and been thrown down, and the 
Lord knew that it would be thrown 
down. But, in interpreting that dream 
of Nebuchadnezzar's, Daniel said that 
the little stone that the king saw cut 
out of the mountain without hands, 
represented the kingdom that God was 
going to set up upon the earth in the 
latter-days, never more to be thrown 
down or given to another people. Just 
as he saw that little stone grow and 
increase in strength and size until it 
became a great mountain and filled the 
whole earth, so it was the intention 
that the kingdom organized by the 
Great God in the last days would never 
grow less, but would continue to grow 
larger until it filled the whole earth 
with the righteousness of God. 

I know there are individuals who 
claim that it was thrown down, became 
disorganized,, and the little stone 
crumbled, went into decay, for about 
16 years. When an individual makes a 
statement of that kind, he verily says 
that God Almighty has been defeated 
by the Devil, that His words were not 
true, that when it came upon the earth 
in the last days it would stand forever 
but that the Almighty has been defeat- 
ed by the adversary. 

We have a Temple here, and I was 
thinking, when Brother Goddard was 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



speaking, do we as a people firmly be- 
lieve in all that that Temple stands for, 
the work for which it is designed? If 
I could make my voice reach every 
wealthy man there is in the Church, I 
would say to them, do you believe that 
the work can be done in that house for 
which it was built, for the dead? Do 
you believe that on the other side of 
the veil missionaries are preaching the 
Gcspel to the spirits in prison, and that 
a work must be done for them here, 
that the living must do vicarious wor*K 
for the dead? You endow colleges, and 
different institutions, but I would like 
to see some of the wealthy men of this 
Church endow that Temple with a por - 
tion of the means God has given to 
them, that when they stand on the 
other side of the veil, and enter the 
missionary fields in the spirit world, 
they can say they were not stingy with 
the means the Almighty had given to 
them, but that a portion of it had been 
left to furnish food for those who of- 
ficiate in the Temple, doing work for 
the dead who are on the other side. I 
don't know that I have read the will 
of a single rich man yet who has 
thought of that, but I believe he has 
not been in the spirit world 15 minutes 
before he would see the necessity of it, 
and he would feel like saying, "O God, 
let me go back a few hours to earth 
again, let me go back and tell my 
brethren of the necessity for leaving 
some of these means, that food may 
be provided for those who must labor 
all one day to do the Temple work for 
one individual in the spirit world." T 
believe if a wealthy man went into the 
spirit world after following this ad- 
vice, he would meet with hearty hand- 
shakes from those in the other world, 
because he had made it possible that a 
work might be done in the Temp'e, 
thjfit the dead might be robed with the 
powers of the Priesthood on the other 
side of the veil, and clothed with the 
authority that has been given and be- 
stowed upon those who received the 
truth while upon the earth. 

I may be very pronounced in thesj 
matters, but I know that it is right, 
there is no question about it. If you 



give all that you have to the Church, 
and all that you ever expect to have 
in this world, and leave it for work 
for the dead in the Temple, you would 
still be in debt to the Church, for what 
the Church has done for you. I feel 
that I can never pay the debt of grati- 
tude I owe the Church for what it has 
done for me. 

When I was listening to Brother Mc- 
Rae speaking of the necessity for more 
workers in the missionary field, I 
wished that every one of you was called 
upon a mission. We need you. I 
want you to listen to a few statistics. A 
few years ago, in the Southern States, 
we had 560 missionaries. In the state 
of Kentucky alone we had 117, now we 
have only seven pairs of Elders in three 
conferences of that state today to keep 
alive the seed that was planted by the 
117 Elders. In the great state of Ten- 
nessee we have eleven pairs of Elders. 
In the state of Florida we have eight 
pairs. In the state of Gorgia we have 
ten pairs, and in the state of Mississippi 
we have six pairs. In the state of 
North Carolina we have eight pairs. 
Ohio, with six millions of people, has 
only five pairs of Elders. And that 
is the way it goes. We could place all 
the Elders that we have in the South- 
ern States in any one state in that 
mission. We have got 8,600 Saints in 
that mission, and on account of not 
having Elders enough to Visit them 
when they move, and find their where- 
abouts, we have lost track of about 1,500 
or 2,000 of them. Once in a while let- 
ters come from some of them, saying 
they have not seen an Elder for 15 to 
18 months. And now I want to say, 
God will hold you responsible if you do 
not magnify the Priesthood, and make 
yourself an ecclesiastical warrior to go 
into the world and preach the Gospel of 
Christ wherever you have an oppor- 
tunity. 

We have many things to contend with 
in the missionary field. Our Elders 
ure met upon the right hand and upon 
the left by all kinds of arguments. A 
great deal has been said about those 
who oppose us in the so-called re-or- 
ganized church. There are Elders of 



ELDER BEN E. RICH. 



71 



that church in the world today claiming 
they are not antagonistic to any de- 
nomination in the United States except- 
ing the Utah Mormons. They want 
to be in harmony with the rest of the 
world. They follow in the footsteps 
of our Elders, and, when they cease 
speaking, these representatives of the 
apostate organization will stand up and 
say to the people, "These men are Brig- 
hamites; no doubt they all have got 
more wives than one; they are repre- 
sentatives of the organization that was 
responsible for the Mountain Meadow 
Massacre, and they believe in blood- 
atonement." That is the kind of doc- 
trines they lay before the people of the 
world, following our missionaries. That 
is the kind of sentiments that prevail 
in their breasts. Then they come to 
one who has just been baptized, and 
say, "Do you know, brother, do you 
know, sister, what takes place there in 
Utah. If any tithing is paid, it goes 
for the support of these men who are 
living in abomination, and whisky is 
carried into their houses by the bucket- 
full." That is the kind of argument. 
If any of the Elders of the Reorganized 
church don't believe this statement, I 
can back it up with evidence; and if 
they do not resent it, then they are re- 
sponsible. 

I know I am looked upon as very 
radical. In fact, it is said that brother 
Golden Kimball and myself swear once 
in a while. I .think that if J esus would 
come here He would express His 
opinion of some people in almost similar 
language to that used sometimes by 
Brother Golden Kimball. 

Once Israel was united, and then God 
delivered the law to Moses. But the 
time came when their Prophets went to 
sleep, and the people became disunited, 
Eventually they severed asunder, under 
the headings of Pharisees, Sadducees, 
and Essenes. Then Jesus came with 
a revelation from God to them, and 
offered them the Gospel fruit, and 
prayed that they might be one even as 
the Father and He were one. After a 
little while the early Christian band 
allowed their Prophets to go to sleep, 
and down in the ages they became sev- 
erd and eventually were known as 



Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopal- 
ians, Catholics, and the Lord only 
knows what else. Then, in the nine- 
teenth century, God once more gave 
light from heaven. Once more the 
Gospel fruit was offered to mankind. 
Again it was opposed by the leaders of 
religious organizations, as it was op- 
posed by the leaders of other religious 
organizations when Jesus brought it 
first. 

Now then if you will not consider 
Jesus too radical and too harsh, I will 
read to you what He said about this 
when He was here; then you have got 
my opinion of just w T hat He would say 
if He came to the earth again. Here 
it is in the 23rd chapter of Matthew: 

"Then spake Jesus to the multitude 
and to His disciples, saying: Thp 
Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' 
seat; all, therefore, whatsoever they bid 
you observe, that observe and do.but do 
not yet after their works, for they say 
and do not. For they bind heavy bur- 
dens and grievous to be borne, and lay 
them on men's shoulders; but they 
themselves will not move them with 
one of their nngers. But all their works 
they do for to be seen of men; they 
make broad their phylacteries, and en- 
large the borders of their garments, 
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts 
arid the chief seats in the synagogues, 
and greetings in the markets, and to 
be called of men. Rabbi, Rabbi. But be 
ye not called Rabbi, for one is your 
master, even Christ; and all ye are 
brethren. . . . But woe unto you, 
scribes and Pharasees, hypocrites, for 
ye shut up the kingdom of heaven 
against men; for ye neither go in your- 
selves, neither suffer ye them that are 
entering to go in. Woe unto you. 
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for 
ye devour widows' houses, and for a 
pretence make long prayer; therefore 
ye shall receive the greater damna- 
tion. Wo unto you, scribes and Phari- 
sees, hypocrites, for ye compass sea and 
h n ' t" maKe onp proseiyte, anl when 
he is made ye make him two-fold more 
the child of hell than yourselves. Woe 
unto you, ye blind guides which say, 
whosoever shall swear by the temple, it 
is nothing: but whosoever shal swear 
by the gold of the temple, he is a debt- 
or Ye fools and blind, for whether is 
greater, the gold or the temple that 
•sanctifieth the gold? And whosoever

gift? Whosoever therefore shall swear 
by the altar, sweareth by it and by all 
things thereon, and whosoever shaft 
swear by the temple, sweareth by it ami 
by him that dwelleth therein. And lie 
that shall swear by heaven sweareth by

and Pharisees, hypocritss, for ye pay 
tithe of mint and anise and Cumm.m, 
and have omitted the weightier matters 
of the law, judgment, mercy and faith; 
these ought ye to have done, and not 
to leave . the other undone. Ye blind 
guides which strain at a gnat and swal- 
low a camel. Woe unto ye, scribes and 
■Pharlf-hes, hypocrites, 'for ye make 
clean the outside of the cup and of the

the cup and platter, that the outside of 
them may be clean also. Woe unto you, 
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for 
ye are like unto whited sepulchres, 
which indeed appear beautiful outward; 
but are within full of dead men's bones 
and of all uncleanness. Even so ye 
also outwardly appear righteous unto 
men, but within ye are full of hypoc- 
risy and iniouity. Woe unto you, 
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, be- 
cause ye build the tombs of the proph- 
ets and garnish the sepulchres of th'S 
righteous, and say, if we had, been in 
the days of our fathers, we would not 
have been partakers with them in the 1 
blood of the pronhets. Wherefore y> A 
be witnesses unto yourselves that ye 
are the children of th^m which kille d 
the pronhets. Pill ye up then the measure 
of your fathers. Te serpents, ye gen ■ 
eration of vipers, how can ye escape 
the damnation of hell? Wherefore, be- 
hold I send unto you prophets, and 
wise men, and scribes; and some of 
them ye shall scourge in your syna- 
gogues and persecute them from city 
to city, that upon you may come all 
the righteous blood shed upon the earth 
from the blood of righteous Abel unto 
the bloo'l of Z^charias son of "Rar^chias. 
v-hom vp «*lew between the temple and 
the altar." 

Now I want to say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that among those who 
stand at the head of the churches ofi 
the world there are many good, kind, 
conscientious gentlemen: but I will say 
further, that I firmly believe that those 
who lead the tirade of abuse against 
this people, and still occupy prominent 
seats in modern synagogues, are of the 
same class spoken of by Jesus of Naz- 
areth; and if He were to come back 
again and speak to a congregation He 
would deliver the same sermon He de- 
livered when He was here before. 



If you don't know that this work 
comes from God, ask, and the informa- 
tion will be given you. Ask in faith, 
and then you will know. I testify, 
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ has 
been restored to the earth, in fulfill- 
ment of prophecy, and I testify to it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

hymn, "How firm a foundation," etc.

ELDER THOMAS E. BASSETT. 

(President of Fremont Stake.) 
My heart is filled with joy, my dear 
brethren and sisters, at witnessing the 
wonderful success, the very large at- 
tendance and the moat excellent spirit 
that has prevailed at this conference. 
Never, in my experience in this church, 
have I felt that the subjects treated 
upon have been more timely than they 
have been at the meetings of this con- 
ference. Seeing the very large attend- 
ance assures me forcibly that the evil 
speaking and comments derogatory to 
the character of our leaders, that are 
being indulged in by our opponents, are 
beneficial, bringing this people together, 
and demonstrating to the whole world 
that we are true to each other. We do 
not fully realize the love and affec- 
tion that is down deep in the hearts of 
this people, toward each other and to- 
ward our leaders, until we are attacked. 
Then are manifested those ties of affec- 
tion and love that bind our hearts to- 
gether, and make us one in Christ 
Jesus, more than family ties. I thank 
my Heavenly Father for this feeling 
that we have in our hearts toward each 
other and toward our leaders, the kind 
and generous feeling that we enjoy 
when we are in the discharge of our du- 
ties. I appreciate that as much as any 
other blessing I have ever enjoyed. 
There is no joy that can come to the 
human heart, there is no blessing that 
is more appreciated, no feeling more

pleasant than the love that character- 
izes every true Latter-day Saint. Our 
Savior said that the first great com- 
mandment was, "Thou shalt love the 
Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, with 
all they might, mind and strength; and 
the second commandment is like unto 
it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. Upon these two great com- 
mandments hang all the law and the 
prophets." I have often been impress- 
ed with the fact that it would be ex- 
tremely easy for us to perform every 
duty that is required of us, as Latter- 
day Saints, if we really possessed that 
love to the extent that we should. Of 
all the 'duties of the Gospel, all the re- 
quirements that are made of us, wheth- 
er it be to contribute our mites for the 
support of the poor, for the erection 
of meetinghouses, or institutions of 
learning for our young people, for the 
sending of missionaries abroad to the 
nations of the earth to preach the Gos- 
pel, or whether it be the sacrifice of 
our homes and all that we possess on 
earth — all these things would be cheer- 
fully given did we but love the Lord, 
our God, with all our mind, might and 
strength and our neighbor as ourselves. 
There would be little need of admonish- 
ing the people to attend to their pray- 
ers; and little need of admonishing 
them to pay their tithes and offerings, 
and attend their meetings and to do 
other things that are incumbent upon 
Latter-day Saints. 

The burden of the instructions during 
this conference has been to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to banish from our 
hearts all feelings of animosity, bitter- 
ness, hate and enmity that we may en- 
tertain toward any one. If we do not 
forgive our brother his trespasses 
there remains in us the greater sin. 
The object of the Gospel is to build 
up, to benefit, to strengthen and to 
bless and comfort the human family. 
That is our mission, we are here to do 
good, we are here to build up, we are 
here to extend a helping hand to any 
brother or sister who is oppressed, to 
reach out the hand of kindness to each 
other, to be forgiving. 

"We are all full of weaknesses, faults 
of mortality, there are none of us that 



are perfect. There is not one within 
the sound of my voice this afternoon 
that has not transgressed to a greater 
or less extent during his life. When we 
are inclined to find fault with our 
brother or sister, let us investigate our 
own soul and it is probable we will then 
find more fault with ourselves than we 
can with our brethren and sisters. 

Another admonition of the prophet of 
the Lord to this people for several years 
has been to get out of debt. These two 
points, as they have impressed me dur- 
ing this conference, have been suffi- 
cient to repay me for the time and 
means I have spent in coming some- 
thing more than 200 miles to attend this 
conference. I sincerely hope that these 
two great principles, the importance of 
the Latter-day Saints loving each oth- 
er, being true to each other, standing 
(shoulder to shoulder, extending the 
hand of kindness to each other, and 
the other great principle that has been 
advocated, to get out of debt — I sincere- 
ly trust that these two great topics, 
may burn down deep into the heart of 
every person who has attended this 
conference. 

It was a source of regret to listen to 
the statement of one of our brethren 
yesterday who rather questioned wheth- 
er the Latter-day Saints were any more 
out of debt today than they were when 
the Prophet Joseph F. Smith gave this 
counsel two or three years ago. If we 
have not profited by this admonition, 
the responsibility rests upon our shoul- 
ders, for it has certainly come to us in 
no unmistakable terms, as being the 
mind and will of our Heavenly Father. 
If we continue to remain in that con- 
dition, without lifting the obligations 
that are resting upon our shoulders, 
we t shall have to stand the conse- 
quences. The day may come that the 
people will be urgently required to pay 
their obligations to those that they are 
in debt to, and perhaps have their 
hemes and farms sold in consequence. 
It would be a fearful thing, brothers 
and sisters, to contemplate that, in 
the face of this good and wholesome 
counsel coming from men whom we 
revere as inspired of our Heavenly 
Father.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



I hope that we will feel the import- 
ance of this, my brothers and sisters. 
Latter-day Saints should not be ob- 
ligated to the people of the world. Our 
Heavenly Father has said to Israel 
that they should be lenders and not 
borrowers. Every good and perfect 
blessing that can come to mortal man 
is the right of every Latter-day Saint 
to enjoy. All the wealth and riches of 
this earth, and all other blessings that 
our Heavenly Father has vouchsafed, 
the Latter-day Saints are entitled to 
through faithfulness. I do not know of 
any greater trouble or vexation that 
can come to the human heart than to 
be burdened with a load of debt. To 
be thoroughly miserable a man needs 
only to obligate himself, to become in- 
volved in debt. If we want to bi 
happy let us extricate ourselves from 
this bon.dage. Let us be a free people, 
as our Heavenly Father has designed 
that we should be. He has established 
us here, in the midst of these rocky 
mountains, for a wise and glorious 
purpose, in fulfilment of utterances of 
the prophets made many hundreds of 
years ago. He designs to make us a 
great people. Let us be true to each 
other, and true to our file leaders, 
which I feel sure we will be. We will 
be true to our brethren who are called 
to lead us. We know they are men 
of God; we know they are humble, and 
that they do not seek to aggrandize 
themselves at the expense of their fel- 
lows, notwithstanding all the hard 
things that are said against them by 
those who are seeking to tear them 
down. 

I bear testimony to you that I know 
this is the work of God; I know that 
our Heavenly Father has a watchful 
eye over this people, and all we need to 
do is to remain true to the covenants 
we have made with Him, and He will 
sustain us. May God be with you, and 
bless you. my brothers and sisters. 
May love abound in your homes, at 
your firesides, in your gatherings; may 
the peace of heaven be with us all, I 
ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER OLEEN L. STOHL, 
(President of Boxelder Stake.) 
My brothers and sisters, I most hum- 
bly desire that what I shall say to you 
this afternoon may be directed by the 
Spirit of the Lord. I have very much 
rejoiced in being permitted to attend 
this general conference of the Church; 
and, beginning with the first meeting 
and continuing to the present time, I 
have felt that it was never my privi- 
lege to attend a conference of the 
Church, where I experienced a greater 
outpouring of the power of God than I 
have done in this. We frequently hear 
it stated by our brethren and 
sisters who attend these confer- 
ences that the last conference is al- 
ways the best. I believe we can testify 
to that truthfully, in the case of this 
conference; and I believe further, thai 
this is just as it should be. If the 
Latter-day Saints are living their re- 
ligion, as God has required of us that 
we should, we will be entitled to in- 
creased outpourings of His Spirit; con- 
sequently each conference we attend 
will appear to be the best. I have 
thought that I never witnessed more 
enthusiasm, nor did I ever notice a 
more hearty vote for the authorities of 
our Church than that which was mani- 
fest in sustaining them at the confer- 
ence meeting on last Friday afternoon. 
It was gratifying to me to see that, 
when our file leaders are attacked, the 
rank and file of the Latter-day Saints 
are ready to resent those attacks by 
showing to their leaders their loyal 
support for them. They also must feel- 
gratified in seeing the loyalty, and en- 
thusiasm with which the Latter-day 
Saints have come to this conference and 
taken part in its proceedings. I am 
thankful that I can say that I was born 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, that I was born here in the 
valleys of the mountains. Under tho 
direction of my parents, it has been my 
privilege to attend the conferences and 
meetings which have been held in the 
locality where I have lived. I have had 
great interest in reflecting over my past 
life, and my experiences in connection 
with this Church, and in considering 



ELDER OLEEN N. STOHL. 



75 



that which I have heard come from our 
leaders. It was my privilege to listen 
to President Brigham Young instruct 
the Latter-day Saints, and, though I 
was only a boy, I remember very dis- 
tinctly a number of the discourses I 
heard him deliver, and the counsel I 
heard him give to the Latter-day 
Saints. Since that time I have heard 
all of the leaders of the Church, the 
presidents of the Church, and the 
Apostles that were associated with 
them, instruct the Latter-day Saints. 
I say to you, my brothers and sisters, 
that during my entire lifetime and ex- 
perience-, I never heard one of those 
brethren enunciate a doctrine unto the 
people, that was in any degree degrad- 
ing, or that, in any respect, would tend 
to lower the manhood or womanhood of 
any son or daughter of God. On the 
other hand, I testify to you, sincerely, 
that everything I have heard them 
teach, the principles they have brought 
before the people, the counsels they 
have given, have been of a nature to 
uplift the sons and daughters of God, 
if they would live in accordance with 
them. I feel to say, thank God for the 
men who have stood at the head of this 
Church, for the leaders whom He has 
raised up to direct this people*. I 
do not know that there is any greater 
evidence of the divinity of their work 
than that which we see at the present 
time. There never was a time in the 
history of the Church when it was 
stronger than it is today; and I be- 
lieve there never was a time in the 
Church when we experienced more of 
the power of God in it than we do to- 
day. 

I am pleased to say to you that, in 
the stake where I have the honor to 
preside. I have never seen a time when 
the presidency and the High Council 
of that stake were more united, or more 
anxious to perform their duties than 
they are today, anxious to labor among 
the people, anxious to do their duty 
and direct in the affairs of that part 
of the Lord's vineyard. I have been 
well pleased in noticing, during the 
recent month or two ,the great inter- 
est manifest in the opening of our 
Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement 



associations. "We have never before 
seen such devotedness and zeal mani- 
fest as we have observed during the 
opening of this season's work. We 
hope and expect, to see the same earn- 
estness in relation to the young men's 
M. I. associations when they begin 
their work, and so also with the quo- 
rums of the Priesthood. Now, this all 
shows to me that there is faith among 
the Latter-day Saints, they are not 
dead, they are not waning from their 
first love of the Gospel, but that it 
still burns in their hearts, and they are 
desirous and anxious to do all that lies 
in their power to perform their duty in 
building up the kingdom of God. How 
is it that we occupy this position to- 
day, that we are stronger than we 
ever were before? I bear my testimony 
that it is because God has raised up 
great and good men as our leaders, 
who have been inspired by His Spirit 
to lead and direct the Latter-day Saints 
in the way that they should go, and 
because of our obedience to their teach- 
ings and instructions, we have attain- 
ed the growth and strength that we 
now witness and enjoy in the Church. 

How inconsistent it is, my brothers 
and sisters, for our enemies to say to 
the body of the Church, "You are all 
right, you people are all right; those 
who are wrong are the leaders of the 
Church. It is that body of men we are 
after, that we desire to pull down, be- 
cause they have transgressed; but you 
are going in. the right path, everything 
is well with you; the leaders are the 
ones that have stepped to one side." 
How ridiculous and inconsistent it is 
for anybody to make that kind of 
statement. We are what we are today, 
as the body of the Church, because we 
have accepted the counsels and teach- 
ings of our leaders; and, if we had 
only lived closer to their councils and 
teachings, as a Church, we would have 
been much stronger today even than 
we are. I say to you that if we will 
continue in the future to abide by their 
counsels we will become a strong and 
mighty people. I am thankful for the 
testimony I have in relation to the 
divinity of this work, and for the 
standing I have in the Church of Christ 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



today; and I feel that this is some- 
thing every Latter-day Saint must ap- 
preciate. We certainly must admit 
that the Church has been a great bless- 
ing to us and that through our al- 
legiance to that Church, and affilia- 
tion with it. we have received many 
great and wonderful blessings. We 
know that those who are living their 
religion today in this Church, and who 
are endeavoring to keep the com- 
mandments of God, are not the dis- 
gruntled ones, they are not the ones 
who are complaining about the au- 
thorities of the Church. We find that 
those who are making complaints, and 
expressing dissatisfaction are those 
who have not kept the counsels and 
admonitions of God that have come to 
the people through our leaders. Nor 
are they the ones who have lived in 
accordance with the Gospel as it has 
been made known to us. 

We know, those of us who 
have obeyed the doctrine, that 
great blessings come to us through obe- 
dience to the law of tithing. In connec- 
tion with this I say it is not they who 
pay their tithes who are complaining 
today in relation to the principle of 
tithing. It is not they who are fearful 
as to the handling of their tithing, of 
as to whether it is properly distributed 
or not. You will find, upon investiga- 
tion, that those who are finding fault, 
who are making these complaints, are 
those who fail to pay their tithes. 
I believe this principle is attacked be- 
cause our enemies think they can have 
more influence with some of the weak 
members of the Church. They have 
an idea that if you attack or touch the 
pocket of a man, you can appe'al to 
him by virtue of that supposed fact 
and may thus succeed in turning hint 
away from the church, and get him to 
refuse to lend his support. Those who 
have tested this principle, who have 
proven this doctrine, will not be influ- 
enced by that sophistry. That kind of 
argument will not appeal to them, be- 
cause they have proven the doctrine for 
themselves; they know that it is true, 
and that blessings are poured out in 
obedience to that principle, as God ha? 
promised that they would be. They arci 
blessed, not only in a spiritual way, but 



they are also blessed temporally. They 
are satisfied and contented, and ac- 
knowledge to their Father that they 
have been built up spiritually and tem- 
porally through obedience to that law; 
not only by the observance of that law 
but every other law pertaining to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ as we have ac- 
cepted it. If we will thus prove the 
doctrine, brethren and sisters, put it to 
the test, we will never apostatize from 
the Church. They who apostatize and 
leave the Church are they who have 
failed to prove the doctrine, and who 
have not got faith in it. We may in- 
crease our faith by putting these prin- 
ciples into daily practice, thus testing 
them, and finding out for ourselves 
whether they are true or not. I testify 
to you, that my experience, short as it 
has been in the Church, is this, that 
whenever I have obeyed a principle of 
the gospel and put it to the test, I have 
never had any doubt in my mind in re- 
lation to the divinity of that principle. 
These principles are divine, and eternal, 
and if you practice them in humility, 
in accordance with the spirit of the 
Gospel, you will have a testimony of the 
divinity of the work. 

As I said before I thank God for the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I thank God that I am per- 
mitted to live in the day and dispensa- 
tion of the world when He raised up a 
prophet, and when He and His Son 
came to earth, and visited and did com- 
mune with that boy, and counseled and 
instructed him, and continued to in- 
struct him until the result was the com- 
plete organization of the Church. I 
thank God for this, my brethren and 
sisters, and for the testimony I have 
that I know this is the work of God. Let 
us progress, let us be faithful, upright 
and God-fearing in that which we have 
to do. Let us serve the Lord. Let us 
uphold one another and the authorities 
who preside over us. I feel that when 
a man attacks the President of this 
Church he attacks me. I feel that when 
President Joseph F. Smith is villified 
and belittled by those who are our ene- 
mies, I also am attacked and belittled, 
and they are trying to besmirch my 
character, for the reason that I am in- 



ELDER NEPHI 

strumental, as one of the members of 
the Church, in helping to support and 
sustain President Joseph F. Smith in 
his position. And I feel that when he 
Is attacked, it is my duty, and it is 
your duty— or when any of his brethren 
are attacked, who stand close to him— 
it is our duty, as supporters, who have 
held up our hands to sustain them in 
positions they occupy, to lift up our 
voices in their defense. May the peace 
and blessing's of heaven continue to 
abide with us, as Latter-day Saints; 
may we have strength to perform our 
duties; if we will do so there never 
will be a time in the Church but what 
greater blessings and greater things 
than we have yet experienced will be 
poured out upon us. And that this 
blessing may follow in our behalf I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang, "S'peak to My Soul." 

ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS, 
(President of Salt Lake Stake.) 

At the conclusion of each meeting 
of this conference I have felt in my 
heart a deep sense of gratitude to our 
Heavenly Father for the personal as- 
surance he has given me of His pres- 
ence with the Saints in this great con- 
ference. I don't know that the Church 
ever saw more splendid exhibitions of 
unity, perfect harmony of feeling, a 
more magnificent display of priestly in- 
fluence than that which has been ex- 
hibited during this conference. The 
days of small things are past. The 
Kingdom of God shall not again be 
reduced to anything like its infancy; 
year by year we see it moving onward, 
increasing in strength and power, in- 
creasing in intelligence and in the vir- 
tues of the Gospel, until it has become 
a light unto the world placed upon a 
hill top, and it cannot be hid. No 
matter what circumstances may sur- 
round the Church, no matter what at- 
titude the world may maintain toward 
it, no matter how devoutly some work 
for its destruction, all the world must 
admit that "Mormonism" is moving 
steadily onward in the face of the op- 
position of the world. 

I rejoice in this exhibition of power 
and progressiveness, because the work 



L. MORRIS. 77 

of God is dear to me. and is, in fact, 
the dearest thing I know. There is 
nothing on earth which has from me 
such reverence, such an abiding con- 
fidence, as this latter-day work. 

I can easily conceive of institutions 
of 'the earth going to pieces, of na-. 
tions falling, of races being annihilated 
or absorbed by greater nations. But 
it is not within the scope of my men- 
taility to conceive of the destruction 
and annihilation of the work of God. 
Where that conviction or that feeling 
comes from, I leave you to judge. 
Whether it be from a steady growth 
of faith, from tradition or parental 
teachings, I am not, perhaps, prepared 
to say definitely. But there appears 
to me to be nothing on earth so strong, 
and so abiding, and so certain of tri- 
umph as the work of God. This too in 
the face of all the predictions that are- 
made to the contrary. 

The remarks of Elder Stohl regarding 
the compliment which is paid by our 
friends, the enemy, to the Latter-day 
Saints as a people, wherein they say, 
"we have nothing against you Mormon 
people; in fact you are a very good 
people; you are industrious, you are- 
honorable; you are, indeed, a good peo- 
ple; but your leaders are bad!" What 
a silly piece of sophistry this is. "Your 
leaders are bad, but you are good." 
Do you pluck grapes from thistles? 
Where do these leaders come from, 
are they not the fruit and the product 
of the people? When we desire to in- 
stall one in any quorum to preside, do 
we go outside of the Church to find 
him? Invariably they are taken from 
the rank and file of the priesthood, from 
the people, and they are the fruit, the 
outgrowth of the people. What gives 
me great encouragement is that the 
people and the leaders are one, and 
that the people are like the leaders; 
if the leaders are corrupt and bad, then 
so are the people. If the people are 
good, then so are the leaders, they are 
the same kith and kin. The same spir- 
it characterizes them that character- 
izes the people as a whole. What 
finer compliment could be paid to men 
than to say, that the great body of in- 



78 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



dustrious, honest people known as the 
Latter-day Saints have unlimited con- 
fidence in their leaders? This is the 
compliment which the opposition pay 
to the leaders, when they say they 
are bad, for the people, four hun- 
dred thousand strong, represented 
By leading men from every ward and 
quorum in Zion, assemble and lift their 
hands, 10,000 strong, to support those 
leaders whom the world say are cor- 
rupt. I wonder if as much could be 
said of the leaders of the opposition, if 
there are people who have confidence 
in them to trust their tithes, and if 
necessary their lives, in the hands of 
those leaders? From my personal ac- 
quaintanceship with some of these 
men, I doubt if anybody on earth has 
confidence in them; I know I have 
not. I have traveled with them, cor- 
responded with them, conversed with 
them, and have had business associa- 
tions with some of them for years, but 
I have absolutely no confidence in 
them, and I know whereof I speak. 
Among us things are altogether dif- 
ferent. It is the most inconsistent pro- 
position I ever heard made that a peo- 
ple have bad leaders when those lead- 
ers are taken from and out of the peo- 
ple. Now to a stranger, and perhaps 
to some of our old members, these 
compliments which we pay to ourselves 
may be a little offensive. I admit we 
might go to the extreme in defending 
ourselves, but we must not forget, my 
brethren and sisters, that we are put 
on the defensive. The war which is 
waged against the Latter-day Saints 
compels them to speak in their own 
defense, or they stand condemned in 
silence; and since it is their right to 
speak no one can object to their 
speaking if they wish to. We do not 
look upon our leaders as being without 
blemish and perfect. We know they 
have weaknesses, and for their weak- 
nesses we have sympathy and charity, 
because like weaknesses exist in us. If 
the leaders and the people were perfect 
there would be no use for the Gospel, 
so far as we are concerned, for the 
Gospel is the power of God unto per- 
fection, or salvation. It is a means 



to an end. and it has imperfect beings 
to deal with, and that is why we have 
the Gospel to correct our evils and im- 
prove our lives. We do not admit, 
however, that the leaders of our peo- 
ple, or that the people themselves, are 
in the slightest degree below the aver- 
age of Christian morality and disciple- 
ship. I was thinking while the breth- 
ren were speaking of a familiar pas- 
sage found in the Gospel according to 
St. Matthew. Thej' are a few of the 
sentences which fell from the Savior's 
lips while delivering His great sermon 
on the mount. Let me read three 
verses: 

"Blessed are thev which are perse- 
cuted for righteousness sake, for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are 
ye when men shall revile you, and per- 
secute you, and shall say all manner of 
evil against you falsely, for my sake. 
Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for 
great is your reward in heaven, for 
so persecuted they the prophets which 
were before you." 

"Blessed are ye when men revile 
you, and persecute you." Have we not 
been taught throughout this confer- 
ence, and throughout our lives for that 
matter, the principles of forgiveness 
and charity and loving kindness? If 
the world did not persecute us and re- 
vile us we would have nothing to for- 
give, and we would suffer a great loss 
if we had no one to offend or oppose 
us. "Blessed are ye when men per- 
secute you," because you then may 
exercise the highest virtues in the hu- 
man soul, the virtues of forgiveness 
and charity. Our blessed Savior, the 
man of sorrows, came to earth to teach 
us how to live that we might live more 
abundantly, that life might be made 
large and beautiful in its nature, that 
it might be progressive in its course; 
and His life above all other lives 
teaches us the sublime principle of for- 
giveness. He, however, was not al- 
ways meek and submissive. Not al- 
ways did he seem to allow evil and 
sin and iniquity to pass by unrebuked. 
Sometimes His soul was stirred to in- 
dignation, and in nobility, yea sub- 
limity of character did he denounce 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS.

the hypocrite, and all who loved in- 
iquity and unrighteousness, calling 
them hypocrites who garnished the 
^sepulchres and so on, made the extern- 
al look clean and white and beautiful, 
but within they were full of dead 
men's bones, and their hearts were cor- 
rupt and their inner lives unholy. They 
were not what they seemed or profess- 
ed to be. But as we reach the climax 
in His sublime career, I fancy 
He almost needed this quality of de- 
nunciation and rebuke, and in the 
Garden of Gethsemene, on Golgotha's 
hill, He opened not His mouth but to 
utter the sublime words which made 
Him very God, "Father, forgive them, 
they know not what they do." This 
is no doubt the highest ideal ever given 
to the world, and every true disciple 
of Christ must strive to attain to that 
beautiful holy type of discipleship, to 
forgive when offended, to be longsuffer- 
ing and charitable, not only with of- 
fending brothers, but with the- enemies 
who avow their wrath and hatred for 
you. Then in this light, for a mo- 
ment, contemplate the unique position 
which the Latter-day Saints occupy in 
this world. Where is there such a peo- 
ple-, who have an opportunity of for- 
giving and blessing those who revile 
and who would persecute. There is 
only one thing upon which the Chris- 
tian world are united, and that is in 
persecuting and denouncing the Latter- 
day Saints. The love of God has been 
unable to unite the Christian world for 
two thousand years, but the hate of the 
work of Christ has at last united them. 
Now, this is rathe-r strange doctrine, 
but that is how it appears to a Lat- 
ter-day Saint, and we claim the right 
to speak as we feel, so long as we 
respect other people in the same ca- 
pacity. 

I am reminded of an incident, or ra- 
ther of a few remarks made by Pres- 
ident Smith not many moths ago, dur- 
ing the recent tirade of slander, of 
which he has been the extreme object. 
He came into a convention of Sunday 
school workers, was weary and ex- 
hausted from his day's toil, but was 
asked to speak to the convention, and 



during his address he gave expression 
to these thoughts, these feelings, ra- 
ther: "To answer our enemies in the 
same angry spirit with which they at- 
tack us, would be to take the soison 
of the adder into our own hearts, and 
thereby debase ourselves to their level. 
It is better for us to say, 'Father, for- 
give them for they know not what they 
do.' But," he added, "I know that 
they do know what they are doing." 
Now, President Smith (since we are not 
in his preesnce, we may speak freely 
of him, for among the other virtues 
which he possesses is the virtue of 
modesty, and in his presence I should 
not feel free to sneak of him in this 
light); knowing him to some degree at 
least as I do, I thought I saw in such 
an expression as this a splendid tri- 
umph in his character, for he is not a 
man like our friends cut in alabaster; 
he is a man whose blood is warm with- 
in, filled with impulses, passions, strong 
in intent in his nature-, and after he 
had endured the most furious assault 
which had been made, carried on for 
months together, he could arise in pub- 
lic and speak with such meekness of 
spirit, I thought what a splendid vic- 
tory he has gained over himself. How 
blessed is he in being able to say, "Fa- 
ther, forgive them, they know not what 
they do," and he would not debase 
himself to answer back in the same an- 
gry spirit which characterized the as- 
sault made upon him. And then, as 
this is his experience, so it is the ex- 
perience of every Latter-day Saint, for 
we are one, and we- all have similar 
splendid opportunities of exhibiting 
these true marks of discipleship, for- 
giveness and charity. 

There is still another phase of this 
opposition which is developing quite a 
philosophy among us, the philosophy 
concerning opposition, for the. Book 
of Mormon has told us that there must 
be opposition in all things. We begin 
to appreciate the benefits of opposition. 
We now see that the curse that seem- 
ing curse, which was pronounced upon 
Father Adam and Mother Eve, was a 
blessing in disguise, and today the dis- 
guise is removed and we see it plain-

GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



ly. The. Lord, when He cast Adam 
and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, 
told them to subdue the earth and con- 
quer it, and have dominion. That was 
no curse. That was the greatest bless- 
ing which ever came, to the human race, 
when He told them to get to work, to 
conquer and subdue the earth, He 
showed them the pathway to dominion, 
to sovereignty, to power. What a splen- 
did journey mankind has traveled from 
that day to this! How the earth is 
his, and serves his purpose; how the 
beasts of the field and all the crea- 
tures of the earth are a service to man, 
because he has conquered the earth 
and made it his. So down through all 
the vicissitudes of human life, opposi- 
tion, resistance has been a cause of de- 
velopment in men of powers 
and faculties which they would 
not have known had it not 
been for this opposition. Does not the 
eagle dash his beak harshly on a rock 
before the Igneuman comes; but with 
the fight he takes on new life, increas- 
ed powers are developed, and he is 
made stronger and heroic for the vis- 
cissitudes through which he has passed. 
In national life the same principle 
holds. Where will you go for your 
ideals as American citizens, to wMch 
particular period will you appeal for 
the highest types of American citizen- 
ship, for the finest samples of patriot- 
ism? You will not go to the long period 
of prosperity. You will go back to the 
dark days, to the crisis in national his- 
tory to a Nathan Hale, or an Ethan 
Allen, who, when being led to the scaf- 
fold and asked if he had anything to 
say, his words were, "My only regret 
is that I have but one life to give to my 
country." You will go back to Wash- 
ington who, with his sons at Valley 
Forge, faced the thrills and difficulties 
of adverse wintry elements, scantily 
clad, foraging for food, but forced his 
way to victorious deliverance. You will 
go back to the critical period of Lincoln 
for another ideal. And so we must al- 
ways go to the dark hour, the day of 
adversity, to discover our real strength, 
and see the development of the highest 
principles and virtues within us. And 



with us as a people does not the same- 
principle hold? Since we have endured 
the hardships of expulsion from Mis- 
souri and Illinois we could be no more 
paralyzed or frightened by such things, 
because the work of God has triumph- 
ed over these things, and grown strong- 
er withal. In fact, I believe we may 
lay down as a fundamental principle in 
human experience, one which history 
will bear out satisfactorily, that men 
seldom do great things voluntarily, that 
the greatest achievements in the world 
have come out of necessity. Men do 
things because they have to; at least 
that has been our experience. Locally, 
what has been our history in this re- 
spect. We have spoken of the increased 
number, the increase of territory which 
is occupied by our people. We speak 
with pleasure and pride of the vase ex- 
panse of territory occupied by the Saints 
of God. We point to Mexico on the 
south and to Canada on the north, and 
the splendid stretch of land between 
that is more or less within the domain 
of Mormonism. How did we happen to 
acquire our foothold and standing in 
Mexico? Not because we wanted to, 
but because we were compelled to, be- 
cause things were uncomfortable in 
Utah, and we had to go to Mexico. How 
did we discover and acquire our foot- 
hold and promising commonwealths and 
prosperity in the Gem state on the 
north? Not because we wanted to go 
to Idaho, but because under peculiar 
existing circumstances we had to go to 
Idaho, and the same thing may be said 
of Canada as well. So that opposition 
and necessity have brought to us the 
greatest blessings we know; and if we 
ever move from here, in part or in 
whole, (I don't see how that will be) 
history suggests that we thereby might 
move another step forward because it 
will be conformable for us to do it. So 
that we have nothing to fear in oppo- 
sition, but we need to rejoice and be 
exceeding glad because of the blessings 
which come to us by reason thereof. 

I am reminded of the words of the 
Prophet Joseph, which let me read in 
conclusion, because they are a source of 
encouragement to me, and they will be

to all Latter-day Saints; and if he who 
had passed through the trying- ordeals 
that he experienced, if he could speak 
this way, surely we, seventy years later 
with all the splendid achievements 
passed before us, we may also echo his 
words. Said he: 

"No unhallowed hand can stop the 
work from progressing. Persecution 
may rage, mobs may combine, armies 
may assemble, calumny may vent her 
venom, but the truth will go forth, no- 
bly, boldly and independent, till it has 
penetrated every continent, visited ev- 
ery clime, swept every country, and 
sounded in every ear, till the purposes 
of God shall be accomplished and the 
great Jehovah shall say the work is 
done." Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

Arising to speak to you at this time 
puts me in mind of a story I read not 
long ago. It was during the late war, 
when some soldier* were around a 
camp fire, trying to keep themselves 
from freezing to death, a preacher 
came along to hold services. He looked 
around among the soldiers, and said, 
"I will take for my text Chilblains." 
So he instructed the soldiers what to 
do, which was to put soft soap in their 
shoes, place them on their feet and 
wait till their feet were healed, and 
then he would talk to them about the 
Lord the next time he came. You can't 
talk to people when they are uneasy, 
not if you are like I am. You can't 
preach to people when they want to 
go home. Now if any of you want to 
go, please go. and the rest of us will 
stay till we get through. 

I am not going to announce any 
blood and thunder doctrine to you to- 
day. I have not been radical for four 
long months, not since I had appendi- 
citis. I came very nearly being oper- 
ated upon. I tho"~M I was going to 
die for a few hours. People said to 
me, "Why, brother Kimball, you 
needn't be afraid, you'll get justice." 
"Well," I said, "that is what I am 
afraid of." Well now, the Latter-day 
Saints need not get frightened; they 
will get justice. You have been fed on 
6 



rich diet during this conference, and 
now I will give you a little coarse food 
to. help you out. 

I am not exercised about the tri- 
umph of this work. I air> not lying 1 
awake nights any more, wondering how 
the Lord is going to do it. Notwith- 
standing the fact that I am laboring 
in the Church, I don't know what the 
Lord wants in all things, if I did I 
would be willing to try and carry it 
out. The Lord's ways are not as man's 
ways, and He does thiners so differently 
from the way we want to do them that 
many of us are oftentimes surprised, 
and it requires constant faith to stay 
in this Church. I believe it is the 
hardest church to stay in that there is 
on earth, because you have always got 
to keep exercising faith. I remember 
hearing of a man that apostatized from 
the Church, and he was asked what 
was the matter. He said, "Well' I 
have got tired of exercising faith." 
That is true. Some people that called 
themselves Latter-day Saints would 
have destroyed this Church long ago 
if they had had the power, but they 
couldn't do it. I will tell you some- 
thing, brethren: Don't get too much 
exercised about the outside people. I 
feel a good deal, I think, like my father 
did one time when he was praying. 
You know he was rather peculiar, and 
prayed in his own way. He was pray- 
ing about some one, and he stopped in 
his prayer and laughed very heartily, 
and then said, "O Lord, forgive me, it 
makes me laugh to pray about some 
men." Now it makes me laugh some- 
times when I think about the puny ef- 
forts of men to destroy this work, how 
feeble they are, and how utterly they 
do fail. They can't hurt the work; it 
is absolutely impossible. I thank 
the Lord I have a testimony that 
this is the Joseph Smith Church, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I love the authorities of the 
Church; I tell you, though, the poorest 
way in the world to show that you love 
them is to be always talking about it. 
I will tell you how to prove you love 
the authorities of the Church; help 
them by working for the Church of Je-

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



sus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Work 
like Elder Ben E. Rich and others, who 
have been in the missionary field for 
seven years without any possible hope 
of remuneration as far as earthly things 
are concerned. All they get is bless- 
ings. That is the way to manifest love 
for this work. The Lord told my fa- 
ther, when He sent him off to preach 
the Gospel: "Trouble not thyself about 
thy family, for they are in my hands, 
and I will see that they have fathers 
and mothers, brethren and sisters and 
friends, and they shall not want for 
food or raiment, if you will preach 
my Gospel." Now if any of you love 
this work devotedly, go out in the 
world and preach it, there are many 
millions of people that have never 
heard the Gospel. 

I don't think we need spend very 
much time troubling over our enemies, 
and I don't believe in sticking pins in 
them. Take no more notice of them 
than you would of a fice dog. One time, 
in the south, it was my companion's 
turn to ask for entertainment, and he 
stood on a platform nearly as high as 
my head, and knocked on the door; 
just then one of those little fice dogs 
bounded out the doorway, ran right 
between my companion's legs and 
landed on top of my head. That is the 
only time I ever was frightened by a 
fice dog, and I never have been fright- 
ened since. 

I say, we need not be anxious about 
the triumph of this work; we need not 
be so exercised about it that we will 
lay awake nights. But I tell you, 
every man and woman in this church 
should be exercised and anxious about 
the salvation of the souls of the chil- 
dren of men, and about the preaching 
of this Gospel. Loot at our Savior, 
thing of the anxiety He had for the 
souls of men. Just think of 
the sleepless nights He must 
have spent. I can not be converted to 
the idea that ihe Savior sweat great 
drops of blood because they were going 
to crucify Him. But, He so loved the 
souls of the children of men. and His 
sorrow was so great for them that He 
sweat great drops of blood. Now you 



need to get a little bit anxious, and 
go home and get a little healthful ex- 
ercise, and not sleep too much; lie 
awake a little and think about this 
work. Now, I am not exercised about 
the sectarian ministers. I wish they 
would take a little fatherly advice from 
me, but they won't do it. But I wish 
they would take my advice, and stop 
making false charges against the 
Church authorities. Why don't they 
adopt the plan of the "Mormon" 
Church. Our Elders in California, in 
the Southern States, in the Eastern 
States, and all over the world, follow 
the instructions of the Prophet Joseph, 
a command in fact, that they should 
not tear down other churches. I con- 
fess I deserved a good licking quite a 
number of times in the south, it is so 
easy to tear down, and it is so difficult 
to build up. See what it has cost this 
Church; see the number of lives that 
have been lost in preaching the Gos- 
pel. See the hundreds of Elders that 
have been broken down in their consti- 
tutions, absolutely and utterly, in the 
Southern States. O. how I pity some 
of those Elders in the South, their 
blood is poisoned by malaria that 
nothing but the rower of God will ever 
heal them. Why. you don't realize 
what it costs_to build up this Church. 

I am proud of this work. I am 
proud of the authorities, and God be- 
ing my helper. I will show my integ- 
rity to them, by following their in- 
structions, and when they want me to 
go to work, to work I'll go. 

Now, brethren, the Lord bless you. 
You shouldn't get yourselves tied up 
by debt. Of these Seventies 
8,000 men . I am sorry there is 
not more than one out of a hundred 
that is prepared to go on a mission, be- 
cause of debt, or infirmities. When a 
man claims that he would lay down his 
life for this work, that he would place 
all that he has and all that the Lord 
has given him on the altar, and you in- 
vite him to go on a mission, you some- 
times find him full of sorrow, and trou- 
ble and in debt. It is the most inconsis- 
tent thing in the world. 

Now, brethren, the Seventies are not 



OUTDOOR 

all that way; among them are a lot of 
aged men, too old to go on missions, it 
is not wise they should. These old men 
ought to be ordained High Priests, and 
allowed to labor at home. And then 
there are a lot of physically disabled 
Seventies, good faithful men; but they 
are not suited for missionary work, 
they also ought to be ordained High 
Priests. And I pray God that we may 
in time have an army of Seventies like 
the soldiers of the government of the 
United States, young, able-bodied, qual- 
ified to go to the south and to the north 
and all over the world. We ought to have 
an army of men prepared to go out and 
preach the Gospel, so that these breth- 
ren, presidents of missions, can have 
efficient and capable men to assist 
them. 

I believe there was a time in the his- 
tory of this church when it was neces- 
sary to send all kinds of men! God 
magnified them, and made them mar- 
velous; but I tell you He does not look 
upon ignorance now with any degree of 
allowance. There is no need of our 
Pristhood being ignorant; there is no 
Tieed of our Priesthood going out as 
''the fishermen went out. They ought to 
go out well equipped and fitted for the 
work of the Lord as special witnesses 
i of Christ. I know what the Lord wants 
in this respect, just as well as if He 
gave me a direct revelation. When 
missionaries are wanted they should be 
found in the Seventies quorums instead 
of any other. The Lord bless you. 
Amen. 

The choir tendered the anthem, 
"Jubilate." 
Benediction by Elder T. A. Clawson. 

OUTDOOR flEETING. 

Hundreds who were unable to obtain 
admission to the Tabernacle or Assem- 
bly hall, congregated in front of the 
Bureau of Information building, and an 
•outdoor meeting was held there. Elder 
Benjamin F. Goddard presided. 

The congregation sang, "High on the 
mountain top." Elder Louis A. Kelsch 
offered prayer, after which the great 
throng joined in the hymn, "Now let us 
rejoice." 



MEETING. 83 

Elder J. G. McQuarrie, president of 
the Eastern States mission, was the 
first speaker introduced. He dwelt on 
the subject of "True Liberty," and 
showed by striking illustrations from 
both ancient and modern history that 
those whose ambitions led them to the 
worship of false gods were slaves to 
their unworthy ambitions. That the 
truest, safest, and only true liberty 
comes from obeying God's eternal laws. 
Those who acquire wealth and political 
power are never contented with it. The 
Gospel alone gives that peace of mind 
and contentedness, which Saints of God 
enjoy. We should seek first the king- 
dom of heaven and trust to the Lord 
to add the promised blessings. 

President Nephi Pratt of the North- . 
western States mission spoke on the 
restoration of the Gospel, and showed 
that there is but one Gospel, and that 
it is essentially and eternally unchange- 
able; hence the Gospel today must be 
the same as that which the Master es- 
tablished. He compared the principles 
taught by the former day Saints with 
those ennunciated by Latter-day Saints 
showing them to be the same. Also the 
organization of the primitive Church 
with that of Christ's church today was 
emphasized as to their similarity. Even 
the mode of preaching the Gospel is 
identical with that of early days, and 
the same bitterness towards the true 
followers of the lowly Nazarene is ever 
unchanged. The Gospel has been re- 
stored by an angel to Joseph Smith in 
fulfillment of ancient prophecy. 

President William H. Smart of the 
Wasatch stake spoke of the good work 
accomplished by the Bureau of Infor- 
mation. He told of a conversation he 
had with a broad-minded and intelli- 
gent tourist. The stranger had heard 
ridiculous and misleading reports about 
Utah and the "Mormons" but found 
them to be false and was happily as- 
tonished at the wonderful works ac- 
complished by the pioneers, and the 
splendid showing made by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in an educational and 
moral line. President Smart rejoiced 
that the "Mormons" are becoming bet- 
ter known and consequently better lik-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ed as a people. He bore a strong testi- 
mony that the Gospel has been restored 
in its originality with all its gifts and 
blessings. That the mission of the 
people of God is to declare the Gospel 
to all the world, to bring peace and love 
in place of strife and hatred, and to 
bless humanity both in temporal and 
spiritual ways. 

John W. Rigdon. son of Sidney Rig- 
don, was the closing speaker. He told 
of being baptized in 1839 by the Patri- 
arch Hyrum Smith, while the Prophet 
Joseph and his father stood on the 
banks of the Mississippi river, and be- 
held the ceremony. On account of his 
father going to Washington with the 
Prophet to present their grievances to 
the president of the United States, and 
not returning for a year, his confirma- 
tion had never taken place, and he did 
not become a member of the Church 
until one year ago, when he was bap- 
tized in New York. 

He said it had been claimed that 
Joseph Smith being an unlearned man, 
could not have written the Book of 
Mormon, but that his father was the 
real author of that book. Elder Rigdon 
denied most emphatically that his fath- 
er had written that sacred volume. 

After many years of practice as an 
attorney and without the slightest idea 
of ever becoming a "Mormon" he ques- 
tioned his aged father, who was then 
nigh unto death concerning the coming 
forth of the Book of Mormon. His 
father was emphatic in his claim that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, 
that an angel had delivered to the boy 
Prophet the Book of Mormon plates, 
and that, notwithstanding he felt he 
had been ill-treated by some Church 
leaders, he knew, nevertheless, that 
the work they represented was in very 
deed the Gospel of Christ. 

The speaker said that his father was 
present at the meeting held immediate- 
ly after the death of the Prophet, and 
that Brigham Young was the chosen 
successor of the martyred president. 

The congregation sang, "Our God, we 
raise to Thee, Thanks for Thy Blessings 
Free," after which the meeting ad- 
journed with benediction by Elder J. 
H. Felt. 



CLOSING SESSION. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

The choir sang the hymn: 

my Father. Thou that dwellest 
In the high and glorious place! 

"When shall I regain Thy presence, 
And again behold Thy face? 

Prayer was offered by Elder Charles 
D. Evans. 

A new hymn by Prof. Evan Stephens, 
entitled "True to the Faith," was ren- 
dered by the choir. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

I esteem it a very great privilege, my 
brethren and sisters, to be with you 
in this gathering this afternoon, and I 
also feel it a privilege to speak a few 
■words here by way of testimony in be- 
half of the wonderful work in which 
we are engaged. I have felt during 
the meetings of this conference much as 
the brethren who have addressed you 
have felt. All seem to have had a 
spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the 
light of the glorious Gospel, and all 
have been filled with a desire to bear 
testimony to the truth of the great 
work which the Lord has established. 

1 believe that the Latter-day Saints 
who have assembled together during 
this conference have felt in very deed, 
as suggested in the words of the open- 
ing prayer this afternoon, to glorify the 
Lord of heaven. There has been no 
spirit manifested that would indicate 
in the slightest degree that there was 
any lack of faith in the hearts of the 
brethren, or any lack of confidence as 
to the outcome of the work that our 
Father has established upon the earth. 
I do not suppose that any of those who 
have spoken understand in detail how 
God's work is to be wrousht out, or 
how it is to be made victorious, and 
overcome the opposition with which it 
will have to contend. We only know 
that the Lord of heaven has spoken; 
that He has revealed the authority of 
the Holy Priesthood; that He has made 
promises in connection with the powers 
of the Priesthood, and decreed the ul- 
timate triumph of the work which He 
has introduced. It certainly is a very 
great thing to be blessed with 
this spirit of confidence, and to» 



ELDER JOSEPH 

feel in one's soul that the work 
will be successful. As one of the speak- 
ers closed his remarks this morning, a 
brother patted the knee of his associ- 
ate and said, "We are going to win 
out." He felt so impressed by the re- 
marks that were made by Brother Ells- 
worth regarding the spirit, manifested 
by the people of the city of Nauvoo— 
people who had once looked with con- 
tempt upon the Latter-day Saints and 
■entirely misunderstod their motives, 
now were beginning to change their 
opinion, and to feel that there was a 
something about them that was most 
commendable and desirable. 

When we look back over the history 
of the people for the past 75 years we 
discover there has been a steady and 
wonderful growth. We realize that 
the promises that have been made, 
through the voice of inspiration and 
revelation, concerning the growth and 
development of the work of the Lord, 
have all been verified as far as we have 
advanced in our history. If some of 
the aged men and women who had part 
in this great work in the early days 
were to give their testimony, I imagine 
that that testimony would be to the ef- 
fect that the condition of the Latter- 
day Saints at the present time was be- 
yond what they anticipated in the in- 
ception of the work. In those days 
the lives of the leaders of the people 
were constantly sought. They were 
hounded from place to place, their 
homes were broken up time after time, 
and they were compelled to be almost 
constantly upon the move, seeking new 
locations where they might establish 
themselves. I very much doubt if those 
heroes and heroines of the past ever 
saw, while looking into the future, the 
mighty growth and strength of the peo- 
ple as we see it today. Surely the 
promises of the Lord have been mar- 
vellously fulfilled, and the efforts of 
those who have so strenuously sought 
the destruction of the Latter-day 
Saints have been brought to naught in 
a most wonderful way. Our course has 
been an upward course. We have been 
constantly advancing. In spite of the 



W. McMURRIN. 35 

misrepresentations so widely circulated 
regarding us, there are many thousands 
of people who are beginning to be ac- 
quainted with the Latter-day Saints. 
Many of those who journey through our 
country, and who come in contact with 
the people in their homes, go away im- 
pressed with the feeling that there is 
a power, a strength, a goodness, and a 
virtue, connected with the work of the 
Latter-day Saints that they little 
dreamed of. It is my faith that this 
growth will still continue, and that 
the promises made by our Father in 
heaven will be accomplished. I take a 
great deal of comfort in reading some 
of these promises, and I would like to 
read to this great congregation a few 
words of revelation given in the early 
days of the Church. It has been writ- 
ten in the Old Scriptures that where 
there is no vision the people perish.' 
When the Lord does not reveal 
His will to the inhabitants of the earth 
they are in a perishing condition. 

Our Father in heaven, because of the 
love He has for His creatures, has man- 
ifested His will in all ages of the world, 
and has spoken to the prophets. The 
testimony of the Holy Scriptures is, 
"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, 
but He revealeth His secrets to His 
servants the prophets." When we have 
a promise of this character, that has 
been given by the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost, we can understand and 
know that the great and marvelous 
work, spoken of by all the prophets, 
will not be accomplished without the 
Lord revealing to the prophets of the 
latter times, what He intends to do. 
Our Father has always raised up men 
and filled them with the power of the 
Holy Ghost, that they might commu- 
nicate His will to the people. As God 
in times past has looked in compassion 
upon mankind, and has raised up men 
who were filled with the Holy Ghost 
to deliver His words, so in these latter 
times He has manifested the same 
manner of love for His children here 
below, and He has declared: 

"Wherefore I the Lord, knowing the 
calamity which should come upon the 



gg GENERAL. < 

inhabitants of the earth, called upon 
my servant Joseph Smith, Jr., and 
spoke unto him from heaven and gave 
him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to 
others, that they should proclaim these 
things unto the world, and all this 
that it might be fulfilled, which was 
written by the prophets. 

"The weak things of the world shall 
come forth and break down the mighty 
and strong ones, that man should not 
counsel his fellow man, neither trust 
in the arm of flesh. 

"But that every man might speak in 
the name of God the Lord, even the 
Savior of the world; 

"That faith also might increase in 
the earth; 

"That mine everlasting covenant 
might be established; 

"That the fullness of my gospel might 
be proclaimed by the weak and the 
simple unto the ends of the world, and 
before kings and rulers." 

The reason the Lord called upon Jos- 
eph Smith was that all the children of 
men, the great and mighty as well as 
the humble, might have the truth of 
the everlasting Gospel proclaimed unto 
them, that through hearing the Gospel, 
through repenting of their sins and 
turning to the Lord of heaven, they 
might escape the judgments and cal- 
amities that are coming upon the in- 
habitants of the earth. The mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and his fel- 
low laborers is a mission of peace, glad 
tidings of good things, the preaching 
of the Gospel of the Redeemer of the 
world. There is no spirit in connec- 
tion with the preaching of this gospel 
that will do injury to any man that 
lives. The Lord has said: 

"And -again, the Elders, priests and 
teachers of this Church shall teach the 
principles of my gospel, which are in 
the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in 
the which is the fulness of the gospel; 

"And they shall observe the covenants 
and church articles to do them, and 
these shall be their teachings, as they 
shall be directed by the Spirit; 

"And the Spirit shall be given unto 
you by the prayer of faith, and if ye 
receive not the Spirit, ye shall not 
teach." 

The commandment that was given in 
the very beginning was that the Gos- 
pel should be preached by those who 



INFERENCE. 

were called and authorized, as it is 
contained in the Bible and in the Book 
of Mormon; and the men who were 
authorized to preach the Gospel and 
to call men to repentance have been 
commanded by the Lord that if they do 
not have the Spirit they shall not 
preach. It is evident from this great 
concourse of people, and the great 
gathering in the Assembly Hall, and 
the hundreds of thousands of Latter- 
day Saints who are not able to come 
unto this conference, that the Spirit 
of the living God has been upon those 
who have been crying repentance 
among the nations of the earth. It is 
also apparent that that same spirit has 
taken possession of the men and women 
who have hearkened to the testimonies 
of those who have been chosen and com- 
missioned of the Lord to cry repentance. 
A more stupenduous testimony concern- 
ing the power given to the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, and the Spirit of the Lord 
resting upon him and upon those who 
have been commissioned from that day 
to the present, could not be imagined 
than is witnessed in this great Taber- 
nacle this afternoon, and witnessed still 
more wonderfully in these mountain 
valleys from Canada to Mexico. God 
has taken possession of the hearts 
of the people in every land. He 
has drawn them together by the pow- 
er of the Holy Ghost, and He has re- 
vealed unto them the truth of the ever- 
lasting gospel. Men in the world im- 
agine that we are not free, that we are 
priest-ridden; but the truth is that 
by the power of the Holy Spirit men 
have been drawn from the east and 
from the west, from the north, and 
from the south, to this land of Zion. 
They have come here thirsting for the 
word of God, thirsting for information 
concerning the purposes of the Al- 
mighty, and their souls have been filled, 
they have been established in the truth, 
and they cannot be moved. This 
is empressed upon us by this gath- 
ering. It is still more evident from the 
mighty gathering of the Saints from the 
nations of the world. The predictions 
made by the prophets are surely be-

ing fulfilled when they declared that it 
should "come to pass in the last days 
that the mountain of the Lord's house 
should be established in the top of the 
mountains and many people should say: 
"Let us go up to the house of the God 
of Jacob, that we may learn more fully 
of His ways and walk more perfectly in 
His paths." If the prophets have writ- 
ten by the power of the Holy Ghost 
and their words are to be fulfilled, then 
there must transpire in the latter times 
just what has taken place since the 
commencement of the preaching of 
the Gospel introduced in this dispensa- 
tion by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Who 
is there in all the religious world to- 
day who believes in the fulfillment of 
these predictions of the prophets? Who 
is there calling the attention of the peo- 
ple to these great prophecies pertaining 
to the latter times? As far as I know, 
we are the only people who seem to 
understand these predictions, and the 
only ones who are laboring to accomp- 
lish them. AVe are the only people who 
are possessed of that power and spirit 
that was tc characterize God's work 
in the last dispensation. It was to be 
a marvelous work and a wonder. Sure- 
ly this work has been a marvel; in the 
eyes of the world it is a marvel today. 
We can rejoice when we look into the 
future and read of God's promise relat- 
ing thereto. This is the promise: 

"And the warning shall be unto all 
people by the mouths of my disciples 
whom I have chosen in these last days; 
and they shall go forth, and none shall 
stay them; for I, the Lord, have com- 
manded them." 

If this be a revelation from the Al- 
mighty, there is no power that can stay 
the preaching of the everlasting gospel, 
Of that can prevent God's servants from 
delivering the message that has been 
committed to the earth; not because of 
the might of the preachers of "Mor- 
monism," not because of the strength 
of the Latter-day Saints, but because 
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob 
has decreed that this warning voice 
shall be carried to all the inhabitants of 
the earth, and that none shall have 



the power to stay it. We believe in th-; 
power of our Father in heaven. We be- 
lieve His arm is not shortened. We be- 
hove that He can accomplish His de- 
crees. And .while we do not know 
what means He will use in the ac- 
complishment of His purposes, we do 
know within our souls that this prom- 
ise will be verified, that this Gospel will 
be preached in all the world, and that 
the hearts of honest men and women, 
and the hearts of wicked men and wom- 
en as well, will be pricked by the pow- 
er of God, their feelings softened, and 
they will be turned from darkness and 
error to the Lord of heaven, and from 
all the points of the compass, as has 
been the case in the past, so in the fu- 
ture, the Israel of God will be gathered, 
and His mighty purposes will be ac- 
complished. Well may our great choir 
sin t ?, and well may the preachers cry 
out. "Rouse, O ye mortals, and heark- 
en to the message of truth." May God 
help us to bear our responsibility well 
and faithfully, is my prayer through. 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

Restoration," sister Judith Anderson

PATRIARCH S. W. RICHARDS. 

My brethren, sisters and friends, 
quite unexpected to me prior to coming 
into this meeting, I have been request- 
ed to say a few words to you on some 
matters touching my history and ex- 
perience with the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I am thankful that I can say E 
was quite intimate with him while he 
was living upon the earth. There is a, 
little experience I had with him that 
perhaps no other person living today 
could relate. In the winter of 1843-4, 
about six months prior to the death of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, a messenger 
was sent to me from Nauvoo to ask me 
if I would be one of a company of pio- 
neers to explore the Rocky Mountains 
and to find a place for the Church to g» 
to. That request came from the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. At the time I thought 
it a little strange that I should be call- 
ed upon for a mission of this kind, as I

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



was but a young- man, in my teens; but 
my acquaintance up to that time with 
the Prophet Joseph was such that I 
could not say no. I replied, Yes; I will 
do anything that the Prophet Joseph 
wants me to do, that is in my power 
to do. Consequently I gave my name 
In to be one of a company of twenty- 
four young men. who were selected to 
travel and explore the Rocky Moun- 
tains and find a place for the Church to 
go to, because the persecution was get- 
ting so strong then in Nauvoo that the 
Prophet Joseph foresaw that the 
Church would have to leave, retire from 
the civilized world, and go into the 
mountains. This was then a wild coun- 
try. 

I am reminded that when I was in 
Europe, in the early fifties, it was re- 
ported to the British government that 
I was emigrating many people from 
Great Britain into a wild country, 
where they were liable to perish, and it 
was thought that this emigration ought 
to be stopped. Because of this I was 
ordered to appear in London and give 
an account of what I was doing. I 
was then presiding over the British 
mission, and emigrated many people 
to this country. I responded to this 
call, and spent about five hours before 
a committee of 16 members of Par- 
liament, telling them what I was do- 
ing. I had been to this valley myself 
and knew what it was. I told them 
that I was sending people to a country 
where they could own a farm and be as 
independent in their living as the lords 
and peers were there. I satisfied them, 
and they all shook hands with me at 
the end of our interview and wished me 
well, and I was invited by a num- 
ber of them to come again to London 
and spend some time with them. I 
speak of this to show that the feeling 
of the people at that time was that 
this was a wild country, and we were 
coming here to perish. 

It was the purpose of the Prophet 
Joseph to come here and locate with 
his people. He organized this company 
and held weekly meetings with them 
for several weeks in Nauvoo, and when 
he had them sufficiently instructed, as 



he thought, to properly understand 
what was to be the character of their 
mission and fit-out, he went across 
the river and made a start to go toward 
the mountains. It was his intention to 
go to the mountains with us, as a com- 
pany of pioneers. But he was followed 
by those that did not like the idea of 
his leaving, and while they were plead- 
ing with, him to return, he told them, 
"If I go back, I go as a lamb to the 
slaughter." Nevertheless, they deter- 
mined he should return, and he went 
back to Nauvoo. From there He went 
tc Carthage, and we all know the his- 
tory of what followed. , 

Suffice it to say, I attended four meet- 
ings of this company, and at one of 
them, which was in charge of Hyrum 
Smith, and three or four of the Twelve 
were also present, it was said that 
Joseph the Prophet had remarked that 
he wanted young men for that mission 
who could go upon the mountains and 
talk with God face to face, as Moses 
did upon Mount Sinai. When I heard 
that statement. I felt in my soul that 
I was not the one to go; and just be- 
fore the meeting closed I got up out 
of my seat for the purpose of going to 
Brother Hyrum Smith and telling him 
I was not the one to go. for I did not 
feel that I could meet the conditions, 
but as I got up there was a voice came 
to me, and I heard it distinctly as from 
one standing by my side, saying, "Stop; 
rest awhile." I took my seat again, 
and instead of telling the Prophet 
Hyrum that I did not feel I could go, 
I went home, and before retiring I 
knelt by my bedside and prayed to my 
heavenly Father. If I ever prayed in 
earnest, it was then, that I might know 
before morning whether I was a suit- 
able one to go on that expedition, un- 
der the terms specified. The idea of 
going into the mountains and talking 
with God face to face, as Moses did 
upon Mount Sinai, was more than I, as 
a boy, could think of encountering. 

No one perhaps need wonder that I 
should shrink from such a considera- 
tion. I retired to my bed and remained 
there about four hours, and during that 
four hours I got the answer to my pray- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

er, and when I awoke I was prepared 
to go upon that journey and do just as 
the Prophet wanted me to do. During 
that four hours I saw all that I ex- 
pect to see if I should live a thou- 
sand years. Someone came to me and 
told me where to go, and I performed 
that journey that night while I lay up- 
on my bed. I came to this valley first. 
I don't know how I got here, but I went 
down through these valleys and into 
Southern California. It had been stated 
that possibly we might have to go that 
far. When I came here 1 had to pass 
four sentinels, and in passing them I 
gave a countersign, which I got direct 
Irom heaven at the time it was needed. 
I passed them all, and went on down 
into Southern California. Then I was 
prompted to go farther, and I went into 
the northern part of Mexico. I returned 
from there to Jackson County, Missouri, 
and there I stayed and helped build the 
temple. I saw that temple thoroughly 
completed; in fact, I labored upon it 
until it was completed. When this was 
done, the vision continued, and I went 
and laid down my body in the ground, 
and my spirit left this tabernacle. Then 
I traversed this continent from end to 
-end. I saw the Garden of Eden as it 
was in the beginning and as it will be 
restored again. It was a land filled 
with verdure and vegetation, and with 
all manner of fruits, on which man was 
living. I saw it filled with cities, 
towns and villages, and people 
happy, living under the adminis- 
tration of divine providence. It was 
a Garden of Eden in very deed. 

Now, all this I saw while I was sleep- 
ing, and it was so impressed upon me 
that it can never be forgotten. I saw 
that this was the result of the Latter- 
day Saints coming to these valleys of 
the mountains and following the direc- 
tion that the Prophet Joseph indicated. 
I could tell a long story about this 
matter if I had the time to do it, but 
it is not best that I should. I wish, 
however, to make the statement dis- 
tainctly, that this coming to the moun- 
ains of the Saints of God and establish- 
ing themselves here was under the spe- 
cial direction of the Prophet Joseph 



Smith. Although there are those who 
say to the contrary, this is my testi- 
mony. The Prophet Joseph Smith had 
all this planned, and if he had been 
allowed to have had his way, I believe 
he might have been with us even to- 
day. 'He would certainly have gone 
with that company to these mountains 
and have located the people. I was one 
of that company, and I think I have 
the names of the rest. However, the 
conditions became so severe at Nauvoo 
that the people had to pick up and 
leave in a body, before there was time 
for this company to make the proposed 
exploration. .The Prophet Joseph and 
his brother Hyrum were martyred in 
Carthage, and the mob would not let 
the people remain in Nauvoo. 

These are the facts in regard to this 
matter, and I am proud and thankful 
that I know of these things, and am 
glad that the Saints are building up 
these valleys of the mountains as I saw 
them built up in vision. If the people 
of God will only go on and keep His 
commandments, the time will >come 
when this whole land will be filled with 
towns, cities and villages, and the earth 
will bring forth all that is necessary 
for the support and sustenance of the 
people thereof. Amen. 

A quartet selection. "One Hundred 
Tears," was sung by Lottie Owen, Ma- 
bel Cooper, George D. Pyper and Hor-

by Prof. Evan Stephens in commemora- 
tion of the birth of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and was splendidly rendered 
by these well known singers. 

BISHOP ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

The honor of addressing a general 
conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is one that 
I very much appreciate; though I feel 
somewhat strange in responding to the 
call that has been made upon me, re- 
alizing as I do that these are occasions 
when the people of God assemble for 
the purpose of listening to their lead- 
ers, and that it is more a time for ex- 
hortation and testimony than for doc- 
trinal discourses. Where the time is 
so limited, and the speakers are so 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



many, it is not to be expected that the 
privilege can be extended very far. 
Therefore it is not one that I have an- 
ticipated; at least I did not anticipate 
it until notified by President Smith that 
he intended to call me. And this is 
only one of many courtesies, many acts 
of kindness and consideration that I 
have received at his hands. 

The main reason, I presume, why he 
has asked me to speak, is because I 
happen to represent, in a way, one of 
the general institutions of the Church. 
Since the opening of the year 1899 I 
have been connected with the Church 
historian's office. While 1 have not 
been asked to make any report, I will 
say that that institution, during the 
period of which I am qualified to speak, 
has kept pace with the general progress 
of the Church. It is not my purpose to 
draw any invidious comparisons be- 
tween the present and the past. There 
is no need to do so. We all understand 
that the Lord's work is progressive, and 
that it was intended to be. It is no re- 
flection upon the past to say that the 
present overtops it, that we are in ad- 
vance today as a people over any for- 
mer period in our history. When I ex- 
press the belief that the Church of God, 
now presided over by President Jos- 
eph F. Smith, is in a better condition, 
spiritually and temporally, than ever 
before, I do not cast any reflection up- 
on the Prophet Joseph Smith, who 
founded the Church, nor upon President 
Brigham Young, his worthy and lawful 
successor, nor upon any of the servants 
of God who have in turn presided over 
this great latter-day work. It is sim- 
ply a recognition of the general princi- 
ple of progress, that is inherent in the 
work of God, and is among the things 
predestined. So, also, when I say that 
the Historian's office is in a better con- 
dition than it has ever been, I do not 
cast any reflection upon the faithful 
services of former historians. But it 
gives me pleasure to testify to the wis- 
dom, ability and energy manifested by 
President Anthon H. Lund, the present 
historian. He has watched over the in- 
stitution with all the care and anxiety 
of a father for his favorite child. He 



has given it what time he could spare 
from his duties, as one of the First 
Presidency. He has come early and 
remained late, and has put in more 
hours of willing and cheerful toil than 
any of his subordinates. I attribute 
much of the present good condition of 
the office to him and to those who have 
directed his labors. 

I wish I could say all that is in my 
heart to say. I wish I could utter the 
thoughts that arise in me as I gaze 
upon this great congregation. I see 
men and women from the north, from 
the south, from the east, and from the 
west, assembled here for the purpose 
of being instructed, counseled, strength- 
ened and renewed, that they may go- 
forth from this conference with the 
spirit of it upon them and within them, 
to carry the same to the remotest parts 
of the Church. While contemplating 
the scene I have mentally compared 
this multitude to the waters of the 
ocean, that are taken up into the clouds 
and sprinkled over the earth, to 
moisten and refresh the dry places; 
rivulets becoming streams, streams 
flowing into rivers, and the waters, 
through the rivers, finding their way 
back to the ocean. Why do they con- 
tinually thus return? Why this eternal 
round of renewal and progression? It 
is because it is necessary, in the pro- 
cesses of nature, in the great plan of 
God, that it should be so. that these 
waters, which become stagnant and 
turbid by remaining too long upon 
the surface of the earth, may be 
cleansed, revivified, and sent forth 
again over the face of the globe, to 
make it bloom with verdure and blos- 
som with beauty. As often as they 
are scattered, they are gathered again, 
to pass through the bosom of the "self- 
purifying, unpolluted sea." 

It seems to me that we can learn 
something from this lesson, written 
by the God of nature in the great book 
of nature. The Latter-day Saints are 
gathered together periodically in gen- 
eral conference. "My people shall meet 
tcgether often," the Lord says, to par- 
take of the sacrament, to receive in- 
struction, to be reminded of their du-

ties as Saints, and to have their 
spiritual strength renewed. When the 
call goes forth from the First Presi- 
dency, "Come to the general confer- 
ence," it is the duty of the Saints not 
only in Utah, but also in Idaho, Ari- 
zona, in Canada, in Mexico, and 
throughout the intervening region, to 
lay aside their everyday labors, and 
come, as many as possibly can, to these 
gatherings of God's people, where the 
stagnant waters of their souls may be 
purified and set in motion, where they 
may receive new strength, new energy, 
and go hence to moisten with the 
Spirit they here imbibe the dry and 
barren places; to stir up the people of 
Gcd, rouse the indifferent, reform the 
erring, and bless all with whom they 
come in contact, by imparting to them 
the good things they have here obtain- 
ed. "Freely ye have received, freely 
give.". 

What has been the purpose of the 
scattering and the gathering of the 
House of Israel? What is the sig- 
nificance of sending into the world a 
chosen race of spirits, called upon 
earth the children of Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, but known to us to have 
been the children of God before Abra- 
ham was born? They were chosen in 
the heavens, before they came in the 
flesh, and were sent forth from the 
presence cf God with a mission. We 
who call ourselves Latter-day S'aints 
are a branch of the house of Israel, 
gathered out from among the Gentiles; 
we are a portion of that martyred na- 
tion, chosen of God and sent upon 
earth to suffer and endure for His sake 
and for the sake of all mankind; to 
bear the oracles of God, and be His 
representatives in the midst of the hu- 
man race. Read what Moses says in 
the eighth verse of the 32nd chapter 
of Deuteronomy, if you doubt that 
Israel had an existence before the 
earthly days of Father Abraham. The 
passage runs as follows: 'When the 
Most High divided to the nations their 
inheritance, when he separated the 
sons of Adam, he set tiie bounds of the 
people according to the number of the 
children of Israel." This was before 



the birth of Abraham. The Lord had 
nations upon the earth before that 
time, and he set their bounds accord- 
ing to the number of the children of 
Israel . What does this mean, if not 
that Israel was a pre-existent race, or- 
dained before the world was to p*erform 
the great and important mission that 
has rested upon them all down the 
ages, and a portion of which is now 
being performed by the Latter-day 
Saints, the gathered children of Eph- 
ra im. 

If this be true of the whole house of 
Israel, how much more true of those 
mighty ones who have risen in the 
midst of the people of God, who have 
been called to be His prophets and 
apostles, His spiritual ministers to 
mankind? If it be true of the Latter- 
day Saints as a body, how much more 
true of those whom we sustain as our 
leaders? What should be our conduct 
towards them I know what the Pro- 
phet Joseph said: "Brethren, in all 
your kickings and flounderings, see to. 
it that you do not betray the servants 
of God; there is no sin that can be 
compared to it.' "Touch not mine an- 
ointed, do my prophets no harm,' 'is 
the warning word of the Lord that has 
ccme down through the centuries. A 
great lesson is taught, - one that all 
men would do well to heed, in the 
Savior's description of the last judg- 
ment: 

"When the Son of man shall come in- 
his glory, and all the holy angels with 
him, then shall He sit upon the throne 
of his glory: 

"And before him shall be gathered all 
nations: and he shall separate them 
one from another, as a shepherd divid- 
eth his sheep from the goats: 

And he shall set the sheep on his 
right hand, but the goats on the left. 

"Then shall the King say unto them 
on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of 
my Father, inherit the kingdom pre- 
pared for you from the foundation of 
the world: 

"For I was an hungered and ye gave 
me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me 
drink: I was a stranger, and ye took 
me in: 

"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was 
sick, and ye visited me: I was in pris- 
on, and ye came unto me. 

'"Then shall the righteous answer 
him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an

hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and 
gave thee drink? 

"When saw we thee a stranger, and 
took thee in? or naked, and clothed 
thee? 

"Or when saw we thee sick, or in 
prison, and came unto thee? 

"And the King shall answer and say 
tinto them, Verily I say unto you, In- 
asmuch as ye have done it unto one of 
the least of these, my brethren, ye have 
done it unto me. 

"Then shall he say also unto them 
on the left hand, Depart from me, ye 
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared 
for the devil and his angels: 

"For I was an hungered, and ye gave 
me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye 
gave me no drink: 

"I was a stranger, and ye took me 
not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: 
sick, and in prison, and ye visited me 
not. 

"Then shall they also answer him. 
saying, Lord,- when saw we thee an 
hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or 
naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not 
minister unto thee? 

"Then shall he answer them, saying, 
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye 
did it not to one of the least of these, 
ye did it not to me. 

"And these shall go away into ever- 
lasting punishment: but the righteous 
into life eternal"— Matthew 25: 31-46. 

I learn from these solemn words that 
God will judge the world by this stand- 
ard: "How have you treated my ser- 
vants?" I say it to the friends of these 
men who sit upon this stand, and I say 
it to their foes: How will you stand 
the issue when this test is applied, In- 
asmuch as ye did it, or did it not, unto 
these my servants, ye did it, or did it 
not, unto me? 

I bear my testimony that these are 
indeed the servants of God. I do not 
need to laud the virtues of President 
Joseph F. Smith; that has been well 
done already. But I can say Amen to 
all that has been said. He knows what 
I think of him. He knows that I love 
and honor him and he knows too, I 
trust, that I do not love and honor 
him simply because he has been good 
and kind to me. I love and honor him 
because God loves and honors him. I 
hold it to be my duty to sustain any 
man whom God has chosen to fill any 
position in His Church, whether that 
man loves me or loves me not. That 
has nothing to do with the principle in- 
volved. I must be loyal, independently 



of anyone 's feelings toward me. Doctor 
Bernhisel was a great friend of the 
Prophet Joseph. He lived with him in 
the Mansion House at Nauvoo, and 
whenever the Prophet came into the 
dining room, if the doctor was there 
first, he would arise and remain stand- 
ing until the Prophet had taken his 
seat. Joseph asked him why he did 
this, for he sometimes felt embarrassed 
by it. The answer was immortal: 
"Brother Joseph, I love to honor the 
man whom God has honored." That is 
the principle upon which we should 
love these men who stand at our head — 
because God has honored them, and 
they are His servants. It does not 
matter whether they love us or not 
(though I believe they do); they are 
the Lord's servants, and it is our duty 
to stand by them, to defend them, and 
to lay down our lives for them if nec- 
essary. 

I have a testimony that President Jo- 
seph F. Smith is the right man in the 
right place; and this not because he is 
the nephew of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, or the son of the martyred Hy- 
rum Smith. It is in his own right that 
he presides over this people. He is 
God's man, and has been chosen upon 
his own merits to hold this exalted po- 
sition. That is my conviction; and the 
same with regard to his Counselors, and 
the Twelve Apostles, and all the leaders 
of the Church. No mistakes are ever 
made in the selection of such men. 
When the servants of Go I, filled with 
the Holy Gkost, nominate a man, and 
the Holy Ghost in the hearts of the peo- 
ple testifies that that is the choice or 
God, it is His choice. It is impossible 
for a mistake to be made. Every man 
that has been called to preside over 
this- Church, or to stand among the 
leaders thereof, has been pointed out by 
the finger of God. There was no pos- 
sibility of a mistake, for the Spirit of 
Truth does not lie. These men come ti> 
the earth with the mission upon them 
to be prophets, apostles, ministers of 
life and salvation. They were chosen 
before the world was to hold these posi- 
tions; and they were eligible for thes> 
offices; it does not matter what their 
names are here. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

I believe with all my heart that when 
men are chosen to be servants of God, 
it is because of their own worth and 
integrity, and not because of their 
names and connections. I remember 
hearing a brother say that he thought 
his promotion in the Church was due to 
the fact that his father, or grandfather, 
who had passed behind the veil, had ex- 
erted an influence for him .there. That 
may be. but I do not believe it was 
the main reason. The teachings of the 
Prophet Alma, in the Book of Mormon, 
give the real reason why men are chos- 
en to bear the Holy Priesthood. They 
were ordained, he soys, to these sacred 
offices and callings, by the Lord God, 
"that thereby the people might know 
in what manner to look forward to his 
Son for redemption. And this is the 
manner after which they were or- 
dained: being called and prepared from 
the foundation of the world, according 
to the foreknowledge of God, on account 
of their exceeding faith and good 
works; in the first place being left to 
choose good or evil; therefore they, 
having chosen good, and exercising ex- 
ceeding great faith, are called with a 
holy calling." That, I believe, is the 
principle upon which these men were 
chosen. They came into the world with 
the ordination of God upon their heads; 
and there are others who have been 
ordained in like manner. High Priests 
after the Order of Melchisedek, though 
it may never be. theirs to sit among 
the leaders of Israel. But they are 
numbered with those whose mission it is 
to follow the Lamb wheresoever He 
goeth, and they are here to help prepare 
the way before the glorious coming of 
the Son of God. 

It is said that without the Melchise- 
dek Priesthood no man can look upon 
the face of God and live. And yet, Jo- 
seph Smith, when a boy of fourteen 
years, gazed upon the Father and the 
Son, and it was nine years before he 
held the Priesthood in the flesh. I once 
asked President Lorenzo Snow concern- 
ing this matter: "Why is it, if a man 
without the Melchisedek Priesthood 
cannot look upon God's face and live, 
that Joseph Smith could see the Father 
and the Son, and live, when he held no 



priesthood at all?" President Snow re- 
plied: "Joseph did hold the priesthood; 
he came with it into the world." I be- 
lieved it before he said it, but I wanted 
him to say it first. Joseph Smith, as- 
much as any Prophet that ever lived, 
was ordained a prophet before he cam? 
into this mortal life. He held the Mel- 
chisedek priesthood in the spirit, when 
he came here, or he could never hav? 
received what he did from God. And 
these men who have followed in hi& 
footsteps are spirits of the same class. 
The Prophet Joseph declared that every 
man who has a calling to minister to 
the inhabitants of this earth, was or- 
dained to that very purpose before the 
world was. 

Then I ask you again, brethren and 
sisters, can you afford to treat lightly 
these men, these representatives of 
God, these ambassadors from the courts 
of heaven? And I say to those who are 
attacking them and assailing them, In 
what plight will you stand, at the day 
of judgment, when it is said unto you, 
Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of 
these, my servants, ye did it unto me? 
Amen.

and Him obey. No matter what the 



world thinks or anybody says, let us do 
our duty; and in the language of Josh- 
ua let us sav, "as tor me and my 
house, we will serve tiod." Let this be 
the sentiment oi every heart repre- 
sented at this vast conference. 

In behalf of you who are assembled 
here, my brethren ana sisters, i desire 
to extend thanks and gratitude to Evan 
Stephens — a man gifted of God, tal- 
ented m music, in poetry and m song, 
and above and oeyonu an mat, a man 
gifted with humility and with faith in 
the Gospel of Jesus jurist; who is not 
only diligent in nis labors here with

in his soul to the cause of 
Zion. He bears testimony to tne truth 
in song and praise. ± -want to say, in 
behalf of this vast assembly, Brother 
Evan Stephens, vjod bless you and keep

this great choir. And then, in behalf 
of this congregation, too, 1 extend our 
appreciation and our gratitude to 
Brother John j. lVlcCielian, and his as- 
sistants. We thank God that He has 
given us boys and girls, born and rear- 
ed in our midst, mat possess talent 
equal to that posses&eu oy any men or 
women born in the world. We will not 
admit that they are second to any. I 
thank God also, in your behalf, for 
this choir, wno have devoted hours, 
days, weeks and months, aye, and 
years, in the service or tne people; who 
have won a name mat is enviable, not 
only among the Latter-day Saints and 
the people of Utah, but a name that has 
extended beyond our borders to the 
uttermost parts of the earth. God 
bless you [speamng to the choir], you 
men and boys ot Israel and you daugh- 
ters of Zion. Peace be unto you. May 
your voices ever ring clear auu true in

cious voices and has put it into your 
hearts to labor in tne capacity of a 
choir for the benefit of Zion. The Lord 
bless you, and. He will bless you; and in 
the name of Israel's uoa, as a ser- 
vant of the Lord, I bless you. 

Again, in my own benalf, and in be- 
half of my counselors, President "Win- 
der and President Lund, I want to 
thank these my fellow-servants in the 
Apostleship. They are true men. They 
are honest men. They are God's ser- 
vants, and I know it. I am intimate 
with them, I live witn mem, I labor 
with them, and I know their hearts and 
their works. Their lives are open un- 
to me, and unto tlie living God; they 
are true men, and i bless them. God 
bless these my brethren. They are true 
to the Father, and 1 know that so long 
as they are true to Him they will be 
true to all the interests or His peo 
pie, and true to His servants, and no 
power can turn them from aod's cause. 

God bless and preserve m> Drother, 
the Presiding Patriarch of the Church. 
May the Lord lend unto Him the en- 
lightening, invigorating power of the 
Holy Ghost, that in His administrations 
as a Patriarch to the peopi c he may 
speak the truth, and only tne truth, 
and that his words may be words of 
soberness and knowledge, \vords of 
comfort and consolation to tnose on 
whom he lays his hands, tnai they may 
go away from his administration 
blessed in very deed. 

I want to bless some of my veteran 
friends who are nere. j. say, God 
bless you, brethren. You and I have 
grown grey in the cause or ziion. You 
have ever been on tne iron tiers of dan- 
ger, as protectors of the rights of the 
people and as protectors or the ser- 
vants of the Lord trom those who 
would injure and do them harm. I say, 
God bless you, and He will biess you, 
and I bless you in the name of Israel's 
God. 

Let the Lord God have mercy upon 
those, that seek to nurt the cause of 
Zion. O God, pity the misguided, the 
erring, the foolish, tne unwise. Put 
Thy Spirit in their hearts, turn them 
from the error of their ways and from 



their follies, and bring tnem back into 
the way of righteousness and into Thy 
favor. I ask mercy lor my enemies — 
those that lie about me and slander me, 
and that speak ali maner of evil gainst 
me falsely. In return, a beseech God 
my Heavenly Fatlier to nave mercy 
upon them; for those who do it not 
knowing what tney are doing are only 
misguided, and those who are doing 
it with their eyes open certainly need, 
most of all, the mercy, compassion and 
pity of God. May God pity them. 
May He have mercy upon them. I 
would not harm nair of their head, 
for all I am worth m the world. I 
would not throw a block in tneir way 
to prosperity. Nc; and I beseech my 
brethren that they keep hands off the 
enemies of our people and those who 
are paving their own road to destruc- 
tion and will not repent, who are sin- 
ning with their eyes open, who know 
that they are transgressing tne laws 
of God and villifying and lying against 
the servants of the Lord. Have mercy 
upon them. Do not touch them; for 
that is just what they would like. Let 
them alone. Let them go. Give them 
the liberty of speech tnty want. Let 
them tell their own story, and write 
their own doom. We can afford it. 
They do not hurt us, and if it affords 
them any amusement, I am sure they 
are welcome to it. 

I feel like blessing the quorums of 
the Priesthood, every one of them, from 
the High Priests to the Deacons. I 
pray God, my Heavenly Father to re- 
member them in their organizations, 
to help them, that they may magnify 
the Priesthood they hold and do the will 
of the Father; that the Seventies may 
be minute men, instant in season and 
out of season, ready and willing to re- 
spond to the calls that are made upon 
them to go and preach the Gospel to 
the world. Gather in irom the Elders 
quorums those who have proven them- 
selves, worthy and who nave gained ex- 
perience, and make Seventies of them, 
so that the quorum of the Seventies 
may be replenished; and the aged ones, 
whose physical condition will not per- 
mit them any longer to do missionary

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



duty in the world, let them be ordained 
High Priests and Patriarchs, to bless 
the people and to minister at home. 
Gather in the strong, the vigorous, tne 
young, the able-bodied, who have the 
spirit of the Gospel in their Hearts, to 
fill ud the ranks of the Seventies, that 
we may have ministers to preacn the 
Gospel to the world. They are needed. 
We cannot now meet the demand. 

I feel like blessing the auxiliary or- 
ganizations, which are so powerful in 
wielding influences for good among the 
youth of Zion. May the Lord bless 
them, one and all, and make them to 
continue to be useful in their callings, 
that they may be abie to magnify them 
in honor before God in all the world. 
Peace be unto those that preside in all 
these organizations, that they may be 
equal to the duties tnat devolve upon 
them. 



God bless you all. xvlay peace 
abound with you. Let this assembly 
of His people come up as a witness unto 
God and unto the world tnat "Mor- 
monism" is a living, moving entity; 
that it is not dead nor sleeping, but 
that it is alive and awake, growing and 
advancing in the land; and let the world 
know it. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "When 
Thou Comest to the Judgment," Sister 
Lizzie T. Edward rendering the solo- 
parts beautifully. 

Benediction was pronounced by Presi- 
dent John R. Winder. 

The conference adjourned for six 
months. 

The stenographic report of these pro- 
ceedings was taken by Elders Arthur 
Winter and F. E. Barker.

and called upon Elder Horace S. En- 
sign, late president of the Japanese 
mission, ta give the meeting an idea of 
the condition of the Sunday schools in 
that land. 



ELDER HORACE S. ENSIGN. 

My brethren and sisters, I am indeed 
greatly surprised in being called to oc- 
cupy this position tonight. I rejoice, 
however, in being present to associate 
with you in this Sunday School confer- 
ence. It has been more than four years 
since I enjoyed this privilege, and I 
assure you that I appreciate it. 

Two years ago the 29th of last No- 
vember, the first Sunday school of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints was organized in Tokio, Japan. 
Previous to that time the Elders had 
been laboring among the adults, endea- 
voring to teach them the plan of life 
and salvation as it has come to us in 
this day and dispensation. As you are 
all aware, we were compelled to labor 
among those who know not God, and 
who have no conception of the mission 
of our Lord Jesus Christ. We found 
that our labors were not altogether a 
success among the adults of Japan. 
We discovered that they had bowed so 
long before graven images that they 
had become absorbed in the supersti- 
tions of Buddha and Shinto, and the 
pure light of the Gospel had but little 
effect upon them. Realizing these con- 
ditions, the Elders laboring in Japan 
made it a matter of fasting and prayer 
before the Lord, imploring Him to 
give them light and inspiration with re- 
gard to the dissemination of the Gos- 
pel in that foreign land. The inspira-- 
ticn of the Lord unto His servants 
was, that we should organize Sunday 
Schools, that we should invite the child- 
ren to come to our home and to the 



98 



DE3ERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



homes where the Elders were residing, 
that we might teach them in their early 
lives the plan of salvation, teach them 
the beautiful story of the life of Christ, 
and of the restoration of the Gospel in 
this day and dispensation. 

It pleases me to be able to say that 
God has magnified His servants in their 
work with the children. At our first 
Sunday school in the city of Tokio we 
had more than 90 children present. 
Many of them came out of mere curi- 
osity; some of them because they were 
sent by their parents: and I am happy 
to say that many of them have contin- 
ued to come, and have learned much 
with regard to the mission of the Lord 
Jesus. Immediately surrounding our 
headquarters, we found many families 
in which were a number of children, 
and from those families we have re- 
ceived the greatest support in our Sab- 
bath school. We realized that it would 
be impossible for us to entertain the 
children by telling them. over and over 
again the life and mission of Christ, so 
we found it necessary to begin the 
translation of our Sunday school hymns 
and to set music to the translations. 
This, too, was an inspiration from our 
Heavenly Father, and it has proved 
very effectual. In the Yotsuya district 
of Tokio, where the Latter-day Saints' 
headquarters is located, we hear almost 
every day our Sunday school songs be- 
ing sung in the street by our Sunday 
School children. 

The children love to come to our 
headquarters to be taught the songs 
which have been arranged for them, 
and we find in going to their hom^s 
that their parents are happy indeed 
that the Latter-day Saints have organ- 
ized a Sunday school in their midst. 

And thus it is that one of the greatest 
joys that the children have is to attend 
their Sunday school, every Sabbath 
morning and be taught the stories 
with regard to the life and mission of 
Jesus Christ. Not only do they love to 
hear these stories, not only do they 
enjoy relating them as best they can to 
their parents, but they do take delight 
in singing our songs. And you, my 
brethren and sisters, would rejoice 



could you hear their little voices raised 
in singing the songs of Zion as they 
have been translated into the Japanese 
tongue. At headquarters we have a 
large swing, and the little children come 
there to play, and as they swing 
through the air we hear them singing 
our little Sunday school songs, and they 
,do sing them with spirit, just as our 
children sing them here at home. And 
we know that much good will be the re- 
sult of our work with the children. 

The Japanese themselves are not of a 
spiritual nature. They are materialists. 
"We have discovered in talking •with 
them, that if we can show them where 
they can benefit themselves materially 
by accepting the Gospel they will listen 
with interest to our story; but when 
they learn that the only benefit derived 
from the acceptance of the Gospel is a 
spiritual blessing, then they have but 
little to say, and manifest but little in- 
terest in that which we endeavor to 
teach them. But we do have faith in 
the youth of Japan, and I feel sure 
that our efforts with the children will 
.eventusJly result in good, that we 
shall see many in the land of Japan 
strong and stalwart in the faith, who 
have been taught the Gospel In the 
Sabbath schools. 

My brethren and sisters, the Elders 
in Japan are doing grand work, espe- 
cially among the children. I received 
a letter a short time ago from the El- 
ders laboring there now. Two Elders 
had gone into a new district, and as 
soon as they found quarters, they went 
among the people and invited them to 
send their children to the home where 
the Elders were living. They did so. 
The last report that 1 heard was that 
they were having now an attendance of 
S3 children at their Sabbath school 
every Sunday morning, and the Elders 
have been instructed to organize Sun- 
day schools in all parts of Japan where 
they are laboring; to let this be their 
first thought, because we feel that we 
shall be able to impress the young 
minds, while we find that it is almost 
an impossibility to impress the minds 
of the older people. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having the 
privilege of being with you tonight, and 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

I rejoice in being associated with you 
in the Sabbath school, I sincerely pray 
that God will bless the officers of th-.? 
Sabbath school, that He will bless the 
teachers who are teaching the youth 
of Zion. And I ask you to remember 
the Elders away in Japan endeavoring 
to teach that people the Gospel of lif.; 
and salvation. God is remembering 
them and sustaining them, and I know 
it is in accordance with your faith and 
your prayers. The Elders have been 
wonderfully blessed in acquiring the 
language. Most of them speak it flu- 
ently, and it has been through the grace 
of God unto them. The natives tell us 
that our Elders, who have been there 
only a little more than four years, speak 
with greater freedom and greater fluen- 
cy than missionaries of other denomin- 
ations and others who have been there 
for 20 years. So you see that they are 
enjoying the gifts of the Gospel, and 
that God is sustaining them in theii- 
work there. 

May God bless us in our work, I ask 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL E. WOOLLEY. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice to- 
night to meet in this capacity and to re- 
port the Sabbath Schools of the Ha- 
waiian Mission. According to our re- 
port we lead in Sabbath School work 
in the Missions outside of Zion. We 
have more engaged and more schools 
than any other Mission on the earth. 
We have sixty-five schools, organized 
with superintendents, with their as- 
sistants, secretaries and treasurers, to- 
gether with their aids; and we have 
over 2,700 members of the Sabbath 
Schools. The children of that land re- 
joice in singing the songs of Zion, and 
the most of them sing in the English 
tongue, and we feel that the Sunday 
School work is growing in that land, 
and we are proud that we stand in the 
lead. It is true the gospel has been 
preached in that land for fifty-five 
years, and Sunday Schools have been 
organized for many, many years, but 
the work is growing there. And the 
Sunday Schools send greetings to the 
Sunday Schools in Zion and especially 



to the General Superintendent, even 
President Joseph F. 'Smith, for the peo- 
ple look upon him as their father, he 
having labored among them so many 
years. The work in the Mission is pros- 
pering and we are adding to the Church 
each year. We now have upwards of 
7,000 souls, and, as I said r we are still 
gathering into the fold, and we feel 
that we have not laborers enough for 
the harvest. We are now a part of the 
United States, and we feel quite at 
home. We used to think that the Sand- 
wich Islands were almost out of the 
world, but today we hear, twice a day, 
all the important events of the globe, 
as we are now connected by cable. The 
work of the Lord is growing and in- 
creasing in that land and we rejoice in 
it. We rejoice in the Sabbath School 
work, especially, for we are trying to 
teach the young people as well as the 
older ones (for we have many 
aged ones who belong to the schools) 
the principles of the gospel, the plan o£ 
life and salvation; and I pray that the 
blessings of the Lord may be upon that 
nation, upon the Sunday Schools on 
tho.se islands, together with all other 
lands wheresoever the gospel is being 
preached. May the Lord help us who 
are engaged in this work, both at home 
and abroad, that we may be true to the 
covenants that we have made with our 
Father and with one another, and that 
the Sunday Schools may grow and in- 
crease, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM HANSON. 

We have nineteen Sabbath Schools in 
the Summit Stake of Zion, scattered 
along the banks of the Weber and 
Provo Rivers. We have an enrollment 
of about 2,300, 250 officers and teachers, 
that we think are about as good as 
any of the children of the Lord engag- 
ed in the Sabbath School work. We 
have nearly completed holding our lo- 
cal ward Sunday School conferences. At 
each of these conferences we take an 
opportunity to meet with the local offi- 
cers and the teachers of the respective 
schools and to question them as to how 
they are living, if they are living in

harmony with the requirements that 
were made of them when they accepted 
the office of Sunday School workers. In 
almost every instance we have been 
very glad to learn that nearly every 
hand is raised, and nearly every voice 
is prepared to say that they keep the 
Word of Wisdom, they all pay their 
tithes, are observing the Sabbath day 
and are living up to the requirements 
that have been asked of them by our 
worthy Stake President and his asso- 
ciates. We have the assistance of many 
other associations in our Stake. We are 
probably more closely connected than 
almost any other Stake. We all meet 
once a month in what is known as our 
auxiliary meetings. At these meetings 
the parents meet with every associa- 
tion, and their children can also join 
and meet at one place in the Stake, 
where they can all go to their different 
departments and there be instructed 
along the lines that have been laid out 
for them. 

We have very good Sunday Schools as 
a whole, and we are very pleased with 
them. We often have to drive quite a 
distance, sometimes thirty or thirty- 
seven miles, to be in attendance at the 
9:45 prayer meeting. This is quite a 
task, as most of us are engaged in bus- 
iness at home, and cannot leave before 
Sunday morning. There are only one 
or two schools that we can visit by the 
railroad, most of it has to be done by 
team, and we travel on an average of 
between five and six hundred miles 
each month in our Stake visits. 

I desire to say that the young people 
in the Summit Stake of Zion are doing, 
I believe, the very best that they can. 
We have all classes. We have a very 
healthy Sunday School In Park City, a 
mining camp; and in that school es- 
pecially there is great energy manifest- 
ed in trying to get the visiting breth- 
ren who come into that camp interest- 
ed in the Sabbath School, until now it 
has become so popular that the build- 
ing is scarcely able to hold them. 

I pray God to add His blessings to 
our work, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation then sang, "Hope 
of Israel." 



SCHOOL UNION. 

ELDER GEORGE M. CANNON. 
My brethren and sisters, I desire that 
while I speak to you I may be guided 
by the Spirit of the Lord in that which 
I say. I have ever had in my heart a 
desire to not say anything at any time 
that would bei contrary to the Spirit of 
the Lord; and I have no desire to speak 
sentiments that are not pleasing unto^ 
our Heavenly Father; nor do I desire to 
give voice to any sentiment in which I 
myself do not sincerely believe. I feel 
that one of the greatest duties that we 
have as Sunday school workers is to let 
our lives be of such a character that 
our deeds and our acts will speak more 
loudly than our words. I am an em- 
phatic believer in the fact that we can- 
not teach by word if our actions do not 
conform to that which we preach. I 
believe that Sunday school teachers and 
officers should set such an example be- 
fore their pupils that they will not be 
ashamed of their lives— that they will 
not be ashamed to have their children 
know that which they have done. 

I remember a few years ago attend- 
ing a missionary farewell, and the oc- 
casion was that of the departure of the 
first son of a man upon a mission. He 
was not the brother's oldest son, but he 
was the first son to be called upon a 
mission; and his father, speaking to 
that assembly, said: "My son will 
probably go into my old missionary 
field: he will visit the people whom I 
visited twenty years ago, but I feel Iti 
my heart I have no fear that wherever 
he goes he will find anything that will 
cause the blush of shame to come to 
his cheek. I am not afraid to have 
him go to the' people whom I have vis- 
ited. I am not afraid to have him 
tread in the paths in which I walked, 
and I am satisfied that there he will 
find that I have left behind me a rec- 
ord of which I need not be ashamed." 

I thought this was a glorious testi- 
mony; and I feel, in my own heart, that 
if everv one of us could say the same 
to our sons and daughters that we are 
not ashamed to have them go into the 
fields in which we have walked, meet 
the people among whom we labored, 
and listen to their testimony of that 



UESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

which we did — if we could live in such 
a way that we could say this to them, 
and say it truthfully, we need not be 
afraid to go back into the presence of 
our Eternal Father. Little children 
are keen observers of that which we 
do, and while they may not say, with 
a great writer, they feel the sentiment 
which he expressed when he said, "How 
can' I hear your words when your deeds 
speak a different language?" 

In my visits among the people, I have 
occasionally found some who have been 
disturbed a little by the comments of 
those who are not favorable to the 
work of the Lord, and have occasionally 
found some who were a little bit afraid 
that the Latter-day Saints are failing 
to an extent in their mission. I want 
to say to all such, that you are the ones 
who should be careful, that you may 
not be led astray by that which the 
enemies of the truth are seeking to 
circulate concerning our people. You 
know that we are told that if we sav 
the truth about our leaders, that we are 
simply seeking to flatter them, that we 
are seeking to build ourselves up in 
their estimation. In my own heart I 
have the utmost contempt for a man 
who, in order to build himself up, will 
flatter any other individual. While I 
feel they are worthy only of contempt, 
because they themselves are of such a 
caliber that they will not amount to 
much, yet while I feel that this is true, 
there is another thing that is equally 
true, and which other people should re- 
member, a*nd that is, that there are 
those who wilfully bear false witness 
against their neighbors, who wilfully 
disseminate doctrines which they know 
to be untrue. 

We find that in any conflict that takes 
place, the shafts of the enemy are di- 
rected at the leaders of any great 
cause. Those who follow are of com- 
paratively small importance, and the 
aim of the enemy is always to cripple 
those who lead. It is their aim, if 
possible, to weaken the confidence of 
their followers in them; and that is the 
aim of the opposers of the work of God 
today. They seek to lead away the 
people and weaken their confidence in 



those whom God has placed at their 
head, but I am glad to know that their 
efforts in this respect signally fail. I 
am glad to know that they cannot take 
from the people of God the confidence 
which they have in those whom God 
has placed to lead them; and I feel that 
one thing we should do, as parents and 
as teachers and officers of the Sabbath 
school, is to teach our little children 
to pray for all those who are engaged 
in the work of the Lord. 

I have no fear in my heart of a child 
being led away who is taught in his in- 
fancy to pray for the missionaries, that 
they may be able to reach the honest in 
heart, and that they may be preserved 
and brought home in safety and in pur- 
ity, and who is also taught to pray for 
those who are placed in authority in 
our midst, for the Bishop in the ward, 
for his father and his mother, for the 
presiding authorities; and I am satis- 
fied that those who are taught in this 
way will grow up with the Spirit of the 
Lord in their hearts, and that they can- 
not be led astray by that which the 
enemy may say about us. 

I have a testimony in my own heart 
of the truth of the Gospel, and it has 
been my fortune to know many. of those 
who presided over us as Presidents of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. As a boy I knew President 
Brigham Young, but only as a child 
would know one whom he would see 
upon the stand. But as I grew older I 
was brought into close contact with 
those who succeeded President Brig- 
ham Young. I was a teacher upon the 
block upon which President John Tay- 
lor lived, and visited him in that capac- 
ity in his home. I was closely con- 
nected in various capacities with Pres- 
ident Wilford Woodruff, and I also 
knew President Lorenzo Snow, and 
also his successor, President Joseph F. 
Smith. . And I bear my testimony to 
the youth of Zion that I know that all 
these men hase had the Spirit of God 
resting upon them, and they have been 
actuated by the same spirit; that they 
have sought to carry on the work of 
God in the same way. Each of these 
men, perhaps, had his special gifts, 



102 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



his special qualification for the work 
that was needed at the time that he 
presided over the Church. But I tes- 
tify to the youth of Zion that their pur- 
pose has been alike; and I know that 
the purpose of those who lead us today 
is not different from the purpose of 
those who presided before them. 

I know that all of them have been 
men who sought to teach their children 
to earn that which they used, and to 
support themselves by their own ef- 
forts. I bear this testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, and I feel that as 
Sunday school workers it is our duty to 
teach the youth of Zion the truth con- 
cerning these matters, that they may 
not be led astray by the foolishness of 
men and by that which is said by those 
who are wilfully seeking to cast re- 
flections upon the work of God. "We 
find that today they bear testimony to 
a certain extent to that which was 
good in the past, but we should find 
that if they had lived in the past they 
would have fought those who led the 
work of God then as they fight those 
who lead the work of God now. It is 
not the individual they are fighting, 
but the Lord through His living ora- 
cles. They seem to exemplify that 
which our Savior said when He de- 
clared that they stoned the living 
prophets, while they garnished the 
sepulchres of the dead. 

I know the work in which we are en- 
gaged is the work of the Lord. I know, 
also, that there are among our oppo- 
nents thousands who are honest in 
their convictions, and who oppose the 
work of the Lord because of a lack of 
understanding, and because they do 
not know the purpose of the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Bui I also 
know that there are among them men 
who simply oppose the work of God 
because they could not have their own 
way, and because they could not do 
that which they had a desire to do, and 
could not get the support of the lead- 
ers of the Church in that respect; and 
I know that they would not be now op- 
posing us if it were not for the fact 
that they have not been able to influ- 



ence those who preside today to do 
that which they desire to have done. 

I pray that the spirit of truth may be 
in our hearts, that the spirit of love 
may exist with us. that we may be sus- 
tained in that which we do, and that 
we may be found at all times willing 
to honor and sustain those who do 
right, and that we may not let our 
selfishness at any time lead us to such 
an extent that we shall be blind to the 
truths of the Gospel. If any be so 
foolish as to leave the cause, it will 
simply be their own loss, not the loss 
of the work of the Lord, because this 
work will not be taken from this people 
nor given to another people, but it will 
be carried on to a successful conclu- 
sion. And may we ourselves be faith- 
ful to the end, I ask in the name of 
Jesus. Amen, 

ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT 
JOSEPH M. TANNER. 

This has certainly been a great con- 
ference, the greatest in the history of 
the Church; and those who have been 
present have undoubtedly been im- 
pressed by the spirit of the times and 
of the work of God in this dispensa- 
tion. We are here tonight, if possible, 
to focus upon the Sabbath school work 
tne spirit that has characterized this 
conference, and Ihe question naturaUy 
arises. What shall we take home with 
us as a guide to help us in our efforts 
in instructing the youth of Israel? Of 
late my mind has been impressed by 
the thought that perhaps many of the 
fathers and mothers among the Latter- 
day Saints were misconceiving the 
work of the Sabbath school, and I fear 
that in some instances there has 
arisen a belief that our children get all 
the instruction they need in religion in 
the Sunday school, and that the parents 
are excused from that duty in the 
home. Perhaps many have an idea 
that the Sunday school teachers are 
trained for the work. They believe that 
these young teachers who have per- 
chance been schooled for years in our 
Church educational institutions, know 
more about the Gospel than they, the 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



103 



fathers and mothers, know; and that, 
in consequence of what the Sabbath 
school and other auxiliary organiza- 
tions , of the Church are doing, they 
may be excused if they fail to teach 
religion to their children in the home. 
I want to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that no organization in the 
Church can take the place of the home. 
Not one can be substituted for the 
home. There is something about re- 
ligious teaching in the home that is 
not paralleled elsewhere. There is 
something in religious teaching in the 
home that has such force and such 
conviction to the minds of our young 
people that it ought never to be neg- 
lected. In the first place, in the home 
can be found the greatest love. There 
is nothing like the love of a father and 
mother, and there is no quality in 
teaching like the quality of love, and 
nothing makes its impress upon the 
heart of childhood like the affection and 
the devotion of father and mother. And 
so, when we rob our children of re- 
ligious teachings in the home, we de- 
prive them of that love and that af- 
fection that helps them tt> be de- 
voted to the cause of God; and there 
is no place in the world where our 
heavenly Father is such a reality to 
childhood as He is in the home. The 
children see Him there as they see H^m 
nowhere else. They comprehend Him 
in the home as they cannot compre- 
hend Him in the Sabbath school or 
in any other organization of the 
Church, and hence the importance of 
home religious training. Let me, 
therefore, admonish you, my brethren 
and sisters, not to imagine for a mo- 
ment that the Sabbath school is a sub- 
stitute of the home in the matter of 
the religious training of our children. 
And again, there is something about 
the authority of the home that comes 
to the hearts of the young people. They 
recognize power in the authority of 
father and mother, that is akin to the 
authority of God, the EternaL Father. 
Somehow or other, children feel that 
they must be obedient to their parents, 
next to the obedience and allegiance 
which they owe to God. Indeed, they 



feel that they cannot be loyal and 
give their allegiance to one without 
giving it to the other, and so that au- 
thority comes into the love of our chil- 
dren, and I say to you tonight that 
the two fundamental principles in in- 
culcating religion in the lives of our 
children are love and authority. And 
they are stronger in the home than 
they are elsewhere. We should, there- 
fore, admonish our teachers to do all 
that they can to encourage the par- 
ents to help them in the work of the 
Sabbath school. I care not how humble 
a home may be, I care not how little 
the father and the mother may know 
about theology, how little they may 
be familiar with the history of the 
Church, how untrained they are in the 
Bible, I care not what their natural or 
theological qualifications may be, you 
cannot take their place away from 
them in the matter of the religious 
training of their children. And so par- 
ents should not feel that because they 
are not learned in theology that they 
ought not to teach their children re- 
ligion. They should not only bear their 
testimony to their children, they should 
not only admonish them, but they 
should use their own experience to 
impress upon the minds of the youth of 
Israel the purpose and aim of the Lord 
in this day and age. I have not in- 
frequently heard parents say that they 
are leaving the instruction of their 
children to their teachers in the Sab- 
bath school and other organizations, 
and that they are relieved of that labor. 
Now the Sabbath school does not re- 
lieve the parents. It should encourage 
them. The work of the Sabbath school 
should cause the parents to keep pace 
with their children in the matter of 
reading the Scriptures; and in every 
way the Sabbath school has a tendency 
to support the home, just as the home 
has to support the Sabbath school. 

Now, I would like to ask you, my 
brethren and sisters, what are you 
to take home as the result 
of this conference? What is your 
understanding of the spirit of this 
occasion? What does it mean to 
you tonight, as you reflect upon what 



104 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



has passed during the last three days 
that this people have heen assembled 
within the walls of this building? 
Many of you will remember, some years 
ago, twenty or twenty-five, that an ef- 
fort was made to win "our children away 
from the faith. Missionary schools were 
established in our midst, and it was 
frequently said abroad that there was a 
prospect of winning the children of the 
Latter-day Saints from the religion of 
their fathers. And when we found that 
the faith of our children was to be at- 
tacked, when we discovered an attempt 
to make air inroad upon their religion, 
upon their allegiance and their loyalty 
to the faith of their parents, we set to 
with all our heart to counteract that 
influence. We were more diligent in 
our organizations. We sought out our 
children. Church schools were estab- 
lished. The songs of Zion were sung in 
the home and in the Sabbath School: 
and you know what the result of all 
that effort has been. It has been a 
system of education among our young 
people that I don't think has a parallel 
among all the sects of the world. I 
don't believe there is a denomination 
in all the world today that is giving 
that devotion, that energy and- that 
attention to the education of their chil- 
dren that the Latter-day Saints are giv- 
ing. Perhaps we needed a scare; perhaps 
we needed a warning. But the threat, 
the fight that was made against the 
faith of our children, led us to that 
energy we are now displaying, and it 
is beautiful to see this great army of 
Sabbath School workers doing all in 
their power to inculcate faith, the faith 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the hearts 
of the youth of Zion. 

Now we have come to another pecu- 
liar period in the history of our Church, 
when the respect for the leading au- 
thority is attacked, when an effort is 
being made to undermine him whom we 
sustain as the mouthpiece of God. And 
what will the result be? We need not 
be prophets when we predict that in ev- 
ery home and in every Sabbath School 
there will from this time forward be a 
renewed effort to inculcate in the hearts 
of our children that allegiance which 



we owe to the leaders of Zion, to the 
Prophet and the mouthpiece of God in 
this dispensation. For I want to say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that once 
that authority is undermined, once you 
permit the youth of Israel to question 
God's purpose in calling some one of 
His children to preside over the desti- 
nies of modern Israel, and you have 
weakened every authority in the 
Church; and if it were possible to de- 
stroy our loyalty to that authority it 
would not be long before our respect 
for every other authority in the Church 
would crumble. What would become of 
the authority of a Stake President? It 
would crumble away. What would be- 
come of the authority of a Bishop? It 
would crumble away. What of the au- 
thority of the home? It would be un- 
dermined. Hence our effort to support 
the authority of God is a question of 
the protection of our homes, the pro- 
tection of our societies, of our wards, 
of our stakes, and all the authority that 
exists throughout the Church. Men are 
badly mistaken when they think it is 
merely an action of personal agitation, 
when they think that we are endeavor- 
ing to exalt some individual to prom- 
inence. That is not it. It is a question 
of principle, and he who stands at the 
head of the Church understands the 
matter. If it were a mere personal agi- 
tation he would be embarrassed as 
much as any man in the world could be 
embarrassed. And so the lesson of this 
conference, I think, will be, a renewed 
effort among the teachers of our Sab- 
bath Schools to inculcate love and re- 
spect for the authority of God here up- 
on the earth; and it will grow. Xnd 
then think of what the results will be! 
Suppose that the Lord had something 
precious to give us through His Proph- 
et; suppose He had something by which 
a reformation was to be worked in our 
midst, and It was to be done through, 
the voice of God, through His mouth- 
piece. If we are indifferent to that au- 
thority, if we are mistaken about that 
authority, if we are not sensitive to 
that authority, pray tell me, how we 
should receive these new revelations? 
Tell me how we should comprehend the 
purposes of God, how we should under- 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



105 



stand the spirit of these times? So that 
with us it is a matter of self-preserva- 
tion. It is a matter of our individual 
testimony. It is a matter of protection 
and safety to our homes. It is simple 
enough to see why we should be loyal 
and why we cannot be otherwise if we 
would maintain our position, the posi- 
tion of our standing in the Church, and 
the position of our homes in the midst 
of Zion. Well now, perhaps we needed 
this. I have wondered whether the 
Latter-day Saints had grown somewhat 
indifferent to the authority of God. I 
have wondered in contemplating the 
present situation, whether or not this 
trouble has not arisen in conse- 
quence of the very needs of the people 
of God, that they might be stirred up, 
that they might be enlightened as to 
their duties, and place themselves in a 
position where they will be in touch 
with the light and communication of 
Heaven. It is true that the lesson is a 
hard one. It is true that it is severe, 
and it may appear to us that it is se- 
verest upon those who need it least. Did 
you ever think what these personal sac- 
rifices in these times, mean? They 
mean a blessing to Israel. They are 
for Israel; they are not for individuals, 
not for single persons. And so I say 
we should be thankful to God that we 
are stirred up in a manner that will do 
most to make us attentive to our du- 
ties, make us attentive to the authority 
of God. And so I believe that the au- 
thority of God will grow from this con- 
ference henceforth, that it will be re- 
spected, and that by reason of these 
conditions the authority of the Bishop, 
of the President of the Stake, of every 
man in the Church carrying responsi- 
bilities to God, will be stronger than 
ever before; and we shall respond in the 
Sabbath Schools throughout the world 
to the spirit of this conference, and we 
shall be the recipients of that divine 
benediction that fell from the lips of 
our President upon the conference in 
its closing hour. I suppose it will never 
be forgotten in Zion, and the Sabbath 
School teachers will tell it to their pu- 
pils, that it will be a lesson to us all, 
and that Israel will be better by reason 



of the spirit that has characterized this 
conference. 

God bless you, my fellow workers. 
May the peace of Heaven be upon you. 
This work is a grand one. We love it. 
We know it is true, and we desire to 
be faithful in all things before God and 
His servants, and be in the line of our 
duty and respect the authority that He 
has given us, because it is of Him. And 
in respecting that authority, we are 
honoring God and our position in His 
Church, and jshowing- .'the gxajtitufle 
which we feel to Him that He has given 
us these blessings. And may the peace 
of God be upon the Sabbath School 
workers everywhere, I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Elder Horace S. Ensign then sang, 
"Kind words are sweet tones of the 
heart," the congregation joining in the 
chorus. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

At every gathering of this kind, at 
each succeeding Sunday school con- 
ference, I am the more deeply im- 
pressed with a sense or a realization 
of the genuine greatness of the organ- 
ization here represented. I refer not 
only to its colossal proportions as to 
membership, its hosts of officers, teach- 
ers, and pupils, but more particularly 
to the power and influence exercised by 
this great army, and to the good effect 
thereof, inevitably manifest throughout 
the Church and beyond its numbers. 

This is one of the biggest Sunday 
schools known to me by experience or 
through report; and when we consider 
the fact that the thousands here pres- 
ent constitute but a small part of the 
big Sunday school, our wonder and 
grateful pleasure must surely increase. 

With great joy have I watched the 
growth and development of this organ- 
ization; and I feel assured, not only 
through the testimony of the Gospel, 
which is mine as a gift from God, but 
also by the ordinary exercise of the 
faculties of observation and reason- 
ing that the spirit of life is in this 
Sunday school organization. 

There is no perfunctory service rep- 
resented by this assembly; our work 



106 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



is not done by rote; we manifest no 
spiritless service in the Lord's cause, 
but instead a living- interest in His 
Church and in the Sunday school or- 
ganization as part thereof. 

I wish that those who have made it 
their business to malign and defame 
the Latter-day Saints, those who are 
afraid of our strength and yet endeavor 
to make it appear that ours is a dying 
cause, were here tonight. 

This is a magnificent organization, 
splendidly officered. To declaie that 
such an army as that now marshaled 
under our Sunday school banners, is 
directed by officers whose purpose is 
sinister and corrupt, is to speak fool- 
ishness and to invite ridicule. There 
is unity in this great organization, and 
this fact is proof of unity among those 
who lead and direct. 

It is to our Sunday school officers 
particularly I speak for the few min- 
utes allotted to me on the program of 
the evening. One reason why we re- 
spect our leaders Is this — they respect 
themselves. In general there is no 
false humility among them, neither i3 
there false pride. A man who is sus- 
tained in any office or position by the 
uplifted hands of the hosts of Israel 
must feel himself worthy of respect if 
he would win respect. "When you find 
a ward Sunday school whose superin- 
tendent does not realize the dignity of 
his calling, you have found a school 
that is weak. A stake superintendent 
who does not feel honored by the oflice 
he holds, who has no righteous pride 
in the authority conferred upon him — 
a humble pride that inspires obedience 
and yet renders his words and acts 
authoritative — such a man is a man 
out of place. 

I am not enthusiastic or eager to 
sustain men who won't sustain them- 
selves. The officers of our .Sunday 
school organization are trying to sus- 
tain themselves; are seeking to dis- 
charge with honor the duties of their 
high calling. And the result appears 
in the ever- increasing efficiency of our 
Sunday school system. Such reports 
as those to which we have listened to- 
night — reports from the stakes near 



home, and others from distant contin- 
ents and from the isles of the s^as, 
must be an inspiration to us all. 

Our success should make further im- 
provement easier. We are not yet per- 
fect in plan or in execution. In the 
course of regular appointment and as- 
signed duty I have visited some wards 
and stakes wherein I have found con- 
vincing evidence' that the officers, 
though they do well, ought to do much 
better. Some of them are found want- 
ing in true regard for and in proper 
estimation of themselves and their of- 
fice; they should develop within them- 
selves a little more of that righteous 
pride that goes hand in hand with true 
humility. 

When a man is chosen, sustained by 
vote, and ordained or set apart author- 
itatively to any office in the Church, let 
him be zealous for — jealous of — the 
power and prerogatives belonging to 
that office; let him seek to discharge 
the same in the fear of the living God. 
Let him become neither servile, nor in- 
different; the authority vested in him 
he cannot of his own action pass on to 
another; it is his to exeicise, but not 
his to give away. The special illustra- 
tion I have in mind is that shown by a 
custom followed in many of our wards 
and stakes, a habit that is spreading 
and fast becoming common. I refer to 
the mistake of regarding counselors and 
assistants in presiding quorums as be- 
ing equal in authority with the officer 
to whose aid they have been called; 
and the resulting practice of a strict 
rotation in the active duties of conduct- 
ing the exercises in Sunday schools and 
other gatherings. Each of the three, 
the principal as well as his counselors 
or assistants, has his place and his du- 
ty. Yet some of our superintendents, 
presumably in a spirit of kindness and 
through a desire to honor their asso- 
ciates, virtually vacate their place of 
presidency and temporarily permit the 
first or the second assistant to assume 
full authority, and this without due 
cause or excuse. I don't believe in 
this custom and rule of rotation, fixed 
and binding, as to the duties of pre- 
siding officer. Th^re are wards in

which exists a general understanding, a 
rule of action, in fact, regarded as hav- 
ing practically the force of a law, that 
on one Sunday the superintendent shall 
actively perform the duties of a pre- 
siding officer; and that on the next Sun- 
day he must give way to the first as- 
sistant, whose turn it is to preside, and 
on the next Sabbath the second assist- 
ant is in power. Thus, once, a month 
the superintendent himself appears in 
his place, when he ought to be there 
every Sunday. I attended a ward Sun- 
day school conference not long ago, and 
found the superintendent officiating as 
the door-keeper. Now, it is a good 
thing to have some officer near the ent- 
rance to welcome those, who come; but. 
the superintendent has other duties to 
perform. On this occasion I asked 
an explanation from the superintend- 
ent. He said, "It is the. second as- 
sistant's day today." Though it was 
conference day, the chief officer could 
not officiate; it was the second assist- 
ant's turn; he was the man of the hour, 
and the superintendent was down at the 
door. I ventured to say to him, 
"Please go up and take your place, let 
the people see you, let them know who 
you are." 

This instance is no isolated case. I 
have in mind another ward, where I 
found the first assistant really presid- 
ing, to all appearances never consult- 
ing the superintendent. Some few ir- 
regularities appeared, and I took the 
superintendent aside for a confidential 
consultation after dismissal. He de- 
sired to make no complaint, but he ad- 
mitted that it had become quite the 
habit with his assistants to introduce 
innovations on the. days of their re- 
spective turns in conducting the school, 
on which occasions the superintendent 
was practically out of office. Now, I 
believe that counselors and assistants 
in our various organizations have their 
place; but they are not the principals 
in the quorum. Two assistant super- 
intendents don't make one superin- 
tendent, any more than two counselors 
multiplied together would constitute a 
Bishop. 

In a gathering such as this it is not 



my prerogative, to speak of other or- 
ganizations than the Sunday schools, 
but I shall venture to make a compari- 
son; and if I express incorrect views I 
have full confidence that those whom I 
have lifted my hand in solemn promise 
to sustain in their exalted positions, 
will see to it that you do not go away 
with false doctrine uncorrected. 

I have observed that in many wards 
a similar practice is followed, in ward 
affairs generally. The Bishop conducts 
the services at one ward meeting, and 
at the next meeting the first counselor 
appears as the man in power; then the 
second counselor takes his turn. That 
may be right if the Bishop wishes to 
call upon one of them at any time to 
actively discharge the duties of making 
announcements, and so forth, in the 
meetings; but when the Bishop is pres- 
ent, the Bishop presides, if I under- 
stand the order of the Church: and 
if he be there no one else can in fact 
preside in that ward gathering. I don't 
understand that the President of a 
Stake can sit as one of the congrega- 
tion simply and let one of his counselors 
take charge in the strict sense of the 
term. The authority of presiding is 
not placed upon us as a coat to put on — 
to be taken off at pleasure and put on 
the shoulders of another. The Priest- 
hood cannot be so laid aside. 

I would admonish the superintendents 
to remember that they are superintend- 
ents. Strive to secure in full measure 
the spirit of your calling, then you 
won't ignore your assistants and cause 
them to feel out of place. You will give 
Ithem every opportunity to magnify 
their calling. You will be guided by 
their advice, suggestions and counsel, 
for they are counselors unto you, and 
have a right to suggest and advise, just 
as the counselors to a Bishop in a ward 
have a right to expect that the spirit of 
counsej shall rest upon them. If the 
superintendent of a Sabbath School be 
absent and the first assistant is there 
actually presiding, he exercises for the 
time the powers of the superintenden- 
cy; and he ought to follow the course 
of his superior officer and avoid intro- 
ducing changes in procedure. Indeed if 



108 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



unusual circumstances arise that .day, 
he will make it a point to take time to 
consult the superintendent as well as 
his associate assistant; and so a coun- 
selor should consult his Bishop. Where 
the counselor or the assistant is trying 
to get ahead of his chief, the spirit of 
the Lord is restrained and does not 
operate in a free and untrammeled way. 

Our presiding quorums, by direction 
of the Lord, usually consist of three 
members. There is a presiding officer 
and there are two others who in turn 
represent him in his absence, and who 
are ever ready to help him, standing, if 
they have the spirit of their office with 
them, like Aaron and Hur on either 
side of Moses to hold up his hands and 
support him in his work, not to pull him 
down or push him back that they may 
take his place. On a recent visit to one 
of the missions of the Church beyond 
the organized stakes, I found that that 
same rules of rotation was regarded as 
having the force of law in the Sunday 
school. If it so happens the first or sec- 
ond assistant's turn came on a day of 
special importance, such as the occasion 
of a conference, the superintendent was 
really superceded. He had simply to 
step aside, and give his assistant the 
full control of affairs. 

I believe that we should seek to dis- 
charge the duties of our place with 
humble pride, and with proper dignity. 
When I go into a Sunday school, I 
want to see the superintendent in his 
place. I have to inquire around some- 
times to find who he is, and then have 
to search around to find where he is. 

Nevertheless, whenever he deems it 
wise and proper whenever by any con- 
sultation or agreement with his coun- 
selors or assistants, it is decided that 
one of the assistants shall actively 
represent the superintendent on any 
day, all well and good. Do that as 
often as you Ike, my brethren, the sup- 
erintendents; only don't think that you 
have to follow the course as a rigid 
rule, or that at any time you may tem- 
porarily relinquish the responsibilities 
of your office. 

I said that our Sunday schools are 
splendidly officered. So is the Church 



as a whole, or it never would have been 
able to survive the assaults that have 
been made upon it. I have no fears 
even when I consider the evil schemes 
laid by the enemy against us; for I 
know what kind of officers we have. 

From the President of the Church 
down, we have men who, in general, 
are discharging their duties pleasingly, 
acceptably, and efficiently before the 
Lord; and as I realize what our lead- 
ers have to stand and withstand in 
this day, my heart is full of prayer for 
them, and I wish it were possible for 
me to do something in the way of help- 
ing them, something more than I seem 
able to do. 

The remark has been made here to- 
night that each succeeding president 
of the Church has been the man of the 
time, qualified for just those particular 
experiences of the Church at the time. 
I add my testimony to the truth of 
that statement; I know that this 
Church has been and is being led by 
men of God, men who are able to com- 
mune with the powers above and bring 
great forces into action. As I think 
that of them, one by one, I think of our 
living' Pronhet. Seer and Revelator to 
the Church, who stands at the head. I 
thought as I sat here tonight of Gold- 
smith's splendid simile, which slightly 
changed, is strictly applicable to our 
living prophet: 

"Like some proud cliff that lifts its no- 
ble form, 

Swells from the vale and midway 

leaves the storm; 
Though round his brow the rolling 

clouds are spread, 
Eternal sunshine rests upon his head." 

We have men who rise above the 
clouds, even as the peaks of yon ma- 
jestic range sun crowned through 
winds ar.d clouds begirt them lower 
down. 

Let us try to rise above the storms 
of petty trouble. Though I know that 
there are some weaklings amcVigst us, 
who will be influenced by the misrepre- 
sentations that are made, I know also 
that this organization is charged with 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

guarding' them, - watching them, doing 
all that can be done to prevent them 
from following in the path of the 
traitor, watching over them till they 
are able to realize for themselves what 
a despicable thing it is to be a traitor. 
I have confidence in my people. True, 
there are a few amongst us who have 
bowed the knee to Baal, but the great 
army of Israel is in readiness to take 
the field whenever the word shall come. 
They are sending forth their power, in 
faith and prayer, for the support of 
those who are charged more especial- 
ly with the direction of affairs, be it the 
affairs of the Church as a whole, of a 
stake or of a ward, or of a Sunday 
school or any other organization. 

Brethren and sisters, the funeral of 
the Sunday school cause has been un- 
avoidably postponed. (Laughter.) We 
have been invited, again and again, to 
attend the obsequies of the Church, for 
its burial has been repeatedly an- 
nounced. I never had much interest 
in that kind of an invitation; for I 
know that there is a spirit of virility, 
of life, of strength, of God-given pow- 
er, in the organization which you repre- 
sent, in those who preside over it, and 
throughout the Church of the living 
God. 

There is strength in Israel. The 
"Hope of Israel," of whom we have 
been singing, may well be called 
Israel's certainty. Amen. 

ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT 
REYNOLDS 

then announced that Brother Ensign 
would sing a sample of the Japanese 
Sunday school hymns. 

Elder H. S. Ensign said: 

My brethren and sisters, I would re- 
joice if you could join with me in sing- 
ing this song. However, you do know 
it very well, that is, in English. I will 
sing one verse of our Sunday school 
scng. "Love at Home." In translating 
this into Japanese we found it impos- 
sible to use the music as we have it in 
our Sunday school song book, and it 
has been necessary for us to write new 
music for our translation as it is in 



Japanese. I will now sing the first 
verse. 

Brother Ensign then sang in the 
Japanese language a stanza of "Love 
at Home." 

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT, 
PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

"We have now been assembled here for 
about two :hours, and I feel that it 
would be improper for us to prolong our 
meeting. 

I would like, however, to add my tes- 
timony to all the testimonies that have- 
been borne this evening, but more par- 
ticularly to endorse and emphasize the 
remarks made by Dr. Talmage in rela- 
tion to the duty of presiding officers. 
Of course we should follow in our Mu- 
tual Improvement associations and in 
our quorum capacities, and in every 
way where we have organizations in the 
Church, auxiliary or otherwise, the pat- 
tern, as nearly as we can, that the Lord 
has given us. A Bishop is the pre- 
siding officer of his ward, and wher<: 
the Bishop is in the ward, his counsel- 
ors and those who are members of his 
ward are subject to his presidency. He 
cannot yield it up. He cannot give it 
to another; or, if he does, he violates 
one of the sacred principles of the gov- 
ernment of the priesthood. He may 
direct his counselors, the first or the 
second, to do his will, to carry out his 
wishes, to execute his desires, or his 
commands; but in so doing the counsel- 
or does not act as the Bishop, but he 
acts under the direction of the presiding 
authority. He does not act indepen- 
dently of the Bishop, but subordinate to 
the Bishop, and is subject entirely to 
the Bishop's direction. This principle 
prevails, or should prevail, in the Sun- 
day school organization of the Church. 
We can commission and appoint; that 
is, those who preside, can call upon 
their aids for assistance, they can di- 
rect them to accomplish labors, but in 
every instance when they do, it is by 
and with and under the consent of the 
presiding authority, and by his advice, 
but not independently. Our missions 
have not always been organized strict- 
ly according to the pattern that th? 



110 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Lord has given. In a great many in- 
stances the presiding Elder has been 
the sole presiding officer of the mission. 

But in recent years, in many in- 
stances, it has been deemed wise, not 
only to have a pesiding Elder in the 
mission, bu»t .also assistants to the 
president, or counselors, that they may 
lender him such assistance and coun- 
sel as he may need. In all these things 
the presiding officer is the head, should 
be regarded in his place, and his place 
ghould be held sacred in the minds of 
his associates. And no man possessing 
a correct understanding of the spirit 
of the Gospel and of the authority and 
law of the holy priesthood will attempt 
for a moment to run before his fila 
leader or to do anything — assume to 
do anything that is not strictly in har- 
mony with his wish and the authority 
that belongs to him. The moment a 
man in subordinate position begins to 
usurp the authority of his file leader, 
that moment he is out of his place, and 
proves by his conduct that he does not 
comprehend his duty, that he is not 
acting in the line of his calling, and is. 
a dangerous character. He will set bad 
examples, he will mislead, he will lead 
others into error having fallen into er- 
ror himself; indeed, he is in error the 
moment he acts contrary to and inde- 
pendent of the direction of his presid- 
ing officer; and if he continues in that 
course he will go astray entirely, and 
those who follow him will follow him 
astray. I endorse what Brother Tal- 
mage has said. We all understand 
that principle, I think, and I would like 
to see my brethren and sisters who are 
connected with the Sunday school work 
observe it strictly, but in the true 
spirit; not with any kind of stiff for- 
mality or set ways, but in the true spirit 
of presidency, lovingly subject to divine 
authority, the authority that God has 
instituted, that we may emulate, the 
example of the Son Himself, who came 
to earth, and while He possessed ma- 
jestic power to heal the sick, to restore 
sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf 
and bring the dead to life, and to ac- 
complish wonderful tTiings, walking up- 
on the waves, stilling the storms, 
casting out devils, and multi- 



plying the loaves- and fishes, 
by which he fed the multi- 
tudes of people, yet in accomplishing 
all this he declared, over and over 
again, this great principle, that He 
came not to do His own will but the 
will of Him that sent Him, recognizing 
in every feature of His message and 
ministry in the world that God was at 
the head, and that He did nothing of 
Himself, but only that which the Fath- 
er sent Him to do. Thus He was act- 
ing under the authority of His presi- 
dent or file leader — of Him who sent 
Him and commissioned Him to accom- 
plish the work He was sent to do. Let 
us follow that spirit and example, and 
adopt that principle, in our lives, then 
we shall never have presiding Elders 
and officers in the Church at logger- 
heads with each other, contending with 
each other, and at cross purposes. They 
will always be one. They will see 
eye to eye, they will understand bet- 
ter the principles of divine government, 
the principles of the Gospel and the 
promptings of the Holy Spirit. 

When I came into the house this 
evening and saw the multitudes of 
people here, I felt in my heart what a 
testimony this is to the Lord of the 
integrity of this people, of you, rrfy 
brethren and sisters, who are connect- 
ed with the Sunday school work, and 
of our fathers and mothers that are 
here with us tonight. What a witness, 
what evidence, what a testimony to 
the Lord of your integrity to and love 
for the Church. You have not come 
here out of mere curiosity. I believe 
you have come here in the line of duty, 
you are here because you are engaged 
in the work of the Lord, that you have 
a deep interest in it, and not because 
there is some curious attraction to 
draw you here. I congratulate you and 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints on the manifestation of 
union, love and devotion to duty that is 
evinced here tonight by the presence of 
this vast multitude of people. I thank 
you for your presence, for the interest 
that you have taken in this work, and 
may God bless you and continue to 
preserve your lives, your faith and 
your love for the truth, from this time, 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

henceforth and forever, which is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ASSISTANT SUPT. GEORGE REY- 
NOLDS. 

I take the liberty as the treasurer 
of the union to ask the superintendents 
and all the officers to remember nickel 
day. I ask you to attend to this matter 
promptly and faithfully, and let the lo- 
cal treasurers be prompt in sending the 
mcney collected to the stake treasurer, 
and that those officers in turn, forward 



the proper amounts to the general 
treasurer, at the earliest possible date. 
We ask but one donation in the year, 
and its value is much increased by 
early remittance.

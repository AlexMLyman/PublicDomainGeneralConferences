His purposes will be accomplished, and that despite the efforts of men or devils to stay the progress of this work, it will triumph, and Christ will come and reign in power and dominion with His Saints upon the earth. May the Lord help us to keep the covenants that we have entered into, to be true to each other, to be true to the Lord, increase our faith, our hone, our charity, our good works, and by so doing others may be led to glorify the name of our Father in heaven, and be brought into His fold. God bless you, my brethren and sisters, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

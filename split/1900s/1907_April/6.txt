President Joseph P. Smith. 

I would like to say to the Presidents of Stakes and counselors, and to the Bishops and their counselors, who are present today, that we commend to their careful consideration the subjects that have been treated upon this afternoon by the brethren who have spoken â€” the observance of the divine law of health and life, the Word of Wisdom, abstinence from folly and from the wild, foolish pleasure resorts that are being so freely patronized by young people in these days. I think that the presiding priesthood everywhere should pay attention to these things, and carefullv guard the youth of Zion, as well as the middle aged and a?ed, against these foolish excesses. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! The latter-day glory begins to come forth; 

The visions and blessings of old are returning, 

And angels are coming to visit the earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Charles H. Hart. Saturday, April 6th, 10 a. m. 

Amen.

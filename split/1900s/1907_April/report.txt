representing various organizations 
of the Church. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the assembly to order, and the ser- 



vices were commenced by the choir 
and congregation singing the 
hymn : 

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand. 

Holy Spirit, 
Feed us till the Savior comes. 

The opening prayer was offered 
by Elder David McKenzie. 

The choir and congregation then 
sang the hymn : 

Redeemer of Israel, 

Our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call, 

Our shadow by day, 

And our pillar by night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 

(opening address.) 

Congratulations to Saints on abundant 
blessings. — Fidelity and diligence of 
the Priesthood and Saints generally. 
— Priesthood quorum meetings should 
be educational. — The work of the aux- 
iliary organizations commended. — 
Faithfulness in paying tithing. — The 
Church free from debt. — The general 
authorities of the Church do not re- 
ceive support from tithing. 

I am delighted to greet you at 
the opening meeting of our general 
conference. It is certainly assuring 
and extremely pleasant to see so

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



many assembled at the first meet- 
ing. I think it indicates an interest 
in the occasion on the part, especi- 
ally of the presiding authorities of 
the Church and the leading mem- 
bers. We are delighted to see you 
here, and we have only congratula- 
tions to offer to you and to all the 
Latter-day Saints for the abundance 
of the mercies and blessings of the 
Lord upon His people throughout 
the land. 

I do not desire to say anything 
this morning in a boastful spirit, 
nor with over-confidence in our- 
selves, but what I shall say I sin- 
cerely hope may be prompted by the 
Spirit of the Lord, which is the spir- 
it of wisdom, that I may not say 
anything that the Lord would not 
approve and that would not be ac- 
ceptable to you in the spirit of truth. 
I desire to briefly represent before 
this vast assembly, as the Spirit may 
give me utterance, the present con- 
dition of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, as I see it. I 
will speak first of the Presidency of 
the Church and their associates, the 
Council of the Apostles. I only 
wish to refer to them very briefly; 
for we are here before you, and it 
is probable that you will hear from 
us during this conference individu- 
ally, and will be able to judge for 
yourselves of our spirit, our faith 
and our works. I am most happy 
in saying to you that the Presi- 
dency are as united in their spirit, 
in their faith and in their works as 
they have ever been since the organ- 
ization of this Presidency. We leave 
it to you to judge whether our spirit 
is right, and whether our faith is 
founded in the truth or not. The 
Presidency and the Apostles are 
united in their feelings and in their 
love for one another. So far as I 
am able to discern, there is not a 



single thought in the mind of any 
member of the Presidency or the 
Twelve Apostles that would not 
meet with the signal blessing, ap- 
proval and sanction, of our Great 
Father and Judge. In saying this 
much for the brethren who stand 
at the head, I believe I am only do- 
ing them justice and representing 
briefly but truly the real condition 
of these two leading councils of the 
holy priesthood. I am also happy 
to say that the same goodwill, union 
love and confidence exist between 
these two bodies and the presiding 
Seventies of the Church. The First 
Seven Presidents of the Seventies 
are united with us, and we with 
them. All these brethren are dili- 
gent in the performance of their 
duty. They are willing, ready, and 
always on hand to meet every call 
that is made of them. You know 
them yourselves, they having visited 
you and preached in your Stakes 
and Wards, so you can judge of 
their spirit, and that they are in the 
faith of the Gospel, to remain for- 
ever, if they will continue to enjoy 
and cultivate the spirit of the Gos- 
pel and the love of the truth which 
pervades their souls today. We ex- 
pect that ; we look for it ; and we 
could not for one moment admit 
in our thoughts that anything other 
than that could ever occur with 
these three leading quorums of the 
Church. 

I am sorry to say that the health 
and vigor of some of the members 
of the Presiding Bishopric is not 
that which we could desire ; but they 
are united, and they have efficient 
help in their office. They are men 
who have been tried for years in 
their bishopric. They are men of 
God, men of truth and soberness, 
men of wisdom and judgment, un- 
der the inspiration of the Holy

Spirit; and God has been with 
them, as the presiding quorum over 
the lesser priesthood of the Church, 
and they have been wonderfully 
blessed. They are true men, ac- 
cording to the light and intelligence 
with which they are endowed. 

I need not say very much about 
our Presiding Patriarch. He is be- 
fore the people. He has not been 
able to travel among the people and 
counsel with the patriarchs in the 
different Stakes of Zion as much as 
we would like him to do, on account 
of family illness ; but we hope that 
the Presiding Patriarch of the 
Church will find himself strength- 
ened and relieved from embarrass- 
ments and obligations that tie him 
down, and be able to exert himself 
to visit the Saints and administer 
consolation and blessings to them, to 
strengthen their faith in bearing tes- 
timony of the truth to them, and in 
this way magnify and honor his 
holy and high calling; for it is his 
duty. Indeed it is expected of ev- 
ery man on whom responsibility is 
placed, and who is called by the 
voice of the Spirit and sustained bv 
the vote of the people, that he will 
do his duty to the uttermost, accord- 
ing to his ability and the inspira- 
tion that he is entitled to enjoy in 
the discharge of the duties of his 
office and calling. 

I can speak heartily and warmly 
of the fidelity, intelligence and wis- 
dom, strength and influence of those 
who today are acting as presidents 
of stakes. With exceedingly few 
exceptions — and I would hardly de- 
sire to admit that there is any ex- 
ception, but if there are exceptions 
they are very, very few — the pres- 
idents of Stakes and their Counsel- 
ors are men after God's own heart, 
true to their callings and their bish- 
oprics, true to the Church of Jesus 



Christ of Latter-day Saints, true to 
their office, faithful and united in 
the discharge of their duty, and dil- 
igently looking after the spiritual 
and temporal welfare of the Stakes 
of Zion over which they preside. 
They are men in whom we repose 
the most absolute confidence, men 
of integrity, of tried faith, of noble 
character, of pure lives, fathers to 
the people, whose mission it is to 
look after the welfare of Zion and 
the building up of that portion of 
the kingdom of God submitted to 
their care. I speak well of the 
Presidents of Stakes and their 
Counselors. The members of the 
various High Councils we cannot 
speak so comprehensively of, be- 
cause they are too numerous for 
us to be individually acquainted 
with them. But we know the Pres- 
idents of Stakes, and we are more 
or less familiar with their Counsel- 
ors, and we believe that care is be- 
ing taken in all the Stakes of Zion 
to have efficient High Councilors, 
men who are exemplary in their 
lives, men of good influence in the 
Stake in which they are called to 
be twelve counselors to the Pres- 
idency, and twelve judges also, to 
sit with the Presidency of the Stake 
and adjudicate and adjust difficul- 
ties and differences that may arise 
in the Stake, and to look after the 
proclamation of the Gospel, both 
by precept and by example. We 
believe that great care is being taken 
to select and to maintain efficient 
High Councils throughout Zion. 
Where there is weakness and any 
necessity for change, it is our coun- 
sel to the Presidencies of the Stakes 
of Zion to make such changes, to 
fill up the High Councils, and to be 
provided with alternates who will 
be efficient in the discharge of the 
duty that devolves upon them.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The same may be said almost uni- 
versally of the Bishops of the 
Church and their counselors. Of 
course, Bishoprics are frequently 
changed. It is often the case that 
Bishops remove to other sections 
of the country, and it becomes nec- 
essary to reorganize the bishoprics. 
Then wards are frequently divided 
into two or more, and this calls for 
more Bishops and Counselors. Oc- 
casionally men become feeble from 
age, and after serving many years 
it becomes necessary to relieve them 
from the great responsibility of 
their calling, and to call younger 
and stronger men to fill their places. 
In this way our bishoprics are more 
frequently changed probably than 
anv other council of the priesthood. 
But we do not know of any particu- 
lar deficiency in this important part 
of the priesthood. I do not think 
there is any organization in the 
Church of greater importance than 
that of the Bishopric. They are 
indeed fathers to the people. It is 
their duty to look after the widow, 
the fatherless, the ooor, the needy, 
the sick and the afflicted. They are 
expected to not only be temporal 
fathers of the people, but spiritual 
fathers also. A double duty rests 
upon them with mighty force. It 
is their business to look after the 
errinp- as well as the feeble, and to 
feel after those who are inclined to 
stray from the paths of virtue and 
honor. It is expected that the Bish- 
oprics of Wards will be in constan. 
touch with their people, and that the 
Bishop will know every member in 
his ward, through the agencies that 
are established in the Church by di- 
vine revelation, by means of which 
every member of the Church can be 
reached and his or her condition, 
spiritual and temporal, be known. 
This is a great responsibility resting 



upon our Bishops, and as a rule 
they are faithful men chosen by in- 
spiration. The choice of our Bish- 
ops is not made by the body. Let 
me say just a word in regard to 
that principle. There is no officer 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints chosen by the 
body. The Lord has given us His 
way to do these things. He has re- 
vealed to us that it is the duty of 
the presiding authorities to appoint 
and call ; and then those whom they 
choose for any official position in 
the Church shall be presented to the 
body. If the body reject them, they 
are responsible for that rejection. 
They have the right to reject, if 
they will, or to receive them and 
sustain them by their faith and 
prayers. That is strictly in ac- 
cordance with the rule laid down of 
the Lord. If any officer in the 
Church has my sympathy, it is the 
Bishop. If any officer in the 
Church deserves credit for patience, 
for longsufferinf. kindness, charity, 
and for love unfeigned, it is the 
Bishop who does his duty. And 
we feel to sustain in our faith and 
love the Bishops and Counselors in 
Zion. We say to the Bishoprics of 
the various Wards, Be united ; see 
eye to eye, even if you have to eo 
down on your knees before the Lord 
and humble yourselves until your 
spirits will mingle and your hearts 
will be united one with the other. 
When you see the truth, you will 
see eye to eye and you will be 
united. 

The truth will never divide coun- 
cils of the priesthood. It will never 
divide Presidents from their Coun- 
selors, nor Counselors from their 
Presidents, nor members of the 
Church from one another, nor from 
the Church. The truth will unite 
us and cement us together. It will

make us strong, for it is a founda- 
tion that cannot be destroyed. 
Therefore, when Bishops and their 
Counselors do not see eye to eye, or 
when Presidents and their Counsel- 
ors have any difference whatever in 
their sentiments or in their policy, 
it is their duty to get together, to 
go before the Lord together and 
humble themselves before Him until 
they get revelation from the Lord 
and see the truth alike, that they 
may go before their people united- 
ly. It is the duty of the Presidents 
of Stakes and High Councilors to 
meet often, to pray together, to 
counsel together, to learn each oth- 
er's spirit, to understand each other, 
and unite together, that there may 
be no dissension nor division among 
them. The same with the Bishops 
and their Counselors. The same 
may be said of the councils of the 
priesthood from first to last. Let 
them get together and become unit- 
ed in their understanding of what 
is right, just and true, and then go 
as one man to the accomplishment 
of the purpose they have in view. 

There is an effort being made 
(it has come more particularly to 
our notice in the near Stakes of 
Zion) - by the Presidents of Stakes 
and the presidents of the various 
quorums of the priesthood to induce 
the members of these councils to 
attend to their priestly duties. The 
High Priests' quorums should have 
their regular meetings. They should 
meet together as often as circum- 
stances will permit or as necessity 
requires, and grow and unite to- 
gether. They should establish their 
schools of instruction and enlight- 
enment ; for it is the duty of the 
High Priests' quorum to teach the 
principles of government, of union, 
of advancement and of growth in 
the kingdom of God. They are in- 



deed the fathers of the people at 
large. In our High Priests' quor- 
ums are numbered the Presidents of 
Stakes and their Counselors, Bish- 
ops and Counselors, Patriarchs, and 
all that have been ordained to the 
office of High Priest in the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood. All such be- 
long to the High Priests' quorum. 
They come under its supervision, 
and they should have a lively union 
with it, not a dead connection. They 
should be united with the quorum 
in such a way that they give it all 
the force that they can impart for 
good. They should give it their 
individual influence, their hearty 
support, their confidence, and the 
benefit of their advice and counsel. 
They should not pull apart nor be 
disinterested in these matters. 

The same may be said of the 
Seventies' quorums. I believe that 
the Seven Presidents of the Seven- 
ties have it in their hearts and 
minds to establish a better system 
of growth, advancement and in- 
struction in those quorums. The 
Seventies are called to be assistants 
to the Twelve Apostles ; indeed they 
are apostles of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, subject to the direction of 
the Twelve, and it is their duty to 
respond to the call of the Twelve, 
under the direction of the First 
Presidency of the Church, to preach 
the Gospel to every creature, to ev- 
ery tongue and people under the 
heavens to whom they may be sent. 
Hence they should understand the 
Gospel, and they should not be 
wholly dependent upon our auxili- 
ary organizations for instruction, 
neither should they be wholly de- 
pendent upon the missionary classes 
in our Church schools for their 
knowledge of the Gospel and for 
their qualifications to preach that 
Gospel to the world. They 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should take up the study of the 
Gospel, the study of the scriptures 
and the history of the dealings of 
God with the peoples of the earth, 
in their own quorums, and make 
those quorums schools of learning 
and instruction, wherein they may 
qualify themselves for every labor 
and duty that may be required at 
their hands. The Bishops should 
take especial charge of the lesser 
priesthood, and train them in the 
duties of their callings — the Priests, 
Teachers and Deacons. Our youns; 
men should be looked after. The 
boys, as soon as it is prudent, should 
be called to take part in the lesser 
priesthood. If it were possible to 
grade them, from the Deacon to 
the Priest, and from the Priest up- 
ward through all the offices that will 
eventually devolve upon them, it 
would be one of the best things that 
could be done. All these things 
should be looked after by the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church, es- 
pecially those who preside over the 
quorums. I will reneat what I said 
before, it is expected that even? man 
on whom responsibility is placed 
will do his duty faithfully, and be 
diligent in the performance thereof 
Our auxiliary organizations, I be- 
lieve, are in excellent condition. I 
need only to mention to you that 
our Sunday Schools probably have 
never had a better organization 
than they have today. There never 
has been a time in the Church when 
more attention has been given to 
imparting instruction and to form- 
ing outlines for guidance of teach- 
ers, in our Sunday Schools than has 
been given of late ; and there is a 
good, lively spirit and influence 
felt among the Sunday School work- 
ers. I will s^eak of the Relief Soci- 
ety as- one great organization in the 
Church, organized by the Prophet 



Joseph Smith, whose duty it is to 
look after the interests of the wom- 
en of Zion and of all the women 
that may come under their super- 
vision and care, irrespective of re- 
ligion, color or condition. I ex- 
pect to see the day when this or- 
ganization will be one of the most 
perfect, most efficient and effective 
organizations for good in the 
Church ; but that day will be when 
we shall have women who are not 
only imbued with the Spirit of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and witli 
the testimony of Christ in their 
hearts, but also with youth, vigor 
and intelligence to enable them to 
discharge the great duties and re- 
sponsibilities that rest upon them. 
Today it is too much the case that 
our young, vigorous, intelligent 
women feel that only the aged 
should be connected with the Relief 
Society. This is a mistake. We 
want the young women, the intelli- 
gent women, women of faith, of 
courage and of purity, to be asso- 
ciated with the Relief Societies of 
the various Stakes and Wards of 
Zion. We want them to take hold of 
this work with vigor, with intelli- 
gence and unitedly, for the building 
up of Zion and the instruction of 
women in their duties — domestic 
duties, public duties, and every 
duty that may devolve upon 
them. Our Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations are in excel- 
lent condition, and doing a good 
work. I think Brother Heber J. 
Grant, just returned from the mis- 
sion field, will bear me out in the 
statement that the young men who 
have had training; in the Mutual 
Improvement Associations make the 
most effective and successful mis- 
sionaries in the world. W e want 
this work continued, not only 
among the young men, but among 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH E. SMITH. 



7 



the young women also. The Pri- 
mary Associations are doing a /ast 
amount of good, as are our Religion 
Class workers also. The Religion 
Class work has been hampered con- 
siderably, in consequence of the pre- 
judice of some people and a dispo- 
sition to hedge up the way of the 
Gospel ; nevertheless it is accom- 
plishing good. Whatever is most 
effective of good is most hated and 
opposed by the enemy of truth. 

I want to say to my brethren 
and sisters here this morning, that 
in my opinion there never was a 
time when the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints were living better lives, 
were more faithful and more dili- 
gent, than they are today. We have 
various means of judging of this. 
One very accurate way of knowing 
is the fact that the law of tithing is 
being observed. There never has 
been a time in the history of the 
Church, I believe, when the law of 
tithing was observed more univer- 
sally and more honestly than it has 
been observed by the Latter-day 
Saints of late. The tithes of the 
people during the year 1906, have 
surpassed the tithing of any other 
year. This is a good indication 
that the Latter-day Saints are doing 
their duty, that they have faith in 
the Gospel, that they are willing to 
keep the commandments of God, 
and that they are working up to 
the line more faithfully perhaps 
than ever before. I want to say 
another thing to you, and I do so 
by way of congratulation, and that 
is, that we have, by the blessing of 
the Lord and the faithfulness of the 
Saints in paying their tithing, been 
able to pay off our bonded indebted- 
ness. Today the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints owes 
not a dollar that it cannot pay at 



once. At last we are in a position 
that we can pay as we go. We do 
not have to borrow any more, and 
we wont have to if the Latter-day 
Saints continue to live their religion 
and observe this law of tithing, It 
is the law of revenue to the Church. 
Furthermore, I want to say to you, 
we may not be able to reach it 
ripht away, but we expect to see the 
day when we will not have to ask 
you for one dollar of donation for any 
purpose, except that which you vol- 
unteer to give of your own accord, 
because we will have tithes suffi- 
cient in the storehouse of the Lord 
to pay everything that is needful 
for the advancement of the king- 
dom of God. I want to live to see 
that day, if the Lord will spare my 
life. It does not make any differ- 
ence, though, so far as that is con- 
cerned, whether I live or not. That 
is the true policy, the true purpose 
of the Lord in the management of 
the affairs of His Church. 

Before I sit down I would like 
to make another statement. Our 
enemies have been publishing to 
the world that the Presidency of the 
Church and the leading officers are 
consuming the tithes of the people. 
Now, I am going to tell you a little 
secret, and it is this : there is not 
one of the general authorities in 
the Church that draws one dollar 
from the tithes of the people for his 
own use. Well, you may say, how 
do they live? I will give you the 
key : The Church helped to support 
in its infancy the sugar industry in 
this country, and it has some meani 
invested in that enterprise. The 
Church helped to establish Z. C. M. 
I., and it has a little interest in that, 
and in some other institutions which 
pay dividends. In other words, 
tithing funds were invested in these 
institutions, which give employment

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to many, for which the Trustee-in- 
Trust holds stock certificates, which 
are worth more today than what 
was given for them; and the divi- 
dends from these investments more 
than pay for the support of the gen- 
eral authorities of the Church. So 
we do not use one dollar of your 
tithing. I thought I would like to 
tell you that much, so that when 
you hear men talking about Joseph 
F. Smith and his associates consum- 
ing the tithes of the people you can 
throw it back into their teeth chat 
they do not use a dollar of the tith- 
ing for their support. I would like 
our "friends," if I might be per- 
mitted to use a vulgar expression., 
to "put that in their pipe and smoke 
it." (Laughter.) 

A word about our Church 
schools. Our Church schools were 
never more efficient than they are 
today. We have good men at their 
head, and good teachers, Latter-day 
Saints, who are teaching your chil- 
dren principles of righteousness, 
honor, virtue, truth and upright- 
ness, as well as giving them the ben- 
efits of a secular education. Hith-' 
erto we have had sufficient means 
to take care of our schools, but 
there is nothing that I have any- 
thin"- to do with in the Church that 
has grown so fast in so short a time 
as our Church schools. I do not 
know but they will outfrow the 
Church by and by, if we do not 
put a little hedge about them. We 
will have to exercise some judg- 
ment and wisdom in their manage- 
ment, for they may grow so big 
that we will not be able to carry 
them at all. We may have to cur- 
tail them a little, and guage their 
growth and increase somewhat to 
correspond with the means avail- 
able for their suoDort. 

Many things come to my mind, 



but one thing more I will speak of. 
We have seventeen or more mis- 
sions in the world, and they are 
mostly young men who are presid- 
ing over them. [There are 23 mis- 
sions, all told.] My brethren and 
sisters, let me say to you that these 
young men are your sons, and they 
are men after God's own heart. We 
have absolute confidence in their in- 
tegrity. We know they are true- 
born and true metal. We kno v 
they can be trusted with the great 
responsibilities that devolve upon 
them. The- are noble young me i 
men of intelligence, virtue, hon< r 
and integrity, whose word is as 
good as any man's bond, I do not 
care how strong the bond may be. 
Therefore, I commend these young 
men, and say in my heart, God 
bless the Presidents of the Missions 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints throughout the 
world. Elder Charles W. Penrose 
is presiding now over the European 
Mission, where he is using the abil- 
ity the Lord has given him (which 
we know is of no mean order) in 
the proclamation of the Gospel, in 
writing editorials for the Millennial 
Star, and in exercising his influence 
and intelligence in the defense of 
the cause of Zion, and in the ad- 
vocacy of the principles of the Gos- 
pel to the world ; and he has a larg'e 
number of most faithful, energetic 
and worthy young elders seconding 
his efforts in that Mission. 

I feel that I have really tres- 
passed upon your time. I now 
wish to announce to you, that the 
Presidency and the Twelve have 
prepared a document containing our 
views, our faith and doctrines, and 
asserting the truth in connection 
with the up-building of Zion and 
the pur loses of the Church of Jesus 
Christ <f Latter-day Saints, which

■document we propose to have read 
to you this morning by Elder Orson 
F. Whitney, and then we want to 
present it to you for your accept- 
ance or rejection, as you desire, that 
it may go forth from this confer- 
ence, if approved, as an authorita- 
tive statement of our faith, our pur- 
poses and our works, as the Church 
of Tesus Christ of Latter-dav 
Saints. 

God bless you, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ADDRESS TO THE WORLD. 

The Address referred to by Pres- 
ident Smith in his concluding re- 
marks was then read to the congre- 
gation, in a clear and impressive 
manner, by Elder Orson F. Whit- 
ney. 

The document in full is inserted 
as an appendix to this official report 
of the Conference proceedings. 

After the reading of the Address 
by Elder Whitney, President Fran- 
cis M. Lyman made the following 
statement and motion : 

President Joseph F. Smith and 
my Brethren and Sisters — 
The council of the Twelve Apos- 
tles most heartily approve and en- 
dorse the princiDles and views in 
the address that has just been read. 
The tone of this document is admir- 
able. It breathes a spirit of truth 
and moderation that will commend 
it to the judgment and approval of 
all reasonable men. As stated in 
the document itself, we desire 
peace ; and as the first requisite to 
this is a proper understanding of 
the position the Church proposes 
to take with reference to the ques- 
tions that have arisen in the recent 
past, it is very proper that a straight 
forward statement of the principles 
and policy by which the Church will 



be governed should be made. The 
address just read covers that 
ground in a very comprehensive 
manner; and the times are propi- 
tious for issuing it to the world. 
The storms that have beat upon us 
for so long have subsided. They 
have passed over us, thank the 
Lord, without doing us any material 
harm. We are laboring under no 
stress of feeling, and hence we are 
in the right frame of mind to adopt 
the address. 

I therefore move that, represent- 
ing the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, in general con- 
ference assembled, we do now 
adopt this document presented by 
the First Presidency, and that we 
accept it as an expression of the 
principles and policy of the Church 
that we will advocate and sustain. 

Elder John Henry Smith, in sec- 
onding the motion for the adoption 
of the Address, said: "Believing 
that the best interests of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
are in connection with this matter, 
and the well-beine of the American 
people and the world at large, I 
most heartily second this proposi- 
tion." 

President Smith called upon all 
who favored the adoption of the 
Address to arise to their feet. In 
response nearly every person in the 
congregation arose, thus manifest- 
ing their approval of the document. 
Before calling for the negative vote. 
President Smith stated that the sub - 
ject was for the consideration only 
of Church members, and if any such 
present were not in sympathy with 
the contents of the paper read in 
their hearing, they also should arise. 
No one responded, and the motion 
was declared to have been carried 
unanimously.

ELDER DAVID 0. M'KAY. 

Regeneration of life the result of true 
faith and repentance. — Importance of 
power of resistance. — Statement of 
evils that should be resisted. 

My brethren and sisters : I hope 
that the Spirit of the Lord will 
prompt the words that may be spok- 



en by me during the few minutes 1 
stand before you. 

One expression in the document 
that we supported this morning re- 
mains in my mind, and I feel to 
touch upon it, because I believe that 
it contains much food for thought, 
as does every sentence in that dec- 
laration. It is implied therein that 
the Latter-day Saints are members 
of the Church "for the fostering oi 
spiritual life, and the achievement 
of moral and charitable ends ;" in 
other words, for the developing of 
the religious sentiment, the true re- 
ligious spirit. This may be done 
in two ways : first, by seeking the 
truth and living in harmony with 
it ; and second, by resisting every 
influence, every pozver that tends: 
to destroy or to dwarf in any way 
the religious sentiment. When the 
Latter-day Saint stood at the wat- 
er's edge, before being buried witli 
Christ in baptism, he had within 
him an implicit faith that the 
Church of Christ is established up- 
on the earth, and that this organ- 
ization is the best in the world to- 
day for the fostering of spiritual 
life, for the attaining of true re- 
ligious devlopment, for the salva- 
tion of his soul. I repeat that this 
implicit faith was within him ; and 
with that, there was a true repent- 
ance, and that repentance carried 
with it a desire to leave off every- 
thing in the past life that was con- 
trary to the teachings of the Gospel 
or the Church he was about to ioin. 
Llis old life, and the sins, if there 
were any connected with it, he truly 
repented of. He looked forward to 
the time when he would be born 
anew in the Kingdom of God. Lie 
was about to go through the ordi- 
nance of baptism, typical of the bur- 
ial of his old life and with it all the 
imperfections, the frailties, the evils. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



11 



tlie sins that accompanied that old 
living. He was to be buried by 
baptism, that like as Christ was 
raised from the dead by the power 
and the glory of the Father, he 
might come forth in newness of 
life, a member of the Church of 
God, a child of the Father, a citizen 
in the Kingdom of Christ. By bap - 
tism he was born again, and became 
a fit recipient of the Holy Spirit. 
His body came forth anew, and the 
Holy Ghost was bestowed upon 
him ; he was confirmed a member 
of the Church of Christ. That is 
where we all stood at one time. 
Those were our feelings, our faith, 
our hope. We stood that day for- 
given of past evils and follies. Now, 
the whole mission — the life, if you 
please, of soul development — was 
before us, and we had thus be- 
stowed upon us the light that em- 
anates from the Father, to lead us 
that our feet might not stumble, 
that the truths of His Holy Gospel 
might sink into our hearts — the 
truths that will give us knowledge, 
that our souls might be saved in 
intelligence. The Holy Ghost was 
to bring all things to our remem- 
brance, to show us things to come, to 
testify of the Father; and as we 
seek that light, and live in accord- 
ance with the duties that are placed 
upon us by that obligation, we are 
seeking the true religious develop- 
ment, we are fostering the true 
religious growth. 

But what is the other element 
which we must consider? Along 
with this new life, with this seeking 
for truth, there should be a strong 
power of resistance. Someone has 
said that when God makes the 
prophet He does not unmake the 
man. I believe that, though being 
born anew, and being entitled to 
new life, new vi^or, new blessings, 



yet the old weaknesses still remain- 
ed with us. The evil one was eager 
and ready to attack and strike us 
at our weakest point, and he has 
been striking on it ever since. Why? 
That he might thwart the very pur- 
pose for which we entered the 
Church of Christ. That is his mis- 
sion. Take as an example the Sa- 
vior/. After He passed through 
that ordinance to fulfill all right- 
eousness, after He had received 
the commendation of the Father, 
and the testimony from on high 
that He was the Son of God, the 
"Beloved Son" in whom the Father 
was well pleased, Satan was there 
ready to thwart His mission. Jesus 
went forth in fasting and prayer, 
preparatory for the great mission 
resting upon Him ; and when in 
His weakest moment — as Satan 
thought — when His body was weak 
and exhausted bv long fasting, the 
evil one presented himself in temp- 
tation ; and what was the tempta- 
tion? An appeal to His bodily 
weakness : "If thou be the Son 
of God — (note the taunt — the very- 
testimony on the bank of the Jor- 
dan was, "This is my beloved 
Son;") "If thou be the Son of God, 
command that these stones be made 
bread." In a moment of weakness 
and hunger, that temptation would 
be strongest, other things being 
equal. There was the moment of 
resistance on Jesus' part. His seek- 
ing had been manifested in prayer 
and fasting; His resistance came, 
at the moment of bodily weakness. 
Though the body was weak the 
Spirit was strong and Christ an- 
swered : "It is written, man shall 
not live by bread alone, but by everv 
word that proceedeth out of the 
mouth of God." Then Satan tried 
Him on another point. Failing in 
that, the tempter tried Him still on 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the third, tempted Him first on His 
love for physical comfort; second, 
tempted Him on vanity, and third, 
tempted Him on love for worldly 
wealth, and the power to rule the 
world. But all these temptations 
Christ resisted ; and the final re- 
sistance was : "Get thee behind me, 
Satan, for it is written : Thou shalt 
worship the Lord thy God and Him 
only shalt thou serve." We may 
not have heard audibly on the wat- 
er's edge, the words : "This is my 
beloved Son in whom I am well 
pleased," but the Spirit bore testi- 
mony in our souls that God was 
well pleased with the act, and He 
was pleased to lead us as we sought 
His guidance, in fasting and prayer. 
We might not have heard in audi- 
ble tones : "If you are a member of 
that Church, a member of that 
Kingdom, entitled to the Holy 
Spirit, do this or that — command 
these stones to be made bread." Our 
temptation may not have come in 
that form. It may have come in the 
form of the old love ; for the passion 
which we had satisfied for years. 
It may have been, and I doubt not 
that it was, in the form of some 
bodily temptation — some longing. 
It may have been the love of the old 
pipe which we determined — if we 
were sincere — to put aside when go- 
ing into the waters of baptism. O 
when that longing came, after we 
were in the Church or Kingdom, 
who was it that said: "Though 
you pretend to throw that aside, 
take it only once more; this once 
will not hurt." There was the nec- 
essary moment of resistance. How 
many of us stood as Christ our 
leader and said: Get thee behind 
me ! This element of resistance in 
regard to our bodily longings — sat- 
isfying the passions, applies to ev- 



ery member of the Church of 
Christ. In some way the evil one 
will attack us. In some way he can 
weaken us; in some way he will 
bring before us that which will 
weaken our souls, and will tend to 
thwart that true development of re- 
ligious sentiment; and what I mean 
bv that is this : the development of 
the spirit within, the strengthening 
of the inner man, the strengthening 
and growth of the spirit, that time 
cannot kill, but which is enduring 
and lasting as the eternal Father of 
that spirit. And the things that 
will tend to dwarf this spirit or to 
hinder its growth are things that 
the Latter-day Saints are called 
upon to resist. 

We have in the 89th section of 
the Doctrine & Covenants, the word 
of the Lord upon a few little things 
— little as considered by many, and 
particularly by the men of the 
world, which the Latter-day Saints 
are asked to. observe. It is a tem- 
poral law, and pertains to our phy- 
sical welfare. We can say nothing 
about resisting the temptation of 
vanity. That, too, comes to us ; but 
O I hope it will keep out of the 
Church. I hope our sisters will re- 
sist all the temptations of the world 
that may come under that heading 
— vanity. I hope that we may have 
strength to resist all the allurements 
that come with wealth and worldly 
position, when we make those two 
things an end in themselves. To- 
day we have only time enough to 
consider those few little things with 
which Satan tempts us, in regard to 
our body: 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord : In con- 
sequence of evils and designs which do 
and will exist in the hearts of conspir- 
ing men in the last days, I have warned 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



13 



you, and forewarn you, by giving unto 
you this word of wisdom by revelation ; 
that inasmuch as any man drinketh wine 
or strong drink among you, behold it is 
not good, neither meet in the sight of 
your Father, only in assembling your- 
selves together to offer up your sacra- 
ments before Him; and behold this 
should be wine, yea pure wine of the 
grape of the vine, of your own make. 
And, again, strong drinks are not for 
the belly, but for the washing of your 
bodies. And again, tobacco is not for 
the body neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises 
and -all sick cattle, to be used with judg- 
ment and skill. And again hot drinks 
are not for the body or belly. And 
again, verily I say unto you, all whole- 
some herbs God hath ordained for the 
constitution, nature, and use of man. 
Every herb in the season thereof, and 
every fruit in the season thereof; all 
these to be used with prudence and 
thanksgiving. Yea, flesh also of beasts 
and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, 
have ordained for the use of man with 
thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to 
be used sparingly; and it is pleasing 
unto me that they should not be used 
only in times of winter or of cold, or 
famine. All grain is ordained for the 
use of man and of beasts, to be the staff 
of life, not only for man but for the 
beasts of the field, and the fowls of 
heaven, and all wild animals that run 
or creep on the earth ; and all saints who 
remember to keep and do these sayings, 
walking in obedience to the command- 
ments, shall receive health in their nave!, 
and marrow to their bones; and shall 
find wisdom and great treasures of 
knowledge, even hidden treasures ; and 
shall run and not be weary, and shall 
walk and not faint; and I the Lord, 
give unto them a promise, that the de- 
stroying angel shall pass by them, as 
the children of Israel, and not slay 
them." 

These things mentioned here — 
strong drinks, tobacco, hot drinks — 
tea and coffee included, — are a 
few of the temporal things that Lat- 
ter-day Saints who would follow 
the true religious sentiment of this 
Church should resist. Every young 
man throughout Zion, when he 



comes forth from the waters of bap- 
tism ought to know that it is part of 
his duty to resist smoking a cigar- 
ette. Every young person in the 
Church should be taught, when 
coming from the waters of baptism, 
that he should resist the wine cup 
that is passed around at the social 
gathering. Every young member 
of this Church should know that 
tobacco in any form should not be 
used. He should resist all these 
habits, not only for the blessing 
that is promised herein by our 
Father, but because of the strength 
that will come to him to resist 
greater temptations. 

Now, just a word in regard to 
this resisting under circumstances 
that seem difficult. A younp- man 
who may refuse his coffee or tea 
at the home, and who may find it 
easy to do so, might yield when he 
is out in company at a social. When 
ail the others partake of coffee, he 
might not have strength to resist 
the temptation. That is the mo- 
ment when the true soul growth 
should be made and fostered. That 
is the moment, in the hour of great- 
est temptation, when the strongest 
resistance does the most good. It 
is not when it is in the family cir- 
cle, when father and mother's in- 
fluence help to keep these things 
away. In this respect it is to be 
hoped that every father and mother 
will set a good example. I hope 
that parents will not set bad exam- 
ples so that the children indulging 
in weakness may say, "I am fol- 
lowing you." As far as possible let 
our fathers and mothers restrain 
themselves in these things. Par- 
ents, resist that appetite. What 
though you do love it? The more 
you love it, the greater should be 
your resistance and the greater will 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be your soul development. It is no 
credit for us to resist drink, who 
do not love it. The man who grows 
most by resisting, is the man who 
resists what he loves, who will say, 
in the strength of the Gospel, "I 
will stop it, I will resist it." 

"It's easy enough to be pleasant 
When life flows by like a song, 

But the man worth while 

Is the man who will smile, 
When everything goes wrong. 

"It's easy enough to be prudent, 
When nothing tempts you to stray; 

When without or within, 

No voice of sin 

Is luring your soul away. 

"But it's only a negative virtue 

Until it is tried by fire, 
And the soul that is worth 
The honor of earth, 

Is the soul that resists desire." 

May God grant that as we are 
seeking the further establishment 
of the Kingdom of God, that we 
may instruct our young people, and 
the members of the Church every- 
where, to resist the temptations that 
weaken the body, that destroy the 
soul, that we may stand truly re- 
pentant as we were when we en- 
tered the waters of baptism, that we 
may be renewed in the true sense 
of the word, that we may be born 
again, that our souls might bask in 
the light of the Holy Spirit, and 
go on as true members of the 
Church of Christ, until our mission 
on earth is completed, and God re- 
ceives us and rewards us according; 
to our merits. May this be our lot, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Sister Edith Grant sang the so- 
prano solo, "Fear not, O Israel." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Great extent of information concerning 
purposes of God. — Testimony obtained 
by obedience. — The Church encourages 
acquisition of intelligence. — Intelli- 
gent obedience only is desired. — Integ- 
rity of the Saints. 

I rejoice with you, my beloved 
brethren and sisters, in the privi- 
leges and blessings of this another 
conference of the Church, and in 
the possession of the Good Spirit 
which has been with us thus far in 
these conference meetings. I re- 
joice in the condescension of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, in 
that He came upon the earth in the 
meridian of time and Himself 
taught the children of men the 
great plan of life and salvation, 
which plan was instituted from be- 
fore the foundations of this earth. 
He, so far as it was possible, made 
an object lesson of every principle 
of the Gospel, by living and yield- 
ing obedience unto the same Him- 
self. He lived a perfect life, filled 
His mission completely, and has 
asked of us to do only what He 
has done, perform our duty as it is 
made known unto us. It is the de- 
sign of the Father that the Gos- 
pel shall be taught to all the chil- 
dren of men, that they may learn 
the will of the Father, and know 
what requirements are made of 
them in order to obtain eternal life. 
Through the mercy of our Father 
in Heaven, all His children will 
have that privilege. I rejoice that 
we have such a complete record 
of the Savior's mission, and His 
teachings, as that contained in the 
New Testament. I appreciate the 
additional knowledge that has 
come to us concerning the great 
plan of salvation by the coming 
forth of the Book of Mormon, by 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



15 



the revelations contained in the 
Book of Covenants, and by the 
words of inspiration that have come 
to us from time to time through the 
mouths of His servants, whom He 
has honored with the Holy Priest- 
hood and authority to preach the 
Gospel and administer in the or- 
dinances thereof. 

I rejoice that there have been so 
many of our Father's children who 
have heard the truth, who have 
been willing to accept it, and make 
the sacrifices that were required at 
their hands, for assuredly it has re- 
quired great sacrifice. Our fathers 
and mothers, many of them who 
heard the Gospel in the world, have 
forsaken their homes, their occupa- 
tions, the love and friendship of 
their parents and brothers and sis- 
ters, and all that was dear to them 
in this life, and have cast their lot 
with a despised people, and made 
these sacrifices because of the love 
which they had for the Gospel and 
the testimony which the Lord gave 
them of the truthfulness of this 
work. The Lord has borne rec- 
ord to every faithful son and 
daughter who has yielded obedi- 
ence to the principles of the Gospel, 
that this work is true, that there is 
no other plan devised, no other 
way under heaven, by which man- 
kind can obtain salvation and eter- 
nal life. There is no way to ex- 
altation except by yielding obedi- 
ence to the principles which are 
taught by the Latter-day Saints, re- 
vealed in this last dispensation 
through the prophet Joseph Smith, 
the same principles, in the same 
order, as they were taught by 
Jesus Himself, having the same 
saving power. Those who have 
yielded implicit obedience to these 
principles know of a surety that 
the work is true; and they have 
not only obtained this knowledge 
and strength and courage from the 



Lord, which enabled them to make 
the sacrifices that have been re- 
quired at their hands, but many 
have laid down their lives for the 
truth of the Gospel and the testi- 
mony which the Lord has given 
them. I rejoice that today we 
have a multitude of men and wo- 
men of like integrity. I have no 
doubt that all those whom Presi- 
dent Smith has mentioned in his 
opening address in this conference, 
all those officers, with very few ex- 
ceptions, if any, would be willing 
to lay down their lives, if neces- 
sary, for the salvation of the chil- 
dren of men, and that they them- 
selves may obtain eternal life. 

It is a rare thing to find a man in 
this Church, in full standing, who 
refuses to do anything that he is 
asked to do. Why? Because he 
has an intelligent understanding of 
the plan of life and salvation. He 
knows that it is God's work, and 
that man does not elect himself to 
office, or assign to himself the part 
he is to perform in this kingdom, 
but every man who has heard the 
word and had the privileges of the 
Gospel is expected to give his time 
his talents, his means — all that he 
has, if need be — for the building 
up of the kingdom, the salvation 
of the human family, but he does 
not yield a blind obedience. 

It is a mistaken idea, prevalent 
in the world, that the perpetuity of 
this work depends upon the au- 
thorities keeping the masses of the 
people in ignorance. The truth is 
the direct reverse, else why have 
we all these auxiliary organizations 
and quorums of priesthood in the 
church, for the education of the 
rising generation. Their being es- 
tablished in the faith depends upon 
their knowledge of the Gospel. 
Our greatest fear concerning our 
children in Zion is the possibility 
of their growing up in ignorance 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of the everlasting Gospel, for it is 
only that class — with few excep- 
tions — who give up the faith. Pos- 
sibly some who have had a little 
faith in the Gospel have been over- 
come by temptation and fall- 
en from grace; they have not had 
enough faith to bring about re- 
pentance in their hearts, to humble 
themselves and regain their stand- 
ing. It may be we have lost a few 
of our sons and daughters on this 
account, but we never see them 
uniting with other churches and 
denominations. They are sure we 
have the true Gospel and Church 
of Christ, with all its saving power. 
Respecting those who have receiv- 
ed the testimony of the Gospel, our 
fear is that they may become in- 
different, that they will not join the 
auxiliary organizations, and that 
they do not always receive at their 
firesides in their homes the instruc- 
tions concerning this work that 
they should receive, and because 
they have not retained a knowledge 
of the Gospel their eyes may be 
blinded. But we do know that 
where our sons and daughters are 
virtuous and upright, and have a 
knowledge of the Gospel, that they 
love it; it appeals to their judg- 
ment and intelligence, and they 
will hardly lay down the truth for 
a falsehood. We believe in our 
young people being educated in the 
district schools and in the colleges, 
for we believe that intelligence 
gained from those sources is neces- 
sary to enable them, as they grow 
up, to assume the responsibilities 
that now rest upon the shoulders of 
their parents. This education is 
necessary to make them more pro- 
ficient in preaching the Gospel 
abroad, and in ministering among 
the people at home. Above all, we 
believe in the religious training of 
our children, and we give evidence 



to the world that we are sincere in 
this expression. 

I do not see how the people of 
the world can consistently charge 
the Latter-day Saints with being 
insincere, or that our union and 
strength are caused by the alleged 
fact that we are ignorant as to the 
methods, designs, and purposes of 
the authorities of the Church. Be- 
fore coming into the Church, men 
and women are taught the princi- 
ples of the Everlasting Gospel, the 
principles of righteousness, and are 
informed concerning the course of 
life they will be expected to pur- 
sue as members of the Church ; 
and, without a covenant on their 
part to observe and keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord, to live 
righteous and pure lives, and make 
complete reformation, they are not 
received into the Church. There is 
no way to become members of this 
Church except through faith in 
God the Eternal Father, and in His 
Son Jesus Christ, and repentance 
from sin. We must confess our 
sins ; we must come forth with 
broken hearts and contrite spirits, 
and give evidence that our repent- 
ance is genuine, that we are sin- 
cere in what we are undertaking; 
when we have done this, and have' 
yielded obedience to the principle 
of baptism, we receive as a result 
the forgiveness of sins. Then fol- 
lows the laying on of hands for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, and we 
receive light and intelligence, and 
the fulfillment of the promise of 
the Lord that we shall know of 
the doctrine; thus we are made 
better for. having received the Gos- 
pel, if we have been true to our 
covenants. 

The fact that we are not all of 
us true under ail circumstances is 
evidence of the necessity for of- 
ficers in the Church whose duty it 



ELDER GEORGE E. RICHARDS.

is to encourage the people to works 
of righteousness, not to force or 
oblige them to do something re- 
garding which they have not be- 
come converted. No man nor 
woman is asked to do anything 
that they are not first thoroughly 
convinced is the right and proper 
thing for them to do for their soul's 
salvation. We labor with men and 
women in all kindness and gentle- 
ness, and with love unfeigned. We 
do all we can, pray for them, coun- 
sel with them, and help them 
along; that is the method of the 
officers in the Church, not to force 
men and women into a line of 
duty. Men come into this Church 
of their own free will and choice, 
and they can just as easily leave 
it, if they think they have made a 
mistake. I thank the Lord that 
there are very few who have in all 
sincerity embraced the Gospel that 
ever had any desire whatever to 
retrace their steps ; those who have 
fallen away have done so because 
of their own disobedience to the 
laws of righteousness, not because 
they have discovered in the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, as taught by 
the Latter-day Saints, any error, 
or anything that tends to degrade 
mankind. They must acknowledge 
that those principles are ennobling. 

If all of us would yield implicit 
obedience to the principles of the 
Gospel, we would indeed be a hap- 
py people. The evil results of the 
use of strong drink would be 
averted if we all yielded obedience 
to this word of wisdom, to which 
reference has been made this after- 
noon, and so with the other laws. 
One of the greatest arguments in 
favor of faithfulness on the part 
of the people, in observing the 
word of wisdom, is that it gives 
evidence to our Father in heaven, 
and to one another, our willingness 



to obey His wishes. We do not 
care to argue as to the effects of 
drinking a little liquor, or smok- 
ing a pipe or cigar, or drinking tea 
and coffee. When the Lord com- 
manded Adam to build an altar 
and offer sacrifices to His name, 
do we hear of Adam arguing with 
the Lord? Adam did not say: I 
see no necessity for offering a sac- 
rifice, and I would like to know 
why this requirement is made of 
me." When the angel came to 
Adam and asked why he offered 
sacrifices, what was his reply ? He 
said: "I know not, save God has 
commanded it;" and then the angel 
explained this matter to him. When 
the Lord commanded Abraham to 
offer up his son as a sacrifice, we 
do not hear of Abraham parleying 
with the Lord and wanting to 
know why. It was sufficient for 
him to know it was the will and 
word of the Lord unto him. He 
undertook to do what the Lord re- 
quired; he made the sacrifice in 
spirit, and it was accepted of the 
Lord. And so, obedience to the 
will of the Lord is the principle 
we must learn. This simple word 
of wisdom, adapted to the weakest 
of those who may be called 
"Saints," is given that we may 
manifest to the Lord, in this little 
thing, whether or not we are obed- 
ient and willing to do what He re- 
quires at our hands. As a matter 
of intelligent obedience — not blind 
obedience — we should observe to 
keep the word of wisdom. For the 
same reason we should observe to 
keep holy the Sabbath day, and the 
name of our Father in Heaven, 
and His Son Jesus Christ, and in- 
telligently yield obedience to every 
requirement that is made at our 
hands. 

I love the Latter-day Saints. I 
pray God to bless them and keep

them in the faith. I have had the 
pleasure of associating with a 
great many of them during the 
past year, having traveled more 
than twenty thousand miles, visit- 
ing the Saints in the stakes of Zion 
and in the mission field. I have 
found them in the world, and in the 
stakes of Zion just as true to the 
Gospel as the most faithful of these 
men and women here near the head- 
quarters of the Church. I know 
of their integrity; I have heard 
their testimonies ; I have heard 
their presidents speak well of them. 
I have seen them in the auxiliary 
organizations working like bees in 
a hive. I do know something of 
the strength of the veterans of 
Zion, and the faith and integrity of 
the youth of Zion, and I doubt them 
not. There is a very small percent- 
age of the boys and girls, sons and 
daughters of the Saints, who will 
be recreant to the faith of their 
parents. Our young people are, 
in a large measure, as I have said, 
true and faithful, and they will 
continue so, and the Lord will 
prosper Zion, and bless His people. 
Zion will triumph; the truth will 
prevail, and God's purposes will be 
consummated in the earth. May 
the Lord help us all to be faithful, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Faithfulness and zeal manifest in the 
missions. — Observance of the Word of 
Wisdom a means of exaltation. — Faith 
and intelligence increased by obedience 
to the laws of health. — Transmission 
of tendency to physical and mental 
weakness. — Evidence of faith is keep- 
ing the commandments. 

It is very remarkable to me how 
rapidly the time passes. It does 
not seem six months since we were 
in our last general conference, and 



I occupied this same position. 
Since then it has been my privilege 
to go into the mission field, and to 
visit some of the branches of the 
Church in different portions of the 
United States. The testimony of 
President Smith of the worth of 
our Mission Presidents coincides 
with my feelings. I met a number 
of Presidents of Missions in their 
fields of labor, and found them de- 
sirous of building up the Church 
of God, and they are laboring dil- 
igently to that end. I had the 
pleasure of meeting many of your 
sons and some of your daughters 
also, who are giving their time and 
ability to the promulgation of the 
work of our Father. I rejoiced in 
the testimonies they bore. I dis- 
covered that the sweet Spirit of the 
Lord was with them, and that they 
were happy, even though their 
names, in many cases, were cast 
out as evil because they were mem- 
bers of the Church of Christ. I 
listened to the testimonies of those 
who are members of the Church, in 
the Eastern and the Southern 
States, and they bore the same wit- 
ness that is expressed in our meet- 
ings at home when opportunity for 
testimony is afforded. I find, 
wherever I go among the branches 
of the Church, that the spirit which 
should characterize the Elders of 
Israel and the members of the fold 
of Christ is strongly manifest in 
the lives of its devotees. 

Speaking of the apparently rap- 
id way that time passes, I am re- 
minded that none of us are here in 
this life very long. We believe 
that we are harvesting the fruits 
of our pre-existent lives, and earn- 
ing here the reward we expect to 
reap when we go hence. The Lord 
has indicated to us that by faith 
we can please Him, and that by 
keeping His commandments we 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



19 



can draw near unto Him. We are 
fold that faith is a gift of God, and 
that in return for obedience our 
faith is increased. Thereby we 
grow in strength, and we feel the 
presence of the Holy Spirit more 
abundantly. Some of the brethren 
have spoken to us today concerning 
one of the temporal laws of the 
Lord — the Word of Wisdom. I 
sometimes wonder if Latter-day 
Saints realize that it has been given 
to us for our exaltation ;not only for 
our temporal blessing.but to prepare 
us for spiritual life. It was my 
observation in the mission fields 
that the Elders who manifested the 
most faith, who seemed to have the 
greatest assurance of the divinity 
of this work, were those who had 
kept this law of the Lord. I found 
that many of those who, in times 
past, had questioned the divinity 
of this Church, had tampered with 
things which the Lord has said 
are not good for us. We are told 
that the glory of God is intelli- 
gence, and we all admire intelli- 
gent men and women, therefore it 
should be our desire to lay the 
foundation for increased mental 
power and not do anything to 
weaken it. It is evident in the 
lives of some that they deprive 
themselves of the brain power they 
might enjoy, by the continued use 
of things our Heavenly Father has 
said are not good ; they become less 
intelligent as a result, and fail to 
make the preparation for Eternal 
life that should be their ambition. 

I am fully convinced that the 
Lord in His mercy, when He gave 
us the Word of Wisdom, gave it 
to us, not alone that we might have 
health while we live in the world, 
but that our faith might be 
strengthened, that our testimony 
of the divinity of the mission of 
our Lord and Master might be in- 



creased, that thereby we might be 
better prepared to return to His 
presence when our labor here is 
complete. I fear that, as sons and 
daughters of Zion we sometimes 
fail to realize the importance of 
this great message to the world. 
Sec. 89 of the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants is not only a Word of Wis- 
dom to the members of this Church 
but it is a law for the temporal 
salvation of all of our Father's 
children in the world, and it be- 
hooves the Latter-day Saints to de- 
clare the truth of this law to all 
men. We observe that compliance 
with the laws of health produces 
mental and physical strength, and 
we discover that through disobedi- 
ence thereto, mental and physical 
deterioration follows. It is our 
Creator, the Father of our spirits, 
who gave us opportunity to dwell 
upon this earth, who has said that 
certain things referred to in that 
revelation are not good for us. He 
has made us valuable promises, if 
we will obey this law, — promises 
of wisdom, of health and strength, 
and that the destroying angel shall 
pass us by and not hurt us, as he 
did the children of Israel. I look 
upon the Word of Wisdom as kind 
advice of our Father in heaven, 
who desires to see His children be- 
come more like Him. He sent me 
into the world that I might de- 
velop my manhood and magnify 
my opportunities. I take it as the 
fatherly counsel of one who, know- 
ing what I needed, said to me: 
"Mv son, these things are not good 
for you, and if you will avoid them 
I will give you the companionship 
of my Holy Spirit and joy while 
you live in the world and in the 
end eternal life. How foolish 
I would be then to partake 
of these forbidden things, having 
the assurance that it is the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



counsel of the Lord I should ab- 
stain therefrom. I would feel 
under condemnation if I should par- 
take of them,when He who knows 
better than anybody else says that 
they are harmful, and has warned 
me against them. 

Tobacco often affects the heart; 
and many men who have been phy- 
sically strong in their childhood 
have weakened that vital organ in 
young manhood by the tobacco 
habit, and in many cases the mal- 
ady is transmitted to their off- 
spring. Sometimes consumption 
results from the use of those 
things God has forbidden; the 
tissue of the lungs and the mem- 
branes give way, disease sets in, 
and the violator of the law of 
health goes to an untimely grave. 
Unfortunately the scourge does 
not always stop with them; they 
transmit it to their children — those 
blessed jewels in whose develop- 
ment they expect to rejoice in the 
Kingdom of God. It is well 
known that many dread diseases 
are transmitted from one genera- 
tion to another, and have the effect 
of weakening the mental and phy- 
sical powers of the race. Surely we 
do not want to be among those 
knowingly guilty of increasing the 
burdens of those yet unborn. The 
Lord has warned us that the sins 
of the fathers will be visited upon 
the children to the third and fourth 
generation ; and it is said that those 
who walk uprightly before the 
Lord and obey His counsel will 
bequeath virtues to their offspring. 
I believe that the Word of Wis- 
dom is a natural law, and that it is 
incumbent upon the Latter-day 
Saints to obey the Lord in this as 
in other matters. In the world to- 
day we find that consmption, heart 
troubles of various kinds, tubercu- 
losis, cancer and other dread dis- 



eases, usually regarded as of a her- 
editary nature, are on the increase, 
and they send thousands to the 
grave annually. There is no doubt 
that, in many cases, their begin- 
ning is traceable to the causes I 
have named. How terrible we 
would feel if, having weakened our 
physical structure and mentality by 
the use of these forbidden things, 
we should find that we have left 
as a heritage to our children, weak- 
nesses that may be handed down 
from generation to generation un- 
til our names shall be obliterated 
from the earth ! Oh, how I wish 
the sons and daughters of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints could understand 
the importance of this law ! How 
I wish that the fathers and mothers 
who tamper with these things, and 
then offer excuses for themselves, 
might understand that they are 
bringing humiliation and distress 
upon their children. We are 
taught that the glory of our Heav- 
enly Father will be shared by us, 
if we are faithful. If I am hon- 
orable and keep the commandments 
of the Lord, I believe that my chil- 
dren will inherit similar strength 
of character. On the other hand, 
if I plant in them appetites and de- 
sires for those things which the 
Lord has forbidden, whereby they 
transgress His laws, forfeit the 
companionship of His Holy Spirit, 
and go outside the pale of the 
Church, when I go to the other side 
and find that by my unfaithfulness 
and determination to be a law unto 
myself, I have placed a stumbling 
block in the way of my children, 
so that they are deprived of ex- 
altation in the presence of the 
Father, all the excuses I have made 
in this life will be of no avail. 
Brethren and sisters, let us not be 
a community of excuse-makers. 
Let us not be among those who say 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 



21 



that, because they are old and 
feeble, they must have these things. 
The Lawgiver made no distinction 
for age ; let us make none. The 
older we are the mo're exemplary 
should be our lives. I do not feel 
to criticise or condemn any of those 
who have violated laws of the 
Lord, I do not feel to say unkind 
things of them; I sympathize with 
them deeply, and I pray that the 
Lord may come to their rescue be- 
fore it is too late, and assist them 
to overcome. 

Brethren and sisters, we cannot 
with impunity look slightingly up- 
on the Word of Wisdom. It was 
given as counsel and advice, not 
by commandment or constraint, 
but as a word of wisdom, from our 
Father, for the temporal salvation 
of our bodies and the preparation 
of our souls for eternal life. He 
thought it of enough importance 
to give it unto us, and to warn us 
and if He who knows all things 
thought it necessary to give ad- 
vice and counsel upon these temp- 
oral matters, how carefully we, 
who know not what the morrow 
has in store for us, should observe 
that divine counsel. I feel that 
the Latter-day Saints have in the 
Word of Wisdom a law that will 
exalt them and lift them above 
those who fail to keep it. As I 
have already said, fathers and 
mothers, if they will keep the 
Word of Wisdom, may transmit 
to their offspring virtues and 
strength that they could not other- 
wise give to them. I believe that 
the companionship of the Spirit of 
our Father will be in the hearts 
and homes of those who keep this 
law, and their desire to be obedient 
will be transmitted to their chil- 
dren. Brother McKay, who spoke 
on this subject, has had evidences 
in his educational work of the im- 



portance of students observing 
this law. It is a well known fact 
that the effect of tobacco upon the 
child brain is most harmful, des- 
troying the memory and dulling 
the finer senses ; also, that the ef- 
fect of liquor upon the youthful 
brain is very deleterious : it breaks 
down the desire to be honorable 
and upright, and leads to vice and 
crime. The baneful effect of tea 
and coffee upon the nerves of wo- 
mankind is too well understood to 
admit of argument. And so it is 
all along the line. The Lord has 
given us this law in kindness and 
love, promising certain blessings if' 
we will obey His counsel. I feel 
to exhort you, by brethren and sis- 
ters, to teach this in your homes. 
Call the attention of your growing 
children to it, and to the 
reward predicated on its ob- 
servance. Let me say to you 
that the best evidence of our 
faith in that law, that we be- 
lieve it came from God, is a con- 
sistent observance of it in our lives. 
We may preach it all day long, but 
if we transgress it in practice, our 
example may be disastrous to those 
we love better than life, for they 
will feel that they can safely fol- 
low where we lead. 

I am thankful for the sons and 
daughters of Israel, for their 
virtue and temperance, and rejoice 
in their righteousness. I thank 
the Lord that we have been planted 
in this land of Zion, which He- has 
said is blessed above all other 
lands. Today, I raise my voice in 
humility and pray that we may 
have strength to observe the Word 
of Wisdom and all other laws of 
the Lord, that our lives may com- 
port with the dignity of the great 
Church with which we are identi- 
fied, that men and women every- 
where, seeing our good works. 



21 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



may be led to glorify our, Father 
which is in heaven; that in the 
future the sons and daughters of 
Zion may bless us for examples of 
integrity bequeathed to them; that 
our brothers and sisters of other 
faiths may be able to say, "There 
are men and women in the valleys 
of the Rocky Mountains, who live 
According to their teachings to 
others, evidencing their belief that 
those principles are from God." 

I pray that our Father may bless 
the man who stands at the head 
of this work, with his counselors, 
and those associated with them, 
that each may be inspired to teach 
in power and plainness the truths 
of heaven; that the Presidents of 
Stakes, who so faithfully and ener- 
getically discharge their duties in 
the organized Stakes of Zion, may 
find joy in their ministry, and that 
the Bishops and other officers may 
receive abundant blessings from 
the Lord for their labors among 
His children. I pray that love for 
the Gospel may be found in the 
hearts of the rising generation, that 
they may prepare to teach its truths 
to the convincing of the honorable 
of the earth. That day and night, 
by reason of our devotion to those 
things that are right and pure and 
true, the Spirit of our Father may 
tabernacle with us, that we may re- 
joice in its companionship. I 
pray that His Spirit may be poured 
out upon all the world, wherever 
men and women desire to know 
His will and keep His command- 
ments ; and that it may find its way 
to those who are not disposed to 
keep the laws of God, that the 
spirit of repentance may come up- 
on them ; that all may be prepared 
for the time which we are assured is 
not far distant, when the Lord will 
suddenly come to His temple; that 
His children may rejoice in His 



presence and receive eternal life at 
His hands, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

General unanimity of the Priesthood 
and members of the Church. — Vain 
following of fashion censured. — The 
Saints "a menace" to crime. — Warning 
against the skating rink craze, and 
excess in amusements. 

My brothers and sisters, there is 
nothing gives me more happiness 
than the knowledge that the Latter- 
day Saints are progressive and 
prosperous, both spiritually and 
temporally. I am exceedingly well 
pleased at the large attendance upon 
this conference, and with the ad- 
dresses that have already been de- 
livered. I rejoice in the opening 
statement of President Smith con- 
cerning the condition of the Church, 
because I myself know that state- 
ment to be the truth. My experi- 
ence in traveling throughout the 
lands where the Saints are gath- 
ered confirms the truth of his re- 
marks, and proves to me that they 
are conservative and just. I rejoice 
in the general faithfulness of the 
Latter-day Saints, in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord. The 
counsel and advice that was given 
to the Presidents of Stakes, the 
Bishops of Wards, the Presidents 
of Quorums and other leading 
brethren, that they be united and 
see eye to eye, is veritably complied 
with by those authorities, with few 
exceptions. Not only is this the 
case with the authorities of the 
Church throughout Zion, but it is 
the case with the Latter-day Saints 
universally; as to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ they see eye to eye. 
The fundamental principles and 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



23 



doctrines of the Church are under- 
stood alike by all its members. They 
all understand faith to be the first 
principle, and you will not hear any 
one declaring that some other prin- 
ciple i's first. They also see eye to 
eye in relation to repentance, the 
second principle in the Gospel. The 
same as to baptism, the manner and 
purpose of it, and the condition that 
the individual should be in at the 
time of baptism, are all understood 
perfectly, and there is no schism in 
the Church in relation to this or- 
dinance. There is not more than 
one plan, there is only one way, 
and that is, baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins, being 
buried in water, and being brought 
forth out of the water into newness 
of life. As to the reception of the 
Holy Ghost, there is no difference 
of opinion among the Saints. That 
He can be received only by the lay- 
ing on of hands of one having au- 
thority is a doctrine of truth re- 
vealed anew in this dispensation 
through Joseph Smith. It was a 
doctrine promulgated by Christ and 
practiced by Him and His Apostles 
in primitive times. And thus have 
we all received the testimony of the 
Spirit, and He has borne record 
unto us that these are the doctrines 
and principles of the Gospel of 
Christ, which is the power of God 
unto salvation, and which we all 
understand alike. Is it not an evi- 
dence, if we do comprehend them 
alike, that we possess the same Spir- 
it, which has given us the same tes- 
timony and revealed to us the same 
truths? In relation to tithing, it 
has already been said that the 
Saints are faithful in observing this 
law, and there is no misundertand- 
ing in relation to it. 

As to the Word of Wisdonj, I be- 
lieve many of the Latter-day Saints 



fail in a measure to observe that 
law. I do not know that any of 
them fail to understand it. Those 
who do not keep the Word of Wis- 
dom will admit that they do wrong. 
If those who neglect to observe that 
law could but develop within them 
the power which cometh of repent- 
ance and righteous desire, and resist 
the temptation, it would be better 
for them and their children, and for 
the Church at large. 

There are other follies that find 
place among us and that are indulg- 
ed in to some extent despite the 
general faithfulness and integrity 
of the Saints. Brother McKay sue- 
gested to the sisters the hope that 
they would not become vain after 
the manner and fashion of the 
world. I endorse his remarks on 
this subject. I will go further than 
that and apply the same reflection 
to the men; for, so far as I have 
observed, the men are as liable to 
be vain as the women. As to their 
clothes, and other things, they are 
as punctilious and as anxious to 
observe the fashions as are the 
women. They want the latest cut 
of trousers, coats, and vests, tV>~ 
newest style of hats, the latest shoes 
and so on. So that we may as well 
apply the plaster to cover the whole 
wound, because men also are inclin- 
ed in this direction. I believe in 
being moderate in these things, that 
it may not be said of us as it was 
said by a prophet in former times, 
that all is vanity under the sun. We 
find a little of it now and again, of 
course. Let us clothe ourselves be- 
comingly and neatly, even richly if 
we can afford it, without catering 
to the fashions and ways of the 
world. 

Brethren and sisters, we who 
have supported this declaration of 
principles which has been read will, 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I hope, live according to its pre- 
cepts ; that our lives will conform to 
the truth ; that we will desire to 
know the truth, and knowing it, 
seek power from the Lord to live 
according to it; that we will not 
yield to the temptations and 
evils that beset us, and that would 
lead us astray. Many of these 
evils and temptations are now in 
our midst. The Latter-day Saints 
are frequently called by our enemies 
a menace to good government, to 
good order, to law, etc., which we 
deny. If the Latter-day Saints are 
a menace at all, they are a menace 
to sin and vice of all kinds, to error, 
to falsehood, to outlawry, and an- 
archy, and all such. We are op- 
posed to these things, nevertheless 
some of these unwelcome evils 
creep in stealthily among us. Sa- 
loons are a menace which, if we 
had our way, would be absolutely, 
abolished from among the people. 
They are the greatest destroyers of 
the home, American and others, and 
I am sorry that there are men of 
intelligence who do not so regard 
the saloons. The Sunday theaters 
and amusements are a menace to 
the morals and welfare of the peo- 
ple, both young and old. So far 
as I am concerned, I disapprove 
most emphatically of all such things 
on the Sabbath day, and I disap- 
prove of some species of amuse- 
ments on week days as well ; I be- 
lieve they are evil, and their influ- 
ence is bad. Skating rinks are a 
menace, and at the present time the 
desire to frequent them is a craze. 
They are being introduced in cer- 
tain Stakes of Zion, and the young 
people are going wild over this pas- 
time, which they carrv to excess. 
As a result of enthusiasm in rela- 
tion to this so-called pleasure we 
mark the downfall of far too many 



young men and young women. I 
disapprove of these and other places 
of amusement where young people 
are thrown promiscuously into the 
society of the wicked, who care 
neither for God nor man, for vir- 
ture nor decency. To allow pure 
girls and virtuous boys to mingle 
in the society of men and women 
who are steeped in sin is little short 
of a crime on the part of parents 
and guardians of the young. To 
the extent that these things are car- 
ried to excess and are not governed 
properly I disapprove of them, both 
Sunday and week days. I warn the 
Latter-day Saints against them 
They ought to warn their children 
against them, and keep them away 
from Sunday theatres, from Sun- 
day dance-halls, from skating rinks 
and other like resorts. If they at- 
tend such places on week days, thev 
should be accompanied by their par- 
ents, or by responsible people who 
can keep them from being led astray 
and from falling into sin. I look 
upon these resorts as dangerous. If 
we value the innocence, virtue, and 
purity of our youth, then we 
should see to it that their innocence, 
virtue and purity is guarded, that 
our children are kept away from 
contaminating influences, and that 
such influences are kept away from 
them, just as far as lies in our 
power. 

Wherever the Saints are assem- 
bled in the land we find a goodlv 
degree of faithfulness. They are 
observing the laws of the Gospel, 
they are prayerful, but it would be 
well if they were more so. Wher- 
ever there is room for improve- 
ment, I hope we will take advan- 
tage of the opportunities within our 
reach to make anv needed reforma- 
tion. 

May* God bless vou, guard you

from evil and give you the power 
to guard from evil those entrusted 
to your care. May He give to the 
Priesthood wisdom and foresight to 
warn the Saints of evil and sin, and 
to instruct them in the ways of 
righteousness ; and may He put int j 
the hearts of the people the love of 
the Holy Priesthood, and willing- 
ness to listen to good counsel and 
follow it. In the history of the 
Church the Saints have never gone 
wrong, not in one instance, when 
they have followed the advice of the 
Holy Priesthood ; neither will they 
ever go wrong in following that ad- 
vice, because it cometh of God, 
through the proper channel, and 
must lead the people aright and 
eventually into the presence of the 
Father, being justified by a right- 
eous life. The Lord bless vou. May 
He bless our brethren who shall 
speak, bless the interests of Zion 
and the honest in heart everywhere. 
May those upon whom responsibil- 
ity is placed, feel their responsibil- 
ity and acquit themselves as true 
servants of the Lord, to the uplift- 
ing of their fellow-men to a higher 
plane of righteousness, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 

I would like to say to the Presi- 
dents of Stakes and counselors, and 
to the Bishops and their counselors, 
who are present today, that we 
commend to their careful considera- 
tion the subjects that have been 
treated upon this afternoon by the 
brethren who have spoken — the ob- 
servance of the divine law of health 
and life, the Word of Wisdom, ab- 
stinence from folly and from the 
wild, foolish pleasure resorts that 
are being so freely patronized by 
young people in these days. I think 
that the presiding priesthood ev- 
erywhere should pay attention to 
these things, and carefullv guard 
the youth of Zion, as well as the 
middle aged and a?ed, against these 
foolish excesses. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning ! 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Charles H. Hart. 



SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, April 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ju- 
nius F. Wells. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Though deep'ning trials throng your 

way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God ! 
Ere long the resurrection day 

Will spread its life and light abroad. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Endorsement of Address to the World, 
and President Smith's statements. — 
Fruits of "Mormonism." — Encourag- 
ing condition in the Church, at home 
and abroad. — Gratitude for many 
blessings. 

I feel very thankful, this morn- 
ing, my brethren and sisters, that 
the Lord has lengthened out my 
days and permitted me once more 
to meet with you in general con- 
ference. I wish to join with our 
President in extending heartfelt 
greetings to you, my brethren and 
sisters ; and congratulate you on 
the blessings and privileges, and all 
good things we are enjoying at the 
present time. I feel very thankful 
that the Lord has been so merciful 
and kind to me personally, that he 
has lengthened out my days six- 
teen years beyond the limit that is 



attributed to man — three score and 
ten. You will agree with me when 
I say that I have much cause to be 
thankful to the Lord, for His mer- 
cies and blessings and preserving 
care. 

It is needless for me to say to 
you that I endorse the sentiments 
expressed in the document that 
was read to us yesterday morning. 
I wish to add that I also endorse 
all of the sentiments that were 
spoken by our President in his 
opening address to us. I am 
heartily in accord with everything 
he said in relation to the condition 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. In this con- 
nection, I was reminded of an ex- 
pression that was used by Presi- 
dent Taylor, when he published a 
newspaper in New York, many 
years ago, that "It is better for us 
to represent ourselves than to be 
misrepresented by others." 

Those of you who were present 
at the concert in this Tabernacle 
last evening, I think will join with 
me when I say : What a beautiful 
exhibition we had here ! Five or 
six hundred children on this stand 
singing the beautiful songs of 
Zion ! I thought of the saying of 
the Savior : "Do men gather grapes 
of thorns, or figs of thistles?" 
Then, as I gazed uoon these chil- 
dren, I thought: These are fruits 
of "Mormonism." Did you ever 
see a finer lot of children grouped 
together than you saw here last 
evening on this stand? I never 
did. It was inspiring to listen to 
their trained and beautiful voices. 
Again, as I thought of the fruits 
of "Mormonism" which are pre- 
sented here, gathered from the na-

tions of the earth ; thousands of in- 
dividuals who have obeyed the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ and have 
come to Zion. 

I congratulate my brethren and 
sisters on the success that is attend- 
ing your efforts here at home, as 
well as the brethren of the- priest- 
hood who are scattered abroad in 
the nations of the earth engaged in 
missionary labors. It is encourag- 
ing to hear and to know that pro- 
gress is being made everywhere. 
Wherever our elders are laboring, 
much good is being done, and the 
work at home is also progressing 
and thriving. I rejoice, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to be enabled to 
join with you in the events that are 
transpiring around us. I hope, if it 
be the Lord's will, that He will ex- 
tend my days a little longer, that I 
may continue to rejoice with you in 
seeing the work of the Lord pro- 
gress in the earth. 

God bless our President. I feel 
in my heart to sustain and stand by 
him ; and I am thankful to him for 
the many blessings that he has ex- 
tended towards me, and for the 
courtesies and kindnesses I have 
received and still receive from his 
hands ; and I thank you all, my 
brethren and sisters. I often won- 
der why it is that I am receiving 
so many courtesies and kindnesses 
from my brethren of the Apostles, 
and from all the Latter-day Saints 
I may say. 

I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord may continue to be poured 
out upon us. Help me O Lord, I 
pray Thee, to be faithful and true 
the remainder of my days, that, 
when I have finished my work, I 
may receive salvation in Thy king- 
dom, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 

Endorsement of the Address to the 
World. — Honesty and sincerity of the 
Saints. — Charles Dickens' tribute to 
"Mormon" emigrants. — Astounding ig- 
norance among leading people con- 
cerning "Mormonism." — Anxious to 
have our doctrines and lives investi- 
gated. — Ours an everyday religion. — 
Maxims given by a good mother to 
her son. 

My dear Brethren and Sisters, I 
am exceedingly delighted to have 
the privilege of attending this gen- 
eral conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I have listened to all that has been 
said, and I am pleased to say that it 
finds an echo in my heart, and I can 
say "Amen" to all of the sentiments 
so far expressed by the brethren 
during this conference. 

In connection with President 
Winder, I testify to you that I am 
in full accord with the sentiments of 
the Address read yesterday, and ap- 
proved by this conference. 

I hope that, for the few minutes 
I stand before you, I will be di- 
rected and guided in what I shall 
say by that same kind, charitable 
spirit manifest in the remarks of 
the previous speakers. 

There is no place on this earth so 
dear to me as our blessed State of 
Utah, and there are no people I love 
so well. I am proud of the fact 
that I am a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I am also proud that I was born of 
goodly parents, and I thank God 
every day of my life that I was born 
a member of His Church. I hope 
and trust that our aim and desires 
are to live as worthy and consistent 
members of the Church, and that 
we will be true and loyal to every 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



principle revealed in this last clay 
and dispensation. 

I love honesty and sincerity, and 
I believe no other people on earth 
are as sincere in their belief and 
faith as are the Latter-day Saints. 
They are honest in their business 
and in their religion ; they say what 
they mean, and mean what they say. 
When it is "Yes," it is "Yes;" 
when it is "No," it is "No." They 
are void of hypocrisy so common in 
the world. I thank God that this 
people, as a whole, are true and 
loyal to their faith and to God's will 
concerning them. 

In the Address delivered yester- 
day the sentiment was expressed 
that we are hoping for an enlight- 
ened investigation of what the 
world calls "Mormonism." My 
brethren and sisters, I hope to see 
the day — and God grant that it be 
an early one, too — when a just and 
unprejudiced investigation will be 
made of all the principles of the 
Gospel, and the lives of the Latter- 
day Saints. Never has there been 
an investigation of any sort calling 
in question the principles of the 
Gospel or the lives of the Latter-day 
Saints that has not proved an ad- 
vantage to us as a people, and we 
have been and will be the gainers 
thereby. I know in my heart that 
if the enlightened men of this world 
will take time to inquire into real 
"Mormonism," what the fruits of 
it are, half our great battle in this 
world will be won. 

Last night I picked up one of 
Dickens' works, and after reading 
the article written by him regarding 
his visit to an immigrant ship, I 
thought to myself how many men 
are laboring under the same misap- 
prehension and predisposition re- 
specting the "Mormon" people as 
was Charles Dickens, the great 



English novelist and writer, before 
he had made a personal investiga- 
tion. He thought that "Mormon- 
ism" was taking from the shores of 
England only the scum of the land 
— the ignorant class. The article 
referred to tells the object of his 
visit and what he found, and how 
utterly astonished he was in finding 
just the opposite of what he ex- 
pected. He visited the emigrant 
ship named "Amazon," — perhaps 
there are people in this congregation 
who crossed the ocean in that ship 
— and this is what he says : 

"My emigrant ship lies broadside on 
to the wharf. Two great gangways 
made of spars and planks connect her 
with the wharf ; and up and down these 
gangways, perpetually crowding in and 
out, to and fro, like ants, are the emi- 
grants who are going to sail in my emi- 
grant ship I go out on the 

poop-deck for air, and surveying the 
emigrants on the deck below (indeed 
they are crowded all about me, up there 
too) find more pens and inkstands in 
action, and more papers, and intermin- 
able complication respecting accounts 
with individuals for tin cans and what 
not. But nobody is in an ill temper, no- 
body is the worse for drink, nobody 
swears an oath or uses a coarse word, 
nobody appears depressed, nobody is 
weeping; and down upon the deck, in 
every corner where it is possible to find 
a few square feet to kneel, crouch, or lie 
in, people in every unsuitable attitude for 
writing, are writing letters. 

"Now, I have seen emigrant ships be- 
fore this day in June. And these people 
are so strikingly different from all other 
people in like circumstances whom I 
have ever seen, that I wonder aloud, 
'What would a stranger suppose these 
emigrants to be ! 

"The vigilant bright face of the weath- 
er-browned captain of the Amazon is at 
my shoulder, and he says : 'What, in- 
deed ! The most of these came aboard 
yesterday evening. They came from 
various parts of England in small par- 
ties that had never seen one another be- 
fore. Yet they had not been a couple of 
hours on board when they established

their own police, made their own regula- 
tions, and set their own watches at all 
the hatchways. Before nine o'clock the 
ship was as orderly and as quiet as a 
man-of-war !' 

"Later in the day, when this self-same 
boat was filled with a choir, who sang 
glees and catches for a long time, one of 
the singers, a girl, sang her part me- 
chanically all the while, and wrote a let- 
ter in the bottom of the boat while doing 
so. 

" 'A stranger would be puzzled to 
guess the right name for these people, 
Mr. Uncommercial,' says the captain. 

" 'Indeed he would. 

" 'If you hadn't known, could you ever 
have supposed — ?' 

" 'How could I ! I should have said 
they were, in their degree, the pick and 
flower of England.' 

" 'So should I,' says the captain. 

"'How many are they?' 

" 'Eight hundred, in round numbers,' — 

" 'Eight hundred what? Geese, villian?' 
Eight hundred Mormons. I, Uncom- 
mercial traveler for the firm of Human 
Interest Brothers, had come aboard this 
emigrant ship to see what eight hundred 
Latter-day Saints were like ! And I 
found them (to the rout and overthrow 
of my expectations) like what I now 
describe with scrupulous exactness." 

In closing the article the great 
novelist says this : 

"What is in store for the poor people 
on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, 
what happy delusion they are laboring 
under now, on what miserable blindness 
their eyes may be opened then, I do not 
pretend to say. But I went on board 
their ship to testify against them if they 
deserved it, as I fully believed they 
would; to my great astonishment they 
did not deserve it; and my predisposi- 
tions and tendencies must not affect me 
as an honest witness. I went over the 
Amazon's side feeling it impossible to 
deny that, so far, some remarkable in- 
fluence had produced a remarkable re- 
sult, which better known influences have 
often missed." 

My brethren and sisters, all I 
want in this world, as a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ, is for 



intelligent men to honestly investi- 
gate the lives, the character and the 
faith of the Latter-day Saints. Are 
we gaining ground? Certainly we 
are. There is hardly a stranger that 
comes into this building and hears 
the organ — the sweetest toned one 
in the world — who is not favorably 
impressed. There is no visitor that 
attends our services and listens to 
our choir who does not question the 
absurd stories told of us. I have 
met thousands of strangers who 
have expressed to me the pleasure 
they had in meeting members of the 
Church connected with the Bureau 
of Information, and said that their 
ideas of "Mormonism" had thereby 
been completely changed. I have 
been dumbfounded in meeting hun- 
dreds and thousands of leading men 
and women of this country to find 
that they knew absolutely nothing 
of our beliefs and aims, and were 
ignorant as to what we have ac- 
complished in the past and what we 
were now doing as a people. Thank 
God, I have had the privilege of 
bearing testimony to hundreds con- 
cerning your honesty, your virtues, 
your hopes and aims in life. Many 
have said to me that they were de- 
lighted to learn the truth respecting 
the Latter-day Saints. I have met 
hundreds of leading women of the 
country, and after I had talked with 
them for ten or fifteen minutes, 
about the first thing they would say 
to me would be, "Why, Senator 
Smoot, I signed the petition asking 
your expulsion from the United 
States Senate, because I believed 
the stories published and told 
against you and the Mormon 
Church." But they have been hon- 
est enough to say that from that 
moment they would try to undo all 
that they had attemoted to accom- 
plish against me, and in the future 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



would guard against such unjust 
imposition. 

My brethren and sisters, I believe 
I can recognize the hand of God in 
directing the thought of the best 
people of this country favorably to- 
ward the beliefs and lives of the 
Mormon people. God grant that 
future investigations may be hon- 
est and enlightened. If they are we 
will come out of them far advanced, 
and be recognized as an industrious, 
honest, and God-fearing people. In- 
stead of holding the theory that we 
want no one to know what our lives, 
our aims, our ambitions, and our 
doctrines are, we desire the very 
opposite, and want all people, from 
one end of the world to the other, 
to understand that we desire them 
to know us. 

I am not ashamed of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, nor am I ashamed 
of the fruits of "Mormonism." 
Compared with other people, intel- 
lectually, the Mormon people stand 
almost at the top, according to sta- 
tistics. Only three States in the 
Union have a higher percentage 
than Utah; and, mind you, their 
lareer percentage is so small that it 
is hardly noticeable. Talk about the 
Mormon people not believing in ed- 
ucation ! I say, without fear of suc- 
cessful contradiction, that we be- 
lieve in it with all our souls. We 
are spending a great proportion of 
the tithes in educating our sons and 
daughters with a view to making 
them honorable men and women, 
worthy members of the Church, and 
stalwart citizens of this great coun- 
try in which we live. 

Some of the thinking men of this 
country have come to the conclusion 
that there is something out of bal- 
ance in modern Christianity. Just 
the other day I clipped from the 
"Saturday Evening Post" an arti- 



cle which was headed "A Weekday 
Religion." It says : 

"There is a general feeling that the 
world needs a new wave of religious 
feeling that shall chasten the material- 
ism of the rich and reconcile the poor 
to their lot. It is hard to tell whether 
the churches have lost their hold alto- 
gether upon the people today. The evi- 
dence is confusing and partial. But it 
is obviously true that the world never 
mere needed genuine religious convic- 
tion to restrain its passions and r«.'i5e 
its ideals. When the new religion 
comes, or the old faith is re-shaped to 
meet the modern needs, one thing is ab- 
solutely certain : it must be a religion 
that shall deal with men actively six 
days out of the seven, instead of attend- 
ing to them only one day." 

I will not take time to read the 
balance of the article. I say to you 
that the world will have to learr. 
that a religion that is worth consid- 
ering at all must be a religion that 
governs each individual seven days 
in every week, and not merely a part 
of one day weekly. We hold to 
that view as a Church, and, there- 
fore, we are sometimes criticised. 
Some people complain that our re- 
ligion interferes with the temporal 
affairs of life. I would not give a 
cent for a religion that was not a 
part of, and did not affect, the tem- 
poral life of every adherent. God 
so intended it. That is the kind of 
religion He has had in every dis- 
pensation from the beginning until 
the present — a religion that appeals 
to man every day in the week, and 
every hour in the dav. 

I notice, my brethren and sisters, 
time is rapidly passing. I had a 
number of things I wanted to say 
to the young people, but the time al- 
lotted to me has gone. However, 
there are a few things I want to 
now present to the Latter-dav 
Saints. I ask you to consider them 
as suggestions and each sueeestion

a sermon. I hope you will remem- 
ber them. 

While sitting at home last eve- 
ning I was thinking of some of the 
things my mother used to impress 
upon me with the request that I 
make them a part of my life. I 
jotted some of them down, and I 
want to read them to you today. 
They are as follows : 

"Pray to your heavenly Father for His 
guidance and blessing, and with His love 
in your heart, rely upon your own 
strength of body and soul. 

"Take for your motto, Faith in God, 
self-reliance, honesty and industry. 

"Inscribe in the most conspicuous place 
in your home, 'Luck is a fool, pluck is a 
hero.' " 

Let me call your attention partic- 
ularly to this last saying, because 
there is a fever of speculation rag- 
ing among the people, especially in 
mining stocks, and they are relying 
upon luck rather than upon the 
strength of their own brawn and 
brain. 

"Be careful from what source you 
take your advice, and remember that 
the great art of commanding is to as- 
sume a large share of the work. 

"Rise above the envious and w;lful 
liars. 

"Place your ambitions, your aims in 
life away above the goal you intend to 
reach. 

"Remember that energy, indomitable 
determination, with a proper incentive, 
are the levers that move the world. 

"Don't drink intoxicating liquors. 
Don't chew. Don't smoke. Keep the 
Word of Wisdom. Don't swear. Don't 
read trashy books, and save your time 
and peace of mind by paying no atten- 
tion to vicious and lying newspapers. 

"Be in earnest. Be generous. Be 
civil. Love your God and fellow-men. 

"Love truth and virtue. Love your 
country and pray for its success. 

"Be strong. We are not here to play, 
to dream, to drift; we have hard work 
to do, and loads to lift : shun not the 
struggle; face it; 'tis God's gift' 



" 'Be strong : say not "The days are 
evil; who's to blame?' and fold the 
hands and acquiesce. Oh, shame : stand 
up, speak out and bravely, in God's 
name!'" 

My brethren and sisters, I hope 
and pray that the spirit of God will 
be in your hearts. I want to leave 
my testimony with you this day 
that God lives, and that Jesus is the 
Christ. I also leave my testimony 
with you that God is at the helm of 
the ship Zion, and He will never al- 
low it to run upon the rocks, but 
will protect and guide it. The mis- 
sion that was placed upon the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, of establish- 
ing the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints in this last dis- 
pensation, never more to be thrown 
down or given to another people, 
will succeed. Let us all be humble, 
and live in such a manner that our 
conduct will be worthy of emula- 
tion. God give us strength to do 
this, that our influence may be felt 
from one end of the world to the 
other. May our young people be 
pure in heart and pure in their 
lives, live according to the laws of 
God and receive His blessings ; 
which I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Brother William D. Phillips ren- 
dered a tenor solo, entitled "The 
Perfect Life." 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Unusual musical talent among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. — Character of commu- 
nity indicated by their popular songs. 
— Sublime themes of hymns sung by 
Latter-day Saints. 

Brethren and sisters : The Lat- 
ter-day Saints are not only studious, 
thoughtful, and reverent, but they 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



are also a musical people. In evi- 
dence of this, like my brother who 
has just preceded me, I point to this 
great organ, which is an outward 
symbol that speaks in tones of elo- 
quence of our love of music. I 
point to the congregational hymns 
of praise that ascend during these 
conference times from the Taber- 
nacle of the Lord, the influence of 
which I am sure must penetrate into 
the heavens. I point to the Taber- 
nacle Choir, which, under the cap- 
able leadershio of Brother Evan 
Stephens as conductor, and Brother 
John J. McClellan as organist, have 
accomplished great achievements 
within our knowledge. I point to 
the numerous choirs in the 700 
wards of the Church, some of which 
have greatly distinguished them- 
selves. The members of the Tab- 
ernacle Choir, especially, in concert 
and upon the Sabbath day. and also 
at the general Conference, have cap- 
tivated and charmed the Latter-day 
Saints by their splendid work; and 
you will remember that the Taber- 
nacle Choir appeared in competi- 
tion with other choirs before the na- 
tions of the earth, at the World's 
Fair. While they did not receive the 
first prize, yet in the estimation of 
very many people, strangers as well 
as friends, they were entitled to it; 
but our Choir did win the second 
prize, and surely that was sufficient 
honor to satisfy the most ambitious 
of choirs or choir-leaders, and will 
give them influence and prestige 
that will attach to them to the lat- 
est generation. It seemed that the 
world could not concede the first 
prize to the "Mormon" singers, and 
consequently there was a great com- 
bination effected, consisting of the 
very best and choicest choral sing- 
ers of Wales and the United States, 
to defeat this purpose, which was 



all very proper, I suppose, but we 
feel highly honored in the victory 
won by the Choir. 

I want to say to you that I be- 
lieve we are most profoundly in- 
fluenced by the songs which we 
sing. Some writer has said, in sub- 
stance, that if you will show me 
the songs which a people or a com- 
munity sing, then I will tell you the 
character of that community. There 
is much truth in this statement. I 
hold before you a book which is en- 
titled : "Sacred Hymns and Spir- 
itual Songs," for the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-dav Saints," 
and I declare that this is one of 
the most remarkable books in the 
literature of the Latter-day Saints. 
It comprises 460 hymns, about sev- 
enty of which treat upon five great 
and important themes, and they are 
as familiar to the Latter-day Saints 
as the A B Cs. The themes to 
which I allude are as follows : 

Jesus Christ, the Lord; Joseph 
Smith, His prophet; the Book of 
Mormon; the founding of Zion; 
and the Millennium. 

Jesus, the Christ. We believe 
that He was and is the Son of the 
living God — not in some mysterious, 
unaccountable way, but naturally. 
We believe that we are the chil- 
dren of God, and that Jesus is our 
elder brother ; and we are confirmed 
in this belief, because the Father 
and the Son appeared to the youth- 
ful prophet, Joseph Smith, and the 
Father said : "This is my beloved 
Son; hear Him." Surely, we 
should sing of the Lord. You will 
find in the hymn book eleven great 
hymns treating upon His life and 
labors, His suffering, and death, 
and his resurrection. Let me call 
you attention to them only to re- 
mind you how familiar the Latter- 
day Saints are with these beautiful 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON.

hymns of praise. The first two 
lines of each are as follows : 

"Jesus, once of humble birth, 
Now in glory comes to earth." 

"Come, O Thou King of kings, 
We've waited long for Thee." 

"Redeemer of Israel, 
Our only delight." 

"A poor wayfaring man of grief, 
Hath often crossed me on the way." 

"Glory to God on high, 
Let heaven and earth reply." 

"Arise, my soul, arise, 
Shake off thy guilty fears." 

"He died ! the Great Redeemer died, 
And Israel's daughters wept around." 

"I know that my Redeemer lives; 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives !" 

"Behold the great Redeemer comes 
To bring His ransomed people home." 

"Behold the great Redeemer die, 
A broken law to satisfy." 

"How great the wisdom and the love 
That filled the courts on high." 

The Lord never works in a di- 
rect way, by revelation, or word 
of mouth, among the people of the 
earth, except He has a prophet, a 
man who holds the keys of author- 
ity to officiate in the ordinances of 
the Gospel, who possesses the seal- 
ing power, to seal on earth and it 
shall be sealed in the heavens, to 
loose on earth and it shall be loosed 
in the heavens, to remit sin on 
earth and it is remitted in the heav- 
ens. Such a prophet was Joseph 
Smith, and he stands at the head of 
this great, last dispensation. Surely 
in our songs of praise and thanks- 
giving we shall soeak of the mur- 
dered prophet, the man who, with 
his brother, laid down his life for 



the testimony of Jesus, and for the 
founding and establishing of this 
great work. You will find in the 
hymn book six notable songs that 
refer to the Prophet and which are 
perfectly familiar to the Latter-day 
Saints, and are sung upon fre- 
quent occasions : 

"Our God, we raise to Thee, 
Thanks for Thy blessings free." 

"Come listen to a prophet's voice 
And hear the word of God." 

"We thank Thee, O God, for a prophet 
To guide us in these latter days." 

"Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah, 

Jesus anointed that 'Prophet and Seer.' " 

"The Seer, the Seer, Joseph the Seer, 
I'll sing of the prophet ever dear." 

"O give me back my Prophet dear, 
And Patriarch, O give them back," 

I have sometimes thought that 
the fame of Isaiah, the prophet, 
rests largely upon his predictions 
concerning the coming forth of the 
Book of Mormon and those relat- 
ing to Zion. In speaking of this 
remarkable book, the ancient proph- 
et says that "It whispers from the 
dust," whispers of a people long ex- 
tinct, and "The truth springs from 
the earth." Is it not so? This 
wonderful book embraces the ful- 
ness of the Everlasting Gospel. It 
harmonizes in principle and doctrine 
with the Holy Bible, and instead of 
weakening strengthens it, and cer- 
tifies to the glorious truths set forth 
therein. Surely we will sing of the 
Book of Mormon. You will find 
in this hymn book five splendid 
songs respecting the Book of Mor- 
mon, the first lines of which are as 
follows :

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"What was witnessed in the heavens? 
Why, an angel, earthward bound." 

"Hark! ye mortals. Hist! be still. 
Voices from Cumorah's hill." 

"An angel from on high 

The long, long silence broke." 

"The happy day has rolled on, 

The truth restored is now made known." 

"Go, ye messengers of glory ; 
Run, ye legates of the skies." 

Great and glorious were the pre- 
dictions of Isaiah, concerning the 
founding of Zion. In one place he 
says : "And it shall come to pass 
in the last days, that the mountain 
of the Lord's house shall be estab- 
lished in the top of the mountains, 
and shall be exalted above the hills ; 
and all nations shall flow unto it. 
And many people shall go and say : 
Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house 
of the God of Jacob; and He will 
teach us of His ways, and we will 
walk in His paths ; for out of Zion 
shall go forth the law, and the word 
of the Lord from Jerusalem." And 
in another place the prophet says: 
"Fear not, for I am with thee. I 
will bring thy seed from the east, 
and gather them from the West ; 
and I will say to the North: Give 
up, and to the South : Keep not 
back ; and I will bring your sons 
from afar, and your daughters from 
the ends of the earth, even all who 
bear the name of the Lord." O, 
what a glorious theme is this, Zion 
of the latter-days! Shall we not 
celebrate such a great subject -in 
praise, and in thanksgiving? It is 
done. You will find in the hymn 
book 26 inspired songs respecting 
Zion, too many to be read upon this 
occasion, but I will name a few that 
are most prominent among them. 
These are familiar to us all, and 



will immortalize the writers who 
penned them under the inspiration 
of the Almighty : 

"The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 
Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled." 

I hardly need to go further, this 
is a text in itself. 

"Glorious things of thee are spoken, 
Zion, city of our God." 

"On the mountain's top appearing, 
Lo, the sacred herald stands." 

"Zion stands with hills surrounded— 
Zion, kept by power divine." 

"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor 

labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way." 

"The Spirit of God like a fire is burning ! 
The latter-day glory begins to come 
forth." 

"O, ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free." 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us 
refer for a moment to the fifth great 
theme. We are passing through 
trying times which are testing the 
souls of men. There are thunder- 
ings and lightnings, and vapors 
of smoke, and earthquakes, and the 
sea heaving itself beyond its 
bounds. There is commotion in the 
midst of the nations, and men's 
hearts are failing them for fear. 
These things will all pass away. 
Latter-day Saints ! Hold on to the 
faith ; be firm ; be patient ; be stead- 
fast; be true to the cause; be true 
to Zion. 

Surely we will sing of the great 
Millennium. You will find herein 
five songs which emphasize in a 
very striking manner the opening 
of a thousand years of peace and 
rest : 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

"Softly beams the sacred dawning 
Of the great Millennial morn." 

"Come let us anew our journey pursue, 
Roll round with the year." 

"Let us pray, gladly pray, 
In the house of Jehovah." 

"Now let us rejoice in 'the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth need we 
roam." 

"Sons of Michael, He approaches ! 
Rise, the Eternal Father greet." 

And the glorious hymn that was 
sung this morning : 

"Though deep'ning trials throng your 
way, 

Press on, press on, ye Saints of God !" 

And there are some miscellaneous 
songs in the hymn book which are 
worthy of mention, and worthy of 
our profound consideration. They 
set forth some of the most glorious 
truths that have been given to the 
Latter-day Saints. Let me remind 
you of : 

"O my Father, Thou that dwellest 
In the high and glorious place." 

"God moves in a mysterious way 
His wonders to perform." 

"Should you feel inclined to censure, 
Faults you may in others view." 

"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
Unuttered or expressed." 

"School thy feelings, O my brother, 
Train thy warm impulsive soul." 

"Do what is right; let the consequence 
follow." 

"O say, what is Truth?" 

And last but not least : 

"My country, 'tis of thee, 
Sweet land of liberty, 
Of thee I sing." 



It seems to me — to use a strong 
expression — that the atmosphere of 
our mountain home is charged and 
surcharged with the spirit of mel- 
ody. Is it any wonder that the great 
prophet of former times should pro- 
claim: "For the Lord shall com- 
fort Zion; He will comfort all her 
waste places ; and He will make her 
wilderness like Eden, and her des- 
ert like the garden of the Lord ; 
joy and gladness shall be found 
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice 
of melody." 

May the Lord bless us. May His 
peace be upon the congregations of 
Isarel. May His choicest blessings 
rest upon our President and his 
counselors. This is my prayer, and 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Commendation of labors of Elders Ly- 
man and Penrose. — Endorsement of 
truths advocated by other speakers. — 
Three vitally important questions, and 
answers thereto. 

I would have been happier had it 
fallen to my lot to have more than 
eighteen minutes to talk to you ; but 
as the people in this city are inclined 
to criticise anybody who talks in 
meeting beyond four o'clock, unless 
I forget myself, for the first time 
in this Tabernacle, I shall stop at 
four o'clock — I mean at twelve 
o'clock. I have forgotten myself 
already, you see. If I were in Ari- 
zona, or Mexico, or Canada, or 
some place other than Salt Lake, I 
would feel at perfect liberty to talk 
ten or fifteen minutes beyond the 
time, and not expect to be censured 
bv the Saints. We have so much 
good preaching and so much good 
singing here that we apparently get 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tired of it. I notice that some times 
when the Tabernacle choir gives a 
concert very few people attend; I 
sunoose they hear the choir so often 
for nothinf that they do not care to 
pay for the privilege. 

After an absence of three years 
and a half, I rejoice to return to 
my mountain home. I rejoice in the 
progress of the work of God at 
home or abroad. I wish to say to 
fathers and mothers who have sons 
in the Eurooean Mission that they 
are doing their duty, they are boys 
to be proud of. 

While in Japan, I prayed to the 
Lord with all my heart, in the 
woods of that countrv. that I might 
be permitted to succeed Brother 
Lyman as the President of the Eu- 
ropean Mission. And why? Be- 
cause I knew from my experience 
in following him in the Tooele 
Stake of Zion that he would have all 
the holes filled up, the bridges made, 
and the roads in good condition. I 
knew that I would find the Mission 
well organized and everything in 
fine shape, with a good foundation 
upon which to build. I built upon 
that foundation, and the young mis- 
sionaries seconded my efforts there. 
God blessed us in our labors, and 
there was an increase of our Church 
work in that land during my ad- 
ministration. I feel that there will 
be still greater increase under the 
administration of Brother Penrose, 
because of the foundation laid by 
Brother Lyman, seconded by my 
efforts. When people sav that the 
Latter-day Saints do not believe in 
education and investigation, they 
simply tell that which is not true. 
Last year, in the British Isles alone, 
over four million tracts were dis- 
tributed by the elders, and those 
tracts were principally written by 
Elder Charles W. Penrose. 



In ability to expound the Scrip- 
tures, Brother Penrose has that 
qualification pre-eminently. I once 
heard a man talking with Rev. Dr. 
Iliff on the railway train. (They 
did not know I was in the seat be- 
hind.) This man said to Iliff that 
he had heard nearly every great 
preacher in the United States, but 
that when he was in Salt Lake City 
he had heard in the Mormon Taber- 
nacle the best and most logical ser- 
mon he had ever listened to. He 
asked Dr. Iliff, "Who is your great 
Mormon preacher out there?" 
Iliff said he didn't know any great 
Mormon preacher. "Why," said the 
man, "you must know that man; 
there could not be another one like 
him." "Well," replied Iliff," I 
don't know who you mean." "Well, 
who edits the Mormon paper out 
there?" "Oh! that's Penrose," 
said Iliff. "That's the fellow," said 
the man ; "he preached the best and 
most logical sermon I ever heard in 
my life." Thin as I am, that put 
fat on my ribs ; but it seemed to 
kill off Iliff. It was like pouring 
a bucket of cold water on his head, 
and he moved away from the man ; 
he didn't want any more of it. This 
man who preaches such a fine ser- 
mon is today President of the Eu- 
ropean Mission. I tell you that, 
with all the intelligence in the Brit- 
ish Isles, there is no man there who, 
with the Bible as the standard, can 
confute Brother Penrose. We are 
not ashamed of our religion. We 
know the Gosoel of Jesus Christ is 
true. We have set our light so that 
it can be seen of all men. 

I call your attention to a little 
tract written by President Hugh J. 
Cannon, entitled, "Whv." It gives 
reasons why our voung men with- 
out college education, with little ex- 
perience, and without polemic train - 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

ing, can meet the wisest and best 
informed and cause many of them 
to lay down their sectarian minis- 
try and embrace the principles of 
truth and salvation, as taught by the 
Latter-day Saints. They are suc- 
cessful because we have the truth, 
and the divinity of the work in 
which we are engaged is beyond 
question. 

I endorse with all my heart every 
word that is in the declaration to 
the world that was read here yester- 
day. I endorse the remarks made 
by. our President and by all the 
other speakers. I want to endorse 
the Word of Wisdom. I have been 
in only two or three Stakes since 
I have been home, and the Presi- 
dents of those Stakes have told me 
that there is an increased sale of tea, 
coffee and tobacco among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. In our social gath- 
erings, too many of the people, 
some holding official positions, 
drink tea or coffee. Therefore, I 
endorse all that I heard yesterday 
on the Word of Wisdom before I 
withdrew to attend a funeral. I un- 
derstand there was more said after- 
ward, and I endorse that, too. I 
heard of one of the brethren who 
was awakened from sleep at the 
close of a sermon, and he* got up 
and bore testimony to the truth of 
what had been said. He was asked 
how he could do it, and he replied : 
"Because I know the speaker would 
not say anything that was not true." 
So I bear testimony to all that was 
said here yesterday by the servants 
of the Lord on the Word of Wis- 
dom, including that which was said 
after I left. It is a law of God; 
President Brigham Young declared 
it to be such, therefore, we are 
breaking one of the commandments 
of God if we fail to obey the Word 
of Wisdom. 



I want to endorse what Charles 
Dickens wrote, that was read here 
today by Brother Reed Smoot. 
Wherever the Latter-day Saints go 
proclaiming this Gosoel, it is the 
pick and the flower of the people 
that embrace it. It is honest men 
and women who embrace the truth ; 
and when they hear the word of 
God they rejoice in their souls. They 
are full of integrity, and they show 
their integrity by sacrificing, if need 
be, for the advancement of this 
cause. 

I endorse all the good things said 
here by Brother Clawson regarding 
the songs of Zion. God Himself 
said, in a revelation to Emma 
Smith, who was given the mission 
to choose the hymns that would be 
acceptable to Him, that His soul de- 
lighted in the song of the heart ; 
"yea, the song of the righteous is a 
prayer unto me, and it shall be an- 
swered in blessing upon their 
heads." I hone that when the next 
psalmody is published they will be 
able to find room enough in it to 
put in the fourth verse of many of 
our best hymns. One of the finest 
hymns we have is one of those that 
Brother Clawson referred to, 
"Come, come, ye Saints !" It is mv 
favorite. When I think of the trav- 
els of our fathers and mothers ; 
when I think of their singing that 
song, many of them laying down 
their lives in the spirit of the words, 
"And should we die before our 
journey's through, Happy day, all 
is well !" — when I realize their in- 
tegrity and devotion, I pray God to 
make us worthy of such fathers and 
mothers as those who sang this 
song from their hearts, for many of 
them did lay down their lives be- 
fore their journey was through. I 
endorse all the good thiners that 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have been said during- this Confer- 
ence. 

I want to read here something 
from a book written by ' one of 
America's foremost statesmen, 
which I had the pleasure of read- 
ing- in nearly all the conferences of 
England : 

"A few years ago a certain man, with 
good opportunities for the investigation 
and a probability of sincere answers, 
asked every young preacher whom he 
met during a summer vacation these 
questions : 

"First, Yes or no, do you believe in 
God, the Father; God a person, God a 
definite and tangible intelligence— not a 
congeries of laws floating like a fog 
through the universe; but God a person 
in whose image vou were made? Don't 
argue; don't explain; but is -"our mind 
in a condition where you can answer 
yes or no? 

"Not a man answered Yes. Each man 
wanted to explain that the Deity might 
be a definite intelligence or might not; 
that the 'latest thought' was much con- 
fused upon the matter, and so forth 
and so on. 

"Second, Yes or no, do you believe 
that Christ was the Son of the living 
God, sent by Him to save the world? I 
am not asking whether you believe that 
He was inspired in the sense that the 
great moral teachers are inspired — no- 
body has any difficulty about that. But 
do you believe that Christ was God'3 
very Son, with a divinely appointed and 
definite mission, dying on the cross and 
raised from the dead — yes or no? 

"Again not a single answer with an 
unequivocal, earnest Yes. But again ex- 
planations were offered and in at least 
half the instances the sum of most of 
the answers was that Christ was the 
most perfect man that the world had 
seen and humanity's greatest moral 
teacher. 

"Third, Do you believe that when you 
die you will live again as a conscious, 
intelligence, knowing who you are and 
who other people are? 

"Again, not one answer was uncon- 
ditionally affirmative. 'Of course they 
were not sure as a matter of knowledge.' 
'Of course that could not be known pos- 
itively.' 'On the whole, thev were in- 
clined to think so, but there were very- 



stubborn objections,' and so forth and so 
on. 

"The men to whom these questions 
were put were particularly high-grade 
ministers. One of them had already 
won a distinguished reputation in New 
York and the New England states for 
his eloquence and piety. Every one of 
them had had unusual successes with 
fashionable congregations. 

"But every one of them had noted an 
absence of real influence upon the hearts 
of their hearers and all thought that 
this same condition is spreading 
throughout the modern pulpit. 

"Yet not one of them suspected that 
the profound cause of what they- called 
'the decay of faith' was, not in the world 
of men and women, but in themselves. 
How could such priests of ice warm the 
souls of men? How could such apos- 
tles of interrogation convert a world?" 

What are the answers of every 
Latter-day Saint who goes out to 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
to these questions? The answers 
are Yes! Yes! Yes! without a mo- 
ment's hesitation. And the same 
answers will be given by each ten- 
year-old child in any of our Sab- 
bath schools. We believe in God 
the Father. We believe in Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, with a di- 
vinely-appointed mission, the Sa- 
vior of the world. We believe that 
we shall exist eternally, and that 
we shall have a conscious knowl- 
edge of ourselves, and of others. 
We are married for time and for 
all eternity. We have God's truth 
to give to the world. We court the 
light of day; we court investiga- 
tion. We say to all the world, God 
lives, and we are made in His im- 
age. We say to all the world, 
Jesus is the Christ, and we know it 
We say to all the world, Joseph 
Smith was God's prophet. I bear 
my testimony that I know that God 
lives, that I know that Jesus is the 
Christ, that I know that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God. God 
bless you all. Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Important interrogations. — Emphatic re- 
sponse. 

I want to give this congregation 
the opportunity of answering yes 
or no to the questions that have 
been read by Brother Heber J. 
Grant, namelv : 

"First, Yes or no, do you believe in 
God, the Father ; God a person, God a 
definite and tangible intelligence — not a 
congeries of laws floating like a fog 
through the universe ; but God a person 
in whose image you were made? Don't 
argue; don't explain; but is your mind 
in a condition where you can answer 
yes or no? 

"Second, Yes or no, do you believe 
that Christ was the son of the living 
God, sent by Him to save the world? 
I am not asking whether you believe 
that He was inspired in the sense that 
the great moral teachers are inspired — 
nobody has any difficulty about that. But 
do you believe that Christ was God's 
very Son, with a divinely appointed and 
definite mission, dying on the cross and 
raised from the dead — yes or no? 

"Third, Do you believe that when you 
die you will live again as a conscious 
intelligence, knowing who you are and 
who other people are?" 

Every man and woman in this 
congregation that can answer yes 
to these questions, say yes. (There 
was a universal response from all 
over the house.) And every one 
that bears the name of Latter-day 
Saint in this vast congregation that 
cannot say yes, let him say no. (Not 
a single response.) Brother Heber 
has told us the truth. There is no 
doubt in the minds of Latter-day 
Saints in relation to the existence 
and personage of the Lord God Al- 
mighty, who is the Father of our 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
There is no doubt in the minds of 
Latter-day Saints that Jesus is the 
Son of God, being begotten of the 



Father in the flesh. And there is 
no Latter-day Saint in all the world 
but knows as truly and as fully as 
God can impart that knowledge to 
the soul of man, that he shall live 
again after death, and that men and 
women shall be associated together 
as God has ordained and they have 
been united by His power, to dwell 
together forever and forever; and 
they shall know as they are known, 
they shall see as they are seen, and 
they shall understand as God under- 
stands ; for they are His children. 
I wanted to say this much in con- 
firmation of the faith of the Latter- 
day Saints with reference to the 
questions that have been asked here, 
and that cannot be answered by the 
sectarian world, because they have 
not the faith or the knowledge to 
answer them. Latter-day Saints can 
answer them, because God has re- 
vealed the knowledge to them in 
this day through the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, and by the testimony of 
the Spirit of God in the heart of 
every faithful Latter-day Saint. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God ; 
Thou hast made Thy children mighty, 
By the touch of the mountain sod. 

AUDITING. COMMITTEE'S REPORT. 

President Joseph F. Smith read 
the annual report of the Church 
auditing committee, as follows : 

Salt Lake City, March 20, 1907. 

President Joseph F. Smith and 
Counselors. 
Dear Brethren — We, the un- 
dersigned members of the general 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Church auditing committee, beg 
leave to report as follows : 

We have carefully examined the 
accounts of the Trustee-in-Trust, 
Presiding Bishopric, the Deseret 
News, the Latter-day Saints' hos- 
pital and other business concerns 
in which the Church is interested, 
for the year 1906. We find that 
the accounting in the various de- 
partments is properlv done; every 
dollar received has been correctly 
entered, and the disbursements un- 
der your direction have been econ- 
omically and wisely made for the 
exclusive benefit of the various in- 
terests of the Church. And we 
heartily endorse your judicious and 
conservative administration. 

The Church is to be congratulat- 
ed upon the fact that the Church 
bonds have been redeemed, that 
the Church is entirely free from 
debt and has sufficient funds on 
hand to meet 'necessary require- 
ments. 

Your brethren, 
(Signed.) Rudger Clawson, 
Reed Smoot, 
W. W. Riter, 

C. W. NlBLEY, 

A. W. Carlson, 
General Church Auditing 
Committee. 

President Anthon H. Lund mov- 
ed that the report of the auditine 
committee be accepted and approved 
by the Conference. The motion was 
seconded, and carried unanimously. 

Benediction was pronounced by- 
Bishop Orrin P. Miller. 



Afternoon Session. 

The meeting was called to order 
at 2 p. m., President Joseph F. 
Smith presiding. 



The choir sang the hymn : 

Lo ! the mighty God appearing, 
From on high Jehovah speaks ! 

Eastern lands the summons hearing, 
O'er the west His thunder breaks. 

Prayer was offered by Elder J. 
Golden Kimball. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

We're not ashamed to own our Lord, 
And worship Him on earth ; 

We love to learn His holy word, 
And know what souls are worth. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

I am very grateful, my brethren 
and sisters, for this privilege, and 
I cheerfully respond to the call 
made upon me, believing that I have, 
the confidence, the faith and the 
prayers of my brethren and sisters ; 
and I ask a continuation of these 
favors at this time, in my behalf ; 
praying that the Lord may inspire 
me to say those things that will be 
for your edification as well as mine. 

I rejoice that I have a name and 
standing in the midst of this people. 
How great you look to me this af- 
ternoon I can hardly tell you. The 
immense capacity of this building 
filled with human beings, your faces 
all turned toward the speaker, is, 
indeed, an inspiring sight. I am 
grateful to the Lord for this con- 
ference, for this grand assemblage 
of His children, for the united vote 
that you gave this morning, and in 
respect to questions on doctrinal 
points that were given you to an- 
swer this forenoon. The way they 
were answered is in strict keeping 
with the spirit of the faith you 
have adooted. When President 
Brigham Young entered the Salt 
Lake Valley in 1847, he raised him- 
self upon his elbow, in the carriage

of Brother Woodruff, where he was 
reclining, and looked over the val- 
ley, from the mouth of Emigration 
Canyon, and said : "This will do ; 
drive on, Brother Woodruff ; this 
is the place for the gathering of 
the Saints." That saying was 
prophetic, as manifest in the events 
which have transpired since that 
vision to the prophet of the Lord, 
and evidenced in the prosperity that 
has attended the people. Their 
united faith has drawn them to- 
gether in greater numbers year by 
year, and so I believe it will contin- 
ue to be. 

In relation to the document that 
was read in your hearing yesterday, 
I endorse every word of it now in 
my testimony as I did in my vote 
yesterday. I am delighted with the 
prospect, which I consider is bright- 
er today than ever before, that the 
whole world shall learn of the faith 
of this people ; and our probable fu- 
ture destiny will be studied with 
greater interest, I believe, by the 
thinking people of the world, than 
it has been heretofore. The truth 
of the old song is evidenced to me 
today: "Zion is growing; give us 
room that we may dwell." If this 
were not so, I think that some of 
us would feel very much disappoint- 
ed. The work of the Lord is des- 
tined to make progress; it means 
progression. In the common par- 
lance of the times, this work "has 
come to stay," and, having come 
with this purpose, it must grow ; it 
must extend, because it cannot stand 
still. If there is any project that 
comes to a stop, retrogression, a 
movement backward, is the natural 
condition that ensues. 

In regard to the beautiful expo- 
sition that was made this morning 
of the hymns we sins", I was de- 
lighted with the statements made by 



Brother Clawson, and the allusion 
to those hymns by Brother Grant 
and others. I was also interested 
in the reference that was made to 
the sacred purpose that the Saints 
have in their hearts, while diligently 
laboring in the stakes and wards of 
Zion. 

' My brethren and sisters, I believe 
firmly in the doctrines you have so 
honestly announced today to be 
your convictions, that the God of 
heaven lives, that He is our Father, 
the Father of our spirits, the Cre- 
ator of the universe ; that from His 
presence we have come to our 
earthly probation; that He chose 
His well beloved Son, Jesus of 
Nazareth, to be the Savior of the 
world. He was the only begotten 
of the Father. That is the stand 
we take in regard to the matter of 
relationship between God the eter- 
nal Father and His Son, Jesus 
Christ. As Brother Smoot proper- 
ly observed today: If any of our 
Sunday School children, ten years 
of age, had been in that congrega- 
tion of ministers, and had been 
asked the question : "Do you be- 
lieve in a personal God, of body, 
parts, and passions ?" every Sunday 
School child would have answered 
that they do believe in such a God. 
They have been perfectly taught in 
these matters, and so have the 
Saints, not alone by the doctrines 
of the Church, but we also endeavor 
to individually obtain a living tes 1 
timony that God lives, that His Son 
Jesus Christ lives, and that the Holy 
Ghost is a personage of spirit. We 
believe in the passage of scripture 
which gives an account of the bap- 
tism of the Savior. John was bap- 
tizing in the river Jordan, and the 
Savior came to him and asked for 
baptism, but John forbade him, say- 
ing: "I have need to be baptized

of thee, and comest thou to me ?" 
and Jesus said : "Suffer it to be so 
now, for thus it becometh us to ful- 
fill all righteousness," and so he 
suffered Him, and they went down 
into the water. As they came up 
out of the water and stood upon 
the bank of the river, a voice was 
heard from heaven, saying: "This 
is my beloved Son, in whom I am 
well pleased;" and the Holy Ghost 
descended upon Him in the sign 
of a beautiful white dove. 

In a Sunday School gathering in 
the city of New York, not long ago, 
(not a Latter-day Saints' Sunday 
School, however), a young lady 
teacher approached the minister who 
was presiding over the school, and 
asked : "How shall I teach God to 
my children — the class that I am 
teaching?" The minister replied: 
"You must teach God according to 
the intelligence of those whom you 
are teaching." The lady replied 
that this did not answer her ques- 
tion. Then the minister appealed 
to the congregation, and asked if 
there was any one present who 
would answer the question of the 
lady; and it is said that a "Mor- 
mon" elder who was present volun- 
teered this information on the sub- 
ject: He referred them to the first 
chapter of Genesis where God de- 
clares that He "created man in His 
own image, and in His own like- 
ness — male and female, created He 
them." This was in keeping with 
the teachings of Scripture, and no 
doubt satisfied the query that was 
in the mind of the lady, as no fur- 
ther questions were asked. We have 
declared in our articles of faith that 
"We believe in God the eternal 
Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ 
and in the Holy Ghost. We be- 
lieve that mankind will be punished 
for their own sins and not for 



Adam's transgression." This doc- 
trine is in perfect accord with the 
teachings of the Holy Scriptures, 
and harmonizes with the divine 
teachings given through the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith in the day and age 
in which we live. When the Savior 
was upon the earth he gave the 
promise : "If any will obey the 
doctrine that I teach he shall know 
whether it is of God, my Father, or 
whether I speak of myself. It is 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
that this people have been called to 
teach, and to exemplify in their 
lives. Although there has always 
been some opposition to the truth, 
ever since the Church was organ- 
ized, that has not, however, resulted 
in staying its progress. The Church 
of Christ, the ordinances of God's 
house, and the organizations of the 
Holy Priesthood are upon the 
earth, and they will remain until 
they have accomplished the pur- 
poses that the Lord has designed. 

It was fortunate for us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that the Church was 
organized under the protection of 
the constitution of this great gov- 
ernment. This grand constitution 
and government was established un- 
der the inspiration of Almighty God 
by our revolutionary fathers, and 
we have had the privilege of living 
under these favorable conditions, 
and becoming numerous and 
strong; and the State in which we 
live is now one of the bright stars 
in the galaxy of our national starry 
host. We are proud of the State 
of Utah; we are proud of the pro- 
ducts of Utah. We are proud of 
our boys and girls, and we are not 
afraid to compare them with any 
that the world can produce, for 
moral, physical, and intellectual 
strength. The Gospel net has gath- 
ered people from many nations of

the earth, we are therefore a cos- 
mopolitan people, and the mixture 
has produced a race of men and 
women gigantic in health and phy- 
sical powers, as well as in moral 
and intellectual development, and 
their understanding of Gospel phi- 
losophy. There was no cold, dead 
response, no myth, no shadow in 
the answers on Gospel philosophy 
that were given this morning. Every 
man and woman knew what they 
were declaring. They understood 
the questions they were answering. 
They knew in their hearts that God 
lives, and that Jesus is the Christ. 
They also know that Joseph, the 
prophet, through the inspiration of 
the Almighty, brought to pass the 
organization of the Holy Priesthood 
upon the earth; that Zion is being 
built up, and Israel is being gath- 
ered, through the efforts of that 
mighty prophet and those who have 
followed him. " 

My brethren and sisters, I pray 
the blessings of the Lord upon you. 
I testify that the Gospel is true. I 
know that my Redeemer lives. I 
know that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God, and that we are 
being led under the prophetic influ- 
ence of the Spirit of God today, by 
His servants who preside over us. 
Amen. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

The present conference has been 
to me full of the deepest interest. 
To my mind, this has been a mem- 
orable occasion, one that has made 
an impression upon the people, and 
which, I believe, will make an im- 
pression upon the world ; for, in the 
declaration of principles that has 
been adopted and approved by the 



Latter-day Saints, in conference as- 
sembled, is a plea for fair play, for 
justice. It is a plea to the world 
not to believe the misrepresenta- 
tions that have been sent out by the 
enemies of this people. It is the 
protest of a great people against 
being maligned by a world which 
has been misled by unscrupulous 
men and women. I echo the senti- 
ment expressed, that it is better to 
represent ourselves than to be mis- 
represented by others. It appeals 
to me that that is the proper thing 
for us to do. I endorse with all my 
heart the principles set forth in that 
document. They are principles that 
have been taught to me from my in- 
fancy. They are not new to the 
Latter-day Saints. It is something 
that we do not need to deliberate 
upon. The moment we heard the 
declaration of these principles every 
soul was ready and prepared to 
vote upon the proposition. They 
are principles that are dear to our 
hearts. They have been revealed 
from heaven in the dispensation in 
which we live. I also endorse and 
believe that all the good that has 
been spoken of Zion and her people 
is true. There are no better peo- 
ple upon the face of the earth than 
the Latter-day Saints, and whatever 
superiority we have attained to is 
the direct result of obedience to 
these principles which our Father 
has revealed unto us. While I be- 
lieve these things with all my heart, 
nevertheless there is danger that we 
might think we have already at- 
tained to so much excellence that 
we should stop. I wish to bear wit- 
ness that there is ample room for 
improvement among the Latter-day 
Saints, as well as in the world at 
large. 

The Gospel we have received is 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Gospel of repentance; and dur- 
ing this conference, it seems to me, 
a great deal of stress has been laid 
upon that principle. Sometimes we 
are prone to think that because we 
have yielded obedience to the prin- 
ciples of faith and repentance and 
have received baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins, we 
have no further need of repentance. 
My brethren and sisters, we have 
-daily need of this saving principle 
of repentance. It should apply to 
our daily lives. The one great rea- 
son why the world does not accept 
the message which is borne by the 
missionaries of this Church is be- 
cause they are not willing to prac- 
tice the principle of repentance. 
There seems to be a deep-seated 
feeling among people — I mean the 
higher class of people — that they 
have no need of repentance. And 
sometimes many of the Latter-day 
Saints appear to think similarly. 
The truth is, we all need repent- 
ance, day by day, in the common, 
ordinary walks of life. Repentance 
is a saving principle, and we will 
be saved through yielding obedi- 
ence to that law. We are inspired 
to it through the faith we have in 
God our Eternal Father. Without 
repentance we cannot grow spir- 
itually, we cannot advance. It is 
because we have to some degree re- 
pented and turned, away from evil 
practices and bettered our lives, 
that we can today point with pride 
to the condition of the Latter-day 
Saints as compared with other peo- 
ple in the world. Repentance is 
not simply a grieving and mourn- 
ing over sin. It is something to in- 
fluence us in every business trans- 
action, in every dealing that we 
have, in every labor we perform. 
When we arise in the morning it 



should be with a determination that 
through our faith in the Lord we 
are going to live in obedience to 
His laws and commandments, that 
we are going to apply the princi- 
ple of repentance by turning away 
from every evil deed; and if I deal 
with my brother, that dealing will 
be honest, and if I speak I will 
speak the truth. 

Some people have an idea that if 
we become so religious that we 
must take the Lord into considera- 
tion in everything we do we will be- 
come so holy and so good that no- 
body can speak to us. People say, 
"Oh, he is altogether too good," 
and he is referred to as "goody- 
goody" — as if it were possible for 
men to be too good. I recollect 
talking with a gentleman a short 
time ago, and he referred to a cer- 
tain individual as being altogether 
too good. I asked him the ques- 
tion, Is it possible for a man to be 
too good ? Oh, yes, he said ; and 
then he went on to describe a cer- 
tain individual whom he knew, say- 
ing that he was altogether too good. 
He described a man who was some- 
what fanatical, a sort of a bigot, 
a sanctimonious hypocrite, and 
called him "too good !" Why, that 
is not goodness at all. A man can- 
not be too good. Can a man be too 
honest ? No. Can a woman be too 
virtuous? No. Neither can any- 
one be too good. The trouble is, 
none of us are good enough. So 
we need to improve by a practice 
of that saving principle of repent- 
ance, that will eventually make us 
like our Heavenly Father. If we 
find that we are dealing in a way 
that our Father will not approve of, 
repent, because we are doing 
wrong; and never stop repenting 
until we can harmonize our con- 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS.

duct with the will of our Father 
in heaven. Repentance is a saving 
law. We all have weaknesses, and 
we may confess them freely; it is 
good to do so. But we must not 
glory in our weaknesses. We must 
not think it possible for us to walk 
too closely to the line. We should 
be ambitious to become better every 
day, by a practice of this principle. 
Our prayers to the Father are a 
practice in the principle of repent- 
ance. If we go before Him in the 
spirit of prayer, with broken hearts 
and contrite spirits, the spirit of 
repentance is with us. By prac- 
ticing this principle we learn to 
know ourselves; we behold our 
weaknesses because we are trying 
to overcome them, and as we be- 
come conscious of them, and have 
a desire to overcome them, we grow 
stronger day by day. 

The kingdom of God has been 
likened to a city set upon a hill, 
whose light cannot be hid. Such 
will be and is the position of the 
Latter-day Saints today. They are 
as a city set upon a hill 
whose light cannot be hid. Never 
mind the calumny that goes abroad 
in the land, never mind what peo- 
ple think of us. I am not half so 
much concerned in what they may 
think of us as in what we must 
think of ourselves, and what is the 
truth in regard to our own condi- 
tion. If we are living up to the 
laws and commandments of God, if 
we are dealing righteously one with 
another, if we are practicing the 
principles that the Lord has re- 
vealed, our light will shine, and the 
whole world will behold it. May 
the Lord help us to be always on 
the alert, always willing to improve, 
always full of the spirit of repent- 
ance, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



EIDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

Of late years it has been the cus- 
tom of the Church to publish in 
pamphlet form the proceedings of 
the annual and semi-annual confer- 
ences of the Church, and I presume 
that the present conference will be 
no exception to that rule. I take it 
for granted, therefore, that the im- 
portant document presented by the 
Presidency of the Church and ac- 
cepted by the conference in behalf 
of the Church will be published in 
the proceedings of this conference. 
It will find its way into the hands of 
the Elders who are engaged in the 
foreign ministry, and I doubt not 
but it will furnish them with very 
important data, by which they can 
meet much of the misunderstanding 
and some of the misrepresentation 
that obtains in the world concern- 
ing the work of the Lord in these 
last days. In view of this probable 
use of the document, I have it in 
mind to make a supplemental con- 
tribution, in the way of argument 
and historical illustration of some 
one or two points in it, which, while 
it may not be of so very much in- 
terest to you, may yet be of some 
use to your sons and husbands who 
are abroad in the world on missions. 

You will remember that we ex- 
press a desire in the document (and 
I say "we" advisedly; for while the 
document is signed by the Presi- 
dency of the Church, it -becomes 
"ours" by reason of the unanimous 
adoption of it in this conference) to 
live at peace with all men. We de- 
sire to live in peace and confidence 
with our fellow-citizens of all politi- 
cal parties and of all religions, 
is the hope expressed. Then 
attention is called to the fact that 
there exists a doubt as to our abil- 
ity to so live with our fellow-citi- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



zens, because we believe in revela- 
tion from God, and that a revela- 
tion may come from Him at any 
time, even as He wills, as He may 
determine, and upon whatsoever 
subject He may choose to reveal 
Himself to His Church. For the 
sake of accuracy I quote the pas- 
sage I have in mind verbatim. 

"It is sometimes urged that the per- 
manent realization of such a desire is 
impossible, since the Latter-day Saints 
hold as a principle of their faith that 
God now reveals Himself to man, as in 
ancient times ; that the priesthood of 
the Church constitute a body of men 
who have, each for himself, in the sphere 
in which he moves, special right to such 
revelation; that the President of the 
Church is recognized as the only person 
through whom divine communication 
will come as law and doctrine to the re- 
ligious body; that such revelation may 
come at any time, upon any subject, 
spiritual or temporal, as God wills ; and 
finally that, in the mind of every faith- 
ful Latter-day Saint, such revelation, in 
whatsoever it counsels, advises or com- 
mands, is paramount. Furthermore it 
is sometimes pointed out that the mem- 
bers of the Church are looking for the 
actual coming of a Kingdom of God on 
earth, that shall gather all the kingdoms 
of the world into one visible, divine em- 
pire, over which the risen Messiah shall 
reign. All this, it is held, renders it im- 
possible for a 'Mormon' to give true al- 
legiance to his country, or to any earthly 
government." 

In relation to that expressed fear 
we say : 

"We refuse to be bound by the inter- 
pretations _ which others place upon our 
beliefs, or by what they allege must be 
the practical consequences of our doc- 
trine. Men have no right to impute to 
us what they think may be the logical 
deduction from our beliefs, but which we 
ourselves do not accept. We are to oe 
judged by our own interpretations and 
by our actions, not by the logic of oth- 
ers, as to what is or may be the result of 
our faith." 

At first glance a statement of that 



kind may seem very bold and some- 
what egotistical. It is not, how- 
ever, without illustrious example 
and precedent if we need pre- 
cedent to guide our conduct, 
which, of course, we do not especi- 
ally need; still if there are illus- 
trious examples that justify such a 
position as this, there can be no 
harm in referring to them. The 
position here taken is not only the 
position of the Church of Latter- 
day Saints, but is the position also 
of the great Catholic Church. Rev. 
Dr. John Milner, a most able ex- 
ponent and defender of the Cath- 
olic faith, in his great work, "The 
End of Religious Controversy," 
published at the commencement of 
the nineteenth century, quotes with 
approval one of the early Christian 
fathers — Tertullian, of the second 
century of the Christian era — upon 
that subject, as follows. By the 
way, the Christian father is criti- 
cising the attitude of some of the 
heretics and reproving their pre- 
sumption in using the Scriptures 
against the Catholic Church, he 
says : 

"Heretics are not to be allowed to ap- 
peal to Scripture, since they have no 
claim to it. Hence it is proper to ad- 
dress them as follows: Who are you? 
Whence do you come? What business 
have you strangers with my property? 
By what right, Marcion, [one of the 
heretics against whom Tertullian was 
contending] by what right are you, Mar- 
cion, felling my trees, by what authority 
are you, Valentine [another heretic] 
turning the course of my streams? Un- 
der what pretense are you Appelles re- 
moving my land marks? The estate is 
mine. I have the ancient, the prior pos- 
session of it. I have the title deeds de- 
livered to me by the original proprietors. 
I am the heir of the apostles ; they have 
made their will in my favor ; while they 
disinherited and cast you off, as stran- 
gers and enemies." 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



47 



Dr. Milner, quoting with approv- 
al St. Vincent of Lerins (who flour- 
ished at the end of the Fifth cen- 
tury) on the question as to how the 
children of the Church were to use 
the scriptures so as to discern truth 
from falsehood, quotes the father as 
saying : 

"They are to interpret the divine text 
according to the tradition of the Cath- 
olic church." (End of Religious Contro- 
versy, Letter X.) 

Dr. Milner himself, in his con- 
troversy with Protestants (1801-2) 
says : 

"I have reminded you, that no proph- 
ecy of Scripture is of any private inter- 
pretation; and I have proved to you 
that the whole right to Scripture belongs 
to the Church. She has preserved them, 
she vouches for them, and she alone, by 
confronting the several passages with 
each other, and with tradition authori- 
tatively explains them. Hence it is im- 
possible that the real sense of Scripture 
should ever be against her and her 'doc- 
trine; and hence, of course, I might 
quash every objection which you can 
draw from any passage in it by this short 
reply: The Church understands the 
passage differently from you ; therefore 
you mistake its meaning." (End of Re- 
ligious Controversy, Letter XII.) 

So with reference to our Scrip- 
tures. The Church, and the Church 
alone, holds the right of interpreta- 
tion; and we are not bound to ac- 
cept either the interpretation or the 
logfcal deductions built thereon that 
are made by others than the Church. 

I desire now to put in the record 
another important quotation; one. 
that has a bearing on the supposed 
impossibility of our giving true al- 
legiance to government because we 
look for the coming of the kingdom 
of God. This time I quote not from 
a churchman, but from a great his- 
torian. At one time it was strongly 



doubted in England if Catholics, 
who held allegiance to the Pope, 
who regarded him as infallible as 
an interpreter of questions of faith 
and morals, and themselves sub- 
ject to his spiritual direction — it 
was doubted if Catholics were cap- 
able of genuine allegiance to the 
British government; or if the Jews, 
who looked for the coming of a 
Messiah to stand at the head of a 
great and dominating Hebrew 
state, could give such allegiance to 
Great Britain as would warrant 
their participation in her civil af- 
fairs. These principles were dis- 
cussed by Lord Macauley in his Es- 
says, and I read you an extract from 
one of them : 

"It passes for an argument to say that 
a Jew will take no interest in the pros- 
perity of the country in which he lives, 
that he will not care how bad its laws 
and police may be, how heavily it may 
be taxed, how often it may be con- 
quered and given up to spoil, because 
God has promised that, by some un- 
known means, and at some undetermined 
time, perhaps 10,000 years hence, the 
Jews shall migrate to Palestine. Is not 
this the most profound ignorance of hu- 
man nature? Do you not know that 
what is remote and indefinite affects 
men far less than what is near and cer- 
tain? The argument, too, applies to 
Christians as strongly as to Jews. The 
Christian believes, as well as the Jew, 
that at some future period the present 
order of things will come to an end. Nay, 
many Christians believe that the Mes- 
siah will shortly establish a kingdom on 
the earth, and reign visibly over all its 

inhabitants Now wherein 

does this doctrine differ, as far as its po- 
litical tendency is concerned, from the 
doctrine of the Jews? If a Jew is unfit 
to legislate for us because he believes 
that he or his remote descendants will 
be removed to Palestine, can we safely 
open the house of commons to a 'fifth 
monarchy' man, who expects that, be- 
fore this generation shall pass away, all 
the kingdoms of the earth will be swal- 
lowed up in one divine empire? 

"Does a Jew engage less eagerly than 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a Christian in any competition which 
the law leaves open to him? Is he less 
active and regular in his business than 
his neighbors? Does he furnish his 
house meanly because he is a pilgrim 
and sojourner in the land? Does the 
expectation of being restored to the 
country of his fathers make him insen- 
sible to the fluctuations of the stock ex- 
change? Does he, in arranging his pri- 
vate affairs, ever take into the account 
the chance of his migrating to Palestine ? 
If not, why are we to suppose that feel- 
ings which never influence his dealings 
as a merchant, or his dispositions as a 
testator, will acquire a boundless influ- 
ence over him as soon as he becomes a 
magistrate or a legislator. ... To 
charge men with practical consequences 
which they themselves deny, is disin- 
genuous in controversy, it is atrocious in 
government." 

Discussing the principle in hand 
still further, and with that wealth 
of illustration so characteristic of 
him, our author says : 

"The doctrine of predestination, in the 
opinion of many people, tends to make 
those who hold it utterly immoral. And 
certainly it would seem that a man who 
believes his eternal destiny to be already 
irrevocably fixed is likely to indulge his 
passions without restraint, and to neg- 
lect his religious duties. If he is an heir 
to wrath, his exertions must be unavail- 
ing. If he is preordained to life, they 
must be superfluous. But would it be 
wise to punish every man who holds the 
higher doctrines of Calvinism, as if he 
had actually committed all those crimes 
which we know some Antonomians to 
have committed? Assuredly not. The 
fact notoriously is that there are many 
Calvinists as moral in their conduct as 
any Arminian, and many Arminians as 
loose as any Calvinist. 

"It is altogether impossible to reason 
from the opinions which a man pro- 
fesses to his feelings and his actions ; 
and in fact no person is ever such a fool 
as to reason thus, except when he wants 
a pretext for persecuting his neighbors. 
A Christian is commanded, under the 
strongest sanctions, to be just in all his 
dealings ; yet to how many of the twen- 
ty-four millions of professing Christians 



in these islands would any man in his 
senses lend a thousand pounds without 
security? A man who should act, for 
one day, on the supposition that all the 
people about him were influenced by the 
religion which they professed, would 
find himself ruined before night; and 
no man ever does act on that supposi- 
tion in any of the ordinary concerns of 
life, in borrowing, in lending, in buy- 
ing, or in selling. But when any of our 
fellow-creatures are to be oppressed, the 
case is different. Then we represent 
those motives which we know to be so 
feeble for good as omnipotent for evil. 
Then we lay to the charge of our vic- 
tims all the vices and follies to which 
their doctrines, however remotely, seem 
to tend. We forget that the same weak- 
ness, the same laxity, the same disposi- 
tion to prefer the present to the future 
which makes men worse than a good re- 
ligion, makes them better than a bad 
one." 

There is one other quotation I de- 
sire to make, and this time from an 
eminent American statesman, not 
long since deceased, and I trust that 
he will for a long time live in the 
memory of the Latter-day Saints, 
cause of the evident fairness that 
he manifested in dealing with the 
questions in which the Church was 
involved in the recent investigation 
had before the Senate Committee 
on Privileges and Elections. Influ- 
enced, though perhaps unconscious- 
ly, but influenced, I believe, by the 
doctrine of Macaulay just set forth, 
Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, 
said : 

"We have no right to deal, in deter- 
mining Mr. Smoot's case, with any ar- 
ticle of religious faith of his; and I 
suppose further — now I speak only for 
myself — that I have no right to impute 
to him what I think may be the logical 
deduction from his beliefs, but which he 
himself does not accept. He is not 
obliged to be judged by my logic as to 
what is the result of his creed. That is 
the great source of all religious perse- 
cution and tyranny in this world."

Here, then, is where we stand on 
this question of the interpretation of 
our doctrines — we insist upon our 
own interpretation — we refuse 'to be 
bound by the interpretation of oth - 
ers, or by what they may consider 
logical deductions from our beliefs ; 
and in this position we are sustained 
by the example of the great Cath- 
olic Church ; by such authorities as 
Macaula^ and Senator Hoar; and, 
what is better still, by the reason- 
ableness of the thing itself. And 
now, placing our own interpreta- 
tion upon our own doctrines, "We 
deny," to use the language of the 
Address read and adopted by this 
conference — "We deny that either 
our belief in divine revelation, or 
our anticipation of the coming king - 
dom of God, weakens in any de- 
gree the genuineness of our allegi- 
ance to our country. When the di- 
vine empire will be established, we 
may not know any more than other 
Christians who pray, "Thy kino-dom 
come, Thy will be done, in earth as 
it is in heaven ;" but we do know 
that our allegiance and loyalty to 
country are strengthened by the fact 
that while awaiting the advent of 
the Messiah's kingdom, we are un- 
der a commandment from God to 
be subject to the powers that be, un- 
til He comes "whose right it is to 
reign." 

These things may not be of so 
much interest to you as some others 
would have been, but I desired to 
cet a statement of these principles 
and arguments into the record of 
this conference. May the Lord 
bless them to the good of our cause, 
is my prayer. Amen.

cred solo, "Jerusalem." 



ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

In standing up in the midst of 
this great congregation I trust I 
may be assisted by my Heavenly 
Father to say such words as shall 
be appropriate and profitable for 
you to hear. In common with my 
brethren, who have already ad- 
dressed those who have assembled 
in these conference meetings, I can 
say that my heart has been made 
happy, and I have felt in very deed 
to praise the name of my Maker, 
for giving me standing in the midst 
of the Latter-day Saints, and for 
giving me fellowship with my breth 
ren with whom I am privileged to 
labor. We believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that our Father in heaven 
has called us to the accomplishment 
of a marvelous work. We feel sat- 
isfied that we have not been led 
astray, and that we are in no way 
deluded in giving the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-dav Saints 
our allegiance. I can say as an in- 
dividual that I could not discover 
the truth of the work the world 
calls "Mormonism" through the 
teaching and persuasion and exam- 
ple of my parents alone, although 
my parents, before I was born up- 
on the earth, had been convinced of 
the truth of "Mormonism," and had 
separated themselves from their 
friends, and relatives, and country, 
for the Gospel's sake. They were 
filled with a strong desire that their 
children might have faith in that 
Gospel and system of religion that 
had brought them from a far-off 
land. I could not comnrehend the 
truth of this work merely because 
my parents had yielded obedience 
to it, notwithstanding they were 
very devout, and believed intensely 
in the truth of "Mormonism," and 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they sought by every means within 
their power to transmit to me a 
knowledge of that truth, and to im- 
press me with the fact that they had 
planted their feet in the right path. 
While I believed measurably in the 
representations they made concern- 
ing the principles of Mormonism, 
because of the honesty of their lives, 
their uprightness in every action 
and in every labor to which they 
set their hands, yet I could learn 
that Mormonism was the power of 
God unto salvation only by the rev- 
elation of that truth to me as an in- 
dividual. When I obtained that 
knowledge it came to me in the 
very same manner in which it had 
been revealed to my parents in the 
land of their birth. 

I believe there is a feeling, a con- 
scientious disposition on the part of 
the young men and women of 
"Mormondom," to hesitate in say- 
ing that they have knowledge con- 
cerning the truth of the Gospel, un- 
til every doubt has been swept away 
by the power of the Holy Ghost, 
and the knowledge has been given 
to them by the inspiration that 
comes from our Father in heaven. 
This revelation of truth to the indi- 
vidual is the secret of the strength 
of "Mormonism." It is not, as has 
been supposed and ofttimes inti- 
mated, that the ignorant of the 
world have been gathered together, 
and that presiding over them are a 
few men of great intelligence, who 
have had power to control the peo- 
ple, and to keep them in ignorance. 
Who are the men, my brethren and 
sisters, who preside in the midst of 
the Latter-day Saints today ? I can- 
not help but think and remember 
that in my life time — and when I 
consider my age in comparison with 
the age of President John R. Win- 
der, I feel that I am only a boy — 



in my recollection every man who 
occupies a prominent position in 
the counsels of the presiding au- 
thorities of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints today, 
has been brought up from the ranks 
of the people since I attained my 
majority, with the exception of 
President Joseph F. Smith alone. 
They have not come to the positions 
they occupy through any royal road, 
or because of any special prefer- 
ence for them or the names they 
bear, but because of the duties and 
labors they have faithfully accom- 
plished in assisting to build up and 
bring to pass the work of our God. 
It has fallen to my lot, just in re- 
cent years, in attending to the labors 
and responsibilities that have been 
assigned unto me in the Holy 
Priesthood, to preside over two of 
these men who stand today as Apos- 
tles of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
have directed them in missionary 
labors, and I have this testimony to 
bear concerning them : that they are 
men of humility, that they appreci- 
ated the responsibility of the Priest- 
hood that had been conferred upon 
them, and they honored that author- 
ity in the men who presided over 
them. I take it, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that if we were to study the 
history and the lives of the men who 
have been called to responsible po- 
sitions in this Church, we would 
discover that they had been anxious 
to keep the commandments of our 
Father in heaven. We would dis- 
cover that into their souls had 
dawned a knowledge of the truth 
of the glorious Gospel of the Re- 
deemer of men. We would discover 
that they have been men who, in 
the early days of their lives, have 
entered into sacred and secret cov- 
enant with our Father in heaven to 
honor Him and to keep His com-

mandments, and to assist as God 
would give them light and power, to 
bring to pass His purposes among 
the children of men. They have not 
been men who have been anxious to 
wield the sceptre of power, rather 
they have been men who were will- 
ing to take lowly positions, willing to 
accomplish and perform without 
question every labor assigned unto 
them ; because God had revealed to 
them that "Mormonism" is the 
power of God, the true religion of 
the Redeemer of men, given anew 
in this great and last dispensation, 
according to the promises of the 
holy prophets. 

God decreed long ago that His 
word, in the latter times, should be 
re-established among men, that the 
truth should go forth from nation 
to nation, that the honest among 
men should be pricked in their 
hearts by the power of God ; and 
that, by His power and His reve- 
lation, they should be brought to- 
gether from the East and from the 
West, from the North and from 
the South, to a place called "Zion," 
for the very purpose of learning 
more fully of the ways of the Lord 
and walking more perfectly in His 
path. Let us remember, my breth- 
ren and sisters,that this is the grand 
object of our being gathered togeth- 
er. I pray that it may be fully ac- 
complished in our lives. Our 
hearts, and the hearts of our saint- 
ed parents before us, have been 
pricked by the power of God, we 
have all been made to know — father 
and mother, son and daughter — in 
the same marvelous manner, that 
this is the truth, the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. 

This is my testimony. I rejoice 
in it ; I know that I speak the truth, 
for it has been given to me by my 
Father, my Redeemer, my Creator. 



Thank God for it, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 

Gratifying condition of financial and 
other records of the Church. — One per 
cent death rate among members of 
the Church in Utah, in 1906.— Rea- 
sons for observing first day of week 
as Sabbath, and for believing in res- 
urrection. 

Brethren and Sisters : I feel a 
certain timidity, when I see this 
large congregation, and have to oc- 
cupy your attention for a time. I 
ask that the Spirit of the Lord may 
aid me in what I desire to say unto 
you. 

I have enjoyed the past sessions 
of the conference, and I believe all 
who have been present have been 
paid for coming, and have felt that 



this is the place for the Latter-day 
Saints. They have enjoyed the ad- 
dresses made, and have taken part 
in the business of the conference 
with pleasure, and everything has 
been done unanimously. 

I was pleased yesterday to hear 
the auditor's report. I know that it 
is exactly according to truth. These 
men who have been appoint- 
ed to act as auditors, devoted con- 
siderable time to go through all the 
accounts and books kept by the 
Church, and hence in giving their 
report they did so understandingly. 
They gave the true status of the fin- 
ancial affairs of the Church. I am 
pleased that our accounts are kept 
in such shape that everv cent is ac- 
counted for, so that it can be shown 
how the/ Church funds have been 
used. Much credit is due to the 
Presiding Bishopric and to Brother 
John Wells for the accurate man- 
ner in which the Church books are 
kept; and as they are kept in the 
general office, so they are now kept 
in all the stakes and wards of Zion. 
Less loss in handling produce has 
been reported this year than ever 
before. This shows how well the 
Bishops are taking care of the 
things pertaining to the Lord's 
storehouse. 

I am also able to say unto you 
that the historical and statistical 
records of the Church are getting 
into a similar condition of accuracy 
and completeness. As early as the 
6th of April, 1830, the Lord, in a 
revelation, told the Prophet Joseph 
that there should be records kept in 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Church; and later on John 
Whitmer was commanded to write 
a history of the Church. This is a 
very important matter. How glad 
we are that Matthew, Mark, Luke 
and John applied themselves to the 
work of writing a part of the his- 
tory of our Redeemer ! If they had 
not done so, how much we would 
have missed! We love to read the 
accounts given us in their gospels, 
of the beautiful life of our Savior 
while here upon the earth, and we 
are very thankful that these records 
were kept. Likewise we are thank- 
ful that we have the record called 
the Book of Mormon, which con- 
tains a history of the earliest set- 
tling of this continent. We rejoice 
that we have the writings of the 
Nephis, of Alma, and of all those 
recorders who gave us the history 
of the Lord's hand dealings with 
His people upon this land. When 
Lehi left Jerusalem he saw the ne- 
cessity of having records with him, 
and sent his sons back to get the 
records kept by one of his kinsmen. 
He obtained the history of the peo- 
ple of the Lord until within six 
hundred years of Christ. The 
prophecies of several of the proph- 
ets, the accounts from the creation 
up to that time, were brought with 
them to this land, and this helped 
them to regulate their lives, to obey 
the laws of God, to remember what 
the Lord had done for their fore- 
fathers, and to keep their language 
purer than they otherwise could 
have done. As I said, when the 
Church was organized in our day 
the Lord commanded that records 
should be kept. I wish that com- 
mandment had been more strictly 
obeyed and more elaborate records 
had been kept from the beginning 
of the Church. What history we 
have is correct, but John Whitmer's 



record and the records of the earlv 
recorders of the Church are not 
very extensive, and if it were not 
for the history of the Prophet Jos- 
eph, and the journals kept by some 
of our leading men in those early 
days, our knowledge of the interest- 
ing events of that remarkable pe- 
riod of our history would be very 
meager. We are trying to obtain 
from journals, letters and corres- 
pondence additional historical mat- 
ter to what we have in the history 
of the Prophet Joseph, and we 
gather many interesting facts from 
precious documents which have 
been kept in different families. We 
hope that the descendants of the 
early members of the Church who 
kept journals or records of any 
kind will be kind enough to bring 
them to the Historian's Office, and 
give us the opportunity either to 
keep them or to copy them, in or- 
der that the facts recorded may be 
remembered. 

In late years great importance 
has been attached to the keeping of 
the statistics of the Church. We 
have these reports bound, and they 
give us interesting data, and will 
be more and more valuable in 
time to come. In looking over 
the statistics of the Church for the 
last year, I find that there has been 
a substantial increase in the mem- 
bers added to the Church : 542 more 
births in 1906 than in 1905, and 
the death rate was considerably 
smaller — 332 less than in 1905. In 
fact, the death rate in all the stakes 
of Zion combined does not exceed 
one per cent. This is quite an item 
for the life insurance companies. If 
such a rate could be kept up, the 
prophecies would be fulfilled that 
people should live to be a hundred 
years old. I believe that the mode 
of living observed by the Latter- 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

day Saints tends to longevity, and 
that if the Saints will follow the 
counsel that has been given in this 
conference on the subject of the 
Word of Wisdom, they will add 
years to their lives. Instead of in- 
dulging in appetites that are de- 
structive to the system, they should 
live pla^n and simple lives, and 
they would thereby receive much 
greater happiness. If, however, 
they allow themselves to gratify 
their appetites for strong drink, 
tobacco or other stimulants, they 
create an almost uncontrollable 
longing for these things, and form 
a habit that is very hard to over- 
come, and which is ruinous to the 
functions of the vital organs. I 
do honor those who, though having 
strong desires for these things, still 
do not yield, but resist and over- 
come their inclinations. Let us 
try, brethren and sisters, to follow 
the counsel of the Lord who gave 
this advice to us, not to take from 
us the pleasures of life, but rather 
to increase them ; for what is of 
greater benefit to the human body 
than health, and health cannot be 
enjoyed if we go contrary to the 
laws which the Lord has laid down. 
I believe that the keeping of the 
Word of Wisdom, to the extent that 
the Saints have kept it, is responsi- 
ble for the low death rate. 

I notice also in the statistical re- 
port that more of our young people 
have entered the temples last year 
than the year before, and they have 
been sealed by the authority the 
Lord has given His servants. I 
would encourage our young people 
to marry, and to marry right. They 
should keep themselves pure and 
free from the sins of the world, that 
when they wish to marry, their 
Bishops can give them recommends 
to the temples, and at the altar of 



the Lord they can be sealed for 
time and for all eternity by that au- 
thority which binds on earth and 't 
shall be bound in heaven. We be- 
lieve in the eternity of the marriage 
contract. We do believe in a 
future life. We gave evidence of 
this belief in answer to the ques- 
tion asked us yesterday. We be- 
lieve that life is continuous. We be- 
lieve in the resurrection, and that 
the spirit and body will again be 
united; we believe that we will 
know as we are known, and that the 
marriage relation will continue, that, 
husband and wife will dwell to- 
gether through all eternity, that the: 
love which binds their hearts to- 
gether upon the earth wil! not 
leave them at death, but that it will 
endure eternally, and hence we en- 
courage our young people to com- 
mence their married life in the 
right way. 

There is a matter to which I 
would like to call the attention of 
our brethren and sisters, and that 
is our Sunday meetings. It is a 
pleasure to visit some of our wards 
and find every seat taken and our 
meeting houses full of worshipers, 
but there are too many wards whej-e 
the Saints are not so attentive to 
this duty. We go to the house of 
worship to receive spiritual food, to 
be instructed and advised by the 
servants of the Lord and to wor- 
ship Him to whom we owe all. He 
has commanded that we should go 
to the house of worship on the day 
appointed, and let us not feel sat- 
isfied on that day to stay at home, 
or think that by reading some good 
book we can be instructed as well 
as by going to meeting. Remem- 
ber that the meeting is the place 
where we renew our covenants ; we 
partake of the Sacrament, and re- 
new our vows to serve the Lord, 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and His Spirit is promised us when 
we do this in sincerity. It puts us 
in communion with Him who insti- 
tuted the Sacrament. It is our duty 
to go to the table of the Lord and 
partake of the emblems of His body 
and blood, but this must be done in 
the right way. We must not go 
there with hard feelings towards 
our brethren and sisters. Those 
who take part in that sacred ordi- 
nance must be one, for if they are 
not, or are under transgression, or 
harbor feelings of hatred in their 
hearts towards any of their breth- 
ren, they eat and drink unworthily. 
The Apostle Paul says that anyone 
who does so "eateth and drinketh 
damnation to himself." Conse- 
quently we must watch ourselves 
that we do not so partake of it. 
Some may say : "If there is dan- 
ger of eating and drinking unto 
condemnation, we had better not 
touch it," but the Lord has given a 
commandment that we are to par- 
take of the Sacrament, and if we 
abstain from doing this, we are not 
fulfilling our duty. It is a great 
blessing to partake of the Sacra- 
ment. In doing it our thoughts go 
back to Him who gave His life for 
us, and we make the covenant that 
we will take upon us His name and 
keep His commandments, and al- 
ways remember Him, and we are 
promised that we shall have His 
Spirit. In doing this we are blessed 
and strengthened for the coming 
week's work. 

In regard to the Sabbath dav I 
will say that there is no doubt in 
the minds of the Latter-day Saints 
in regard to the day of the week 
on which we are to worshin. In 
the beginning the Sabbath was com- 
manded to be observed on the sev- 
enth day. The Lord rested on that 
day. Israel observed it very strict- 



ly. There are instances where per- 
sons were put to death who violated 
this command of the Lord. There 
are instances in the Jewish history 
where the people out of reverence 
for the Sabbath would not engage 
in battle on that day. If their en- 
emies, the Gentiles, attacked them 
on the Sabbath day, they would not 
defend themselves, hence leaving it 
very easy for their enemies to gain 
the victory, so strict were they in 
the observance of the day which the 
Lord had apoointed. But we ob- 
serve the first day of the week. Is 
there any commandment in the 
Scriptures in regard to this ? Read- 
ing the New Testament through we 
cannot find any direct command to 
change the Sabbath to the first day, 
and some Christian sects hold that 
all the rest of the Christian world 
have gone astray because they keep 
the first day of the week holy in- 
stead of the seventh day. Some 
have attacked us on this point, and 
they have said : Your principles are 
strictly in accord with the teachings 
of the apostles formerly, but you do 
not keep the commandment of the 
Lord in regard to the Sabbath day. 
We are informed in the Scriptures 
that the Lord, our Savior, was res- 
urrected upon a Sunday A week 
ago we celebrated the anniversary 
of His resurrection. We believe 
that He was resurrected bodily; 
that the man Jesus, the Son of God, 
did as He had told His disciples He 
would do : on the third day He took 
up His body. That same day He 
appeared to some of the disciples 
and to some of the women. On the 
Sunday following He appeared to 
His apostles, and showed them the 
marks on His body, convincing the 
"doubting Thomas" who would not 
believe unless he should see Him 
himself. He was gratified to see

the Savior, but he got this gentle 
reproof : "Blessed are they that 
have not seen and yet have be- 
lieved." Thomas doubted at first, 
but his doubts were dispelled. The 
admonition is to all of us that we 
must not reject that which is taught 
us, just because we have not seen 
it ourselves. By taking the testi- 
mony of others we increase our 
store of knowledge. By taking the 
testimony of the aoostles and five 
hundred who saw Jesus at one 
time, we increase our knowledge to 
this extent : that we know that one 
person conquered death. Then we 
read that other resurrected beings 
were seen in Jerusalem, having ris- 
en from their graves — showing that 
the resurrection was not confined 
to Jesus alone, and that it com- 
menced not before, but after, Christ 
had conquered death. 

What an inspiring thought, that 
death is conquered, that Jesus won 
the victory over death ! It was a 
great event, worthy of being cele- 
brated and remembered. There is 
no doubt in my mind that the apos- 
tles taught the Saints to come to- 
gether on the first day of the week 
— on the Sunday — to make that the 
day of worship. The Jews, you 
know, were very strict as to the 
Saturday, the seventh day, and 
they dared, perhaps, not neglect 
that day. Not only did they keep 
the Sabbath according- to the Mo- 
saic law ; but we find that they also 
came together for worshio on the 
Sunday, the Lord's day. They par- 
took of the Sacrament on that day. 
Paul at one-time preached on the 
Sunday evening so late that one 
person, falling asleep, fell down 
from the third story, and was found 
to be dead, but Paul, by the power 
of God, raised him from the dead. 
If you will refer to the Corinthians 



you will see that Paul there alludes 
to the Saints coming together on 
the Sunday. Writers from the first 
century tell us that the Christians 
met on the Sunday and made that 
their holy day. I believe that this 
custom was inaugurated by the 
apostles. The day of the resur- 
rection was of such importance that 
they made the first day, on which it 
took place, the Sabbath day, or the 
holy day of the week. You remem- 
ber the commandment of the Lord, 
recorded in the book of Deuteron- 
omy, in regard to the Sabbath day, 
as follows : "But the seventh day 
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. 
In it thou shalt not do any work 
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, 
nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid- 
servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, 
nor any of thy cattle, nor thy 
stranger that is within thy gates, 
that thy man-servant and thy maid- 
servant may rest as well as thou ; 
and remember that thou wast a ser- 
vant in the land of Egypt, and that 
the Lord thy God brought thee out 
thence through a mighty hand and 
by a stretched out arm; therefore 
the Lord God commanded thee to 
keep the Sabbath day." One rea- 
son is given here by the Lord why 
Israel should observe the Sabbath, 
namely, their wonderful deliverance 
from servitude through His power, 
and they were commanded to com- 
memorate this event on the seventh 
day. Is it, then, so strange that 
the apostles formerly changed the 
day to remember the much greater 
event — the event of the resurrec- 
tion, and that Sunday on which that 
great event occurred became the 
Sabbath day unto the Saints? 

It is impossible for all to keep 
the Sabbath day at the very same 
time all over the globe. If all the 
people lived on one longtitude or 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



meridian they could keep it at the 
same time, but as they are now 
scattered around the globe, there 
is a great difference in time. For 
instance, children went to Sunday 
School in New Zealand yesterday 
at half past two o'clock. It was 
Saturday to us ; it was ten o'clock 
Sunday morning to them. The 
children on the Hawaiian Islands 
will go to Sunday School about one 
o'clock today, and it will be ten 
o'clock then for them. Thus, at a 
given time it may be Sunday for 
one set of people and Saturday for 
people in another nlace. The teach- 
ers in the Hawaiian Sunday School 
might say today to the children, 
"Your brethren in New Zealand 
met yesterday, when it was twelve 
o'clock here, in their Sunday 
School," and the children would 
likely say, Why, they have Sunday 
School on a Saturday !" The line 
which divides the time, or which in- 
dicates where day begins, is an ar- 
bitra— ■ one made by men for the 
sake of convenience. It is located 
the very best place that it could 
be, because there are very few in- 
habitants that the line will strike. 
It passes over the Pacific Ocean, 
and in order that no island shall 
have Saturday on one side and Sun- 
day on the other, they have turned 
the line around the groups in the 
Pacific Ocean, so that those oer- 
taining to the same country, under 
the same government, mav have 
the same day; but this is all an ar- 
bitrary arrangement. If then the 
Lord acceoted the devotions of 
those who worshiped Him --°ster- 
day, calling the day Sunday, and 
accepts the worship of those living 
a short distance eastward who call 
today Sunday, the important ques- 
tion seems to be, not so much the 
exact time as the fact that one day 



in every seven is set apart to be a 
day of rest. 

There are some who strongly 
argue in favor of the Saturday as 
the Sabbath instead of the Sun- 
day, and they create in the minds 
of many a grave doubt as to which 
day is the correct day to be ob- 
served as Sabbath. Where such 
doubt exists it cannot be removed 
by any other means than revela- 
tion. When the Scriptures are si- 
lent on this point, and men do not 
feel to take tradition as a rule, then 
they are left without positive knowl- 
edge on the subject. The Latter- 
day Saints are not so left. The 
Lord in a revelation given to the 
Saints says : 

"And that thou mayest more fully 
keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
thou shalt go to the house of prayer 
and offer up thy sacraments upon my 
holy day; for verily this is a day ap- 
pointed unto you to rest from vour la- 
bors, and to pay thv devotions unto the 
Most High;" 

"Upon my holy day." Which is 
that day? This revelation was giv- 
en August seventh, 1831, which 
was a Sunday. The following par- 
agraph makes it plain that Sunday 
is the day set apart for worship : 

"But remember that on this the Lord's 
day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and 
thy sacraments unto the Most High, con- 
fessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and 
before the Lord." 

This takes away all doubt from 
the minds of the Saints, for here 
through the revelation of the Lord 
we are told that we are to hold the 
Sunday holy. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us 
go to our meetings ; let us worship 
the Lord ; let us not feel satisfied to 
stay at home; but always feel that 
it is a duty to go to the Lord's

house and there with the Saints 
partake of the blessings which He 
has promised. May the Lord bless 
you all is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

FAMINE IN CHINA. 

President John R. Winder moved 
the adoption of the following reso- 
lution : 

"Whereas, The president of the 
United States has called national at- 
tention to the existence of the sore 
distress in China on account of fam- 
ine, and 

"Whereas, The Lord has greatly 
blessed the Saints and all the inter- 
ests of the Church, and, 

"Whereas, our Relief Societies 
have stored up grain against a time 
of need ; now therefore, I move that 
the Trustee-in-Trust be, and is here- 
by authorized to appropriate and 
donate toward the relief of the poor 
in famine stricken China 20 tons 
of flour." 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire 
to second the resolution offered by 
President Winder to this confer- 
ence; and in doing so I desire to 
call attention to the fact that we are 
connected with an institution found- 
ed of God for the benefit of the 
whole world, and that it is an insti- 
tution of world-wide sympathies ; 
that it is an institution whose doc- 
trines recognize the great truth that 
the children of men are also the 
children of God, and that all men 
are brethren. No calamity can fall 
upon any of our Father's children 
but what our hearts go out in sym- 
pathy to them. I trust also that 
this movement, which I believe will 



be unanimously endorsed by this 
conference, may bear witness to the 
wisdom that exists in our methods 
of collecting means for charitable 
and religious purposes. Thank God, 
there is an institution in the earth 
whose charities are constantly ac- 
cumulating, that in the very mo- 
ment of need there is a means of 
ministering unto the children of 
men — a circumstance that speaks 
loudly for the divine wisdom that 
has made these provisions in the 
Church of Christ. With all my 
heart I second the resolution of 
President Winder. 

The resolution was adopted by 
unanimous vote of the congrega- 
tion. 

Brother Elihu Call rendered a 
tenor solo, entitled, "Save Me, O 
God." 

ELDER SYLVESTER a. CANNON. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in being present at this con- 
ference this morning; and I have 
rejoiced exceedingly in the meet- 
ings which have already been held. 
I trust that the few moments 
I stand before you, my remarks 
may be directed by the Spirit of 
the Lord. As has been said by 
President Smith, I have been call- 
ed to labor in the Netherlands 
mission. While I feel that there 
is a great work to be done here at 
home, I am happy in the opportun- 
ity of going abroad to again preach 
the Gospel in the nations of Hol- 
land and Belgium, because I can 
assure you that the mission I have 
already performed in those coun- 
tries was the most enjoyable time 
of my life. I believe that no 
greater joy can come to any one 
than the joy experienced in the sav- 
ing of human souls. Our Father 
has said that human souls are pre- 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



cious in His sight, and He has 
given a commandment to His 
Church that the Gospel shall be 
preached in all nations, and that 
every man, woman and ch.ild that 
is able to understand, shall have the 
opportunity of hearing the Gos- 
pel and receiving its blessings, if 
they believe the same and obey it. 
I rejoice in this call that has been 
made, because, as has been said 
here — more particularly in our 
priesthood meeting, — the people of 
those countries, Holland and Bel- 
gium, are a sturdy class, and those 
who are accepting the Gospel are 
among the best in those nations. 
They accept the Gospel because 
they understand the Bible. They 
have studied the Scriptures, and 
they are prepared, in very many in- 
stances, to receive the truth when 
the missionaries bring it to them. 
They seek to live according to the 
Gospel ; they seek to obey its pre- 
cepts, to live up to its require- 
ments. I feel that they are a good 
people. I believe that those who 
have accepted the Gospel will be 
true, generally speaking, to the end 
of their lives. The missionaries 
who have labored in that field have 
been diligent in their labors. I do 
not know the present situation with 
regard to the needs of the mission, 
respecting elders, but I do know 
that every man who is prepared to 
go forth and labor diligently, and 
in humility, for the progress of 
this work will be welcomed in the 
Netherlands mission. I believe 
there is no more fruitful field any- 
where in the world today than that 
mission. I rejoice in the prospect 
of the publication of the Doctrine 
and Covenants in that language, 
because the people have been long- 
ing for that record of revelations. 
At various times certain sections 
have been published, but the book 



as a whole has not been in their 
hands ; and I feel that it will prove 
a great blessing, and a great bene- 
fit to the saints who have accepted 
the Gospel there, to have the priv- 
ilege of reading and studying this 
important Church work. 

I rejoice in the prospects that are 
before us, my brethren and sisters. 
I desire to endorse and to sustain 
every action that has been taken at 
this conference thus far. I desire 
to sustain the Presidency of the 
Church and the Quorum of the 
Apostles, and every one of the 
general authorities. I realize that 
they are men of God, that they are 
indeed inspired ; and that they en- 
joy the spirit of their calling, which 
will enable them, and which 
does enable them, to guide 
and direct the affairs of 
'this Church in accordance 
with the will of our Father in heav- 
en. I pray that we as a people may 
sustain them, that we may be pre- 
pared to accept the instructions we 
receive and to carry them out. For 
myself, I desire with all my heart 
to remain true to this work to the' 
end of my life. I desire not only 
to be true to it, but I desire to be 
active in its behalf, for the further- 
ance of the work and the fulfilment 
of the responsibilities which the 
Lord has placed upon us. May the 
Lord bless us, and may we carry 
with us, wherever we go, the spirit 
of this conference ; may we seek to 
fulfill and carry out the instructions 
which have been given, or which 
may be given to us, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 

(President of Uintah Stake.) 

In speaking briefly, my brethren 
and sisters, of matters pertaining to 
the Stake over which I have been 



ELDER WILLIAM H. SMART. 



61 



called to preside, I sincerely hope 
that I may be actuated by the spirit 
of truth — the spirit of this confer- 
ence. It was, as I remember, last 
June when I was called to preside 
over the Uintah Stake of Zion, and 
in the month of August, having 
then been released from my labors 
in the Wasatch Stake, with my 
family I went immediately to Ver- 
nal, the headquarters of the Uintah 
Stake. The territory within the 
confines of the Uintah Indian Res- 
ervation, which had recently been 
thrown open for settlement, was 
placed within the organized Uintah 
Stake. The Uintah Stake proper 
had been organized twenty years. 
Brother Samuel R. Bennion, of 
Salt Lake County, was called as the 
first President of that Stake. Prior 
to that it was presided over by 
Jeremiah Hatch, as a presiding 
Elder, acting under the President 
of the Wasatch Stake, Abram 
Hatch. The Uintah Stake as it is 
now comprised is bordered on the 
east by Colorado, and on the west 
by the Wasatch Stake of Zion. It 
is in a general direct line between 
Salt Lake City and Denver. It holds 
an intermediate position between 
the country traversed by the Union 
Pacific railway and the Rio Grande 
railway, and consequently it bids 
fair to be pierced by another con- 
tinental railroad in the near future, 
which will facilitate the growth 
and interests of that country, 
which I verily believe has a great 
future. Speaking in a general 
way, the Uintah basin is about 125 
miles by 90 miles. It is of an oval 
shape. It is one of the best water- 
ed sections of the State of Utah. 
The main streams that flow into it 
are the Strawberry, Duchesne, Lake 
Fork, Uintah, Ashley, Green river, 
and White river, with their numer- 
ous tributaries. ' The soil has a 



sterile aspect; and one who goes 
from a grassy country will look 
upon it as a rather forbidding land ; 
but, like the soil of many parts of 
Southern Utah, and other places in 
the West where the land seems to 
be sterile, when it is blessed by ir- 
rigation, it is exceedingly fertile. 
There were some very glowing 
statements made with reference to 
this land prior to the opening of 
the Uintah Indian Reservation, 
and they were sometimes somewhat 
overdrawn. A great many people 
rushed there expecting to see an 
Eldorado, an oasis, — well cultivated 
farms and orchards, the products 
of the Indians' labor under the tut- 
elage of the government, and when 
they found that the country had 
to be made, many of them were 
dissatisfied and went away, not to 
return. Some of these people have 
scattered broadcast unfavorable 
statements concerning the land, and 
the impression has got out that 
there is so much mineral matter in 
the soil that it will continue sterile 
and barren. But upon the Uintah 
Indian Reservation territory last 
year there was some as fine cereals 
raised, as well as watermelons, po- 
tatoes and other vegetables, as I 
have ever looked upon. This is 
perhaps a strong statement, but I 
was myself exceedingly surprised 
to see the fine results of husbandry 
in this virgin soil the first year. I 
firmly believe that the prediction 
made by President Lyman, at the 
re-organization conference last 
June, will be fulfilled, wherein he 
stated that the time would come 
when that district would be looked 
upon as one of the most important 
parts of the State of Utah. I 
want to say to you brethren and 
sisters who are not satisfied where 
you are, who have not sufficient 
land, and not sufficient means to 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



increase your acreage, and are 
looking for homes elsewhere, I do 
not know of a better place than the 
Uintah basin. I speak of this in 
truth. I thank God I have got the 
spirit of love for that country, since 
I am called to preside over it, but 
I thank Him too that my heart is 
not closed against other parts of 
His footstool. I feel in this mat- 
ter very largely as that character 
into whose mouth the immortal 
Shakespeare put these words : "Not 
that I love Caesar less, but that I 
love Rome more." So I feel with 
reference to the Uintah basin — not 
that I love other lands less, but that 
I love the Uintah basin more. 

As to the people in that land who 
have assisted in the reclamation of 
the old Uintah Stake of Zion, I feel 
to speak of them in the highest 
praise. Brother Samuel R. Benn- 
ion is a man of sturdy qualities, 
conservative, well-balanced, econ- 
omical, active in his labors, and he 
has taught the people there how to 
wrest from mother earth the neces- 
saries of life, and then to hold 
them as sacred trusts, as their 
stewardships, under the hands of 
God. Under his guardianship and 
guiding hand the people are becom- 
ing thrifty and progressive. His 
counselors have ably assisted him 
in the work. I find that many 
of the people there are descendants 
of fathers and mothers from Utah 
and Salt Lake counties, and they 
are a very fine class of people. The 
majority seem to be progressing, 
vet among them we find some who 
have been indifferent in the lands 
from which they have come, and 
they continued indifferent. Some 
have even forsaken the faith of 
their fathers, but, perhaps you re- 
member that at various times the 
Apostles and other missionaries 
"have gone into the Stake and held 



meetings, and I am thankful to say, 
they have reaped a rich har- 
vest; yea, I am glad to report that 
some of the most active workers in 
the Church there today have been 
reclaimed by the administrations of 
these men of God. 

There are three general ways to 
approach that land. One by means 
of the Rio Grande railroad as far 
as Heber, and thence east into the 
Uintah basin. Another by way of 
the Rio Grande railroad to Price, 
and thence by wagonroad. Another 
leaving the Rio Grande railroad at 
Mack, just over the dividing line 
between Utah and Colorado, taking 
there the Uintah railroad, a small 
branch that passes over the Book 
Cliff mountains, and enters the 
Uintah basin, having its terminus 
at Dragon. From there you take 
team conveyance, and it is one day's 
drive to Vernal. There are many 
people settling on that land who 
are not of the Latter-day Saints' 
faith, and I am pleased to state that, 
as a rule, our people and our broth- 
ers and sisters of other faiths, or of 
no faith, are dwelling in peace to- 
gether. They are uniting in the 
building up of that country, and 
there is very little of that spirit 
which, I am sorry to say, we 
breathe to some extent when we 
come into the atmosphere of this 
city, the principal place of Zion. 
There is great credit due to the 
Uintah Railroad Company in build- 
ing that little railroad from Mack 
to Dragon; and, while it was done 
largely from a commercial stand- 
point, yet some of those connected 
with it have felt an interest in that 
country from almost its early settle- 
ment, and they have a sentimental 
pride in seeing its development, as 
well as satisfaction in receiving a 
reasonable amount for the expendi- 
ture of their means. This railroad

passes over the Book Cliff range; 
you who have traversed it will re- 
member that the descent is very 
precipitous, and that the railroad 
takes a serpentine course. There 
are some portions where you can 
see the railroad track curves seven 
or eight times. It shows the won- 
derful ingenuity and determination 
of this company in building that 
road. 

The Presidency and High Coun- 
cil of the Uintah Stake are united. 
All the wards are presided over by 
men of God. There are six wards 
and four branches, and others in 
embryo. Much of the territory of 
the old Uintah Reservation is com- 
prised in one ward — the Duchesne 
• — and there are several branches 
under its protectorate. As the 
country grows it naturally will be 
divided up into more wards. Last 
winter there was excellent mission- 
ary work done in that Stake. There 
was a missionary committee of the 
High Council appointed, and they 
acted in connection with the Bish- 
oprics of the wards, and had as as- 
sistants all of the home mission- 
aries, the Stake Presidency, the 
High Council, and all the teachers 
in the various wards. They divid- 
ed the work of the Stake among 
them. They went into each teach- 
ers' district and visited the homes 
of every family. In those visits 
there was a representation of the 
Stake authorities, of the Bishopric, 
and of the teachers of that district. 
They visited every home, regardless 
of the faith of the residents. After 
the teachers' district was finished, 
then they held a general district 
meeting, calling all the families of 
the saints together within that dis- 
trict. After this was done in all 
the teachers' districts in the res- 
pective wards, then there was a 
general meeting held, calling to- 



gether all the people of the various 
districts. The brethren testified 
that they had never witnessed a 
greater outpouring of the Spirit of 
God ; and through their efficient 
labors quite a number have become 
investigators. 

May God bless us, brethren and 
sisters, that we may continue en- 
deavoring to do His work, spread 
the truth, reclaim the soil, and re- 
deem ourselves through the bless- 
ings of the Gospel. I ask it, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

The re-establishment of the Church of 
Christ. — Fulfilment of ancient proph- 
ecies. — Testimony concerning person- 
ality of the Father and the Son. — A 
knowledge of God necessary to ob- 
tain eternal lit'e. — Unrighteous do- 
minion cannot be exercised by the 
Priesthood. 

I am deeply grateful to God, my 
Eternal Father that I have 
the privilege of attending this 
glorious conference to hear 
"the glad tidings of great 
joy," and the good things that have 
been said in defense of the work 
of the Lord. I am thankful for 
the privilege of being a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and that it has 
pleased the Father to give me a 
testimony ccncerning the divinity 
of this work. For a great many 
years, I have been advocating the 
principles of the Everlasting Gos- 
pel. It is wonderful to me, that at 
my advanced age, I enjoy the mea- 
sure of life and health that I do, 
and that I have been enabled to at- 
tend the meetings of this confer- 
ence and to rejoice in the spirit and 
influence thereof. 

I know that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is the 
Church of the Lamb. I know that 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God hears- and answers prayers; 
and it seems to me perfectly con- 
sistent that we should trust in the 
Lord. Viewing this immense con- 
gregation, looking upon the glori- 
ous sight it presents, I am impress- 
ed with this wonderful gathering 
of precious souls, the redeemed of 
the Lord who have accepted the 
principles of the Everlasting Gos- 
pel, and who have a living testi- 
mony, so that they know His will. 
As I say, sometimes, "We know 
what we know." We are perfect- 
ly certain, but we cannot always ex- 
plain it. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a true prophet of God. How- 
do I know it ? He taught the same 
principles that were taught by the 
Messiah and His apostles on the 
eastern continent ; the same princi- 
ples that were taught on this west- 
ern continent, when the Lord Jesus 
Christ visited the ancient Nephites, 
when He revealed Himself unto 
them, and instructed them in His 
doctrines. And in these last days 
the Lord inspired His servant Jos- 
eph, and revealed His mind and 
will unto him concerning the or- 
ganization of the Church of Christ 
upon the earth, with the same prin- 
ciples as taught anciently, and with 
the signs following the believers. 
It seems to me a very natural thing 
that God the Eternal Father should 
manifest Himself unto His servant 
Joseph Smith, then a boy, whom 
He had ordained from before the 
foundation of the earth to usher in 
the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. I believe that ''Known un- 
to God are all things from the be- 
ginning," and I believe that He 
knew everything concerning the es- 
tablishment of His Church upon the 
earth in these last days. This 
Church has been properly organ- 
ized, for the Lord Jesus Christ Him- 
self organized it. He organized it 



with "apostles and prophets, evan- 
gelists, pastors, and teachers," "for 
the work of the ministry and for 
the edifying of the body of Christ." 
"Ye are the body of Christ and 
members in particular." In con- 
sequence of this organization, the 
inhabitants of the earth have the 
opportunity, if they desire it, to be- 
come the disciples of Jesus Christ. 
Joseph Smith was a disciple of 
Jesus Christ. Hyrum Smith, his 
brother and fellow martyr, was also 
a disciple of Jesus Christ. They 
manifested by their integrity the 
truth of the principles they advo- 
cated. 

This wonderful oragnization has 
been brought about in fulfilment of 
prophecy, — the coming of John the 
Baptist to restore the Aaronic 
priesthood ; the coming of the 
prophet Moroni, bringing forth the 
Book of Mormon, containing the 
fulness of the everlasting Gospel ; 
the coming of Peter, James, and 
John, restoring the keys of the holy 
apostleship and the sealing power, 
so that there might be a representa- 
tive upon the earth, with authority 
to seal upon the earth and it should 
be sealed in the heavens. Also, the 
coming of Elijah to turn the hearts 
of the children to the fathers, and 
the fathers to the children ; and the 
voice of one crying in the wilder- 
ness: "Prepare ye the way of the 
Lord, make straight in the desert 
a highway for our God. Every 
valley shall be exalted, and every 
mountain and hill shall be made 
low : and the crooked shall be made ' 
straight, and the rough places, 
plain : And the glory of the Lord 
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall 
see it together, for the rpouth of 
the Lord hath spoken it." "Com- 
fort ye, comfort ye my people, saith

her warfare is accomplished, that 
her iniquity is pardoned : for she 
hath received of the Lord's hand 
double for all her sins." We are 
on the eve of the fulfilment of these 
precious promises. . 

It had to be that there should be 
a testator upon the earth who knew 
that God was a personal being. The 
Apostle Paul said: "God, who at 
sundry times, and in divers man- 
ners spake in times past unto the 
fathers by the prophets, hath in 
these last days spoken unto us by 
His Son, whom He hath appoint- 
ed heir of all things, by whom also 
He made the worlds, Who being 
the brightness of His glory, and 
the express image of His person, 
and upholding all things by the 
word of His power, when He had 
by Himself purged our sins, sat 
down on the right hand of the Ma- 
jesty on high." From this we 
know that the Lord Jesus Christ 
was the express image of His Fath- 
er's person, but this knowledge of 
God had been lost, and consequent 
ly it had to be restored, and in that 
restoration we have obtained the 
testimony that we declare. 

The Lord said that whoso would 
"do the will of the Father should 
know of the doctrine." Is this vast 
congregation deceived, and under 
the dominion of priestcraft? Can 
it be asserted that this concourse of 
intelligent people did not know 
what they were saying when they 
declared this morning, with united 
voice, that they knew that God 
lives ; that Jesus is the Christ ; and 
that Joseph Smith was a true 
prophet sent of God ? How do we 
know it? By our experience, the 
signs following the believer, the 
testimony coming through obedi- 
ence. The Lord promised us this 
knowledge and He has fulfilled His 
promise. Paul said he was not 



ashamed of the Gospel of 
Christ, for it was "the 
power of God unto salvation," and 
"therein was the righteousness of 
God revealed, — from faith to 
faith." The Lord said that to 
know God and Jesus Christ, whom 
He hath sent, is eternal life. If we 
could not obtain this knowledge 
we certainly would come short of 
eternal life. It is a kindly dispen- 
sation that the Almighty has given 
unto us in the restoration of this 
knowledge by the spirit of revel- 
ation — that Spirit which revealed 
unto Peter that Jesus was the 
Christ. The Lord told Peter how 
it was brought about : "Blessed art 
thou, Simon Barjona." What for? 
Because he said he knew that Jesus 
was the Christ, the son of the liv- 
ing God. How did he obtain that 
knowledge? By the spirit of rev- 
elation, the same Spirit that we 
have in this day. "Blessed art thou, 
Simon Barjona, for -flesh and blood 
hath not revealed this unto you, but 
My Father which is in heaven. And 
I say also unto thee, That thou 
art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my Church, and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it." 
The gates of hell cannot prevail 
against the spirit of revelation. 

This knowledge comes to the be- 
liever in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
through obeying the principles of 
the Everlasting Gospel. No mat- 
ter what our circumstances, we 
may, if we desire, obtain the fellow- 
ship of the Holy Ghost, and the 
Holy Ghost imparts light and truth, 
illuminating our minds and im- 
pressing us so that we are enabled 
to understand, by having "eyes to 
see and ears to hear," and the un- 
derstanding heart. This the Latter- 
day Saints claim to have ; and I 
know they have it, for I have had 
years of experience, — longer than 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ever I anticipated, having passed 
my 75th year — having advocated 
these principles ever since 1852. I 
know they are true. But this 
knowledge does not inspire me with 
the spirit of contention. I do not 
contend with anybody to try to im- 
press upon them what I believe 
or know. The Lord said to the 
Nephites that contention was not of 
Him. but was of the devil. I 
notice that the Latter-day Saints 
who love the principles of eternal 
life, are cheerful, happy, and satis- 
fied ; they have a living testimony. 
I notice, on the other hand, that 
people who do not have that testi- 
mony, who do not have the fellow- 
ship of the Spirit of Gpd, are dis- 
satisfied and contentious. The 
Apostle Paul has given us a rule 
whereby we may judge these 
things. He said: "For, brethren, 
ye have been called unto liberty; 
only use not liberty for an occasion 
to the flesh, but by love serve one 
another. For all the law is fulfilled 
in one word, even in this : Thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 
But if ye bite and devour one an- 
other, take heed that ye be not con- 
sumed one of another. This I 
say then. Walk in the Spirit, and ye 
shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 
For the flesh lusteth against the 
Spirit, and the Spirit against the 
flesh : and these are contrary the 
one to the other : so that ye cannot 
do the things that ye would. But 
if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are 
not under the law. Now the works 
of the flesh are manifest, which are 
these : Adultery, fornication, un- 
cleanness. lasciviousness,. idolatry, 
withchcraft, hatred, variance, em- 
ulations, wrath, strife, seditions, 
heresies, envyings, murders, drunk- 
enness, revellings, and such like : of 
the which I tell you before, as I 
have also told you in the time past, 



that they which do such things 
shall not inherit the kingdom of 
God. But the fruit of the Spirit 
is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, 
gentleness, goodness, faith, meek- 
ness, temperance, against such 
there is no law. And they that are 
Christ's have crucified the flesh 
with the affections and lusts. If 
we live in the Spirit, let us also 
walk in. the Spirit." That is how 
I understand it. That is the dif- 
ference manifest between the two 
spirits. There is the spirit of 
hatred, the spirit of contention, fal- 
sifying, lying, slandering, and all 
manner of unrighteousness. Do 
the leading men of the Church— 
the First Presidency and Apostles 
— manifest this disposition? No. 
They are men of God, men of long- 
suffering, who love the Lord Jesus 
Christ and would not do anything 
to grieve His Holy Spirit, if they 
knew it. We are united in preach- 
ing the Everlasting Gospel. We 
find no fault with anybody else; it 
takes us all our time to advocate 
the truth. 

I am thankful that I have the 
privilege of standing before you, 
my beloved fellow-laborers — you 
presidents of stakes, and counsel- 
ors, and high-councilors, who aid 
us by your faith, prayers, and loy- 
alty. It is impossible to express 
the affection we have for you. Hav- 
ing passed from death unto life, 
we know that we love the brethren, 
as the Apostle John expresses it. 
You know that we love you, and 
you know that we do not presume 
to exercise any unrighteous domin- 
ion, or anything of the kind, but 
that we are striving for the further- 
ance of the purposes of the Al- 
mighty in the establishment of His 
righteousness upon the earth. 

I thank you, as a member of the 
Council of the Apostles, for your 



ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 



67 



faith and prayers. You see me to- 
day in the enjoyment of health. 
About twelve months ago I was not 
in that condition. I passed through 
the narrows, but my life was pre- 
served. I have needed your faith 
and prayers, and I am thankful un- 
to you that I have had them, for 
the Lord has healed me, and He has 
prolonged my life upon the earth, 
in answer to your prayers. I am 
grateful that you have sustained 
me. I feel my Own unworthiness, 
and I would not dare to exercise 
any unrighteous dominion, or go 
to any foolish extreme to have my 
own ways or notions carried out. 

I know that the First Presidency, 
and the brethren of the Twelve, are 
men of God. I bear this testimony, 
that the Church of Christ is estab- 
lished upon the earth by the power 
of God; that we hold the Everlast- 
ing Priesthood ; that we have au- 
thority to call the sinner to repent* 
ance, to baptize by immersion for 
the remission of sins, and through 
the laying on of hands that they 
may receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. We have the privilege of 
advocating the doctrine of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and administering in 
His holy sacrament. I am thank- 
ful that I have the opportunity of 
declaring these precious truths at 
this wonderful conference. Seven- 
ty-seven years ago, the Church of 
Jesus Christ was restored to the 
earth. Think of it. Think of the 
inspiring meetings that have been 
held here. All glory to God the 
Eternal Father, who by His power 
and might has brought about this 
wonderful gathering, through Je- 
sus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 



We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter-days ; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays; 
We thank Thee for every blessing 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Henry F. McCune. 

Conference adjourned till 2 p. m 



Overflow Meeting. 

An overflow session of the Con- 
ference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a. m. Elder Heber J. 
Grant presided, and Prof. Charles 
J. Thomas conducted the singing. 

The congregation sang: the hymn, 
"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
John W. Woolley. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 

O, say, what is truth? 'Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce ; 
And priceless the value of truth will be 

when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 



ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of Northwestern States 
Mission.) 

Brothers and sisters, I approach 
this duty with much misgiving, be- 
cause I am not accustomed to 
preaching to large congregations. 
I hope that the same Spirit that has 
been in the former meetings of this 
conference may rest upon this con- 
gregation, and inspire those who 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



shall address us this morning. Our 
brethren can speak impressively 
when the inspiration and power of 
God is upon them, and their words 
are then profitable to those who 
hear; therefore, I pray that you 
will bless the brethren by petitioning 
the Lord that their words may be 
inspired, and all of us be fed with 
the bread of life. The object of my 
particular thoughts and affection is 
the Northwestern States Mission, 
with its elders and scattered Saints, 
and a little more than two million 
inhabitants. I love Zion, with its 
temples, tabernacles, institutions of 
learning, and its people, of course, 
above all things in the earth; but 
my time is occupied in the mission- 
ary field, and a man speaks general- 
ly of that which he is accustomed 
to do, in which his heart is inter- 
ested. 

We have about thirty-eight of the 
sons of this peonle. from Idaho 
and Utah, in my mission, and there 
has not been a man in it for five 
years, with perhaps two exceptions 
that come to my mind, but who has 
faithfully obeyed the Word of Wis- 
dom. A few have come to me and 
expressed regret that they had not 
been oroperly taught to oray in the 
family circle; because their father 
had done most of the praying. 
Some of these young brethren re- 
ally made their first effort to learn 
to pray when we called upon them 
to kneel with us at headquarters, 
when they joined the mission. As a 
rule, they become devout, and make 
splendid missionaries. We had one 
in our corps who was a remarkable 
example of what may be overcome 
by determination and the aid of the 
Spirit of the Lord. He said to me 
on one occasion : 'Brother Pratt, 
before I came on this mission I was 
addicted to the use of spirituous 



liquors, and tobacco, and was a 
cigarette fiend. I was also inclined 
to profanity, and I have had a fight 
to wage with myself that few elders 
that come into the mission field have 
ever had. But I smoked my last ci- 
garette after I accepted the call, and 
have never smoked since; I have 
never since taken a glass of liquor 
of any kind, and I have kept the 
Word of Wisdom strictly. I re- 
joice to say that this young man 
made a splendid missionary. He 
came home and doubtless will be a 
shining light. His father and moth- 
er were able to look into the eyes of 
a virtuous young man who had 
truly repented, and found the Lord. 
I have no doubt he will be a good 
son, a good husband, and a good 
father, if the Lord blesses him with 
children. This is what a mission is 
doing occasionally for wayward 
sons of this people. There are none 
among my elders that have defiled 
themselves with sin. 

My field is open to the sons of 
this people, because God appoints 
them. I want you to know that 
however your sons come to me, my 
heart is open to receive them, be- 
cause the Spirit of the Lord makes 
me feel thus toward them. But O 
ye Saints, see to it that your sons 
are prepared to come virtuous, 
honorable and noble examples of 
righteous training. 

Now, brethren and sisters, one 
word about the schools in Zion. 
where the boys are receiving an ed- 
ucation. I have seen the benefit to 
the elders who have studied in the 
Church schools on the line of mis- 
sionary work. If your means are suf- 
ficient, and you can give your sons 
who are expected to take missions 
a training in the Church schools, 
you should do so, that they may 
come to the mission field somewhat 



ELDER SAMUEL O.BENNION.

prepared, comprehending the first 
principles of the Gospel, and able 
to pray. Furthermore, let your boys 
and girls be trained to sing the 
hymns of Zion. If I could get some 
more good singers up in my coun- 
try I would be much pleased. 

Brethren and sisters, I bless you, 
as one who loves God, and with a 
heart full of thanksgiving for this 
great conference, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, it af- 
fords me much pleasure to have the 
privilege of attending conference, 
and being able to meet you here in 
Salt Lake City this spring. I have 
listened with much interest to the 
remarks of Brother Pratt, knowing 
that he has spoken from experience 
and that he is interested in the work 
of our Father in his mission. 

We have a large number of the 
sons and daughters of Zion in the 
Central States mission, about a hun- 
dred and forty-five of them. I wish 
we had a hundred more to assist 
in the great work that is being done 
in that mission. In the state of 
Missouri alone, where there are 
perhaps two million people, we have 
only about twenty-four elders, and 
some of the counties of that state 
have never been canvassed by a 
Mormon missionary. We are receiv- 
ing inquiries and invitations for us 
to send the elders to visit them, 
that the people might become ac- 
quainted with the principles and 
doctrines of Christ as they are set 
forth and taught by the Latter-day 
Saints. I am glad also to say that 



in that state, where they were so 
unfriendly to us once, there is now 
a feeling of friendliness toward us. 
In the city of Independence, where 
we have recently located our head- 
quarters, the people generally are 
quite friendly. They meet us on the 
street and shake hands with us, as 
though they had met us before. Ap- 
parently they feel like we have re- 
sided with them always, and there 
is not the spirit of antagonism that 
there was once. I am very thankful 
to the Lord that this is the case, that 
we are living in peace with our 
neighbors, although it is a strong- 
hold of the reorganized church. A 
number of the lay-members of that 
organization are attending the ser- 
vices that we hold. The second or 
third Sunday we were there we 
had to rent a hall in Independence 
in order to accommodate the peo- 
ple — people who had belonged to 
the Whitmerites and to various 
other off-shoots from the Mormon 
Church. They are attending our 
classes in the Sabbath Schools. Two 
old gentlemen told me, a few days 
before I left, "We are interested in 
your work; we love the Book of 
Mormon that you use as a text book 
in your Sabbath School." One of 
them said, "It sounds good to me; 
it is the first time I have been inter- 
ested in it since my youth." They 
belonged to the Whitmerite church, 
but, they said, "We are going: to in- 
vestigate, we are going to stav with 
you and see what vou have to tearb 
us." 

The work of the Lord is growing 
in the Central States mission. 
Brother Duffin, who labored and 
presided there before I did, laid a 
good foundation, and we are getting 
along nicely, and enjoy our labors. 
The elders are honest and energetic ; 
I don't think we have a drone in 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the hive ; we distribute in the neigh- 
borhood of two thousand books 
each month. These elders are busy 
holding meetings, and find many in- 
quirers, perhaps three to where we 
used to have one, and they are la- 
boring zealously for the upbuilding 
of the Church and Kingdom of 
God. I want to tell you, brethren 
and sisters, that you should assist 
them here at home. Pray for the 
success of these elders, that they 
may not be led astray, but that they 
may remain faithful and patriotic in 
the great work that they have been 
sent forth to perform. And when 
you write to the missionaries, your 
sons and daughters, write letters 
that are encouraging, and don't 
write things that will make them 
homesick. That feeling does not 
come from our Father in heaven, 
and we should not be instruments 
in causing it to arise in the hearts of 
the elders. That has been one of 
the troubles we have had to contend 
with, people at home writing things 
that have a tendency to discourage 
the elders. The people at home 
should assist the elders in keeping 
the spirit of their mission and call- 
ing. 

I love the work of the Lord, the 
work in that mission, and every el- 
der engaged in it ; they are united 
and willing. Thev are men of God, 
working for the buildine up of His 
Church and Kingdom, and they are 
not idlers. I don't know of one in- 
stance of an elder that is not doing 
his duty at the present time, to the 
best of his ability. They are try- 
ing to keep the commandments of 
the Lord, and laboring zealouslv. 
Ninety per cent of the elders in that 
mission travel without purse or 
scrip ; today you could find about a 
hundred and twenty of these younp- 
men trudging through that countrv, 



from north to south, without mon- 
ey, preaching the Gospel, delivering 
tracts, holding meetings and dispos- 
ing of books. The Lord is blessing 
them, and they seldom have to sleep 
out of doors. We have recently 
held four conferences, and I think 
that not more than three of our el- 
ders reported that they have laid 
out during the past six months. I 
tell you, the Lord will bless any 
man who goes out to preach His 
Gospel according to the method that 
He has commanded, that is without 
purse or scrip, especially where you 
can. We have some places, how- 
ever, where our elders are not per- 
mitted to travel without purse or 
scrip, but in those cases the respon- 
sibility is not upon our shoulders. 
If we are faithful in our labors no 
one can arise and accuse us of neg- 
lect. After this life, when these el- 
ders meet any of the men or women 
to whom they have borne a faithful 
testimony, and have said to them, 
"I want you to read these books of 
ours, and place yourselves in a po- 
sition to see whether we are right 
or wrong ; read the Book of Mor- 
mon and these pamphlets," if we do 
that, they can not rise up in the 
eternal world and accuse us of neg- 
lect of duty. Among the bright 
young men who have come out to 
help us in the last six months are 
some who have attended colleges, 
and had experience in various avo- 
cations in life, which makes them 
the more valuable. A man who has 
had a college education and a good 
practical experience in life, and in 
the Church of God at home, is in- 
valuable. We have a few such, and 
it seems as if we cannot let them go. 
but soon, of course, we will have 
to. I trust we will get more, and 
that we will get enough elders to 
do the work we are trying to ac- 



ELDER WILLIAM W. RITER. 



71 



complish in that field. We have in 
our colony in the state of Texas 
about 500 people. There are bright, 
intelligent young persons among 
them, but we have not enough heln 
to teach them, or to labor in their 
Sunday Schools. We have one el- 
der there that is teaching school, 
and teaching music. If we could 
get at least two sisters, faithful >nd 
solid in the faith, who could go 
down there and teach some of those 
young ladies how to teach these 
young people in the Sabbath school 
and in the associations, it would be 
a great blessing - . The elders who 
go to that mission who have been 
good men in the community here, 
and have attended to their meetings 
and duties at home, make the best 
missionaries. We have three elder? 
from Canada, who have come into 
the mission field from active posi- 
tions in life. They had attended 
Mutual Improvement Associations, 
and each one of them could answer 
questions intelligently and perform 
any missionary work that was re- 
quired of them. That indicates that 
the people in Canada are zealous 
in the work of the Lord. 

May the blessings of the Lord 
rest upon this people and their 
leaders, and upon this conference, 
and the elders of Israel and His 
Saints everywhere, I ask in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDEE WILLIAM W. RITER. 

I was pleased to notice during 
our devotional exercises this morn - 
ing that nearly every one present 
was singing, either audibly or else 
their lips were moving in harmony 
with the hymn. I know of no bet- 
ter standard by which to judge of 
the feelings of a congregation than 



by the method in which they sing 
the familiar hymns of the Church ; 
from this I conclude that the con- 
gregation that is now before me is 
in spirit and sympathy with the 
great work of human salvation in 
which we are all interested. 

I have been very much interested 
in the remarks of the brethren in 
regard to the missions over which 
they have the pleasure and the hon- 
or to preside. I was somewhat 
interested in the remarks of Broth- 
er Pratt, for the reason that they 
tallied and fitted so exactly with 
some of my early experiences in 
the missionary field ; but I was glad 
to know that the exceptions he 
noted were only exceptions, and 
that, as a rule, the elders of the 
Church lead very exemplary lives. 
As I have traveled out in the world, 
as I frequently do, on business and 
otherwise, wherever I have gone 
where there have been elders or 
members of the Church, I have 
usually met them ; and my experi- 
ence is, and to this I think I can 
truthfully testify, that there is a 
great improvement in their behavior 
and a great improvement and ad- 
vancement in their intelligence. I 
can remember when I was first 
called on a foreign mission, that 
there were among us forty-eight 
young men, mostly boys you might 
call them, and there was not one 
in the forty-eight that could speak 
the English language correctly. 
This is all changed now, thanks to 
our magnificent school system, 
thanks to the schools that are 
fostered by the Church, and 
thanks to the great prosperity that 
the Lord has brought upon us. The 
change is so great in this direction, 
that I have found many of our el- 
ders the peers in the pulpit of any 
men that I ever heard. My experi- 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ence has covered a considerable 
range, and these things are grati- 
fying to me. Perhaps the best 
school that we could be educated in 
is the school of experience, and 
the best method of conveying in- 
formation is by stating the opposite 
of a question. 

Now we all understand, when we 
stop to think of it, that the work of 
the Latter-day Saints, the mission 
of Joseph Smith, is to bring salva- 
tion to the world, not only to those 
who are living, and who can hear 
it in this life, but our mission is 
to bring salvation to the human 
race, whether dead or alive. This 
is a larger problem than a great 
many of us think it is. We are 
greatly engrossed by the affairs of 
life, and I think it is only now 
and then that we have time to turn 
our minds to, and con over the 
great mission whereunto we are 
called. As an item of importance 
in this connection, I call your at- 
tention to this fact, and I would 
premise, it by saying (excuse the 
apparent egotism) that I, perhaps 
as much as any one, have kept my 
eyes on the religious conditions of 
the world. I read the religious 
tracts of the day, showing: and ex- 
emplifying the religious condition 
of the people. Of course when I 
say people, I mean the Christian 
people of the earth ; as yet we have 
had very little to do with those of 
heathen lands. I discover this, 
that as the years go by there is a 
lessening and a relaxation in the 
minds of the people at large in re- 
gard to their conceptions of reli- 
gious matters. Especially is this 
true in regard to their thought re- 
garding the existence of a Deity. 
The old time faith, such as was 
once had amongst the people — I 
mean the people at large — the old 



time and simple faith that once an- 
imated a great many good people, 
seems to be passing away; and the 
conception of God is becoming 
more hazy as the years roll by. 
Their ideas concerning Him are 
becoming more shadowy, until the 
condition is realized that in some 
of what we call Christian nations 
any distinct comprehension of a 
deity has well nigh vanished. There 
is one nation in Europe, one of the 
most learned nations, I presume, 
upon the face of the earth, where 
the idea of a God, that is, any ac- 
tive idea of Him in the minds of 
the masses of the people, has well 
nigh vanished. Of course you can 
readily guess to which nation I re- 
fer ; and I will also mention its 
neighboring nation, that of Ger- 
many. I saw it stated here recent- 
ly, in one of the papers, that only 
four per cent of the people in coun- 
try sections were to be found in 
church on Sunday, and only two 
per cent were to be found in church 
in the cities. Now, ever since the 
days of the Prophet Joseph, the 
ideas of religion, and of man's con- 
nection and relationship to God, 
are becoming relaxed ,and I do not 
know how soon it will be before 
the time comes when the knowl- 
edge of God, or at least, faith in the 
great God that created the heavens 
and the earth, will become only a 
dark and shadowy memory. It was 
the great mission of the Israelites, 
the children of Abraham, through- 
out all their generations, though 
apostate as they sometimes were, 
and far removed from the true path 
sometimes, to preserve the knowl- 
edge of God uoon the earth. I 
know it has been frequently a mat- 
ter of wonder "What good is the 
Jew?" Why, if the Jew did noth- 
ing else but preserve the knowl-

edge of God upon the earth, he per- 
formed a great mission, for 
throughout all those generations in 
which he lived, the knowledge of 
God would have completely per- 
ished from the earth except for 
them, and the world would have 
had in the place thereof only gods 
of "sticks and stones." 

Now, my brothers and sisters, if 
we as Latter-day Saints had no oth- 
er mission in the world than to pre- 
serve a knowledge of God upon the 
earth, that of itself is a great mis- 
sion. If we had no other calling 
than to preserve simple faith in the 
providences of God, that of itself 
is a great calling. But fortunately 
it extends much further than this. 
Our mission, as I have already re- 
ferred to, covers the welfare of the 
whole human family, in all ages of 
the world; and I believe that if the 
Latter-day Saints could properly 
look at this subject, they would re- 
gard themselves with considerable 
pride as the upholders of the true 
faith and preservers of the knowl- 
edge of God on the earth. 

I have been greatly pleased with 
the spirit of this conference. I am 
convinced of this fact, which is, 
never since the church was organ- 
ized was there as general good 
feeling amongst the Latter-day 
Saints, as general a feeling of un- 
animity, and as little fault-finding, 
and as little cause for fault-finding 
as at the present time. It may not 
be amiss for me to state a few rea- 
sons for these conclusions. During 
the existence of the old Salt Lake 
Stake, which is now divided into 
several stakes, it became one of my 
duties to be an auditor of the ac- 
counts of the different wards in the 
stake. In this labor I had occasion 
to go over the list of tithepayers, 
and those who made donations to 



the Relief Society and to other 
charities amongst the Latter-day 
Saints ; and I have been surprised 
to see with what generality, and I 
might say, generosity, the people 
have paid their tithes and offerings. 
In looking over the names of peo- 
ple in some of the wards with 
which I was most familiar, I have 
frequently asked the Bishop, How 
can so-and-so pay any tithes and 
offerings, knowing their poverty? 
It is surprising that, sometimes, 
people in the most humble circum- 
stances of life, whom I have known 
and knew that their earnings were 
but little, that the amount of their 
donations and charities were sur- 
prisingly large, and that this occurs 
generally. Then, since the division 
of the stake, it has fallen to my lot 
for two years past, to be one of the 
auditors of the accounts of the gen- 
eral organization of the Church ; 
and I think I may perhaps, with- 
out violating any confidence what- 
ever, say that the conditions in 
which we have found things are 
gratifying almost beyond measure. 
I believe that there is not a person 
present in this congregation, or any 
congregation of the Saints, to 
whom, if they could see the gen- 
erosity with which the people re- 
spond to these calls, and then see 
the wisdom and the judgment with 
which their moneys and their dona- 
tions, are disbursed, it would not be 
a source of gratification. The peo- 
ple, I believe, as never before, are 
paying their tithes and offerings 
and living up to the requirements 
of their faith. 

There is one thing that struck me 
with extreme gratification, and that 
is the generous help that the gener- 
al authorities of the Church have 
extended to our educational insti- 
tutions. We have amongst us a 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



number of colleges and academies, 
and I think the day will soon pass 
away when men will have to speak, 
in any degree of complaint of the 
quality of the missionaries that are 
sent out into the field. The cause 
of education is close and dear to 
the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, 
their children are becoming educat- 
ed, and it is only a question of time 
when the old reproach that used to 
be thrown at us, that the Latter- 
day Saints were ignorant, will pass 
away. Strange as it may appear, 
there was a statement in one of the 
New York papers some months ago 
complaining that the elders of the 
Latter-day Saints sent out into the 
world were educated men, and in 
consequence of that they were the 
more dangerous. It is only a 
question of time when that com- 
plaint will be general, and the mis- 
sionaries that go out into the field 
will be men of culture and educa- 
tion, for the reason that there will 
be none at home, none from among 
whom they have come that are oth- 
erwise. We have great cause for 
congratulation, mjy brothers and 
sisters. Let us persevere, and let 
us have hope for the future. The 
future never looked as bright as it 
dees today for the great cause of 
human salvation. May God help 
us in this cause always, is my 
paryer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 

(President of Mexican Mission.) 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, 
to express the gratitude I feel to 
our heavenly Father that I am per- 
mitted, in connection with you, to 



be here in this general conference 
of the Church, that we are permit- 
ted to meet and worship the Lord 
without molestation, for, strange as 
it may appear, this blessing, this 
privilege, has not always been ac- 
corded to the Saints of God. Why 
people should object to men and 
women meeting together and wor- 
shiping their Creator as their con- 
science may dictate to them, seems 
strange, but it is nevertheless a fact 
that in the history of the world re- 
ligious worship has been interfered 
with and the right of conscience has 
been interrupted to a degree that 
no other privilege of the human 
race has been ; and so I say, when 
we are permitted thus to meet to 
worship the Lord, to acknowledge 
His goodness and mercy to us, 
without molestation, I feel exceed- 
ingly grateful, as I believe that you 
all do, and want to make this ac- 
knowledgement to our heavenly 
Father 'this morning. 

I am grateful to have the oppor- 
tunity of saying just a few words 
in behalf of your brethren and sis- 
ters who are in Mexico, people iso- 
lated from the body of the Church, 
surrounded by influences different 
to those that exist in any other or- 
ganized stake of the church. In 
fact, there is no other Latin coun- 
try in the world where there is a 
stake of Zion organized ; and we 
should appreciate the conditions 
which exist where Latin races and 
Latin customs prevail ; they are 
so different from the customs 
which exist in Anglo-Saxon com- 
munities that one must be- 
come acquainted with them to ful- 
ly appreciate them. Mexico is a 
very peculiar country, comprising 
very distinct, peculiar and contra- 
dictory conditions. The country it- 
self is one of extreme contrast. Vast

arid, unproductive plains abound, 
which to look at one would think 
to be absolutely valueless, and yet 
when the country is traced and ex- 
amined we find that it is inter- 
spersed and dotted with valleys as 
productive as any elsewhere in the 
world. Great treeless ranges of 
mountains, appearing to be without 
any valuable products, when more 
closely examined, are found to con- 
tain in their recesses mostbeautiful 
and productive forests ; and some of 
the mountains are covered with per- 
petual snow, around the bases of 
which oranges, lemons, and bananas 
are cultivated. It is a country of 
extremely distressing drought, fol- 
lowed by prolific rains, and so the 
country from north to south is one 
of extreme and perplexing condi- 
tions. It is not very strange that 
a people who have lived in a coun- 
try of this kind for hundreds of 
years should become somewhat like 
it ; environment has had its effect 
and they have become as it is. I 
suppose there is no place in the 
world where greater extremes are 
found among the population, where 
a more heterogeneous people live 
than are to be found in Mexico. 
And yet, taken as a whole, it seems 
harmonious, and when considered 
together it appears reasonably hom- 
ogeneous. 

Mexico has a great interest to the 
Latter-day Saints from the fact that 
it is the home of the Lamanite, 
the land of the Nephite. There are 
millions of those people,the dark de- 
scendants of father Lehi, there. The 
center of civilization upon the North 
American continent at the time of 
its discovery was in the Valley of 
Mexico ; and there are to be found 
today, upon the paved streets of its 
principal city, surrounded with 
wealth equal to that perhaps of any 



other city of the same size in the 
world, Aztec women pattering along 
the pavements, dressed exactly as 
they were four hundred years ago 
when Cortez marched into the city 
at the head of his victorious army. 
And there, in sight of the towers of 
those temples and magnificent edi- 
fices which have been erected by the 
Catholic church, the humble hamlets 
of the Indians may be seen, scat- 
tered over the mountain sides ; and 
they are living in the same sim- 
plicity, speaking the same language, 
wearing the same apparel, following 
the same avocations, that they did 
in the days of their fore-fathers. 

We are doing some missionary 
work among these people, and it is 
interesting to the Latter-day Saints 
at large to know that many of them 
are receiving the Gospel. They are 
a vigorous race, mentally and phy- 
sically, thoroughly competent both 
physically and intellectually to com- 
prehend the Gospel and fulfil their 
part in the upbuilding of the 
Church, in connection with converts 
that are made in other countries. If 
we read the words of the Lord as 
contained in the Book of Mormon — 
and Mexico is essentially a Book of 
Mormon country — we find that a 
time must come, before the consum- 
mation of the purposes of the Lord, 
before the redemption of the center 
stake of Zion, before completing the 
work we are so anxionsly looking 
forward to down there at Independ- 
ence, Missouri, that the work of 
conversion must be commenced 
among the Lamanites. Jesus said 
to His disciples, when He minis- 
tered among them upon this conti- 
nent, that He would give them a 
sign by which they might know 
when the things that He then pre- 
dicted were about to be fulfilled, and 
He said : 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"When these words which I now speak 
unto you, and which you shall write, 
shall be brought forth in latter times, 
and when they shall be brought to a 
remnant of your seed which shall dwin- 
dle in unbelief, and your seed shall be- 
gin to come to a knowledge of these 
things, and know that their fathers came 
from Jerusalem, and that they are of 
the house of Israel, then may you know 
that the promises which I have made re- 
garding the redemption of my people, O 
ye house of Israel, are about to be ful- 
filled." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we 
have a dozen elders laboring down 
there among that people, and they 
are making converts every day. So 
we see that the Gospel has be.en in- 
troduced among them, that they are 
coming to a knowledge of the truth, 
that they again know that their 
fathers came from Jerusalem, that 
they do begin to realize the day of 
their redemption draweth nigh, and 
thus we see in them the fulfillment 
of Scripture. As a people we are 
fulfillers of Scripture. If there is 
anything at all in the work of the 
Lord, it is here for the purpose of 
consummating His purposes, in ful- 
fillment of the words of the proph- 
ets, preparing for the redemption 
of the covenant people of the Lord 
in this the dispensation of the full- 
ness of times. Now if you will 
read the Doctrine and Covenants, 
you will find that also justifies what 
I have said. The Lord revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph that 
this people to whom I refer should 
become a very active factor in the 
redemption of the center stake of 
Zion, and the construction of a 
great temple there in this dispensa- 
tion, this generation. Taken alto- 
gether, we feel very much encour- 
aged with the outlook, from a mis- 
sionary standpoint, in Mexico. If 
it were not for that fact, were it 
not for the faith we have that the 



Lord wants us to be in Mexico for 
the accomplishment of His pur- 
poses, we would not be there, for 
there is nothing very desirable in 
that country nor in the people. The 
conditions there are so contrary to 
those conditions to which we have 
been accustomed that it would 
not be desirable to us. Were it not 
for the conviction we have that the 
Lord desires that the Gospel should 
be established and maintained 
among that people, we would not 
feel content to be there. There are 
about 4,000 Latter-day Saints there, 
without including the members of 
the Church who live in the neigh- 
borhood of the city of Mexico, and 
who number five or six hundred. 
Our people are doing the best they 
can to maintain themselves, to sus- 
tain their families and properly edu- 
cate their children. We are getting 
no help at all from the government, 
not a single dollar has ever been ex- 
pended for public purposes" in the 
part of Mexico where we live, since 
we have been there. We maintain 
our own schools, we construct our 
own roads, we build our own 
bridges, we pay our own civil offi- 
cers; in fact, we bear all the bur- 
dens of government, and receive in 
exchange the protection of the law. 
Our relationship with the Mexican 
government is very friendly, indeed. 
We have no difficulty with them, 
we participate in no degree at all 
in their politics. We let politics en- 
tirely alone, attending to our own 
affairs ; and I suppose we might live 
in peace in almost any country un- 
der similar circumstances. We pay 
our taxes, bear our own expenses, 
and are permitted to live in peace. 
That just about explains it all. It 
is not without an effort, either, that 
we do this, because we are the poor- 
est people in the Church, taken as 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IV INS. 



77 



a whole, and yet these poor people 
support an excellent school in each 
ward in the stake ; and we maintain 
a stake academy, which is perhaps 
equal to almost any other that exists 
in the Church, a splendid adminis- 
tration, a splendid school. In order 
to accomplish all this we are some- 
times required to assess a voluntary 
income tax upon the people, as high 
as five or six per cent of their in- 
come. But it is willingly paid, and 
the schools are maintained. We ap- 
preciate the fact that, isolated as we 
are, if we expect to keen in touch 
with our brethren and sisters in 
more favored localities in the 
Church, we must educate our chil- 
dren, and we are trying our very 
best to do it. I want to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, you who 
perhaps are better able to amply 
provide for education, among whom 
it is possible, do not allow your pre- 
judices, do not allow the argument 
that education is being overdone, to 
persuade you to desist from per- 
sistent effort to properly educate the 
children of the Latter-day Saints. I 
tell you we never have been an over- 
educated people. The time will not 
come that we can properly fill the 
place the Lord designs we should 
occupy among the people of the 
earth until greater attention is paid 
to education. 

We have been pre-eminently an 
agricultural people. I do not want 
to depreciate agriculture. I do not 
want to deny the fact that, from an 
agricultural standpoint, our educa- 
tional institutions may be very 
greatly improved, and we are try- 
ing all the time to improve them 
down in our country; but I do 
want to call your attention to the 
other fact that no pre-eminently ag- 
ricultural people ever took first 
place among the nations of the 



earth. It is people who know how- 
to do, who know how to manufac- 
ture, who know how to take the ele- 
ments of the earth and make them 
into things useful for men and 
women,that have been the civilized 
nations of the earth. Egypt had the 
world's first civilization, and the 
people of Egypt were pre-eminently 
agricultural. But the manufactur- 
ing city of Tyre and the little city 
of Sidon, whose inhabitants pulled 
down the cedars of their mountains 
and made them into ships, who 
knew enough to take the ore of the 
earth and convert it into iron and 
bind ships together, who were able 
to manufacture it into things that 
people wanted, they were the peo- 
ple who forged to the front. There 
is no country in the world where 
agriculture is more appreciated than 
in England. There is no country 
in the world whose influence for 
good, towards the betterment and 
civilization of the inhabitants of the 
earth, has been felt as strongly as 
that of the English people ; I say it 
without fear of successful contra- 
diction. But it has never been her 
agriculture that made it possible 
for her civilizing influence to go to 
all the world. England is the great- 
est manufacturing country on the 
earth. It was because she had 
mines and knew how to work them, 
and had factories and knew how to 
conduct and operate them; I know 
this. I have felt impressed that the 
Latter-day Saints have neglected 
some of their opportunities, and the 
result is that the most remunerative 
employment goes to others. What 
do we know about engineering? 
What do we know about electricity ? 
What do we know about manufac- 
turing? As a community we do- 
very little indeed in these lines, and 
the result is that the advantages- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have largely been secured by oth- 
ers, and we are, in a measure, bear- 
ers of burdens that others ought to 
share with us. 

I believe these great forces have 
come into the world to stay. I do 
not believe that when the redemp- 
tion of Zion comes, and when truth 
triumphs, that all the great discov- 
eries which make for the betterment 
of mankind are going to be rele- 
gated to the back ground, not a bit 
of it. Electricity has come to stay, 
the power of steam has come to 
stay. The power to control these 
things must be acquired by the peo- 
ple who would be in the fore- 
ground. We must progress. Take 
Nelson or Paul Jones and put them 
in a modern man-of-war, and what 
would they do? They would be as 
helpless as babes, because conditions 
are changed, and conditions are con- 
tinually changing, and we have got 
to take advantage of the conditions 
to make our way in the world. 

Let us see to it that our sons and 
daughters are educated men and 
women, and that they compare fa- 
vorably with educated men and 
women that go out from other com- 
munities. And that need not de- 
tract from our faith. A man said 
to me the other day, "When you 
come to insist upon these material 
things, you destroy the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints." In other words 
the argument is made that you can- 
not educate the people and still have 
them retain their faith in the Gos- 
pel. That is nonsense. The Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ comprehends 
every truth there is in the world, 
educationally, morally, physiologi- 
cally, all that we can attain. The 
Prophet Joseph laid the maxim 
down to us, that everything that 
was good, everything that was ex- 
cellent, everything that, made for 



the betterment of mankind, be- 
longed to us, and it was our duty to 
acquire it. 

May God bless us, my brethren 
and sisters, and keep us in the faith. 
I rejoice in the Gospel, and bear 
testimony to its truth. I wish you 
to sustain us, your brethren and sis- 
ters down in Mexico, with your 
faith and prayers, that we may all 
unite for the upbuilding of the king- 
dom of God and the consummation 
of His purposes. May the blessings 
of the Lord rest upon us all, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 

During the time I. occupy this po- 
sition, I desire to be safeguarded 
by the Holy Spirit of God. I have 
no desire whatever to say or do 
anything that can be construed to 
hurt the Church. I am perfectly 
willing to bear my individual res- 
ponsibilities, but I believe a res- 
ponsibility rests upon every man 
and woman in the Church of Christ 
to protect the Church, although I 
am confident that the Lord is amply- 
able to take care of the Church of 
Latter-day Saints, whether we suc- 
ceed or fail: I have that faith. 

I am a strong advocate of indi- 
viduality and agency. I value it 
above everything that I can con- 
ceive of, except salvation. I am 
very doubtful if a man can be 
saved in the kingdom of God who 
has no individuality, and does not 
assert his agency, because salvation 
is an individual work. This is the 
Church of Jesus Christ, and is no 
man's Church. It does not belong 
to President Joseph F. Smith, and 
he does not pretend to say that it 
does ; nor to his counselors, nor to 
the, - Twelve Apostles ; it is the 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



79 



Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, and I am sure that the 
Lord will take care of it, no matter 
what we do, whether we do right 
or wrong. 

It is my desire to read to you an 
«xcerpt taken from a magazine ; I 
do not wish you to get the idea that 
it is scripture. I presume some of 
•our enemies would like to take issue 
with us on the ground that we have 
no right to go outside of the Bible, 
Doctrine and Covenants, Book of 
Mormon, and Pearl of Great Price 
for texts to be used in the pulpit. 
I read as follows : — 

"I believe that a question of 
super-eminent importance has been 
raised, the question whether the 
pulpit shall be free or whether the 
pulpit shall not be free. The 
whole question of the churches is 
involved in this question. 

"The chief office of a minister, I 
take it, is not to represent the views 
of the congregation, but to pro- 
claim the truth as he sees it. How 
can he serve a congregation as a 
teacher save as he quickens the 
minds of the hearers by the vitality 
and independence of his utter- 
ances? But how can a man be 
vital and independent and helpful 
if he be tethered and muzzled? . . .. 
The minister is not to be the 
spokesman of the congregation, not 
the message bearer of the congre- 
gation, but the bearer of a message 
to the congregation. 

"We are all muzzled by civiliza- 
tion. It is unlawful to speak evil 
of our neighbor. To refer to his 
conduct or business injuriously is 
libelous. It is also dangerous so- 
cially. The newspapers are muz- 
zled ; they cannot print 'all the 
news,' or one per cent, of the news ; 
the lawyers, doctors, politicians, 
merchants, housewives — all are 
muzzled. An effective cartoon 



might depict a muzzled clergyman 
preaching to a muzzled congrega- 
tion. 

"The fact is that a civilization is 
a compromise. We waive certain 
natural rights for security in the 
possession of other rights. Among 
the waived rights is the right of 
free speech. You can say anything 
you like on a desert island ; in town 
you cannot. And upon the whole 
most of us prefer to live in town, 
muzzles and all. 

"What shall we say then ? Shall 
we sacrifice truth to conventionality 
and prudence? As a matter of 
fact, we do continually. How far 
it is justifiable to suppress or color 
religious truth (if we divide truth 
into sections) in order to maintain 
the modus Vivendi rests ultimately 
on the individual conscience." 

It is not my intention to decide 
"that we are all muzzled by civili- 
zation," nor "the fact that civiliza- 
tion is a compromise," but my con- 
viction is that this people have 
"waived certain natural rights," as 
well as religious rights "for se- 
curity in the possession of other 
rights." 

The chief point I have in mind 
at this time is that when we became 
members of the Church of Latter- 
day Saints we waived certain rights 
and privileges. At least that was 
my understanding when I became a 
member of the Church. Of course, 
my case is different from those of 
our people who were converted to 
the Gospel in the world, as I had 
no choice in the matter. I was 
born in Salt Lake City in 1853, and 
when eight years old was baptized 
and became a member of the 
Church. It was hardly a voluntary 
action on my part at that time, al- 
though I strongly believe, as El- 
der John Nicholson has said, "that 
Latter-day Saints are born and not 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made." I am hopeful that the Gos- 
pel has found its way into every 
fiber of my being, as I truly love 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints and its organization, 
and am thoroughly converted that 
the Priesthood and authority of 
God has again been restored to the 
earth. I love the people, and hope 
the day will never come in my life 
and history that my integrity and 
devotion to the truth of the Gospel 
will ever be in question. 

Now, as I said, I waived certain 
rights when I became a member of 
this Church; I waived the right of 
sin. I had my agency and indi- 
viduality; but as long as I am a 
member of this Church, I waive 
the right to sin, to transgress. 
When you joined the Church, be- 
came members of it, you also waiv- 
ed the right to do a great many 
things. You have no right to 
break the ten commandments, have 
you ? You have no right to be 
dishonest. You have no right to 
commit adultery, or to be immoral. 
You have waived all these rights. 
You have waived the right to 
break the Word of Wisdom. And 
in many other things we have 
waived our rights, and sometimes 
I feel muzzled when I wrestle with 
my nature and human weaknesses. 
You know there is no other man 
just like me in all Israel, and prob- 
ably you are glad of it. I am hav- 
ing a pretty hard time wrestling 
with myself. I don't feel self- 
righteous; I feel more like that 
poor fellow who stood on the street 
corner and bowed his head and 
said, "O God, forgive me, a poor 
sinner." I feel confident, when I 
think about the matter carefully, 
that some people become self-right- 
eous in their own estimation, be- 
cause they keep one or two or more 
commandments they then com- 



mence to exercise "unrighteous 
dominion" when they find a trans- 
gressor in the Church. Now, Lat- 
ter-day Saints, you have all "sinned 
and come short of the glory of 
God," and you stand condemned 
before the Lord unless there is such 
a thing as repentance and forgive- 
ness of sins. It is a question, How 
long will it take for me to secure 
salvation? The Lord only knows ; 
I don't: I am not competent to tell 
whether I will be saved or not. I 
am making an effort for sal- 
vation, and, as I said, I waived a 
great many rights in order to be- 
come a member of the Church. I 
have trampled ambition under my 
feet, for I have an am- 
bition, and it takes me 
all the time to keep my feet on 
it. I am sometimes afraid of my 
friends, because if one don't quali- 
fy every statement he makes, he 
may be like one man said of me in 
the north country: "Well, he didn't 
say it but he intended to. and if he 
will say to me that he did not in- 
tend to say it, then I will take back 
everything I said against him." 

I wish to properly express my 
thoughts and feelings cm this oc- 
casion. I will read to you from 
the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Behold, there are many called, 
but few are chosen, and why are 
they not chosen?" 

(I have been surprised that I 
was chosen, but there will come 
another time of choosing', and I 
don't know whether I will be 
among the number then or not. 
You don't know, either.) 

"There are many called, but few 
are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? Because their hearts 
are set so much upon the things of 
this world, and aspire to the honors 
of men, that they do not learn this 
one lesson : That the rights of the 
priesthood are inseparably connect-

ed with the powers of heaven." 
Our hearts are set so much upon 
the things of this world and aspire 
to the honors of men;" that is our 
weakness, the weakness of the 
human family. If you ever change 
some men along that line you will 
have to grind them over, for they 
have got it burned into their souls, 
and they love the honors of men. 
As I stand before you today, I do 
not love the honors of men, but I 
honor God, and want to keep His 
commandments. 

"And they do not learn this one 
lesson" — and it is the hardest thing 
in the world to learn — "that the 
rights of the priesthood are insep- 
arably connected with the powers 
of heaven, and that the powers of 
heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of 
righteousness. That they may be 
conferred upon us, it is true; but 
when we undertake to cover our 
sins, or to gratify our pride, our 
vain ambition, or to exercise con- 
trol or dominion, or compulsion, 
upon the souls of the children of 
men, in any degree of unrighteous- 
ness, behold, the heavens withdraw 
themselves ; the spirit of the Lord 
is grieved; and when it is with- 
drawn, amen to the Priesthood or 
the authority of that man." 

It matters not what position a 
man holds in the Church, if he uses 
any unrighteous dominion it is 
amen to the Priesthood that he 
holds, which is inseparably connect- 
ed with heaven, and we should be- 
gin to learn it now. 

"Behold ! ere he is aware, He is 
left unto himself to kick against 
the pricks ; to persecute the saints, 
and to fight against God. We have 
learned, by sad experience, that it 
is the nature and disposition of 
almost all men, as soon as they get 
a little authority, as they suppose, 



they will immediately begin to ex- 
ercise unrighteous dominion. 
Hence many are called but few are 
chosen." 

"No power or influence can or 
ought to be maintained by virtue 
of the Priesthood, only by persua- 
sion, by longsuffering, by gentle- 
ness, and meekness, and by love 
unfeigned; by kindness and pure 
knowledge, which shall greatly en- 
large the soul without hypocrisy, 
and without guile." 

I grant you that men holding au- 
thority have a right to reprove 
sharply, but they must be sure that 
they are moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost. 

"Reproving betimes .with sharp- 
ness, when moved upon by the 
Holy Ghost, and then showing 
forth afterwards an increase of 
love toward him whom thou hast 
reproved, lest he esteem thee to be 
an enemy; that he may know that 
thy faithfulness is stronger than 
the cords of death. Let thy bowels 
also be full of charity towards all 
men, and to the household of faith, 
and let virtue garnish thy thoughts 
unceasingly, then shall thy confi- 
dence wax strong in the presence 
of God, and the doctrine of the 
Priesthood shall distil upon thy 
soul as the dews from heaven." 

Experience teaches me that when 
I have been angry, I am quite sure 
I did not have the Holy Ghost, and 
I was not in any proper condition 
to administer reproof. It took me 
quite a long while to learn that. 
When I became excited, fanatical, 
and over-zealous, I mistakenly 
thought it was the Spirit of the 
Lord, but have learned better, as 
the Holy Ghost does not operate 
that way. My testimony is that the 
internal fruits of the Holy Ghost 
are joy, peace, patience, long suf- 
fering, and kindness.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I hold the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood ; I have the information by 
which I can trace my authority 
back to Joseph Smith, the Prophet. 
Elder William Moore Allred or- 
dained me a Seventy ; Levi W. 
Hancock ordained Elder Allred to 
the priesthood, and Elder Hancock 
was ordained by Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet. Now, I am speaking of 
myself ; I am not criticizing others ; 
I am talking about principles. 
I stand before you a transgressor, 
but I am trying to be saved, and 
that is all God asks me to do. Any 
man who tries to do the right thing 
and continues to try, is not a fail- 
ure in the sight of God. Dreyfus 
a Jew of the French Army, was 
falsely accused by his associates 
because of jealousy and hatred, and 
it resulted in his losing his appoint- 
ment, being disgraced and ban- 
ished. He was afterwards proven 
innocent and reinstated with hon- 
ors. His experience and sorrow 
would not be as great or as serious 
as mine would be, if, for cause or 
otherwise, I was to lose my Priest- 
hood and appointment. Such 
things have occurred through sin, 
or apostasy, and sometimes it may 
be because men holding the Priest- 
hood have exercised unrighteous 
dominion, and have accepted state- 
ments made by tattlers, and thus 
become suspicious, prejudiced and 
unfriendly. 

My brethren and sisters, I want 
you to be good to me, and help 
save me. If I can be saved it is an 
encouragement to every man, wo- 
man and child in Israel to make the 
effort. If you have weaknesses, 
try and overcome them, and if you 
fail, try again, and if you then fail, 
keep trying, for God is merciful to 
His children. He is a good deal 
kinder to us than we are to our- 
selves, more kind to us, perhaps 



than some who hold the priesthood 
are to each other. I have learned 
the lesson that nothing on earth 
would be a greater failure to me 
than to fail to keep my family in 
the Church. They were God's 
children before they were mine, and 
I think the Lord will look after 
their interests and save them in 
His own due time. If Golden Kim- 
ball, can't be saved in the flesh, 
after all the struggles and efforts 
he has made — and I have made 
a few sacrifices — then I believe 
God will save him on the other side, 
and it may be that his earthly father 
will come to his rescue, and lift up 
his voice to God in behalf of his 
child and plead for his salvation. It 
may take a hundred years to save 
me, but if I get through in a thou- 
sand years it will be a most profit- 
able investment. I have no fancied 
notions ; I have gotten rid of tradi- 
tion, and of a few false ideas that 
rested on me. I do not expect to 
become a god, right away. No, it 
will take a long time; I am too 
ignorant. When I stand before my 
Maker, in the other world, I 
will be like some of those 
poor Elders who have been labor- 
ing in missions, I will speak with 
a stammering tongue, and God will 
look upon me. no doubt, as a child, 
mediocre in intelligence compared 
with those who have preceded 
me. 

I conclude my remarks by brief- 
ly calling your attention to diffi- 
culties that the First Council are 
meeting in selecting the names of 
Seventies from the many quorums 
of Seventy for missions. Letters of 
inquiry are sent to them to ascer- 
tain as to their moral, spiritual, 
financial and physical condition, 
and as to their willingness to ac- 
cept a call from the Presidency of 
the Church for a mission. A -very

great effort is being made by the 
brethren to protect the interest of 
our people at home, as we are no 
longer in possession of all the busi- 
ness interests in the State of Utah, 
but are met with sharp competition^ 
and unless great care is taken to 
protect these interests, our people 
will be the "hewers of wood and 
drawers of water." Also we find 
many Seventies living in cities 
and other places as employees, and 
as soon as they are called on mis- 
sions, their families are left with- 
out means of livelihood. The Lord 
has said "that men who will not 
provide for their own are worse 
than an infidel, and has already 
denied the faith," and as there is 
no plan established for a mission- 
ary fund, such men cannot very 
well be called on missions. Besides, 
the Stakes and Wards of Zion must 
be protected, as well as the home 
circle, as it sometimes happens that 
fathers go on missions and their 
children lose the faith. We, also ex- 
cuse Seventies who'are aged, physi- 
cally disqualified, financially dis- 
abled, and others who are in debt 
and their homes mortgaged, so that 
you can readily understand how 
difficult it is to secure missionaries 
who have had experience and 
are qualified to preach the 
Gospel, There are many pa- 
thetic stories that might be 
told as to the unfaltering, 
unwavering faith of many of our 
brethren of the Seventies, as well 
as their wives and children, who 
are willing to make any sacrifice in 
order to preach the Gospel to the 
children of men. They have not 
forgotten that the Gospel found 
them in foreign lands through the 
efforts of other Elders who have 
made greater sacrifices than Seven- 
ties are called upon to make at the 
present time. These Seventies are 



sometimes, from a human point of 
view, disqualified because they are 
not educated, but we feel confident 
that the Lord is well pleased with 
His Seventies when they manifest 
a willingness to leave everything 
that they hold dear to go forth 
among the children of men, and 
testify of this great work. 

I pray the Lord to bless you. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and each 
nation, 

And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder James W. Ure. 



Second Overflow Meeting.

In the Assembly Hall at 2 p. m. 
Elder Hyrum M, Smith presiding. 

The singing was efficiently ren- 
dered by the Temnle choir. Before 
the close of the services, the pre- 
siding officer announced that the 
music of all the hymns that were 
sung had been composed, or har- 
monized, by the conductor, Prof. 
Charles J. Thomas. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

Jesus, mighty King in Zion, 
Thou alone our guide shalt be ; 

Thy commission we rely on, 
We will follow none but Thee. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Henry Beal. 

The choir sang the hymn :

Go, ye messengers of glory ; 

Run, ye legates of the skies ; 
Go and tell the pleasing story, 

That a glorious angel flies, 
Great and mighty, 

With a message from the skies. 



ELDER JOSEPH A. M'RAE. 

(President of Western States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, there 
have been many thoughts pass 
through my mind during the time 
that this conference has been in ses- 
sion, and I am truly thankful to my 
Father in heaven that I have had 
the opportunity of attending the 
meetings which have been held. I 
have rejoiced in the testimonies that 
have been borne by my brethren, 
and I rejoiced in the declaration 
that was read the first day of the 
conference by Brother Whitney, 
the declaration by the President 
and his counselors, that was ac- 
cepted by the body of the Church 
in conference assembled. When that 
document was *being read I could 
not help but reflect on- the first 
hymn in the book : 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee ; 

Lo ! Zion's standard is unfurled ! 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world. 

The clouds of error disappear 
Before the rays of truth divine ; 

The glory, bursting from afar, 

Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 

The Gentile fullness now comes in, 
And Israel's blessings are at hand : 

Lo ! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin, 
Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

Jehovah speaks ! let earth give ear, 
And Gentile nations turn and live; 

His mighty arm is making bare, 
His cov'nant people to receive. 



Angels from heaven and truth from 
earth 

Have met and both have record borne ; 
Thus Zion's light is bursting forth, 
To cheer her children's glad return. 

It seemed to me that a dawning 
of another day had come upon us, 
and that we are beginning a new era 
in the organization of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I wonder in my mind what influ- 
enced each of you to come to con- 
ference. I know why I came. It 
was to become acquainted and to be 
associated with you, to partake of 
the Spirit,that I might return again 
to the mission field over which I 
have been called to preside, and 
tell the people there, the elders, the 
Saints and those who are not mem- 
bers of the Church, what a glori- 
ous time we have had. 

In sitting here this afternoon, 
looking over this congregation, see- 
ing throngs of people that are pass- 
ing to and fro on the outside, and 
realizing that many thousands are 
assembled in the tabernacle to hear 
the word of God, I could not help 
but say within myself, This people 
is of necessity a social community. 
They are not hermits, they are not 
a law unto themselves, but we each 
depend upon our brothers and sis- 
ters to a degree for strength to bear 
that portion of the kingdom that 
has been committed to our care. I 
rejoice in the Gospel of Christ, and 
in the testimony the Lord has 
blessed me with. I rejoice in the 
opportunity I have had of laboring 
in the mission field for a few years, 
presiding over some of your sons 
and daughters, directing their foot- 
steps and teaching them the Gos- 
pel, telling them how to go among 
the people and do the work which 
they are appointed to accomplish. 
In viewing the work they have done 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE.

I rejoice exceedingly. They are a 
noble band of brethren and sisters, 
doing their duty, keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord, and striv- 
ing every day of their lives to 
preach the Gospel unto those who 
do not know it. The people in our 
field are inquiring for the Gospel, 
asking for it, and listening to the 
testimony of the elders ; but we do 
not have enough elders and sisters 
to preach the Gospel in the districts 
where we have been called. We 
have, practically, three states in our 
mission that have no elders preach- 
ing in them. One has only two el- 
ders covering the entire state. Of 
course they cannot cover it as a 
whole, we have to confine them to a 
small district, which keeps them 
busy. Two other states have not 
had elders in them for three or 
four yea'rs, because we can not 
spare them. We have letters now, 
in our desk in Denver, asking for 
elders to come and preach the Gos- 
pel to the people, invitations that we 
cannot comply with. I feel that the 
Gospel is spreading abroad in the 
land. I often ask the Elders in the 
mission field, Are we keeping pace 
with the rapid progress that the 
Gospel is making? Are we keep- 
ing up with this great movement 
that has been established by our 
Father in heaven? Are we keeping 
the commandments of the Lord, so 
that we can go back into the pres- 
ence of our Father in heaven with 
those who shall be received in His 
kingdom? When I see the rapid 
strides that are being made in the 
mission field, and the progress of 
the people, I wonder if our friends 
and relatives at home, who are of- 
fering up prayers and petitions for 
our welfare, realize what is being 
accomplished today by the mission- 
aries in the field. We have a corps 



of missionaries striving to the ut- 
most of their ability to preach the 
Gospel ; we have no place for 
drones in our hive, we have all re- 
solved to be workers in a great 
cause. I could not help but realize, 
as I said before, that our associa- 
tions together here are accomplish- 
ing good. My association with the 
mission presidents, visiting their 
headquarters, has done much for 
me, I have blessings in my heart 
for President Ellsworth, who pre- 
sides over the Northern States mis- 
sion. I say God bless him; he has 
been an inspiration in the things 
that I have learned by visiting his 
mission. When he asked me to take 
1,500 copies of the Book of Mor- 
mon, more than two years ago, 1 
thought it was more than we could 
afford to carry. So I solicited Pres- 
ident Robinson to take some off our 
hands, and I sent him 200. We kept 
the remainder on our shelves, and 
did not send them out to the mis- 
sionaries. A few months ago an 
inspiration came to me, and I de- 
cided to send each elder in the mis- 
sion six copies of the Book of Mor- 
mon, and to the conference pres- 
idents I sent twelve each. We sent 
450 Books of Mormon out in one 
week. Some of the elders said, 
'What do you want me to do with 
these?" I said, Put them in your 
grip, do anything you please, but I 
am going to send another half doz- 
en in a very short time, and follow 
that up. Some of the elders were 
at first timid and backward in their 
efforts to place the Book of Mor- 
mon before the people, and we re- 
alized that to get them to work we 
must throw responsibility upon 
them. In the 23 months preceding 
the first day of last December, we 
sold in the mission field 700 copies 
of the Book of Mormon. In the 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



four months since then we have 
sold 800. Not only that, but there 
were hundreds more of our Church 
books distributed among the peo- 
ple. The elders also had an oo- 
portunity of getting in the homes of 
the people and explaining the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel unto them. I 
wonder many times, if we, as a peo- 
ple, understand the Book of Mor- 
mon, do we comprehend what it is ? 
do we know why it was revealed in 
this dispensation? Evidently there 
was a wise purpose in it, for God 
thought it of sufficient importance 
to reveal it before the Church was 
established. Read the title page to 
that book, and observe what obliga- 
tions we are under to distribute it 
among the people. I have sent let- 
ters to the elders telling them we 
have placed the mark on disposal 
of the Book of Mormon in our mis- 
sion field during the present year at 
5,000 copies. President Ellsworth, 
I expect, will tell you a bigger story 
than that, but he has nearly three 
times the number of missionaries 
that we have. I feel thankful for 
the interest that has been taken in 
this great work. You may think 
that your sons and daughters are 
made book agents in distributing 
this book, but it is not so. We have 
elders in the mission field today 
who have been book agents before 
they went there, but while pursu- 
ing former tactics, they failed in 
getting the people to purchase the 
Book of Mormon, so they had to 
change their plan. The plan that 
they have adopted now is to hand 
the individual a Book of Mormon 
and ask him to read. It makes no 
difference what portion he reads, 
anv of it is good. As he reads it, 
the Elder stands there and silently 
prays that our Father in heaven 
will touch the heart of that indi- 



vidual and cause him to want the 
book. Invariably it has been sold 
under such conditions. They are 
not ordinary book agents, but they 
are filled with the power of the 
Lord. We believe the spirit of that 
book has permeated the hearts of 
the people. One of the elders, the 
other day, going into a dry goods 
store, took a book out of his pocket. 
He had hardly taken it out when a 
gentleman, a stranger, saw it, and 
held out his hand and said, "I have 
been looking for the Book of Mor- 
mon for months, how much is it?" 
Another instance I recall, of my 
own experience recently in the city 
of Denver. I went into a business 
house and took a book out of my 
pocket and handed it to the pro- 
prietor and. said: "Did you ever 
see that book before?" He said. 
"No; what are you going to do 
with it?" I said, "I am going to 
let you have it to read if you want 
it." He said, "All right, what is 
the price?" He wanted the book, 
and he took it. And so the people 
in our mission have become aware 
of the fact that Mormonism has 
something to give them, and they 
are inquiring after it, they are de- 
siring to learn the principles of the 
Gospel. These things that I am 
telling you about are developing the 
elders. The elder that I mentioned 
who took the book into the dry 
goods store was a timid, backward 
young man. He said, "I can't give 
a book away, I can't loan it to the 
people," and the president of the 
conference had been doing every- 
thing to get him filled with the 
spirit of the work, and he took the 
young man with him that morning, 
and decided on that peculiar action 
which resulted as I stated. We do 
not feel like book agents, but feel 
that we are going forth bearing the 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 87 



message that God has given to this 
generation. I have often said to 
the elders who are laboring in our 
mission, The Book of Mormon has 
been written as a message to this 
generation, and if we withhold that 
message from them, we will be hell 
responsible to God, as we would be 
held responsible before the courts 
of the land by withholding any let- 
ter we may have received for de- 
livery. 

I feel well in the Gospel. I feel 
to press on and do all that I can for 
the furtherance of this great cause. 
I love my brethren and sisters, and 
the principles of the Gospel, and I 
hope that I shall ever have a firm 
testimony, and not be afraid to 
stand forth and bear it wherever 
the Lord shall see fit to send me. 
May He bless us and help us to do 
right and keen His commandments, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

( President of Northern States Mis- 
sion.) 

I do not believe I ever attended a 
conference which has appeared to 
me to be of more importance than 
the present one, nor at which I re- 
ceived more inspiration and felt 
more impressed concerning the po- 
sition of God's people throughout 
all nations. The reading of the 
Declaration at the opening of this 
conference, seems to place us in a 
different position before the peo- 
ple of the world, and I am confident 
that the SDirit and import of the 
same will reach to the ends of the 
earth. All the world will know 
more clearly our position toward 



the children of men than ever be- 
fore. I thank God that our breth- 
ren, the First Presidency, have 
made this declaration to the people 
of the world, that it was approved 
by the Quorum of the Twelve, and 
that it has been sustained in this 
conference unanimously. I am sure 
that the spirit of the declaration 
will be felt throughout the earth, 
for it is a message of truth, bearing 
the stamp of authority. It is a 
mighty testimony to the honest in 
heart and to those who desire to 
know the truth; and I rejoice in it. 
My heart rejoices in the spirit of 
this conference, and in the powerful 
teachings that have been given unto 
God's people during the services. I 
hope and pray to live to see the day 
when the Latter-day Saints will feel 
a pride in keeping the command- 
ments of the Lord. That it will be 
a joy to keep themselves so clean 
and pure that through them the 
light of the Gospel shall be dissem- 
inated to all the honest in heart of 
the earth, that they, too, may see 
and know the way laid down by 
the Master for the salvation of His 
children. There are thousands and 
tens of thousands of honest hearted 
people in the world who are pray- 
ing and worshiping devoutly, but 
all the light and knowledge they 
have has come to them from unin- 
spired teachers, and they are not to 
blame for their state of mind. They 
have been brought up to look upon 
these self-styled teachers as men 
called of God, and to believe the 
things that have been taught by 
them. They are taught that a calf 
to preach Christ comes from the 
Holy Ghost, and that ordination is 
a secondary consideration that may 
be administered by any preacher. 
The people never stop to examine 
the abstract of title to a man's an- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



thority. If their interests were cen- 
tered in a few feet of ground they 
would look well into the title, but 
they fail to examine it in such an 
important thing as everlasting life. 
I think the time is not far distant 
when the light that shines from the 
lives of the faithful Latter-day 
Saints will draw many of the hon- 
est in heart into the straight and 
narrow path. This is the gospel of 
liberty, restored through the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. The world has 
long worshiped with a gospel of 
faith only, believing and teaching 
that faith alone is all that is neces- 
sary; but the Gospel of faith and 
works was restored through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and, as an 
evidence of this, wherever this peo- 
ple have established themselves, 
they have made their faith mani- 
fest by their works. They have 
built towns and cities, and have 
beautified the earth. They have 
gone into waste places and have 
demonstrated to the people of all 
nations that they have received a 
gospel of works as well as of faith. 
We have endeavored during the 
time we have had the privilege of 
laboring in the mission field to 
show to the people that we have 
come among them to work, to thus 
show our faith to teach them the 
better way. For several years we 
have given three rules to our mis- 
sionaries, as a means to sucess ; the 
first rule is Work, the second Hard 
work, and the third Persistent, 
prayerful, honest work. We bear 
testimony that success has come to 
every one who has followed these 
three rules. We have never had an 
elder go into the field, who has com- 
plied therewith, but who has come 
home with his heart full of joy, 
with a testimony that God lives, 
and the messengers of our Father 



have been sent before his face to 
guide his footsteps in the way of 
the honest in heart, and in the way 
of friends. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in the wonderful interest that is be- 
ing taken by the people in the 
Northern States mission, as well as 
in the other missions. I believe 
truly that it is the dawning of a 
new era, or a new opening for 
presenting the Gospel truths to the 
thousands and tens of thousands 
that desire to know the true way. 
During the past four years the peo- 
ple's attention has been wonderful- 
ly turned toward the doctrines of 
the Latter-day Saints. As evidence 
of this, we sold about twenty-five 
Books of Mormon during Febru- 
ary from the office alone, in an- 
swer to letters coming from indi- 
viduals who had met some of our 
elders. That is almost as many as 
we sold in twelve months some few 
years back ; not because the elders 
were less faithful than they are to- 
day, but because of the awakening 
of the people. I rejoice in this, and 
in the testimony that is given to me 
by the brethren who are constantly 
striving to present this great book 
of scripture to the people. They 
have related interesting and faith- 
promoting testimonies concerning 
the manner in which our heavenly 
Father has opened up the way for 
them to bring this book into the 
homes of the people. 

We are meeting hundreds of in- 
dividuals who speak in very warm 
terms concerning the work that is 
done by the Bureau of Information 
upon this block. I have had sev- 
eral intelligent persons state that 
it is very strange such a bureau was 
not established 25 years ago, so that 
much misrepresentation that has 
been going on these many years

might have been stopped. Many 
duly appreciate the very kind treat- 
ment they have received at the 
hands of our self-sacrificing breth- 
ren and sisters who come here daily 
to show people around these prem- 
ises, and to give them a little infor- 
mation concerning the doctrines 
and history of the Latter-dav 
Saints.. Some have written to us 
inquiring for other books to supple- 
ment the literature they have re- 
ceived from the Bureau of Infor- 
mation workers. 

We also receive many kind words 
from people who spend their win- 
ters on the Pacific Coast. They 
ask questions that convince us im- 
mediately that they have come in 
contact with some of our elders, for 
their questions are those referring 
to matters peculiar to the faith of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

The closing months of 1906, we 
had a very instructive and bene- 
ficial visit from our brethren, Apos- 
tle Hyrum M. Smith, and Elder 
Charles H. Hart of the First Coun- 
cil of Seventy, and I can say that 
they did us a great deal of good, 
and strengthened our mission. They 
gave the people who came to listen 
to them much valuable instruction. 
Their visit strengthened the faith 
of the Saints, assuring- them that 
the Gospel that has been delivered 
to us is a Gospel of common sense, 
a Gospel that teaches men and 
women to be natural, and that true 
religion is good common sense re- 
vealed from our Father to His 
children. 

We do not take any glory to our- 
selves for the condition that now 
prevails in the mission. We feel 
that our Father in heaven is pour- 



ing out His spirit upon the people 
throughout the nation ; the spirit of 
inquiry concerning this Gospel is 
being awakened in their hearts. All 
we have to do is to labor and seek 
earnestly to be led to those who are 
prepared to receive it. We feel 
very much encouraged in that the 
Book of Mormon, which is scrip- 
ture to this generation, is being 
widely circulated in the Northern 
States mission. We succeeded in 
distributing over 6,000 Books of 
Mormon during last year. Besides 
there was about 20,000 10-cent books 
and over 400,000 tracts distributed. 
This is a much better showing than 
we were able to make the year pre- 
vious. I do not believe our street 
meetings, or our Gospel conver- 
sations were any fewer on account 
of the increased labor in dispos- 
ing of books and tracts. The Saints 
are faithful concerning their tith- 
ing, which has steadily increased 
during the past five or six years, as 
also have the offerings of the peo- 
ple. This is evidence that God has 
implanted in the hearts of the 
Saints in the mission the love of 
the Gospel, and has given them 
faith to keep the commandments, 
and to impart of their substance to 
help build up His kingdom on the 
earth. 

May the Lord bless the Latter- 
day Saints throughout Zion, both 
gathered and scattered. May He 
help us keep the commandments 
that we may reflect the light of the 
Gospel, that the honest in heart 
may be gathered together to sing 
His praises, build up His kingdom, 
and establish the reign of right- 
eousness in the earth, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

I sincerely desire, my brethren 
and sisters, your prayers of faith, 
that what I say to you shall be dic- 
tated by the Spirit of Truth, that 
it may be beneficial to you as well 
as to myself. I have rejoiced in the 
testimones of my brethren this af- 
ternoon. I have drank in from 
them inspiration in the mission 
work. I have rejoiced exceedingly 
in meeting with the Saints in this 
conference. It is grateful to ones' 
soul to come from the world where 
there is opposition, or if not oppo- 
sition, indifference that is more 
hurtful to us in our labors than op- 
position, to find such a vast con- 
course of people of one thought, one 
purpose and one mind, that are 
serving the Lord and keeping His 
commandments, who can truly say 
that we do know that God lives, 
that Jesus is the Christ, and that 
our souls shall live again. It has 
been, it seems to me, an epoch- 
making conference. The spirit that 
will go forth from it will be felt, 
doubtless, wherever the messengers 
of truth and salvation are sent, 
and it may be that even the spirit 
shall reach beyond the footsteps 
and go farther than the voices of 
our elders are heard ; for in my ex- 
perience I have learned that we 
never know the result of our ef- 
forts nor how far-reaching their 
effects. I was approached today 
upon the stand by a young man who 
heard us a few months ago in San 
Francisco, now come with gladness 
of heart to tell me that he had join- 
ed the Church. We lost sight of 
him just before the dreadful earth- 
quake that came upon us. I re- 
member once in traveling through 



the State of Nevada and stopping 
for a brief moment at one of the 
little side stations I was intercepted 
by a young man who came up to 
me and wanted to know if he had 
heard me speak upon the corner of 
Grant and Geary, in San Francisco, 
upon a certain date. I told him I 
was there about that time. He 
shook hands with me very warmly, 
and told me he wanted to come to 
Utah and to know more about that 
which he had heard that night on 
the street corner. When I arrived 
in the city, coming up the street 
here, I saw a gentleman looking at 
me rather peculiarly, and he ap- 
proached and asked if he had 
not heard me on the occasion be- 
fore mentioned. I told him, yes. 
He said that he was going east, and 
he had been constrained to stop off 
and visit the city, and if he could 
have found employment here it was 
his purpose to have remained. I 
will say that these two incidents 
were brought about by the one 
meeting, each of the young men 
having heard me speak just that 
once ; and I thought to myself, how 
far and how wide do our testimo- 
nies go and whence are they car- 
ried ? I have met men from various 
parts of the country who have said 
that when they heard our testimony, 
that "that is the same thing that I 
heard some elder say in the South," 
and another, "in New England," 
and another told me "in Australia;'' 
and one man said, "How is it that 
wherever you people are you alwavs 
bear the same testimony; you do 
not differ like us fellows of the 
world do. I am a Sunday School 
teacher, but another teacher differs 
with me in the interpretation of the 
Scriptures, but you fellows all 
speak the same way." He wanted 
to know if we were schooled and

trained in our academies or semi- 
naries of learning to that end. I re- 
ferred him to the words of Isaiah 
concerning the last days : "Thy 
watchmen shall lift up their voice, 
with the voice together shall they 
sing, for they shall see eye to eye 
when the Lord shall bring again 
Zion," and that He had brought 
again Zion. And the same testi- 
mony that Isaiah bore, along with 
the ancient prophets, and that was 
borne by the elders in these various 
places is borne by the Latter-day 
Saints in Zion. This was a testi- 
.mony to me that we are of the 
house of Israel, that we are that 
which we claim, the true worship- 
ers of the Lord Jesus Christ, seeing 
eye to eye, to His glory, under- 
standing alike the precepts of His 
Gospel. 

I rejoice very much, as my breth- 
ren have, in the Address that has 
been issued to the world. It is 
manful and able ; it carries convic- 
tion with it. The proof of each 
statement is in the matter set forth 
in itself. I thought what a splendid 
tract it would make for us in the 
missionary field, that here authori- 
tatively by the Presidency of the 
Church, endorsed by the body of 
the same, are these very principles 
brought together before the world. 
We elders have possibly been dis- 
credited, in part, because of our 
youth and inexperience, and people 
have said, "that may be the way 
you look at it," and ofttimes they 
do make such remarks, when we 
meet them. Sometimes they say : 
"Well, you are different from the 
rest of them; if they were all like 
you, they would be all right. If 
they would teach the same at home 
that they do in the world we could 
accept it." Now they have it au- 
thoritatively from the heads of the 



Church, endorsed by the people in 
conference assembled, 

I am glad to report, my brethren 
and sisters, that the condition of 
the California mission is much bet- 
ter than it was a year ago. This I 
hardly thought possible, following 
in the wake of the fire and the 
earthquake, that destroyed our 
home and the homes of many of 
the Saints in San Francisco, that 
shut us out of any hall, that pre- 
cluded all our street work, or any 
particular efforts in that city for 
some time. But despite it all, the 
Saints in that district paid a greater 
tithing last year than the year be- 
fore. The tithes of the mission are 
several hundred dollars more than 
they were the year previous, an ev- 
idence of increased faith and zeal. 
The work done by the elders ha-; 
also been very much greater, so far 
as statistics are concerned, than 
ever before. The number of homes 
visited by "invitation" has increased 
over 100 per cent. The number of 
homes visited in tracting, has in • 
creased about 60 per cent above the 
year before, and the number of 
tracts distributed about 35 per cent, 
and the number of books distrib- 
uted about 300 per cent, and bap- 
tims more than 100 per cent above 
the previous year. I have hardly 
ever spoken of statistical matters, 
because I thought it not particu- 
larly interesting, but the reports of 
my brethren made me feel to say 
this much for our mission in Cali- 
fornia. 

When it comes to speaking .of 
your sons, my brethren and sisters, 
I want to tell you that some of the 
choicest souls that are upon the 
earth have been laboring with me 
in that mission, and I know it be- 
cause God has loved them, He has 
magnified them in the eyes of the 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people. He has made the weak 
strong, and given wisdom to those 
who seemed like babes and suck- 
lings. Some of the mighty of that 
land have been confounded, and 
have been made to stand in awe, 
almost, at the wisdom of some of 
our boys. Some of the leaders of 
that state have complimented me 
upon the appearance which they 
make upon the streets. One physi- 
cian, who is a member of the State 
Board of Medical Examiners, tpld 
me : "Elder Robinson, whenever I 
see one of your boys on the street, 
I want to take him in my arms and 
bless him, because I can see clean- 
liness of life in his face and 
bearing. Before I knew you, before 
I knew of the mission of the Mor- 
mons in this state, I had this same 
desire and feeling in my heart, 
whenever I saw any of them." He 
has written me some letters calling 
me "Dear Brother," and saying 
"God will reward you and your 
boys for the work you are doing in 
uplifting humanity. You doubtless 
will sit with them at Tesus' feet, 
and I trust that I may be there, or 
be permitted to be where I may at 
least look on." The Chief Execu- 
tive, or Ex-Governor of our state 
has been a friend of our people. The 
Secretary of State, a long-stand- 
ing friend. Also the mayors of the 
largest cities. And of the two mil- 
lion and odd inhabitants of Cali- 
fornit, three-fifths of them are 
grouped within seventy miles of 
San Francisco and Los Angeles. 

We have done some work in Ari- 
zona. We went into the great min- 
ing camp of Bisbee, and found a 
little branch there almost disrupted, 
the presiding elder partly discour- 
aged. We assisted them a little 
while, and then went to Douglas, 
where the branch work had ceased 



entirely, and helped them. Brother 
Kimball,who presides in that Stake, 
followed our footsteps, and made a 
full ward organization at Bisbee 
and established a branch in Doug- 
lass. We felt that this was large- 
ly through the work of the elders 
in those two cities. We have had 
good success in Tucson, Arizona. 
We have finished recentl" our la- 
bors in the city of Phoenix, the cap- 
ital of the state ; and while there, 
this winter, had the privilege of 
meeting with some of the lawmak- 
ers of that territory, and with some 
of the leading commissioners of the 
counties, who met there to advise 
about ways and means for the im- 
provement of their various districts. 
So that in this wav we have come 
in touch with some of the leading 
spirits of these two states. In Ne- 
vada we have done but little. It is 
filling up rapidly with people, and 
when the mad rush for gold some- 
what relaxes, we hope to be able to 
do some good there. I wish to say 
that possibly the most joy that has 
come to us is the fact that we have 
been able to interest anew some of 
our brethren that have gone into 
those states or territories, that we 
have been able to reclaim some of 
the girls that have been led awav 
by the glamor of the world, by the 
thought of better employment, 
through the specious tales that de- 
signing men have told them. In this 
we have had a great deal of com- 
fort and consolation come to us, in 
the thought that we have been able 
to save some, or cause their return. 
Who are more precious to us than 
the sons and daughters of the 
Saints ? 

I want to refer just briefly to one 
of the thoughts put out in our Ad- 
dress to the World. It is a matter 
that I have brought before the lead- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



93 



ing men that I have come in contact 
with in the state of California, and 
that is respecting our -osition to- 
ward the general government of the 
land and the hope that we enter- 
tain in relation to it. 

I do not know that the Latter- 
day Saints themselves fully realize 
all that the Lord has in hand, or 
intends for the Gentiles, the peonle 
of these United States. In the Book 
of Mormon wondrous promises are 
made to them. The Lord speaks of 
this land as the chosen land of 
Joseph, where the tree of liberty 
should be planted, that all the na- 
tions of the earth should find pro- 
tection under its branches, that \a 
its beneficence it should reach out 
over the nations of the land with its 
succor and protection to all who 
should come to it ; that, for this pur 
pose, the Lord inspired the consti- 
tution, the men who framed it being 
raised up by Him, that His king- 
dom or His Church might be es- 
tablished here under the nrotecL n 
of the most benign and free "ov 
ernment of the world, and thus 
make its propoganda of the truth 
These are the words which the 
Lord sneaks in relation to it: 

"According to the laws and constitu- 
tion of the people which I have suffered 
to be established and should be main- 
tained for the rights and protection of 
all flesh, according to just and holy prin- 
ciples, that every man may act in doc- 
trine and principle pertaining to futur- 
ity, according to the moral agency 
which I have given unto them, that ev- 
ery man may be accountable for his own 
sins in the day of judgment. Therefore 
it is not right that any man should be in 
bondage one to another. [So that he 
could claim that he was not responsible 
for his acts, or that another might be 
held responsible for them.] And for 
this purpose have I established the con- 
stitution of this land, by the hands of 
wise men whom I raised up unto this 



very purpose, and redeemed the land by 
the shedding of blood." 

In the prayer which was offered, 
and which was given by revelation 
to the Prophet and Seer, Joseph 
Smith, and which was read in the 
Kirtland temple at the time of its 
dedication, March 27, 1836, these 
words occur : 

"Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the 
nations of the earth, have mercy upon 
the rulers of our land, may those prin- 
ciples which were so honorably and 
nobly defended, viz., the Constitution of 
our land, by our fathers, be established 
forever." 

How can they say that we seek to 
tear down our Constitution and 
laws in view of these words? 
Again : 

"Now these words, O Lord, we have 
spoken before thee, concerning the rev- 
elations and commandments which thou 
hast given unto us, who are identified 
with the Gentiles." 

"We," the Saints of God, then as- 
sembled in the temple, "who are 
identified with the Gentiles." Their 
interests, my brethren and sisters, 
are our interests ; our interests are 
their interests, as a commonwealth, 
and we cannot be separated from 
them. A kingdom cannot grow up 
within a kingdom established up- 
on democratic principles as this 
government has been. I might 
make a broader interpretation, 
probably, than is justifiable in read- 
ing to you from the great Prophet 
Daniel, but I read from the seventh 
chapter and 27th verse, speaking of 
the times when the Lord shall again 
establish His kingdom, the works 
which should follow in its wake, 
and how the little stone that was 
cut out of the mountains without 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



hands should roll forth and fill 
the whole earth, he says : "And the 
kingdom and the dominion and 
the greatness of the kingdom 
under the whole heaven shall 
be given to the people of the 
Saints of the Most High, whose 
kingdom is an everlasting king- 
dom, and all dominions shall serve 
and obey him." Now in our dec- 
laration, we state that God does 
nothing arbitrarily. Then He does 
all things naturally, and they follow 
as the natural sequence of condi- 
tions or events. He has predes- 
tined the events of the nation. He 
did intentionally set up kingdoms 
for various purposes, and He made 
Joseph a savior to his father's 
household and people in Egypt. If 
it had not been for the power of 
the kingdom in which his life and 
destiny were cast, he could not 
have done it. King Nebuchadnez- 
zar, whom God placed at the head 
of the nations of the earth, made it 
possible for Daniel to exercise the 
wondrous power which he did. 
Otherwise I believe that we would 
not have known of him as a prince 
of the House of Judah. Even 
Rome, which was set so bitterly 
against the Christian Church, as 
well as the Jew, enabled Paul to 
accomplish most successfully his 
mission in the earth. When the 
forty members of the Jewish 
scribes had said that they would 
neither eat nor drink until they had 
consummated the apostle's death, 
that power was taken away by the 
strong hand of Rome. And when 
Felix and Agrippa would have 
freed him, he had made the appeal 
to be tried according to the rights 
of a Roman, by the Roman law. By 
that means his life was saved, and 
he was taken to the household of 
Caesar, and had the privilege df de- 



claring for upwards of two years, 
if I remember aright, the Gospel 
in the very household of the em- 
peror, to the reclamation or con- 
version of many souls of Caesar's 
household. Conditions in this time 
and this day, thank the Lord, are 
different than in the cases to which 
I refer, for the Lord has not de- 
signed that His work should be 
thwarted or brought to naught in 
this dispensation, but I believe that 
this government and the people of 
this government will help us to 
maintain it. I believe God's king 
dom could not have been set up 
under other conditions or under any 
other government. How then is the 
law going forth from Zion and the 
word of the Lord from Jerusalem? 
You will remember that Christ is to 
come and reign as King of kings 
and Lord of lords. When He comes 
we will not all be Latter-day Saints ; 
but there will be Protestants, and 
there will be Catholics in the na- 
tions of the earth and in this land. 
Christ will reign over the kings of 
the earth, and they will acknowl- 
edge Him as the King of kings. 
They will pay tribute to Him, and 
kings and queens shall be the nurs- 
ing fathers and mothers of the 
Saints of the Most High, and the 
kingdom which will be set up will 
protect the Church, as I understand 
it, which will then be a protege of 
that kingdom and the Gospel shall 
be preached by the people of the 
Church, and the Great King will 
see that we have liberty in those 
states and countries which today 
shut their doors against us. Scarce- 
ly more than a decade ago, the Iron 
Chancellor, Bismarck, of Germany, 
speaking of the United States, said 
it was only a great "Commercial 
Ox," that it should not be taken into 
consideration in connection with 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 



95 



diplomatic affairs. What is the con- 
dition today? When John Hay, 
Secretary of State, voiced the gen- 
eral policy of this nation in regard 
to the Japanese war, declaring that 
Manchuria should not be divided, 
that the integrity of China should 
be maintained, the whole world 
stood aghast at his boldness. And 
Russia, even if she had won, would 
have lost under that policy, for then 
she held Manchuria in her own 
grasp ; but the policy that was sent 
out by the United States was main- 
tained and accepted by the peoples 
of the old world. Again, the ques- 
tion of the republics to the south of 
us, our position with relation to 
them has been fully defined by 
President Roosevelt, by Secretary 
Taft, also by Secretary Root, in 
convention at Rio Janerio, recently, 
as well as the policy that we pro- 
pose to follow in Oceanica. And 
the peoples of the world have ac- 
cepted the position of the govern- 
ment of the United States in refer- 
ence to these matters, and received 
our sentiment, and it has molded 
their legislation, while ten years apo 
they would not have listened to us, 
nor dare we have presumed to un- 
dertake to set forth what we would 
do in their territory or upon their 
continents. President Roosevelt 
has intimated to the powers of the 
earth what position the United 
States would take in regard to the 
government of the Congo Free 
State in Africa, and they have ac- 
cepted it. Are we beginning to 
mold the sentiment of the world? 

Are we preparing for the law to 
go forth from Zion, as well as send- 
ing the word of the Lord from Je- 
rusalem? Who are the people of 
the Saints of the Most High God? 
Are they the people of Germany? 



are they the people of England? are 
they the Scandinavian people? .are 
they the people in the republics to 
the south of us? are they the peo- 
ple of China, or India, or of Africa? 
You will say, doubtless, in your 
hearts, that they are the people of 
the United States, the Gentiles, with 
whose interests our interests are 
identified in the constitution and 
government which was prayed for, 
that it might forever stand. Then 
do I make too broad the application 
when I say that the government 
should be given to the people of the 
Saints of the Most High God ? It 
is something, at least, for us to 
think about, for we are but a hand- 
ful of people, and the prophecies 
made concerning us must certainly 
be fulfilled soon, if fulfilled within 
the time stated. We are scarcely 
400,000 people, and look at the four 
and a half millions of souls in New 
York City alone. We could scarcely 
police that city properly, let alone 
govern the eighty millions of this 
Republic. I tell you that our inter- 
ests are identified with the interests 
of the Gentiles, and when the^ come 
to understand our purpose and our 
mission, as this oroclamation will 
give them to know, they will not 
look upon us as a menace to the na- 
tion, nor as threatening the powers 
of government, but, quite the re- 
verse, they will be brought to the 
knowledge of the fact that we are 
the true worshipers of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that we would be the 
true conservators of peace on the 
earth and of good will toward men 
— rendering that which is just and 
true to all our fellows, by giving 
them a greater and better concep- 
tion of that which God has destined 
for this nation and people, and not 
only for those who are living, but 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for those also who have long since 
died. 

May the spirit of this conference, 
the spirit of truth, the spirit of lib- 
erty and of fairness, go abroad in 
the world. May the spirit of faith, 
of courage and integrity rest down 
upon our people, and find place in 
their hearts, that we shall not set 
our feet in forbidden paths, that our 
faces shall not be turned away from 
the light, but that we shall follow 
after the worthy example of our 
sires, and emulate the virtues of 
our mothers, until our Father shall 
say, "Enough, mv son, or my 
daughter, come home, for you have 
kept the faith, you. have finished 
your course, you have fought a 
good fight, and henceforth there is 
laid up for you a crown of right- 
eousness, and not for you only, but 
for all those that love the Lord 
Jesus Christ." Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn : 

O God, Thou God who rules on high, 
Bow down Thine ear to me : 

O listen to my humble cry, 
O hear my fervent plea. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

One of the quorum of the Twelve 
expressed himself the other dav. 
that it seemed to him a very short 
time indeed since our last general 
conference; and so it seems to me 
at this time. Since that conference 
in addition to visiting the Northern 
States mission, as referred to by 
President Ellsworth this afternoon, 
it was my privilege to accompanv 
Elder Hyrum M. Smith through 
the Central States mission, and I 
had an opportunity of noting the 
excellent conditions of missionary 
work in both of those missions. We 



had an opportunity to observe mis- 
sionary life in various stages of de j 
velopment. There was the young 
missionary, fresh from the field, or 
from the forge, with hardened, cal- 
oused hands, but with determina- 
tion written upon every feature of 
his face, that, with the help of the 
Lord, he would make a success of 
his missionary work. There was 
th^ sick elder, who was trying par- 
tially to conceal his illness, lest it 
might result in an untimely release, 
— the missionary who was willing" 
to take his chances on laying down 
his life in the missionary field rath- 
er than to return home before hav- 
ing fulfilled what is generally con- 
sidered to be a full missionary term. 
Then there was the older mission- 
ary, the family man, who had left 
his wife and little ones at home 
praying for his safety and anxious 
for his return only after he had 
filled an honorable mission ; the 
strong man weeping for joy at re- 
ceiving an honorable release, realiz- 
ing that he had fought a good fight 
as a soldier of the cross, had re- 
ceived an honorable release and was 
about to return home to his loved 
ones. The sight of fifty mission- 
aries coming in almost as it were by 
magic, at a set time, from all points 
of the compass, walking in, some 
. of them a distance of hundreds of 
miles, to attend the conference and, 
strange to note, not one of them 
appearing to be the worse for wear, 
neatly dressed, cheerful and joyous, 
not speaking of any hardships they 
had suffered, but rejoicing in the 
oooortunity of bringing souls unto 
Christ. And then I remembered 
that, formidable as the number ap- 
peared to be in a small village, the 
missionaries in the world number 
more than thirty-five times such a 
band as this, and that here at home 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

there are tens of thousands of el- 
ders who have performed similar 
unselfish service in behalf of man- 
kind, and there are thousands of 
others at home waiting to receive 
the call, and that those numbers are 
duplicated by faithful wives and 
mothers who are content to remain 
at home, some of them, perchance, 
enduring toil and privation, that 
their husbands, sons and brothers 
might perform this act of self-sac- 
rifice for the good of mankind. As 
keenlv as they might miss the com- 
pany of the husband or the brother, 
they would not have him return be- 
fore having fulfilled a faithful mis- 
sion. And all this in a commercial 
age, an age of greed and graft, 
when men generally are seeking - , 
exclusively almost, "the almighty 
dollar." Surely here is something 
new in the world — a system such as 
this, a people such as this, in an 
age when newspaper and magazine 
writers, and preachers, are com- 
menting unon the lack of faith that 
exists in the world, the falling off 
of church attendance, people ceas- 
ing to read the Bible, the spirit of 
skepticism, the spirit of graft and 
greed and unrest; when preachers 
concede that the middle class of 
people are losing interest in re- 
ligion, debating the question wheth- 
er it is a loss of faith in the church 
or whether it indicates something 
more deep-seajted than that, and 
means the loss of faith in God Him- 
self. Surely in an age such as this, 
when special programs of classical 
music have to be advertised in or- 
der to induce people to attend a 
short service of sermonizing, to 
have the interest that is now shown 
by the Latter-day Saints in meet- 
ing together, in proselyting — it is 
certainly in strange contrast to the 



conditions I have mentioned as ex- 
isting in the world. 

In visiting, recently, a number of 
the stakes and a large number of 
the wards. I have been fully con- 
vinced of the accuracy of the re- 
port that was made by President 
Smith at the opening of this con- 
ference. There is a lively interest 
taken by the people in religious 
matters, in meeting together and in 
observing the laws and ordinances 
of the Church. In one town the 
Bishop was able to report that not 
one young person in that town was 
a breaker of the Word of Wisdom, 
boy or girl ; and that the men who 
broke the Word of Wisdom, or at 
least, who used tobacco or liquor, 
could be counted upon the fingers 
of one hand, and then there would 
be fingers to spare. In a number 
of settlements every person could 
be accounted for, those who were 
not sick or absent from town were 
at the meetings. 

An elder renorted to me during 
this conference that he had almost 
secured a choice convert to the 
Church, a learned man, educated 
for the ministry, a practicing law- 
yer, a man who took an interest in 
religious affairs; that he had been 
converted in reference to the princi- 
ples of the Gospel, and that the only 
thing lacking was that he was not 
yet convinced that an angel of the 
Lord appeared to Joseph, the 
Prophet ; that he was not convinced 
of the angelic visitations or the 
revelations upon which the Church 
is founded. Certainly a very im- 
portant element was still lacking 
for his complete conversion, for 
Mormonism with angelic visitations 
and revelations omitted would be 
in the religious world what in the 
drama of Hamlet that play would 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be with the character of Hamlet 
omitted. 

An elder told me a short time ago 
of a visit that he made to Kirtland, 
in the late seventies. A venerable 
guide showed him through that 
temple, the different apartments, 
the pulpits, etc., and during the time 
he was complaining somewhat con- 
cerning Brigham Young, who was 
then president of the Church. The 
guide was no less a person than 
Martin Harris, and the elder said 
to him, "How is it, Mr. Harris, that 
you now complain of the Church? 
How about that visitation of an an- 
gel that you claim to have had ? At 
that the old gentleman straightened 
up, new life seemed to come into 
him, and he said, "Just as sure as 
there is- a God in heaven, just as 
sure as that sun is shining in the 
firmament, just as sure as the moon 
and stars give their light by night, 
just so sure I know that Joseph 
Smith was a Proohet of God, just 
so sure I know that I saw the plates 
from which the Book of Mormon 
was translated, and that I handled 
them with my own hands, and saw 
the angel and heard his voice." And 
he said, "So long as I live I shall 
bear the same testimony, and when 
I die I shall die bearing the same 
testimony." And, strangely enough 
it so happened, that after Martin 
Harris came to Zion and re-joined 
the Church, and received his bless- 
ings in the terrmle, at his death-bed 
the same elder was present, and the 
last audible words of Martin Har- 
ris that could be distinguished were 
words of testimony, supporting the 
statements that he had always made 
as to the divine authenticity of the 
Book of Mormon. 

I have sometimes wished that I 
might have had from some of these 
witnesses a less formal statement 



than the beautiful one which is 
printed on the fly leaf of the Book 
of Mormon, signed by the three 
witnesses, and which carries with it 
the spirit of inspiration under which 
it was given ; that we might have 
something more in detail, more par- 
ticulars from some of those breth- 
ren. I chanced to find recently, a 
statement from Oliver Cowdery, in 
a letter to W. W. Phelps, and with 
your forebearance, I will read that 
statement, as it seems to me to have 
the true ring, and should have an 
effect in convincing individuals who 
have not already been converted, 
that the man who wrote these 
words was a sincere man, and that 
every word he uttered is the truth. 
In this letter dated September 7. 
1834, after telling about the desire 
for a manifestation from the Lord 
and how he and Joseph, apart from 
the abodes of men, had fervently 
asked the Lord for this conde- 
scension, he goes on to say : 

"On a sudden, as from the midst of 
eternity, the voice of the Redeemer 
spake peace to us, while the veil was 
parted and the angel of God came down 
clothed with glory, and delivered the 
anxiously-looked-for message and the 
keys of the Gospel of repentance. What 
joy! what wonder! what amazement! 
While the world was racked and dis- 
tracted — while millions were groping as 
the blind for the wall, and while all men 
were resting upon uncertainty, as a gen- 
eral mass, our eyes beheld — our ears 
heard, as the "blaze of day," yes more — 
above the glitter of the May sunbeam, 
which then shed its brilliancy over the 
face of nature ! Then his voice, though 
mild, pierced to the center, and his 
words, 'I am thy fellow servant' dis- 
pelled every fear. We listened, we gazed, 
we admired. 'Twas the voice of the an- 
gel from glory — 'twas a message from 
the Most High, and as we heard we re- 
joiced, while his love enkindled upon 
our souls, and we were rapt in the 
vision of the Almighty. Where was 
room for doubt? Nowhere; uncertainty

had fled, doubt had sunk no more to 
rise, while fiction and deception had fled 
forever. 

"But, dear brother, think further, 
think for a moment what joy filled our 
hearts and with what surprise we must 
have bowed (for who would not 
have bowed the knee for such a bless- 
ing?) when we received under his hands 
the Holy Priesthood, as he said : 'Upon 
you, my fellow servants, in the name of 
Messiah, I confer this priesthood and 
this authority, which shall remain upon 
the earth, that the sons of Levi may yet 
offer an offering unto the Lord in 
righteousness.' I shall not attempt to 
paint to you the feelings of this heart, 
nor the majestic beauty and glory which 
surrounded us on this occasion; but you 
will believe me when I say, that earth, 
nor men, with the eloquence of time, 
cannot begin to clothe language in as in- 
teresting and sublime a manner as this 
holy personage. No ; nor has this earth 
power to give the 'joy, to bestow the 
peace, or comprehend the wisdom which 
was contained in each sentence as it 
was delivered by the power of the Holy 
Spirit. Man may deceive his fellow 
man ; deception may follow deception, 
and the children of the wicked one may 
have power to seduce the foolish and 
untaught, till naught but fiction feeds the 
many, and the fruit of falsehood carries 
in its current the giddy to the grave, 
but one touch with the finger of his 
love, yes, one ray of glory from the 
upper world, or one word from the 
mouth of the Savior from the bosom of 
eternity, strikes it all into insignificance, 
and blots it forever from the mind. The 
assurance that we were in the presence 
of an angel; the certainty that we heard 
the voice of Jesus, and the truth un- 
sullied as it flowed from a pure person- 
age, dictated by the will of God, is to 
me past description, and I shall ever 
look upon this expression of the Savior's 
goodness with wonder and thanksgiving 
while I am permitted to tarry, and in 
those mansions where perfection dwells 
and sin never comes, I hope to adore, in 
that day which shall never cease." 

How strange, after a man had 
been given such a glorious visita- 
tion and testimony as this, that he 
should afterwards grow lukewarm 
in his adherence to the principles of 



the Gospel. But at the same time 
these witnesses never faltered in 
their adherence to the first testi- 
mony that they gave. There may 
have been a design in this circum- 
stance of their departing from the 
faith, all three of these great wit- 
nesses, in order to strengthen the 
testimonies that they gave; for do 
not their testimonies stand stronger 
and more convincing today, from 
the fact that they parted from the 
faith but never departed one iota 
from the testimony that they gave 
as to the divine restoration of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ in this dis- 
pensation ? 

I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord may be with you, and that we 
may be able "to pray always, .keen- 
ing our lamps trimmed and burn- 
ing and oil with us, that we may 
be ready for the coming of the 
Bridegroom." I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

I have a few reflections in regard 
to what has been said here today 
and a few historical dates and facts 
which I would like to give in con- 
nection with the missionary reports 
that we have listened to on this oc- 
casion. Nearly all those who have 
been appointed to address you this 
afternoon in this hall may be said 
to represent the missionary depart- 
ment of the Church, and it is very 
interesting to note the missionary 
work that has been accomplished 
by the Elders of the Church so 
far ; and yet the great missionary 
work that lies in the future to be 
accomplished is of incalculable 
dimensions. 

Christ commanded His Disciples, 
just before ascending into heaven, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that they were to go forth and 
preach the Gospel to ev- 
ery creature. We find it 
also recorded that the dis- 
ciples on a certain occasion ap- 
proached Jesus, as he sat upon the 
Mount of Olives, and asked Him 
about His second coming and the 
end of the world. In his answer 
to them he said. "This Gospel of 
the kingdom shall be preached in 
all the world as a witness to all 
people, and then shall the end 
come." 

This Gospel as referred to by the 
Savior on that ocassion,is certainly 
not to be preached in a great many 
different ways; but it is to be 
preached in power; it is to be 
preached by authority; it is to be 
preached by the servants of God 
who have been properly commis- 
sioned to go forth for that purpose ; 
it is to be preached as a witness, 
and for that reason, John, the Rev- 
elator, while on the Isle of Patmos, 
saw that an angel should fly 
through the midst of heaven, hav- 
ing the everlasting gospel to preach 
unto those who dwell upon the 
earth. The Latter-day Saints bear 
testimony ,that that angel has come 
and that the true Gospel of Jesus 
Christ was restored through him ; 
but they also believe that the work, 
the main work of communicating 
it to mankind, has been committed 
to mortals who are ordained in the 
flesh to go forth into all the world 
and proclaim the Gospel. 

I find that this Church, commenc- 
ing with the time when it was first 
organized, has ever been true to its 
calling, to bear witness to the 
world ; since its first organization 
it has been diligent in sending forth 
its Elders to perform this great 
work. 

I find that before the close of the 
year in which the Church was or- 



ganized, namely 1830, the restored 
Gospel had been preached to a con- 
siderable extent in the States of 
New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio 
(the eastern part of Ohio), in the 
latter State by Oliver Cowdery and 
four other Elders who had been 
sent out on a special mission to the 
Lamanites. 

The next year, 1 831, the Elders of 
the Church extended their mission- 
ary labors westward as far as Illi- 
nois and Missouri, and preached 
also in Indiana and Michigan, and 
going eastward they went as far 
as Vermont, where the first branch 
of the Church in New England was 
raised up by Jared Carter in the 
latter part of 1831. 

In 1832, the Elders reached, in 
their ministry, the state of Vir- 
ginia, and preached in that part of 
said State which is now included 
in the state of West Virginia; they 
also crossed the Ohio river at Cin- 
cinnati into Kentucky. Other 
Elders, among them Orson Hyde 
and Orson Pratt, the same year in- 
troduced the Gospel in New Hamp- 
shire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island and Maine. 

In 1833, the labors of the Elders 
were extended into New Jersey and 
in 1834 into Tennessee and Ark- 
ansas. During the few following 
years, the Gospel was introduced 
into nearly all the Southren States. 

Then came the martydrom of the 
Prophets and the exodus of the 
Saints from Nauvoo, and it seems 
as though nothing has ever hap- 
pened in the history of this Church 
to verify the saying of the Savior 
in regard to the mustard seeds, so 
perfectly as that same exodus. Hit 
the head of a mustard, plant, 
when ripe, and it will scatter the 
seed abroad, so that it will cover a 
great area. The departure of the 
Saints into the western wilderness 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



101 



became the immediate means of in- 
troducing the restored Gospel into 
the western half of the United 
States. The circumstances con- 
nected with the driving out of the 
Saints from Nauvoo, at this par- 
ticular time led, among other 
things to the sailing of about two 
hundred Saints from New York on 
the ship "Brooklyn," in the month 
of February, 1846. This ship 
doubled Cape Horn and introduced 
the Latter-day Saints with their 
Elders to the people of California, 
where they commenced immediate- 
ly to preach the Gospel on the 31st 
day of July, 1846, when they 
landed ; and until the present time 
California has never been without a 
Latter-day Saint. 

I find also that as the Saints were 
driven westward, and as their 
camps moved across Iowa, and 
through that part of the country 
which is now Nebraska and 
W yoming ,the influence of Mormon 
Elders and Saints generally were 
felt in those parts. I find further- 
more, that the Mormon Battalion, 
in being called to perform their 
grand march westward in the ser- 
vice of their country, in the latter 
part of 1846, traversed over what 
is now the state of Kansas in almost 
its entire length. "Mormon" Elders 
prayed, preached and sang the 
songs of Zion around their camp- 
fires as they traveled along toward 
the setting sun. Also a part of what 
is now Oklahoma was travers- 
ed by these same Latter-day Saint 
soldiers in their, journeyings, as 
were also New Mexico and Ari- 
zona. And when the Mormon Bat- 
talion arrived in southern Cali- 
fornia, in the early part of 1847, 
there was another introduction of 
"Mormonism" into that state from 
the east. 

Tn the year 1847, also, the exiled 



Saints pushed their way through to 
these western valleys of the moun- 
tains and founded their first set- 
tlement in what three years later 
became by congressional act 
the Territory of Utah. A 
fraction of the Mormon Battal- 
ion, as they journeyed from Cali- 
fornia eastward to join their 
families and friends in the valley 
of the Great Salt Lake, passed 
through portions of what is now 
Nevada and Idaho in the fall of 
1847. 

Retracing my steps a little I may- 
add that as early as 1837 the Gos- 
pel, as restored by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, was preached by the 
Elders of the Church in Wiscon- 
sin and Maryland; as early as 1838 
in North Carolina and as early as 
1839 in South Carolina and Miss- 
issippi. Before 1843 the Elders, 
in their travels, had reached Ala- 
bama, Florida, Delaware, Georgia 
and Louisiana. A branch existed in 
New Orleans as early as 1848. Ore- 
gon first became a missionary field 
for our Elders in 1856. 

I will now, for a few moments, 
direct your attenttion to our mis- 
sionary labors in foreign lands. In 
1832, when the Church was only 
about two years old, the restored 
Gospel reached Canada through the 
instrumentality of Joseph Young, 
Brigham Young and others. Joseph 
the Prophet, Sidney Rigdon and 
others preached in Upper Canada 
in 1833 and Parley P. Pratt opened 
up a great mission in and about the 
city of Toronto in 1836. From 
Canada the Gospel spread to Eng- 
land. Elder Heber C. Kimball and 
others were sent to that country 
in 1837 and laid the foundation of 
that great and fruitful mission. 
Scotland was first visited by our 
Elders in 1839, Ireland in 1840 and 
Wales in 1 841. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



But so far the Gospel had been 
preached only to English-speaking 
people. In 1843 the fi rst Elders 
were called to the Pacific Islands. 
This mission was in a certain sense 
really the first foreign mission of 
the Church that is as far as foreign 
languages are concerned. Four 
Seventies were called that year 
from Nauvoo to go to the islands 
of the Pacific. One of these 
(Brother Knowlton F. Hanks) 
found a watery grave before reach- 
ing his destination. He was the 
first of our missionaries who was 
buried at sea. The other three 
Elders arrived at the Society Is- 
lands in safety, and about the time 
Joseph and Hyrum Smith were 
martyred in Carthage jail the first 
branch of the Church was or- 
ganized by Addison Pratt on the 
island of Tubuai among a people 
who did not speak the English 
language. One of these first mis- 
sionaries to the Pacific Islands, 
Elder Noah Rogers, was the first 
of our Elders to circumnavigate the 
globe. In that first mission in the 
Pacific Ocean still known as the 
Society Islands Mission there are 
today about I'Soo members of the 
Church. 

In 1849 the restored Gospel was 
first introduced into France by the 
late William Howell and the fol- 
lowing year by Apostle John Tay- 
lor and fellow-missionaries who or- 
ganized a branch of the Church in 
Paris. 

In the fall of 1849 a number of 
missionaries were called from this 
valley — the first Elders called to 
foreign fields from Great Salt Lake 
Valley. Nearly all of these were 
called to open up new missionary- 
fields among non-English speaking 
peoples and while it took some oi" 
these Elders many months to reach 
the different countries in which 



they had been assigned to labor, the 
next year, 1850, found them all en- 
tering upon their missionary work 
with more or less success. Thus, 
in 1850, a very successful mission 
was opened up in Denmark 
through the instrumentality of 
Apostle Erastus Snow and others. 
The first converts were also made 
in Sweden that year by Elder John 
E. Forsgren. Another mission was 
opened in Italy by Apostle Lorenzo 
Snow and missionary companions, 
and another one in Hawaii by 
Hiram Clark, George Q. Cannon 
and eight other Elders. 

In 185 1 the Gospel door was 
opened to the inhabitants of Swit- 
zerland, Norway, Australia and 
Chili, while William Willis brought 
the glad tidings to India and mis- 
sionaries from Denmark first 
visited Iceland in the far off north. 

In 1852 the Elders penetrated 
further into their missionary fields, 
but did not open up any new ones 
of very great importance that year. 

I forgot to state that as 
early as 1841 the first Latter- 
day Saint missionary visited the 
Holy. Land Apostle Orson 
Hyde was the man who went 
there, and on the top of the Mount 
of Olives he dedicated that histori- 
cal land for the gathering of Israel 
in the last days. Subsequently 
Palestine became a regular mission- 
ry field as a part of the Turkish 
mission. 

In 1853 our elders first preached 
the gospel on the island of Malta,in 
the Mediterranean which once was 
a missionary field of the Apostle 
Paul. Two elders also went to 
Gibraltar and commenced to preach 
the Gospel in Spain. Their work, 
however, was almost confined to 
the garrison under the English flag 
for when the elders attempted to 
cross the isthmus into Spanish Ter- 
ritory proper they were forbidden 



ELDER ANDREW IENSON. 



103 



to do so by the civil authorities. 

In 1853, a l so > th e elders entered 
the West Indies as missionaries, but 
met with little success. They also 
went to Prussia that year, but the 
elders going there were promptly 
banished from Berlin, and not till 
years later were missionary labors 
successfully commenced in the 
German-speaking part of the world. 
China was also tried as a mission- 
ary field in 1853. Brother Hosea 
Stout, an old stalwart Nauvoo 
"Mormon," went there, together 
with others, but they soon got dis- 
couraged and returned home. The 
Chinese, however, have become 
more enlightened since that time, 
and we have reason to expect that 
a successful missionary field will 
be opened in that land in the near 
future. 

In 1854 the Gospel was first 
preached in New Zealand, but 
scarcely any attention was paid to 
the Maoris until 1883. In 1884, 
missionary work was first com- 
menced in Turkey in Europe. In 
1888 the Samoan mission was 
opened, and in 1894 our elders be- 
gan missionary labors in Tonga, 
another group of islands in the 
Pacific Ocean. In 1900 the Her- 
vey group or Cook Islands and also 
the Marquesas group were made 
missionary fields by our elders. In 
1901 Japan was entered by Elders 
Heber J. Grant and others. 

In summing up, I may state that 
so far we have preached the Gos- 
pel quite successfully in all the 
states of the Union, also in Canada, 
on the north, and in Mexico, on the 
south ; but I might say that North 
America is the only grand division 
of the globe that we have fully 
covered by our missionary opera- 
tions. 

In Central America we have done 
next to nothing. In 1902 some of 



our Elders established themselves 
temporarily in Gautemala ; but we 
have not preached in San Salvador, 
in Honduras, in Nicaragua, in 
Costa Rica, or in British Honduras. 

In South America, we have done 
some preaching in Chili and Peru, 
but we have not done any mission- 
ary work in Columbia, Venezuela, 
British Guiana, Dutch Guiana, 
French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, 
Paraguay , Uruguay, Argentina and 
Equador. All these countries in 
South America will yet be made 
missionary fields by our Elders. 

In Europe, we have done exten- 
sive missionary work. We have 
large a.ad numerous branches in 
Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, 
Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, 
Netherlands, and Belgium; but we 
have only a few Saints in Austria- 
Hungary, Italy, Greece, Turkey in 
Europe, Russia, Romania, Servia 
and Bulgaria. We have not 
preached at all in Spain and Portu- 
gal. 

In Asia, we have done limited 
work in Turkey (in Asia) includ- 
ing Palestine and Asia Minor, and 
also in parts of India, and we have 
visited China and Siam ; but we 
have done nothing in Asiatic Rus- 
sia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Per- 
sia, Thibet, Arabia and Korea. 

In Africa we have only estab- 
lished a mission in the Cape Colony 
but there are other states there in 
which we have not yet preached 
the Gospel. Some of our Elders 
have visited Egypt, but have done 
but very little preaching there. As 
stated the only place where we so 
far have preached in Africa is the 
Cape Colony, in South Africa. Our 
Elders went to Cape Town in T853 
and continued their labors in that 
colony for 11 years. Nearly all 
the saints then emigrated, and it 
is only of late years that the Gos- 



101 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pel door has been again opened to 
the people in that part of the world. 

We have preached the Gospel in 
all the Australian colonies, includ- 
ing New South Wales, Victoria, 
Queensland, South Australia, West 
Australia and Tasmania, and also 
on both islands of New Zealand. 

In Oceanica, or the smaller 
islands in the Pacific Ocean, we 
have preached the Gospel in the 
following groups : Society Islands, 
Tuamotu Islands, Hawaii, Samoa, 
and Tonga, and to a limited ex- 
tent, also, in the Marquesas, and 
on the Cook Islands, (Harvey 
group) . 

My brethren and sisters, we ex- 
pect to preach the Gospel in all 
the world; and by way of con- 
clusion I will say: May God 
speed the day that religious liberty 
may be given to all the inhabitants 
of the earth ; may the time soon 
come that all may enjoy the fruits 
of the Gospel as freely as they now 
enjoy the sunshine of the Al- 
mighty ; and may that love of lib- 
erty which has been kindled in the 
hearts of the people in our own 
land spread throughout the entire 
world, until our elders can go forth 
in peace and safety and preach the 
Gospel to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people. This is my 
sincere prayer in the name of Jesua 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Jesus, 
lover of my soul." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder William Spry. 



Outdoor Meeting. 

The great Tabernacle and com- 
modious Assembly Hall were 
crowded beyond their capacity, and 



an outdoor meeting was conducted, 
from the steps of the Bureau of In- 
formation building, in behalf of the 
multitude outside. 

Elder George Albert Smith pre- 
sided, and Prof. Charles Kent led 
the singing. 

The congregation united in sing- 
ing the hymn, "We thank Thee, O 
God, for a Prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Frank Sheffield. 

The congregation sang the hymn : 
"O my Father, Thou that dwellest." 

ELDER WM. T. JACK. 

Elder George Albert Smith intro- 
duced William T. Jack of the Cas- 
sia, Idaho, stake. Elder Jack was 
much pleased with the conference 
and the excellent spirit which pre- 
vailed. From the crowds of peo- 
ple thronging the space, unable to 
gain admittance to the meetings in 
the buildings, it is evident that Zion 
is growing. He rejoiced in the 
possession of a testimony of the 
truth of the Gospel which he had 
received through the Holy Spirit. 
This is the privilege of all who 
have embraced the Gospel, and car- 
ried out the teachings of the same. 
The speaker testified of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and said his work was the 
beginning of a marvelous work in 
the latter days. There is no fear 
regarding this work, nor for those 
who abide by the principles of the 
Gospel, for it will lead them to eter- 
nal life. 

ELDER F. S. BRAMWELL. 

President F. S. Bramwell of the 
Union, Oregon, stake, was the next 
speaker. "I am reminded very for- 
cibly, on this occasion of the vision 
seen by the ancient prophets, when 



OUTDOOR MEETING. 



105 



they said that in the last days the 
house of the Lord should be built 
in the tops of the mountains and 
that all nations should flow unto it." 
The fulfillment of that prophecy is 
here and now, for Israel has gath- 
ered here from all nations. When- 
ever the people of the world be- 
come converted to the Gospel the 
spirit of gathering: comes upon them 
at once, and in following; the 
promptings of this spirit they come 
to Zion. When we look to the 
Temple on our right, we behold one 
of the works of Mormonism ; when 
we gather to praise the Lord we 
have the witness of the Spirit, and 
we sing and praise God with the 
knowledge in our souls that the 
Gospel is true and that God lives." 

ELDEE GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Elder G. F. Richards said he had 
cause to be exceeding joyful in the 
manifestations of the goodness of 
God to him, and for the testimony 
of the truth of the work which he 
possessed. "I rejoice in my testi- 
mony of the truth of the mission of 
Joseph Smith, and it is the priv- 
ilege of every man to obtain the 
same testimony. The Lord ap- 
proves those who acknowledge their 
testimony under any and all obsta- 
cles, and show by their lives that 
they acknowledge God, for we are 
in His image and have attributes 
that may assist us to attain perfec- 
tion." 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Now let us rejoice in the day of 
salvation." 

ELDER NEPHI U. S. C. JENSEN. 

Elder Jensen also expressed him- 
self as much pleased with the soirit 
of the outdoor gathering, and with 
the practical workings of Mormon- 



ism. There is nothing that attracts 
the people so much as the preaching 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Ev- 
ery Latter-day Saint can give an 
answer to the question, "Do you 
know that Jesus Christ lives ?" They 
do not hesitate ; they do not stop 
to explain ; with all the fervor in 
them they answer, "Yes, I know 
that Christ lives, and that He is the 
Redeemer of the world." Let us be 
charitable and forgiving. The 
genius of the Gospel of Christ was 
expressed in Christ's words to the 
Magdalene, when her accusers had 
fled, "Go thy way and sin no more." 
It is not that you have sinned ; but 
it is that you sin no more, that will 
save your soul. 

ELDER RTJLON S. WELLS. 

Elder Rulon S. Wells said in 
part : "To me there is ample evi- 
dence that this is the work of the 
Lord. The impress of divinity is 
upon it. Surely the Lord has 
wrought a marvelous work and a 
wonder since He revealed to the boy 
prophet the fulness of the everlast- 
ing Gospel. The angel seen by John 
on the Isle of Patmos has flown 
through the midst of heaven with 
the everlasting Gospel, and all who 
will may obey it and receive a sal- 
vation. The great obstacle in the 
way of the world is that they will 
not turn away from their evil ways. 
If they would do so and repent, 
they would become susceptible to 
the truth. The speaker bore a strong 
testimony to the truth of the Gos- 
pel. 

ELDER GEORGE S. YOUNG. 

Elder George S. Young, of the 
presidency of the Teton stake, made 
a brief address in which he ex- 
pressed his pleasure in meeting with 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Saints here, and added his tes- 
timony regarding the truth of the 
Gospel. 

ELDER JAMES G. DTJFFIN. 

Elder James G. Duffin said that 
during the seven years of his incum- 
bency of the presidency of the Cen- 
tral States mission, in receiving and 
releasing more than 600 mission- 
aries, he had not had occasion to 
release a single elder for misconduct 
or sin. The manv attempts to defile 
Zion had proven fruitless, and the 
good old doctrines taught the young 
men and young women by their 
mothers at home had saved them in 
their hour of trial, and he thanked 
God for such young men and wom- 
en, such mothers and such a Gos- 
pel. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

closed with a few appropriate re- 
marks, commending the patience of 
the large crowd, and bearing testi- 
mony to the truth of what had been 
said. 

The congregation sang, "The 
Spirit of God like a fire is burning," 
and benediction was offered by El- 
der Henry D. Wallace. 



Closing Session. 

In the Tabernacle, at 2 p. m. 

President Joseph F. Smith called 
the meeting to order, and an- 
nounced that an outdoor meeting 
would be held under direction of El- 
der George Albert Smith, also an- 
other overflow meeting in the As- 
sembly Hall. 

The choir sang the hymn: 



An angel from on high 
The long, long silence broke ; 

Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words he spoke r 

"Lo! in Cumorah's lonely hill 
A sacred record lies concealed." 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
Lewis W. Shurtliff. 

The choir sang the anthem,. 
"Grant Us Peace, O Lord." 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Be not "lovers of pleasure more than- 
lovers of God." — A reasonable 
degree of recreation and amusement 
unobjectionable.— Excess is dangerous 
to morals.— Responsibility of parents 
in controlling pleasure-seeking chil- 
dren. 

I think, if my memory serves me 
correctly, it was St. Paul, in one of 
his epistles to Timothy, who said 
that in the last days men shall be 
"lovers of pleasure more than lovers 
of God." It occurs to me that the 
truth of this is now being realized, 
and that the tendency to become 
lovers of pleasure more than lovers 
of God is growing in many parts of 
the world ; nor are we ourselves as- 
free from this disposition as we 
should be. President Lund this 
morning, in dwelling upon rever- 
ence and respect for the Sabbath 
day, recognized by the Christian 
peoples of the world as the day ap- 
pointed for rest and worship, point- 
ed out to us the necessity of remem- 
bering the suggestions contained in 
the revelations of our Heavenly 
Father to us in our own time. I 
believe we are more censurable in 
regard to this tendency of pleasure- 
seeking than perhaps in any other 
respect, without it may be our con- 
tinued disregard of the Word of 
Wisdom, concerning which the 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 



107 



brethren have been speaking. The 
spirit of the times leads us in the 
way of amusement. I am not one of 
those that have serious objections 
to amusement ; on the contrary, I 
am in sympathy with a reasonable 
amount of recreation and pleasure. 
But when we note the fact that the 
weekdays are devoted largely to 
pleasure, and the Sabbath day is 
also taken for that purpose, we can- 
not help but feel that there is an 
overstepping of legitimate bounds 
in this direction. From the be- 
ginning of this work, the Latter- 
day Saints have been accorded the 
privilege by our Heavenly Father, 
through His servants, of enjoying 
themselves in a reasonable way in 
the dance, in representations upon 
the mimic stage, and in social gath- 
erings in keeping with legitimate 
exercise, to lighten the heart and 
give the mind release from the tur- 
moils and struggles that corne to 
every man and woman who per- 
form their part and discharge the 
responsibilities of life. But when we 
find our young people engaged in a 
variety of amusements nearly ev- 
ery evening in the week,with scarce- 
ly an evening spent at home, and 
indulging in companionships that 
are not in keeping with the right, 
going to places of amusement where 
men and women of all classes are 
permitted to congregate, and min- 
gling with influences that tend to 
demoralization, it would seem to be 
time to call a halt. I believe that 
a more thoughtful and prudent 
course of conduct should be pur- 
sued by us in connection with these 
matters, and that these general 
gathering places, wherein our sons 
and daughters are permitted to con- 
gregate, should be modified in their 
effects. Where places are open 
continuouslv for those classes of 



amusement that bring the immoral 
and impure into contact with the 
innocent and the pure, and the door 
is opened for the introduction of 
immorality and crime into every 
village, town and city throughout 
the land, the Latter-day Saints 
should be much more thoroughly 
upon their guard in regard to this 
than they have been perchance. As 
I remarked before, I am a believer 
in legitimate and proper amuse- 
ments. The boys and girls, the 
fathers and mothers, should mingle 
together and have proper recreation 
and pleasure, but free from the pos- 
sibility of vicious and impure as- 
sociation. The children entrusted 
to our watchcare should not be 
turned loose thoughtlessly, with- 
out guardians or chaperones, into 
the companionship of men who 
scheme and devise for the injury 
and overthrow of their kind, who 
boast of their conquests, and who 
rejoice in the opportunities offered 
them to lead from the path of rec- 
titude any young or thoughtless girl 
that may be brought into their 
company. The same is true in re- 
gard to the other sex, where there 
are abandoned and impure women, 
whose companionship is a menace 
to thoughtless and imprudent boys. 
Thrown into that species of com- 
pany, they are apt to be led from 
the path of rectitude and the mark 
of shame written upon their brows 
by some overt act of an impure 
character. 

I trust that the suggestion of St. 
Paul may be held in remembrance 
by the Latter-day Saints, as well as 
by all other Christian people who 
reside in the communities where 
we have companionship, that in the 
enjoyment of the pleasures which 
come from legitimate association 
we shall si jw reverence and regard 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for onr Father in heaven, that 
blight shall not come upon us by the 
spread of that spirit of thoughtless- 
ness and recklessness and extreme 
desire for pleasure which shall 
carry from the home circle every 
evening and during much of the 
day, as well as upon the Sabbath 
day, members of so many house- 
holds among us. I ask my broth- 
ers and sisters to look at this mat- 
ter thoughtfully and prudently, and 
that as a community, standing at 
the head of homes, having the sal- 
vation of the community at heart, 
we shall seek to make this impress 
upon our own children ; and that 
we may not find ourselves, because 
of the liberality of our neighbors in 
connection with these things, un- 
able to throw around our own the 
proper restraints necessary to keep 
them in that purity of life and that 
consistent course of conduct which 
we so much desire ; that respect and 
regard for the Supreme Being may 
be maintained, and that they may 
not drift with the current, lose their 
power of control, and become un- 
thankful, inconsiderate, and in ev- 
ery way improvident, so far as rev- 
erence for our Father in heaven is 
concerned. I believe that when the 
great judge of the quick and the 
dead shall look into the lives of His 
children and consider the problems 
involved in the well-being of his 
sons and daughters, we will find 
ourselves under most serious con- 
demnation for the extent to which 
we 'are permitting these children of 
ours to go unchecked. I recognize 
the experiences through which you 
go, from my own experiences along 
the same line. It is impossible to 
put a wise head upon young shoul- 
ders, and to impress upon the mind 
of a boy or a girl that their com- 
panionship should be guarded most 



carefully. They say to you, Why, 
this brother or that sister allow 
their boys and girls to go hither and 
yonder; they have no objection to 
their being found in restaurants, en- 
joying the companionship of unde- 
sirable persons ; they do not object 
to their sons and daughters fre- 
quenting the skatinp- rinks, or in the 
great resorts that grow up in our 
communities ; why should you ob- 
ject to our going when all around 
us have these privileges? I pre- 
sume such remarks are brought to 
the home of every father and moth - 
er. But I am satisfied that our re- 
grets will be much greater in the 
future than they have been in the 
past unless we shall bear in mind 
the sacredness of the obligation of 
fatherhood and motherhood in this 
connection. Let them sing the 
songs of Zion ; let them enjoy them- 
selves legitimately in the dance; let 
them have their privilege of visit- 
ing these pleasure resorts under 
conditions that shall restrain them 
from the possibility of being thrown 
into the companionship of vile men 
and women who would lead them 
from the path of rectitude and im- 
plant in their hearts the seeds of 
their overthrow and destruction. T 
ask you to weigh this problem, that 
our children mav not stand with 
those who shall be lovers of pleas- 
ure more than lovers of God, but 
that in the enjoyment of the proper 
pleasures of life, guarded by the 
companionship of the wise and pru- 
dent, they shall receive their lawful 
opportunities, rightly honoring the 
Supreme Being and the moral rules 
given of Him, sustaining the prin- 
ciples of righteousness, and bring- 
ing out the powers with which their 
Father has endowed them in the 
most complete and proper manner. 
I realize that in order that we 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



109 



may accomplish this, and restrain 
our children from the possibilities 
of immorality and crime, more care 
and thought must be bestowed up- 
on these matters than we have been 
wont to give them in the recent 
past. Not that I would deny any 
boy or girl those proper pleasures 
which relieve them from the toil 
and struggle that some may have to 
undergo in life ; but when they 
break out in open rebellion against 
every principle of good govern- 
ment, when they propose to mingle 
with the vile and the impure, when 
they find companionship pleasurable 
with those whose lives are to be cen- 
sured by every thoughtful father 
and mother, we shall be under con- 
demnation if we permit them with- 
out effort on our part to drift in 
the line of that destruction, and our 
regrets will be great at no distant 
day, for it may be your boys and 
my boys, your girls and my girls, 
that will by their misdeeds bring to 
u? sorrow and heartache. 

I bear my testimony to the truth 
of the Gospel, and to the wisdom 
of the Apostle Paul when he ap- 
pealed to the people to guard 
against becoming more the lovers 
of pleasure than the lovers of God. 
I commend the spirit that has been 
manifest in this conference, in the 
instructions that have fallen from 
the lips of the elders from first to 
last. Reformation is requisite 
among the Latter-day Saints in the 
care we bestow upon the children 
which God has given to us. May 
the Lord bless you with understand- 
ing and faith. May the good work 
move forward in the accomplish- 
ment of its great destiny, that as 
our boys and girls shall go into 
the world they shall be entrenched 
in the moral virtues of the Gospel 
of Jesus, and be clean and sweet 



among the children of men, in the 
fulfillment of the great destiny He 
designs they shall accomplish; that 
they shall indeed not be lovers of 
pleasure more than lovers of God, 
but that they shall be lovers of God 
and enjoyers of legitimate pleas- 
ures, under the influence of the 
good Spirit that comes from on 
high, designed for their uplifting 
and betterment. This is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Emma Ramsey Morris 
sang, as a solo, the hymn, "Come, 
come ye Saints." 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

Priesthood and people are one.— Promi- 
nence provokes criticism. — President 
Joseph F. Smith. — Government by 
consent of the governed. — What it 
means to "sustain" our leaders. — 
Union the price of safety. 

A great many good things have 
been said during this conference, 
and a great many good things re- 
main unsaid. The main care of a 
speaker at such times, is, not to 
find a subject, but to select one, to 
choose the thoughts and ideas that 
will best suit the occasion, and 
then have the power to impress 
them upon the minds and hearts 
of the hearers. No man can do 
this of himself. The Holy Ghost 
is the great teacher, and all that 
God's servants can do, all that they 
are expected to do, is to put them- 
selves in a position and keep them- 
selves in such a state of heart and 
mind that they can be acted upon 
by that divine Spirit which makes 
manifest the things of God. I 
hope I shall have this Spirit during 
the few minutes that I shall stand 
before you. 

Many of the texts dwelt upon 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and elaborated in the previous 
meetings have been drawn from 
the Declaration that was read here 
upon the opening day. Lingering 
in my memory are a few lines of 
that Declaration, which, it seems to 
me, we might profitably reflect 
upon. They run something like 
this : "The effort to differentiate 
the 'Mormon' priesthood and the 
'Mormon' people, by allowing that 
the latter are a good, honest, 
though misguided folk, while al- 
leging that their leaders are the 
personification of all that is bad, 
is a most futile one. The great 
majority of the male members of 
the Church hold the priesthood, and 
though constituting the official 
body of the Church, they are a por- 
tion of the people. Priesthood and 
people are inseparable, and, vindi- 
cated or condemned, stand to- 
gether." I invite your attention to 
these lines. 

Why should it be thought that 
there is a great gulf of difference 
between the priesthood and the 
people of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints? Who 
are these men that have been chos- 
en to be the General Authorities of 
the Church, to be the Presidencies 
of the Stakes of Zion. and the 
Bishoprics of the Wards? Who 
are the men and women that stand 
prominently before the people in 
our auxiliary organizations? Have 
they come from outside the 
Church ? Are they angels from 
Heaven, or demons from Hades, 
immortal beings, sent here to pre- 
side over a mortal Church and its 
departments and institutions? Why, 
no. They have come up from the 
ranks of the people. True, their 
spirits came down from God; but 
so did the spirits of all the members 
of the Church. The spirits of all 
men have come from God, and 



have taken upon them mortal bod- 
ies, to undergo experiences that 
will prepare them for honor and 
glory and eternal lives in the 
worlds to come. But the men who 
have been chosen to preside over 
the Church, over the Stakes of 
Zion, over the various Wards, and 
the men and women who are of- 
ficers in the auxiliary organiza- 
tions- — are only a portion of the 
people. They have the same faults 
and weaknesses, and the same vir- 
tues, as their fathers and mothers, 
and are no better and no worse 
than the average of the people 
from whom they came. 

But because they are prominent, 
because they have been placed on 
high, their weak points are more 
manifest than they would be if they 
had remained where they were. 
They are not one whit more perfect 
for having been lifted into promin- 
ence, although they are expected to 
set an example to the people. 
President Heber C. Kimball was 
once conversing with a friend.when 
he stopped in his talk and picked 
up a twig or stick from the ground. 
It had been raining, and adhering 
to this little stick were particles of 
mud, and he held it up to illustrate 
the conversation. He said to his 
friend, "If that stick had remained 
upon the ground, you would not 
have noticed that it was 
covered with mud, but when 
I lift it up, the mud is about 
all that you can see ; you can 
hardly recognize anything else. 
So it is with men and women when 
they are singled out for positions 
in the Church." How true this is. 
Such men and women become tar- 
gets for criticism ; their faults are 
more apparent, or are more dwelt 
upon, than their virtues, because of 
the positions they hold. 

Who is now the President of 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



Ill 



this Church? He was a "Mor- 
mon" boy, born at Far West, 
Missouri, in the midst of trials and 
tribulations, eleven days, I believe, 
after his father had been torn from 
his wife and children, cast into 
prison and condemned to death. 
His home was sacked and pillaged 
by a mob, who, in their efforts to 
rob the helpless family whose hus- 
band and father had been taken 
from them, tore to pieces a bed 
and tossed it upon the sleeping 
form of an infant child, 
almost smothering him out 
of existence. That child was 
President Joseph F. Smith, born in 
the midst of persecution, cradled in 
peril, enduring from childhood the 
hardships and privations of a pil- 
grim and a pioneer, manifesting 
his faithfulness and integrity in the 
midst of the people; his whole life 
an open book. Finally he becomes 
the head of the Church, chosen of 
God to be His prophet, and sus- 
tained by the people as their presi- 
dent. A "Mormon" boy! 

And who are the Twelve 
Apostles? Who are the First 
Council of the Seventies? Who 
are the Presidents of Stakes, the 
High Councilors and the Bishops? 
They are mostly the sons of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. They are the boys 
who have grown up among you. 
Chosen from the ranks of the peo- 
ple, they have all the virtues and 
all the failings of their ancestors. 
Why look for perfection in them? 
Why expect the priesthood to be 
tetter than the people, or the peo- 
ple to be better than the priest- 
hood? "As with the priest, so 
with the people." They belong to 
the same class ; they are insepar- 
able, "and vindicated or condemn- 
ed, stand together." 

Nevertheless, there is a differ- 
ence between the people and their 



leaders ; it is not a physical differ- 
ence, it is not a moral difference, 
it is not a spiritual difference; it 
is simply this : these men who hold 
authoritative positions in the 
Church have been chosen for those 
positions, not only by God Him- 
self, but also by the people of God. 
That is the difference. Joseph F. 
Smith is God's prophet, because 
God wants him to be; and he is 
our President because we want him 
to be. And he could not be the 
one nor the other a moment past 
the time when he would cease to 
be acceptable to God and to His 
people. Neither could any man, 
nor any woman, in this Church, 
perpetuate their power and author- 
ity beyond the time that God and 
the people were willing to sustain 
them. 

You saw yesterday an exhibition 
of the doctrine of common consent, 
which prevails in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The great principle enunciated in 
the Declaration of Independence, 
that governments derive their just 
powers from the consent of the 
governed, permeates this Church 
and lies at the foundation of its 
government, determining the man- 
ner of the choice of men and wo- 
men to hold office therein. This 
has always been the rule of the 
Church. There is no room in it 
for tyranny, for usurpation, for 
the exercise of unrighteous domin- 
ion. As our President has often 
informed us, this work is not only 
the work of God, it is also our 
work ; every man, woman and child 
in the Church has a personal inter- 
est in this cause and is a joint pro- 
prietor with God in all that pertains 
to it. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, who 
was sustained in the beginning as 
the President of this Church, did 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not make himself the President. 
God chose him to be His Prophet, 
and the people sustained him as 
their President. Yes, this man 
who had looked upon the face of 
the Father and the Son, who had 
communed with angels, who had 
had revealed to him the "sacred 
record" long "concealed," concern- 
ing which we have been singing, 
who had received the imposition 
of hands by holy angels, confer- 
ring upon him the priesthood — the 
Aaronic priesthood, which em- 
powered him to preach faith and 
repentance and to baptize for the 
remission of sins, and the Melchis- 
edek priesthood, which empowered 
him to bestow the Holy Ghost upon 
those who had been baptized, — 
after all these wonderful exhibi- 
tions of the power of God, . this 
man and his associate, Oliver Cow- 
dery, were required to submit their 
names to a little congregation on 
the 6th day of April, 1830, when 
this Church was organized, that it 
might be seen whether or not those 
assembled — a little over thirty in 
number — would sustain them as 
their leaders. They were sustain- 
ed, and thus became the first and 
second elders of the Church. But 
the query arises, Suppose they had 
not been sustained? Suppose that 
little flock had voted against, in- 
stead of for, Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery, what would have 
been the consequence? Would it 
have taken from those two elders 
the priesthood which God ha_d con- 
ferred upon them? Would it have 
taken away the gifts which He had 
given them? Would it have blot- 
ted out the fact that the dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times had 
been opened by the personal ap- 
pearing of the Father and the Son 
to Joseph Smith? Would it have 
re-consigned that sacred record to 



the Hill Cumorah? Would the 
work have gone backward from 
that hour? Not at all. It would 
have had this effect, and this only : 
that little congregation would have 
been without the gifts and powers 
that God had conferred upon those 
men. It could not have been the 
Church of God. It would have 
been a body without a head. The 
priesthood would have been separ- 
ated from the people. The Proph- 
et, just before going to his death, 
speaking to the Nauvoo Legion 
and denouncing mob violence, said 
to them, "Will you stand by me in 
the vindication of these great prin- 
ciples which God has committed to 
my care?" And they threw up 
their hands and shouted "Yes !" 
The Prophet replied, "It is well. 
You are a good people, and I am 
willing to lay down my life for 
you. Had you done otherwise, I 
should have gone out there (point- 
ing to the west) and should have 
raised up a mightier people." This 
shows what would have resulted 
had that little flock, the Church of 
God, on the 6th of April, 1830, re- 
jected Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery as their leaders. They 
could have gone anywhere on 
earth, where men and women 
would have been willing to receive 
them, and could have built up the 
Church and Kingdom. But God 
recognizes the rights of His peo- 
ple, along with the rights of His 
priesthood, which are His own 
rights. God and His people 
constitute this Church, and these 
men who have been chosen to be 
the teachers, the counselors, the 
leaders are the Lord's servants, 
His representatives, the instru- 
ments and agents through whom 
He acts, to guide and bless His 
people. 

I want to remind this great con- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY.

gregation that you who raised your 
hands to sustain these men in their 
positions, made a solemn coven- 
ant with God that you would sus- 
tain them in very deed. In effect, 
you covenanted that you would 
pray for them, that you would up- 
hold and defend them, that you 
would exercise your faith for them, 
and would listen to their counsels ; 
and that you would not go forth 
from this conference to tear down 
these men, to stab them in the 
back, and seek to weaken their in- 
fluence among your brethren and 
sisters and among the children of 
men. You made that covenant. 
See that you keep it; for it was 
a covenant with God, and cannot 
be broken with impunity. You 
had the power to reject any and all 
but you chose to sustain them. Now 
see that you do it. 

There is little danger to this 
work from the outside. The worst 
perils that threaten us are always 
from within. God has pledged 
His word that this kingdom shall 
never be thrown down nor given to 
another people. But if there ever 
was a time when this work was 
really in danger, it was because 
there was something wrong within, 
and not because the powers of 
earth and hell were arrayed against 
it. A captain of a ship in a storm 
was approached and asked if there 
was any danger. The tempests 
had been beating upon the vessel 
for days; she had been driven out 
of her course ; the waves were roll- 
ing mountain high; the appearance 
of things was perilous, and the 
passengers were fearful. "Cap- 
tain, is there danger?" asked one. 
The Captain smiled reassuringly, 
and replied, "Not one particle, so 
long as conditions remain as they 
now are. I have been down be- 



low; I have examined the machin- 
ery ; every wheel is moving as it 
was ordained to move ; every pin is 
in its place ; every man is at his 
post; everything is working well, 
and as long as this continues, there 
is no danger whatever; but," he 
added, "if a single wheel refused 
to move, if a single pin were out 
of place, if a man were to rebel 
and mutiny, there would be dan- 
ger that we might all go to the bot- 
tom of the sea." I think this an 
apt illustration of the Church of 
God, of the good ship Zion, plung- 
ing her way majestically through 
the billows of tribulation in this 
world of pain and trouble and 
tears. So long as we serve God, 
and are one with each other, the 
storms that come from without and 
spend their fury upon us, pass 
harmlessly over; they only have 
the effect of driving us together, 
making us feel for one another, 
love one another, and strengthen 
one another. But let there be ope 
traitor in the camp; let there be 
disobedience, treachery, indiffer- 
ence, or division in the Church, and 
the danger is great until that con- 
dition is removed. But God has 
pledged His word that this work 
shall never be thrown down, and 
it is my faith and my testimony 
that if we remain united, if we re- 
fuse to listen to those insidious 
voices that would introduce schism 
and dissension between the people 
and their leaders ; if we present an 
unbroken front, and are one in 
faith and practice of the principles 
of the Gospel ; if the priesthood and 
the people stand together, then 
shall the good ship Zion weather 
every storm and land her precious 
cargo of souls in the harbor of 
eternal peace. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn commencing, "Praise to 
the man who communed with Je- 
hovah." 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Need of preparation to perform Priest- 
hood duties. — Admonition to Priest- 
hood and Saints to set themselves 
in order. — Experienced missionaries 
should accompany the inexperienced. 
— 'The Lord is pleased with His peo- 
ple," and guiding His Church. 

The time of our conference is 
very precious, and I presume every 
one who occupies a portion of it 
feels as though he were in a hurrv. 
and perhaps the congregation some- 
times wishes that the speaker would 
hurry. 

This has been one of the most 
interesting conferences that the 
Latter-day Saints have ever held, 
and I believe that it will prove most 
profitable to the Latter-day Saints 
for all time. I am convinced that 
our faith will be strengthened, and 
that we will return to our homes 
better prepared for our ministry. 
When I listened to the elders who 
are presiding over the missions 
abroad, I was admonished that it 
is very important that the body of 
the Priesthood be suitably trained 
and prepared for the great work en- 
trusted to our care. It is important 
that we should be well trained from 
our first reception of the Priest- 
hood, for no man is fully justified 
who does not magnify the author- 
ity which the Lord confers upon 
him. This authority, held by nearly 
all the male members of the Church, 
has come from the Lord, through 
His servants ; and we are a Church 
of ministers, teachers, exhorters, 
expounders of the faith and of the 



Scriptures, and are expected to be 
laboring, efficiently and acceptably, 
at home and abroad. Missionaries 
are constantly being called for from 
among the Latter-day Saints ; hun- 
dreds of them are needed every 
year. This Church, I suppose, is 
doing more in the line of mission- 
ary work than any other people of 
the same number. All the churches 
have their force of ministers ; but 
1 know of no church, except this 
that is made up entirely of minis- 
ters. The ministry in this Church 
is not confined to the male mem- 
bers ; for our sisters are also teach- 
ers, and advocates, and expounders 
of the faith. They have a work in 
the ministry, besides taking care of 
their homes and families ; but of 
course they are almost entirely 
home missionaries. A few of our 
sisters have gone into the world to 
preach the Gospel, and I suppose 
there is no sister in the Church but 
what would go as readily as the 
brethren if she were called. And 
that is the difference in Church- 
membership between the brethren 
and the sisters, just as Elder Whit- 
ney has explained the difference be- 
tween the authorities of the Church 
and the people. The Elders are 
called and designated by the voice 
of the Lord, through His servants, 
and sustained by the people, to hold 
the Priesthood, to officiate in the 
foreign ministry, and to preside in 
the affairs of the Church generally. 
The brethren are supposed to be in 
the work from the time they are 
ordained. 

The Spirit seems to prompt me 
on this occasion to draw the atten- 
tion, particularly, of the presiding 
brethren in the Stakes, and Wards, 
and quorums to the necessity of 
giving more care to the interests of 
the brethren entrusted to their 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



115 



presidency. We want you to give a 
little closer attention to their condi- 
tion. The brethren who have spok- 
en in this conference have seemed 
inclined to commend to us the im- 
portance of the Word of Wisdom. 
I believe that the presiding breth- 
ren in the Church set a suitable ex- 
ample before you, and we feel that 
it should be carried out by all the 
various quorums and departments 
of the Priesthood. You should 
give greater thought and care to 
your own condition, my brethren 
who stand in responsible positions. 
In this regard I commend to you 
the counsel of the Twelve and the 
brethren who preside over us, that 
we take particular pains to exam- 
ine ourselves, and to be examined 
by one another, to be considered, 
questioned, trained, instructed, cor- 
rected and reproved, and to be ex- 
horted and placed in order, as you 
have heard from President Joseph 
F. Smith. We report to him our 
condition ; we want you to report to 
us in regard to your condition. We 
would like you to take particular 
pains with your brethren. Having 
first set yourselves in order, set 
your brethren in order — the High 
Priests, Seventies, Elders, and 
members of the lesser priesthood ; 
tor you are held responsible, as 
we are. The First Presidency sure- 
ly feel that the Twelve should al- 
ways be in good condition ; and 
when any of these brethren visit 
you, we would like you to notice 
them and follow in their footsteps 
and good examples. You presidents 
of Stakes and you Bishops, when 
you are within reach of the Twelve, 
ask what instructions they have for 
you and for your assistants in the 
Priesthood. What is necessary to 
be done? How shall we take care 
of those holding the Priesthood who 



are entrusted to us. These are 
questions it would be well for 
you to ask of the brethren, and they 
will counsel you. This applies to 
ail the brethren who have the forces 
of Israel to direct in the different 
Stakes and Wards and quorums. 
We ask you to put these forces in 
order. 

As the work requires and as the 
Lord directs, we make requisitions 
upon the Presidents of Stakes. We 
need twenty elders, or forty or fifty, 
as the case may be, from your Stake. 
We wish you to furnish us 
one-third of them veterans, men 
who have seen service either 
at home or abroad, men who 
are established in the faith, and 
who have ability and integrity. 
One-third of all we ask for 
should be trained material, that 
the young and inexperienced may 
feel in the presence of these, tried 
and proven men that they have 
strength and support, and that they 
can follow in their footsteps and 
take instruction from them. How 
well I remember when I went to 
Europe in 1860, with President Jos- 
eph F. Smith and others. We were 
young men at that time, and when 
I was sent out into the missionary 
field I was placed in the care and 
company of John Brown, the late 
Bishop and Patriarch, of Pleasant 
Grove. Joseph C. Rich, son of El- 
der Charles C. Rich, was placed in 
company with James S. Brown. 
These were two mature, able men, 
expounders of the faith, men of ex- 
perience, men of God. So it was 
with the rest of the brethren. Broth - 
er Joseph F. Smith did not need an 
experienced man with him, for he 
was already trained, having been 
four years on the Sandwich Islands, 
where he had been a faithful and 
devoted elder. He was a veteran, 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



although a young man. He had 
had training and experience such 
as we had not received. The Pres- 
idents of missions should have in 
the field at least one-third of train- 
ed men, and we ask you to furnish 
that kind to us. We expect them 
to be in good condition, clean and 
sweet. We do not want to have to 
purge and cleanse them when thev 
come here. Bishops, labor with 
your young men. If they have any 
faults and failings, let them be cor- 
lected, and reproved if necessary, 
at home. Do not let them be hu- 
miliated before the brethren when 
they come here. Have them so well 
prepared that we shall be proud of 
them. Take pains with them, and 
do not leave it for us to do. I do 
not leave it for the Presidency to 
train these brethren of the Twelve. 
I take particular pains with my 
brethren, and they take particular 
pains with me. It is their business 
to help me, and it is my business to 
help them. We wish you to help 
one another, and train one another, 
so that all will be in good condi- 
tion and none will be ashamed. I 
would be ashamed, and so would 
my brethren, if President Smith had 
to stand up here and say that the 
Twelve were not in order, that they 
would not listen to him, nor take in- 
struction from him, and that they 
would not reform and improve 
That would not do at all. No; we 
try to labor with ourselves. We 
1 ave our weaknesses, and we neee 
to be trained and cared for, just 
vhe same as you and your brethren 
We are of the same kind of mater- 
ial, the same kind of flesh and 
blood. We are of the roval lineage, 
just as you are ; for we have de- 
scended from the Father ; our Fath- 
er who is in heaven, and your Fath- 
er. We are His sons, and our wives 



and sisters are His daughters. 
There is no lineage more roval than 
that of the Father and the Son. We 
are the brethren of Jesus, and you, 
my sisters, are His sisters. 

Now, the Lord is pleased with 
His people and their condition to- 
day. I thank the Lord for what 
we have witnessed here, and for the 
union that dwells among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I speak in this way 
because I realize the Bishops, the 
Presidents and their Counselors, 
and the High Councilors are here, 
and we require and expect of you 
just what the Presidency require 
and expect of us. The Presidency 
would not be satisfied unless these 
Apostles were proper in their con- 
duct and in their lives. When they 
travel among you, the Presidency 
feel that the" are properly repre- 
sented, and that the Lord is prop- 
erly represented among His people. 
Our lives are before them, as they 
are before you, and they have n ) 
fear concerning us; we have been 
before you as long as you can re- 
member us. Now, we want vour 
lives to be at least as good as ours. 
No man should be worse than we 
are. It is not pleasing to the Lord 
that your lives should be worse than 
curs. We want you to be better, to 
set us a good example, and to help 
us. You pray for us ; we want you 
to live and labor with us. Bishops, 
it is a reproach to you when you 
send men to us that are not in a 
proper condition, and that have to 
be labored with here, or at Liver- 
pool, or in any other mission, by 
the authorities. We ask you to 
send them to us in proper condition, 
that we may know they are con- 
scientious, honest, undefiled, pure 
and clean, that we shall not be 
ashamed of their conduct when they 
go out into the world. The life of 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN.

an elder is more to the people than 
anything he says. The chief thing: 
is what a man does. It was what 
Jesus did, the example He set, that 
lifts Him above all others. He 
walked in the fear of God. He 
loved the Father and honored Him. 
He did the Father's will, instead of 
his own. He was submissive to 
Him. He was without sin. He set 
the pattern for us. We should be 
as like Him as it is possible for us 
to be. ♦ 

I have felt thankful to the Lord 
for the ministry of our brethren in 
this conference. How beautifully 
and splendidly they have talked to 
us ! In the doctrines they have laid 
down no mistake has been made. I 
bear testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters in regard to this Church. 
From its beginning, with thirty or 
forty members, on the 6th day of 
April, 1830, I testify to you— for 
I know as I know that I live — 
that this Church has been and is the 
Church of Jesus Christ. It is the 
work of the Lord. It was brought 
to the world and established under 
the personal direction of the Father 
and the Son. Such a vision and 
experience was never given before 
on this earth, so far as we have 
any account, as the personal ap- 
pearing of the Father and the Son 
at the same time. The voice of the 
Father had been heard several 
times, presenting His Son ; but it 
was left for the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, in the nineteenth century, 
to be the witness of the Father and 
the Son, that they live, for they 
both appeared to him in person. 
And surely the world needed that 
witness. No man had seen the 
Father or the Son for many cen- 
turies. Their faces had been hid 
from the world, until the world had 
come to believe that God was not a 



person at all, that He was not re- 
ally our Father, that we were not 
in His likeness ; or, if He was a 
personage, that in some mysterious 
way the Father, the Son and the 
Holy Ghost were just one person. 
It remained for the Prophet Josenh 
Smith to bear record to the world 
that the Father and the Son both 
lived, and that they are as separate 
and distinct in their personalities as 
any father and son on this earth. 

I bear testimony that this Church 
was organized by the Lord, and He 
has maintained that organization 
from the Prophet Joseph Smith 
down to the Prophet Joseph F. 
Smith, without any mistake ; for 
God has directed the choice of ev- 
ery President, every Counselor, ev- 
ery Apostle, every President of 
Stake, and every Bishop in this 
Church. The Lord has done it, 
and it has not been the work of 
man. He has designated these 
men, by His own Spirit and voice, 
and they stand just where they 
belong, and they will always stand 
there as long as they are worthy 
and are not placed in some other 
position. The Lord is caring for 
His work and for His people, and 
He will do it to the end. I want 
this testimony to come to this con- 
gregation, and to all Israel. It is 
our business to do our duty and 
to perform our part of the work ; 
for, as Elder Whitnev has testified, 
we are interested in it as well as the 
Lord. We share with Him, as His 
children and His trusted servants 
The Gosoel has been delivered to 
us, it is in our hands, and we are 
exnected to be the expounders and 
teachers of this faith until the- 
world is filled with the light and 
knowledge and power of God. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

(closing remarks.) 

I desire to say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, God" bless you. I 
invoke the favor and protecting 
care, the mercy, forgiveness and 
loving kindness of the Father of 
light, in whom there is no variable- 
ness nor shadow of turning, upon 
all the Latter-day Saints, and upon 
all the honest in heart and upright 
in all the world. May the Lord 
God bless the people of this State 
and of the nation, as well as the 
rulers of the nation. May peace 
reign in the midst of all the peo- 
ple. May the strife, contention and 
discontent which exists more or less 
all over our land be settled amica- 
bly, that peace may dwell withi i 
our borders, and that our people 
may be prosnerous and happy, and 
continue to grow in power, num- 
ber and glory in the land. May the 
Lord God bless the President of 
the United States, and his Cabi- 
net, and all the honorable men in 
public life in our nation, and in the 
other nations of the world, that 
peace may dwell on earth and good 
will towards man. 

Our mission is to save, to pre- 
serve from evil, to exalt mankind, 
to bring light and truth into the 
world, to prevail upon the people of 
the earth to walk righteously before 
God, and to honor Him in their 
lives and with the firstfruits of all 
their substance and increase that 
their barns may be filled with plen- 
ty, and, figuratively speaking, that 
"their presses may burst out with 
new wine."' 

May God bless the Presidents of 
the Stakes of Zion and their coun- 
selors, and all the officers in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. May He help them to 



be pure, holy, honest, upright men, 
after God's own heart, free from 
the sins of the world, broadminded, 
full of the love of truth, charity, the 
spirit of forgiveness, mercy and 
kindness, that they may be as fath- 
ers indeed in the midst of the peo- 
ple, and not tyrants. You, mv 
brethren, are not called to be mas- 
ters; you are called to be servants. 
Let him that would be great amon«- 
you be the servant of all. Let us 
follow in the footsteps*of our Mas 
ter, the Lord Jesus Christ. He 
alone is the perfect example for 
mankind. He is the only infallible 
rule and law, way and door into 
everlasting life. Let us follow the 
Son of God. Make Him our ex- 
emplar and our guide. Imitate Him. 
Do His works. Become like unto 
Him, as far as it lies within our 
power to become like Him that 
was perfect and without sin. 

God bless the mothers in Zion, 
and the sons and daughters of Is- 
rael, and keep our children from 
the ways of the world, from trans- 
gression and from temptation that 
will lead them astray. May the pow- 
er of God be over all the household 
of faith. May Israel flourish upon 
the hills and rejoice upon the moun- 
tains, and assemble together unto 
the place which God has appointed, 
and there prosper, multiply and 
replenish the earth, and thence 
spread abroad throughout the 
land ; for the time will come 
when we will find it necessary 
to fulfill the purposes of the 
Almighty by occupying the land of 
Zion in all parts of it. We are not 
destined to be confined to the val- 
levs of the mountains. Zion is des- 
tined to grow, and the time will 
come when we will cry aloud, more 
than we do today, Give us room 
that we may dwell ! 



F RESIDENT JOSEPH E. SMITH. 



119 



Now may the Lord God of Israel 
bless you, my brethren, my sisters 
and my friends. May the mercy of 
God be extended unto our enemies. 
We wish them good, not evil. They 
will bring sufficient evil upon them- 
selves by the course they pursue, 
and we need not wish evil to come 
.upon them for it will come soon 
enough if they do not repent. May 
God have mercy upon them. 
May He turn the erring from 
the error of their way, and 
he that wandereth into the paths 
of certainty and truth. This 
is my prayer, and I invoke these 
blessings upon this great congrega- 
tion and upon all the people of the 
Lord throughout the land, in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

AN ADDRESS 



THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF 
LATTER-DAY SAINTS TO 
THE WORLD 




"Let fads be submitted to a candid world." 



SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, 
APRIL, 1907. 



The Church of Jesus ChrisT: of Latter-day Saints 
to the World, 

GREETING : 

In the hope of correcting misrepresentation, and of es- 
tablishing a more perfect understanding respecting ourselves 
and our religion, we, the officers and members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in General Con- 
ference assembled, issue this Declaration. 

Such an action seems imperative. Never were our prin- 
ciples or our purposes more widely misrepresented, more se- 
riously misunderstood. Our doctrines are distorted, the sacred 
ordinances of our religion ridiculed, our Christianity ques- 
tioned, our history falsified, our character traduced, and our 
course of conduct as a people reprobated and condemned. 

In answer to the charges made against us, for ourselves and 
for those who, under divine direction, founded our religion and 
our Church ; for our posterity, to whom we shall transmit 
the faith, and into whose keeping we shall give the Church of 
Christ ; and before mankind, whose opinions we respect, we sol ■ 
emnly declare the truth to be : 

Our religion is founded on the revelations of G.jd. 
The Gospel we proclaim is the Gospel of Christ, restoied to 
earth in this the dispensation of the fulness of times. The 
high claim of the Church is declared in its title — The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Established 
by divine direction, its name was prescribed by Him whose 
Church it is — Jesus the Christ. 

The religion of this people is pure Christianity. Its creed 
is expressive of the duties of practical life. Its theology is 
based on the doctrines of the Redeemer. 

If it be true Christianity to accept Jesus Christ in 
person and in mission as divine ; to revere Him as the Son 
of God, the crucified and risen Lord, through whom alone can 
mankind attain salvation ; to accept -His teachings as a guide, to 
adopt as a standard and observe as a law the ethical code He 
piomulgated ; to comply with the requirements prescribed bv 



4 



Him as essential to membership in His Church, namely, faith, 
repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, 
and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, — 
if this be Christianity, then are we Christians, and the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Lattei-day Saints is a Christian church. 

The theology of our Church is the theology taught 
by Jesus Christ and His apostles, the theology of scrip- 
ture and reason. It not only acknowledges the sacredness of an- 
cient scripture, and the binding force of divinely-inspired 
acts and utterances in ages past; but also declares that God 
now speaks to man in this final Gospel dispensation. 

We believe in the Godhead, comprising the three individ- 
ual personages, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 

We hold that man is verily the child of God, formed in His 
image, endowed with divine attributes, and possessing power to 
rise from the gross desires of earth to the ennobling aspirations 
of heaven. 

We believe in the pre-existence of man as a spirit, and in a 
future state of individual existence, in which every soul shall 
find its place, as determined by justice and mercy, with opportu- 
nities of endless progression, in the varied conditions of eter- 
nity. 

We believe in the free agency of man, and therefore 
in his individual responsibility. 

We believe that salvation is for no select few, but 
that all men may be saved through obedience to the laws 
and ordinances of the Gospel. 

We affirm that to administer in the ordinances of the Gos- 
pel, authority must be given of God ; and that this authority is 
the power of the Holy Priesthood. 

We affirm that through the ministration of immortal 
personages, the Holy Priesthood has been conferred upon 
men in the present age, and that under this divine authority 
the Church of Christ has been organized. 

We proclaim the objects of this organization to be, the 
pi eachinc of the Gospel in all the world, the gathering of scat- 
tered Israel, and the preparation of a people for the coming of 
the Lord. 

"Mormonism" seeks its converts among all classes and con- 
ditions of society, and those who accept it are among the best 
men and women of the nations from which they come — honest, 
industrious, virtuous, and reverent. In their community life 
they are peaceable, law-abiding and exemplary. Their in-

stincts, traditions and training are opposed to vice and crime. 
The icligion they have embraced, the Church of which they 
are members, condemns every form of evil, and their lives, 
with few exceptions, are exponents of righteousness. Many of 
the early proselytes to our faith were descendants of the Pil- 
grims and Puritans. Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and other 
leaders among the Latter-day Saints, traced their lineaee to the 
founders and first defenders of the nation. Joseph Smith was a 
native of Vermont, and by vocation a farmer. All trades and 
piofessions were drawn upon for the membership of the Church. 
In England, its first foreign mission field, it was mainly the 
middle and working classes that responded to the Gospel mes- 
sage. All over the world it has been the same, — our converts 
have been men and women of character, intelligence, and integ- 
rity. There is nothing in "Mormonism" to attract the selfish or 
the vile. 

The effort to differentiate the "Mormon" priesthood and 
the "Mormon" people, by allowing that the latter are a good, 
honest, though misguided folk, while alleging that their lead- 
ers are the personification of all that is bad, is a most futile 
one. The great majority of the male members of the Church 
hold the priesthood, and though constituting the official body 
of the Church, they are a portion of the people. Priesthood and 
people are inseparable, and; vindicated or condemned, stand 
together. 

The charge that the Church relies upon duplicity in the pro- 
pagation of her doctrines, and shuns enlightened investigation, 
is contrary to reason and fact. Deceit and fraud in the per- 
petuation of any religion must end in failure. A system of re- 
ligion, ethics, or philosophy, to attract and hold the attention of 
men. must be sincere in doctrine and honest in propaganda. That 
the Church employs deceptive methods ; that she has one doc- 
trine for the priesthood and another for the people ; that she 
teaches one set of principles to her members in Zion, and an- 
other to the world, is not true. Enlightened investigation is the 
very means through which the Church hopes to promote belief 
in her principles, and extend the beneficent influence of 
her institutions. From the beginning, enlightened inves- 
tigation has been the one thing she has sought. To secure 
this she has sent her missionaries into all parts of the world, 
especially to the centres of civilization and enlightenment, 
where her literature has been freely distributed; yet too fre- 
quently her claims have been disallowed without inves- 



6 



tigation, and judgment has been pronounced without a hearing-. 
At the Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the four 
hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, the re- 
ligions of the world were represented in a great parliament, 
for the purpose of showing "in the most impressive way, 
what and how many important truths the various religions hold 
and teach in common ; .... to set forth by those most 
competent to speak, what are deemed the important distinctive 
truths held and taught by each religion ; .... to in- 
quire what light each religion has afforded or may afford to 
the other religions of the world." To this gathering the 
Church of Jesus Christ ~f Latter-day Saints, though the most 
distinctively American church, was not invited ; nevertheless she 
sought opportunity to place side by side with the creeds of all 
the great historic faiths, a presentation of her principles, and to 
voice to mankind the truths she deemed most important and 
most helpful. This opportunity was denied the Church, ex- 
cept upon such terms as were humiliating and subversive of 
the end sought — a wider publication and a more just con- 
sideration of her faith. After such an experience, and oth- 
ers of like kind, though of varying degree, we submit that 
it ill becomes our accusers to charge us with shunning en- 
liehtened investigation. 

It has been charged that "Mormonism" is opposed to 
education. The history of the Church and the pre- 
cepts of its leaders are a sufficient answer to that accusation. 
Joseph Smith, the first President of the Church, founded 
schools, and attended them as a student, as did many 
of his followers under his advice and influence. Brigham 
Young, who succeeded Joseph Smith, emulated him as a 
founder and patron of schools : and every subsequent Presi- 
dent of the Church, his associates, and the people generally, 
have been equally zealous in that cause. In the course of their 
exodus from Illinois, our people built log school houses while 
halting on the Missouri river, then the frontier of the nation ; 
and after they had traversed a thousand miles of wilderness, and 
planted their infant colony in the valley of the Great Salt 
Lake, school houses were amon.r the first buildings they 
erected. Such Las been the course pursued in every "Mor- 
mon" colony. The State of Utah, now dotted with free 
schools, academies, colleges, and universities, institutions 
which have given her marked educational prominence, 
furnishes indisputable evidence that her people — mostly 



"Mormons" — are friends and promoters of education. To 
the Latter-day Saints, salvation itself, under the atonement 
of Christ, is a process of education. That knowledge is a means 
of eternal progress, was taught by Joseph Smith : — It is impos- 
sible for a man to be saved in ignorance. — A man is saved no 
faster than he gets knowledge. — The glory of God is intelli- 
gence. — Whatever principles of intelligence we attain to in this 
life, will rise with us in the resurrection. — He who gains in this 
life more knowledge than another, will have so much the advan- 
tage in the world to come. These were aphorisms with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

Neither is it true, as alleged, that "Mormonism" is de- 
structive of the sanctity of the marriage relation ; on the con- 
trary it regards the lawful union of man and woman as the 
means through which they may realize their highest and 
holiest aspirations. To the Latter-day Saints, marriage is not 
designed by our heavenly Father to be merely an earthly union, 
but one that shall survive the vicissitudes of time, and endure 
for eternity, bestowing honor and joy in this world, glory 
and eternal lives in the worlds to come. 

The typical "Mormon" home is the temple of the family, in 
which the members of the household gather morning and eve- 
ning, for prayer and praise to God, offered in the name of Jesus 
Christ, and often accompanied by the reading of scripture and 
the singing of spiritual songs. Here are taught and gently 
enforced, the moral precepts and religious truths, 
which, taken together, make up that righteousness which exalt- 
eth a nation, and ward off that sin which is a reproach to any 
people. If such conditions are not a sufficient answer to the 
charge that our homes are un-Christian, subversive of moral 
influence, and destructive of the state's stability, then we turn 
to the present generations, "Mormon" American citizens, pro- 
ducts of our religion and our homes, for our vindication: — 
Here are our sons and daughters, submit them to any 
test of comparison you will : regard for truth, veneration 
for age, reverence for God, love of man, loyalty to country, 
respect for law, refinement of manners, and, lastly, in this is- 
sue between us and our accusers the crowning test of all, 
purity of mind and chastity of conduct. It is not inordinate self 
praise to say of the generations of our people, born and reared 
ii; "Mormon" homes, that they will compare favorably, in the 
Christian virtues, and in all that makes for good citizenship, 
with any community in this or any other country.

The charge that the Church is a commercial rather than a 
religious institution; that its aims are temporal rather than 
spiritual; that it dictates its members in their industrial 
activities and relations, and aims at absolute domination 
in temporal affairs, — all this we emphatically deny. That the 
Church claims the right to counsel and advise her members in 
temporal as well as in spiritual affairs is admitted. Leading 
Church officials, men of practical experience in pioneer life, 
have aided the people in establishing settlements throughout 
the inter-mountain west, and have given them, gratuitously, the 
benefit of their broader knowledge of things, through counsel 
and direction, which the people have followed to their advan- 
tage ; and both the wisdom of the leaders and the good 
sense of the people are vindicated in the results achieved. 
All this has been done without the exercise of arbitrary 
power. It has resulted from wise counsels, persuasively given 
and willingly followed. 

It has also been the policy of the Church to foster 
home industries. Where there has been a lack of confi- 
dence in some of these enterprises, and private capital has 
been afraid to invest, the Church has furnished funds that 
the practicability of the undertaking might be demonstrat- 
ed ; and repeatedly the wisdom of this policy has been 
made manifest. Thereby the resources of various localities 
have been developed, community industries diversified, 
and the people, especially the poor, given increased op- 
portunity of employment and a better chance to become self- 
sustaining. 

We deny the existence of arbitrary power in the Church; 
and this because its government is moral government purely, 
and its forces are applied through kindness, reason, 
and persuasion. Government by consent of the pw- 
erned is the rule of the Church. Following is a sum- 
mary of the word of the Lord, setting forth the principles 
on which, the Church government is to be administered : 

The rights of the priesthood are inseparably con- 
nected with the powers of heaven, and the powers of 
heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the 
principles of righteousness. That they may be con- 
ferred upon men, is true ; but when they undertake to 
cover their sins, or gratify their pride, their vain ambi- 
tion, or exercise control, or dominion, or compulsion, up- 
on the souls of the children of men, in any degree of un- 



9 



righteousness, the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when 
it is withdrawn, amen to the priesthood, or the author- 
ity of that man. No power or influence can or 
ought to be maintained b*<- virtue of the priesthood, only 
by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness, and meek- 
nes.', and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure 
knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without 
hypocrisy and without guile. 

Nominations to Church office may be made by revelation ; 
and the right of nomination is usually exercised by those hold- 
ing high authority, but it is a law that no person is to be ordained 
to any office in the Church, where there is a regularly or- 
ganized branch of the same, without the vote of its members. 
This law is operative as to all the officers of the Church, from 
the president down to the deacon. The ecclesiastical govern- 
ment itself exists by the will of the people; elections are fre- 
quent, and the members are at liberty to vote as they choose. 
True, the elective principle here operates by popular acceptance, 
rather than through popular selection, but it is none the 
less real. Where the foregoing facts exist as to any sys- 
tem, it is not and cannot be arbitrary. 

The Church officers, in the exercise of their functions, 
are answerable to the Church. No officer, however exalt- 
ed his position, is exempt from this law. All decisions, 
rulings and conduct of officials are subject to investiga- 
tion, correction, revision and final rejection by the gen- 
eral assembly of the priesthood of the Church, its final court of 
appeal. Even the President, its highest officer, is subject to these 
laws, and special provision is made for his trial, and, if neces- 
sary, his deposition. Where these facts exist in any 
administration of government, it cannot be justly classed 
as a tyranny, nor considered a menace to free institutions. 

The tithing: system of the Church, so often de- 
nounced as oppressive, and as imposing an arbitrary ec- 
clesiastical tax, is in reality a system of free-will offerings. 
True, the members, by the law of the Church, are under 
moral obligation to pay one-tenth of their interest annu- 
ally. But from the very nature of the principles on which 
churches exist, they being voluntary associations for the 
fostering of spiritual life, and the achievement of moral 
and charitable ends — in which associations membership 
cannot be compelled — there is no compulsory means 
of collecting this or any other church revenue. Tithing 



10 



is a voluntary offering for religious and charitable purposes, 
and not a scheme of extortion for the enrichment of the higher 
officials. Service in the interest of the Church is given, for the 
most part, without monetary compensation; where compen- 
sation is allowed it is moderate; the high Church officials are 
not rich, but in the majority of cases are men of limited means, 
and where it is otherwise their wealth did not come from the 
tithes of the people; — these facts are a complete refutation of 
the slander that our tithing is a system of extortion practiced 
upon the people for the enrichment of the priesthood. Like the 
Church government throughout, the tithing system operates 
upon the principle of free will and the consent of those who 
hold the faith to be divine. 

Neither in mental attitude nor in conduct have we 
been disloyal to the government under whose guarantee 
of religious freedom our Church was founded. The Book 
of Mormon proclaims America to be the land of Zion ; a 
land dedicated to righteousness and liberty ; a land of 
promise to certain branches of the house of Israel, and 
also to the Gentiles. It declares that. God will fortify 
this land against all other nations ; and "he that fightetn 
against Zion shall perish." By revelation to Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, the Lord declared that he had established 
the Constitution of the United States through "wise men 
raised up unto this very purpose." It is also our belief that 
God has blessed and prospered this nation, and given unto 
it power to enforce the divine decrees concerning the 
land of Zion. that free institutions might not perish from 
the earth. Cherishing such convictions, we have no 
place in our hearts for disloyal sentiments, nor is there 
likelihood of treason in our conduct. Were we evil-dis- 
posed toward American institutions, or disloyal to the 
United States, we would be recreant to those principles 
to which by interest and education we are attached, and 
would repudiate the revelations of God concerning this 
land. 

In reaffirming our belief in the high destiny of America, 
our attachment to American institutions, and our loyalty to the 
United States, we declare that these sentiments, this loyalty, 
have outlived the memory of all the wrongs inflicted upon our 
fathers and ourselves. 

. If patriotism and loyalty are qualities manifested 
in times of peace, by just, temperate, benevolent, industrious, 



11 



and virtuous living; in times of trial, by patience, resistance 
only by lawful means to real or fancied wrongs, and by final 
submission to the laws of the land, though involving distress 
and sorrow ; and in time of war, by willingness to fight the bat- 
tles of the nation, — then, unquestionably, are the "Mormon" 
people patriotic and loyal. 

The only conduct seemingly inconsistent with our pro- 
fessions as loyal citizens, is that involved in our atti- 
tude during the controversies that have arisen respecting plural 
marriage. This principle was introduced by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, at Nauvoo, Illinois. The practice was continued in 
Utah, and published to the world, as a doctrine of the Church, 
in 1852. In the face of these facts, Brigham Young, whose 
position in the matter was well known, was twice appointed, 
with the consent of the Senate, first by President Fillmore, and 
afterwards by President Pierce, to be the Governor of the Terri- 
tory. It was not until 1862 that Congress enacted a law forbid- 
ding plural marriage. This law the Latter-day Saints consci- 
entiously disregarded, in their observance of a principle 
sanctioned by their religion. Moreover they believed the 
enactment to be violative of the Constitution, which pro- 
vides that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the 
free exercise of religion. Notwithstanding this attitude and 
conduct on the part of our people, no decision of 
the Supreme Court upon this question was secured un- 
til 1878, more than thirty years after the settlement of 
Utah ; nor were determined efforts made to enforce the 
law until a further period of five or six years had elapsed. 
Surely this toleration, under which the practice of plural 
marriage became firmly established, binds the United 
States and its people, if indeed they are not bound by con- 
siderations of mercy and wisdom, to the exercise of pa- 
tience and charity in dealing with this question. 

If it be charged by those who find extenuation for 
offenses committed prior to the decision of 1878, that our 
subsequent duty as good citizens was clear and unmis- 
takeable, we reply that the situation, as viewed by some 
of our members, developed a conflict between duty to 
Cod and duty to the government. Moreover, it was 
thought possible that the decision of the Supreme' Court 
might be reversed, if what was regarded as a con- 
stitutional right were not too easily surrendered. What our 
people did in disregard of the law and of the decisions of the 



12 



Supreme Court affecting plural marriages, was in the spirit of 
maintaining religious rights under constitutional guaranties, 
and not in any spirit of defiance or disloyalty to the govern- 
ment. 

The "Mormon" people have bowed in respectful submis- 
sion to the laws enacted against plural marriage. While it is 
true that for many years they contested the constitu- 
tionality of the law of Congress, and during that 
time acted in harmony with their religious convictions in up- 
holding by practice, as well as by spoken and written word, a 
principle committed to them from God, still, when every means 
of constitutional defense had been exhausted, the Church 
abandoned the controversy and announced its intention 
to be obedient to the laws of the land. Subsequently, 
when statehood for Utah became a possibility, on the condi- 
tion that her constitution provide by ordinance, irrevocable 
without the consent of the United States, that plural marriages 
should be forever prohibited, the "Mormon" people accepted 
the condition by voting for the adoption of the constitu- 
tion. From that time until now, the Church has been 
true to its pledge respecting the abandonment of the prac- 
tice of plural marriage. If it be urged that there have been 
instances of the violation of the anti-polygamy laws, and that 
some persons within the Church have sought to evade the 
rule adopted by her, prohibiting plural marriages, the plain 
answer is that in every state and nation there are individuals 
who violate law in spite of all the vigilance that can be exer- 
cised ; but it does not follow that the integrity of a community 
or a state is destroyed, because of such individual transgres- 
sions. All we ask is that the same common-sense judgment 
be exercised in relation to our community that is accorded to 
other communities. When all the circumstances are weighed, 
the wonder is, not that there have been sporadic cases of plural 
marriage, but that such cases have been so few. It should 
be remembered that a religious conviction existed among the 
people, holding this order of marriage to be divinely sanc- 
tioned. Little wonder then that there should appear, in a 
community as large as ours, and as sincere, a few over-zealous 
irdividuals who refused to submit even to the action of the 
Church in such a matter, or that these few should find others 
who sympathized with their views; the number, however, is 
small. ... 

Those who refer to "Mormon polygamy" as a menace to 



13 



the American home, or as a serious factor in American prob- 
lems, make themselves ridiculous. So far as plural marriage is 
concerned, the question is settled. The problem of polygamous 
living among our people is rapidly solving itself. It is a matter 
or record that in 1890, when the manifesto was issued, there 
were 2,451 plural families; in nine years this number had been 
reduced to 1,543. Four years later the number was 897; and 
many of these have since passed away. 

In answer to the charge of disloyalty, founded upon al- 
leged secret obligations against our government, we declare to 
all men that there is nothing treasonable or disloyal in any or- 
dinance, ceremony, or ritual of the Church. 

The overthrow of earthly governments ; the union of 
church and state ; domination of the state by the church ; eccles- 
iastical interference with the political freedom and rights of the 
citizen, — all such things are contrary to the principles and policy 
of the Church, and directly at variance with the oft repeated 
declarations of its chief presiding authorities and of the 
Church itself, speaking through its general conferences. The 
doctrine of the Church on the subject of government, stands as 
follows : 

"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, 
rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustain- 
ing the law." 

Such is. our acknowledgment of dutv to civil governments. 
Again : 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require 
civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the 
same, and that such as will administer law in equity and 
justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of 
the people (if a republic), or the will of the sovereign." 

"We do not believe it just to mingle religious influ- 
ence with civil government, whereby one religious so- 
ciety is fostered and another proscribed in its spiritual 
privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citi- 
zens, denied." 

With reference to the laws of the Church, it is expressly 

said : 

"Be subject to the powers that be, until He reigns whose 
right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under His feet. 

"Behold, the laws which ye have received from my 
hand are the laws of the Church, and in this light ye shall 
hold them forth." 



14 



That is to say, no law or rule enacted, or revelation re- 
ceived by the Church, has been promulgated for the State. 
Such laws and revelations as have been given are solely 
for the government of the Church. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds to 
the doctrine of the separation of church and state; the non-in- 
terference of church authority in political matters ; and the ab- 
solute freedom and independence of the individual in the per- 
formance of his political duties. If, at any time, there has been 
conduct at variance with this doctrine, it has been in violation 
of the well settled principles and policy of the Church. 

We declare that from principle and policy, we favor : 

The absolute separation of church and state; 

No domination of the state by the church ; 

No church interference with the functions of the state; 

No state interference with the functions of the church, 
or with the free exercise of religion ; 

The absolute freedom of the individual from the dom- 
ination of ecclesiastical authority in political affairs; 

The equality of all churches before the law. 

The reaffirmation of this doctrine and policy, however, 
is predicated upon the express understanding that politics in 
the states where our people reside, shall be conducted as in 
other parts of the Union; that there shall be no interference 
by the State with the Church, nor with the free ex- 
ercise of religion. Should political parties make war upon 
the Church, or menace the civil, political, or religious 
rights of its members as such, — against a policy of that kind, 
by any political party or set of men whatsoever, we 
assert the inherent right of self-preservation for the Church, 
and her right and duty to call upon all her children, and upon 
all who love justice, and desire the perpetuation of religious lib- 
erty, to come to her aid, to stand with her until the danger shall 
have passed. And this, openly, submitting the justice of our 
cause to the enliehtened judgment of our fellow men, should 
such an issue unhappily arise. We desire to live in peace and 
confidence with our fellow citizens of all political parties and of 
all religions. 

It is sometimes urged that the permanent realization of 
such a desire is impossible, since the Latter-day Saints hold as a 
principle of their faith that God now reveals Himself to man, as 
in ancient times ; that the priesthood of the Church constitute 
a body of men who have, each for himself, in the sphere in 



15 



which he moves, special right to such revelation ; that the 
President of the Church is recognized as the only person 
through whom divine communication will come as law and 
doctrine to the religious body ; that such revelation may 
come at any time, upon any subject, spiritual or temporal, as 
God wills ; and finally that, in the mind of every faithful 
Latter-day Saint, such revelation, in whatsoever it counsels, 
advises or commands, is paramount. Furthermore it is some- 
times pointed out that the members of the Church are looking 
for the actual coming of a Kingdom of God on earth, that shall 
gather all the kingdoms of the world into one visible, divine 
empire, over which the risen Messiah shall reign. 

All this, it is held, renders it impossible for a "Mormon" 
to give true allegiance to his country, or to any earthly govern- 
ment. 

We refuse to be bound by the interpretations which 
others place upon our beliefs ; or by what they allege 
must be the practical consequences of our doctrines. Men have 
no right to impute to us what they think may be the logical de- 
duction from our beliefs, but which we ourselves do not accept. 
We are to be judged by our own interpretations, and by our ac- 
tions, not by the logic of others, as to what is, or may be, the 
result of our faith. We deny that either our belief in divine rev- 
elation, or our anticipation of the coming kingdom of God, 
weakens in any degree the genuineness of our allegiance to our 
country. When the divine empire will be established, we may not 
know any more than other Christians who pray, "Thy kingdom 
come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven;" but we do 
know that our allegiance and loyalty to country are strength- 
ened by the fact that while awaiting the advent of the Messiah's 
kingdom, we are under a commandment from God to be subject 
to the powers that be, until He comes "whose right it is to 
reign." 

"Mormonism" is in the world for the world's good. Teach- 
ing truth, inculcating morality, guarding the purity of the home, 
honoring authority and government, fostering education, and 
exalting man and woman, our religion denounces crime, and is 
a foe to tyranny in every form. "Mormonism" seeks to uplift, 
not to destrov society. She joins hands with the civilization of 
the aee. Proclaiming herself a special harbinger of the Savior's 
second coming, she recognizes in all the great epochs and move- 
ments of the past, steps in the march of progress leading up to 
the looked for millennial reign. "Mormonism" lifts an ensign of 



16 



peace to all people. The predestined fruits of her proposed sys- 
tem are the sanctification of the earth and the salvation of the 
human family. 

And now, to all the world : Having been commanded of 
God, as much as lieth in us, to live peaceably with all men — we, 
in order to be obedient to the heavenly commandment, send 
forth this Declaration, that our position upon the various ques- 
tions agitating the public mind concerning us may be known. 
We desire peace, and will do all in our power on fair and hon- 
orable principles to promote it. Our religion is interwoven 
with our lives, it has formed our character, and the truth of 
it: principles is impressed upon our souls. We submit to you, 
our fellow-men, that there is nothing in those principles that 
cells for execration, no matter how widely in some respects they 
may differ from your conceptions of religious truth. Certainly 
there is nothing in them that may not stand within the wide cir- 
cle of modern toleration of religious thought and practice. To 
us these principles are crystalizations of truth. They are as dear 
to us as your religious conceptions are to you. In their applica- 
tion to human conduct, we see the world's hope of redemption 
from sin and strife, from ignorance and unbelief. Our motives 
are not selfish; our purposes not petty and earth-bound; we 
contemplate the human race, past, present and yet to come, as 
immortal beings, for whose salvation it is our mission to labor ; 
and to this work, broad as eternity and deep as the love of God, 
we devote ourselves, now, and forever. Amen.

(Opening Address.) 

General prosperity in settlements of the 
Latt- r-day tSnlnts— Hefererjce to the ir Spir- 
itual Con ition— Organization of the Priest- 
hood and i hi ir duties— Rulir g object if 
the church the saltation of Mankind. 

I am happy in the privilege that I 
enjoy of being present at the opening of 
this, the seventy-fifth semi-annual 
conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I am 
pleased to see the number of brethren 
and sisters who are present. We realize 
the difficulty in the way of many of the 
people attending conference on a week- 
day like this, as they are compelled to 
labor; business is in full operation, not 
only in this city and county, but in eve- 
ry other part of the country, and many 
are busy attending to secular duties, 
which makes it difficult for them to 
leave their homes to attend conference 
on the week days. 

It is gratifying, however, to see the 
number who are here today at the open- 
ing meeting of our conference, and I 
congratulate you, my brethren and sis- ' 
ters, upon being present, and upon the 
blessings, both temporal and spiritual, 
that have been poured out upon the 
people since our last conference. Taken 
as a whole, the season has been a pros- 
perous one throughout the land, though 
some localities have suffered more or

less. The forepart of our season was 
seriously injured by drouth, and many 
people in the southern part of this state 
and in Arizona, New Mexico, and in 
old Mexico especially, as also in our 
colonies in Canada, have suffered seri- 
ously because of the protracted drouth 
that has been upon the land. But the 
prospect is that the long continued spell 
of drouth has been broken by copious 
rains that have descended upon the 
land, making the fields and the plains 
and the mountains luxuriant with the 
growth of herbs and grasses for the 
sustenance of the flocks and herds of 
the people, and also for the supply of 
abundant water for irrigation purposes 
on their farms. Taking a retrospect of 
the whole condition, throughout the 
length and breadth of the land, we feel 
that it is favorable and that the bless- 
ings of the Lord and His merciful hand 
over all the interests of the people have 
been visible, and we know that we are 
indebted greatly to His mercy and kind- 
ness for the favors and blessings that 
have been bestowed upon us. 

1 trust that the spiritual condition 
of the Latter-day Saints has continued 
to be as good as the temporal condi- 
tions have been, and that we are pro- 
gressing and growing in the knowledge 
of the truth and in faithfulness before 
the Lord in keeping His commandments 
and His laws as much as He has pros- 
pered us temporally; for after all the 
great desideratum is the faithfulness of 
the people to the covenants that they 
have made with the Lord and with each 
other in righteousness. 

Reflec ting over the condition of the 
Church at the present time, since I have 
been sitting here, I have jotted down a 
few Utile items that I wish to refer to 
briefly. T find that we have now in the 
United States, Canada and Mexico 55 
organized stakes of Zion. As a matter 
•of course, therefore, there are 55 pre- 
siding officers over these various stakes, 
and 110 counselors to the presidents of 
stakes. In each of these stakes, is an 
organized High Council, consisting of 
12 High Priests which aggregates 660 
High Councilors in the Church today 
as it is organized, who possess the au- 



thority of the Holy Priesthood to min- 
ister for the salvation of the souls of 
men, and who sit as judges, with the 
presidents of stakes and their counsel- 
ors, in all the affairs of the Church, and 
who are called upon and are expected 
to be exemplars before the people, set- 
ting before them examples that are 
worthy of imitation and of emulation 
— fathers indeed to the people and judg- 
es of righteousness in their midst. 
This, of course, constitutes quite an 
army of official workers — men who are 
expected to be instant in season and 
out of season: men upon whom rests 
great responsibility; wise counselors, 
assisting the presidencies of the various 
stakes to regulate the affairs of their 
churches and to set in order the houses 
of the Saints and the stake organiza- 
tions throughout the Church. 

In connection with the 55 organized 
stakes of Zion we have in the neigh- 
borhood of 20 different organized mis- 
sions throughout the world, presided 
over by presidents and counselors, and 
these missions are supplied with El- 
ders and Seventies that are sent out to 
preach the Gospel, numbering at the 
present time in the neighborhood of 
1,500 Elders. Of course these Elders 
are not only traveling throughout the 
United States, but throughout Europe, 
in the islands of the sea and in New 
Zealand and Australia; also in the 
Holy Land, where nve have an organ- 
ized mission and Elders are there 
preaching the Gospel to those people. 

I am informed also that we have 
626 'organized wards. Of course, these 
organizations vary from time to time; 
that is, they frequently increase, and 
occasionally a ward is disorganized, be- 
ing joined with another ward, making 
two into one. Over these wards there 
are 626 Bishops presiding, and 1,252 
Bishops' counselors, who are a mighty- 
power in the midst of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 
officers of these organizations are the 
officers of the Church who come in Im- 
mediate contact with the people and 
who are in direct intercourse "with 
them. It is expected that the Bishop 
of a ward with his counselors will un-

•derstand the necessities of every mem- 
ber of his ward. Then they have as as- 
sistants and helpers a large corps of El- 
ders, and Priests, Teachers and Dea- 
cons of the Lesser Priesthood, who ren- 
der assistance to them in the temporal 
as well as the spiritual affairs of the 
Church. It devolves upon the Bishopric 
of the ward to look after the poor, to 
minister unto the sick and the afflicted 
and to see that there is no want nor 
suffering among the people in these or- 
ganized divisions of the Church. It is 
also the duty of these presiding officers 
in the Church to look after the spiritual 
welfare of the people, to see that they 
are living moral, pure and upright lives, 
that they are faithful in the discharge 
of their duties as Latter-day Saints, 
that they are honest in their dealings 
with one another, and with all the 
world. It is their business to see that 
spiritual light exists in their hearts, 
and that the people under their presi- 
dency and direction are living the lives 
of Saints, as far as it is possible for 
men and women, in the mortal body, 
beset by the weaknesses and imperfec- 
tions of mankind, can be Saints. Great 
responsibility rests upon these, and we 
have at work in the Church, in this 
relation, a vast corps of efficient men 
who are laboring diligently for the wel- 
fare of mankind. And all these labor 
without salaries. They are not paid 
officers. It is true that they receive as- 
sistance from time to time, as they may 
need, in a small way, but not one ob- 
tains what the world would esteem as 
a salary, nor can they be called paid 
officers of the Church. 

We have also in the Church today, I 
am Informed, 146 quorums of Seventy. 
These constitute a body of Elders of 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 
men, whose special duty it is to respond 
to the call of the Apostles to preach 
the Gospel, without purse or scrip, to 
all the nations of the earth. They are 
minute men. It is expected that they 
will be ready, whenever they are called, 
to go out in the world, or to go out to 
the various organizations of the Church 
to fulfill missions and to perform such 
duties as shall be required of them, in 
order that the work of the Lord and the 



work of the ministry may be upheld 
and sustained and carried on in the 
Church and throughout the world. 
These councils or quorums of Seventy 
are not alway full, a full council being 
70 Elders. But there are approximate- 
ly 10,000 Elders who now hold that posi- 
tion in the Church. They are called to 
an apostolic calling. They are required 
to be special witnesses of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. It is expected of this body 
of men that they will have burning In 
their souls the testimony of Jesus 
Christ, which is the spirit of prophecy; 
that they will be full of light and of the 
knowledge of the truth; that they will 
be enthusiastic in their calling, and in 
the cause of Zion, and that they will 
be ready at any moment, when re- 
quired, to go out into the world, op 
anywhere throughout the Church and 
bear testimony of the truth, preach 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and set ex- 
amples before the world of purity, love, 
honesty, uprightness and integrity to 
the truth. 

In addition to these organizations 
we have in each stake of Zion an or- 
ganization called the High Priests' 
quorum, to which all High Priests of 
the Church belong, including the pres- 
idency and high councilors of the stake, 
and also the Bishops and their counsel- 
ors, all the Patriarchs and all others 
who have been ordained to the office of 
High Priest in the Church, which office 
is the office of presidency in the Mel- 
chisedek Priesthood, not that every 
man who holds the office of High Priest 
is a president. Only he who is called, 
appointed and set apart to preside 
among the High Priests holds the pre- 
siding authority and office. But it is 
the duty of these quorums of High 
Priests to act in their calling; not to 
sit idly down and be indifferent to the 
interests of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, nor indifferent to 
the saving of the souls of men. It is ex- 
pected that this quorum of Priesthood 
in the various stakes of Zion will look 
after all the interests of the stake; that 
is. that they will look after the moral 
condition of the people; that they will 
teach righteousness; that they will see 
that those who are acting in presiding

authority in the stakes of Zion, are up- 
right, honest, pure and humble men, 
and fit for the positions in which they 
are called to act. Thus this council of 
the Priesthood constitutes a council of 
power and influence in the Church. 

"Then we have the Elders' organiza- 
tions. A council or quorum of Elders 
is composed of 96 Elders. There may be 
a number of councils or quorums of El- 
ders in each stake. I am not prepared 
to state how many Elders we have in 
the Church; but they are very numer- 
ous. It is the duty of this body of men 
to be standing ministers at home; to 
be ready at the call of the presiding of- 
ficers of the Church and the stakes, to 
labor in the ministry at home, and to 
officiate in any calling that may be re- 
quired of them, whether it be to work 
in the temples, or to labor in the minis- 
try at home, or whether it be to go out 
into the world, along with the Seven- 
ties, to preach the Gospel to the world. 

"We have a number of Patriarchs in 
the Church, whose duty it is to bestow 
blessings upon the heads of those who 
seek blessings at their hands. They are 
fathers. They hold the evangelical of- 
fice in the Church. It is their business 
and right to bestow blessings upon the 
people, to make promises unto them in 
the name of the Lord, as it may be giv- 
en them by the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit, to comfort them in the hours of 
sorrow and trouble, to strengthen their 
faith by the promises that shall be 
made to them through the Spirit of Goil, 
and to be fathers indeed of the people, 
leading them into all truth. 

"Then we have the Lesser Priesthood, 
which attends to the different tempo- 
ral matters of the Church, consisting 
of Priests, Teachers and Deacons, who 
labor under the direction of the Bishop- 
ric in the various wards in which they 
dwell, for the work of the ministry, for 
the edifying of the body of Christ, the 
unifying of the people and bringing 
them up to the standard of righteous- 
ness that they should reach in the flesh, 
according to the light they possess and 
the ability and talent which the Lord 
has given them. 

"This, my brethren and sisters, is a 



very brief outline of the organization 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. It has been organized 
by the wisdom of the Almighty, and 
not by the wisdom of man. It has been 
organized to accomplish the purposes 
that the Lord has in view to be accom- 
plished by it. The people are organized 
that they may be taught righteousness; 
that they may be faithful before the 
Lord in keeping the covenants that 
they have made with Him in righteous- 
ness. Among these covenants are that 
they will cease from sin and from all 
unrighteousness; that they will work 
righteousness in their lives; that they 
will abstain from the use of intoxicants, 
from the use of strong drinks of every 
description, from the use of tobacco, 
from every vile thing, and from ex- 
tremes in every phase of life; that they 
will not take the name of God in vain: 
that they will not bear false witness 
against their neighbor; that they will 
seek to love their neighbors as them- 
selves; to carry out the golden rule of 
the Lord. 'Do unto others as they would 
that others should do unto them.' These 
principles are involved in the covenants 
that the people have made in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and it is expected that these 
officers and presiding authorities in the 
Church, whom I have cursorily named, 
shall see to it that the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints will keep these covenants that 
they have made with the Lord, ami that 
they will observe these principles and 
adapt them to their lives and carry 
them out, that they may be indeed the 
salt of the earth; not salt that has lost 
its savor and is good for nothing but to 
be cast out and trodden under the foot 
of men, but salt that has its savor and 
that is wholesome: that the people of 
God may be a light unto this genera- 
tion and unto the world; that men may 
see your good works and glorify 
your Father which is in heaven; and 
that notwithstanding enemies, who are 
filled with the spirit of persecution, and 
who say all manner of false things 
against the Latter-day Saints, those 
who have entered into the covenant of 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

the Gospel will keep the command- 
ments of the Lord, will obey the dic- 
tates of the Spirit of the Lord unto 
them, will work righteousness in the 
earth, and will go right on in the path 
that Almighty God has marked out for 
them to pursue, fulfilling and accom- 
plishing His will and His purposes con- 
cerning them in the latter day. It does 
not make any difference to us what the 
world says about us, we know what 
■our mission is, and we propose to fulfill 
that mission by the help of Almighty 
God, and that mission is to save men 
from the errors of the world, from 
darkness, from unbelief in the true and 
living God and in the redeeming sacri- 
fice of the Lord Jesus Christ, that men 
may not fall into infidelity, that they 
may not abandon the truth nor the 
paths of righteousness God has marked 
out for them to walk in. That is our 
mission. It is to save men from error, 
from wickedness and from apostatizing 
from truth and righteousness, and that 
men might believe in the true and liv- 
ing God, and in Jesus Christ whom he 
has sent into the world, whom to know 
is life eternal. Our mission is to save 
men from the powers of darkness and 
from the snares and pitfalls of Satan 
wherein thev are tempted from paths 
of truth to commit sin, and bring deg- 
radation, sorrow and shame upon 
themselves by transgressing the laws 
of God and the laws of life. 

"We are not ashamed of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, which we have re- 
ceived; for we know that it is the pow- 
er of God unto salvation unto all that 
believe and receive it in their hearts 
and live it according to the will and 
purpose of God. Now, my brethren 
and sisters, I rejoice in these principles. 
I praise God with all my soul that He 
has restored the Priesthood. And 
what is the Priesthood? It is nothing 
more nor less than the power of God 
delegated to man by which man can 
act in the earth for the salvation of the 
human family, in the name of the 
Father and the Son and the Holy 
Ghost, and act legitimately; not as- 
suming that authority, not borrowing 



it from generations that are dead and 
gone, but authoritv that has been given 
in this day in which we live by minis- 
tering angels and spirits from above, 
direct from the presence of Almighty 
God, who have come to the earth in our 
day and restored the Priesthood to the 
children of men, by which they may 
baptize for the remission of sins and 
lay on hands for the reception of the 
Holy Ghost, and by which they can re- 
mit sin, with the sanction and blessing 
of Almighty God. It is the same power 
and Priesthood that was committed to 
the disciples of Christ while He was 
upon the earth; that whatsoever they 
should bind on earth should be bound 
in heaven, and whatsoever they should 
loose on earth should be loosed in 
heaven, and whomsoever they should 
bless should be blessed, and if they 
cursed, in the spirit of righteousness 
and meekness before God, God would 
confirm that curse. But men are not 
called upon to curse mankind; that is 
not our mission; it is our mission to 
preach righteousness to them. It is our 
business to love and to bless men, and 
to redeem them from the fall and from 
the wickedness of the world. This is 
our mission and our special calling. 
God will curse and will exercise His 
judgment in those matters. Vengeance 
is mine, saith the Lord, and I will re- 
pay. We are perfectly willing to leave 
vengeance in the hands of God and let 
Him judge between us and our enemies 
and let Him reward them according to 
His own wisdom and mercy. 

"Now, may the Lord bless us through- 
out this conference. I can feel that I 
am doing injury to my voice in contin- 
uing to speak. I have been suffering 
for the past two or three weeks with a 
very severe cold, which has greatly af- 
fected my voice, and I am only just re- 
covering from it. But I am pleased 
that I have had the privilege of speak- 
ing a few words to you at the opening 
of this conference. I pray God to bless 
the people that shall come here, and 
pour out His spirit upon them, to make 
their hearts warm up and burn with 
affection toward Him for His abundant

mercies unto them, and with love for 
one another and for all mankind: for it 
is our mission to save the world from 
sin and darkness and to lead all to a 
knowledge of God and His truth. 

May the Lord help us to consummate 
the mission He has given unto us, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

The Mountain of the Lord's house. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

Object of Missionary Work— Those \vh labor 
in it niieting With success— liedeuiptiou of 
the Dead. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
thankful to my Heavenly Father that 
He has spared my life to assemble once 
more with you in conference. I hav<" 
listened with a great deal of pleasure 
to the remarks that have been made 
by President Smith. What a vast body 
of men there is in this Church! and 
what is their object in life? I under- 
stand it to be the salvation of the hu- 
man family. While President Smith was 
speaking, I looked around here and I 
saw a large number of presidents of 
missions. Our Elders go out into the 
world, leaving their homes and families, 
and travel without purse or scrip, and 
their object is to bring salvation to the 
honest in heart. These presidents of 
missions send the Elders from house to 
house, bearing the message of salvation 
and the printed word to all who will 
receive it. In reflecting upon this, I 
thought how strange it is that these 
missionaries, going forth as they do 
with the message of peace, offering the 
people a book or a tract containing the 
word of God, should be treated in the 
way they are. Sometimes the doors are 
closed in their faces, and the people 
curtly tell them that they will not 
receive their books or tracts; and in 
many cases the Elders are treated with 
contempt, though this is not always the 
case. Supposing the minister of any 
denomination was to present himself 
at my house and respectfully offer me 
a book setting forth his religious views. 
I was wondering if I would slam the 
door in his face and treat him with 



contempt. No. I would at least be re- 
spectful and say that I did not wish to 
receive it. You, my brethren, who are 
abroad in the world, know that you 
have to meet these conditions; but your 
object is. as we all know, to promote 
peace and salvation wherever you go. 
That is your mission, and I rejoice to 
know that you are very successful in 
thai mission, and that many are receiv- 
ing your message and obeying the Gos- 
pel. 

We rejoice that the work of the Lord 
is growing and increasing, and we testi- 
fy that its mission will be prospered 
in the earth. This is the work of the 
Lord. He is at the helm, and He will 
certainly take care of it. It is our duty, 
of course, to do the very best we can, 
and as the President has said, we 
should so order our lives as to be above 
reproach. We should not only preach 
the Gospel by precept, but we should 
do so by our acts. Seeing that we are 
devoting our lives to this cause, let our 
lives be such that all men who come in 
contact with us may see our good 
works. 

In addition to all that has been done 
in the missionary fields, there are other 
places where the great work of salvation 
is being carried on. Thousands and tens 
of thousands are being added to the 
Church annually in the temples of the 
Lord. Those who', during their life- 
time, did not have the opportunity that 
we have had of receiving the Gospel, 
are now receiving the benefits of sal- 
vation. This work is growing and mul- 
tiplying in the temples, as well as the 
work abroad. The object of those who 
work in the temples is also to brins 
salvation to the fullest extent, both to 
the living and the dead. Notwithstand- 
ing all that may be said in relation to 
the work in the temple, you know, my 
brethren and sisters, that when you go 
to the house of the Lord and receive the 
ordinances there administered, they are 
all calculated to make you better men 
and women, better fathers and moth- 
ers; and everything that is done In 
those houses is for salvation. The tes- 
timony of all who go there is that it 
makes them feel better prepared to bat-

tie with life. They become better 
fathers and mothers, and better citi- 
zens of the United States or of any 
other country. I can testify to this, 
and thousands that are before me, who 
have been through the house of the 
Lord could bear me out in this testi- 
mony, if called upon. There is noth- 
ing done there in any manner that has 
a tendency in the least to harm any 
individual, but everything that is done 
is for the best good and salvation of 
the people. 

I rejoice in these things, my brethren 
and sisters. I am thankful to the Lord 
that He has given me a testimony of 
the truth of this Gospel. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and 
that he laid the foundation for this 
great work. He it was that laid the 
foundation of all these organizations 
that we have heard about this morning, 
and this work will increase and multi- 
ply upon the earth. May the Lord 
help us all to be faithful and true al- 
ways to the covenants that we have 
made with the Lord, that we may keep 
them faithfully and never do anything 
that would bring His displeasure upon 
us. God grant it to all of us. Again 
I express my thanks and praise the 
name of my Heavenly Father for His 
continued mercies and goodness unto 
me, and for extending my life until I am 
now nearly eighty-three years of age. 
I thank the Lord for all these blessings, 
and dedicate myself unto Him with a 
determination to serve Him as long as 
I live upon the earth. I ask Him for 
His blessing upon you all, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT. ANTHON H. LUND. 

The Char«c1er and Extent of the Priesthood 
—Beneficial Results of Fast Offer! gs— 
Uns- ltishness of M sslonaries to the World 
— Intellectual aud Religious development 
of the Children. 

While our President was addressing 
us these words came into my mind: 

"But ye are a chosen generation, a 
royal Priesthood, an holy nation, a pe- 
culiar people; that ye should shew forth 
the praises of Him who hath called you 
out of darkness into His marvelous 
light." 



It occurred to me that the Apostle Pe- 
ter, in addressing the Saints formerly, 
looked upon a people who were simi- 
larly organized to the Latter-day 
Saints, and he called them "a chosen 
generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy 
nation." Those who contemplate the 
organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints will be 
struck with the number who hold the 
Priesthood. The Priesthood is conferred 
upon all male members who are worthy 
to receive it. This is a great blessing 
which the members of this Church en<- 
joy, and it makes them a peculiar peo- 
ple, a chosen generation, holding the 
royal Priesthood. There is no priest- 
ly caste in our Church. Contrary to 
the opinion of many, such a thing does 
not exist with us, unless you will call 
the whole Church a priestly caste, be- 
cause all participate in the blessing* 
pertaining to the Priesthood. 

There are in the Church two Priest- 
hoods — the Aaronic and the Melchise- 
dek. The Aaronic Priesthood is the les- 
ser, an appendage to the higher. It 
embraces the offices of Deacons, 
Teachers and Priests. Those 'who hold 
these offices are called to labor amongst 
the people, to teach them, to serve 
them, to watch over them, and to see 
that there is no hardness of heart or 
ill feelings among them. We call our 
young men very early in .life to bear 
the Priesthood. When they are 12 or IS 
years old we ordain them Deacons or 
Teachers, if they are worthy. We givw 
them something to do in the Lord's 
house. We call upon them to look after 
the meeting-houses and to visit the 
Saints. In some places Deacons look 
after the widows, and see that they are 
furnished with fuel, and attend to the 
chopping of wood for them. Being 
called to the Priesthood, they feel that 
these services are honorary ones. They 
are called on also to collect fast-day 
offerings from the people, many ot 
whom may not have ready money to 
give unto the poor. If they have not 
the cash they give provisions and other 
things which they can spare, and which 
the poor need. In many stakes the 
Deacons are called upon to perform 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



such duties as these, and this gives 
them in their youth a love for doing 
good and for helping the poor. 

Here let me say, in this connection, 
that in our Church a custom prevails 
Which I consider a beautiful one. It is 
this: The Saints are called upon to 
remember the poor when they fast. 
They show their reverence for the Lord 
In fasting, and fit themselves better to 
approach Him in prayer, showing that 
they can overcome the strong wants of 
nature by abstaining from food for one, 
two, or three meals. Our fast-day 
comes on the first Sunday in each 
month; and while the members of the 
Church deny themselves on that day, 
they are asked to remember the poor, 
and to give unto them at least the val- 
ue of the meals that they refrain from 
taking. If this be done conscientious- 
ly throughout the Church there is no 
need of any of the poor suffering. We 
have not a great amount of poor any- 
how in our midst outside of the popu- 
lous centers. In some of the stakes 
they have none that need support. The 
people may not be well-to-do, they may 
not have much of this world's goods, 
but they are sufficiently blessed not to 
need any support from others. In Salt 
Lake and the larger cities, where so 
many people gather and have to de- 
pend on day's labor, we have quite a 
number to support. Now, I would ad- 
monish the Saints living in stakes 
•where they are not called upon to do 
much towards supporting the poor, that 
they do not slacken their efforts to col- 
lect fast-day donations or to contribute 
them, for it is a duty laid upon all the 
members of the Church to remember 
the poor. The Lord delights in those 
who remember the poor. And so the 
beautiful custom has been instituted 
In our midst of imparting of our sub- 
stance to the poor, to make the poor 
glad, on the day that has been set 
apart as a day of fasting and praye*-. 
One of the old Church fathers writes 
that in early days it was the custom 
among the Christians when they fasted 
that they took the money they would 
have had to expend for the meals which 
they did not partake, of, and gave It 



unto the poor. This same custom has 
been revived in our Church. I do not 
suppose, however, that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith ever read anything of 
this kind, but he was inspired to in- 
stitute it in our midst. In looking over 
what the Saints have done in regard 
to fast-day donations, I think there 
is great need of improvement, and 
that all should be more consciencious 
in observing the fast-days and remem- 
bering the poor. When we do this to 
honor the Lord and to keep His com- 
mandments, we have a claim upon His 
blessings and He will not forget us. 

As a general thing, the Saints respond 
cheerfully to all the calls that 
are made upon them; and in look- 
ing back upon our history, one cannot 
help seeing that they have been called 
upon to make many sacrifices. But 
take the men in our midst who have 
made the greatest sacrifices, and you 
will generally find the men who have 
been the most greatly blessed. From 
the beginning of the Church the Lord 
has called upon His people to do some- 
thing. 

Our religion is one in which we are 
called upon to show our faith by our 
works. The Latter-day Saints have 
shown their faith this way. When they 
are called upon to go out amongst the 
nations to preach the gospel, they do 
not ask how much their pay will be. 
but they at once commence to regulate 
their affairs so that they can betake 
themselves to their mission-field and 
perform the labor required, without 
any remuneration. They feel that they 
owe the duty to the world, to warn 
them of what is coming, to tell them 
the glorious message "that God Him- 
self has revealed in our day, and to 
declare unto men that there is an op- 
portunity to enjoy the blessings of the 
Gospel today as they were enjoyed 
formerly. Therefore, when they are 
called upon to go out into the world 
they almost invariably answer that 
they will be ready to go at the time ap- 
pointed. Thus our missionaries go to 
the different parts of the earth, and 
you will find them in Europe, in Asia, 
in Africa, in Australia and New Zea-

land, in the islands of the sea, and on 
this great continent of ours. Wherever 
the call is, they go, trusting in the 
Lord to sustain them, and to give them 
power to perform their mission. Though 
they have not studied philosophy and 
are not learned in the systems of men. 
they go feeling and knowing that they 
have the truth, and they are desirous 
to make every man acquainted with 
what they have received. This they 
do not do by being coerced or forced, 
but by their own free will; and when 
they return from their missions (which 
generally last from two to four years 
or more) they are ready to report that 
the time spent in their missionary 
fields has been the happiest period of 
their lives. When their work is com- 
pleted they love to return to their 
homes, because they love their families 
and relations. They do not go on mis- 
sions because they like to be away 
from home, or because they love to 
ramble around the world, but they go 
because there is no joy so great as 
that experienced in devoting oneself 
entirely to the cause of Christ. And 
how happy they are to find those who 
will listen to their words and receive 
them with honest hearts! They feel 
then that the Lord is reward- 
ing them for their labors and 
for the sacrifice they have 
made in leaving home and loved 
ones. The preposterous idea has been 
set forth by our enemies that our El- 
ders are paid so much for every con- 
vert they make. How ridiculous this 
sounds to us here! Nearly every man 
in our midst has been away upon a 
mission. He knows what he has re- 
ceived — or rather what he has not re- 
ceived. He has gone with means which 
he has labored for with his own hands, 
and has spent the same for the up- 
building of the kingdom of God, and all 
the pay he expects to receive is the in- 
ner conviction of having done his duty 
and filled the call which the Lord has 
made upon him. He knows that the 
promises are unto such as are willing 
to keep the commandementa of the 
Lord and labor for His cause. 
I stated that our young men early 



receive the Priesthood. Some are or- 
dained Teachers and Priests and as 
such go among the families of the 
Saints to labor in their calling. They 
are generally accompaniedi by an older 
person. The families gather around 
ready to listen to the teachings of these 
bearers of the Priesthood, and the time 
they spend in the homes of the Saints 
is devoted to talk upon the topics per- 
taining to the kingdom of God and to 
the duties of the members of the 
Church. 

Besides the Aaronic Priesthood, we 
have in our Church the Melchisedek 
Priesthood. An Elder holds this Priest- 
hood. A Seventy, a High Priest, an 
Apostle, the President of the Church, 
all hold the same Priesthood. There 
are only the two Priesthoods, 
but there are different offices 
in the same Priesthood. You 
heard our President speak this 
morning concerning the organization 
of the Church, stakes and wards, and 
about presidents of stakes and Bishops 
of wards. All these men holding the 
Priesthood, have been placed in charge 
of the flock of Christ, and they are 
watching over them. As a general 
thing, they spend all the time they 
can spare ministering for the good of 
the people. In most cases they are 
men of business and under the neces- 
sity of providing for their own famil- 
ies, but they take what time they can to 
look after those the Lord has put in 
their charge. 

Such are the Priesthoods, and such 
the offices therein. Then we have the 
auxiliary organizations in the Church. 
They are not exactly parts of the 
Priesthood, but auxiliary thereunto. 
They are helps in government. We 
commence with the little children in the 
Primary association. We call upon good 
sisters in our midst to take these in 
hand, and once a week they meet with 
our little children and teach them con- 
cerning right and wrong, and concern- 
ing the crucified Savior; they inspire 
their young hearts with a love of God. 
and teach them to sing praises unto 
Him. This organization takes 
in the smallest of our chil- 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dren. Then when they get 
to be about 14 years of age they join 
the Mutual Improvement association. 
There they meet once a »week and take 
a course in theology and other neces- 
sary branches. The aim of this organ- 
ization is to build up the young peo- 
ple, to warn them of the pitfalls in the 
way of the youth, to strengthen them in 
their resolve to serve God, and to teach 
them the principles of the Gospel, that 
they may have a foundation for their 
faith. After this the young men join 
the quorums of the Priesthood, and the 
young women join the Relief societies, 
which were established by the Prophet 
Joseph for the good of the people. The 
sisters of the Relief society do a good 
work in our midst. We have the so- 
cieties organized in every ward in Zion 
and in the branches abroad. They gath- 
means for the poor and they look after 
the sick. In many cases 3 r ou will find 
the sisters watching night and day at 
the sick bed. Indeed they are, as the 
name of the society indicates, persons 
of another organization not an auxili- 
ary organizations in the Church. 

Before I conclude, I want to speak 
of another organization not an auxili- 
ary organization of the Priesthood, but 
an organization pertaining to the 
Church school system, I mean the re- 
ligion classes, which we are trying to 
establish in our midst. This meets op- 
position, both from without and, I am 
sorry to say, from within. The object 
of these classes is to teach our chil- 
dren what they cannot be taught in the 
district schools, namely, the principles 
of the Gospel. We do not want in any 
way to interfere with the rights of oui 
fellow citizens who do not belong to oui 
Church. We do not want to force any 
of this religion class work upon their 
children. We do believe, however, that 
an education without a God is a faulty 
one. We do believe that children 
should be taught morality and faith in 
God. But as the laws of the land are, 
this cannot be done in our district 
schools. We must keep the public 
schools free from all theological doc- 
trines. No one need to fear this move- 
ment of ours. It is not intended for 



propaganda amongst those who are not 
of us. But 'we claim the right to teach 
our own children what we want them 
taught. We believe that there is a- 
great necessity of teaching them mor- 
ality, principles of sound conduct, faith 
in God, and doctrines of salvation. The 
children may be taught the secular 
branches by the most polished teachers, 
but if they are not taught morality and 
faith their education will be deficient 
and they will not know how to reach 
the object for which they have corns 
upon the earth. We like our children 
to receive a good education and to be- 
come mentally strong, and we encour- 
age all the Latter-day Saints to take- 
advantage of the district schools, of 
the high schools and the universities for 
the branches that are taught there, but 
we do feel that our children need more 
than they can get in those institutions, 
and for that reason we have estab- 
lished religion classes. Now. we have 
no objections to our friends of other 
denominations establishing classes and 
teaching their children the principle* 
that they believe in. Our Cathollo 
friends set us a good example in this re- 
spect. They will not let their children 
be neglected in religious instruction. 
We do not object to others teaching 
their children so long as they do not 
teach our children what we do not want 
them taught. We want our children 
to receive the kind of instruction that 
we know to be all-important to them. 
This is all there is to the religion class- 
es. We are not attempting to mix 
church and state; we do not want to 
intrude our religion into the state 
schools; but *we do claim the right to 
have our own children taught in the 
principles that we believe; and for this 
purpose we gather them together. In 
places where there are but few, if any, 
non-"Mormons" we may hire the 
schoolhouse after the school has been 
dismissed; but we particularly urge 
those in charge of the religion classes 
not to interfere with the children of 
non-"Mormons." I want to say to the 
Latter-day Saints, do not underesti- 
mate the importance of having your 
children taught the principles of the 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNON. 



11 



Gospel in early life. We have church 
schools established, but as a general 
thing- the children do not go there until 
they are out of the grades. Now, from 
seven to fourteen years of age is the 
time when the child's mind is plastic, 
and when you can make lasting impres- 
sions upon it. We do not want that 
time to go by without our doing some- 
thing for the spiritual growth of the 
child; we want to teach our young 
children faith in Christ, and have them 
well grounded in His doctrines. I see it 
is time to dismiss the meeting. May 
the Lord bless you all, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER DAVID H. CANNON, 
(President of St. George Temple) 

I feel honored this afternoon in hav- 
ing the opportunity of appearing before 
this vast assembly to represent the 
labors performed in the first temple 
erected in Utah — the St. George Temple. 
The labor commenced in the St. George 
Temple on the ninth day of January, 
1877, under the direction of our late 
beloved president, Brigham Young. 
President Wilford Woodruff was ap- 
pointed at that time to preside over 
the temple. For the first few years 
the work performed in that house of the 
Lord was very great, many people 
flocking from the northern settlements 
to attend to the labor necessary for 
the redemption of their dead kindred; 
but as the temples in other parts of 
the country were finished, the work in 
the St. George Temple very materially 
decreased, until we had very few in at- 



tendance, so few in fact that at one 
time it was thought proper to close 
the house in consequence of the small 
amount of ordinance work that was be- 
ing performed. This was in the time 
of President Woodruff's presidency over 
the Church. When it was mooted, 
President Woodruff made the remark to 
us that he expected to keep the temple 
open so that the paople might have 
the opportunity of entering its sacred 
precincts and laboring for the redemp- 
tion of their kindred dead, and if they 
failed to avail themselves of the op- 
portunity then the responsibility should 
be upon the people and not upon him; 
for it was the Lord that nad estab- 
lished the work with which we are 
identified, and he was satisfied that it 
would triumph. The work in the St. 
George Temple has been increasing 
for the last few months, and I believe 
there is an awakening among the peo- 
ple in regard to this great duty. Not- 
withstanding the fact that Elijah did 
come, in fulfillment of the prediction 
of Malachi, wherein he said that before 
the great and dreadful day of the Lord 
Elijah should come and turn the 
hearts of the fathers to the children and 
the hearts of the children to the fath- 
ers, lest the earth be smitten with a 
curse — I say, notwithstanding the fact 
that Elijah has come, and to a very 
great degree the hearts of the fathers 
have been turned to the children and 
the hearts of the children to the fath- 
ers, as manifested in the many genea- 
logical societies that have been estab- 
lished in the earth since that time, be 
it known unto you, my brethren and 
sisters, that before the appearance of 
Elijah in the Kirtland Temple there 
were very few societies of that char- 
acter and very little genealogical data 
that had been compiled in form in order 
to be made available for the Latter-day 
Saints; but since that time men have 
been moved upon, without knowing 
what power it was, to spend means in 
collecting genealogical records and 
publishing them to the world, and the 
Latter-day Saints have been able to 
avail themselves of the information 
thus afforded. The work of the Lord 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is increasing, and as it increases tem- 
ple work will increase also. 

I want to bear my testimony to you 
that this is the work of God with which 
we have become identified, and it is 
desfined to accomplish all that is 
claimed for it. It will roll forth, gath- 
ering- strength upon the right hand and 
upon the left, until every power that 
is opposed to it is brought into full 
subjection to the mind and will of our 
Heavenly Father, and until He will 
reign upon th^ earth whose right it is 
to reign — our beloved elder brother, 
Jesus Christ. I rejoice in this work. 
It has become a part* of my very na- 
ture. I know it is true. I have 
watched its progress from my earliest 
recollection. I was with the people as 
a boy when th?y were driven from 
Illinois, and I have been with them 
from that time to this. The knowledge 
of the work of God has increased in my 
heart just as daylight increases when 
the morning dawns upon the earth until 
the earth is bathed in the refulgence of 
light. There have been times when the 
clouds have been lowering, and, to look 
at things from a natural standpoint, 
it seemed as if the people of God 
would be annihilated; but the power of 
the Almighty has been manifest and 
they have been delivered. I am just as 
satisfied that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of God as I am that I am 
standing here before you, and also that 
President Brigham Young was his suc- 
cessor; that President John Taylor, as 
the third President of the Church, was 
'a prophet of God, inspired to accomplish 
what he did; that Wilford Woodruff 
in his turn was clothed upon with the 
power of Almighty God and was a 
prophet in the midst of the people; 
that Lorenzo Snow had prophetic pow- 
ers, and, as the President of the Church, 
held the keys of authority upon the 
earth in his time, and his testimony to 
the people was the word of God; and 
our present leader, Joseph F. Smith, is 
a prophet of God. I bear this testimony 
to you in all solemnity. I testify that 
this work is destined to triumph and to 
roll forth until it fills the whole earth. 
May the blessings of God attend us in 



the future meetings of the conference 
that we may have a time of rejoicing 
while together. I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL ROSKELLEY, 
(Of the Logan Temple.) 
I take pleasure, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in representing the second temple 
dedicated to the service of God in this 
inter-mountain region. The Logan Tem- 
ple was opened in 18S4, and since that 
time thousands upon thousands of the 
Latter-day Saints have entered its sa- 
cred precincts, receiving blessings at 
the hands of the servants and hand- 
maidens of God laboring there. The 
spirit of Elijah has rested upon the la- 
bors of God's servants and hand- 
maidens, so much that thousands 
have received blessings at their hands. 
Their hearts have been made to rejoice 
in the holy one of Israel, and they have 
gone from the house of the Lord feel- 
ing that God's presence is resting upon 
the Temples that have been erected for 
the administration of ordinances per- 
taining to the salvation of the living 
and the redemption of the dead. The 
Saints have been made glad to know 
that the welding link between parents 
and children and husbands and wiv^c 
has been made manifest in these latter 
days through the revelations of God to 
His servant, the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and to his legal successors. The labor 
in the Logan Temple has been continu- 
ous since its dedication. We have re- 
joiced that the Spirit of the Lord has 
been with us in the work. We have 
been delighted with the visits of the 
Presidency of the Church and of the 
Apostles who have come to us from 
time to time and given us the benefit of 
their administrations and counsels. It 
is astonishing how the work has in- 
creased from the time we commenced 
in 1884. True, the people then had but 
small records. Few indeed had gene- 
alogical records to any extent. But 
since that time strangers to this work, 
persons who had scarcely any faith in 
the resurrection of the dead or in a 
hereafter, have been inspired of the 
Lord to compile the history of their 



ELDER JOHN D. 



t. McAllister,

forefathers and give data sufficient for 
the Latter-day Saints to work in the 
Temples for and in behalf of their kin- 
dred dead. Many have hoped and pray- 
ed that ways might be opened up to 
them by which they might receive intel- 
ligence pertaining to their ancestors, 
and I testify before you that in many 
instances the prayers of such 
Saints have been answered, and 
they have received information 
pertaining to their kindred dead that 
has simply astonished them. They 
have come into possession of informa- 
tion that they never dreamed was in 
existence. The results have been that 
the work of the Lord in Logan Temple 
has been carried on to a surprising ex- 
tent by persons who thought they had 
no record whatever. I well remember 
persons talking with President Merrill 
and telling him they would like to work 
In the Temple, but they had no record. 
They simply knew a little concerning 
their parents and their brothers and 
sisters, but back of that they could not 
go. President Merrill advised them to 
do the work for those they knew about, 
and God would open the way for them 
to obtain information pertaining to 
their grandparents and others. They 
have done as advised, and the informa- 
tion promised has come to them, and 
they have come to President Merrill 
and others testifying that the predic- 
tion of Brother Merrill has been fulfill- 
ed. In some cases they have received 
books containing thousands of names of 
their ancestors. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren 
and sisters, that this is God's work. I 
testify tha.t Joseph Smith was an in- 
spired Prophet of God. Those who have 
succeeded him in the presidency of the 
Church haA^e also been inspired, and 
they have brought this work to its pres- 
ent standing. I know that this king- 
dom will triumph, because God has said 
so. This work will progress, salvation 
will be given to the living, if they will 
obey the laws of God, and redemption 
shall be brought to the dead, inasmuch 
as we will attend to the duties and re- 
quirements made of us by virtue of the 
calling whereunto we are called. May 



God add His blessing to us and help us 
to be ever faithful and true. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN D. T. McALLISTER 

(President of Manti Temple). 

I will try to -make you hear, if possi- 
ble. It is a good while since I spoke 
from this stand, and my voice is not so 
strong as it used to be. It has been 
used a great deal in the work of the 
Lord. I was on this ground when we 
built the tabernacle on the corner of 
this block where the Assembly Hall now 
stands. At that time our meeting 
place was over where the wall now is, 
in a little, rough house, but the meet- 
ings were greatly enjoyed by the Saints. 
That is fifty-three years ago. I have 
seen the growth of the people. Today 
we find a great people in these moun- 
tains, comfortably housed, clothed and 
fed, and enjoying the visits and bless- 
ings of the servants of the Lord who 
preside over us. "We have remembered 
our leaders and their families, and we 
pray always that the Lord will bless 
them, and that their families will be 
found walking in His ways. It is very 
nice indeed to have the privilege of 
meeting in this Tabernacle. I worked 
with the brethren when the house was 
built, and a good, sweet spirit was with 
us. The lumber that came here from 
the canyon, I measured it; and I also 
measured the stone work of the masons 
on the Temple, and reported it to Da- 
vid O. Calder at the President's office. 
I am sixty years in the Church, the 
eleventh of the month. I came into 
these mountains but a boy. I made 
the acquaintance of the boys that are 
now men, and some of them great 
grandfathers like myself. They have 
striven all that they could to carry 
out the purposes of the Lord, and 
some of them, I presume, count from 
thirty to forty children. We were poor, 
but the Lord blessed us. We worked. 
If we had nothing to eat, we asked 
the Lord to open the way, and He has 
done so. Today we find beautiful cities 
and beautiful temples. We commenced 
our labors here for the dead, I think, in 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Endowment House. The first en- 
dowments for the living given in Utah 
were given in the old Council House, 
which stood on the corner now occupied 
by the Deseret News building. Since 
then we have progressed until we find 
ourselves very comfortably located in 
the temples that have been erected un- 
der the blessing and power of God. 

For the last eleven years I have been 
in the Manti Temple. I succeeded Presi- 
dent Anthon H. Lund. Elder John B. 
Maiben is my assistant. I was called 
there by President Woodruff from the 
St. George Temple, where I presided in 
his absence, with Elders David H. Can- 
non and James G. Bleak assisting. 
What a glorious work has been done 
in that house of the Lord, and we re- 
joice that we were privileged to work 
therein. President Young sent for me 
and wanted me to go to St. George to 
assist in the temple. I made every- 
thing ready as well as I could and at 
once proceeded to assume the position. 

The work of the Lord in His house 
is for His sons and daughters. We 
have the word of God, and it is pub- 
lished. The way has been revealed for 
ourselves and our children to walk in. 
I wonder sometimes that our children 
who live so near to the house of the 
Lord should marry outside of it. When 
we do not marry in His house. we do not 
marry in His way. If we marry out- 
side of His house, it does for this life; 
but when we get beyond we have no 
claim upon each other. Sometimes our 
children go into by and forbidden paths, 
leaving the way of the Lord, but the 
Spirit feels after them, the parents feel 
after them, and they are brought to a 
knowledge of the truth, they receive 
blessings in the house of the Lord, and 
are numbered with the faithful today. 
The work for the dead is upon our 
shoulders. Joseph Smith, before he 
was assassinated, gave unto us the 
word of the Lord in relation to the work 
for the dead, and he quoted some scrip- 
ture in reference to it. Our fathers 
and our mothers have been sealed to- 
gether, the children have been sealed 



to their parents, and the work has been 
done for our kindred who passed away 
without a knowledge of the truth. This 
is the work that has been spoken of by 
our brethren, and it is increasing. In 
three days I sealed to parents over 
thirteen hundred children, and those 
that have done this work feel glorious 
before the Lord. 

I represent now the Manti Temple. 
This season we have been repairing 
the roof and the water-pipe. We have 
beautiful water, and all that we need, 
not only for temple work, but also 
to water the grounds. It will 
require a great deal of means, how- 
ever, to make that house as beautiful 
outside as it is in. We have one of 
the most beautiful temples in the moun- 
tains. It is well taken care of, and 
those who go in feel the Spirit and 
power of God resting upon them. Our 
brethren and sisters who were 
in ill health have come there 
to be administered to, and we 
have attended to them, and by the 
blessing and power of the Lord their 
sickness has been overcome and they 
are well today. We get letters some- 
times from those who have been blessed 
of the Lord in this way. It gives me 
joy to speak of the work in the temple. 
I must not forget to mention the faith- 
ful labors of those workers who have 
been sent unto us from the stakes of 
Zion. We release them, and some are 
sent again to help us. We have never 
had to stop on account of workei's be- 
ing absent. 

I thank the Lord that I have 
lived as Ion? as I have, to see our 
boys grown up to be men and to become 
ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I love them, and I am satisfied with 
them, and especially so with our breth- 
ren who compose the First Presidency. 
They are good men, the Lord's men, 
whom He wanted to lead, guide and di- 
rect in the affairs of Zion. Bless you, 
my brethren who preside; bless you, 
Saints, in your homes; may you con- 
tinue to be healthful, peaceful and full 
of love, and may all things work to- 
gether for your good, that you may

till your days are fully numbered on 
the earth. In the name of Jesus Christ.

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Material Prosperity of the Nation— Excellent 
Advice to Latter-day Saints and the People 
at Large. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may 
be with us the remainder of this confer- 
ence as it has been from the beginning, 
that the Latter-day Saints gathered 
here may each and all receive the 
words of encouragment and instruction 
which are necessary for their welfare. 

This has been a very remarkable year 
in the world. As we are all well aware, 
wars afflict the nations, and serious 
troubles, complications and accidents 
fill the world with sorrow. The Latter- 
day Saints, however, have dwelt in 
peace, and have been remarkably 
blessed and prospered, though in some 
sections they have suffered seriously 
from drouth. On the whole, we have 
very great reason to rejoice and to 
thank the Lord, not only the Latter-day 
Saints, but all the people of this great 
nation. I believe that when this year 
shall have closed it will go into history 
as one of the most fruitful and pros- 
perous that the nation has every en- 
joyed. The Latter-day Saints have not 
been prepared to take care of the great 
blessings that the Lord has bestowed 
upon ' them in the fruitf ulness of the 
earth; for a large percentage of our 
fruits and vegetables have gone to 
•waste, because we have been unable 
to utilize them. We have not been pre- 
pared with factories for the cannine of 
our fruits and vegetables, and have 
therefore not been in a position to make 
the best use of the blessings that have 
been so generously poured out upon us. 
It behooves us to make profitable use of 
the bounteous seasons which the Lord 
is bestowing upon the people, because 
they do not always last. The seasons 
vary greatly, and wisdom would 
dictate that with the capital which the 
people of this great state possess in la- 
bor and in means we should be pre- 



pared for the blessings which the Lord 
pours out upon us. We should estab- 
lish factories to utilize the raw. ma- 
terial with which the country abounds, 
and we should be ready and forehanded. 
Our barns and our granaries should be 
built, our factories should be estab- 
lished, ready for these fruitful seasons 
when they come upon us. We ought 
to take advantage of these fruitful 
years also to meet all our obligations, 
as we have been so thoroughly taught 
by our leaders, so that when the times 
of stringency and panics come upon us 
we will be in a condition to endure 
the strain and not be brought to bank- 
ruptcy and ruin. The sugar industry 
possibly comes nearer meeting the de- 
mands of the people than any estab- 
lished in this state; but In other lines 
of industry, there should be estab 
lished the necesasry facilities for 
making proper use of the blessings 
which the Lord pours out upon us. 

The Latter-day Saints should address 
themselves to economy and carefulness 
in their financial affairs. They ought 
to restrain any inclination to extrava- 
gance in every line, and to prepare 
themselveSj not only with manufactures 
and other arrangements for utilizing 
the resources of the country, but also 
to meet the hard times that come oc- 
casionally in the land. Trj.e fruitful 
seasons are now upon us, and possibly 
may last for a few more years, and then 
stringent times 'will come, as certainly, 
I presume, as they have come in the 
past. Forewarned, forearmed! Times 
will change in the future as 
they have in the past, and we 
need to be ready for the times 
as they chang.e The older part 
of the population have had experience 
and training, and they should profit 
thereby; but there are always genera- 
tions coming up among us that are un- 
trained and inexperienced, and with the 
idea perhaps that things will always 
continue as they are. A note of warn- 
ing has been sounded by our leaders 
during the years that are past, advising 
us, as Latter-day Saints, to free our- 
selves from debt, from mortgages and 
from obligations that we may not be 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



able to meet. All these contracts should 
be honorably fulfilled, and we should 
cease to be the slaves of obligations 
that bind us down and hamper us in 
our lives. We want to be men among 
men, and to have a measure of inde- 
pendence. I have felt it to be the de- 
sign of the Lord in giving to the people 
of our beloved state the prosperity 
that has come to us, that we should 
prepare ourselves for serious times in 
the future; for the lean years will fol- 
low those of fatness. I would like it if 
all Israel would listen, and address 
themselves most earnestly and with 
every effort in their power to freeing 
themselves from every obligation to 
the banks, to their neighbors, to the 
merchants, to the builders, and to all 
men that are in business. Clear off all 
your obligations, and be free. Have a 
little something in your granaries; havb 
some credit at the savings banks; and 
instead of living upon means that be- 
long to your friends, live on your own. 
Pay for your houses, for your machin- 
ery, for your wagons, for your mer- 
chandise, for the food you have eaten 
and for the clothes you have worn out. 
Do all this, and see the time when you 
can meet your business man and pay 
for his wares as you receive them* It 
is wonderfully comfortable for a man 
or a woman to be dressed in their own 
clothing, to live in their own house, and 
to own everything that they occupy 
and enjoy, instead of taking care of the 
means of other people and paying 
usury. Rather let them be in a shape 
to receive usury. I believe that 
it is quite pleasing to the Lord that we 
should be out of debt. I believe that 
He requires it of us. I have believed it 
for many years. I advise and exhort 
the Latter-day Saints to free them- 
selves from every obligation as soon as 
they can possibly do so. Though we 
may have yet a few years of prosper- 
ity, they will not be very many, and 
while the times are propitious you want 
to free your hands,- and then train 
yourselves to stay out of debt. Do not 
allow speculation and the prospect of 
great fortunes to lead you into the 
bondage of debt. That is the bondage 



that is upon some of the Latter-day 
Saints today. Hence I exhort my breth- 
ren throughout Zion to free themselves 
from all their obligations. I ask my 
brethren who have wealth, to take 
measures to make profitable use of the 
blessings which the Lord bestows upon 
us. There is profit in the canning of 
all. our fruits. I am not prepared to 
say what percentage has been wasted, 
but in my visits among the settlements 
I have found the lands upon which or- 
chards stand fairly covered with fruit 
that has fallen and is rotting. It is 
astonishing the waste that can be dis- 
covered in this land. It is astonishing 
the amount of canned goods that are 
brought into this State. It is a re- 
proach to the people of Utah. I re- 
member outfitting for a trip into Arizo- 
na from St. George a few years ago, 
and the canned grapes that we supplied 
ourselves with were from California, 
the canned meats were from California, 
the salmon and other canned articles 
were from Oregon or some other state. 
Turkeys, ducks, geese, poultry of all 
kinds are brought into this state by the 
carload. It is a reproach to the state. 
We ought to produce all these things 
ourselves, and also supply our neigh- 
bors. We have done exactly in the su- 
gar business what we ought to do in 
other lines. Today we make all the 
sugar that Utah consumes, and we send 
as much abroad to our neighbors. We 
keep the money here that pays for 
our own sugar, and we bring as much 
more into the state from the sale of 
s 'gar outside. It has assisted to make 
ojr state one of the most comfortable 
and independent states of the west. But 
it is not enough that we should save 
on the sugar business. We should be 
as wise in the handling of our grains, 
our vegetables and our fruits. They 
should be taken proper care of so that 
they may command the mar- 
ket, and be in demand in every 
direction. We are surrounded 
by mining camps, and Utah 
ought to furnish everything they need 
in an agricultural and industrial line, 
I want to advise business men, men of 
finance, to give attention to these mat-

ters, that our manufacturies may be 
increased, so that the materials which 
are given to us by the fruitfulness of 
the earth may be profitably used, and we 
become an independent people in this 
state. That is what I would like to 
see in Utah. We have a good country. 
We live in peace and in harmony; and 
in addition to all that we can do for 
ourselves, the hand of the government 
is reaching out to help us in the irri- 
gation of our country. There is mois- 
ture enough in this land, if only prop- 
erly utilized. The God of heaven has 
given us rains and snows and fountains 
of water that are almost abundant. 
If we would but take care of the re- 
sources that He has given to us, the 
state is well supplied with the neces- 
sary water, and I expect to see the time 
when the bench lands in all our valleys 
will be producing to their utmost capa- 
city. In our splendid state fair we can 
see evidences of what has been done 
this season in the way of dry farming 
by the experimental stations in this 
state. It is wonderful the grains that 
have been produced on the dry lands; 
and what has been done this year can 
be done generally, though possibly not 
always so well, because, as I an- 
nounced in the beginning, this has been 
a remarkable year. But we want to see 
the time when all these lines* of indus- 
try and fruitfulness are utilized and 
controlled by the people of Utah, so 
that we shall not have to bring flour 
and grain here from other states as we 
are doing today. We do not want their 
grains and vegetables and their poul- 
try to be in demand over ours. We 
do not want their pork. We do not 
want their hams, nor their lard. We 
should produce it here ourselves. 

My brethren and sisters and friends 
who dwell in the state of Utah, 
let us join together and utilize the 
ability, the wisdom and the capital that 
we have for the prosperity of this great 
State. I feel that it will be profitable 
for us to consider these things, and to 
make as much progress as we can, and 
not too slowly. It is wonderful what 
has been accomplished in some direc- 
tions. The mining industries of the 



state receive much attention and in- 
vestment, and we would like to in- 
vite capital to enter into other lines of 
business. We would like the million- 
aires and those who have become rich 
.out of the mines of this state, to help 
also in the establishment of manufac- 
tories that will give employment to the 
people, so that no man can come 
to the State of Utah, and complain 
of being out of employment. Such a 
cry should not be heard among us when 
the very elements all around are invit- 
ing factories and industries of every 
kind. We want the help of those who 
have wealth, those who have genius, 
and those who have business qualities. 
We would like to have them make Utah 
the gem of the mountains, the richest 
and the most inviting state -in the west. 
We do not object to prosperity— we 
would like it to beam upon all the peo- 
ple. We would like all to be united 
and to labor harmoniously together in 
state affairs, in business affairs, and 
in the affairs of citizenship generally. 
We desire peace; we do not want war. 
Latter-day Saints are a peaceable peo- 
ple. We love peace; we seek peace; 
we preach it, we teach it, we advise and 
counsel it, all the time; for this is the 
work of the Lord that the Latter-day 
Saints are engaged in. This is the land 
of Zion— the land of peace— the land of 
the pure in heart. The pure in heart 
will be happy; and those who are not 
pure and are not conscientious in their 
lives will reap the reward of sorrow. 
We ask you to repent and to reform in 
your morals, if there be necessity. We 
want to reform in our finances, in our 
societies, in our associations, and in 
our labors, that everything may be 
done pleasing to the Lord in this beau- 
tiful State, with its lofty mountains, 
with its plentiful supply of health, and 
with the blessing and the protection of 
these United States. Thank the Lord 
for personal liberty. Thank the Lord 
for the principles established by our 
forefathers upon this blessed land of 
Zion. How grateful we ought to be 
for this liberty and freedom, and let us 
make the very best use of it we possi- 
bly can.

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



Again I say, relieve yourselves, my 
brethren, from your financial obliga- 
tions. Before these fat years have 
past, make good use of everything that 
comes within your reach and devote 
your attention to the meeting of your 
obligations, so that you may become 
free men, and then contract no more 
debts. Keep out of debt, and be a free 
people, so that you will have means 
with which to be buried when you die, 
and a little besides to leave for the 
widow and the helpless children. Let 
us have things in a little better condi- 
tion than we have had them in the past. 
Avoid bankruptcy and ruin; for a man 
cannot be comfortable spiritually who is 
in bondage financially. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters, 
and enable us all to be wise and pru- 
dent in our financial affairs as well as 
in spiritual matters. As we have the 
great spiritual blessings, and know the 
way back into the presence of the 
Father, let us also seek the wisdom 
that will make us equal to the world 
in business affairs. May God keep us 
faithful and humble. May He inspire 



the hearts of the men who lead 
us, that they may be equal to the great 
work that is upon them. The Lord is 
with us, and will bring us off victori- 
ous. I know this as I know that I 
live. I know that Joseph Smith, the 
prophet of the nineteenth century, was 
sent of God, and he did his work most 
faithfully and well; and every one of 
his successors have been faithful and 
true to the end. As Jesus set the ex- 
ample for all men, so have His follow- 
ers, the prophets who have stood at the 
head of this great people, pet the ex- 
ample for you and me, that we should 
endure and be faithful and true to God 
and His cause always, and He will re- 
deem and save us most perfectly and 
fully. God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

"Our God, we raise to Thee 
'ii.? 'fcs for Thy blessings free 
We here enjoy." 

Benediction by Elder William Budge, 
president of Bear Lake stake. 



SECOND DAY. 



Friday, October 7, 10 a. m. 
The meeting opened by the choir and 
congregation singing the hymn: 

Redeemer of Israel, 
Our only delight. 
Prayer was offered by Elder Thomas 
Chamberlain. 
Singing by the choir: 

Ye simple souls who stray 
Far from the path of peace — 

That lonely, unfrequented way 
To life and happiness. 

ELDER HUGH S. GOWANS, 
(President of Tooele Stake.) 

I feel very pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, for the privilege of meeting with 
you in the general conference. To en- 
joy the society and fellowship of my 



brethren is inestimable. The associa- 
tion and fellowship of the Saints is all 
that I feel to live for; it is my joy, my 
happiness, my life. 

I l-epresent what is known as the 
Tooele Stake of Zion, located between 
the county of Salt Lake and the Great 
American Desert. The population of 
the stake is something over 3,000; and 
to give you a brief idea of the condi- 
tion of the people I will here state that 
it is 22 years this month since I was 
chosen to preside over the Tooele 
stake. At that time the population was 
about the same as it is now. In 20 
years there has been an increase of 159 
souls in that stake. The question might 
be asked, why is this? The answer is, 
our young people have gone away to 
different parts of the country. The 
Cassia stake has been settled princi- 



ELDER WILLIAM BUDGE. 



iy 



pally by people from Tooele Stake. We 
have had no particular inducements to 
offer for people to settle with us, like 
some of our northern stakes have, our 
resources have been so limited. But 
there is one feature that I feel pleased 
to report, and that is, during- all that 
time, although the increase of popula- 
tion has been so slight, the amount of 
tithing- paid by the people has been 
doubled. I take this as an evidence of 
an increase of faith on the part of the 
people, and possibly an increase of 
■wealth also. The Tooele valley is a 
very beautiful one, but our water sup- 
ply is quite limited, and we are not 
able to increase on that account. The 
land, however, is capable of much cul- 
tivation. An experiment farm was 
commenced there last year, and al- 
though I have not been to see the state 
fair yet, I am informed that the dis- 
play from the Tooele experiment sta- 
tion exceeds anything in that line in the 
fair. This is a very gratifying report, 
considering that the exhibit is the re- 
sult of what we understand of dry 
farming. We are living in compara- 
tive peace. We have mining camps in 
our Stake, and they furnish a good mar- 
Tcet for the products of the farmer, and 
in this respect they are beneficial to 
the people. We have no factories or 
public works in our county; but I feel 
that the admonition given to us yester- 
day by -'resident Lyman, in regard to 
the establishment of canneries and 
other : n.nstries, was very good advice 
to the people of Tooele county; for, as 
in other places, we have not been pre- 
pared to take care of the blessings 
which God has bestowed upon us as 
much as we ought to have been. 

J rejoice very much to be with you, 
and to make this report of the Tooele 
Stake. I pray that we may be enabled 
to live in the front ranks of the 
Stakes of Zion, enjoying the light of 
the Spirit of the Lord, and living in 
harmony with the authorities that God 
has placed upon the ea.rth. "To be in 
harmony" should be the watchword of 
every Latter-day Saint. That God may 
-enable us to do so, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM BUDGE, 
(President of Bear Lake Stake.) 
My brethren and sisters: I am very 
much pleased to have the opportunity 
of representing the Bear Lake Stake, 
though that pleasure would be in- 
creased if I were certain that I could 
speak so that the congregation might 
hear. It is not very pleasant to sit and 
not be able to follow the remarks of 
the speaker. I do not know how inter- 
esting my report may be, neither am 
I certain that I can interest you at all 
in reporting a country like Bear Lake, 
after the many very pleasant reports 
we have heard from presidents who 
live in more favored localities. The 
name of Bear Lake has been with many 
people the occasion of a cold chill com- 
ing over them, they laboring under im- 
pressions which they have received 
from reports made of the valley in the 
earliest times. I believe that Bear 
Lake is the oldest organized stake in 
Idaho. We are living 6,000 feet above 
sea level, and it is naturally a cold, 
country in the winter. The winters 
have been long and the summers com- 
paratively short, although, as I shall 
explain to you, there has been quite a 
change in the climate and in the length 
of the summer seasons, agreeable with 
the promises made by the leaders of 
the Church during their visits to that 
country. The first settlers went there 
in 1863, I believe, under the leadership 
of that noted pioneer and fatherly ad- 
viser, Apostle C. C. Rich. It was in the 
year 1870 that I was sent to labor in 
that country, and I have been there 
for 34 years, so I am well acquainted 
with the people and with their situa- 
tion. One portion of the Bear Lake 
Stake has been taken from it and called 
Star Valley Stake, another portion has 
gone to the Woodruff Stake, and a 
small portion to one of the other Stakes 
in Idaho; but we now have, I believe, 
a larger population than we had before. 
Bear Lake has prospered, and the 
Church has prospered exceedingly in 
Idaho, for we now have ten Stakes of 
Zion in that State, and all the Stakes 
are growing and increasing in popula-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion, and doubtless in faith and good 
works. 

When I went to Bear Lake I found 
the people wrestling- with untoward 
conditions. The country was quite 
frosty. Sometimes in the summer, 
when they expected a return from their 
labors in the fields, they were disap- 
pointed, in consequence of the action 
of the frosts. Many hardships were 
endured, which it is not necessary for 
me to take up time to refer to particu- 
larly; but the situation of the people 
was such during the early years of 
settlement, that it was necessary to 
haul almost all they needed for their 
support from other places, chiefly from 
Cache valley, which entailed a great 
deal of labor. Yet the people, trusting 
in the Lord and in the promises of His 
servants, continued to work and to 
build up, and we now have occasion to 
thank God for the fulfillment of the 
predictions of His servants. We now 
can raise grain without much fear of 
loss. Sometimes in certain places the 
frost touches the vegetation, and oc- 
casionally does considerable damage, 
but on the whole we are confident about 
raising the grain that we need. We 
have been quite self-contained in that 
valley in consequence of our situation 
in disposing of our products. We also 
raise all kinds of common vegetables. 
We do not raise potatoes quite as large 
as some we have heard of, but they are 
large enough to be handled convenient- 
ly, and they are of excellent quality, as 
are the other vegetables that are raised 
there. We tried to raise fruit in the 
beginning, but the frost stripped the 
trees. We planted out more, — the frost 
took them; and so it continued until 
about 12 or 15 years ago, when we be- 
gan to think about it a little more. 
President C. C. Rich used to advise us 
to get into that valley as soon as pos- 
sible after the October conference lest 
we might be snowed out, and many 
who were out a little late had to take 
longer roads to get home in conse- 
quence, and I remember some com- 
panies being snowed out altogether. 
But now the people travel in and out 
a'lmost till Christmas, so that the sum- 



mer has stretched out considerably,, 
and the winter is shortened probably 
six weeks or two months. Last win- 
ter we had more snow than we had 
for several winters, but some of the 
brethren traveled occasionally during 
the entire winter. 

When we speak of the favorable 
changes that have appeared in con- 
nection with many things, we are re- 
minded by some people that such 
changes are common in all valleys after 
settlement, cultivation, building of 
houses, the making of so many fires, 
and so on- — as much as to say that tnere 
is nothing at all remarkable about 
these changes. Now, I have no dis- 
position to say that changes of this 
kind are not brought about in this way, 
but it does not lessen in the least de- 
gree the thankfulness in my heart to- 
ward God for His goodness in bringing 
about the changes in any way He pleas- 
es. The Lord does His work among us 
in many ways. The means employed 
sometimes appear in part, and at other 
times they are not plain to us, yet we 
have a right to say that God has done 
it. It does not matter to a Saint how 
the Lord brings about changes in ful- 
fillment of His declarations through 
His servants, so long as they come. 
Hence we acknowledge His hand in all 
things. There is one peculiarity to 
which I might refer to aid us in our 
talks upon this point. It snowed a 
great deal in that country in the begin- 
ning, much more than it does now, and 
every time after a snow a strong wind 
arose from the north, not so strong as 
those winds which used to blow occa- 
sionally near Farmington, but strong 
enough to blow the snow from the 
benches down upon the towns, and 
against the buildings and fences, some- 
times covering up the fences complete- 
ly. This probably gave rise to some ex- 
travagant stories about Bear Lake val- 
ley. Now, although the beginning of 
the cessation of those winds was not 
particularly noticed by us, yet after a 
time we did observe that the winds 
ceased, and now we have no such winds 
to contend with. These winds were a 
great hardship to the people and pro-

ductive of much labor, the roads being 
filled up in a few hours, and people 
much inconvenienced by the snow be- 
ing piled up against their houses. And 
now that these winds have actually 
ceased, how shall we account for it? 
We may admit the cultivation theory 
in reference to the changing of the 
climate, but what shall we say about 
the cessation of the winds? Why, the 
Lord has done this as He has done 
other things for His people. In thif 
case, however, we cannot make any 
reasonable explanation as to how it 
has been done. We now raise grain, 
and vegetation of every kind. It is a 
good hay country, and we are raising 
fruit which is as good, and I might say 
a great deal better than most of the 
fruit that is raised in these lower val- 
leys; for we have no worms, and, what 
is better, if the testimony of an expert 
is to be taken, we are not likely to be 
troubled with them, as the altitude and 
climate are against the propagation of 
the pests, according to his statement. 
So we have fruit limited in quantity 
only by the efforts made to plant the 
trees. We have a glorious valley in 
the summer. We have many visitors 
in the summer time, and the old stories 
about the country are being forgotten 
in consequence of the good reports 
given by our friends who visit us in the 
summer time. Altogether we are doing 
fine; the Lord has blessed us and we 
acknowledge it. We have a fine lake 
in our valley— as beautiful a sheet of 
water as I have seen in some of the 
continental countries. The borders of 
the lake, though not improved much 
yet, are girded by the wild cottonwood 
tree, and in some parts it is a beauti- 
ful sight. The tired visitor may sit 
upon the golden sands of our lake, 
bathe his tired feet in the waters, if 
he is so disposed, and, reclining back 
under the scent of the sagebrush and 
the wild rose, may dream of happier 
days. 

The people of the Bear Lake stake 
feel exceedingly well. Our meetings 
are well attended. Our visitors from 
Salt Lake whom the Presidency kindly 
send us to attend our conferences and 



other meetings of a general character, 
understand that our people are good 
meeting attenders. The people pay 
their tithing so well that the Presid- 
ing Bishop says that we are in the 
first rank. So, take it all in all, we 
rejoice very much, and I believe I can 
say, judging from reports, that there 
are fewer of our people moving away 
from Bear Lake than from many other 
places. We rejoice in the work of the 
Lord. We uphold the authorities of 
the Church unanimously, and we are 
thankful for the goodness of our Heav- 
enly Father to us as a people in the 
Bear Lake stake. 

As for myself, I have been in the 
Church for a long time, having em- 
braced the Gospel in 1848. I have been 
honored with missions to different lands 
and among different peoples, and I have 
naturally made the acquaintance of the 
leading men of the Church; and I want 
to say to our stranger friends here that 
I have never seen nor heard of anything 
that has weakened my faith in the di- 
vinity of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I have met with a 
great many of those authorities of the 
Church that are spoken disrespectfully 
about, but I repeat I have not seen or 
heard one thing to disturb my faith in 
this work with which I have been so 
long connected. 

May the blessings of God be multi- 
plied upon the Latter-day Saints, and 
may great power be given to those who 
represent them at home and abroad, 
that the fulfillment of the predictions 
of the Almighty may speedily come to 
pass. This is my prayer and desire in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY, 
(President of Millard Stake) 

My brethren and sisters, it is with a 
degree of pleasure that I have the 
privilege of standing before you to 
represent the Millard Stake of Zion; 
and though I feel very timid I hope, if 
I may be blessed with the Spirit of the 
Lord, to be able to make a true report 
of the conditions of that Stake. On 
the twenty-first of next month it will 
be two years since I was called to take 



21 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the position that was filled by my 
father for twenty-five years in the 
Millard Stake. It is one of the largest 
slakes geographically in this State, 
having the same boundary lines as 
Millard county. We have 11 organized 
wards, with a population of 6,000 souls, 
a little over 5,000 belonging to the 
Church. We live in peace with one 
another, and while we have a thou- 
sand people dwelling in our midst who 
do not belong to the Church, with very 
few exceptions they are honorable peo- 
ple and good citizens. While President 
Smith yesterday was giving the number 
in the Church who hold the Priesthood, 
I thought of the Millard Stake of Zion. 
Out of 5,000 members of the Church we 
have 1,000 bearing the Priesthood. Our 
Priesthood meetings, which are held 
monthly, are well attended, and they 
are among the most enjoyable meetings 
held in that Stake. We usually have a 
full attendance of our High Council and 
Bishops. We are united in our labors, 
and the people are a good people. The 
population of the Stake remains about 
stationary, and has done ever since I 
can remember — and I was born in Mil- 
lard Stake. I feel in relation to the 
people of that Stake that the good are 
growing better, and many who have 
been careless and reckless are awaken- 
ing to a realization of the 1 fact that 
Mormonism is worthy of investigation, 
and as a result of investigation our 
Mutual Improvement associations have 
never been in as good a condition as 
they are at present. In the Stake 
Mutual Improvement convention held 
last month there were over 300 
interested workers present, and we had 
an enthusiastic and an enjoyable con- 
vention. In the 11 wards that we have, 
there are but three saloons, and, thanks 
be to the Lord, not one of them is con- 
ducted by a Latter-day Saint. Con- 
cerning the morality of the peo- 
ple, in the last four years 
I know of but one case of 
divorce among our people. The faith 
of the people is good, and they love 
the Lord. The authorities of the stake 
are united in their efforts. As to my- 
self and counselors, we love one. an- 



other, we love our labors, and we are 
moderately well acquainted with the 
conditions of the people generally, be- 
ing able to call all of them by name; 
and, knowing their lives and under- 
standing their faithfulness, we love 
them. We are united in support of the 
general authorities of the Church. We 
live in a locality that, is barren in many 
parts for the lack of water, still there 
have been many predictions made con- 
cerning the development of the Millard 
Stake of Zion. We have faith in those 
predictions, but we are not content to- 
idly wait for their fulfillment. As the 
Lord shall make manifest unto us what 
to do, we hope to labor until there shall 
not be any amount of water unutilized 
in the stake. We hope to see all avail- 
able ground bro.ight under cultivation 
that can be made to produce.even with- 
out water, until a much larger popula- 
tion can be supported than at present. 
We know that this result will be 
brought about, for the servants of the 
Lord, filled with the spirit of inspira- 
tion, have made these predictions unto- 
us, and the Spirit of the Lord has tes- 
tified unto us that the predictions were 
true and would be fulfilled. 

As to myself, I feel happy in the work 
of the Lord. I rejoice that I was born 
of goodly parents. I cannot recall a 
moment in my life when I doubted the 
divinity of this work. I have always 
looked upon the Authorities of this 
Church as being servants of the Lord. 
I can remember in my childhood when 
President Young: used to make his trips 
through the stakes. My father pointed 
him out to me as the servant of the 
Lord, and I looked upon him as a 
Prophet of God. From that day to this, 
I have looked upon the various Presi- 
dents of the Church as Prophets of the 
Lord, and I have felt to sustain them, 
not only by my faith and prayers, but 
by my works as the Lord should mani- 
fest unto me what there was for me to 
do. The Lord has given me a testi- 
mony of the truthfulness of the Gospel. 
I know it is true, and I doubt not. 
When I was called upon a mission to 
the Netherlands and placed in one of 
the cities there, unable to speak a word 



ELDER A. H. SCHULTHESS.

of the language, I gazed into the faces 
of those people as I walked along, and, 
feeling that they were honest, a 
yearning desire filled my heart to be 
able to bear testimony unto them of 
the truthfulness of the Gospel. I felt 
that I was not an ordinary man, but 
that I was sent out as a messenger 
from the Lord; and being filled with 
that desire, and unable to speak the 
language, I studied and labored hard 
to become acquainted with the Dutch 
tongue, and on many occasions I fast- 
ed and prayed. There was a time when 
I was almost discouraged, and felt that 
I could not acquire that language, but 
upon one occasion the power of the 
Lord rested upon me, and I think I 
would be justified in mentioning the 
incident in this conference. I had 
learned from some Dutch brethren a 
few simple sentences, which enabled 
me to go around delivering tracts. As 
I delivered each tract I would say that 
it was a Latter-day Saint tract, and 
that I would call for it in a few days; 
but if the people wished to converse 
with me I could not understand them. 
One Friday, Brother B. G. Thatcher 
and I were out and gathered nearly ev- 
ery tract, leaving about 12 out. He 
was called to remain in the office at 
Rotterdam on the morning when this 
incident took place, and it occurred to 
me that inasmuch as I was able to ask 
for a tract, I might as well gather these 
tracts that were still out. The first 
house I went to, the lady opened the 
door, passed me the tract, and said, 
"Who are you?" I could understand 
that, and I had learned to say that I 
was a missionary, representing the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. She said, "Why didn't you say 
"Mormons?" I did not realize at the 
time what a change had taken place in 
my hearing through the power of the 
Lord, but I could understand every 
word that that lady spoke to me. She 
)said many vile things against thle 
Church, which I knew were false, and 
I was filled with a yearning desire to 
be able to speak to her, and refute the 
slanderous statements she made against 
an innocent people. I testify to you, 



my brethren and sisters, I did receive 
upon that occasion, through the power 
of the Lord, the gift of tongues suf- 
ficiently to bear testimony to the di- 
vinity of the work of God, and to de- 
fend an innocent people, so much so 
that the woman herself was impressed 
by the Spirit of the Lord, for she broke 
down in tears and said: "There may be 
bad people among the Latter-day 
Saints, but I know that you are a ser- 
vant of the Lord." I mention this to 
show that though we may sometimes 
feel downcast and discouraged, the 
Lord will never forget His servants, 
and when they need His help He is al- 
ways ready to help them. I bear tes- 
timony to the truthfulness of the Gos- 
pel in the name of Jesus. Amen, 

ELDER A. H. SCHULTHESS 

(Of the Presidency of Liberty Stake). 

My dear brethren and sisters, with 
my brethren I feel very thankful for 
this oppotunity of attending our 
general conference. I regret, however, 
that the conditions of so many of our 
people at present are such as to pre- 
vent them from having this privilege; 
but the hope fills our hearts that a day 
will come when the people of God will 
be able to lay aside their temporal af- 
fairs for a few days and devote their 
time to the worship of the Lord in the 
conferences of His Church. I feel 
honored in being called to speak to you 
for a short time and to represent the 
Liberty Stake of Zion. Our stake wa3 
organized on the 26th day of Febru- 
ary, this year. It is one of the four 
new stakes which formerly constituted 
the Salt Lake stake. Our President, 
Elder Hugh J. Cannon, is at present on 
a mission, presiding over the Swiss 
and German mission, where he has been 
for the last 38 months. During his ab- 
sence it falls to the lot of myself and 
fellow counselor to take cnarge of the 
affairs in the stake, and I can testify 
to you that while we feel our unworthi- 
ness in our positions we have experi- 
enced great joy in our labors among 
the people. Liberty stake embraces* 
eight wards, located in the southeastern, 
part of this city, with a total member- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ship of about 5,600. I take pleasure in 
listening to the reports of the presidents 
of other stakes and in reading in the 
Deseret News reports of the various 
stake conferences held throughout Zion, 
and in doing so I notice quite a differ- 
ence in our conditions. For instance, 
I have read that in some of the stakes it 
requires as much as from three to six 
days for the president to visit one of 
the wards in his stake. In our stake 
we can board an electric car at one 
end of the stake, and in less than 30 
minutes can ride to the other end of the 
stake, making the round trip for 10 
cents. If necessary, we can call a 
meeting of all the officers in our stake 
on 30 minutes notice and have all the 
brethren present, if they are not absent 
from the city. These conditions, I con- 
sider, are in our favor, and on this ac- 
count more may be expected from us 
than from other stakes. 

I can say nothing but good of those 
with whom we are called to labor in the 
Liberty stake. Our Bishops and coun- 
selors are united among themselves, 
and with the presidency, and we feel 
to sustain one another. Thanks be to 
God, so far we have been able to work 
in perfect harmony. The High Coun- 
cilors, the Bishops, the various officers 
in the Stake, are good, faithful men. 
The object of dividing the large Salt 
Lake Stake was that the people might 
toe looked after more thoroughly than 
was possible before, the Stake being so 
very large. We have already seen the 
advantages of this division. The peo- 
ple get closer together, and the officers 
can look after them better than was 
possible when the Stake was so large. 
Our meetings are better attended also. 
For example, at our last monthly 
Priesthood meeting we had a larger at- 
tendance, I believe, than we used to 
have when all the four Stakes were in 
one. The advantages of this division 
are also apparent in other ways. 

Our auxiliary organizations are do- 
ing a great work in assisting the Priest- 
hood to look after the people. We have 
endeavored to explain to the Saints the 
importance of laboring with those who 
have grown weak in the faith, and I 



have pleasure in saying a good word 
for the Saints in this direction.for many 
of them have followed our advice and 
are doing a great deal of good in this 
way. Where they see a young man or 
young woman who is on dangerous 5 
ground, or one who has grown cold 
in the faith, they have taken up an 
individual labor with them in love and 
kindness, and have endeavored to bring 
them into line with the Latter-day 
Saints who are keeping the command- 
ments of God. Already we can see 
the results of their labors, and we re- 
joice therein. We feel that it is the 
mission of the Latter-day Saints to la- 
bor not only for the salvation of their 
own souls, but for the salvation of the 
whole human family. This was the 
mission of our Savior. His whole life 
was devoted to the salvation of man- 
kind, and He died for the same. His 
disciples followed in His footsteps, and 
they devoted the greater part of their 
lives in bringing salvation to the people, 
and many of them lost their lives in this 
service. The same mission and duty 
has been placed upon the Latter-day 
Saints. It was the mission of our 
great Prophet Joseph Smith. It has 
been of his successors up to the pres- 
ent time. They have labored for the 
salvation of the whole human family. 
Why is it that this Church has nearly 
two thousand Elders out today preach- 
ing the Gospel? Because they are la- 
boring for the salvation of man, carry- 
ing the glad tidings of great joy unto 
all nations, kindreds, tongues and peo- 
ple. Why is it that we erect temples 
in the land of Zion? In order that we 
may labor for the salvation of the dead 
This is our mission, at home and abroad, 
and we should fulfill this duty to our 
neighbors and friends in the various 
wards and stakes where we reside. I 
can testify to you that there is great 
satisfaction in performing such labors. 

I" rejoice in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I know that this is the work of God, 
and not of man. In our Stake we de- 
sire to be united, and to sustain the 
leading brethern of the Church, for we 
know that they are men of God. We 
desire to lighten their burdens and to

uphold their hands wherever we can, 
and to accomplish as much good as we 
possibly can, to the honor and glory 
of God and for the working out of our 
own salvation. May God bless us and 
help us to be faithful, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

"From afar, gracious Lord, Thou hast 
gathered Thy flock." 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

The Saints should seek to impress others 
with the truth of the Gospel— Obligations 
they are under in that regard. 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, 
in the privilege of being with you in 
attendance upon this conference. The 
condition of my health prevented me 
from being present at the April confer- 
ence, and I have not been able of late 
to discharge in any great degree the 
duties and responsibilities of the calling 
under which I labor. But I am pleased 
to say to you today that my condition 
is very much improved, and I trust that 
my voice will be heard in the various 
stakes of Zion with the same activity 
in the immediate future as has charac- 
terized my labors in the past. 

I have rejoiced in the spirit of the 
conference. The considerate and 
thoughtful remarks of the Presidency 
yesterday, bearing upon our duties and 
obligations: the practical instructions 
that were given yesterday afternoon by 
Elder Lyman; the reports of our breth- 
ren who are ministering in that field in 
which we are so intensely interested — 
the work for the dead — all appealed to 
me very forcibly. I have also listened 
with interest to the remarks made by 
the presidents of stakes this morning, 
and I trust that their reports may be 
an inspiration to us who are convers- 
'ant with the conditions of the people 
in the various sections where we live. 
I was more than pleased with the re- 
port of President Hinckley. The spirit 
of it especially struck my heart, when 
in speaking of the people who lived in 
his diocese he not only remembered the 
people of his own faith, but 
also those who werei not of 
his faith and he spoke of them in 



a respectful, considerate manner and 
bore witness to their good character. 
I believe that a remark of that kind, 
coming from the lips of a man of his 
standing, will bear fruit in the future 
in the overthrow of animosities and 
the awakening in men's minds of a 
spirit of fairness and justice to one 
another. I believe that the souls of 
the thousands of people who have made 
their homes in this inter-mountain re- 
gion are as dear to our Heavenly Fa- 
ther as the souls of the thousands who 
are scattered abroad and who have not 
been made conversant with the work 
that we have to do. I trust that some 
remarks, made recently in one of the 
stake conferences by President Lyman, 
found lodgment in the hearts of those 
who were in attendance upon that ser- 
vice, wherein he impressed upon the 
minds of the Saints the sacredness 
of their obligation to endeavor 
to impress their neighbors with 
the truth of the gospel they themselves 
have received, and thus free themselves 
from the responsibility of the blood of 
their fellowmen. That obligation should 
lie very near our doors, and should be 
discharged thoughtfully and prudently 
by us. Not that we should seek to har- 
ass our neighbors by trying to force up- 
on them our faith and doctrines; but in 
our associations with our fellow-men, 
in our business affairs, and in the dis- 
charge of the varied requirements that 
rest upon us all, we are brought into 
immediate contact with many men of 
fairness and of uprightness, some of 
whom perchance have no religious faith 
while many may be members of the va- 
rious religious organizations, and it 
rests with us to discharge this obliga- 
tion to these neighbors of ours. When 
President Lyman sprung the question 
as to how far we had gone in fulfilling 
this duty and seeking to impress upon 
the minds of our fellows the nature of 
the work so dear to ourselves, I was 
led to ask myself whether I had fairly, 
honestly and frankly discharged my 
duty in this respect. "When President 
Hinckley spoke in such a respectful 
manner of those not of his faith I was 
led to think that probably every Pres- 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ident of a stake, every Bishop of a 
ward, conversant with the condition of 
the people in their midst, could reit- 
erate his statement concerning their 
neighbors. I trust that we will not be 
unmindful of the fact that some men 
and women in our communities have 
received the Gospel after living in our 
midst. They have watched the lives 
of the people, have become impressed 
with the nature of the work, and have 
accepted of it. It is probable that 
sometimes we are too thoughtless in re- 
gard to our responsibility to these peo- 
ple. We mingle with them, week in 
and week out, transact business with 
them, and yet never presume to seek 
to bring to their understanding that 
faith so near to our own hearts. I be- 
lieve that in these matters the possi- 
bilities of accomplishment in the future 
are very great, if we will but discharge 
our obligations to these men and wo- 
men who have come here, without 
doubt, to better their condition, and to 
enjoy the privileges and blessings that 
are vouchsafed to us by the liberal gov- 
ernment under which we live. One 
President of a stake, with his associ- 
ates, has recently been considering this 
question and weighing the possibili- 
ties of a missionary work that 
shall be in keeping with the best 
interests of the Latter-day Saints as 
well as make its impress upon our 
brothers and sisters whose faith is not 
as our own. This can and should be 
done upon the basis of frankness and 
fairness, with no desire to crowd upon 
our fellonvmen that which is sacred to 
us, but in a way and manner that shall 
appeal to their thoughtful considera- 
tion, and cause them, while weighing 
the doctrines as presented by the re- 
ligious organizations of the worlds to 
also consider and weigh the views and 
doctrines as presented to the human 
family in the mission and ministry of 
the Prophet of God in this last dispen- 
sation. I believe that there opens up 
for us a wonderful work in this direc- 
tion, to be thoughtfully and prudently 
done. I know of no reason why my 
neighbors who are not of my faith and 
myself should be enemies, so long as I 



preserve their liberties and my own 
justly and rightly, and am willing that 
they should 'worship God according to 
the dictates of their own consciences, 
while insisting upon the enjoyment of 
that right for myself. I know of no 
reason why the men who are united to- 
gether in their citizenship and in the 
upbuilding of a commonwealth should 
not be able to associate together in 
friendship, guarding with sacredness 
that which is dear to us all, respectful 
of one another's faith, courteous in 
our treatment of one another's family, 
and considerate in our regard for every- 
thing that tends "to the upbuilding and 
ennobling of man. 

The work of the ministry that has 
been entrusted to us requires the 
preaching of the Gospel to every nation, 
kindred, tongue, and people. The 
brother who preceded me has dis- 
charged that obligation in several lands 
himself; and.as another of the speak- 
ers remarked, he had been at work in 
the ministry since 1848. Another brother 
made the remark that he had labored 
to extend the work of tne Almighty in 
a foreign land, and had undergone 
hardship and trial in seeking to secure 
to himself a knowledge of the language. 
All this is but a part of the fulfillment 
of that sacred obligation which was de- 
clared necessary in the introduction of 
this dispensation of the fullness of 
times, namely, that the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus was to be preached in all the 
world, and that a heavenly messenger 
would fly through the midst of heaven 
bearing this decree. To this end the 
brethren who have spoken this 
morning have discharged that ob- 
ligation. In many instances our 
Elders have gone hungry, have 
been banished, and have been made 
outcasts in the countries to which they 
have gone to discharge that most sacred 
obligation. They were not enemies of 
their fellowmen; they were not im- 
planting one theory that would lead a 
man to perpetrate a wrong; their 
warning voice was raised only in 
declaration of the primary principles 
of the Gospel as enunciated by the 
Redeemer of the world Himself. Their

ministry was to impress upon the minds 
of men and women who had read the 
Scriptures, the sacredness of those 
writings, the character of the work laid 
down in them, and the necessity of the 
human family obeying the require- 
ments of heaven, as taught by the 
Redeemer of the world to the young 
man who came to him asking what he 
should do in order to obtain eternal 
life. His instructions to that young 
man were clear and explicit: "Thou 
shalt do no murder, thou shalt not 
steal, thou shalt not bear false wit- 
ness, honor thy father and thy mother; 
and, thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself." The burden of the ministry 
of the servants of God in the day and 
age in which we live has been the ful- 
fillment of that requirement. They 
have sought to lay the foundation of 
the Gospel in the souls of men upon 
the basis presented by the Redeemer in 
the cuf^e of Nicodemus. He pointed 
out that the course to pursue was to 
enter in at the door of the Gospel, be 
baptized of the water and of the spirit, 
and walk in harmony with the princi- 
ples enunciated to the young man. 
Those who have addressed you during 
this conference have had part in the 
accomplishment of that ministry. Not 
one of these men has ever counseled a 
man to steal, or to lie, or to bear false 
witness against his neighbor, or to 
violate the honor of any man or wo- 
man, or to take the life of a fellow 
creature; but each of them, in the dis- 
charge of his sacred duty as a servant 
of God, has proclaimed the divine mis- 
sion of the prophet of this dispensa- 
tion, the visitation of heavenly mes- 
sengers, and the restoration of the 
Gospel in its fullness and purity. Christ 
and Him crucified has been the 
theme dwelt upon by these Elders, and 
they have gone forth in the per- 
formance of this responsibility 
without money and without price. 
Not one living can of a truth 
say that any of these have coun- 
seled them to violate the laws of 
their country and to trample be- 
neath the\ir feet the institutions 
of the state; for the articles of faith 



of the Latter-day Saints lay down the 
proposition that the members of this 
Church are to obey the laws of the 
country in which they live, to maintain 
the principles of liberty and justice, and 
to deal rightly and properly with their 
fellowmen. 

Standing before you, my brethren and 
sisters, as one of the witnesses of 
the mission of the Redeemer of the 
world, and of the restored truths of the 
Gospel given in the day and age in 
which we live, I bear this record in 
your presence today. I have grown 
from childhood to manhood in 'connec- 
tion with these leading men of the 
Church of Christ. I knew Brigham 
Young as intimately as a boy could 
know his father. I knew John Taylor, 
Wilford Woodruff. Lorenzo Snow, in 
like manner. I have been as intimate 
with President Joseph F. Smith as 
kinsman could be. Standing here 
as a witness before God today, I sol- 
emnly declare that I have never re- 
ceived one item of instruction from 
these men and from the Council of the 
Apostles— those of the old school as well 
as those of the present school— that did 
not breathe words of life, words of en- 
couragement, words of loyalty and de- 
votion to every element of true man- 
hood. Those who have violated the 
rules of morality have turned back up- 
on the instructions of the authorities 
of the Church of Christ. Those who 
have stolen have disobeyed the instruc- 
tions of their associates. And when I 
speak of these men as the leaders of 
this Church, I would speak the same of 
these Presidents of stakes with whom 
I have been conversant, and whom God 
has blessed and made great in the ac- 
complishment of good. The require- 
ment laid at our door is that he who is 
warned, let him warn his neighbor. It 
is upon us to fulfill that duty, to dis- 
charge that obligation, and to acquit 
ourselves fully of its responsibilities. I 
trust that the goodly words spoken by 
the brethren as affecting you who are 
Saints shall make its impress upon 
those who are not united with you in a 
knowledge of the truth, but to whom 
the seeds of the truth must be carried

GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



and they utilize their agency to accept 
or reject it. 

The Gospel is true. The angel of God 
spoken of by the Prophet of old has 
flown through the midst of heaven, 
"having the everlastingGospel to preach 
to them that dwell upon the earth, to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and peo- 
ple." Upon the head of this man (point- 
ing to President Smith) and his asso- 
ciates today lies the responsibility of 
seeing to it that every child of our 
Father within reach shall hear that 
witness and accent or reject it. My 
witness before you is that God has 
spoken, that His truth is established, 
and that His Church is in the Avorld. 
God, the Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ have spoken to man in this dis- 
pensation. The key has been turned, 
and the work is in motion. It lies at 
our door to see to it that every child 
of our Father shall hear that warning 
voice, if within our power. While we 
discharge this obligation, we want to 
discharge our obligations of citizen- 
ship in justice and right, standing for 
the principles of liberty, in the interest 
of every other mortal as well as our- 
selves; for if we should seek to take 
away the liberties of any man, it would 
only result in the destruction of our 
own liberties. Those who plot and 
scheme for the overthrow and destruc- 
tion of your liberty and mine are not 
alone the enemies of the Latter-day 
Saints, but they are the enemies of lib- 
erty, the enemies of God the Father, 
the enemies of justice and mercy, and 
in the due time of the Lord, it will come 
their turn to pay the penalty of out- 
raged mercy and justice. 

May God bless you with His Spirit. 
May the feelings and sentiments of this 
conference go forth to the world, show- 
ing that here are indeed true Chris- 
tians, who love Christ and the princi- 
ples of righteousnef,^, and who pro- 
pose to devote themselves to the ac- 
complishment of our Father's purpose 
and to the blessing of His children to 
the utmost limit. God bless the good 
and noble among mankind. May He 
remember the statesmen of our land, 
that they may fulfill their destinies in 



righteousness, and that 'justice may 
characterize the land. God bless the 
people in this land who stand by the 
principles enunciated by the fathers of 
the republic, so that they may never 
be overthrown, but that beneath the 
flag and under the Constitution of the 
United States the right of conscience 
shall never be infringed, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 
Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah. 

Jesus --minted that "Prophet and 
Seer," 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

Benediction was pronounced by Ed- 
win Woolley, president of Kanab stake. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

The choir sang the hymn: 

"Softly beams the sacred dawning 
Of the great Millennial morn, 

And to Saints gives welcome warning 
That the day is hasting on." 

Opening prayer by Elder Charles F. 
Middleton, of Weber stake. 

Singing by the choir: 

"Lord thou wilt hear me when I pray! 

I am forever thine! 
I fear before Thee all the day, 

Oh, may I never sin." 

ELDER JOSEPH H. GRANT, 
(President of Davis Stake.) 
I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, 
in having the privilege of reporting the 
Davis Stake of Zion. I love the people 
of that stake, because of their faith- 
fulness. We have many good people 
there, and very few that are bad. There 
are about 7,000 people in the stake. Most 
of them are Latter-day Saints, some of 
them are "Mormons," and some are 
non-"Mormons." I rejoice to say, how- 
ever, that many of those who are not 
Latter-day Saints are among our best 
citizens. We mingle together, and »we 
have the sympathy largely of those who 
are not of us. We are endeavoring, by 
the help of the Lord, to keep this good 
feeling; and if those that are older do 
not feel inclined to accept the Gospel, 



ELDER J. G. 

perchance many of their sons and 
daughters will do so, in fact, they are 
doing so. In Davis stake we feel that 
we must have the hearts of those that 
live among us in order to get them to 
join with us, the same as we find in 
the missions abroad. We rejoice that 
we have this good feeling and this good 
class of people living with us. 

The Davis Stake of Zlon was reor- 
ganized a couple of weeks ago, with 
myself and Elders James A. Eldredge 
and Jesse M. Smith as the presidency of 
the stake. We feel very weak in tak- 
ing the places of those that presided 
over the stake before us, as we realize 
that some of the best men that ever 
lived on the earth, among them Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith himself, have 
presided over that stake. We feel that 
nothing but the direction of the Spirit 
of the Lord can qualify us to t o forth 
and do anywhere near as well as our 
predecessors. But we know that the 
work of God is true. We have proved 
that in going to Him for help and sup- 
port He will not desert us, and we re- 
joice in this. I am thankful for the 
help that I have in our High Council. 
It is a strong body of men — men who 
are willing to work in any capacity, 
and who labor particularly as home 
missionaries and as peacemakers in the 
stake. They have been so successful 
that for three or four years at a time, 
there has been no necessity for a High 
Council trial. There are 18 Patriarchs 
in the stake. Most of these men are 
doing a great deal of good in blessing 
the people, holding cottage meetings, 
dedicating the home's of the Latter-day 
Saints, and warming up the hearts of 
those that have grown cold, as well 
as teaching the Gospel to those who 
have not yet accepted it. Our organi- 
zations are complete, with strong work- 
ers at their head. The Lord is bless- 
ing us in our stake, and we rejoice in it. 
We feel to sustain and hold up the 
hands of the Prophet of God, with his 
counselors and the Apostles, who have 
been called to lead and direct the af- 
fairs of the work of the Lord upon the 
earth, and I pray that this spirit may 
continue with us. I ask for your faith 



McQUARRIE, 29 

and prayers, that I may be enabled to 
accomplish what is required of me. I 
rejoice in my heart that I am able to be 
here, for I have been in very poor 
health during the last year. The Lord 
has blessed me, however, with one ot 
His great gifts — to have faith in the 
promises made to me through His ser- 
vants. I pray that God will continue to 
bless and to guide us into all truth, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER J. G. McQUARRIE 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

There are times, my brethren and 
sisters, when we feel that we are sep- 
arate, single individuals and when we 
feel to draw down the shades and close 
the doors of our homes. There are other 
times when either a common sorrow 
01 a common joy gives us the desire 
to throw up the blinds, to open the 
dcors, and to invite all our brothers and 
sisters to look into the light and com- 
fort of our homes. So, too, there are 
times when we feel a desire to throw 
our souls open, that our friends and our 
brothers and sisters may look in and 
see the warmth, the love and 
the joy that we feel for them. That 
is my feeling today. I wish I could 
throw my soul open to you, that you 
might see the love and the joy which I 
have in associating with my brothers 
and sisters after an absence of six 
months. It is such a pleasure for us 
to get back again among the home- 
guard, and to meet with our friends in 
Zion. One of the greatest joys that I 
have had, perhaps the greatest joy that 
the president of a mission feels is in 
meeting the mothers and the fathers of 
the noble sons or daughters that may 
be laboring under our guidance. To- 
day, as I looked into the eyes of moth- 
ers lit up with pride when I told them 
of the good works and noble deeds of 
their sons, and watched their eyes fill 
with tears and their faces quiver with 
emotion, I thought how grand it is to 
feel that warm, true, godlike love of a 
mother. I will not be able to meet all 
the mothers and fathers of the noble 
boys that I have the honor to preside 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



over, but I want to say to you that 
they are all doing you honor where they 
are laboring, and without an exception, 
I believe, are giving God the very best 
that is in them; and that is all anyone 
can do. 

In mission work, like other labors, 
there seems to be a kind of ebb and 
flow. Some seasons we reap a good 
harvest, while others we do not get very 
much fruit from our labors. Last year 
was a very fruitful one. We gathered 
in the harvest. This year the result? 
in the Eastern States Mission, so far 
as baptisms are concerned, are not so 
encouraging. Still we have had enough 
success to keep us from being discour- 
aged, and enough opposition to keep 
us stirred up. During the early part 
of the season, there was quite 
a severe storm which seemed to break 
with rather terrific force over the 
Eastern States mission, and while it 
did not shake any of those who were 
members of the Church, it seemed to 
blight some tender plants among those 
who were just commencing to investi- 
gate the Gospel, and of course those 
plants have not borne us any fruit. 
But we feel encouraged in our labors. 
Perhaps you have noticed in the papers 
the account of the re-baptism of John 
Rigdon, the or.ly surviving son of Sid- 
ney Rigdon, who was a counselor to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. Sixty-six 
years ago, I believe, John Rigdon was 
baptized by Hyrum Smith in the Mis- 
sissippi river, and I think the Prophet 
Joseph Smith confirmed him a member 
of the Church. He was a bright, bril- 
liant, promising youth, and I can not 
help but think of what he might have 
accomplished, where he might have 
stood in the councils of the Church, 
andi how far his influence might have 
extended, if he had exerted all his en- 
ergy in trying to establish the princi- 
ples which God had revealed from 
heaven, rather than directing his mind 
toward the weaknesses of men. I feel 
grateful that the sons and daughters 
of the first families of the Church are 
gradually being gathered into the fold 
again. It is also a striking testimony 
to me, as it may be to others, when we 



witness such events, because men like 
Sidney Rigdon knew whether Joseph 
Smith was a prophet or not. There was 
no guess work upon their part. Joseph 
testified that he and Sidney Rigdon 
saw Jesus Christ in the Kirtland Tem- 
ple, and he was in a position to abso- 
lutely know whether he had witnessed 
this manifestation, and whether 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God or 
not. And so, when the effort of his life 
was over, when he was about to pass 
into eternity, his son approached him 
and asked him what position he should 
take in reference to Joseph Smith — 
whether he was a prophet and whether 
the Book of Mormon came as he said 
it did. With tears streaming down his 
cheeks, Sidney Rigdon testified that 
the Book of Mormon was true, that Jo- 
seph Smith was a pi-ophet of God, and 
that the world would yet know it. 
That testimony clung to his son, and, 
ringing in his ears, made him afraid to 
die before being reconciled to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. Oliver Cowdery was also in a 
position to know absolutely whether 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God or 
not, and he, too, before he passed away, 
seemed anxious to come in again at the 
door and regain his fellowship in the 
Church. This should be a witness 
to us, and especially to the young, of 
the truthfulness of the Gospel. Not 
only so, but it should be a warning also 
to the bright sons and daughters of 
La>tter-day Saints, that they should not 
waste their energy in looking for and 
criticising the weaknesses of some frail 
individuals who may be placed in re- 
sponsible positions, but that they 
should rather exert their energies in 
trying to establish the principles of the 
Gospel, which have been revealed for 
the very purpose of strengthening frail 
humanity. We are all weak, but the 
Gospel is true, and it will strengthen 
those who live it. 

I feel not only to report the condi- 
tion of the Elders who are laboring un- 
der my direction, but also some of those 
who come to study and to gain techni- 
cal and professional knowledge. I am 
glad to say that where they have the 



ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN,

•opportunity to attend our meetings 
the great majority of them are trying 
to keep in touch with the Saints and 
with the Church, and in many instances 
they are reflecting credit upon the peo- 
ple of God and upon the community 
that is responsible for their training. 
In every instance where they try to live 
the Gospel and are not ashamed of 
the truth, they not only honor their 
people, but they honor themselves. I 
was glad to note that in the graduating 
class of the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons at Baltimore, where four gold 
medals were given, two of them went 
to Utah boys, and one of these was the 
first medal; and a good minister had 
the honor of reading out their names 
and awarding these prizes to our Utah 
boys. Another instance I will take 
pleasure in mentioning. In the gradu- 
ating class from the law school in 
Washington two years ago, there was 
■one young "Mormon" Elder who had 
preached the Gospel, and who had 
fainted on the streets from exhaustion 
and hunger while he was trying to pro- 
claim these truths to the people. This 
"Mormon" Elder, who was competing in 
a. class with the brightest and smartest 
sons of America, was elected president 
•of his class by acclamation— an honor 
perhaps that was never given to anyone 
before in that school. 

I desire, in conclusion, to bear my tes- 
timony to the truthfulness of the Gos- 
pel. I testify that all those who will 
incorporate its principles in their lives 
and live them will know they are true. 
The Eastern States mission is in a 
fairly good condition. "We are con- 
stantly growing a little, and some of 
our members are gathering to Zion. I 
am proud of all those that I have had 
the pleasure of meeting since I came 
here. I pray that the blessings of God 
may rest upon Zion, upon those who 
preside in the Church, and upon all the 
Elders who are laboring abroad, with 
those who preside over them, and I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES G. DUFFIN. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

I feel very grateful, my brethren and 
sisters, for the privilege of meeting 



with you in this conference. I have felt 
greatly blessed in listening to the in- 
structions of our brethren and to the 
reports that have been given, as well as 
•the beautiful testimonies that have 
been borne of the goodness of our Fa- 
ther in heaven to His children here up- 
on this earth. "We feel blessed in our 
labors in the Central States mission, 
That mission embraces the states of 
Kansas and Missouri, and all of the 
states south of them to the Gulf of 
Mexico. The people who reside in those 
states are, as a rule, broad and liberal, 
warm hearted, and they accord to our 
Elders many privileges that are neces- 
sary for them to have in order to car- 
ry -on the work of the Lord. In the. 
cities of St. Louis, Kansas, St. Joseph, 
and many other cities in that mission, 
the men who have been elected to office 
accord to our Elders the same privi- 
leges that are enjoyed by ministers of 
other religious denominations; and in 
some cities, where the ordinances are 
against street preaching, we have 
found, in going to the mayor and chief 
of police, that though it was neces- 
sary for them to deny us the privileges 
we asked for because of these ordin- 
ances, they have treated us most cour- 
teously. The governors of some of 
these states whom I have met have 
excellent ideas of the Latter-day 
Saints, of whom they speak well, and 
they admire the courage that this peo- 
ple has manifested in the development 
of the great arid west. The Elders in 
that mission travel, as a rule, without 
purse or scrip, following the revelation 
of the Lord given through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith; and it is not a common 
thing for our Elders to go hungry or 
thirsty, nor to sleep out of doors, but 
their wants are supplied by the good 
people of those states. I want to say 
too, my brethren and sisters, that all 
of the ministers who are in that mis- 
sion are not bitter opponents of the 
Latter-day Saint Elders. I have met 
a number of broad-minded, fair men 
who wear the cloth. They have been at 
our conferences at some places, and we 
have given them the privilege of speak- 
ing, and they have spoken good words 
concerning the Mormon people. On one 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



occasion a very prominent minister ad- 
vised the people to open their doors to 
Mormon Elders. Now I feel that 
it is much better for us to 
look at the good in men, than to always 
be seeking for something that is not 
good. I believe it is better to speak of 
that which is uplifting in our fellows, 
than of the little weaknesses that we 
all give way to at times. I am one of 
those who believe that the world is get- 
ting better. I do not believe for one 
moment that this work which our 
Father in heaven has established is a 
failure, and if you could convince me 
that the world is not getting better, I 
should be apt to think that the work of 
the Lord was a failure. I do not mean to 
say^ but what the wicked are getting 
more wicked, because I believe that to 
be true; but in a general way I have 
x:eached the conclusion, from seven 
years' experience as a missionary, that 
the effect of the teachings of the ser- 
vants of the Lord, the distribution of 
millions of books and pamphlets treat- 
ing upon the principles of eternal life, 
the labors of your sons and daughters 
in the homes of the people, are all 
having their effect to plant the prin- 
ciples of truth in the hearts of the 
people, and to turn mankind unto works 
of righteousness. More than once in 
my experience I have had great, strong 
men come to me and tell me of their 
past lives, and take counsel from me. 
I have seen those men break down and 
cry like children. Then I have followed 
the course of those men, and though 
they did not unite themselves with this 
Church, I have observed that their lives 
have been purer and better in every 
way than they were before. In yeavs 
past, when writers for papers and mag- 
azines have described the "Mormon" 
Elder, they have generally described 
him as a man with lor.T hair, of un- 
couth appearance, uneducated, ignor- 
ant, and rough in his address. I am 
pleased to learn that this is changing. 
A number of papers that I have seen 
within the last few years have de- 
scribed the "Mormon" Elders as well 
educated, of pleasing address, bright 
and intellectual young men. And when 



I have seen these testimonies con- 
cerning your boys who so out into the 
world, I have thought that even the 
enemies of the work of the Lord have 
borne witness, though unwittingly, to 
the power that there is in this Gospel 
for the uplifting of mankind. 

The headquarters of the Central 
States mission are in Kansas City. That 
city is located in Jackson county, Mo. — 
the land that we have looked forward 
to all our days as the place 
which the covenant children of 
our Father in heaven should re- 
deem; a spot that is sacred to all 
Latter-day Saints. Let me say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that the 
people of that country are changing 
very agreeably in their sentiments 
tcward this work and people. Prominent 
men of the State of Missouri would 
welcome the Latter-day Saints if they 
should go back there today, and in my 
opinion it will not be a great many 
years until the work of our Father in 
heaven will open up in that land and 
the way be prepared for the building of 
that beautiful temple and for the re- 
demption of that land, which our 
Father has said should be redeemed by 
His people through purchase. In 
thinking over the preparation that is 
essential to be made for that great 
work, I have wondered if we were pre- 
paring ourselves individually to do 
something toward it. What is the 
preparation that is essential? There 
is a revelation contained in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, in Section 105, and 
in tha-t the Lord gives the information 
that His children who will engage in 
that work must learn to live the laws 
of the celestial kingdom. One of the 
laws of the celestial kingdom is to be 
honest and true with our fellows, to be 
honorable in all our dealings and as- 
sociations, and to have our hearts de- 
voted to eternal principles. T take it 
that a man or a woman who is not in 
that condition, is not very well pre- 
pared to assist in the establishment of 
the eternal principles of righteousness 
in a part o£ the land where Satan has 
been determined that the work of God 
should not be performed. 



ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON,

I have advised our young men in that 
mission to give some attention to the 
temporal conditions that surround 
them in their missionary labors, to visit 
the factories and the industrial institu- 
tions that are in the way of their trav- 
els, to study the farming- interests, and 
to give attention to the growth of the 
country generally, so that when they 
return to their homes they may not 
only show themselves as strong spirit- 
ual characters, but they will also have 
ideas that can be applied in a temporal 
way for the benefit of the work of the 
Lord. Since I have been here on this 
visit, I have been riding out a little 
over the country in the Utah Stake of 
Zion, and I have become more fully 
convinced than ever that this is an es- 
sential part of our work; for on every 
hand I see opportunities for industrial 
development that are lying dormart. 
I see waste upon the farms of the peo- 
ple; I see the fruit going to waste 
by the thousands of bushels, while we 
are importing into this State tens o;' 
thousands of dollars worth of canned 
goods. On a farm that I arranged for 
the purchase of the other day, I saw 
upwards of two thousand bushels of 
peaches going to waste, and I thought 
then, if our brethren had united and 
expended a little means, all that could 
have been saved, and employment could 
have been given to many of our young 
men and women, which would have 
helped them very materially in secur- 
ing the means necessary to enabl" 
them to attend one of our great schools 
in the State during the coming winter. 
I cannot help it, brethren and sisters, 
if my mind runs upon temporal as well 
as spiritual things, for I believe that 
both are essential. And so we are 
striving to direct the minds of our 
boys in the mission field along these 
lines, though not by any means neglect- 
ing the spiritual things of the kingdom. 
We advise them to observe, and to 
study, so that when they come home 
they may have some ideas that can be 
applied practically for the good of 
their brothers and sisters. 

Now, may the Lord bless you. May 
His spirit be with you forever. I know 



that this is the work of the Lord. 1 
know that Christ is the Savior of the 
world. I know that Joseph Smith was 
raised up by our Father in heaven to 
establish this work upon the earth in 
the latter da5 r s. This is my testimony 
to you in the name of Jesus our Lord. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

While I speak to you,, my brethren 
and sisters, I desire the Spirit of the 
Lord, and I ask that you will assist 
me by your prayers of faith; for al- 
though I know I am in the house of 
my friends, and that here my kindred 
dwell, still there is greater fear in ad- 
dressing you than there would be if I 
were called upon to speak to the people 
of the world. I sense the fact that we 
have a message to convey to them, 
which is new to them. We oan teach 
them some of the simple things per- 
taining to the plan of life and salvation, 
which our children here have heard 
from the lips of their fathers and 
mothers, as well as from the organiza- 
tions which are helps of government in 
Israel. Therefore, I desire that you 
will pray for me so that I may 
be strengthened by the Spirit of God 
to speak of those things that will be of 
interest and of benefit. 

The testimony of my brethren in re- 
gard to missionary work is much the 
same as I would give. I love my asso- 
ciates and companions. I greet the fa- 
thers and mothers of the Elders in our 
mission, and I assure you* that as the 
Lord gives us strength and life, and 
keeps us humble, we are striving to up- 
hold the principles that you have in- 
culcated in our minds. For I want to 
tell you mothers that despite the learn- 
ing that your sons have received in 
schools, in religion classes and in the 
higher institutions of our State, the 
teachings of the mothers shine out be- 
hind it all, just as does the name of the 
great architect of the mighty tower 
which Ptolemy Philadelphus erected to 
his memory. You may remember that 
this great king had thought to perpetu- 
ate his name by erecting what was once 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one of the wonders of the world, and 
in order that he should not be for- 
gotten.he ordered that written high up- 
on its face, should be his name; and by 
the lights at the top of this tower the 
mariners at sea and in the delta of the 
Nile were guided at night. His name, 
however, was inscribed in plaster, and 
in time it wore away, and the name of 
Sostratus, the Greek, shone out as the 
architect and the builder of that great 
pile. And so in the inner life, and in 
the labors and the devotion of the El- 
ders in the missionary field, shine out 
the teachings of the mother. They 
breathe anew the prayers they have 
learned at mother's knee; they live for 
the love of mother. Men have come to 
me in tears and have told me how in 
times of trial, when the tempter 
would have beguiled them, and 
they would have listened to his voice, 
and have departed perhaps from the 
path of rectitude, the face and the 
prayers of mother have arisen before 
them and they could not do it. I want 
you mothers in Israel to know that I 
feel this way, so far as the teaching? 
you have given your sons are concerned. 

Speaking of material things, it is not 
long since that a gentleman called at 
our office and asked for the president of 
the mission. When he found who it was 
it rather astonished him to see such a 
boy, and he wanted to know if I was 
sure of the matter. He then proceeded 
to take off a great muffler and disclosed 
the uniform of a Catholic priest. He 
said to me: "Mr. Robinson, I am a 
Catholic priest, but I have come to the 
conclusion that no man can live a cor- 
rect life in celibacy. I am desirous of 
taking to myself a wife and answering 
the ends of my creation by raising a 
family. I know nothing of your re- 
ligion except that your people are the 
most successful colonizers in the world; 
that you are a home-building and a 
home-loving people; that the system of 
economics which has prevailed 
among your people, the plans 
laid out by your founders in 
making settlements and bringing the 
people together, has brought to the 
smaller hamlets many of the privileges 



of city life in the way of drama, music 
and art, and that nausteology or home- 
sickness is hardly known among them. 
I am desirous to know what opportu- 
nity there would be for me to get a 
home among your Saints." I assured 
him that he could not expect to gain a 
living or to build a home among us 
without effort and labor; that there was 
no paid ministry with us, and that he 
could not receive a salary for teaching 
and preaching, as he was receiving at 
that time. He replied that this would 
not deter him from the effort. The cru- 
cial point with him, however, was 
whether we believed that Jesus Christ 
was the Son of God or not; and When I 
told him that we most assuredly did, 
and that we believed what the Scrip- 
tures said, that there is no name given 
under heaven by which mankind can be 
saved except the name of Jesus Christ, 
he remarked, "Well, I presume that in 
a sense we are all sons of God, but I 
do not believe that Jesus the Christ 
was any more or less than the son of 
Joseph." And yet he was a teacher of 
Christianity! I have been asked three 
other times in my missionary experi- 
ence, whether we, as a people, believed 
in Jesus the Christ — once by a sprig of 
nobility from England, and twice by 
other travelers — and my first thought 
was, how useless it is to work against 
such lack of understanding upon the 
part of the people. Then, I thought, 
why the very fact that they know so 
little of us and of our belief makes 
it all the more necessary for us to 
preach to them the Gospel of Jesus the 
Christ; to let them know that God has 
spoken from the heavens; that His 
Church, with all its gifts and powers, 
its Priesthood and authority, has been 
established on the earth for the salva- 
tion of men; that Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God; that Prophets and 
Revelators guide the Church today, and 
that the destiny of the Church of Christ 
is assured. For I know, my brethren 
and sisters, that men of God, men who 
are led by His Spirit, are at the helm, 
and that they will guide most success- 
fully this work in the. last days for the 
uplifting of humanity, until all nations

shall have heard the sound of the Gos- 
pel, and until every knee shall bow and 
every tongue confess that Jesus is the 
Christ to the glory of God the Father. 
I know, not only by what I have seen 
and read of the fulfillment of prophecy, 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet, but 
by direct inspiration and revela- 
tion, as every man and woman 
many know by seeking for it in 
sincerity and faith. I well remember 
when, as a raw country boy, I first 
came into this Tabernacle and heard 
President Taylor addressing the con- 
gregation, and as he did so, he put up 
his coat collar, rounded up his shoul- 
ders, and warned the brethren and 
sisters that there was a storm coming 
and for thein to prepare to meet it. 
He foreshadowed what would take 
place because of certain conditions, and 
predicted that our fathers and mothers 
would suffer, and many of them per- 
haps would die in exile, while others 
might be incarcerated in prison and 
our property confiscated. I put that 
down as the first utterance of a prophet 
of God that I had heard. Did I live to 
see the fulfillment of it? Why, I re- 
member in my own father's family, 
when on one occasion I went to visit 
him, as he did not rear me. Tha 
shades of night were falling, the sun 
was sinking in the west, and he came 
to bid me good night. I had thought to 
spend the night with him in converse, 
and so I said, "Father, you are not 
going away, are you?" Said he "My 
boy, because I will not ignore those 
whom I have sworn to cherish and 
love, I must find safety in the caverns 
and rocks up here above our city," and 
none of his sons knew where he laid 
his head at night. And so, I know, 
from some things that have entered 
into my life, that God reveals His se- 
crets unto men, and that those who fear 
Him and keep His commandments need 
not be in the dark nor have doubts and 
misgivings. They may know, by the 
light of eternal truth, that the Gospel 
is true, and that it will save and ex- 
ait all men in the presence of God who 
will obey it. God grant that we may 
be true to it, that His peace may be in 



our homes, joy in our hearts, and love 
towards all men actuate us, that plen- 
ty may wait upon our gates, and that, 
eventually, we may be saved with our 
loved ones in His presence. This is my 
prayer in Jesus' name. Amen.

Value of General Conferences— B ernul Na- 
ture nf th" Laws cf ihe Go.«pel -Snlvatn n 
for tue Dead as well as the Living. 

Brethren and sisters, truly the wis- 
dom of heaven was shown by the Lord 
when He instituted in His Church these 
general conferences. In many instan- 
ces those who otherwise would separ- 
ate never again to meet in this life, 
greet each other on the Temple block, 
old acquaintances are renewed, and a 
feeling of brotherly love and friendship 
is promoted. How impressive is the 
thought that this vast concourse of peo- 
ple gathered from all parts of Zion, 
even from the very uttermost parts 
thereof, and from some of the missions 
of the world, are assembled beneath the 
shades of this roof, having laid aside 
their daily employment, and the care.3 
of the world for a few days, that they 
might listen to these glorious songs of 
Zion, that they might wait upon the 
Lord, and hearken to what He may 
have to say to them by the mouths of 
His servants; that they might pause, 
that they might ponder upon the things 
of God, and that they might consider 
the Gospel of salvation. And let me say 
to you, brethren and sisters, that the 
heights and the depths of the Gospel 
are quite beyond our reach. The finite 
mind is not capable of wholly compre- 
hending the great plan of redemption. 
We, occasionally, have a glimpse of 
its power and beauty; but we must 
learn line upon line, precept upon pre- 
cept, here a little and there a little, un- 
til we come up to the full stature of a 
man in Christ Jesus. It cannot be com- 
prehended in a day, or a month, or a 
year; it is the study of a life-time. We 
have been taught that our Father in 
heaven sits enthroned in power, exalt- 
ed, glorified, in the midst of eternity; 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and, moreover, that He looks upon His 
children as though we were in eternity. 
His dealings with the children of men 
are made with reference to eternity. 
Mark these words that occur in one of 
the revelations, for they are very beau- 
tiful, and impressive, yet simple: 

"Wherefore, verily I say unto you, 
that all things unto me are spiritual; 
and not at any time, have I given un- 
to you a law which was temporal; nei- 
ther any man, nor the children of men; 
neither Adam, your father, whom I 
created. 

"Behold, I gave unto him command- 
ments, but no temporal commandment 
gave I unto him, for my command- 
ments are spiritual; they are not na- 
tural nor temporal, neither carnal nor 
sensual." 

How grand is the knowledge express- 
ed in this language. We have come to 
learn that the commandments which 
God has delivered to His Church par- 
take of His character. He is spirit- 
ual, eternal, everlasting, from everlast- 
ing to everlasting; hence the command- 
ments which He gives are spir- 
itual, eternal, everlasting. So the 
Ten Commandments, several of which 
were repeated by one of the speakers 
this morning, are appropriate to thf. 
time in which we live and suited to our 
condition; but not more so to us than 
they were to the people in the days of 
the Savior, and not more so to them 
than to the children of Israel, to whom 
the commandments were delivered. 
They are applicable to the children of 
men in all ages of the world, because 
they are eternal, and partake of the 
very nature of God Himself. 

Take, for example, the principle of 
faith, which is one of the foundation 
stones of the Gospel. I say to you 
that the principle of faith is as firm 
as the very pillars of heaven. It can 
not be changed nor modified to suit the 
opinions of men or of any particular 
condition of the world. The principle 
of faith is the same today as it ever 
was. Adam, in the garden of Eden, 
must of necessity have exercised the 
principle of faith, otherwise he could 
not appear well in the sight of God. 



Without faith it is impossible to please 
God in any age of the world. This 
great law of faith is unchangeable. 
Why? Because God is unchangeable, 
and it belongs to the everlasting Gos- 
pel. 

Consider, for a moment, the great 
law of repentance. It is binding upon 
this Church. We must consider it and 
meet its requirements. It must have ' 
an influence in our daily lives. God 
has said that He can not look upon sin 
with the least degree of allowance. 
Hear it, O Israel! It can not be con- 
doned, it can not be excused, it can not 
be winked at, because confronting sin 
is this preat and eternal law of re- 
pentance. If we will have absolution, 
if we will have forgiveness of sin, we 
must submit to the law and repent. 
I say — no, I do not say it — it is declared 
in the Gospel which we have received, 
that no man or woman can be saved in 
the kingdom of God except by faith and 
repentance. Salvation cannot be pur- 
chased. It is a free gift of God, and it 
comes through His Gospel. And in 
this matter, as in all things, God is no 
respecter of persons. He who sins in 
this Church, be it a small or a £reat 
transgression, must repent. It matters 
not in whom the sin may be found. In 
the President of the Church? Yes. In 
his counselors? Yes. In the Twelve 
Apostles? Yes. The Presidents of the 
Stakes, the Bishops of Wards, and the 
leaders of Zion? Yes. In the 
lay members of the Church? Yes. It 
affects the most influential as well as 
the humblest in the Church. When 
children come to years of understand- 
ing and accountability, must they re- 
pent and forsake sin? Yes. Those who 
do not repent, those who do not yield 
obedience to this great and immutable 
law of the Gospel, will go into spiritual 
darkness and, peradventure, will lose 
the faith. 

Take the principle of baptism — anoth- 
er great foundation law of the Gospel. 
Oh! how simple is this ordinance, to 
some perhaps even foolishness, that a 
man or woman, by going down into the 
water and being immersed can have his 
or her sins washed away. How is this? 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 



37 



We do not know. We only know that 
God has so instituted it. It is a part 
of His plan. It is set forth in the 
scriptures with great clearness, and 
you may read it in the revelations, that 
those who would have their sins re- 
mitted must submit to this simple or- 
dinance. By study and reflection, we can 
see the beauty of the ordinance. We 
can see that it is typical of death and 
the resurrection, and that as man goes 
into the grave and is called forth again 
out of the grave to a newness of life, to 
immortality and eternal life, so he goes 
into the waters of baptism, is buried 
therein, and comes forth again to a 
newness of life upon the earth. Being 
relieved of his sins, he is a new crea- 
ture, with a new heart, with new pros- 
pects, and with bright and glorious 
hopes before him. 

Then take the ordinance of the lay- 
ing on of hands for the reception of the 
Holy Ghost — an ordinance that is so 
much neglected and apparently so little 
understood in the world, and yet so im- 
portant. The Spirit of truth, the Spirit 
of light, of wisdom, of intelligence and 
of knowledge, is conferred by this or- 
dinance, whereby men and women can 
compherend the things of God; and 
without the Spirit of God this is im- 
possible. 

Now let me impress upon your minds 
the fact that it takes just as much to 
save the! dead as the living, and what- 
ever ordinance is conferred upon th<» 
living for their salvation in the King- 
dom of God must also be conferred up- 
on the dead. Hence these glorious tem- 
ples which have been erected in our 
midst, that ordinances may be per- 
formed therein for the living and the 
dead. In this we see again that God is 



no respecter of persons, and that He is 
feeling after the dead as well as after 
the living. We cannot be made per- 
fect without our fathers and mothers 
and our ancestors, and they cannot be- 
made perfect without us. Oh, how 
glorious is the contemplation of the plan 
of redemption that is so far reaching 
in its effects! It will discover us; yea, 
it will find every spirit that has 
been born into the world. If 
our great progenitors of this land, or 
of any other land, shall enter the celes- 
tial kingdom, if they shall sit down 
with the righteous of all ages, they 
must go in at' the door; for the house 
of God is a house of order, and there is 
no other way. Remember that Jesus 
Christ, the great exemplar, submitted 
Himself to the ordinances of the Gos- 
pel. He demanded baptism of His ser- 
vant, John. There is the pattern, the 
example to the world, even to the great 
men of the world, and if they would 
come and enjoy with us the blessings 
and salvation of the Kingdom of God, 
they must submit, in all humility, as a 
little child, to these glorious ordinances 
of the Gospel. We declare it as the ser- 
vants of the Lord. We testify to the 
truth of these things. 

May the Lord bless you. May His 
Spirit abound in the hearts of the peo- 
» pie, and be with us during the contin- 
uance of this conference, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, October 9, 10 a. m. 
The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word; 

What more can He say than to you He 

hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have 

fled. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Seymour 
B. Young, president of the Seven Presi- 
dents of Seventies. 

Singing by the choir: 

On the mountain top appearing 
Lo! the sacred herald stands, 

Welcome news to Zion bearing, 
Zion long in hostile lands. 

Mourning captive! 
God Himself shall loose thy bands. 

ELDER BEN E. RICH, 
(President of Southern States Mission.) 

There is always a feeling of timidity 
with me when I arise to speak before a 
congregation of any size, but it seems 
as though it is increased when I face a 
congregation like this. I can only pray, 
my brethren and sisters, that I may be 
influenced by the whisperings of the 
Spirit of God for the short time that I 
shall address you, and that the 1 same 
Spirit may also rest upon you. We are 
told that we can understand the things 
of man by the spirit of man, but to 
understand the things of God it is nec- 
essary for us to enjoy the Spirit of 
God. It is as necessary to listen by 
the assistance of that Spirit as it is to 
si eak under its influence. 

It has been my lot, for some little 
time past, to labor in the missionary 
field known as the Southern States 
mission. It is probably the oldest mis- 
sion in the United States, and perhaps 
in the Church. Many of the prominent 
men who stood with the Prophet Joseph 
labored and bore their testimony in 



that missionary field. A great many 
people have joined the Church in that 
section. Large numbers have emigrated 
to Zion: and the fathers and mothers, 
tho grandfathers and the grand- 
mothers of many of the youth of Zion 
today were found by the Gospel in the 
sunny south. In no place upon this 
earth can a more hospitable and kinder 
people be found. During my stay there, 
thirteen hundred Elders have labored 
in the South. They have taken their 
grips and gone out among the people, 
and lived where night overtook them. 
They would go to a house where they 
could see it was washday; they would 
walk boldly" up and tell thej folks that 
they were ministers of the Gospel, trav- 
eling without purse or scrip, and 
preaching the Gospel as Christ com- 
manded it should be taught, and then 
humbly ask if they would wash some 
linen for them. In this way they got 
their laundry done for them. At the 
time we had five hundred Elders in the 
field, it was remarkable how few of 
them had to sleep out in the woods. 
Whether the people belonged to the 
Church or not, they would entertain 
and feed the Elders. And God will 
bless all, whether in His Church or 
not, who entertain His servants. The 
people of the South are the religious 
people of the United States. They love 
to hear preaching; they read the 
Bible. There is less of fashion 
and less of a desire to go 
and show new bonnets and diamonds 
in the churches of the South than in 
those of the North. They are a God- 
fearing and God-loving people. While 
their prejudices are very strong, their 
love is strong also. 

At present, we have less than a hun- 
dred and seventy-five Elders in the 
field; and if we were to release all who 
have been there for two years we 
would have less than a hundred and 



ELDER BEN. E. RICH, 



39 



twenty-five, where we once had about 
five hundred. While we have between 
eight and nine thousand Saints in that 
mission, they are so badly scattered 
that it seems almost impossible to get 
enough of them together to maintain 
one healthy branch of the Church. 
Some months we baptize eighty or nine- 
ty new converts. When I left we could 
not fill the calls made of us to go and 
preach the Gospel and to baptize peo- 
ple who had been converted and were 
ready for baptism. We do not want 
our friends, the enemy, to think that 
"Mormonism" is losing ground in the 
Southern States. There seems to be 
an awakening in the hearts of the peo- 
ple, a desire to know God's will, and 
our Elders find plenty of opportunity 
to preach the Gospel; and the more per- 
secution and opposition, the more op- 
portunities we have for preaching. Our 
Elders are faithful and energetic. 

There is one thing that I want to 
mention here regarding Elders who 
return from the South. Sometimes 
Elders in that mission lose their health, 
and they are often home years and 
years without regaining it. Many 
times they should come home before 
they do; but I have had Elders say to 
me, "Brother Rich, I would rather stay 
here and die, than to go home before 
I have been here two years, and ful- 
filled an honorable mission, such a one 
as will gain me the approval of my 
Heavenly Father, and my brethren and 
sisters at home. There is no such 
thing in this Church as a two-years' 
mission. Sometimes it is just as much 
the will of God for an Elder to return 
home when he has been absent six 
months as when he has been absent 
three years. If the people here 
would only have confidence in 
the ones whom the authorities of 
the Church have appointed to preside 
over missions, they would then cease 
their gossiping about an Elder return- 
ing home before his two years are up. 
Should there be anything radically 
wrong with an Elder returning home, 
the presidents of missions understand 
that it is their duty to report the case 
to the authorities of the stake; and 



when it is not reported, and an Elder 
returns home in six or in twelve 
months on account of ill health, 
the Saints should extend to him 
as loving a welcome as they 
would if he had been absent two 
or three years. When they come home 
sick, you ought to sympathise with 
them, not criticise them. Very few ever 
come home before they are expected 
from any other cause than sickness. 
Sometimes an Elder comes to a mission 
when he could do the work of God more 
good at home than abroad, and when it 
is better for the mission that he should 
return home. In cases of that kind the 
presidency of the Church have instruct- 
ed the presidents of missions to send 
them home. You know what the "Mor- 
mon" creed as laid down by President 
Young was: "Mind your own business." 
When you send one of your sons to 
the Southern States, then it becomes my 
business and not yours. I am amenable 
to the authorities of the Church, and if 
I see fit to send an Elder home when 
he has been there six months, es- 
pecially if he is sick, sympathize with 
him, pray with him, help to build him 
up, and do not try to tear him down. 
By the way, if mankind could only ob- 
serve that "Mormon" creed, what would 
it not do for this world. God has said 
that He will forgive whom He will, but 
He gives us to understand that we are 
expected to forgive all men. Our busi- 
ness is to forgive; the judging part be- 
longs to God. Let us mind our own 
business, and not interfere with that 
which belongs to our Father in heavem 
He has said that He will mete judg- 
ments ,out unto those who deserve- 
them; and He has told us to have faith, 
hope and charity, and to love one an- 
other. 

We know that the Gospel is true. We 
know the conditions existing in the 
world, and if we do not love one an- 
other what a disagreeable condition we 
are in. The world do not love us, and 
•we do not expect them to love us; for 
Christ has said that if we were of the 
world the world would love its own, but 
because He has taken us out of the- 
world the world hateth us. So we need 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not expect the world to love us; but we 
should love one another. We should 
not only love one another, but we have 
been commanded to let our love go 
over the wall and to love even our ene- 
mies, always remembering the love 
that God the eternal Father had for 
the world, which was so great that He 
gave His only begotten Son, that who- 
soever would believe on Him might 
have eternal life. 

This is the mission of the Latter-day 
Saints. We are very small in numbers 
compared with the fifteen hundred mil- 
lions in the world, yet we are expected 
to carry the light of the Gospel to all 
mankind. Hence we have plenty to do. 
We know that God has spoken in the 
age in which we live, that He has re- 
stored the Gospel of His Son in ful- 
fillment of prophecy, that He spoke to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that by rev- 
elation and the voice of God this 
Church 'was organized through the in- 
strumentality of Joseph Smith, that 
the organization is perfect, that the 
Gospel has been sent out just as it al- 
ways has been when God's power has 
been upon the earth, and that it is made 
free to all men. The requirements of 
salvation are the same today as they 
were in the days of Christ. Man must 
have faith in God and in the divinitv 
of Christ's mission. He must repent of 
his sins. He must understand that 
those who reject the principle of bap- 
tism reject the counsel of God against 
themselves. He must remember that 
Christ Himself said that baptism 
was necessary in order to ful- 
fill all righteousness. He must 
understand that it was taught by Pe- 
ter, by John, by James, by Paul, and 
by all the Apostles, as also by the 
Priests, the Elders and the Seventies 
who were commissioned and sent out in 
that day. There is but one plan of sal- 
vation, but one way to eternal life. No 
man has the right to climb up any oth- 
er way. There is but one way of re- 
ceiving the seal of the Spirit. It is nec- 
essary for us to be born of the water 
and of the Spirit to enter into the king- 
dom of God, because Christ Himself 
said so. The faith of the Saints of old 



has been given to us, and we are con- 
tending throughout the length and 
breadth of the earth for the faith once 
delivered to the Saints and now deliv- 
ered to us. We have been commanded 
to go into all the world and cry re- 
pentance; yea, for the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand. You know that this 
is true, if you have not driven the 
Spirit of God away from you; and if 
you know 7 the truth, then you know the 
Master's will, and you must remember 
that he who knoweth the Master's will 
and doeth it not w r ill be beaten with 
many stripes. 

I wish to bear my testimony to you 
that I know that the Gospel has been 
restored to the earth in this age. I know 
that Joseph Smith was one of ' the 
greatest prophets that ever stood upon 
this earth. Without the learning of the 
world, by placing himself in commun- 
ion with the Spirit of God, and in say- 
ing, "Thus saith the Lord," by the 
whisperings of the Spirit.he pointed out 
the organization of the Church and set 
the house of God in order as the Lord 
revealed it to him; and the theologians 
of the world from that day to this have 
failed to find one single flaw in the or- 
ganization of the Church or in the re- 
quirements of salvation to be found in 
the Church. Whence came the superior 
wisdom of Joseph Smith, if it did not 
come from God? As a farmer's boy he 
pointed out the plan of salvation and 
the Church of Christ as it was not then 
found upon the earth, and it cannot be 
successfully attacked by the theologi- 
ans of the world. The only argument 
is the argument used against Christ 
and His disciples—that their characters 
Avere not good. Their characters not 
good! The character of the Smiths not 
good? Where can you And a name 
upon the earth today where the fruits 
brand such a charge more falsely than 
the fruits that have come from the 
loins of the Smiths who were the father 
and the uncles of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. The character of their genera- 
tion brand it as a lie. Not only that, but 
we can hurl it back in their teeth, and 
challenge them to find as good an ab- 
stract of pedigree running down the 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

stream of time as can be found with 
that name. Four hundred thousand 
people know the character of these 
men. And while I am speaking- I see 
two young- men here who have been 
called as special witnesses for the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Start with them; they be- 
long to the two families of the Smiths, 
— the father of the Prophet ^Joseph and 
his brother. Do you know these young 
men? Do you know their lives? And 
do you know their fathers, President 
Joseph F. Smith and Elder John Henry 
Smith, also special witnesses for the 
Lord Jesus Christ? And the brother 
of President Smith, Patriarch John 
Smith — do you know him? Do you 
know the fathers of these mighty men 
— Patriarch Hyrum Smith and the late 
Apostle George A. Smith, a member of 
the First Presidency with President 
Brigham Young? Anything the matter 
with their characters? And the grand- 
father, — the great grandfather of the 
present Elder George A. Smith, — who 
was the Uncle of the Prophet Joseph, 
and who, after the assassination of the 
Patriarch Hyrum Smith remained as 
the Patriarch of the Church — the Pa- 
triarch John Smith — do you know his 
character? We will even go farther 
than that. We will go to those who do 
not belong to the Church, — to the chil- 
dren of the Prophet Joseph Smith who 
are opposing the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. Tell the people 
of the world who charge the Prophet 
Joseph with being a drunkard, a loafer, 
and a dishonest man, that the character 
of the sons of the Prophet himself 
brands the charge as being false, be- 
cause men do not gather figs from this- 
tles nor graces from thorns, nor do 
they expect an impure fountain to send 
forth pure wnter. So far as the char- 
acters of these men are concerned, they 
maintain the testimony which the other 
Smiths maintain concerning the falsity 
of the charges that the Prophet Joseph, 
his father and his father's brothers 
were not sober, industrious and honest 
people. We cannot find such a geneal- 
ogy in any other place on earth. God 
bless the name. God bless the memory 
of the instrument that was chosen by 



the Almighty through whom all these 
mighty truths came to the earth. 

My brothers and sisters, remember 
what the Church has done for you. Do 
you enjoy happy homes? Where did 
you get them 9 Through the instrumen- 
tality of a humble Mormon Elder the 
Church probably found your mother in 
Scandinavia and your father in Eng- 
land. Tt brought them together, and 
was the cause of the marriage between 
them which gave you existence upon 
the earth in a land where it was possi- 
ble for you to enjoy happy homes. And 
what do you owe to the Church? You 
owe everything, even life itself; and 
you should remember that Christ the 
Redeemer has said that if you lose your 
life for His sake you shall find it again, 
even life eternal. I bear testimony that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, 
and that those who have stood at the 
head of the Church from the death of 
the Prophet Joseph up to the present 
time have been and are prophets, seers 
and re vela tors. I bear my testimony to 
tr is.Jn the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
Preservation of Health of Missionaries. 

It may be proper for me to state at 
this time, for the information of the 
Elders, and also for the information of 
the local authorities of the Church, as 
well as the fathers and mothers and 
kindred of the Elders who are out in 
the world preaching the Gospel, that 
the Presidents of all the Missions are 
under strict instructions from the Pres- 
idency of the Church to guard carefully 
the health of the Elders that are labor- 
ing under their direction. These Presi- 
dents of Missions are also under in- 
structions to send home any and all 
Elders whose health or whose other 
circumstances may make it necessavv 
for them to return. We are frequently 
enquired of by parents relative to the 
health of young men who are out 
preaching the Gospel, and we invariably 
inform them that the Presidents of 
Missions are carefully guarding the 
welfare of their sons, and if anything 
serious occurs to them, making it neces- 
sary for them to return home, it will be 
promptly attended to, and they need 



42 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



not worry about their boys on that ac- 
count. And while I am on my feet, I 
would like to exhort the Elders who are 
upon missions, and those who shall go 
upon missions in the future, not to al- 
low the thought to enter their hearts 
that they will be criticised or be made 
to suffer in their character or their 
standing in the Church because their 
health will not permit them to fill a 
two or three years' mission abroad . 
We would like them rather to feel in 
themselves a wholesome aversion to 
coming home without having filled an 
honorable mission, when their health 
and other conditions will permit them 
to do so; and if they have any reluct- 
ance about coming home at all, before 
completing their missions, it should 
be based upon this principle. These 
men that are appointed to preside over 
the missions are men of intelligence and 
of heart, men who are filled with affec- 
tion for their fellow laborers, and they 
will see to it that none of the Elders 
are left in their fields of labor to suf- 
fer, if it can be avoided. So, brethren, 
and sisters, you need not worry at all in 
regard to these matters. 

ELDER ASAHEL H. WOODRUFF 

(Late President of Northern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I have en- 
joyed to the utmost the spirited talk 
delivered by President Rich this morn- 
ing. I only regret that circumstances 
have rendered it impracticable for me 
to attend the previous meetings of this 
glorious conference. I feel greatly the 
need of the faith and prayers of my 
brethren and sisters during the few 
moments I shall address you upon this 
important occasion. As is doubtless 
known to many, it has fallen to my lot 
to have presided for a brief period over 
that important branch of the Lord's 
work known as the Northern States 
mission. In the providence of the Lord 
and as dictated through His servants, 
I have been released from that post 
of duty, after having enjoyed the priv- 
ilege for about thirty-two months. Dur- 
ing the major part of that time I have 
enjoyed greatly my labors. It has given 
me much satisfaction and pleasure to 



know that I enjoyed the confidence of 
my brethren to the extent that they 
were willing to entrust me with that 
important post; and while I felt great- 
ly my inability in many respects to 
fulfill the requirements of the position, 
yet I have tried to perform my labors 
to the best of my ability, and I trust 
with some degree of success. I have 
had the confidence and support of the 
Elders that were appointed to labor 
with me in that part of the Lord's 
vineyard, and I believe that through 
our united efforts some good has been 
accomplished. A great deal of litera- 
ture has been distributed among the 
people who reside in the six States 
that go to make up the Northern 
States mission. During the past two 
years and a half we have distributed 
four hundred thousand tracts and over 
twenty thousand books. We have held 
over ten thousand meetings, and over 
four hundred thousand Gospel conver- 
sations, and striking a fair average of 
five members to each family visited, 
and twenty at each meeting held, we 
believe we have reached four millions 
of people in the Northern States mis- 
sion during that time. Vast as this 
number is, it is but a small part of the 
entire population of those States. When 
we remember that the population of the 
city of Chicago alone is as great as 
the combined population of ten of our 
western States, we can perhaps 
realize the magnitude of the work 
that lies ahead of the small body 
of Elders who are laboring in that field 
at the present time. The people there, 
to a large extent, are not naturally re- 
ligious. Their hearts, in a great meas- 
ure, are set upon the things of this 
world. President Rich uttered a truth 
when he said that the people of the 
south were different in this respect. 
Many of the people of the north, partic- 
ularly in the large cities, do not read 
the Bible to any great extent, and they 
relegate religion to the background. 
They seem to think it is something that 
pertains to women and children and to 
those who are not quite sound in their 
mental faculties. Consequently, we 
have to reason with them upon the

Gospel, and to show them the philoso- 
phy of it; and we do not have more 
people applying for baptism than what 
our Elders can comfortably take care 
of. We rejoice, however, to be able 
to report to our brothers and sisters 
that the work of the Lord is progressing 
in the Northern States, and that the 
baptisms are quite satisfactory. As I 
learn from Elder German E. Ellsworth, 
of Lehi, who has been appointed "to suc- 
ceed me in the presidency of that mis- 
sion, some of the conferences held this 
fall have been unusually successful, one 
particularly, which was held in the 
State of Indiana, in a district which 
has been worked for some time by the 
Elders, and which promised to yield 
fruit. It was decided to hold a confer- 
ence near the town. of Robinson, Greene 
county, Ind. The conference convened 
in a grove, away from any populous 
center. Brother Ellsworth states that 
he did not see two houses together any 
one time, but the woods seemed to turn 
out the people in large numbers, in 
response to our invitation to attend the 
conference; and the interest aroused 
during the first few sessions of the con- 
ference was so great that they felt 
constrained to appoint a time for bap- 
tisms. The conference commenced on 
Saturday, and on the following Wednes- 
day afternoon seven of the leading citi- 
zens of the neighborhood, four men and 
three women, presented tnemselves as 
candidates for baptism. This was fol- 
lowed later by two other baptisms, and 
the total added to the fold during that 
conference was 15. The brethren con- 
tinued the meetings for 14 days, and 
it is stated that there are two or three 
other districts in that state where it is 
believed these results can be duplicated. 

It might be of interest to the Latter- 
day Saints to know that the work 
has been opened up vigorously in Han- 
cock county, State of Illinois — a county 
which suggests so many historic recol- 
lections, some pleasant and some other- 
wise, particularly to the older mem- 
bers of the Church. Two Elders, full 
of faith, hope and courage, and possess- 
ed of proper ability and reliance upon 
the Lord, were sent down to that coun- 



ty some few months ago, without purse 
or scrip, and they were more than suc - 
cessful in reaching the hearts of the 
people and making friends. They wero 
able to hold successful meetings in the 
city of Nauvoo, and in Carthage. Their 
headquarters, at the present time, are 
in the town of Carthage, and it is not 
improbable, if suitable arrangements 
can be made with the Presidency, that 
ere long the Gospel will be preached 
regularly on the Sabbath day in Carth- 
age jail. This is a great reversal of 
conditions as they existed in the for- 
ties, and we feel that the Lord is work- 
ins with the honest in heart in those 
States. 

My brethren and sisters, I want to 
endorse the words spoken by Brother 
Rich in regard to meddling and inter- 
fering with business that properly be- 
longs to the mission on the part of our 
brethren and sisters at home. No doubt 
this is done thoughtlessly in the great 
majority of cases; but we found in the 
Northern States that it was almost im- 
possible to carry out the counsel which 
President F. M. Lyman gave to us as 
he was passing through there sdm;; 
time ago, that we should break up the 
notion in the minds of the Elders that 
a mission was simply for two years, 
by reason of the criticism and interfer- 
ence of those at home. We have en- 
deavored to carry out that idea, and 
have released some brethren even be- 
fore the two year period, because th^y 
were advanced in years and had family 
cares. On the other hand, we have 
tried to keep some younger men who 
were in a position to do us a great deal 
of good; and I want to say that an 
Elder who has served two years, if he 
can be retained in the field for another 
six months, can accomplish about as 
much good during those six months, if 
he will keep up steam, as he could dur- 
ing the previous two years. So we have 
tried to keep some of them two years 
and a half; but in a great majority of 
cases, either their parents, or the Pres- 
ident of the Stake, or others interest- 
ed, have sent for them to come home, 
sometimes we fear without good excuse. 
We believe that when an Elder is sent 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



out into the field he is under 
the direction of the mission 
president, who certainly should 
be entitled to the spirit of his office 
and calling. Jf he does not enjoy the 
inspiration of the Lord to direct him 
in his labors, he is not a suitable per- 
son to be retained in that position, and 
I do not believe the Lord will long re- 
tain him there. I merely mention this 
fact because I sometimes think par- 
ents do not view the matter in a cor- 
rect light. It seems to me that every 
father and mother ought to feel that 
it is an honor conferred upon their son 
if he be retained beyond the usual 
period. It should be an evidence to 
them that he is appreciated and that 
he is of value to the work. 

Through material assistance received 
from the Presidency of the Church, 
there has recently been acquired a 
magnificent church and parsonage in 
the city of Chicago, which will serve 
not only as a meeting place for the 
Saints of that city, but also as head- 
quarters for the Northern States mis- 
sion. It is almost centrally located 
and accessible from all parts of the 
city. The auditorium of the building 
will seat at least five hundred people, 
and is provided with splendid seats of 
walnut, and a fine pipe organ. The 
lower part of the building is divided 
into a chapel room, capable of seating 
some thre hundred people. There is 
also several Sunday School rooms, 
a parson's study, a dining room and 
a kitchen. We feel that this is a very 
valuable acquisition to the mission, and 
will serve to further the work greatly 
in that important metropolis. While 
our meeting place in the past has been 
quite comfortable, it has not altogether 
created a favorable impression upon 
our friends, and I rejoice to learn that 
the attendance has already been great- 
ly augmented through their being priv- 
ileged to meet under more favorable 
conditions. 

I am sure that President Ellsworth 
and the Elders laboring in Chicago will 
be glad to welcome the brethren and 
sisters from Utah who visit that city 
for business or other purposes. Some 



of them make it a point to call on the 
Elders as they pass through. Others, 
however, come and go without showing 
themselves. There are many who are 
in the habit of going there with car- 
loads of cattle and sheep, many of 
whom are actively interested in the 
Lord's work, but they do not always 
bless the Saints with their presence, and 
I am sure the Elders would be 
glad to extend an invitation 
to them to come and listen 
to them, and thereby advance the in- 
terest of the Lord's work. Sometimes 
we have had the privilege of preaching 
to visiting brethren on street corners, 
but we could not get them into the hall. 
I remember last summer I was preach- 
ing on the streets, and there was a 
group of men came along, and I was 
quite surprised to see some of them re- 
move their hats when the opening 
prayer was offered, but I learned at the 
close of the meeting that it was a 
group of our brethren who had come 
down with cattle, and who were on 
their way to the theater, and they 
were attracted by the singing. Some 
of them afterwards remarked that it 
was the first time in their lives that 
they had ever heard the principles of 
the Gospel preached in such plainness. 
I would like our visitors not only to 
come to the street meetings, but to 
the indoor services as well. 

It has been claimed by some mis- 
guided women, particularly one in 
addressing a convention at Denver a 
few days ago, that many of the young 
Latter-day Saints were becoming 
ashamed of the religion of their fath- 
ers. I do know that the young men who 
are preaching the Gospel in the North- 
ern States, are young men of 
courage and conviction, they are fear- 
less and hesitate not to go out upon 
the crowded thoroughfares, though it 
may be necessary at times to go along 
and sing their own songs, hold their 
own services, and they look fearlessly 
into the faces of hundreds of people and 
declarp unto them the pure principles 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What 
is there in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE, 



45- 



the religion of our fathers, to be asham- 
ed of? Surely we need not be ashamed 
that God has been so kind as to bear 
testimony to our souls that He indeed 
does live, that Jesus Christ lives, and 
that He has again spoken from the 
heavens, and recommitted the keys of 
authority and power, by which men 
were authorized to organize His Church 
upon the earth, in all its fullness, in 
the day and time in which we live. 
There is nothing in this to be ashamed 
of. There is nothing in the history of 
our people to be ashamed of. There is 
nothing to be ashamed of in the ma- 
terial progress we have made, by which 
this despised religion has taken the peo- 
ple from a state of dependence, if not 
poverty, in the nations of the earth, 
and placed them in a position of inde- 
pendence, and made them land own- 
ers and householders. I want to tes- 
tify to you that none of the young men 
out in the Northern States mission are 
getting ashamed of their religion, and 
I have failed to find any at home. If 
there are any such, I fear that the 
Lord is as much ashamed of them as 
they are of Him and His work. 

I bear my testimony to the divinity 
of this work. I do know it is God's 
eternal truth restored to the earth. . I 
do know that He raised up His ser- 
vant, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and 
gave him authority to organize His 
Church upon the earth. He fulfilled all 
that was required of him, he laid the 
foundations of this work, and he laid 
them deep, and he laid them well. Af- 
ter him came others who were specially 
qualified for the peculiar work and the 
peculiar conditions that they were re- 
quired to meet in their time. And I 
do testify that we have a Prophet of 
the Lord standing at the head of this 
work at the present time. I pray that 
the blessings of the Lord may be with 
us, that His spirit may fill our hearts, 
and that our first consideration and de- 
sire may always be to labor for the ad- 
vancement of His work upon the earth. 
I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 
(President of Colorado Mission.) 
My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
with you this morning in the opportu- 
nity of meeting in this conference. I 
have enjoyed exceedingly the meetings 
we have had during the past few days 
and the remarks that have been made, 
and I trust that the few moments I 
shall occupy this morning I may be en- 
dowed with the Spirit of our Father in 
heaven, that I may speak unto you that 
which will be of mutual benefit to you 
and myself. I realize that without the 
Spirit of the Lord we are not able to 
accomplish anything pertaining to His 
great work. I have listened w.ith pleas- 
ure to the reports made by our breth- 
ren of the missions which they preside 
over. I suppose that the work in our 
part of the country is similar in many 
respects to that which you have heard. 
We are endeavoring to preach the Gos- 
pel unto the people: but if we are to 
be measured and judged by the number 
of converts, or the baptisms which are 
performed in the Colorado mission, it 
seems to me that our work will appear 
to have been in vain. But we have a 
great many friends. Many of the peo- 
ple in Colorado are friendly to the 
work that we are engaged in. They 
come to us with expressions of friend- 
ship, and they give unto us their aid 
and assistance in every way they pos- 
sibly can. About the only opposition 
we receive in Colorado is from people 
who have come from some other part 
of the country. Brother Woodruff re- 
ferred to remarks that were made in 
Denver a few days ago by some good 
sister. Similar remarks were 

made by people from other parts 
of the country, and not by any 
who live in the state of Colorado. It 
was the national convention of the 
Female society of the Methodist church. 
I went to the president of that society, 
and asked the privilege of presenting 
"Mormonism" before the convention 
from a "Mormon" standpoint, but they 
told me the program was full, and it 
would be impossible to give me any 
time. I felt in this matter like one of 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the brethren said President Woodruff 
felt in relation to the St. George Tem- 
ple. When it was proposed to close 
that Temple, President Woodruff said 
it should remain open so that the peo- 
ple might have an opportunity to do 
their "work, and if they did not do the 
work, then the responsibility would be 
upon them. I felt that we should give 
these people an opportunity to hear the 
Gospel; then if they refused to hear our 
testimony, the sin be upon their heads. 

I notice that this convention resolved 
to stamp out "Mormonism" entirely; 
and I thought while listening to the 
remarks of President Smith, and the 
report which he made of the organiza- 
tion of the Church, what part of this 
great organization are they going to 
begin on with their stamping-out pro- 
cess? And if they should stamp out 
one part of it, what about the other 
parts? How futile are the efforts of 
those who are endeavoring to tear down 
"Mormonism!" Prominent men of 
Colorado and the other States in our 
mission are coming to us voluntarily 
and assuring us that they are our 
friends, and they tell us that we are 
the only religious people in the world 
who are advancing. I can readily be- 
lieve this when I look over this sreat 
sea of faces. I can realize the advance- 
ment this Church has made in the few 
years since it was organized. A few 
days ago I called on my grandmother, 
who is now 86 years of age, and who 
was baptized into the Church in the 
year 1833, and I asked her if she felt 
sorry for having been baptized. She 
said: "No, my son, I have not seen 
one hour of sorrow for it." Although 
she has passed through many trials and 
seen much sorrow in the early historv 
of this Church, being separated from 
her family and driven from one part of 
the country to another, destitute of 
food and clothing on many occasions, 
yet never a day had she felt to regret 
having joined this Church. She said: 
"I know the 'Gospel to be the power of 
God and salvation, not because man 
has told it to me, but through the Spirit 
of my Father in heaven." I feel this 
testimony myself. I know that we are 
engaged in the work of the Lord, and 



I realize that the efforts we are putting 
lorth are yielding fruit. We are reap- 
ing the harvest, not in baptisms per- 
chance, but in the good opinion of the 
thinking men of the world. 

I believe that the great evil of the 
age is the tendency toward infidelity. 
The people of the world are becoming 
impregnated with that spirit to such an 
extent that I fear it may contaminate 
some of those who have taken upon 
themselves to serve the Lord and to 
keep His commandments. I hope it 
will not; but in laboring among the 
people I see so much infidelity that I 
ask myself, how is it possible to keep 
this spirit from spreading among the 
Latter-day Saints? Where we are la- 
boring, many people are becoming dis- 
gusted even with the teaching of the 
Bible. They say that the Bible would 
do for the people who lived ages ago, 
and .didn't know any better, but we 
have gone past those things now. 
I!; makes me wonder whether or not this 
spirit is getting among the Latter-day. 
Saints, but I do pray it will not. 

We are striving in our mission to 
have the Elders who go there become 
thoroughly acquainted with the princi- 
ples of the Gospel. We are trying to 
keep them at work, realizing that so 
long as they are working and striving 
every day to preach the Gospel and 
to bear their testimony, the Lord will 
be with them, and will strengthen the 
testimony which they already have. I 
believe we have as good a lot of Elders 
and sister missionaries in our mission 
field as can be found in any part of the 
world. They are working zealously 
and earnestly for the advancement of 
truth, and you do not need to have 
one moment of worry regarding their 
condition. You need not trouble as to 
whether they are sick, or whether they 
will be sent home before their time, or 
whether they will be kept longer than 
their time. We have determined to 
keep an Elder in the mission field as 
long as the Spirit of the Lord directs. 
We have Elders now who have been 
there from thirty to thirty-three 
months, and they may be there thirty- 
six or forty months, before, they return 
home. We do not want them to come 



ELDER REED SMOOT. 



47 



home, for we feel that they are accom- 
plishing a great amount of good. In 
some instances, while they may not be 
accomplishing much good for others, 
they are doing a great amount of good 
to themselves. ■ While they may not be 
baptizing many, they are becoming 
thoroughly imbued with the spirit of 
the Gospel and receiving the testimony 
of Jesus Christ for themselves, and 
when they return to their homes they 
will be in a position to do you and the 
great work in which they are engaged 
more good than if they were to return 
at an earlier period. The Elders should 
remain in the mission field until those 
who preside over them feel that they 
should return. This is the policy we 
have been endeavoring to carry out. 
We have tried to, show the Elders that 
their mission is not for any stated peri- 
od of time, but they are to remain until 
they receive their release, and they will 
receive their release just as soon as the 
Spirit of the Lord indicates that it 
should be given. 

We who are laboring in the Colorado 
mission, love the word of the Lord, 
and we love to bear our testimony. The 
Elders have borne testimony upon 
many of the street corners of the cities 
and towns of the Colorado mission. In 
the little towns and hamlets they have 
gone into the streets on Saturday af- 
ternoon, when the people have gath- 
ered to do their shopping, and they 
have found there congregations of four 
and five hundred people who have stood 
and listened to them while they 
preached the Gospel. It was rather a 
new thing to some of the Elders to hold 
meetings on the streets in the after- 
noon, but we have found it has done a 
great deal of good and has opened a 
great many doors to the Elders. And 
while the people in this mission were 
hospitable before, and took the Elders 
in and gave unto them everything 
necessary to their comfort, we feel that 
these street meetings have resulted in 
much good, in allaying prejudice, and 
in various other ways. May the Lord 
bless us and help us to be faithful and 
to do His will continually, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER REED SMOOT. 

A good word to the Young— Importance of 
enlarging home ludustries. 

It gives me great pleasure, my dear 
brethren and sisters, to have the priv- 
ilege of speaking a few minutes to this 
vast congrgation of Latter-day Saints. 
I am proud indeed to hear the reports 
that have been given and the testi- 
monies that have been borne this morn- 
ing by three presidents of missions, and 
to partake of the Spirit of this confer- 
ence. I know they are interested in 
your sons, and in the great missionary 
work of the Church. I feel to say, 
thank God for them and their labors. 

Our enemies would very much appre- 
ciate the claim, if it were true, that 
many of our young people are asham- 
ed of the Gospel of Jesus Clirist. But 
in my travels among our people, and 
in coming in contact with the young 
people in our meetings, I can testify 
to you that instead of being ashamed 
of the great work, they are proud of the 
fact that they are members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. They are proud of their fath- 
ers and of their mothers. I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, for I do know that it is 
the power of God unto salvation; and 
I hope I may never live long enough 
to be ashamed of the Gospel, or of the 
devotion that my father and my moth- 
er gave to this great work. I only hope 
that I shall have that same fidelity, 
that same love, and that same confi- 
dence in the work of God that they 
had; that I shall, at all times, have 
sufficient of the Spirit of God to enable 
me, if it became necessary, to give all 
on earth for its advancement, as I 
know that the father and mother who 
gave me life would have done any min- 
ute after they were baptized into this 
church. 

There are many things that the 
Apostles of the Church speak of at the 
iifferent quarterly conferences pertain-

ing to the welfare of the people and 
properly so. As I visit the different 
sections of our State, and see pros- 
perity on all hands, I thank our heav- 
enly Father that the people are so well 
provided with comfortable homes, 
happy surroundings, and loving- chil- 
dren, and while I know that there is 
very little suffering among the Saints 
of God, yet, as I travel from one end of 
the state to the other and mingle with 
the people, I can plainly see in dif- 
ferent localities that there are many 
natural advantages that are not made 
the best use of by our people. At the 
earnest request of the presidency of the 
St. George stake of Zion, I took a trip 
rcently through that stake for the pur- 
pose of seeing if the conditions.were fa- 
vorable for the re-establishment of an 
industry by which a part of the woolen 
goods used by the southern people could 
be manufactured at Washington, Utan, 
This state had for its emblem 
the beehive, which means in- 
dustry, frugality gathering for 
future need. Would that we 
all might incorporate its meaning into 
our lives. Tn years past that great 
aj ostle of home manufacture, President 
Brigham Young, taught very strongly 
from one end of the land to the other, 
the duty and principle of making what 
we wear and raising what we eat. You 
can go into many of our communities 
and you will find the result of his 
teachings in different kinds of factories 
and mills, but I am sorry to say that 
almost every woolen mill in the state 
is closed today, with the machinery 
not only lying idle, but going to rack 
and ruin. Then again we can go into 
the different counties of Utah and see 
hundreds of car loads of fruit rotting 
and going to waste. 

It seems to kip, for want of proper 
care and lack of means to preserve the 
same, we are neglecting one of the 
great cardinal principles of prosperity, 
that has been taught to us by President 
Young and all of his successors, that of 
loyalty to home manufactured goo:!*. 
The trouble is we have forgotten the 
great principle of co-operation by which 
the mill and factory in our early his- 



tory were established. And why is 
this? I rather think that one of the 
causes is loss of confidence in one an- 
other's ability to make money in manu- 
facturing institutions. Perhaps one 
reason is because there have been a few 
failures and a loss of means in some of 
these undertakings. But I believe that 
if the people today would be as loyal to 
the great principle of home manufacture 
as they were when these institutions 
were established, not only those which 
we have in our midst would be running, 
but many others would be started. If 
the men associated with the institutions 
that have been established in the past 
ir. different parts of Utah, would only 
get together, and if the men of means 
wculd join with them and furnish 
enough money to resuscitate these in- 
dustries, and all work upon the princi- 
ple of sustaining home institutions, I 
am satisfied, that we would grow in our 
material interests much faster than we 
have in the past. 

I also find in traveling around, that 
there is a lack of interest among the 
people in providing work for their chil- 
dren, and many of them are idle. I 
have noticed, too, that many of our 
young people are becoming professional 
idlers. If there is any one thing that, 
will bring trouble to the children of the 
Batter-day Saints more than another it 
is to raise them up in idleness; for an 
idle brain is the devil's workshop. I 
tell you, my brethren and sisters, we 
ought to provide some means of em- 
ployment for our young people, and 
teach them in their youth to be indus- 
trious and avoid the crime of idleness. 
The proper time to correct this evil is 
now. Upon the great face of the world's 
time piece is only written one word, 
and that is NOW. I hope and trust 
that where we see the great blessings 
which our Heavenly Father showers up- 
on the people going to waste upon this 
hand and upon the other, we will be in- 
terested enough to get together, and 
men who have been blessed of God with 
means, utilize their means in starting 
some kind of industry that will em- 
ploy our young people. I know that if 
we will do this and the people be loyal

in their support, numerous industries 
can be established and made a success. 
It is almost a shame to think of the 
number of factories that have, been 
started in Utah in the shape of woolen 
mills and only one running — a mill at 
Provo, running night and day, and 
ninety per cent of all its products go- 
ing to eastern markets! It did not use 
to be that way, and it should not be 
now. Many of our people are restless, 
.and some of the younger men, and some 
of the older ones, too, are moving away 
in search of new homes, claiming lack 
of opportuntiy to make a liv- 
ing. I tell you that there axe 
just as good advantages and 
as many of them right within the 
borders of our own state, if they are 
only utilized, as you will find most 
anywhere in this country. Do not get 
discouraged, and do not leave your 
homes, but make use of the advantage? 
around you. I have seen lately many 
who have sold their homes to go to dif- 
ferent localities, and they have spent 
most of the money in trying to get 
located, and now they are coming back 
to where they went from, not as wei. 
off as when they went, and without any 
home, and most of the means gone. 

I have in mind now many industries 
that could be started in different parts 
of the State, and should be by men who 
have the interest of the people at heart. 
I ask the leading men of our communi- 
ties to take an interest in this par- 
ticular direction, and see if they cannot 
find something to do for all our boys, 
and for the idle men, if there are any. 
I suggested the other day to the Com- 
mercial Club of Provo that it would be 
a very good thing for them to appoint 
a committee to visit every locality in 
Utah, and even beyond the borders of 
our own State, and see what was being 
done in other localities by way of manu- 
facturing industies, and returning 
study the natural resources of our city, 
and see if they could not be converted 
into something that we must have and 
for which we are now sending our 
means out of the State. I believe it 
would be a good thing, whenever men 
travel from one place to another, to 



learn of the successful manufacturing 
establishments, and perhaps they might 
find something that would be of ad- 
vantage to the people where they are 
located. If these things are looked 
after, I believe greater prosperity will 
be brought to the people than they 
have enjoyed in the past. 

My brethren and sisters, I ask God's 
blessings upon us as a people, and upon 
all that we undertake to do in right- 
eousness, that we may be successful. 
That His blessings may ever attend us, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus'. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Arous, c , 
O ye Mortals." 

Eenediction was pronounced by Elder 
Joseph W. McMurrin of the seven presi- 
dents of Seventies. 

OVERFLOW MEETING. 

At the overflow meeting in the As- 
sembly Hall Sunday afternoon, the au- 
dience filled every available seat. 
Apostle Rudger Clawson called the 
meeting to order promptly at 2 o'clock, 
after which the Temple choir and audi- 
ence sang, "Now let us rejoice in the 
day of Salvation." Prayer was offered 
by President James E. Steele of Bing- 
ham stake; followed by the Temple 
choir singing the Harvest Anthem, "Te 
shall dwell in the land." 

ELDER NEPHI PRATT, 

(President of Northwestern States Mis- 
sion.) 

My brethren and sisters, I am very 
grateful to be accounted worthy to oc- 
cupy this position in this great assem- 
blage this afternoon. I rise before 
you, as other Elders do, with much fear 
and trembling; but I am grateful to 
the Lord, nevertheless, that I am ac- 
counted worthy to be a member in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. My spirit will, throughout the 
endless ages of eternity, continue 
thankful for the conditions which have 
surrounded me in mortal life. I thought 
this morning, while listening to certain 
remarks of our brethren in this con- 
ference, that if I could see my own 
father and mother again, with the un- 
derstanding that I have now, I could 
almost bow down and worship them. I 
am thankful that my father was a 
seeker after truth, that he hungered af-

ter righteousness, and that he lived in 
a generation when the Lord had again 
established His work on the earth with 
authority and with power. In the souls 
of my mother and my father were im- 
planted desires that finally led them to 
receive the Gospel of the Son of God, 
in its purity. I have sought for many 
years to correct the frailties of my 
life, that I might be accounted worthy 
in the hereafter, when I have laid by 
mortality, and gone into the spirit 
world, to associate with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, with my father and oth- 
er Prophets, Priests and kings that 
have been raised up from this people 
and saved in the celestial kingdom of 
our God. Gold and silver, houses and 
lands, and all that beautifies and en- 
riches the eafrth, and gladdens the 
heart, all that we call wealth in the 
earth, Ave ought to consider as dross 
compared to the excellency of the 
knowledge and spirit of this work. 
When the Spirit of the Lord comes up- 
on a man, and he is performing the 
duties that the Lord has called him to 
do, he receives the revelations of Jesus 
Christ, when he goes to the Lord and 
seeks to know how to fulfill the duties 
of his high and holy calling. The still 
small voice will come to a man or to a 
woman, in the positions they occupy in. 
the family or in the Priesthood. No per- 
son can stand between woman, child, or 
man and their God in this Church. We 
are dependent upon the words of no 
individual, nor the testimony of any 
person in the world. No man's ability 
is so great, and never has been, no 
matter what may be said about the 
greatness of our leaders, that could 
ever accomplish what has been done in 
this generation. No man could have 
established this work, much less an un- 
informed boy. This work was estab- 
lished by the Lord. 

In the mission where I am called to 
labor the Elders are hunting diligently 
for good souls that will listen to their 
testimony. These Elders almost cry 
with joy when they get a few investi- 
gators that accord them the privilege 
of stating the mission God has sent 
them to perform. We realize the value 



of the souls of men and women. When 
we find the door of a house opened 
to us, and the hearts of the people 
softened sufficiently that they give us 
food and shelter, we begin then to pray 
for that household. We beseech the 
Lord, in the name of Jesus that has 
called us into the work of God, to 
bless that man and his house, and to 
bless his wife and children, that they 
may have the testimony that this is 
the work of God come unto them from 
God the Eternal Father. Our Elders 
visit them as often as it is wise to do 
so. They continue to pray for them 
and speak upon the principles of 
truth and righteousness ' as frequently 
as the spirit that is in the Elders 
tells them will be proper to do in that 
house, earnestly desiring to save 
souls. 

I have thought in my cogitations in 
the missionary field, many a time, 
how careless I have been, in the years 
that are passed, about the soul, of my 
neighbor, here in Zion. How much 
did I seek as a teacher in the church, 
sent around the block, to teach the 
people, cultivate the garden of the 
Lord, and save the souls of my 
brethren? The missionary work I 
am doing abroad has shown me that 
my soul was not sufficiently in the 
work when I was at home. The cares 
of my family, financial affairs and 
other things constrained me, so that 
when I went out among the people I 
wanted to hurry from family to fam- 
ily, but now the souls of men are 
precious to me. It seems to me I never 
will again on the earth be indifferent 
to the soul of any man, because all are 
the children of God. 

The Elders in my mission are about 
40 in number, all faithful and true, 
some of them of fine ability. Some of 
you will wonder at your sons when 
they return from that mission. If 
they seem improved to you, if they 
ccme back converted to the Gospel, 
>ou may know that they had to re- 
sist the powers of evil, and overcome 
the world. They now appreciate 
privileges that they had never ac- 
cepted when they were at home. O 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 



you young people in the Church of 
God, you that are in theological 
classes in Sunday schools, who study 
the Gospel, that is contained in the 
Book of Mormon and the Bible, be- 
cause you have been exhorted to do 
so, but sit like dummies upon your 
seats when asked to answer questions, 
how shall you face the people of the 
world when you are sent on missions? 
If you won't get up where there is a 
small class all in sympathy with you, 
because your heart beats and fails you 
at the time, what shall you do when 
you go out on the street corner and 
face a congregation of from one doz- 
en to five hundred, all of whom 
hope to see you fail, and would not 
give you God-speed if they could 
help it? Now, if it almost breaks 
your heart to practice a little in the 
Sunday schools and Mutual Improve- 
ment associations, if it blanches your 
cheeks and sets your heart fluttering 
till you almost faint, that is the place 
to begin, so that when you go out into 
the world you won't be humiliated 
because you did not improve the op- 
portunities that were offered to you 
at home. 

It is not all pleasantness in the mis- 
sionary field. Doors are slammed in oui 
faces by the wicked and indifferent. 
If they see a long tail coat at the door, 
they say to their servants, "Shut the 
door as quick as you can without being 
impolite." It would surprise you to 
hear the first discourses of your boys; 
they fail because they would not do 
the things that were required of them 
at home. But they go to the Lord after 
failure, and cry unto Him, and say, 
"Father, I knew that I was remiss, I 
know that I didn't do the things I 
should have done at home, I see now 
what I have lost; I am no credit to the 
Church that thou hast established in 
the earth, but bear with me, my Father, 
and have mercy upon me." The young 
Elder then goes out, and the Lord hav- 
ing mercy upon him, he begins to 
speak, the power of God falls upon 
him, and he is lifted above himseli. 
Sometimes, when a few blessings of this 
kind fall upon the young man, his head 



swells, and he says to himself, Now I 
can do it, I will preach on the corner, 
on such and such a principle. He goes 
there, and, in order that the Lord may 
teach him that he is nothing, but that 
the Lord is all in all, the Spirit is 
withheld from him, and he experiences 
another failure. He learns then how 
powerless he is, and says, "I am noth- 
ing, but the Lord God is all in all," and 
confesses his weakness. By and by, 
when he comes home, you say that it is 
as though a miracle had been pei- 
formed upon him. Well, you did not 
see his struggles, you did not see what 
made him the man that he is. It was 
the humiliation that he got in the field, 
and the efforts that he made. If 
he sticks to the faith, an} 
don't go back to his old-time hab- 
its, I will tell you what he will be 
in the future: He will be a man that 
will never again think "I am every- 
thing." He will be always ready to say, 
It is God that accomplishes these 
things; it was the Lord that did this, 
and the Lord that did the other; and 
he will never ascribe the success of 
this work to the hand of any man. 

God bless the people; bless the fruits 
of this conference; comfort the servants 
of God; and may the work of the Lord 
roll forth in majesty and power greater 
than it ever has since the beginning. I 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 
(Acting President Northern States 
Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, I desire that 
you should offer in my behalf a sol- 
emn prayer, that the man-fearing spirit 
that sometimes comes upon the Elders, 
when appearing before the Saints, may 
be taken from me a short time, while I 
report the condition of the mission 
known as the Northern States. This 
man-fearing spirit does not bother the 
Elders as much before an audience in 
the world as it does before an audience 
of Latter-day Saints. Here we are 
conscious that the majority of the audi- 
ence, if not all, understand the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel as well as we; but 
when appearing before the world, we

know that we have something new to 
tell, we know that we have been sent 
with the message of life and salva- 
tion to declare unto them, and God has 
blessed us and sent us forth, and we 
feel if we are humble that we can tell 
the people something. If the Latter- 
day Saints were not possessed of the 
Spirit of the Lord, if they did not come 
seeking the truth of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, they would go from the meet- 
ings dissatisfied with that which had 
been spoken in their hearing. The 
Latter-day Saints, when they come to- 
gether, and listen to the principle of 
faith, or repentance, or baptism, or the 
Holy Ghost, or any one of the simple 
principles of the Gospel declared by 
the Elders, if in possession of the Spirit 
of God, that spirit manifests unto them 
that which is satisfying to the soul. I 
have heard testimonies concerning reve- 
lations of God given unto different 
people in the audience while some hum- 
ble Elder was speaking concerning the 
restoration of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. And that one thing gives me 
hope in attending meetings, no matter 
who the speaker is, if my heart is right, 
God will bless me according to my de- 
sires, and I go away built up in faith 
and strengthened in the testimony of 
Jesus. I feel in listening to sermons 
that have been delivered in this con- 
ference and the reports of the differ- 
ent missions, that we have heard no 
new nor startling doctrines, but be- 
cause of the Spirit that has been with 
us, many thousands of hearts, I know, 
will go from this conference feeling that 
it is good to have assembled together 
as a body of Latter-day Saints. It is 
good to have had the privilege of list- 
ening to the servants of the Lord, and 
opening' our hearts and minds to the 
revelations that God bestows upon the 
earnest seeker. I rejoice to have the 
privilege, after 16 months, of again as- 
sembling with the Saints, and under 
the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, 
feast upon the good things of our Fa- 
ther's kingdom. 

Two years ago, nearly, when I was 
called to go upon a mission, friends 
reminded me that I had only been 



home a short time, and that there were 
other men who were financially better 
qualified to go than I was. I stated, 
when Apostle Cowley asked me if I 
would go upon a mission, that I had 
been home only a little over four years. 
He told me he didn't care if I had 
been home only four weeks, "it is the 
will of the Lord that you go upon a 
mission." I was unknowingly trying 
to prevent the fulfilment of a prophecy 
that was made that I would go upon 
a mission again within five years from 
the time I returned from my first mis- 
sion. Now I am thankful to my Father 
in heaven I decided that I would go. 
The way was opened up whereby I have 
had the glorious privilege of being 
again associated with the missionaries 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. They are a grand and 
noble body of men laboring in the 
Northern states. 

We have in that mission at the pres- 
ent time a few less than 100 Elders, 
and if those who have been there two 
years, or near that time, were released 
we should have less than 75. The mis- 
sion is so good that we are at least 50 
or 75 short of the number that we could 
use conveniently. When we landed in 
the mission, I found President Asahel 
H. Woodruff was devoted to labor, la- 
bor, labor. Once while taking lessons 
in penmanship, my teacher told me he 
would give me three rules that would 
make me a good penman if I followed 
them. Those three rules were: Practice 
intelligent practice, and intelligent 
earnest practice. The life of our presi- 
dent, who has been in the Northern 
States mission for the last two years 
and a half, has been one of labor, earn- 
est labor, earnest intelligent, diligent 
labor. He has sought, night and day. 
to instil that into the hearts of every 
one of the Elders there, for he realized, 
and often said to them, that if they 
would labor earnestly and diligently for 
the Lord their hearts would be opened 
and their minds quickened with the 
revelations cf our Father, and they 
would be able to speak unto the peo- 
ple. When he has taught the young 
Elder to labor, and to love the souls of 



ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH.

men, they have begun to develop and 
seek diligently to find somebody to 
preach the Gospel to. This summer, 
many of our young men have not been 
satisfied to go upon the streets in 
company with three or four others, but 
were ready to avail themselves of every 
opportunity to preach the Gospel on 
street corners by themselves; and being 
alone, in humility have gone before the 
people and preached night after night. 
We have several that I could mention 
in particular who have, this summer, 
gone as often as 25 times alone upon 
the streets of Chicago, and proclaimed 
the Gospel. Last year, with the excep- 
tion of three or four instances, we had 
no success upon the streets in the city 
of Chicago. Thousands of the people 
received our tracts, and' went on with- 
out stopping to hear us. This year, we 
selected three corners, and appointed 
two Elders for each to hold meeting 
there every night that weather permit- 
ted. I am pleased to report that, at 
two of the corners selected, we have a 
standing congregation of from 40 to 
100 people every night, when the wea- 
ther is favorable. If we fail to come, 
the people are disappointed. Now the 
weather is beginning to get cold, we 
have as many at 25 people who attend 
our hall meetings, as a result of meet- 
ings held on one corner selected early 
in the spring. 

I rejoice in the work of the Lord, and 
I rejoice in the testimonies that He 
has given to the Elders in the Northern 
states. Most of us are young, and we 
desire to do the will of the Lord, for 
we have no other purpose in view while 
abiding in those cold and barren states, 
where there are but few of the honest 
in heart, considering the many millions 
of people 

I desire to tell one circumstance, my 
brethren and sisters, that shows there 
is still faith in the earth. We were fa- 
vored with a visit, about three weeks 
ago from Apostle George A. Smith 
And President Asahel H. Woodruff, 
and, on the Sabbath day they were 
there a little girl, who had heard of the 
power of God that was in the Church, 
but had never seen an Elder, asked 
her mother if she could come to meet- 



ing and be blessed by the Elders, be- 
lieving that she would be healed. The 
little girl was 11 years of age, and 
when she was only about 4 years of 
age, her father, who was a drunk- 
ard, came home and threw her 
across the room. The result was that 
one leg was disabled, and for six years 
she had worn a steel frame around her 
body, never taking it off, and it had 
formed hard sores upon her. She came 
to the meeting and was administered 
unto according to her request. During 
the night she heard a voice telling her 
to take off that frame, and she did so. 
She then went to her mother's room 
and said that the Lord had healed her. 
One of her legs has increased two or 
three inches in length; it is still a little 
shorter than the other now, but God 
healed her through the power of faith. 
We could tell you many other things the 
Lord has done for the honest in heart. 
He has blessed the Elders with the 
spirit of humility. He has blessed them 
also with a testimony of the Gospel, 
and with a love for the souls of their 
fellow men. 

There is a sect in the Northern States 
known as the Dowieites, and they are 
teaching faith in God, and repentance, 
very vigorously; they are also teaching 
baptism for the remission of sins. They 
are practising "the word of wisdom;" 
and in their city of 10,000 people there 
is not a place where you can buy liquor, 
nor tobacco, nor a piece of swine flesh. 
A number of these people, within the 
last month or two, have testified in 
our meetings, and applied for baptism, 
who were brought to believe on the 
Lord Jesus Christ through Dowie's 
preaching. If they have been brought 
to believe on the name of Jesus Christ 
through this man, he has done that 
much good. I believe it is a glorious 
thing to be born in a Christian country, 
and be taught to believe in the name of 
Jesus Christ, no matter what denomin- 
ation one may belong to, it is that much 
in favor of leading us to the true church 
of Christ. We are watching that people, 
and think it probable that in the course 
of a few years the honest in heart 
among them will accept the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I pray that God will bless us all, that 
we may open our hearts and desire to 
know the will of God; that we may 
gain from the many good things 
said here that which shall comfort 
our souls, that we may go 
away built up in faith, and with 
love toward our fellow men throughout 
all the earth. We ought to teach our 
young men, all of them, to open their 
hearts, for the young man who cannot 
pray to his Father in heaven in earnest 
will never convert a soul in the world. 
He must love the souls of men, ho 
must open his heart in prayer, in song, 
and in earnest speech before he can 
impress the people that he believes 
what he is saying. 

May God help us all to be true to the 
covenants we have made to uphold 
and sustain the laws of God upon the 
earth, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly, my 
brethren and sisters, in the meetings 
of this conference, and in the testimo- 
nies that have been borne as to the di- 
vinity of the work in which we are en- 
gaged. I might say that I have teen 
specially pleased with the reports that 
have come from the mission fields. It 
has brought to us the missionary spirit 
that we all admire so much in our 
young men when they return to our 
midst. I also rejoice in the Gospel it- 
self, the principles which have been re- 
vealed by our Father in heaven for the 
salvation of His children; and I feel a 
deep interest in spreading abroad 
among the nations of the earth a 
knowledge of the Gospel that our Fath- 
er has restored to the earth in the day 
and age in which we live. 

In the remarks of Brother Asahel 
Woodruff, in the tabernacle, this morn- 
ing, he stated that the people, or a 
great many of them, had ceased to re- 
gard the Bible as any particular au- 
thority, and in presenting the Gospel it 
was necessary to show them its philos- 
ophy. They are no longer content to 
accept of a faith because it harmonizes 
with the revealed word of God, it must 



be presented to them in a form that 
will appeal to their reason. In other 
words, they must have religion present- 
ed to them scientifically before they will 
accept it. 

My brethren and sisters, the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ is a scientific religion; 
it is based upon eternal principles of 
truth, and truth is science. I thought 
while he was speaking this morning, 
how natural it is that men and women 
should be saved through the operations 
of that only true Gospel, which our 
Father has revealed; and how natural 
are the principles that have been re- 
vealed to us, and how they appeal to 
the reason of intelligent men and wo- 
men. There are many scientific truths 
stated in the Bible, but none of them 
any more scientific than this, that 
"This is Eternal Life to know Thee, 
the true and living God and Jesus 
Christ whom Thou hast sent." It re- 
quires only a little reflection to come to 
the conclusion that it is so in very 
deed. Every man and woman must 
recognize the fact that we are sur- 
rounded by influences that are abroad 
in the world. There is one power and 
influence that is endeavoring to elevate 
and exalt mankind; it is the Spirit of 
God that issues forth from His pres- 
ence, and is bestowed upon all those 
who diligently seek Him. If we lend a 
willing ear to the whisperings of the 
still small voice it will lead us to works 
of righteousness. 

There is also another influence that is 
abroad in the land, and everywhere felt 
among the children of men, that is 
leading downward, and if we harken to 
that voice it will lead us to destruc- 
tion. Have you never felt the power 
of these influences working upon you? 
Does it need to be proven to you as in- 
dividuals that these influences are 
abroad in the world? Have they not 
come under your own observation? Ev- 
ery man and woman should say, Yes, 
I have felt them for myself. On the 
one hand we listen to the Spirit of God; 
we hearken to His voice, and it leads 
us to the doing of those things tJz&t 
are in harmony with the will of the 
Father; it causes our hearts to be filled 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



with joy, it teaches us to love our 
neighbor, to be honest, to be truthful, 
tao live a godly life and to keep our- 
selves unspotted from the sins of the 
world. On the other hand, if we listen 
to the evil power (which is just as much 
a reality as the existence of that good 
power and influence), if we hearken to 
that, it will lead us to the doing of those 
things that are evil, it will teach us to 
cheat our neighbor, to lie and steal, and 
will lead us down into' the depths of 
misery; it will lead us into a life of de- 
bauchery crime and sin. The reason 
we find men both good and bad is be- 
cause these influences are abroad in the 
world. 

There is another scientific statement 
recorded in the Scripture, which says: 
"There is a spirit in man, and the in- 
spiration of the Almighty giveth him 
understanding." The spirit that be- 
longs to us, that gives animation to 
our bodies, is subject to these in- 
fluences, and the Spirit of God will 
give unto us understanding; it will 
give unto us knowledge; it will bring 
us unto God. It is also true that the 
evil spirit will darken our minds, and 
rob us of the understanding we ought 
to have. These are realities, my 
brethren and sisters. We are in the 
midst of them, for these powers and 
these influences are operating upon the 
minds of the children of men. Blessed 
is he whose soul yearns to be guided 
and directed by the Spirit of God. Hap- 
py is he if he lends a willing ear to 
the good influence that is trying to 
purify and save his soul. But un- 
fortunate and unhappy is he who yields 
to the power and influence of the ad- 
versary. 

When Paul was preaching this Gos- 
pel of the kingdom in Athens, he found 
the people in ignorance. They had 
been worshiping false gods. They had 
been offering their devotions to Miner- 
va, the goddess of wisdom, and to Nep- 
tune, the god of the sea, to Mars, the 
god of war, and many other false dei- 
ties whom they were worshiping. But 
among that people were some who be- 
gan to yearn after the true and living 
God. They knew that there was an- 



other power. Their own observation 
had convinced them of that, so they 
undertook to erect an altar in His hon- 
or, and upon that altar they inscribed 
the words, "To the unknown God." 
Paul took that inscription for his theme 
and text, and he said, "Him whom ye 
ignorantly worship, him declare I unto 
you." Later on he admonished them 
that they should "Seek the Lord if hap- 
ly they mierht feel after Him and find 
him, though he be not far distant from 
every one of us, for in him we live 
and move and have our being." He 
proclaimed the existence of the Spirit 
of God that issued forth from the pres- 
ence of the Father, and is everywhere 
to be found. I know that the passage 
I quoted in the first place is pretty 
thoroughly understood by the Latter- 
day Saints, that this is eternal life, 
this is salvation, that we may learn 
to know the Lord. Then it ought to 
be in a plan of salvation that is scienti- 
fic in its nature, that men and women 
may be brought to the knowledge of 
God, because that is eternal life. The 
way to obtain that knowledge, then, is 
to get the Spirit of God, because no man 
knoweth the things of God but by the 
Spirit of God that is in him. Any plan 
which has for its purpose the bringing 
of men and women to that knowledge 
must indeed be founded upon scientific 
principles. The Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is peculiarly adapted to the acquisi- 
tion of that knowledge. Its foundation 
is laid upon a knowledge of that theme, 
upon an understanding of that princi- 
ple. When you see a man or a woman 
hearken to the still small voice, endeav- 
oring io do right and to learn and lean 
upon the influence that is uplifting, 
and which is everywhere inducing men 
and women to be better, their hearts 
go out to that power and influence. And 
what is ii? It is faith in God, the true 
and living God. Our hearts go out to 
Him. It is a natural principle that 
causes us to lean to the good influence, 
to lend a willing ear and to seek after 
Him, whom to know is life eternal. 
Not satisfied with the false gods that 
are in this world, our hearts yearned

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for the true and living God. That is 
faith; a natural principle. 

In order that we may come to a 
knowledge of God, that the Lord may 
be pleased to draw nigh unto us, and 
that we may be qualified to receive an 
additional outpouring of that Holy 
Spirit, what are we to do? We must 
■set ourselves in order, forsake our evil 
ways, and put ourselves in harmony 
with the Good Spirit that is leading us 
upward. That is repentance, another 
natural law, without which we cannot 
come to a full kno»wledge of God. 

What else do we yearn for? Forgive- 
ness of sin, that we might stand clean 
before the throne of God, and be quali- 
fied to receive additional light which 
comes from the Spirit of God. Baptism 
is natural, too. I thank God that He 
established this ordinance, and put this 
law in His Church, that we may be 
washed free from sin, and be prepared 
to receive His Holy Spirit. 

What else is there in this Gospel that 
is natural and scientific? Why, the ob- 
taining of this Spirit; and God has in- 
stituted an ordinance that it might be 
conferred upon us by His divine author- 
ity, the ordinance of laying on of hands, 
that we might receive the Spirit of God. 
These are some of the principles that 
constitute truly scientific religion. 

Some say, "I am not going to exercise 
faith; I want to have things proven to 
me first." You have got to manifest 
faith in God, or you will give evidence 
of being on the side of Satan, just 
as sure as you live. You have got to 
lend your ear to the Spirit of God, or 
you will hearken to the spirit of the 
adversary, who is trying to drag you 
down. These are the influences that 
are abroad in the world. They are 
realities, and you know it, every one 
of you. You cannot ignore the power 
of God. The Spirit of God is striving 
among the children of men, to lift them 
up and bless those that will hearken. 
And the spirit of evil is trying to drag 
you down, striving with you and seek- 
ing your destruction, just as sure as 
you are living here today. Satan has 
a very evil power, a very evil influence, 
a very evil name, and his name Is 
adapted to his character. Did you ever 



stop to analyze it? Let me just point 
out a few things to you about this evil 
spirit that is abroad in the world, that 
I may emphasise the character of the 
being who is trying to destroy youi 
souls. We call him the devil. Just im- 
agine his name as being written upon 
the wall here. It is bad in all its parts: 
Strike off the d, and it is evil, and that 
is bad; strike off the e and it is vile; 
strjke of the v and it is il 
(ill), and that is bad, too; then 
strike off the i, and give it a little 
English accent, and it is hell! And 
that is just where he will take you, if 
you listen to his voice. Let us then 
seek the Spirit of God, and believe In 
this natural religion which God has* 
revealed for the savation of the chil- 
dren of men. Amen. 

J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 
I feel a good deal, at this time, as the 
chaplain did in one of the Utah Leg- 
islative assemblies when my father put 
him on oath. Father was a little ac- 
quainted with him. They had crossed 
the plains together, and father knew 
what a long and tedious prayer he 
usually offered, so father said, 
"Will you pray briefly and to the 
point." Well now, I feel that I will 
have to talk briefly and to the point. I 
trust that, through the inspiration of 
the Holy Spirit, I may make myself 
clear, for sometimes on these occasions 
we go down on record, that is, what 
we say is placed in print Now I am not 
fearful to open my' mouth, and endea- 
vor to use the time profitably which the 
Lord has given me I have lived in this 
Church long enough to know something 
about it, and I don't have to go to 
strangers to ask them anything about 
this work, and I don't propose to accept 
their statements, unless they are har- 
monious with my views. 

I was born in this Church, and I 
thank God for it. It comprises every- 
thing that is good, everything that is 
pure, everything that is elevating, not- 
withstanding all that is said against 
it. 

I can tell my history in a few min- 
utes; if I stood before the bar of God 
tomorrow, and the Lord asked we what 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL. 



57 



I had been doing, I could tell him in a 
very few words. For 15 years of my life, 
I was disciplined and instructed by my 
father, which has been an anchor to 
my soul. The things I was taught in 
my childhood (father died when I was 
15 years old.) have been the savor of 
life to my soul; and the Holy Ghost has 
brought it to my remembrance. For 
12 years of my life, after his death, I 
was as free as the birds that fly in the 
»ir; there was no restraint further 
than the counsel from my mother.I took 
no active part in the Church. I was 
just as free as non-members of the 
Church feel that they are free. That 
is a part of my history I am not mak- 
ing much noise about; I am trying to 
forget seme things that I did. How- 
ever, I don't want you to be impressed 
with the idea that I committed any- 
thing criminal, anything that would 
deprive me of the Spirit of God. But I 
am sorry, O how sorry, that there was 
no restraint nor responsibility placed 
upon me, that 1 was not actively en- 
gaged in Church work during those 12 
years. But after that, for 24 
years past I have been more or less 
actively engaged in the ministry, and 
the more I am employed in it the more 
firmly I believe in the Gospel; and the 
more I testify that Jesus is the Christ 
and Joseph Smith is a prophet, the 
stronger I believe it. 

We must have a knowledge that Je- 
sus is the Christ, or we can not stand. 
Latter-day Saints who have failed are 
those who have not obtained a know- 
ledge that Jesus is the Christ; all such 
are liable to apostatize. I am afraid 
there will be a lot of apostates, and 
that worries me. 

You can't live on borrowed light any 
longer. This Church has passed through 
many close places, and, as my father 
said, it will pass through many othei 
close places before victory and triumph 
is given to you or given to the Church. 
I know a good deal more about this 
Church than the man did, one of those 
strangers that come in our midst, who 
went on a hill here recently and stood 
in an ant bed, and when the ants com- 
menced to bite he commenced to curse 



the "Mormons." I suppose he thought 
they were "Mormon" ants, and he held 
us responsible for them. 

Now there are a lot of people talking 
about us, and we have a great deal of 
cheap notoriety, but I am not at all 
concerned about it. I am not worrying 
about it; I don't stand with bated 
breath for fear this Church will be de- 
stroyed. This is the work of God; this 
is the Church of Jesus Christ. There 
are not devils enough to destroy it, and 
it can't be destroyed by men. If it 
could have been destroyed, some who 
claim to be members in the Church 
would have destroyed it years ago. I 
don't care how much harm is commit- 
ted Dy pretended members of tnis 
Church, they can't destroy it; they will 
destroy themselves. I care not how 
many apostates attempt it, they cannot 
destroy this Church, 

Now I want to serve notice on all 
Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian 
churches — I don't suppose they will take 
my advice; they never have done up 
to dale, but I would like to continue 
giving them good advice — I would ad- 
vise them never to receive a man into 
their church that had been a Latter- 
day Saint and apostatized from the 
unurch. Such individuals will never 
make good Catholics, good Methodists, 
nor good Presbyterians. They will be 
agitators, and make a deal of mischief 
in those churches, because they will be 
bo restless and unsettled that no one 
near them will have any peace or rest; 
ana tney will get to asking a lot of 
questions. The first thing they will ask 
is, "Where do you get your authority 
from?" and that will worry you a little. 
And they will ask other hard questions, 
and make trquble and mischief. And 
then they are no account anyhow, as 
members of any church. 

You never saw an apostate in your 
life, that was a Latter-day Saint and 
did right ud to a certain time ana 
then apostatised, that has ever settled 
down and been satisfied in any other 
church in the world. They are not even 
satisfied with Spiritualism, notwith- 
standing they may talk with spirits 
and get a great amount of information; 



58 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



they wont stay with that sect. 

And, by the way, I would like to serve 
notice on the Republicans and Demo- 
crats that the individuals of whom I 
have been speaking will never be good 
Democrats or Republicans either; they 
will not stay with their party. 

Now I want to serve notice on apos- 
tates. I am willing to carry the olive 
branch in my hand when I 
associate with the children of 
men in the world, I have nothing 
but the kindliest feelings towards 
them; but when an apostate lifts up 
his voice against this people, when he 
makes dastardly charges against the 
Latter-day Saints he lies, and I have 
no patience with him. I have 
breathed this mountain air so long 
that I feel inclined to discard a little 
of the Gospel and knock such men 
down, and repent afterward. I want 
to say to an apostate, or to any man 
that has been born and bred in the 
Church, he is a coward to lift up his 
"voice against this people. We are a 
little handful, only about 300,000, with 
over 100,000 children among the num- 
ber. If apostates had their way the 
whole United States would be against 
us. Persons who have lived in this 
country and received all that they 
own from this people, and who lift 
their voices against us are cowards. 
Whenever any man or woman wants 
to leave this Church, they have a 
right to do so, and it is our duty to 
treat them right, to extend to them 
every courtesy and kindness, and be 
their friend, if they refrain from lying 
and persecuting us. This is God's work, 
and just as sure as He lives, and as we 
breathe and have a being, this work 
will come off triumphant. There may 
not be very many of us left, but, let 
the number be ever so few, it will 
succeed. 

I want to say in conclusion, the only 
discipline I have had was by my own 
father, up to 15 years of age. For 
12 years after that time I was under 
no responsibility, but since then I 
have been actively engaged in this 
Church. I have been in business of 
different kinds; I have been a farmer, 



a stock raiser, a real estate man, and 
an implement man, but I never had 
one of the Apostles, or any one of the 
Presidency of the Church, interfere 
or even give me any advice or counsel 
in all those years of business. The 
only thing I am sorry for is that I 
didn't have sense enough to ask ad- 
vice. I have labored in the ministry 
for 13 years, and have been one of the 
First Council of Seventy, and have 
labored with the Apostles, in close as- 
sociation with them, and none of them 
have ever offered any suggestions or 
dictation in any way pertaining to my 
fi-anchise or political position. I 
knew Brigham Young almost as well 
as I knew my father. I knew Daniel 
H. Wells, a counselor of Brigham 
Young and associate of my father. I 
have known all these brethren down to- 
President Smith, and can testify that 
all the counsel and advice I have re- 
ceived from them has been a savor 
of life unto life. It has been a God- 
send to me, and I am grateful that I 
have been favored because of my as- 
sociation with men of God, who have 
given me counsel, such counsel that, 
if I follow it, will bring me back into 
the presence of my Eternal Father. 

Now, that is my testimony to this 
congregation. If you have got any- 
thing to say in favor of this people, 
whether you are in the Church or out, 
say it fearlessly. My father said to one 
of his grandchildren, who is living 
in Arizona and didn't take any active 
part in the Church: "Billy, these are 
my words to you, don't you ever lift 
up your' voice against this people." 
Speaking to me about my father's 
advice to him, he said, "Golden, I 
never have, and I thank God for it." 
I repeat the advice; never speak 
against the work of God, nor against 
His people. May the Lord bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 
My beloved brethren and sisters, I de- 
sire very much that you may assist me 
by your faith and prayers. I endorse 
the remarks of my brethren this after- 
noon, and also the remarks and teach- 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



59 



ings to which we have listened dur- 
ing- this general conference. I rejoice 
with you in a testimony that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, that he 
was led by the spirit and power of 
inspiration. When he went into a re- 
tired place to plead with the Lord for 
wisdom and understanding, he was 
the only person we know anything 
about, in that day and time, that ap- 
proached God in such faith and humil- 
ity that the Father responded to him 
and answered his prayer. "When he 
had gained knowledge and understand- 
ing, through his faith and humility 
and in answer to prayer, the inspira- 
tion of the Lord came upon him, and 
he was given the prophetic ministry 
that continued with him through all 
the remaining portion of his life, and 
that qualified him to organize the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. He was always true to hia 
calling and ministry. How impressive 
is the thought expressed in the beauti- 
ful words we read or sing in connec- 
tion with one of our Sunday school 
hymns, — 

"Oh, what rapture filled his bosom, for 
he saw the living God." 

And now, my brethren and sisters, hia 
life's history is before us, an open book 
that we can read and understand, and 
we may profit thereby if we desire to do 
so. All of those chosen by him were 
not true to him, nor true to the faith. 
If he had been lacking in the power 
and spirit of a prophet of God, do you 
think he would dare to have said to 
such men as Oliver Cowdery and Sid- 
ney Rigdon, men of learning of the 
world, who stood by him and assisted 
in the organization of the apostolic 
and other quorums of the Priesthood, 
"Step aside, you have lost the spirit of 
your calling and ministry, the Church 
can no longer fellowship you, and we 
have no further use for your adminis- 
trations." This was the course that 
he felt obliged to take; and the ser- 
vants of the Lord in all their ministry 
from that time to the present have 
arrayed themselves upon the side of 
right, of truth, and eternal justice, 
and whether alone or with many to 



sustain them, they take that stand. And 
so they continue today before the eyes 
of the world, ministers of the Lord. 
The president of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Proph- 
et, Seer and Revelator, to the Church, 
and his brethren who associate with 
him are endowed with the same power 
and the same prophetic ministry. 

I am reminded of a conversation I 
had with a gentleman recently, while 
traveling to the north. He was speak- 
ing of the Book of Mormon. He said 
he had read some portions of it. He 
was a lawyer from the state of Wyo- 
ming, and a tolerably well enlight- 
ened man, so far as I could judge. He 
said, "I don't believe that the Prophet 
found the golden plates, and translated 
the BooV of Mormon from those plates." 
"Well," I said, "what is your belief 
about the matter?" He replied, "I be- 
lieve that he was inspired to write the 
Book of Mormon just the same as Mat- 
thew, Mark, Luke and John were in- 
spired to write their history of the 
Lord's mission in the earth." I said, 
"That is a pretty good thought, and, 
for a man that does not understand the 
facts, I think your position might be 
considered fairly consistent; you are 
without a knowledge of the truth, how- 
ever." He thanked me and we*t on his 
way. 

I read an account of an incident re- 
cently, to which I will call your atten- 
tion, being reminded of it by the re- 
marks of brethren who have preceded 
me. A physician was seeking his son, 
who had returned to his home from a 
foreign land, and they met in the city 
of New York. The Father took the boy 
to his home of course, and he said=- 
"We will draw a curtain over the was- 
sail of that night," meaning that they 
spent it in libations to Bacchus, which 
Brother Wells failed to mention, the 
god of the wine cup. They wished to 
draw a curtain over that night, so that 
we would not know about their revelry. 
A son of mine recently returned from a 
mission to the countries of Germany 
and Switzerland, after an absence of 
three years. I met him at the depot 
and welcomed him home. That night 
we did not have any wine nor strong

drink, neither were there cigars passed 
around. There was no "smoker," as 
they term it, established, but we got 
down on our knees before God, jus as 
many of you have done, and offered up. 
a prayer of thanksgiving and praise to 
Almighty God that another of His sons 
had gone to proclaim the Gospel, gone 
to foreign lands on a mission of lifs 
and truth to the nations of the earth, 
and had come home pure and spotless 
as when he left his father's house. 
That is the kind of a celebration we 
gave. 

This people, of necessity, stand upon 
a higher plane than the people of the 
world occupy today, because of the 
knowledge which God has given unto 
us, and because of the ministration of 
Prophets and Apostles, whom we have 
with us today. We must perforce ac- 
centuate the principles of truth in 
which we believe, and although the ma- 
jority of mankind do not love us, do 
not have any fellowship for us, this 
does not change our position, and does 
not change our responsibility. We can- 
not go down to their level. If we could 
make them see the position we occupy, 
we might say, "Please pardon us, we 
cannot come down to your level, but if 
you will allow us, we will raise you up 
to the higher plane. Your statesmen 
may become mightier men, because, 
if they will keep the commandments of 
God, they will be filled with greater 
ability to benefit and bless mankind. 
We say to your tradesmen, and railroad 
men, and to all the great moving spir- 
its of the earth, If you will obey the 
Gospel, the Lord will fit and prepare 
you better to perform every duty that 
is laid upon you, as business men of 
the world, and as statesmen." 

I remember reading in the Pearl of 
Great Price, and in other revelations 
of the Lord, how the Lord stood in the 
midst of the spirits that inhabited the 
eternal worlds, and it is written, the 
Lord saw some that were choice, and 
He said, "These I will make my rulers." 
And He has made of these choice spirits 
His rulers of the world. More especi- 
ally has He sent those spirits in this 
age and time to inhabit tabernacles and 



to be numbered among His ministers 
in this Church and kingdom that He 
has established on the earth. Among 
those great spirits were numbered the 
Prophet Joseph, and those brethren 
who have followed in the same sacred 
and prophetic ministry. 

No wonder the Lord said "They are 
good, and of these I will make my 
rulers." He has kept His word; and 
we have among us today some of 
those choice spirits, and they are 
ruling and guiding and directing the 
destinies of this people and the des- 
tinies of mankind throughout the 
earth; for, in spite of opposition to 
the Church of Jesus Christ and the 
doctrines that lead to life eternal, the 
leaven of the Gospel is being felt from 
one end of Christianity to the other. 
A few years ago I remember hearing 
some minister of the Gospel, so styled, 
preach to his fellow men that hell was 
full of little infants who had not been 
baptized, and that all mankind who 
did not submit to be sprinkled in the 
church would lose all chances of re- 
demption, and would burn in hell for- 
ever. What heresy, what vile prin- 
ciples these are. But the people of the 
world, sind even the ministers of the 
gospels that they teach, are now in- 
clined to leave these heresies out of 
their doctrines, and are preaching 
today and adopting a better principle, 
a principle taught by our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ, when he said, 
"Suffer little children to come unto 
me and forbid them not, for of such 
is the kingdom of heaven." The 
ministers are beginning to realize the 
truth of this saying, because the ser- 
vants of the Lord have accentuated 
it, and declared that children are in- 
nocent until they are eight years of 
age, and are saved in His kingdom in 
this condition of innocency, without 
baptism. 

Consider also the principle of bap- 
tism for the dead, that sacred prin- 
ciple that goes beyond the narrow 
limits of life in this world. I remem- 
ber President Peery, who was at one 
time President of the Weber Stake of 
Zion, said to me: "Brother Young, 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

when I heard the gospel of baptism 
for the dead set forth by one of the 
Elders, in my native state, my heart 
■was touched, and I could have bowed 
down and kissed his feet, because he 
opened to me a new life, a new world, 
and I was caught in the gospel net. 
I can testify too," said he, "from that 
very moment, the intelligence of the 
Holy Spirit illuminated my mind, and 
I learned that Jesus is the Christ and 
that Joseph was His chosen prophet." 

All these glorious principles, my 
brethren and sisters, are before us, 
and we are striving to live by them; 
and although the world does not en- 
dorse us, or love us, we must do our 
whole duty. 

May the Lord bless you, and give you 
power to be faithful and true unto 
the end of your days, for He has said 
truly, "Be faithful unto death, and I 
will give you a crown of life." Amen. 

The Temple choir sang, "Go ye mes- 
sengers of glory."

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

The Youthful not ashani d of the Gospel— 
The p« ople pr.ig.essiag— Dcvoiiou of the 
Leaders of the Cnurch. 

The sensation that one feels in stand- 
ing before such hosts of Israel for the 
purpose of addressing them cannot be 
described — it can only be felt. It is 
quite overwhelming, I can assure you. 
I would like to impress upon those pres- 
ent the fact that the acoustic properties 
of this Tabernacle are wonderful. The 
building is of renown the world over 



for these properties. Therefore, you 
must remember that each whisper, each 
movement of the body, or the shuffling 
of the feet of any person in the con- 
gregation will be reverberated and' 
echoed throughout the building; and 
when these sounds are multiplied, then 
there is noise and confusion in the whole 
house. In order for any speaker's 
voice to carry into all parts of this 
Tabernacle and penetrate the ears of 
the congregation, all present must re^ 
main as quiet as they possibly can. 
There are probably between ten or 
twelve thousand people here this after- 
noon, and I presume all have come for 
the purpose of worshiping God in spirit 
and in truth, and with a desire to hear 
all that may be said by those who shall 
address you. This is my condition, 
and I rejoice greatly that so many of 
the Saints evidently have the same 
spirit and the same desire to hear the 
word of the Lord from His servants. 
It causes me to praise God when I see 
the Saints so anxious to hear that they 
willingly stand through a long meeting, 
if unable to find seats, for the purpose 
of enjoying the spirit of the confer- 
ence. 

The statement has been repeated here 
which was made by some of our friends 
(?) that there are many of the younger 
Latter-day Saints who are becoming 
ashamed of the Gospel. Now, I ven- 
ture to say that there is not one indi- 
vidual here today who is a member of 
the Church of all the ten or twelve 
thousand present, who is ashamed of 
the Gospel. And if there are any such 
anywhere, then, of course, we know 
that they themselves are at fault, that 
their lives do not conform with the 
principles of the Gospel, that the 
Spirit of the Lord has reproved them, 
and that they are so weak in character 
that they are unable to repent and re- 
form and place themselves in harmony 
with the spirit of the Gospel. 

My labors have been among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and during the last six 
months I have visited quite a number 
of the Stakes of Zion, being in attend- 
ance at a Stake conference upon each 
Sabbath day. consequently I have 



<62 



GENERAL. CONFERENCE. 



visited in that time nearly half 
of the Stakes of Zion. I can 
testify to these friends of ours, 
and to all the Saints, that I found in 
each of the Stakes I have visited the 
same anxiety among the members of 
the Church to attend their Stake con- 
ferences as we see maifest here today 
at the semi-annual conference of the 
Church. It has been our experience 
to see all the meeting houses crowded 
to the doors, and every available space 
occupied by young and old who were 
desirous to hear what might be said. 
I am convinced that there is a general 
improvement all along the line among 
the people. We are not at a stand- 
still, neither at home nor abroad. 
It is quite impossible that the Church 
of Jesus Christ should ever come to 
a stand still. The fact that one of our 
mission presidents may from time to 
time report fewer baptisms than usual 
is no evidence whatever that the 
Church is at a standstill. Many are 
called, but few are chosen. While the 
baptisms in one mission-field or an- 
other may be few, nevertheless the 
Elders laboring there are actively en- 
gaged in bearing their testimonies to 
thousands and tens of thousands of 
people, and this is by far the greater 
part of the mission of the Elders who 
are in the world declaring the truth. 
This Gospel shall be preached in all the 
world as a witness before the end shall 
come, and if these servants of God are 
standing on the street corners in the 
various cities, and traveling along the 
highways and byways of the villages 
and towns, raising their voices in pro- 
clamation of the truth, as well as bear- 
ing testimony in the homes of the peo- 
ple. I say to you that the work of God is 
going on rapidly in the earth, and we 
are speeding toward the ultimate con- 
summation of all God's purposes con- 
cerning this great work of the latter- 
day. The Saints have every reason 
to be wonderfully encouraged. Faith 
is increasing. Faithfulness to duty and 
in keeping Ihe commanlrrents of God 
and in listening to the counsels of the 
authorities of the Church is becoming 



more and more apparent, and rapid 
advancement and progress on the path 
of righteousness is certainly manifest 
to any individual who will pause for 
a moment and acquaint himself with 
the conditions that exist among the 
Latter-day Saints. 

We have in our midst as leaders, 
men of God, men of fried integrity, men 
of pure devotion, who live among 
us wholly that they may do 
the will of the Lord, and 
that they may bear the burden 
which has been laid upon them of be- 
ing preachers of righteousness and ex- 
emplars among the people. They are 
performing their duty as the Lord gives 
them light. The saints are becoming 
better and stronger day by day. The 
power of God is being manifest among 
us more and more as time rolls on. We 
ought to be encouraged in these men 
whom the Lord hath called to lead us 
in these days, as we have been encour- 
aged in the men who have held these 
leading positions since the restoration 
of the Gospel in our age. If you will 
take the trouble to read their history 
and to study their lives, and then com- 
pare their lives and conduct with the 
lives and conduct of the ancient Proph- 
ets and Apostles, you will find that the 
comparison will be to the disadvantage 
of the Prophets and Apostles who lived 
in former days, if disadvantage may be 
found at all. The idea that the Proph- 
ets of old were anything more than 
men is a mistake. Many people look 
upon them as being something super- 
natural, nevertheless they were men- 
men, as Paul expresses it, of like pas- 
sions unto ourselves. The Lord took 
them, and clothed them with His Spir- 
it and power, and while in the main 
they served God and performed the 
mission that He gave them, yet they 
sometimes made mistakes. I presume 
it would be considered blasphemy by 
those who are not of us, to compare 
the latter-day leaders of the Church 
with the former-day leaders of the 
Church. But I look upon the Prophet 
Joseph Smith as the equal of any 
Prophet that has ever lived. I look 
upon him as being as highly favored 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 



63 



of God as any man ever was. I look 
upon him as a man who accomplished 
as successfully the great mission the 
Lord gave him to perform, as any other 
man ever accomplished a mission in the 
world. I look upon President Brigham 
Young, the successor of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, as being as great a lead- 
er among men as ever led men in the 
history of the world. He was as great 
as was Moses, and performed as great 
a work; for he performed successfully 
all that God called upon him to do. 
Furthermore, in all his life, he never 
showed the weaknesses that Moses 
showed while leading the children of 
Israel. We might go on, if time would 
permit, and consider the patriarchs. 
Some of the patriarchs were mentioned 
this morning, and I want to say to you 
that J look upon the Patriarch Joseph 
Smith, father of the Prophet 
Joseph, as being as great a 
patriarch, as highly favored of God, as 
sincere, as devoted, and as pure in his 
life as either of the Patriarchs Abra- 
ham, Isaac, and Jacob; and besides, he 
never resorted to the sharp practice in 
his dealings with his fellow men that 
characterized some of these other pa- 
triarchs in their dealings. Let us con- 
sider the missionary work that has been 
done by this Church. Paul the Apostle 
is looked upon as being the greatest 
missionary of primitive times. While 
he traveled a great deal in the world as 
it was then known, — which, when com- 
pared with the world as known today, 
was small indeed, — compared with his 
labors the labors of many of the ser- 
vants of God of latter-days who have 
carried the Gospel to Great Britain and 
to Scandinavia, and in the United 
States and the isles of the sea who have 
traversed many more miles than Paul 
ever did, have preached the Gospel to 
many thousands more people than Paul 
ever did, have led the way to the con- 
version of tens of thousands more peo- 
ple than Paul ever did, and who laid 
their lives down for the cause as Paul 
did. I would not disparage his work, 
but merely draw your attention to the 



fact that these men of latter-days have 
worked as hard, as sincerely, and have 
accomplished as much as did they of 
old, and the power of God has been 
made manifest with them to just as 
great an extent as was ever manifest to 
Paul or any of his fellow apostles. I 
look upon the Presidencies of the 
Church who have succeeded -the Prophet 
Joseph Smith as being the equal of 
Peter, James and John. While Peter, 
James and John were as good perhaps 
as men could be, nevertheless men who 
have lived in this day and who do live 
are as good as they were. I believe, 
however, our men of today have had a 
little advantage over those men of old, 
as they live in a dispensation of great- 
er fullness of the Gospel. They ought 
to be good men, and they are good men. 
They are what they ought to be; and 
you, my brethren and sisters, will only 
do right in sustaining and upholding 
them, in praying for them in your 
homes, and in doing all in your power 
to raise them in the eyes of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints and in the eyes of all the 
world, as men of God, endowed by Him 
to perform the work of the Gospel in 
the latter days. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren and 
sisters: I testify to you that the words 
of testimony which have been borne by 
the servants of God here during this 
conference' have been inspired of the 
Lord, and they are true. Like them, I 
am thankful to say that I know this is 
the work of the Lord, and that it will 
go on and triumph; that it cannot be 
stopped, neither will it ever stand still, 
until the righteousness of God shall 
prevail and the Kingdom of God be es«- 
tablished in its fullness. God grant that 
you may have the same testimony,"'as 
I am convinced the great majority of 
those present have. And is it not a 
grand thing? Is it not a light to our 
feet? Will it not ever guide us onward 
and upward until we merit and receive 
ralvation in the Kingdom of God? May 
the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints in 
all the world, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 

Operations of the Spirit of truth -No need 
to be Ashamed of "Utah and the Mor- 
mons." 

My brethren and sisters, I desire an 
interest in your faith and prayers, that 
during the few moments I stand be- 
fore you I may be inspired by our 
heavenly Father to give utterance to 
those words of instruction or admoni- 
tion that He would have me give you, 
occupying the position that I do. I 
have enjoyed the testimonies that have 
been borne. It has been meat and 
drink to me to mingle with my brothers 
and sisters in this semi-annual con- 
ference and to partake of the Spirit of 
the Father that has characterized the 
meetings. I sense the responsibility 
that rests upon the presiding authori- 
ties of the Church, when I look into 
the eager, upturned faces of the thou- 
sands assembled in this building and 
realize that you are but representatives 
of tens of thousands, yea, of hundreds 
of thousands, desirous of knowing the 
mind and will of our Father. We real- 
ize that the words uttered from this 
pulpit by those who are designated to 
speak to you are carried home to many 
who are unable, by reason of circum- 
stances over which they have no con- 
trol, to assemble with us. I have en- 
joyed more than I can tell the testi- 
monies of our brethren, that wherever 
they have gone the Spirit of our Father 
has been there in abundance. It is a 
strength to me to know that the breth- 
ren in California find the influence of 
the Lord there; that from the Eastern 
States comes the testimony that the 
s^me Spirit is there also; that the tes- 
timony of the president of the Southern 
States mission is that our heavenly 
Father pours out His blessings upon 
them there, and that from every Stake 
of Zion, and from every mission field 
which has been represented here, the 
same good word comes, that they have 
received the benediction of the Al- 
mighty upon their labors. 

When I heard one of the brethren 
make the statement that one of our 
sisters (and I desire to emphasize that 



she was a sister, though not a member 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints) had said that the young 
and rising generation were ashamed of 
Utah and the "Mormons," I felt con- 
strained to ask the question, And for 
what reason? Even allowing that it 
were possible to find within the borders 
of this great state, son or daughter of 
the patriotic, noble men and women, 
who have reared this commonwealth, 
who is ashamed of the labors performed 
by those whom our Father has honored 
—I say, granting that some such may 
be found; for what are they ashamed? 
Is it because in early days men and wo- 
men imbued with a desire to worship 
God according to the dictates of their 
consciences bade farewell to father, 
mother, and loved ones, denied them- 
selves home comforts and the blessings 
of social life, and turned their faces 
westward into this great wilderness, to 
take up their abode with the wild 
beasts and the still more savage red- 
man? Is it because the spirit that 
characterized Israel when Moses led 
them out of bondage filled the hearts 
of the early pioneers to this western 
land? Is it because men and women, 
imbued with a testimony of the divinity 
of this work felt that they could leave 
the comforts they had enjoyed from 
childhood and partake of the privation 
of pioneer life, and that they could af- 
ford to accept the reproach of parents 
and loved ones in many cases, and have 
their names cast out as evil, in order 
that they might worship their heavenly 
Father in spirit and in truth? Is it be- 
cause these brave men and women, 
struggling with privation and want, 
marked their pathway across the great 
plains by the bloody prints of their 
lacerated feet, in the frozen snow, or 
because when they came down out of 
the canyon to the east of us, looked on 
the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and 
saw the sun's rays scintillating upon 
the western sea and the barren soil 
of the desert cracked open in great 
seams under the burning heat of sum- 
mer, and they said, "We are outcasts 
from the place which should have been 
our home, but God being our helper. 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 



65 



we will rear a commonwealth here, and 
raise sons and daughters that shall give 
glory to His name?" Is it because 
where not one blade of grass grew be- 
fore, there are luxuriant fields of green 
today? Is it because where only the 
shadscab, sagebrush and greasewood 
covered the land, that today we have 
beautiful farms and gardens, the sus- 
tenance of thousands of our Father's 
happy children? Is it because the men 
and women whose lives have been dedi- 
cated to the service of our Father have 
passed away with their faith still 
strong, and have left their dying testi- 
mony with their sons and daughters 
that they know this is the work of the 
Master? Is it because tne wilderness 
has been made to blossom as the rose? 
Is it because the proportion of convicts 
and those who disobey the law of the 
land is less in Utah than in any other 
place in the wide world? Is 
it because the proportion of 
children in the schools is greater 
to the number of inhabitants than in 
any other state or territory of our 
great Union? Is it because there are 
more boys and girls who can stand upon 
their feet in the presence of a congre- 
gation, and bear their testimony to the 
divinity of the work of our Father than 
can be found among any like number 
of people anywhere else? Is it because 
there is a greater amount of virtue, 
kindness, and loving, tender care mani- 
fest in the homes of the Latter-day 
Saints than can be found in most places 
on our Father's footstool? Is it because 
today we are considered a peculiar peo- 
ple? Is it because we believe that 
Jesus is the Christ? Is it because we 
believe the Old and New Testament to 
be the revealed word of our Heavenly 
Father? Is it because boys and girls 
who go from these grand mountains 
to the colleges of the east, almost with- 
out exception, return covered with hon- 
or? Is it because of the success they 
have attained in their ministry? Is it 
because we have from fifteen hundred 
to two thousand men who have left 
their fathers and mothers, their wives 
and children, have turned their backs 
upon the comforts of this life, and gone 



out into the world to testify that Jesus 
was indeed the Christ, and to depend 
for their daily bread upon the kindness 
of the people? Is it because these sons 
and, in some cases, these daughters 
have the courage, in face of the opposi- 
tion of the world, to testify that they 
know that Jesus is the Christ and that 
the Gospel He has given to the earth 
is the power of God unto salvation? Is 
it because all over our broad land there 
are happy homes, and sons and daugh- 
ters who have been reared to respect 
and honor the great ones of our na- 
tion, and the men our Father has 
raised up to guide the destinies of His 
people in the day and age in which we 
live? I say, is it for these things that 
anyone should be ashamed of Utah? 
No place upon our Father's footstool 
will you go today where you will find 
more patriotic, home-loving, God-fear- 
ing people in proportion to the inhab- 
itants than you will find among the 
valleys of these everlasting hills. We 
have been taught to honor our fathers 
and our mothers. We have been taught 
to keep the commandments given by 
the creator to Moses on Mount Sinai. 
We have been taught to uphold the gov- 
ernment of the great country in which 
we live. And Utah's sons have already 
brought honor and glory to this state 
by their valor and patriotism in the 
Philippines. We have been taught 
that the Constitution of the United 
States was inspired of Almighty God, 
and that it is the duty of every boy 
and every girl of "Mormon" birth to 
uphold and- sustain it, if need be, with 
life itself. We have been taught that 
this great country of America is th»* 
promised land, and that here our Father 
has given an opportunity for His chil- 
dren to worship Him according to the 
dictates of their consciences. We have 
been taught to love our enemies, and 
to pray for those who despitefully use 
us and speak evil of us. We have been 
taught that it is our mission in the 
world to preach Christ and Him cruci- 
fied, and to teach the same Gospel that 
He gave to the world when He minis- 
tered among the children of men. I 
say, instead of being ashamed of Utah 



66 



GENERAL, CONFERENCE. 



and "Mormonism," any boy or girl who 
will examine the splendid record of the 
people of this State will be grateful for 
it, and they will be able to hold up their 
heads and say, "I am proud of the 
country whence I came," and I do not 
believe there are many who would be 
recreant. I do not believe, with fathers 
and mothers such as I see before me 
today, that their children would give 
voice to such a sentiment as that, but 
I do believe that with a knowledge of 
the character of the teachings of the 
Church of ♦Jesus Christ of Later-day 
Saints, one could not have such a 
feeling. And I take it for granted 
that the sentiment so expressed was a 
wish that was father to the thought. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, to 
be numbered with you. Our Father has 
given us a great mission among the 
children of men. And while our broth- 
ers and sisters of other faiths are doing, 
in most cases, what they believe to be 
right and proper, the Creator has 
given us a special calling, and He 
has admonished us to perform that 
duty with kindness, love and char- 
ity. When you are reviled, do not re- 
vile again. When others speak evil of 
you, pity them, and pray for them. Re- 
member the example of the Divine Mas- 
ter, who, when suspended upon the 
cruel tree, said, "Father, forgive them, 
for they know not what they do." The 
efforts of your missionary sons and 
daughters who are scattered in the 
world today are characterized by that 
spirit. They are finding the honest in 
heart wherever they go. The Gospel 
is being preached to the poor, as 
the Master said it would be, and 
hundreds and thousands of His 
children have been brought to under- 
stand the teachings that have been giv- 
en to the earth in the day and age In 
which we live. After we have perform- 
ed our part by preaching the gospel 
to the children of men, if we have done 
it painstakingly and carefully and been 
exemplary our duty has been done, 
and the result is in the hands of the 
Master. "Paul may plant, and Apol- 
los may water, but it is God that giv- 
oth the increase.' No matter how gift- 



ed we may be, or how choice our lan- 
guage, it is the Spirit of our Father 
that reaches the heart and brings con- 
viction of the divinity of this work. 

I am one of the sons who is proud of 
Utah, whose ancestors have given to 
this land examples of noble manhood 
and womanhood, whose lives have been 
dedicated to the blessing of their fel- 
low creatures. I rejoice in my lineage 
and in that I am considered worthy to 
be one, even of the humblest in Israel. 
I pray that the Spirit of the Redeemer 
may burn in our hearts, that our chil- 
dren may never prove recreant to the 
great opportunity our Father has giv- 
en them, but day by day, as they give 
evidence in their lives of the purity 
of their home teachings and chastity of 
their natures, the beauty of the Gos- 
pel will be more appreciated by our fel- 
low men. Oh! that we might be able to 
give mankind an understanding of our 
feelings, that they might realize that 
we do not desire to curtail their oppor- 
tunities, but that they might feel that 
our hearts reach out to them in love 
and kindness, not with any desire to 
hurt. Our mission in the world is to 
save souls, to bless them, and to place 
them in a condition that they may go 
back into the presence of our Father, 
crowned with glory, immortality and 
eternal life. If they do not understand 
it in this world, we have the witness 
from our Father that they will under- 
stand it in the life to come. Let us 
day by day so minister in the flesh that 
men seeing our good works, may glori- 
fy our Father which is in heaven, that 
when our life shall go out it may be 
said of us that the world is better for 
our having lived in it. Let the kind- 
ness, joy and peace that characterizes 
our efforts be a blessing to our Father's 
children wherever it may be our priv- 
ilege to roam, so that when we go to 
the other side it may be said to us by 
Him who rules and reigns on high, 
"Well done, good and faithful servant." 
I testify to you that this is the work of 
our Father, and it will roll forth until 
He comes again in the clouds of heaven, 
when He shall direct whose right It is 
to rule and reign. Then those who

have not understood this work will un- 
derstand it, and, thanks be to the tes- 
timony that we have received, they 
may yet have an opportunity to partake 
of the blessings our Father has in store 
for His children. 

That the influence of this conference 
may be disseminated throughout Israel 
and the world, and that the Spirit of 
love and peace may be with all our 
Father's children, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

My brethren and sisters, as this build- 
ing is overflowing at this time with the 
sons and daughters of the Lord anxi- 
ous to hear His word and to worship 
before Him in the beauty of holiness, 
so my soul today is overflowing with 
gratitude to our Heavenly Father and 
with joy and thanksgiving that I have 
the privilege of assembling with this 
vast congregation to take part in the 
exercises of this conference. I have 
no language to express the feelings 
that well up in my heart today. When 
I look upon this congregation of Lat- 
ter-day Saints and realize how many 
they represent in the various parts of 
the Church, in this and other lands, 
I am led to exclaim like one when the 
electric telegraph was first thoroughly 
understood and utilized, "What hath 
God wrought!" This is the work of 
God, it is true, the Lord has had to call 
to His aid on earth many of His sons 
and daughters to assist in the establish- 
ment of the latter-day kingdom, and 
that He now has on Mount Zion many 
who will be saviors of men. Yet the 
kingdom is the Lord's, the work is His, 
and to Him be the praise and the glory. 
However, I would not detract in the 
least from the praise that is due to the 
faithful laborers in this cause. I can 
join heartily in our popular hymn, 
"Praise to the man who communed 
with Jehovah: Jesus anointed that 
prophet and seer." It is right to give 
words of praise and to recognize the 
labors of the faithful servants of God 



who have lived for the truth and died 
in its defense, and also to express our 
faith in the men who have succeeded 
the Prophet as the leaders of Israel in 
the latter days. And I do not believe 
that any man who ever stood at the 
head of the Church had more of the 
love, faith, confidence, prayers and sup- 
port of the Latter-day Saints than our 
present leader, President Joseph F. 
Smith, who is of the blood of the 
prophets, as well as being imbued with 
the spirit of his calling. I believe that' 
the Latter-day Saints have full confi- 
dence in him as the leader of the 
Church, and his Counselors, and in the 
men who are associated intimately with 
him in carrying on this great latter-day 
work. 

I have enjoyed every meeting of this 
conference. I have watched carefully 
the remarks that have been made by 
those who have spoken, and I can bear 
testimony to their truth, and in them I 
recognize the voice of the Lord. When 
Jesus was on earth He declared Him- 
self to be "the good shepherd," and 
He said: "My sheep hear my voice, 
and they follow me; and a stranger 
they will not follow, because they know 
not the voice of a stranger." I hope 
that the sheep of Israel who are here 
today, and those whom they represent, 
are able to distinguish between the 
voice of the good shepherd and the 
voice of the stranger, and that they 
will never be led aside from the path 
in which they should walk, but that 
they will keep their eye upon the prize 
of the mark of their high calling in 
Christ Jesus, and press forward on the 
strait and the narrow way that lead- 
eth unto eternal lives, and that they 
will not be turned to the right_hand 
nor to the left by the voice of the 
stranger. We have heard from several 
of our brethren. The tones of their 
voices, their complexions, their stature, 
their physical development, their intel- 
lectual powers, are all different; but the 
one voice has been heard through this 
conference, and that is the voice of 
the Lord, the voice of the good shep- 
herd, through His agents whom He has 
appointed to carry on His work in 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these latter times. That voice has 
found an echo in my heart. I rejoice 
in it and praise the Lord. When I 
look back upon my past life and labors 
in this Church and behold what I do 
today, I say in my soul, Blessed and 
praised be the name of the Lord! 

While our brethren were talking this 
morning in regard to the terms and 
times of missionary labor, I thought of 
my first missionary labors in the old 
world. More than fifty-three years 
ago I was called to go out, as a boy, to 
lift up my voice and proclaim the truth 
of the everlasting Gospel; for God had 
planted that truth in my soul and had 
given me a witness that this is His 
work. The Spirit of the Lord had 
borne testimony to my spirit that God 
had in very deed, in the last days, com- 
menced the work spoken of by all the 
holy prophets since the world began, 
and that Joseph Smith, whom he had 
raised up, was indeed a prophet of the 
ilving God. I went out and labored 
as a missionary in different parts of 
Great Britain, and the Lord was with 
me, and His power was upon me. I 
did not think about laboring for a year, 
or two years, or three years, but to la- 
bor until I was released; and my labors 
went on from year to year until I had 
been in the ministry incessantly for 
over ten yea'rs before I was privileged 
to be released and come here to 
the mountains to rejoice with the 
saints in the blessings of the gospel 
of peace. When I was sent on a mis- 
sion again to the old world, I was 
gone three years and a half, and there 
was a talk about my staying another 
year. When I went again, I did not 
stay there quite a year. So there is 
no particular term for a mission. The 
brethren and sisters should not feel 
that the presidents of missions are un- 
der obligations to release their sons 
or their daughters when two years 
have elapsed from the time they leave 
home. 

The missionaries in the world are 
imbued with this spirit that I have 
been talking about, and they bear with 
them the same voice. It has what we 
call the proper "ring" to it. We could 



not describe it exactly in words, 
but there is something about the 
preaching of the gospel by the 
Elders of Israel, something 
about the testimony that is 
borne by the servants and handmaid- 
ens of the Lord, something about their 
praying, their singing, their harmony, 
their melody, the glorious music which 
comes from them, whether by choirs 
or by single voices — something inex- 
plicable, there is a tone and a ring to 
it that enters into our souls, and there 
is something within us that har- 
monizes with it. It is the voice of the 
Good Shepheard, Jesus of Nazareth, the 
Savior of the world, who has come in 
these last days, in company with the 
Eternal Father, to establish the king- 
dom and work of the latter times. His 
voice has been heard in reality; His 
voice is ringing in the testimony of 
His servants, and the spirit which He 
brought with Him from on high is 
here in His Church, and it will remain 
and abide and continue. The power, 
the light, and the glory thereof will 
go forth to the uttermost parts of the 
earth, and the honest and upright in 
heart will be attracted thereby, and 
when they hear the sound of the gos- 
pel there will be something within 
them that will correspond to it, and 
thev will embrace it. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the 
Lord has brought us into these moun- 
tain heights. What for? That we 
may organize perfectly according to 
the pattern which He has revealed. 
The first meeting of this conference 
brought forth a clear exposition of the 
order of the Church. When President 
Smith was declaring it I reioiced ex- 
ceedingly in knowing that it was an 
evidence that God laid the foundation 
of this work, and that the organiza- 
tion of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is something be- 
yond human wisdom. It was the pow- 
er of God by which this organization 
was given to mankind, and if we will 
onW carry out the designs of the Lord, 
it will go forth steadily to victory. 
No weapon that is formed against it

will prevail, no obstacle placed in its 
way will retard its progress. But we 
are expected to do our part in this 
great organization that God has set 
up, that it may accomplish the work 
for which it is designed. The Lord 
has promised to us that if we will do 
His will and keep His commandments 
He will fight our battles. We are not 
called upon to use carnal weapons; 
we are called upon to clothe ourselves 
with the armor of salvation, to carry 
the sword of truth, to labor as the 
soldiers of Christ, not with carnal 
weapons or with the power of this 
world, bvt with light and truth and 
with the power of the Almighty, with 
which He will encircle us and by 
which we will overcome. 

I want to say to my young friends 
here today that their strength and 
the strength of this work will be in 
their virtue, in their honesty, in their 
upright course of conduct in this life. 
The gospel that we have received is 
a gospel of libertv. but not of licence. 
There is nobody in bondage in this 
church. We are at perfect liberty to 
do that which we desire to do, so far 
as we have power. But we are not 
permitted, if we are saints of the liv- 
ing God, to go into corruption and 
wickedness and into the evils of this 
world. True, we have the power, but 
the Lord has given us commandments 
concerning these things, and He ex- 
pects us to be a righteous people. Not 
but what we are subject to the frailties 
of humanity and to the ills of mortal 
flesh; but we are called out of the world 
to be the saints of the living God, 
and the Lord has said in the 
latter days, as in times of old, 
"Be ye clean that bear the vessels of 
the Lord." The Lord expects the 
young men of Israel to be pure and 
virtuous in their conduct, just as 
much as he requires it of the daugh- 
ters of Israel. Let that be understood. 
In the world, if a woman goes wrong 
she falls almost to rise no more; but 
the man can steep himself in wicked- 
ness and corruption and fall into vice 
and folly, and he can be welcomed into 



society. That is not according to the 
gospel of Christ. It is not according 
to what people call "Mormonism." 
The Lord expects men to be pure as 
well as women, and He has brought us 
into these mountains that we may raise 
up a holy generation, a peculiar people, 
a nation of priests, who will afterwards, 
some time in eternity, be kings as well 
as priests, ruling and reigning in the 
house of Israel forever. As I have said, 
the strength of this people is in their 
comparative purity, in their righteous- 
ness, in their sincerity. They are not 
a set of hypocrites. 

The servants of God do not preach for 
hire; they do not divine for money; but 
they labor for the good of mankind, 
and they have in their hearts a desire 
for the salvation of the souls of men. 
For this our Elders go out into the 
world; for this the servants of God la- 
bor at home; and I know as I know 
that I live that the men who stand at 
the head of affairs here are honorable, 
upright, virtuous, kind-hearted, loving 
men, and that their sole desire is to 
build up the kingdom in righteousness 
and to bless the people by disseminating 
light and truth, giving counsel that is' 
wise and wholesome, correcting evils 
when they find them, and watching 
carefully over the interests of the Saints 
of God. Now, my brethren and sisters, 
we will sustain them by our faith and 
prayers and by carrying out their coun- 
sels. This kingdom is sure to prevail; 
there is no question about that; and if 
you and I want to prevail with it we 
must live according to the principles 
that the Lord has revealed for our guid- 
ance. We must be His Saints in very 
deed. We must keep His command- 
ments, purify our lives, and live as 
Saints, not merely in meeting and in 
our public gatherings, but in the home, 
on the farm, in the workshop. Wher- 
ever we are we must remember that we 
are called of God to be Saints; that He 
has called us out of the world for this 
special work. As we have been told in 
this conference, we have a mission to 
perform, and it is not simply to gather 
around us the good things of this world. 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



That is all right as far as it goes. No 
matter how much we can get on right- 
eous principles, the .Lord is pleased with 
us, and some day He will make this 
people the richest in temporal things of 
all the peoples of the earth. But we 
have been called with this special mis- 
sion, to carry the Gospel of Christ to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and peo- 
ple; and if we cannot go out ourselves, 
we can send our sons and daughters 
and sustain those that can go. We can 
also help those that are gathered home. 
When they come into our midst, look 
after them; see that they are not al- 
lowed to fall into the ways of the 
stranger, or to be led astray by those 
who would seek to deceive them; but 
guide their footsteps in the path of 
peace. 

While we live we have this mission 
to perforin, and when we depart hence 
and go beyond the veil, we will be just 
the same people, — having merely 
dropped off the outer covering of the 
flesh — and our labors will be continued 
there. The Gospel will not only be 
preached to every creature on the 
earth, but to every son and daughter 
of Adam who has dwelt in the flesh and 
passed away into the other world with- 
out hearing the truth. For God's tender 
mercies are "over all His works," and 
we are all His children, and He loves us 
and desires our salvation. But He 
knows that that cannot be accom- 
plished unless we walk in the ways of 
salvation, and an opportunity to receive 
His word will be given to every soul 
that has breathed the breath of life in 
the body, either here on earth or in the 
regions beyond. I rejoice in the knowl- 
edge of this great truth — only one out 
of many truths that have been brought 
forth through the ministration of the 
latter-day Prophet. I rejoice in the 
knowledge that the Gospel of peace will 
come to every creature. 

1 bear you my testimony that I know 
as I know that I live, and have known 
it for over fifty-four years, that this is 
the work of God. I bear testimony be- 
fore the heavens and the earth that God 
in the last days has established the 
work spoken of by the ancient prophets; 



that the truth has been revealed in its 
purity; that it will go on until the full- 
ness thereof has been made known from 
the heavens; that the spirit of revela- 
tion from on high has been poured out; 
that the holy Priesthood, held by men 
of old, has been restored in the latter 
days, and that it is here now and will 
never be taken again from the earth. 
When God commenced this work, as He 
stated. He sent the authority and pow- 
er of the holy apostleship "for the last 
days and for the last time," and He 
will not take it away again nor give it 
to another people. This is His work, 
His Church, the beginning of His King- 
dom on the earth, and it will go forth 
to victory. Zion is being built up in the 
way that the Lord has appointed, and 
the work of salvation is going on for 
the living and for the dead. The Lord 
said we were not to be afraid of 
our enemies, and we are not to be 
ashamed of His work, for He will 
take care of it. I rejoice before the 
Lord that I am in Zion. I am remind- 
ed of the sayings of Isaiah the Prophet 
concerning the Zion of the latter days: 
"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, 
and the glory of the Lord is risen up- 
on thee. For, behold, the darkness shall 
cover the earth, and gross darkness the 
people; but the Lord shall arise upon 
thee, and his glory shall be seen upon 
thee. And the Gentiles shall come to 
thy light, and kings to the brightness 
of they rising. Lift up thine eyes 
round about; and see: all they gather 
themselves together, they come to thee; 
thy sons shall come from far, and thy 
daughters shall be nursed at thy side." 

Every word spoken by the Prophets 
of old and' by the Prophets of latter 
times concerning this great work wiil 
be fulfilled. I know it will prevail. It 
cannot be overcome. I echo the senti- 
ments of my brethren and say: Treat 
our friends who appear to be our ene- 
mies with kindness, with charity and 
with brotherly love. Let us not get an- 
gry with them. Sometimes that spirit 
naturally arises in our hearts, and we 
feel it is all very well to say, "Father, 
forgive them, for they know not what 
they do;" but how about those who do 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS, 



71 



know what they do? How about those 
who willfully, intentionally and malici- 
ously malign our brethren, distort the 
truth, and seek to bring trouble and 
injury upon the Latter-day Saints? 
What about them? Just leave them in 
the hands of the Lord, and do not allow 
irritation to arise in your breasts for 
that is what they desire, but let us in 
patience possess our souls, as Christ 
commanded. In the tribulations of the 
latter days, when all men should speak 
evil concerning His people; when they 
should revile them and persecute 
them, and say all manner of evil 
against them falsely, for His name's 
sake; "rejoice," said He, "and he ex- 
ceeding glad, for so persecuted they the 
Prophets which were before you," and 
"in patience possess ye your souls." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let us 
continue in this good work. Let us be 
proud of the things that God has given 
unto us, proud of our homes, proud of 
our State, proud of our glorious coun- 
try, and of the Constitution of the 
United States, which God inspired His 
servants to bring forth, to establish 
liberty, that every soul might have an 
opportunity of worshiping God accord- 
ing to the dictates of his conscience, 
and that perfect liberty might prevail 
throughout this loved land. Let us re- 
joice in these things, and thank and 
praise the name of the Lord, and show 
our gratitude to Him by walking in the 
straight way, turning neither to the 
right nor to the left, but pressing on- 
ward, that we may receive the crown 
of eternal lives in the presence of our 
Father. May God help us individually 
to conquer and overcome, that we may 
sit down with Him in His kingdom, as 
Christ overcame and sat down upon the 
Father's throne. Peace and the bless- 
ings of God abide with all Israel, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir then sang an anthem, "God 
of Israel hear our prayer," with

If from a distance you look upon the 
dial of a clock, you may know that the 



hands are moving, but you cannot see 
them move. You may look upon the 
grass, upon the trees, and upon other 
fcrms of vegetation, and you may know 
that the grass and the trees and the 
other vegetation are growing; but you 
cannot see the minute additions made 
to them by which they grow. And so 
it is in relation to a work of the char- 
acter of this work in which we are en- 
gaged, and which the world calls Mor- 
rronism— a work that has grown to its 
present proportions little by little; 
whose doctrines have developed pre- 
cept by precept, here a little and there 
a little, line upon line. Its growth has 
been so gradual, the development of 
its doctrines so slow, that men, look- 
ing upon it casually, or from a distance 
may not possiblj- be able to discern its 
growth. After the lapse of time, how- 
ever, we may see that the hand upon 
the dial has moved some distance; that 
the grass has increased several inches, 
and that the trees have grown several 
feet taller and several inches larger in 
diameter. So also, by looking upon 
"Mormonism" after the -lapse of consid- 
erable time, I think we may gather 
very much of encouragement from the 
amount of growth discernable in it. 

If you count thel sending of the 
prophet of this last dispensation to the 
earth as the beginning of God's great 
latter da3 r work, we shall have nearly 
a, century in which to consider its 
growth; for on the twenty-third of next 
December it will lack but one year of 
being a century since the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith was born. At about fifteen, 
you remember, in response to his beau- 
tiful faith in God, he received his first 
great revelation, in which he beheld the 
Father and the Son as they communi- 
cated to him the great truth that they 
were about to begin a great and mar- 
velous work in the earth that should 
prepare the way for the glorious coming 
of the Son of God in the clouds of 
heaven with power and great glory, to 
reign with his Saints in the earth not 
or.ly as Lord of lords, but also as King 
of kings. A few years later the knowl- 
edge was revealed of the American 
volume of scripture — the Book of Mor-

rnon— an abridged history of the ancient 
irhabitants of thi~ western world, and 
containing- an account of the hand deal- 
ings of God with them. "While it was 
in course of translation, John the Bap- 
tist, a resurrected man, an angel of 
God, came to Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, as was most fitting, to in- 
struct them in the matter of repentance 
and baptism. I say as was most fitting 
with reference to John's coming and in- 
struction because the information these 
men, Joseph and Oliver, were seeking 
was about baptism; and who among all 
the heavenly hosts was so competent to 
tt ach men on that subject as he who by 
way of pre-eminence in his earth ca- 
reer was called the Baptist — John, the 
Baptizer. Upon them, that is upon 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, he 
conferred what is known to us as the 
lesser Priesthood, and gave them the 
great promise that this Priesthood 
should never again be taken from the 
earth until the sons of Levi should 
offer an offering in righteousness to the 
Lord. He promised them also that soon 
still higher authority would be given 
them. Tn fulfillment of that promise 
three great Apostles of the Christian 
dispensation — Peter, James, and John, 
the disciple whom Jesus loved — came 
and conferred upon the heads of these 
men, Joseph and Oliver, the holy Apos- 
tleship, the High Priesthood, by virtue 
of which they were authorized to or- 
ganize the Church of Christ once more 
in the earth, and preach the Gospel in 
all the world. "Under the keys of this 
authority and power, on the sixth day 
of April, 1S30, they organized the 
Church with six members, in the hum- 
ble log home of the Whitmers, in Fay- 
ette, Seneca county, New York. Short- 
ly afterwards they began to extend 
their ministry in the surrounding 
neighborhoods, baptising the people and 
confirming them members of the 
Church. 

Side by side with this early develop- 
ment of the work of God, there was also 
developed a spirit of opposition and 
persecution against it. Wherever the 
work spread, the spirit of op- 
position accompanied it. But notwith- 



standing the efforts of the) adversary, 
it prospered and grew; for there was 
the germ of life in the seeds planted by 
the hand of God and His angels. 

In a short time the Zion of God, or the 
center place for the Zion of God upon 
this American continent, was point- 
ed out and dedicated unto the 
Lord. The land of America was 
declared to be, not the new world, 
but the old— the land where Adam, 
the Ancient of Days, dwelt, and 
where the smoke of his burnt sacrifices 
to God rose from the altar which he 
reared in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ah- 
man; located in the northern part of th,e 
State of Missouri. The further declara- 
tion was also made that that was the 
place to which finally the Ancient of 
Days would return, and nations should 
be assembled, and our father Adam, not 
bowed and bent with age, but in the full 
vigor of an immortal manhood, would 
gather together the hosts of his poster- 
ity, and would come there to bless them, 
while the heavens would open and one 
like unto the Son of God should come, 
and there should be given unto him a 
kingdom, and power, and the dominion 
of the earth, and the Saints should pos- 
sess the kingdom forever and forever. 
(See Daniel, vii.) 

These were a few of the things re- 
vealed in the early history of this 
Church. These were the foundation 
stones upon which your faith and my 
faith today is resting. This was the 
beginning of the great building whose 
Builder and Maker is God — the struc- 
ture the world may see rising ever 
higher and higher before the world's 
gaze. 

After a time other great truths were 
unfolded. Moses came and conferred 
upon the Prophet the keys of the gath- 
ering of Israel; Elias who lived in the 
days of Abraham, came and conferred 
upon him the keys of the sealing pow- 
er; Elijah also came — Elijah of whom it 
was decreed that before the great, and 
dreadful day of the Lord should come, 
he should be sent to earth to perform 
a mission, the effect of which would be 
to turn the hearts of the children to the 
fathers and the hearts of the fathers

to the children, lest the whole earth 
be smitten with a curse at Messiah's 
coming: and from thence comes the 
great principle which makes us under- 
stand the meaning of that term, "the 
everlasting gospel" — one that endures 
not alone in time, but in eternity; one 
whose saving power is not limited to 
the brief span of mortal life as known 
to us, but a gospel that shall endure as 
long as the ages endure, carrying with 
it, too, all those great powers that 
make for the salvation of the children 
of men. 

And so step by step, step by step, line 
upon line, precept upon precept, these 
principles have been revealed, and they 
have been operating, and have 
brought to pass that which men 
may see this day. This is th* 
dispensation of the fullness of 
times, and we see running into it, as 
mighty streame rush into the ocean, all 
the former dispensations, putting us in 
touch with them, putting them in touch 
with us; and we see that God has had 
but on ' great purpose in view from the 
beginning, and that has been the sal- 
vation of His children. And now has 
come the final day, the final dispensa- 
tion, when truth and light and righ- 
teousness must flood the earth. 

This work in which we are engaged is 
not a mere skirmish with error. It is 
not a battle of the outposts. It is not 
an occasion where a more or less bril- 
liant mind has seized upon and de- 
veloped some fragments or truth, and 
made them honorable for a moment in 
the eyes of men, but soon to be lost 
sight of — to be forgotten with the death 
of him who advocated them. Our work 
is not a mere guerilla warfare taken up 
against error and sin, and against the 
spiritual bondage of mankind. It is 
God's heavenly army of peace and of 
righteousness in the earth with all its 
companies battalions and divisions 
properly organized. Its movements re- 
mind one of the marching of the old 
Roman legions. It is God's spiritual 
kingdom, which is going to remain and 
prevail in the earth. And I love to 
think that when the nations shall as- 
semble in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ah- 
man, and when the Ancient of Days 



shall sit in honor and glory, when the 
Son of Man shall come in the clouds 
of heaven, accompanied by His Saints, 
there shall be one among them who 
afore time was known to this genera- 
tion, the Prophet Joseph Smith. He 
will be there, glorious among the 
mighty ones; honored among the Gods. 
In the very land where he was driven 
to and fro by his enemies there shall 
he triumph, there shall he stand a 
prince among his people, a prophet 
among the anointed of God, and the na- 
tions shall sing, as we sing now: 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah; 

Jesus anointed "that Prophet and 
Seer." 

Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations 
revere. 

Hail to the Prophet .ascended to hea- 
ven; 

Traitors and tyrants now fight him 
in vain; 

Mingling with Gods he can plan for his 
brethren; 

Death cannot conquer that hero 
again. 

This great work of ours — and of God's 
— for it is both His and ours — this work 
is the truth. And will it win? Why of 
course it will win. "For truth is truth, 
since God is God. and truth at the last 
must win. To doubt it were disloyalty; 
to falter would be sin." 

The Lord bless you. Amen.

throughout. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

It gives me pleasure to announce that, 
so far as my eye could detect, the vot- 
ing has been unanimous in favor of 
sustaining the officers whose names 
have been presented before the confer- 
ence. I now only need to express the 
hope that we will sustain by our faith 
and prayers, by our good works and 
words, and by our confidence and love, 
all these men and, women who are called 
tc officiate in these responsible positions 
in the Church, as we have sustained 
them this day by the lifting-up of our 
bands. 

May God help us to be united and 
strong for in union there is strength, 
and our strength will be made more 
and more manifest among men in pro- 
portion as we manifest our union and 
our love one for another, and for the 
children of men, and especially for the 
cause of Zion. God bless the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
God bless good and honest men every- 
where. May the blessing of peace rest 
upon our great nation. May the favor 
of the Lord accompany our people 
throughout the length and breadth of 
our broad land, and upon the islands 
or' the seas, where the benefits of our 
glorious government are being extend- 
ed for the uplifting of the heathen ana 
for the civilization of nations which 
have for ages dwelt in barbarism and 
ignorance. May God bless those who 
bless our nation and our people, and 
may the mercies of our Heavenly 
Father be extended unto our enemies 
and those who would overthrow us and 
wipe us out of existence if it were in

their power. May they repent that He 
may forgive them, open their eyes and 
soften their hearts, that they may fore- 
see the pits into which they are hast- 
ening, and that they may turn away 
from their sins in time to receive the 
clemency and mercy of our all-forgiv- 
ing Father, and be saved at last in His 
Kingdom. These are my prayers and 
my earnest desires in behalf of the peo- 
ple of God and of all the peoples of the 
earth, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOHN R. WINDER. 

It will be remembered that at our 
last conference a resolution was passed 
providing for a memorial to the mar- 
tyred Prophet and Patriarch. The plans 
have been prepared and are now in the 



hands of the trustee-in-trust, and the 
work will soon be commenced. We ex- 
pect to have it completed and ready 
for dedication on the anniversary of the 
birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
Dec. 23, 1905.

nah!" 

Benediction was pronounced by John 
Smith, presiding Patriarch of the

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Semi-Annual Conference, Held in the Tabernacle,. 
Sunday Evening, October 9, 1904. 



The conference was called to order by- 
President Joseph F. Smith, general su- 
perintendent. 

Singing by choir and congregation, 
"If there's sunshine in your heart." 

Prayer by Elder Josiah Burrows. 

Singing by the choir,"Peace, Be Still." 

General Secretary George D. Pyper 
called the roll of stakes. 

Assistant General Superintendent 
George Reynolds said a few reports 
from stake superintendents would first 
be called for, and in those reports he 
hoped the brethren would make refer- 
ence to the conventions that have been 
held In their midst, and give some idea 
of the results. 

SUPT. JOSEPH J. JACKSON, 
Of the Alpine Stake. 

My brethren and sisters, I can say 
that the Sunday school work is grow- 
ing in the Alpine Stake of Zion. Our 
convention, held in Provo, has done a 
wonderful work in the Sunday school 
cause. It has interested many who, 
before the convention, were lukewarm, 
and many who were idlers in Zion, who 
attended the convention, have become 
workers. The Sunday schools in the Al- 
pine stake are up to par. We have 70 
per cent of the children represented in 
our Sunday schools. "We have in at- 
tendance 73 per cent of teachers and of- 
ficers. This standard is not high 
enough for the teachers and officers; 
we feel that we ought to have at least 
85 per cent, for when any take upon 
them the high and holy calling of an 
officer or a teacher in the Sunday 
school, they then give their allegiance 
to God, to help roll on His glorious pur- 
poses upon the earth 



We have many Seventies who an* 
teachers in Sunday school, and 
it is an unpleasant thing to 
me to state, after being one of 
the presidents of seventy, that some of 
them are numbered among the 15 or 20 
per cent who do not attend to their 
duties in Sunday School. My brethren 
and sisters, the calling of the Seventy 
is to preach the Gospel at home as 
well as abroad. The calling of an El- 
der is to preach the Gospel at home 
as well as abroad. And we are trying 
to impress upon the minds of the breth- 
ren holding the holy priesthood that 
it is their duty to be in Sunday School, 
that they should be there at least 15 
minutes to 10 o'clock, that their ex- 
ample may go forth before the children 
and have its effect. 

In the Alpine stake we have 300 
teachers, most of whom are devoted to 
the cause. They love the Sunday 
School work, and it is through their 
love for the cause that we are enabled 
to have 70 per cent of the children in 
attendance. A year and a half ago 
there was only 49 per cent who at- 
tended the Sabbath School. Since that 
time we have taken up a labor with the 
parents; we have impressed upon their 
minds the revelation that is recorded 
in the Sixty-eighth section of the Doc- 
trine and Co /enants, on the relation of 
parents to children and of children to 
parents. We have tried to impress 
upon the minds of the parents that it is 
their duty to see that their children 
are in Sunday school, and it is their 
duty to teach their children the true 
and everlasting Gospel. During the 
14 ward conferences that we have- 



78 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



held in the Alpine stake, many of the 
Bishops have given us two and in some 
three, sessions, and during- the after- 
noon and the evening, we have called 
the parents together, and we have 
pointed out to them the necessity of 
sending their children to the Sunday 
school. We try to convert the parents, 
and I believe that there are now 50 per 
cent of the parents in the Alpine stake 
of Zion, who are converted to the work 
of the Sunday School. 

The "Outlines" have done a wonder- 
ful work. I believe that every school 
is furnished with them and is using 
them to good advantage 1 . There are 
fifteen schools in Alpine stake. We 
nave now organized a Sunday School 
in Manning, and we hope that in the 
near future we can again organize one 
in Sunshine. There are a few families 
there, and wherever there are a few 
families we organize a Sunday School, 
for we find much good comes from it. 
We have many good men and women 
in the Alpine stake of Zion. We have 
a splendid Union Board, and I believe 
they are all united, and love one an- 
other. We meet often, and we talk over 
the Sunday School cause in our stake 
and in other stakes, and if there are 
any points that we can grasp that will 
better our condition, we grasp them, for 
it is the desire of our hearts, to make 
the Sunday Schools of the Alpine stake 
of Zion as good as those of any stake in 
.the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We are working to that 
end, and if God will give unto us His 
Spirit and bless us, we will accomplish 
the desires of our hearts. 

I know that the work is true. I 
know that the Sunday school cause, is 
true, and I hope that there are no 
idlers under the sound of my voice, 
and that Zion will, not be condemned 
through the idlers that are in her, but 
that we may all become workers, not 
only in the Sunday School, but in Mu- 
tual Improvement and in Religion class 
work, and in whatever we may be 
called to do. God bless the noble cause 
of the Sunday School, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT E. 
D. HARRISON, 

Of the Pocatello Stake of Zion. 

My brethren and sisters, with you I 
rejoice in the Sabbath school work. 
Pocatello stake is situated very peculi- 
arly to be successful in the work that 
is given to us by the General Board 
from time to time. Pocatello is situ- 
ated nearly in the middle of the stake. 
The farthest school to the northwest is 
47 miles away, the farthest school to 
the south is 50 miles. The nearest 
school to Pocatello is 12 miles away, 
the next it 25. It means a railroad 
fare of $1.40 to $2.60 each time that any 
member of the board makes a trip. We 
have raised no funds for this purpose 
in our stake, but we have paid it out 
of our own pockets, and each of us is 
laboring to maintain himself and fam- 
ily in Pocatello, and when we leave it 
means additional expense besides our 
railroad fare, for many times we have 
to pay some one to care for the inter- 
ests or the labor that we are engaged 
in, while we attend to the Sabbath 
school work. This is the condition of 
some of the members of the Sabbath 
School Board. 

We have 17 schools in the Pocatello 
stake, but only 10 wards. There have 
been branch schools organized, and 
they have been very small, but they 
have accomplished some good, and they 
have gone along, struggling under the 
conditions in which they were placed, 
and they have all kept up the interest, 
excepting two, which have died a na- 
tural death' through neglect. 

The average attendance of our offi- 
cers has been a trifle over 50 per cent. 
There is scarcely a school, excepting 
the one situated' at Pocatello, where 
they do not live from a mile to nine 
miles from the place where the school 
meets. The consequence is, that the 
conditions that they have to meet are 
anything but the best, and the attend- 
ance is not so great, as it would be if 
they were better. 

The pupils on an average attend at 
the rate of 60 per cent. The weather 
and the busy times and seasons have 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL. UNION. 



79 



much to do with the attendance in our 
schools. We hold a union meeting' in the 
south one month, and in the west the 
next month. Our Sunday School 
workers are not yet fully converted to 
the Union meeting's, but I will say that 
they have taken great interest, and 
there has been some zeal manifested 
isince we had our conventionwhich.while 
not a glaring success, was at least a 
profitable thing to all who attended. 
We were combined with the Bannock 
stake. In the Bannock stake the near- 
est school is something over 45 miles 
from Pocatello, and the farthest is 
about SO. 

Our convention work was positive- 
ly a successful thing to all who at- 
tended, but we labored under great 
difficulties at that particular time. We 
had a fair or a carnival that week. We 
had a circus there the same week, and 
the people came in to the carnival and 
circus, and by the time Saturday came 
for our convention, they were worn 
out and their friends who entertained 
them were worn out, and many of the 
people went home, not waiting for the 
convention. 

I will say that all of the Sunday 
School workers in our stake are earn- 
est and sincere in their work, and I 
believe that they do the very best 
they can under the circumstances, and 
I certaintly have a very high esteem 
for every worker in our stake, for I 
know that they all try to do their best. 

I feel somewhat encouraged of, late, 
because we have had a little better 
success in our Union meeting^. We 
have had more in attendance, and we 
have succeeded better in presenting the 
ideas that will tend to the end of get- 
ting better teachers, which will make 
better classes and better Sunday school 
pupils. 

I ask God to add His blessings to all 
the Sabbath school workers. 

ELDER E. C. PHILLIPS, 

Of the St. Joseph Stake. 

My brethren and sisters, in reporting 
the condition of the Sunday schools of 



the St. Joseph Stake, I desire to be 
prompted by the Spirit of our Heaven- 
ly Father. 

Up to the present time we have had 
no convention; but we hold our union 
meetings once a month, and we have a 
good attendance. We there conduct 
classes and give general instruc- 
tions to the Sunday school workers. 

We have sixteen Sunday schools in 
our stake, and some of them are far 
removed from the headquarters of our 
stake, one of them being about 150 
miles away. But it has been my pleas- 
ure to visit all the Sunday schools of 
the St. Joseph Stake in the last seven 
or eight months, and I have found 
them all in very good condition, al- 
though some of them have not as good 
an attendance as we would wish. 

Our average attendance, I think, is 
about 50 per cent. We have 1,890 Sun- 
day school teachers, officers and pu- 
pils; and the teachers as a rule are try- 
ing to inform themselves on the best 
methods of Sunday school work. Since 
we have had the "Outlines," our Sun- 
day school work has improved wonder- 
fully, so much so that it seems to me 
that now we could hardly do without 
them. 

We have held most of our ward con- 
ferences this, summer, and we are now 
holding parents' conventions, which 
are doing a great deal of good for the 
children. The stake superintendent 
and his assistants are united in their 
labor for the betterment of the Sunday 
school work. We also have a good 
Union Board that can hardly be beaten 
in any stake. 

I wish to bear my testimony to 
the truthfulness of the Gospel. I know 
that it is true, and that if we, as Lat- 
ter-day Saints and Sunday school 
workers will live up to its precepts, we 
shall gain an exaltation in our Father's 
kingdom. And may the instructions 
that we have heard in our conference 
find lodgment in our hearts, and do us 
the good that it is intended they should 
do, is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT 
CHARLES J. ROSS. 

(Of the Weber Stake.) 

The greatest pleasure that I have in 
this life, my brethren and sisters, is to 
say a good word for the work in which 
I am engaged. I have been actively 
engaged in the Sunday school work for 
a great number of years, and I want 
to state that I thoroughly enjoy it. 

In the Weber stake we have enrolled 
7,713 pupils. We have an average at- 
tendance of 70 per cent of pupils, with 
an average of punctuality of 85 per 
cent. The per cent of teachers and of- 
ficers is 75. We have 30 schools in the 
stake, and in each ward except two. 
we hold a 9:30 o'clock prayer meeting. 
First of all the roll is called, then a 
hjmn is sung, then we pray. 
These prayer meetings, as sug- 
gested by the General Board, 
we find of untold benefit to our 
officers and teachers, and it has a ten- 
dency to increase the punctuality, not 
only of the officers and teachers, but of 
the pupils. We hold our regular week- 
ly board meetings each Tuesday night, 
never failing. We hold our regular lo- 
cal Sunday School board meetings in 
each ward one night a week. At these 
board meetings, a great deal of good is 
done. We find that it is impossible for 
active Sunday School workers to be 
thoroughly prepared with their duties 
for the Sunday morning, unless they 
are in attendance at these weekly meet- 
ings, unless they come with an out- 
line prepared, and are ready to discuss 
and bring out all points pertaining to 
the lesson or work to be developed and 
impressed upon the minds of the child- 
ren. These meetings are indeed of un- 
told value to the Sunday school work- 
ers of the Weber stake. 

We are holding Sunday school con- 
ventions throughout our stake, usually 
four weeks apart, we meet at a desig- 
nated place on the Sunday afternoon, 
and there we have our opening exercis- 
es, and then adjourn to department 
work, where we have an enjoyable time 
developing lessons, instructing our 
teachers and our officers along the lines 
that are most beneficial and most 



adapted to bring out the individuality. 
The stake district convention, held in 
Ogden, was indeed a most glorious 
thing for the Weber stake, and I want 
to say that the Weber stake will wel- 
come another convention, no matter 
where it may be held. We hope to have 
one, and will welcome it with open 
arms. 

We could not get along without the 
Outlines, and we have something like 
3,000 of them distributed among the pu- 
pils and in the hands of the parents. 
We are trying to encourage home 
preparation, and I believe that we are 
doing well in this regard. 

Our Parents' Conventions, which we 
have held in every ward in the stake, 
have resulted in a very great deal of 
good to home preparation work. We 
have interested the parents in many, 
many cases. We are striving to get 
more of the home in the Sunday 
school, and more of the Sunday school 
in the home. When we can accomplish 
this, we feel that we have done some 
good. 

We hope to be able to work along the 
lines suggested by the General Board. 
I pray God's blessings upon them and 
upon all Sunday school workers, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Bro. William D. Philips sang a beau- 
tiful sacred solo, entitled, "Come unto 
me all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden." 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

I am asked to occupy a few minutes 
in addressing myself to the stake 
boards and superintendents particular- 
ly, and the topic assigned me is that 
of grading the classes. 

In the "Outlines" that have been fur- 
nished you, you find a suggestion as 
to the basis upon which this grading 
shall be effected. For example, you 
read that the kindergarten department 
shall be graded on the basis of age, 
from the end of the fourth year to the 
end of the sixth; the primary depart- 
ment, from seven years to eight years A 
inclusive, that is, from the beginning of 
the seventh to the end of the eighth*; 
the first intermediate, from the ninth to 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL, UNION. 



81 



the twelfth, inclusive; second inter- 
mediate, from the thirteenth to the six- 
teenth, inclusive; and the theological 
from the seventeenth year upward. I 
find it here seventeen to twenty, but I 
have always allowed myself to fancy 
that that is a misprint, and that a zero 
has been left out, and that it means 
from seventeen to two hundred, because 
I have not yet learned that there is 
any fixed age beyond which one may 
not attend, and we want the man of 90 
and 100, if he is able to come along, to 
be there. 

But the fact is, as it has come to the 
notice and knowledge of the board and 
its officers, that some superintendents 
are applying this suggestion according 
to the letter, rather than the spirit 
thereof; and they think that all the 
members of the Sunday school must be 
graded according to their ages, and 
that there is no other qualification to 
consider. Grading would be an easy 
matter indeed if that were a true prin- 
ciple. I wonder how those in charge of 
large educational institutions would feel 
if such a course were allowable. I know 
that in the state university, we should 
be saved a great deal of work if, as 
soon as a student presents himself, we 
required only a proper certificate of 
age, and then classed him accordingly. 
But we have to follow a different plan. 
We have to take the student in hand, 
whether he has just come from the lower 
grade schools or, perhaps, has reached 
an advanced stage in college work, and 
examine him very carefully to find out 
where he belongs. We ma^ make mis- 
takes, ofttimes do, without doubt, but 
we try to do the best we can, and place 
the student accordingly. Then you say, 
what need of making any suggestion on 
the basis of age There is great need 
and good need for it^. There is a law, if 
you please, founded upon a true prin- 
ciple that, all other things being equal, 
the older the boy or the girl, the more 
he will know. Now there are excep- 
tions to that law. We find that the 
varying ability of the individual stu- 
dent will sometimes offset what would 
seem to be a state of advancement 
based on age. I have seen in a few 



cases injury done by over-zealous su- 
perintendents who were determined to 
follow the letter of that principle and 
not consider the spirit in which it is 
suggested. And yet I find that the 
general superintend iicy, in putting out 
these outlines, has taken occasion to 
have printed in italics, and in a very 
prominent place, "The ages assigned are 
only suggestive." That has been ovei- 
looked in many cases. We find oft- 
times that young boys and young girls, 
of age entitling them to membership in 
the higher intermediate departments, 
may reasonably be given work in the 
lower of the theological classes; and I 
say you cannot grade properly, super- 
intendents, you cannot do it, unless you 
have the spirit of your calling with 
you; such, however, will give you that 
good, sound common sense that will en- 
able you to interpret this suggestion in 
the spirit of it and grade your pupils 
accordingly. 

I venture to call attention io the fact 
that we are not to mistake superficial 
preparation for actual preparation. We 
find some pupils who can read well, and 
who are therefore placed in a class 
higher than the one to which they 
rightfully belong. The question is, does 
the student understand what he reads. 
Don't put a pupil in a class beyond his 
grade, and don't go to the other ex- 
treme. I have seen in many of our dis- 
trict schools, and in our Church schoots 
young men of even middle age enter, 
lacking much in the way of primary 
preparation; and I have always re- 
joiced that in those schools, something 
other than age, or scholarship alone 
had to be considered, for I have seen 
such men put into a special class with 
a special teacher, rather than have 
them humiliated by putting them down 
just where they belonged upon the basis 
of a question of examination as to 
strict scholarship. 

Let Wisdom rule in all things, and if 
you are in doubt, and you really don't 
know how to decide, there are others 
with whom you may counsel; more- 
over the channel of prayer is always 
open to you, and you have a right to 
ask and expect the inspiration of the

Lord to lead you in the performance of 
your duties. 

A great teacher was once asked, al- 
though he was a specialist, a professor 
of one subject, "Hew many classes have 
you every day?" And he said, "Eigh- 
teen, sir." His questioner was sur- 
prised. "Eighteen classes in a day?" 
"Yes, eighteen every day." But the in- 
quirer soon found that he had one class 
of 18 members, every one of whom was 
a separate class to him. He didn't 
bunch them all together and measure 
them by the same rc%. He inquired in- 
to the capabilities of each, felt of the 
spirit of each, and learned to study and 
understand each, then acted according- 
ly. Sunday school teachers, you have 
just as many classes on your hands as 
you have pupils, if you are doing your 
duty, and you should know much about 
them individually; then you can assist 
the superintendent if he comes with 
questions as to the grading and placing 
of this student or that. 

Now don't understand me as offering 
unfavorable criticism. Judging from the 
reports that have been made, here to- 
night by stake superintendents, there is 
little cause for fault finding; for all 
testified that they are getting along so 
well — they did not say the rest, but I 
will finish it — that they can and will do 
a great deal better. I believe, too, that 
all they have said is true. I have visit- 
ed some of the stakes reported, have 
had that privilege and pleasure, and 
know that the reports are true, for I 
know that the schools there are of a 
high standard; and I believe that the 
schools throughout Zion are of a high 
standard, and I believe that we are 
.connected with a living, growing cause. 
Yet there are some points in connection 
with which we may do a great deal 
better. 

I call to mind an experience of my 
own when I was visiting in the capacity 
of a stake officer a certain Sunday 
school years ago, and found a number 
of the older brethren gathered together 
into a class, and they were flocking by 
themselves in a little room down in the 
basement. There was one exception — 
a nine year old boy who was 



also a member of the class. They wei ■> 
studying Josephus, a very good work, 
but hardly suitable as a Sunday sCllOci 
text-book, however valued it may be as 
a reference work for preparation. They 
had clubbed together and had bought 
these books, and were reading Jo- 
se phus. I asked the superintendent 
how it was that that boy was there 
with those veterans, and suggested that 
possibly it was a little out of order. 
"Why," said he, "he can read as well 
as the best of them, and he has bought 
a book, too." Now I don't believe thar 
that was an extreme case illustrative of 
conditions years ago. I don't believe 
you could find an instance of that kind 
in all the schools today. We know 
there is something in the method of 
grading, but we must not carry the 
matter too far. The best of principles 
may be hurtfully and injuriously ap- 
plied. We do not always realize that. 
We are trying to inculcate the principle 
and the piactice of punctuality, but 1 
have seen that principle carried so far, 
or at least have seen it so misapplied 
as to do injury; for example, I have 
known superintendents who have said, 
"If you can't get here on time, don't 
come; we are going to close the doors; 
we are not going to be disturbed by 
late comers." Now they may be correct 
under some few conditions, but I say to 
my class, and I have charge of a Sun- 
day school class every Sunday, "If you 
can't possibly be here at ten o'clock.and 
can get here five minutes afterward, 
come; don't be late if you can possi- 
bly help it, but come; and if you can't 
get here until half-past ten, come then, 
if you have any good excuse for being 
late. If you have an excuse that is 
worth anything when judged by your 
own conscience, it is of avail when we 
judge you according to the rule, and 
we wish you to come." I don't want 
to see punctuality carried to such an 
extreme as to make it appear that when 
anyone is late, he is unwelcome, provid- 
ed he has a good excuse. And so with 
every rule. So many mistakes arc- 
made in this .world, through men tak- 
ing laws to be rules and rules to be 
laws. We do not want you to take a

fifteen year old. boy and put him in 
the primary department. There is a 
place provided for him. He belongs in 
the second intei mediate, if he is well up 
to date in his prepai'ation. And pa- 
rents should co-operate in aiding to 
keep these students up to date, up to 
their age limit and grade in preparation. 
I sincerely trust that the suggestion will 
be taken in good part, and that you 
will try to grade according to ability 
and age. Do not needlessly hurt the 
pupil's feelings. Do not put him back 
and make him repeat a course of study 
if with profit he can be promoted to a 
higher one. 

I say again, brethren, let us have the 
spirit of our calling with us, and we 
will be able to interpret the spirit of 
these suggestions, the spirit in which 
they are offered; and may we rejoice in 
that spirit and In the results that fol- 
low it, as it accompanies our labors. 
Amen.

ories of Galilee. 

ELDER WILLIAM A. MORTON. 

I am sure the Lord knows how hard 
it is for me to stand up before this vast 
congregation, and I sincerely trust that 
He will bless me with a portion of His 
Holy Spirit. I feel at home in a pri- 
mary class, but this primary class is 
too large for me. 

I am going to tell you a little of my 
experience. But before doing so I 
want to thank you, my brethren and 
sisters, for sustaining me in the posi- 
tion to which I have been called. I 
thank the General Board and the pre- 
siding officers of the Church that they 
have considered me worthy to be identi- 
fied with the Sunday school movement. 
I cannot believe my eyes. Why, it seems 
to me but a year or two since I was 
a little, barefoot boy, sitting on a bench 
in a Sunday school in the north of Ire- 
land, listening to Bible stories told me 
by my teacher, and it seems almost in- 
credible that I am here tonight before 
this great assembly. 

I want to speak a good word for my 
first Sunday school teacher. She did 
(Vol belong to the Church, but she loved 



little boys. She used to come to Sunday 
school, gather us around her, and teach 
us the Gospel of Jesus Christ as far as 
she knew it. 1 have not seen her for 
twenty-five years, but a little while ago 
I sat down and wrote her a letter, in 
which I said, "Teacher, I haven't seen 
you for twenty-five years, and yet I see 
you all the time. I see myself as a boy, 
sitting at your feet in that Sunday 
school; I see your smiling face; I hear 
your loving voice, as you tell me of the 
love of God, and teach me to love Him 
and keep His commandments. And now 
I thank you for what you did for me. 
Some time, somewhere, in eternity I 
will find you, and then I will tell you 
face to face how much I appreciate the 
interest you took in me, and try to re- 
pay you tor all the kindness you be- 
stowed upon me." 

Yes, that teacher loved us, and I be- 
lieve she took a special interest in me; 
I believe the Lord inspired her to do so. 
She used to take her little class to her 
home, where she would serve us with 
lemonade and cake, and then tell us 
stories about the Lord Jesus. 

I learned to love her; I love her still. 
She is a member of the Presbyterian 
church, but I know that the Lord loves 
her, because she is a good woman. All 
women are good, but 1 believe some are 
just a little better than others, and I 
think she belonged to the latter class. 

I want to appeal to you teachers — 
you teachers who sometimes get dis- 
couraged; you teachers who sometimes 
feel cross; you teachers who feel like 
sending the little boys home— don't do 
it. Be patient with them a little long- 
er. Take them to the Lord in prayer. 
You don't know who you are teaching 
Let us try to remember that we wer's 
once boys and girls, some of us not 
near so good as the boys and girls we 
are teaching. But we have begun to 
lcok at things a little differently. We 
have acquired a little more common 
sense; we are not making the fools of 
ourselves we did then, and after a while 
v\e teachers will see the results of our 
labors and feel satisfied. 

A Religion class teacher came to me 
one day. She said she could not see any 



84 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



results from her work. I said to her, 
"You do not want to be always going 
around looking for results. When you 
do good you should go away back into 
the shade and lie down, and tell no one 
about it. All you have to do is to sow 
the seeds; God will take care of the 
crop." That day in the testimony ex- 
ercise, after the teacher had borne her 
testimony, she said, "Do any of you 
little children feel like thanking God for 
the good things He gives you, or like 
bearing your testimony?" One little girl 
arose and said, "I want to say some- 
thing." Let me say, before I tell you 
what she said, that the teacher had 
been teaching a memory gem — "Honor 
thy father and thy mother, that thy 
days may be long in the land which 
the Lord thy God giveth thee." The lit- 
tle child continued, "Last Wednesday 
afternoon, when I went home from the. 
Religion class, my mama said to me, 
'Will you go down to the store for me?' 
I said 'No, mama, I don't want to go 
to the store,' and mama said, 'Then I 
will go myself. Will you go down and 
feed the chickens for me?' I said. 'Yes, 
I will go down and feed the chickens. 
As I was on my way something said 
to me 'You are not honoring and obey- 
ing your parents,' so I came back and 
said, 'Mama, I will go to the store 
for you.' Then she put her arms around 
my neck and kissed me, and after that 
I felt better." 

I said to the teacher at the close of 
the session, '-'What better results do 
you wish to see than that? You have 
taught these children a little memory 
gem for three weeks, and today you 
have seen it bring forth fruit. You 
have taught a lesson which I believe 
will remain in that child's heart as 
long as she lives." 

We are making great progress in 
Sunday school work, and there are none 
who are more delighted with the work 
that. is being accomplished than is the 
General Board. We are growing by 
leaps and bounds. We are far in ad- 
vance of what we were a few years 
ago. Some of us teachers used to think 
that sufficient for the day was the les- 
son thereof; but we know .better than 



that now. We have learned that we 
must grow and grow, and never cease 
to grow, for when growth ceases, death 
begins. 

But are not some of us going just to 
the other extreme? I believe that we 
are burning the midnight oil in making 
preparations, and studying very hard, 
and we are so concerned about the 
preparation of the lesson, and the very 
best method of presenting it that I fear 
we are not giving the proper atten- 
tion to the spirit of the lesson. There is 
such a thing as being too careful, you 
know. I was in Sister Kesler's kinder- 
garten class last week, and one of the 
members of the class illustrated how it 
was possible to be too careful. She 
said one day her mother sent her down 
into the cellar with a pitcher of cream, 
and said to her, "Be careful that you 
do not let the pitcher fall." She said, 
"I went out and I was holding that 
pitcher as tight as I co-.i 1 ^ hold it, and 
just when I got on the first step 
of the cellar stairs I let the pitcher 
fair, and it broke into a dozen pieces. 
I was so concerned about the pitcher, 
and so careful that it shouldn't fall, 
that I actually let it fall." I believe 
there are a few teachers who are so 
much interested in the preparation of 
the lesson, in the method of presenting 
it, that they are losing sight of the 
spirit of it. I visited a Sunday school 
recently, and listened to some very 
good lessons, but there did not seem 
to be a soul in them. They were a com- 
pilation of cold, dry facts, and failed 
to touch the souls of the pupils. I 
believe that if our lessons are to accom- 
plish the good we want them to accom- 
plish they must touch the heart; the 
lesson that fails to in this has not ac- 
complished its mission. I am afraid 
some Sunday school teachers do not 
let the lessons go through their own 

hearts. Every teacher shoulld say, 
when he takes up a lesson: "What is 
there in this lesson for me? What is 
there in it that I can apply to myself, 
and make part of myself before at- 
tempting to present it to my class?" 
Our lessons ought to go through our 
own selves to our pupils. What I think 



v 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

is needed is the spirit of Sunday school 
work, the soul of the work. 

I was away from Zion some time ago, 
in a large city. It was Sunday morn- 
'^ing. There were no Saints there, but 
I decided that I would go and worship 
somewhere, and I went to a Christian 
church. I listened to a minister who 
said many good things, and I accepted 
the good things which he said and let 
the others go. He said, "Some time ago 
a young man arrived at a port in Am- 
erica. When he landed an officer went 
up to him and said, 'How much money 
have you got!' T haven't got a dollar 
in the world' was the reply. 'Where are 
you going to?' asked the officer. 'I am 
going to Fall River,' he answered. 
'Have you got any relatives here?' was 
the next question. 'No,' was the reply; 
'but I have some in Fall River.' 'You 
must go back,' said the officer. 'Why?' 
asked the young man. 'Because you are 
without money and relatives here, and 
you are liable to become a public 
charge.' The young man looked at him 
and said, 'I will not become a public 
charge. Give me a chance and I will 
get down to Fall River all right.' 
'How?' asked the officer. 'By this,' said 
the young man, as he tapped a little 
bag under his arm. 'What have you 
got there?' the officer questioned. 
Opening the bag, the young man drew 
out a beautiful cornet, and putting it 
to his lips he played a tune of one 
of the grand old masters, a tune that, 
brought tears to the eyes of all who 
heard it. When he had finished, the of- 
ficer said to the captain of the vessel, 
'Take this man down to Fall River at 
my expense.' 'No,' said the captain, 
'he shall go to Fall River at my ex- 
pense; I need just such a man on 
board,' and that young man went to 
Fall River because he put his soul into 
his instrument." I want to say teach- 
ers, that if we expect to make a success 
of our Sunday school work we must put 
nur souls into it. 

One time a young artist painted a 
picture and took it to a critic for his 
inspection. The older artist inspected 
it, and then took up his brush and 
gave it a daub. The young man stared 



at him in astonishment and said, "Why 
did you do that?" "Your picture lacks 
one thing," said the artist. "And what 
does it lack," inquired the youth. "The 
touch of a master hand," was the re- 
ply. And that is just what your les- 
sons sometimes lack, the touch of the 
Master's hand. 

God, in the beginning, decreed that 
man should eat his bread by the sweat 
of his brow. That was not a curse, it 
was one of the greatest blessings that 
God ever gave to man. And if God will 
not give bread to the man who spends 
his days in idleness, neither will He put 
words of wisdom and inspiration into 
the mouth of a mental drone. In sit- 
ting down to prepare our lessons we 
should invoke His divine assistance and 
then when we have finished we should 
go to Him and say, "Father, I have 
done what I could; now fill my soul 
with Your Spirit; inspire me for my 
work, give this picture the touch of 
Thy master hand."And he will do it. 
He will help us every time. 

Before taking my seat I wish to refer 
to a statement that was made in a 
Methodist convention held last week. 
I have traveled quite extensively ovei 
this country, and have associated ft 
great deal with the young people of 
Zion, and I can say truthfully that 
there is no people in God's great world 
today who love their religion as the 
young people of the Latter-day Saints 
do. We have one hundred and thirty 
thousand members enrolled in our 
Sunday Schools, and we have not had 
to use "trading stamps" to get them 
there either. Brother Summerhays has 
an extract from a newspaper in his 
pocket which shows that some of the 
sectarian schools of the country have 
had to resort to the trading stamp sys- 
tem in order to get their young people 
to attend Sunday schools. We haven't 
got down as low as that yet. We never 
shall. 

We are not ashamed of the Gospel, 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, nor of 
jf the Prophet Joseph Smith, nor of 
<;he glorious principles which he taught 
us, but I will tell you of whom we are 
ashamed. We are ashamed of 



86 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



men and women who claim to be fol- 
lowers of the meek and lowly Jesus, 
and at the same time go about 
speaking evil of their neighbors, 
and seeking to do them all the injury 
they can. That is what we are ashamed 
of. We are ashamed to see men who 
style themselves ministers of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, assemble in conventions 
and pass resolutions aiming at the per- 
secution, the oppression, the annihila- 
tion of a little band of religious wor- 
shipers in their own land. A short 
time ago the ministers of the country 
shed crocodile tears because of the per- 
secutions of the Jews by the Russians. 
They also passed resolutions condemn- 
ing the latter for their treatment of the 
poor Hebrews. You remember th.it 
some of the nations were appealed to 
to arise and show their disapproval of 
the treatment accorded the Jews by th^ 
Russians, and now we find some of 
these ministers who were so strong in 
their denunciation of the Russians for 
persecuting the Jews, assemble in con- 
vention and pass resolutions by which 
they seek to persecute and overthrow 
a little band of religious worshipers 
out here in the desert. Think of it! 
That is what we are ashamed of, of 
such inconsistency. Sometimes I im- 
agine I can see the devil, lying back in 
his easy chair and laughing at the in- 
consistency of these theological hypo- 
crites. 

I pray God to bless the youth of 
Zion; to bless the boys and girls of the 
new and everlasting covenant. We 
have been called to teach these chil- 
dren; let us labor for their salvation. 
These little boys and girls in the kin- 
dergarten classes, these little boys and 
girls in the primary classes, will not 
be little boys and girls always... After 
a while they will be grown-ups, and 
will become great and good men and 
women. We shall see them bearing off 
the kingdom of God. I can see them, 
when you and I are laid away on the 
hillside, rising up and doing a thous- 
and times better work than you and I 
;n-e doing today. We are teaching 
Apostles and Prophets of the Most 
High God. We do not know now who 



these little ones are. but God knows 
them, and the day will come when they 
will rise up and bless us, if we but do 
our duty to them and teach them to 
live pure and holy lives. 

May God bless this great wor*". fcnd* 
may we labor with our who'.e might, 
mind and strength for the unbuilding 
of the kingdom of God. And, Anally, 
may we be redeemed, saved and exalt- 
ed with the sanctified in the celestial 
kingdom of our Father, is my humble 
prayer for us all, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. SUMMERHAYS. 

I am requested to say a few words 
in regard to the conventions which we 
have held during the past season, and 
what we intend to do during the year 
1905. I wish to say to our brethren 
and sisters from the far south, that we 
have not forgotten them. We have held 
conventions all through the north, ex- 
cept in the Union and Cassia stakes, 
and those two will have our immediate 
attention. We ai'e also making prepar- 
ation to visit the stakes in Arizona. 
Colorado and Old Mexico, and we ex- 
pect to do something for San Juan, but 
we hardly think it will be a conven- 
tion. 

At our conventions we have asked the 
sisters to take off their hats in the 
general meetings, and they have re- 
sponded as you have responded tonight. 
And then we have asked them to do 
another thing. We have asked them to 
let their hats remain off their heads 
until the benediction is offez-ed, and 
not to disturb the meeting by putting 
en their hats and getting ready to leave 
the house before the services were clos- 
ed. So far we have met with success 
and we would like you to do the same 
tonight. 

My brethren and sisters, this is the 
house of God, where we come to listen 
to the servants of God. and it is be- 
coming in us that we remain with due 
decorum until the benediction is offer- 
ed. 

On last Thursday evening we held a 
meeting at the P»arratt hall, and it was 
decided by the superintendents of the 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



ST 



stakes there assembled that we would 
continue our conventions during the 
coming year. We may have to group 
the stakes a little differently from 
what we grouped them du\i'ing the 
present season, but we expect that the 
conventions next season will be all 
that they have been this season, and as 
much better as we can possibly make 
them. 

Another point that I am requested to 
speak upon, and that is this, that the 
superintendents of stakes and the su- 
pei intendents of wards will note, that 
when their reports come to them this 
season, there is a change in some of the 
questions. We have been asking, if you 
remember, "What is your enrollment," 
and "What is your average attend- 
ance," and then we have asked for one 
hundred per cent on nickel fund ac- 
count. The result of this has been 
that some superintendents have taken 
from the roll every name they could, to 
show — first, a high average attendance, 
and secondly to more easily pay their 
one hundred per cent nickel fund; and 
a good many children between the ages 
of four and twenty have found their 
names taken from the roll, and they 
haven't gone back to school. We esti- 
mated the other day, just how many of 
this class of people were out of the 
Sabbath school, and we were of the 
opinion that there were some three 
thousand, eight hundred, with two hun- 
dred and fifty-six schools to hear from. 
This is wrong. So far as I am person- 
ally concerned, if I have got a boy that 
is not true to his trust, I would rather 
that that boy should come to the Sun- 
day School but once a year than not to 
come at all. We are not so much after 
the average attendance or the nickels 
as we are after the salvation of the 
souls of those children. We want to 
get them into the Sunday School. 
Therefore, when you get your next re- 
port blanks, you will find this question: 
"How many persons have you iji your 
ward between the ages of folic and 
twenty years, inclusive?" also, "How 
many of these are there enrolled in 
your Sunday School?" We ask these 
two questions, and, later on, my breth- 



ren, between now and the first of the 
year, we will tell you what we want 
you to do with this class of citizens. 

The majority of the members of the 
General Board have been through the 
stakes this season to these different 
conventions. I myself have attended 
all of them but two, and I know tha t 
the Sunday school cause is thriving, 
and I know that the great Latter-day 
work is growing. We recognize that 
Zion is growing, and 1 believe that ev- 
ery department is growing. I want to 
say to you Sunday school people, while 
you are attending to this organization, 
do not forget the other organizations of 
the Church — the Mutual Improvement, 
the Religion Classes and all. We want 
you to build up the kingdom of God 
in its entirety, that it may be beauti- 
ful to look upon when we present it to 
the Master. May God help us to do 
it, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

I do not desire to occupy very much 
time. I am delighted always to have 
the privilege of meeting with that class 
of our people who are so deeply inter- 
ested in teaching the children and in 
taking part in the work of the Sabbath 
Schools, and I sincerely hope that we 
shall succeed in impressing upon 
the minds of the rising gener- 
ation a sincere regard, not only 
for themselves, to keep themselves 
pure and unspotted from the world, 
but a sincere regard for the rights and 
privileges of others. Our children 
should be taught to respect not only 
their fathers and their* mothers, and 
their brothers and sisters, but they 
should be taught to respect all man- 
kind, and especially should they be in- 
structed and taught and brought up to 
honor the aged and the infirm, the un- 
fortunate and the pooi\ the needy and 
those who need the sympathies of 
mankind. 

We too frequently see a disposition 
on the part of our children to make 
fun of the unfortunate. A poor cripple, 
or a poor, weak-minded person comes

along, and the boys will poke fun at 
him. arid make unbecoming remarks 
about him. This is entirely wrong-, 
and such a spirit as this should never 
be witnessed among- the children of 
the Latter-day Saints. They ought to 
be taught better at home. They should 
be thoroughly taught better than this 
in our Sunday schools, and in all the 
schools, as far as that is concerned, 
that our children attend. Our children 
should be taught to venerate that 
which is holy, that which is sacred. 
They should venerate the name of 
God. They should hold in sacred ven- 
eration the name of the Son of God. 
They should not take Their holy nan.e^ 
in vain ; and they should also be taught 
to respect and venerate the temples of 
God. the places of worship of their 
fathers and mothers. Our children 
should be taught also that they have 
l ights in the house of the Lord equal to 
their parents and equal to their neigh- 
bors or anybody else. 

It always pains me to see our little 
ones disturbed in this right. I wit- 
nessed a little circumstance in our 
meeting this afternoon. The house 
was crowded in every part. A person 
was standing in the aisle, and a little 
child was sitting by its mother on a 
seat. Somebody came along and took 
the little child off its seat, and took the 
seat himself, leaving the child to stand. 
I want to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that that act sent a pang to my 
heart. I would not, for anything in the 
shape of remuneration of a worldly 
character, grieve the heart of a little 
child in the house of God, lest an im- 
pression should be left upon its mind 
that would make the house of worship 
a distasteful place, and it would prefer 
not to come within its walls, than to 
come and be offended. 

I once witnessed a circumstance of 
the kind in one of our most popular 
meetinghouses, I may say. A little 
child had come in, in good season, and 
taken a seat. By and by a lady came 
in. The seats seemed to be all occu- 
pied. She took the child by the arm, 
jerked it off the seat, and sat down up- 



on it herself, leaving the child to stand. 
I had all I could do to hold my tongue 
i.itu niy temper when I witnessed the 
circumstance. 1 had half a mind to 
get up and ask that lady to get up off 
that seat and let that child sit there. It 
had more right to sit there than she 
had, for it came and had it first, and 
was in the house of the Lord. The 
child was made to feel that it had no 
light there. It A\as made to feel that 
that person that came in later had a 
better claim to the seat than the child 
itP'-lf. That is wrong. Our children 
have just as much right to come into 
the house of God as an v. person has. 
and we should respect them in that 
right ourselves, and in turn the chil- 
dren will respect us. But when we 
cease to respect the lights of little 
children, it is a lesson to them which 
we inculcate in their minds, that they 
are not bound to respect us. But when 
we respect them, treat them as intelli- 
gent beings, treat them as our suc- 
cessors in life and entitled to respon- 
sibilities in life, they will grow up to 
respect us and hold us in reverence, 
and. respect our rights just as we re- 
spect theirs. 

I desire that we will inculcate this 
principle of esteem in the hearts of 
our children for their parents, for their 
brothers and sisters, for their neigh- 
bors and their associates, and especial- 
ly for those whom the Lord has called 
and clothed with authority to adminis- 
ter in the midst of the people. I think 
our children should be taught these 
principles, that they should be instilled 
into their hearts, and as we have been 
hearing tonight from Brother Morton, 
it should be a part of their nature to 
love one another and respect one an- 
other, to respect that which is sacred, 
that which has been consecrated to the 
worship of the Lord or to sacred pur- 
poses. 

Our children should be made and 
taught to respect these things in the 
Sunday schools. There is where you 
can teach them, and in our religion 
class work they can be taught these 
principles, more especially in these or-

ganizations; and also in the primary 
associations, better perhaps than they 
can be anywhere else, because they 
are taken in these associations at the 
ages when they are most impression- 
able, and when these things can be 
made permanent in their minds. The 
things that are impressed upon the 
minds of children take stronger hold 
than in after or later life. 

Well now, my brethren and sisters, 
let us respect one another. Let us re- 
spect that which is sacred. Let us 
honor the name of the Father and of 
the Son. Let us speak kindly of one 
another. Speak no ill of any man, no 
matter if such men are not what they 
should be; it does no good for us to 
promulgate and publish abroad and 
keep alive in our memories or in the 
memories of others the imperfections, 
the sins and the wrong doings of oth- 
ers. We had better strive to amend 
and improve that which is not good. 
Always seek that which is better, and 
that which will purify the heart and 
ennoble the mind, and that will lead 
men to higher thoughts, higher aspira- 
tions and better and purer work in the 



world, that they may become more and 
more like the Son of God. 

May the Lord bless -all those who 
work in the Sunda TT schools, and help 
them in the performance of their du- 
ties, and bless the children of Zion, 
that what has been said tonight, and 
what was said today, may indeed be 
true of them, that they are not ashamed 
of their parents, that they are not 
ashamed of their religion, that they are 
not ashamed of the work their parents 
have done in the land, but that they 
are proud of these things, and that 
they venerate their parents because of 
their fidelity, and because they have 
been firm and true and steadfast in the 
midst of persecutions and in the midst 
of hatred that has been made manifest 
against them by the world. 

God bless you, and bless our chil- 
dren, and all Israel, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Lift up 
the voice in singing."

Elder Rulon S. Wells. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly, my brethren and sisters, in the meetings of this conference, and in the testimonies that have been borne as to the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. I might say that I have teen specially pleased with the reports that have come from the mission fields. It has brought to us the missionary spirit that we all admire so much in our young men when they return to our midst. I also rejoice in the Gospel itself, the principles which have been revealed by our Father in heaven for the salvation of His children; and I feel a deep interest in spreading abroad among the nations of the earth a knowledge of the Gospel that our Father has restored to the earth in the day and age in which we live. 

In the remarks of Brother Asahel Woodruff, in the tabernacle, this morning, he stated that the people, or a great many of them, had ceased to regard the Bible as any particular authority, and in presenting the Gospel it was necessary to show them its philosophy. They are no longer content to accept of a faith because it harmonizes with the revealed word of God, it must  presented to them in a form that will appeal to their reason. In other words, they must have religion presented to them scientifically before they will accept it. 

My brethren and sisters, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is a scientific religion; it is based upon eternal principles of truth, and truth is science. I thought while he was speaking this morning, how natural it is that men and women should be saved through the operations of that only true Gospel, which our Father has revealed; and how natural are the principles that have been revealed to us, and how they appeal to the reason of intelligent men and women. There are many scientific truths stated in the Bible, but none of them any more scientific than this, that "This is Eternal Life to know Thee, the true and living God and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." It requires only a little reflection to come to the conclusion that it is so in very deed. Every man and woman must recognize the fact that we are surrounded by influences that are abroad in the world. There is one power and influence that is endeavoring to elevate and exalt mankind; it is the Spirit of God that issues forth from His presence, and is bestowed upon all those who diligently seek Him. If we lend a willing ear to the whisperings of the still small voice it will lead us to works of righteousness. 

There is also another influence that is abroad in the land, and everywhere felt among the children of men, that is leading downward, and if we harken to that voice it will lead us to destruction. Have you never felt the power of these influences working upon you? Does it need to be proven to you as individuals that these influences are abroad in the world? Have they not come under your own observation? Every man and woman should say, Yes, I have felt them for myself. On the one hand we listen to the Spirit of God; we hearken to His voice, and it leads us to the doing of those things tJz&t are in harmony with the will of the Father; it causes our hearts to be filled with joy, it teaches us to love our neighbor, to be honest, to be truthful, tao live a godly life and to keep ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world. On the other hand, if we listen to the evil power (which is just as much a reality as the existence of that good power and influence), if we hearken to that, it will lead us to the doing of those things that are evil, it will teach us to cheat our neighbor, to lie and steal, and will lead us down into' the depths of misery; it will lead us into a life of debauchery crime and sin. The reason we find men both good and bad is because these influences are abroad in the world. 

There is another scientific statement recorded in the Scripture, which says: "There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding." The spirit that belongs to us, that gives animation to our bodies, is subject to these influences, and the Spirit of God will give unto us understanding; it will give unto us knowledge; it will bring us unto God. It is also true that the evil spirit will darken our minds, and rob us of the understanding we ought to have. These are realities, my brethren and sisters. We are in the midst of them, for these powers and these influences are operating upon the minds of the children of men. Blessed is he whose soul yearns to be guided and directed by the Spirit of God. Happy is he if he lends a willing ear to the good influence that is trying to purify and save his soul. But unfortunate and unhappy is he who yields to the power and influence of the adversary. 

When Paul was preaching this Gospel of the kingdom in Athens, he found the people in ignorance. They had been worshiping false gods. They had been offering their devotions to Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, and to Neptune, the god of the sea, to Mars, the god of war, and many other false deities whom they were worshiping. But among that people were some who began to yearn after the true and living God. They knew that there was an power. Their own observation had convinced them of that, so they undertook to erect an altar in His honor, and upon that altar they inscribed the words, "To the unknown God." Paul took that inscription for his theme and text, and he said, "Him whom ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you." Later on he admonished them that they should "Seek the Lord if haply they mierht feel after Him and find him, though he be not far distant from every one of us, for in him we live and move and have our being." He proclaimed the existence of the Spirit of God that issued forth from the presence of the Father, and is everywhere to be found. I know that the passage I quoted in the first place is pretty thoroughly understood by the Latterday Saints, that this is eternal life, this is salvation, that we may learn to know the Lord. Then it ought to be in a plan of salvation that is scientific in its nature, that men and women may be brought to the knowledge of God, because that is eternal life. The way to obtain that knowledge, then, is to get the Spirit of God, because no man knoweth the things of God but by the Spirit of God that is in him. Any plan which has for its purpose the bringing of men and women to that knowledge must indeed be founded upon scientific principles. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is peculiarly adapted to the acquisition of that knowledge. Its foundation is laid upon a knowledge of that theme, upon an understanding of that principle. When you see a man or a woman hearken to the still small voice, endeavoring io do right and to learn and lean upon the influence that is uplifting, and which is everywhere inducing men and women to be better, their hearts go out to that power and influence. And what is ii? It is faith in God, the true and living God. Our hearts go out to Him. It is a natural principle that causes us to lean to the good influence, to lend a willing ear and to seek after Him, whom to know is life eternal. Not satisfied with the false gods that are in this world, our hearts yearned for the true and living God. That is faith; a natural principle. 

In order that we may come to a knowledge of God, that the Lord may be pleased to draw nigh unto us, and that we may be qualified to receive an additional outpouring of that Holy Spirit, what are we to do? We must set ourselves in order, forsake our evil ways, and put ourselves in harmony with the Good Spirit that is leading us upward. That is repentance, another natural law, without which we cannot come to a full knoÂ»wledge of God. 

What else do we yearn for? Forgiveness of sin, that we might stand clean before the throne of God, and be qualified to receive additional light which comes from the Spirit of God. Baptism is natural, too. I thank God that He established this ordinance, and put this law in His Church, that we may be washed free from sin, and be prepared to receive His Holy Spirit. 

What else is there in this Gospel that is natural and scientific? Why, the obtaining of this Spirit; and God has instituted an ordinance that it might be conferred upon us by His divine authority, the ordinance of laying on of hands, that we might receive the Spirit of God. These are some of the principles that constitute truly scientific religion. 

Some say, "I am not going to exercise faith; I want to have things proven to me first." You have got to manifest faith in God, or you will give evidence of being on the side of Satan, just as sure as you live. You have got to lend your ear to the Spirit of God, or you will hearken to the spirit of the adversary, who is trying to drag you down. These are the influences that are abroad in the world. They are realities, and you know it, every one of you. You cannot ignore the power of God. The Spirit of God is striving among the children of men, to lift them up and bless those that will hearken. And the spirit of evil is trying to drag you down, striving with you and seeking your destruction, just as sure as you are living here today. Satan has a very evil power, a very evil influence, a very evil name, and his name Is adapted to his character. Did you ever  to analyze it? Let me just point out a few things to you about this evil spirit that is abroad in the world, that I may emphasise the character of the being who is trying to destroy youi souls. We call him the devil. Just imagine his name as being written upon the wall here. It is bad in all its parts: Strike off the d, and it is evil, and that is bad; strike off the e and it is vile; strjke of the v and it is il (ill), and that is bad, too; then strike off the i, and give it a little English accent, and it is hell! And that is just where he will take you, if you listen to his voice. Let us then seek the Spirit of God, and believe In this natural religion which God has* revealed for the savation of the children of men. Amen.

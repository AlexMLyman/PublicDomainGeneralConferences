President John R. Winder. 

It will be remembered that at our last conference a resolution was passed providing for a memorial to the martyred Prophet and Patriarch. The plans have been prepared and are now in the  of the trustee-in-trust, and the work will soon be commenced. We expect to have it completed and ready for dedication on the anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Dec. 23, 1905. 

The choir sang the anthem "Hosannah!" 

Benediction was pronounced by John Smith, presiding Patriarch of the Church. 

The conference adjourned for six months. 
Amen.

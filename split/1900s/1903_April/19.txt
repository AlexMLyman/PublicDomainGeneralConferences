President Joseph F. Smith, 

General Superintendent of Sunday Schools of the Church, said: 

I desire to say just a few words. The benefit of our Sunday school work to our children and the rising generation cannot, I think, be too highly regarded by the Latter-day Saints, and more especially by those who are rearing children, and who desire to have their children brought up and to grow up in the way they should go. 

One of our brethren, reporting his labors as stake superintendent of Sunday schools, made a remark something like this, that they had everything in 
Amen.

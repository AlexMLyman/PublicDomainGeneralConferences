Elder James H. Taggart, 

Superintendent of Sunday schools of the Morgan Stake, said: 

My brethren and sisters, in reporting the Morgan Stake, I can say that we are and have been patterning after the Weber and other stakes. Besides the instructions we have received from the General Superintendemcy, we have received instructions from Superintendent Evans and his assistants. We have also had some members of our board visit Cache, Millard, Boxelder, Weber, Davis and Summit Stakes; and have been benefitted by the good points which we have found therein. Our Sunday schools in the Morgan Stake are a grand success, and though we are a small stake, we) feel that we shall be able to make a good mark. We are proud to say that we are all united as a band of brethren and sisters. Our worst difficulty is the trouble we have in getting the young metn in our Sunday school. We are all laboring to that end, and are succeeding very well. Our local board meetings are a success, but I am sorry to say that in some wards we have not as yet been successful in getting them started, but where they have been started they are working satisfactorily. I pray the Lord to bless us all and our labors in the Morgan Stake, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

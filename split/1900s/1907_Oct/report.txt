Our King, our Deliv'rer, our all.

by . Elder Wm. T. Jack. 

The choir sang the hymn begin-

Softly beams the sacred dawning 
Of the great Millennial morn, 

And to Saints gives welcome warning 
That the day is hasting on. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

Gratifying unity of the Priesthood and

dividual effort and righteousness es- 
sential to salvation. — Assurance of 
eternal felicity imparted by the Gos- 
pel. — Admonition to faithfulness and

purity of life. — Shun association with 
w icked enemies, but seek their salva- 
tion. — The dead, as well as the living, 
must repent. 

I feel very thankful to see so 
many of the Latter-day Saints as- 
sembled as are here this morning 
at the opening - session of our Seven- 
ty-eighth Semi-Annual Conference. 
I desire to express the feelings of 
welcome we have to all of you who 
have come together for the purpose 
of participating in the business that 
may be transacted at this confer- 
ence, and for the purpose of listen- 
ing to such instructions as may be 
given to us through the servants of 
the Lord. It is a source of great 
satisfaction to me to witness the in- 
terest that is manifested in this con- 
ference by our people. We welcome 
you here this morning, and feel to 
invoke upon you the blessing of the 
Lord; that His Holy Spirit may 
rest upon all who are assembled 
here for the purpose of worshiping 
the Lord in spirit and in truth, and 
who have come with a desire and 
purpose in their hearts to fulfill 
their duty to the Church and to the 
Lord, who has made it, by His 
word, necessary for us to assemble 
together, from time to time, to talk 
over and to consider His work, 
and the business that pertains to 
the upbuilding of Zion and the 
spread of the Gospel to the nations 
of the world. 

I feel thankful that the Presi- 
dency are in the enjoyment of usu- 
al health and strength, and that we 
are united in our labors. I am also 
very thankful to say to you that the 
Apostles are also united, not only 
among themselves, but with the 
Presidency; and our interest in the 
work of the Lord is increasing, I 
believe, day by day. I may say 
with all truth, that the First Coun- 



cil of Seventies are united with us 
and also united with each other; 
and, so far as I know, (and I think 
that we have very good opportu- 
nity to judge), there is a spirit of 
union and love existing throughout 
all the Church, pervading all the 
people of God. And this is un- 
doubtedly a source of pleasure and 
of strength, a source of joy and 
satisfaction to every soul who has 
an interest in the work of the Lord. 

Our duties in the Church should 
be, I think, paramount to every 
other interest in the world. It is 
true that we are under the neces- 
sity of looking after our worldly 
interests. It is, of course, neces- 
sary for us to labor with our hands, 
and our minds, in our various oc- 
cupations for obtaining the neces- 
saries of life. It is essential that the 
Latter-day Saints should be indus- 
trious and persevering in all the la- 
bors that devolve upon them, for it 
is written that "the inhabitants of 
Zion shall remember their labors, 
inasmuch as they are appointed to 
labor, in all faithfulness; for the 
idler shall be had in remembrance 
before the Lord." Again it is writ- 
ten : "Let every man be diligent in 
all things, and the idler shall not 
have place in the Church except he 
repents and mends his ways." 
Again : "Thou shalt not be idle ; for 
he that is idle shall not eat the 
bread nor wear the garments of the 
laborer." But in all our labors in 
life, in all the cares that beset us,, 
and the temporal responsibilities 
that rest upon us, we should put 
uppermost in our thoughts, and 
highest in our appreciation and love 
the Cause of Zion, which is in- 
deed the Cause of truth and right- 
eousness. It is the plan of life that 
the Almighty has restored to man 
in the latter days for the salvation

of the souls of men, not only in the 
world to come, but in our present 
life, for the Lord has instituted His 
work that His people may enjoy the 
blessing's of this life to the utmost; 
that they should be saved in this 
present life as well as in the life to 
come, that they should lay the 
foundation here for immunity from 
sin and all its effects, and conse- 
quences, that they may obtain an 
inheritance in the kingdom of God 
beyond this vale of tears. The Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ is the power of 
God unto salvation, and it is abso- 
lutely necessary for every man and 
woman in the Church of Christ to 
work righteousness, to observe the 
laws of God, and keep the com- 
mandments that He has given, in 
order that they may avail them- 
selves of the power of God unto 
salvation in this life. 

I do not believe in the ideas that 
we hear sometimes advanced in the 
world, that it matters but little 
what men do in this time, if they 
will but confess Christ at the end 
of their journey in life, that that is 
all-sufficient, and that by so doing 
they will receive their passport into 
heaven. I denounce this doctrine. 
It is unscriptural, it is unreason- 
able, it is untrue, and it will not 
avail any man, no matter by whom 
this idea may be advocated; it will 
prove an utter failure unto men. As 
reasonable beings, as men and 
women of intelligence, we cannot 
help but admire and honor the doc- 
trine of Jesus Christ, which is the 
doctrine of God, and which re- 
quires of every man and woman 
righteousness in their lives, purity 
in their thoughts, uprightness in 
their daily walk and conversation, 
devotion to the Lord, love of truth, 
love of their fellow-man, and above 
all things in the world the love of 



God. These were the precepts that 
were inculcated by the Son of God 
when He walked among His breth- 
ren in the meridian of time. He 
taught these precepts ; He exempli- 
fied them in His life, and advo- 
cated continually the doing of the 
will of Him that sent Him. 

He that sent His only-begotten 
Son into the world to accomplish 
the mission which He did, also sent 
every soul within the sound of my 
voice, and indeed every man and 
woman in the world to accomplish 
a mission, and that mission cannot 
be accomplished by neglect; nor by 
indifference ; nor can it be accom- 
plished in ignorance. We must 
learn our duty; learn the require- 
ments that the Lord has made at 
our hands, and understand the re- 
sponsibilities that He has placed 
upon us. We should learn the ob- 
ligation that we are under to God, 
and to each other, and that we are 
under also to the cause of Zion, that 
has been restored to the earth in 
the latter days. These things arc 
essential, and we cannot prosper 
in spiritual things, we cannot grow 
in knowledge and understanding ; 
our minds cannot expand in the. 
knowledge of God, nor in wisdom, 
nor in the gifts of the Holy Spirit, 
without we devote our thoughts and 
our efforts toward our own better- 
ment, toward the increase of our 
own wisdom, and knowledge in the 
things of God. 

We labor day by day for the 
bread that perishes, and we devote 
but a few hours, comparatively, in 
seeking to obtain the bread of life. 
Our thoughts, in great measure, are 
placed upon worldly things, the 
things that perish, and therefore we 
are prone to neglect the higher du- 
ties that devolve upon us as the 
children of our father, and to for-

get, in some measure, the greater 
obligations that rest upon us. It is 
therefore proper, and indeed it be- 
comes the duty of those who are 
placed upon the towers as watch- 
men in Zion to exhort the people 
to diligence, to prayerfulness, to 
humility, to a love of the truth that 
has been revealed to them, and to 
earnest devotion to the work of the 
Lord, which is intended for their 
individual salvation, and, so far as 
they have influence upon others, 
the salvation of those whom they 
may have power to influence to 
move in the right direction ; not that 
I can save any man, nor that any 
one man can save any other man or 
fit him for exaltation in the king- 
dom of God. This is not given to 
me to do for others, nor is it given 
to any man to be a Savior in this 
sense, or in this way, to his fellow 
man ; but man can set an example ; 
man can urge the precepts of the 
Gospel. Man can proclaim the 
truth to others, and can point out 
the way to them in which to walk, 
and if they will harken to their 
counsel, listen to their admonitions 
and be led by them, they themselves 
will seek the path of life and they 
will walk in it, and obtain their ex- 
altation for themselves. And thus 
the work required of us by the Lord 
is an individual work, it devolves 
upon each individual alike. No 
man can be saved in the kingdom 
of God in sin. No man will ever 
be forgiven of his sins by the just 
Judge, except he repents of his 
sins. No man will ever be freed 
from the power of death unless he 
is born again, as the Lord Almighty 
has decreed, and declared to the 
world by the mouth of His Son in 
the meridian of time, and as He 
has declared it again in this dispen- 
sation through the Prophet Joseph 



Smith. Men can only be saved and 
exalted in the kingdom of God in 
righteousness, therefore we must 
repent of our sins, and walk in the 
light as Christ is in the light, that 
His blood may cleanse us from all 
sins, and that we may have fellow- 
ship with God and receive of His 
glory and exaltation. 

Now, it is not my purpose to oc- 
cupy very much time this morning, 
but I desire, the Lord giving me 
His spirit, to declare my faith in the 
divine mission of the Son of God, 
who spoke as no man ever spoke; 
who announced principles and doc- 
trine that no man ever enunciated, 
and who proclaimed in the clearest 
possible terms, the plan of life and 
salvation ; and gave His own life 
and name to the world, as the only 
means and name under heaven by 
which man can be saved and exalt- 
ed in the kingdom of God. 

I declare to you in all candor, and 
in all earnestness of soul, that I be- 
lieve with all my heart in the di- 
vine mission of Joseph Smith the 
Prophet, that I am convinced in ev- 
ery fiber of my being that God 
raised him up to restore to the earth 
the Gospel of Christ, which is in- 
deed the power of God unto sal- 
vation. I testify to you that Joseph 
Smith was instrumental in the 
hand of the Lord in restoring God's 
truth to the world, and also the 
holy Priesthood, which is His au- 
thority delegated unto man. I know 
this is true, and I testify of it to 
you. To me it is all-in-all ; it is my 
life, it is my light ; it is my hope, 
and my joy; it gives me the only 
assurance that I have for exalta- 
tion, for my resurrection from 
death, with those whom I have 
loved and cherished in this life, and 
with those with whom my lot has 
been cast in this world — honorable

men. pure, humble men, who were 
obedient unto God and His com- 
mands, who were not ashamed of 
the Gospel of Christ, nor of their 
convictions or knowledge of the 
truth of the Gospel; men who' were 
made of the stuff of which martyrs 
are made, and who were willing at 
any moment to lay down their lives 
for Christ's sake, and for the Gos- 
pel, if need be, which they had re- 
ceived with the testimony of the 
Holy Spirit in their hearts. I want 
to be re-united with these men 
when I shall have finished my 
course here. When my mission is 
done here I hope to go beyond into 
the spirit world where they dwell, 
and be re-united with them. It is 
this Gospel of the Son of God that 
gives me the hope that I have of 
this consummation, and of the re- 
alization of my desire in this direc- 
tion. I have staked all on this Gos- 
pel, and I have not done it in vain.- 
I know in whom I trust. I know 
that my Redeemer lives, and that 
He shall stand upon the earth in 
the latter day, and, as Job, has ex- 
pressed it, "Though worms shall 
destroy this body, yet in my flesh 
shall I see God." 

It is these things that I desire to 
impress upon the minds of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. You have received 
the truth. No man can prove to the 
contrary. No man under the heav- 
ens knows to the contrary. But you 
do know that you have received the 
truth, for God has given to you His 
Spirit, the Holy Ghost, by whom 
the things of the Father are re- 
vealed unto the understanding of 
the children of light, and they know 
in whom they trust. You have re- 
ceived the Gospel of Christ. Live 
it. Be faithful to it. Honor the 
covenants that you have made with 
the Lord in the waters of baptism. 



Honor every obligation that you 
owe to God and to your fellow 
man. Live so that you can be in- 
deed saviors upon Mount Zion in 
the sense that your lives will be 
above reproach, in the sense that 
no man can justly point to you as 
transgressors of the law of God, 
though they may malign you ; 
though they may say all manner of 
evil against you falsely. Live so 
that they cannot justly and truly 
point out in you corruption, wick- 
edness, or misconduct. Let your 
light so shine that honest men will 
see your good works and will be 
led to glorify your Father who is 
in heaven. Keep away from the 
haunts of sin. While you may en- 
tertain in your hearts a feeling of 
love, of charity; a merciful feeling 
toward sinners, those that trans- 
gress the laws of God you do not 
have to take them into your bos- 
oms, nor condescend to their con- 
duct and habits. 

I feel in my heart to forgive all 
men in the broad sense that God 
requires of me to forgive all men, 
and I desire to love my neighbor as 
myself; and to this extent I bear 
no malice toward any of the chil- 
dren of my Father. But there are 
enemies to the work of the Lord, 
as there were enemies to the Son of 
God. There are those who speak 
only evil of the ' Latter-day Saints. 
There are those — and they abound 
largely in our midst, who will shut 
their eyes to every virtue and to 
every good thing connected with 
this latter-day work, and will pour 
out floods of falsehood and mis- 
representation against the people of 
God. I forgive them for this. I 
leave them in the hand of the just 
Judge. Let Him deal with them as 
seemeth Him good, but they are not 
and cannot become my bosom com-

panions. I cannot condescend to 
that. While I would not harm a 
hair of their head, while I would 
not throw a straw in their path, to 
hinder them from turning from the 
error of their way to the light of 
truth ; I would as soon think of tak- 
ing a centipede or a scorpion or 
any poisonous reptile and putting 
it into my bosom, as I would think 
. of becoming a companion or an 
associate of such a man. 

These are my sentiments, and I 
believe that they are correct. If 
you can throw yourself in the way 
of the sinner to stop him in his 
downward course, and become an 
instrument in the hand of the Lord 
of turning him from the way of 
vice, iniquity, or crime, into the way 
of righteousness and uprightness, 
you are justified and that is de- 
manded of you. You should do 
this. If you can save a sinner from 
his wickedness, turn the wicked 
from the course of death that he 
is pursuing, to the way of life and 
salvation, you will save a soul from 
death, and you will have been an 
instrument in the hand of the Lord 
of turning the sinner unto right- 
eousness, for which you will re- 
ceive your reward. Some of our 
good Latter-day Saints have be- 
come so exceedingly good( ?) that 
they cannot tell the difference be- 
tween a Saint of God, an honest 
man, and a son of Beelzebub, who 
has yielded himself absolutely to 
sin and wickedness. And they call 
that liberality, broadness of mind, 
exceeding love. I do not want to 
become so blinded with love for 
my enemies that I cannot discern 
between light and darkness, be- 
tween truth and error, between 
good and evil ; but I hope to live so 
that I shall have sufficient light in 
me to discern between error and 



truth, and to cast my lot on the side 
of truth and not on the side of error 
and darkness. The Lord bless the 
Latter-day Saints. If I am too nar- 
row with reference to these mat- 
ters I hope that the wisdom of my 
brethren and the Spirit of Light 
from the Lord may broaden my 
soul. 

We have a few people amongst 
us who are so wrapped up in and so 
devoted to some of their kindred 
who have been guilty of every spe- 
cies of abomination and wicked- 
ness in the world, that, the mo- 
ment they are dead they will come 
and ask for permission to go into 
the ^ house of God to perform the 
ordinances of the Gospel for their 
redemption. I do not blame them 
for their affection for their dead, 
nor do I blame them for the de- 
sire in their heart to do something 
for their salvation, but I do not ad- 
mire their wisdom, nor can I agree 
with their conception of right and 
justice. You cannot take a mur- 
derer, a suicide, an adulterer, a liar, 
or one who was or is thoroughly 
abominable in his life here, and 
simply by the performance of an or- 
dinance of the Gospel, cleanse him 
from sin and usher him into the 
presence of God. God has not in- 
stituted a plan of that kind, and it 
cannot be done. He has said you 
shall repent of your sins. The 
wicked will have to repent of 
their wickedness. Those who die 
without the knowledge of the 
Gospel will have to come to 
the knowledge of it, and those 
who sin against light will have 
to pay the uttermost farthing 
for their transgression and their 
departure from the Gospel, before 
they can ever get back to it. Do not 
forget that. Do not forget it, von 
Elders in Israel, nor you, mother'-

in Israel, either, and, when you 
seek to save either the living or the 
dead, bear it in mind that you can 
only do it on the principle of their 
repentance, and acceptation of the 
plan of life. That is the only- way 
in which you can succeed. 

The Lord bless you. Peace be 
unto the House of Israel. Never 
mind what the world says, nor what 
the world does against you. Let 
us serve God, do our duty, live our 
religion, keep the commandments 
of the Lord, and work out our sal- 
vation in time and throughout eter- 
nity. This is my admonition to the 
Latter-day Saints, and I pray God 
that we may all be able to do it, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the -anthem, 
"Lift up the voice in singing." 

PEESIDENT JOHN" R. WINDEE. 

Unity of the First Presidency and Apos- 
tles. — Progress of the Lord's work in 
the world, and in His temples. — Dis- 
cretion to be observed in work for the 
Dead. — Gratitude for lengthy life and 
God's favor. 

You cannot imagine, my brethren 
and sisters, how grateful I feel this 
morning to have one more privilege 
of meeting with you in general con- 
ference. I was very much delight- 
ed in listening to the remarks we 
have heard from our President, and 
I wish to testify, before you, to the 
truth of the same. President Smith 
has spoken of the unity of the First 
Presidency and the Apostles ; I tes- 
tify to that also. We are united, 
and work together harmoniously in 
all matters pertaining to the inter- 
est and welfare of the Church of 
Christ on the earth. 

I appreciate the privilege of 



standing before you a few moments, 
and express my thanks and grati- 
tude to God my eternal Father that 
He has lengthened out my days, 
that I am permitted to see this beau- 
tiful morning, and address this 
grand assemblage of Latter-day 
Saints. 

My desire and intention is to sus- 
tain and uphold my President in all 
matters pertaining to the welfare of 
the Church upon the earth. 

I feel very thankful, my brethren 
and sisters, for the gratifying re- 
ports that come to us concerning 
the progress of the work of the 
Lord throughout the world, where 
our missionaries are laboring. While 
the work is prospering in the world, 
I am very thankful to be able to 
say that the work of the Lord is 
also increasing and multiplying in 
His holy temples. This is a duty 
that is laid upon the Saints; the 
Lord requires that they shall min- 
ister in behalf of the dead, and it 
is astonishing sometimes to see the 
interest that is taken in regard to 
this matter. Our temples are fre- 
quently filled to overflowing, and 
this is a source of great pleasure to 
us. 

President Smith made a remark 
in relation to those who seek per- 
mission to do work for the dead 
who were unworthy. Such cases 
have arisen, and I have marveled 
that brethren and sisters do not ex- 
hibit better judgment — if I may be 
allowed to use that expression — 
than to seek the privileges of the 
house of the Lord for those who 
are not worthy. I have no doubt 
they feel anxious and desirous to do 
all they can for the salvation of 
their relatives ; but they should ex- 
ercise wisdom in regard to these 
matters. 

I hope, my brethre:. and sisters.

that we will all be united — that the 
Latter-day Saints throughout the 
world will all be as united as the 
authorities of the Church are at the 
present day, and that the Lord's 
work will continue to grow, and 
prosper, and multiply upon the 
earth. 

I feel to again express my grati- 
tude to God, my eternal Father, for 
His goodness and mercies to me. 
He has lengthened out my days till 
I am now nearly eighty-six years 
of age, and I am thankful for the 
measure of health and strength I 
enjoy. My determination is, this 
morning, that I will stand by and 
uphold President Joseph F. Smith 
with all my might, mind, and 
strength ; that I shall keep the com- 
mandments of God, and that I and 
my house shall serve the Lord from 
this time henceforth and forever. 
This is my desire and prayer in the 
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LTJND. 

An example of punctuality. — Encourag- 
ing reports from missions. — A mis- 
sionary's unselfish devotion to duty. — 
Erection of meeting houses, and at- 
tendance therein. — Faithfulness and 
zeal under ordinary conditions. — Need 
of watch-care over children. — Advan- 
tages of religious training, and proper 
example. — Immigrants should be help- 
ed. 

I hope that all present will re- 
member the good remarks made by 
President Smith this morning, and 
follow his exhortation to us as Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I rejoice in the tes- 
timony he bore, and I thought how 
thankful we ought to be that the 
Lord has given us individually a 
testimony of the truth, that Jesus is 
the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a 
Prophet of God. I was also pleased 



to hear President Winder express 
his gratitude at being in our midst. 
A short time ago he was taken sick 
with pneumonia, and, on account of 
his age, we all felt apprehensive that 
he might not have strength to over- 
come it, but the Lord blessed him. 
He was absent from the temple only 
one day. Here is a lesson in punc- 
tuality for us to follow; President 
Winder has never been absent from 
the temple, from the time it was 
opened till now, with the exception 
of that one day. We feel thankful 
that the Lord has strengthened him, 
and given him so great a degree of 
health that he has been able to con- 
tinue his labors, both in the temple 
and in the office with his brethren. 

I am pleased to see this large con- 
gregation this morning, at the open- 
ing of our conference. It shows 
that the people are interested in the 
work of the Lord, that thev love to 
come together on these occasions to 
receive strength in their faith, and 
to be instructed in their duties. 
President Smith said that the work 
is progressing ; this is true. The re- 
ports from all our missions are en- 
couraging. The Elders are doing 
their best to disseminate the truth 
among the people where they are 
called to labor, they are trying to 
make the most of their time, and 
their labors are crowned with great- 
er additions to the Church. The 
Presidents of Missions are studying 
how the work can be best forward- 
ed in their respective mission fields, 
and the Elders are sustaining them. 
We hear good reports, monthly, of 
the labors of the Elders ; and we are 
pleased that but very few Elders re- 
turn before they have honorably 
filled their missions. Sometimes 
sickness may compel them to leave 
their fields of labor, and in that case 
we consider they have performed an 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND.

honorable mission as long as they 
have been away. We do not want 
the Elders to feel that they must 
stay in the mission field two years, 
or any stated length of time, if their 
health is impaired. We want the 
Presidents of Missions to watch 
over the Elders in their charge, and 
if any of the brethren are attacked 
with sickness to see that the best 
care is taken of them; and, if it is 
deemed wise, to send them home, 
that they be not kept in the mission 
and thus endanger their lives. As a 
general thing, the Elders are deter- 
mined not to leave their missions 
until they have been honorably re- 
leased, and many of them feel, when 
the time approaches for them to go 
home, that they can hardly leave the 
Saints in the world. They have 
such affection and love for the 
Saints among whom they labor, and 
for their fellow missionaries, that it 
seems almost as hard to leave their 
fields of labor to go home as it did 
to leave their dear ones at home to 
go upon their missions. 

We have a letter from President 
Taylor of the Japan Mission, a 
young man who has labored there 
over six years, among a people who 
do not believe in Christ or in the 
Gospel as preached by His Apostles. 
To convert such a people as the Jap- 
anese is, of course, a hard task. This 
young man and the missionaries 
with him are doing all in their pow- 
er to reach the hearts of that peo- 
ple, and to convert them to a belief 
in Christ and in the saving princi- 
ples of the Gospel. Brother Taylor 
is translating the Book of Mormon 
into Japanese, and he is anxious 
that it shall appear in the best form, 
that the language shall be such that 
the people there cannot find fault 
with its construction. When you 
consider the difference between a 



language like that and our own, and 
the difference between their mode 
of thinking and expressing them- 
selves and our mode of thought and 
expression, you can imagine how 
hard such a labor is. But this 
young man says in his letter that he 
does not desire to return until he ' 
has finished the work. So devoted 
does he feel to the. labor of the 
Lord that, though he has been ab- 
sent so long, and has a splendid 
home here, where friends would do 
everything for him, yet he is will- 
ing to spend his time and his means 
in the work of the Lord in that far- 
off land, even if it should require 
years longer to accomplish the. task, 
set him. That is the spirit that 
should inspire our Elders. They 
should seek the kingdom of God 
and His work first, and then let 
other things follow. 

The past summer has witnessed 
the erection of many meeting 
houses. Our brethren feel anxious 
to improve their houses of worship, 
that they may have proper places in 
which to worship the Lord. We ■ 
commend the Saints for their will- 
ingness to do this, but we would say 
to the presiding men, be careful not 
to incur too great expense in erect- 
ing meeting houses. While we love 
to see these buildings monuments of 
honor to the people, yet we do not 
want the people to be over-bur- 
dened. 

We hope that the people who are 
so willing to build meeting houses 
will also be willing to use them, and 
not let indifference and carelessness 
keep them at home on the Sabbath 
day. This is one of the duties that , 
we must perform ; unless the Saints 
attend their meetings it will be hard 
for them to keep alive in the Gos- 
pel. "To live our religion is just as 
hard as to die for it," has been said, 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and I believe it. When our time and 
attention are taken up with the ev- 
ery-day affairs and labors of life, 
we are apt to get a little indifferent 
to the work of the Lord. While on 
the battle field, a soldier will rush 
to his death under the impulses of 
the moment. Likewise, when one 
is attacked for his religion, he feels 
strong- to resist the attack, and 
stands up for his belief at any cost, 
but when it comes to every-day du- 
ties, — and there is something for 
the Latter-day Saint to do every 
day — some become lukewarm and 
indifferent. It requires much zeal 
and endurance to attend to our du- 
ties in the Church under these or- 
dinary conditions. The feeling 
should be uppermost in our hearts 
that, under all circumstances, we 
will faithfully do our duty. It is 
not he that just begins and then 
stops who is promised salvation, 
but he who endures to the end. Let 
us not forget to ask ourselves every 
morning, What are the duties be- 
fore me today? and, when night 
comes, let the question be, Have I 
performed my duties today? If we 
can answer this affirmatively, then 
with our last waking thoughts our 
hearts can turn to our heavenly 
Father with thanks for His aid and 
assistance during the day, and in 
prayer for His protection during 
the night. We have duties that we 
owe to ourselves, to our fellow men, 
and to God; let us not neglect any 
of them. There are also duties that 
we owe to our children; we must 
not neglect them, they are of the 
utmost importance. 

This summer we have had some 
*sad exposures of acts of depravity 
that have taken place here in Salt 
Lake City, amongst some of the ju- 
veniles. We were shocked to hear 
of these misdoings. Every think- 



ing man and woman should study 
the matter earnestly and try to find 
the causes of, and the remedies for, 
such a state of affairs. One of the 
causes of the condition that we read 
about is the freedom we give our 
children — unrestricted liberty to 
roam in the streets, especially at 
night time. Our children ought to 
be home in the evenings. If we al- 
low them to go to a neighbor's, or 
any other place, we should know 
where they are, and not feel satis- 
fied to have them come in at any 
time during the night. It takes 
work to watch over our children, 
but it is something that will reward 
us, and the children will thank us, 
by and by, for our watchcare over 
them. I remember a boy who com- 
plainingly said to his mother, "Why 
are you always on my track ? Why 
can't I go like our neighbor's chil- 
dren? Their mother never looks 
after them ; they have perfect free- 
dom ; but I can't be away ten min- 
utes before you are looking for me." 
This boy thanks his mother now 
for the care she had over him. The 
boys I have alluded to have taken a 
course that must make their moth- 
ers very sad indeed. We must look 
after our children at nights. Where 
there are curfew laws, they should 
be enforced. Make the children un- 
derstand that when the curfew bel! 
rings they must be at home. 

We ought to point out to the chil- 
dren the dangers that beset their 
path; and, as President Smith has 
told us, warn them against bad 
company. How dangerous bad com- 
panions are. A vicious boy or a 
vicious girl can do incalculable 
harm in a community. We should 
warn our children against such as- 
sociations, and urge them to seek 
good company — the company of 
those good companions with whom 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



11 



they study in school. Let them 
study their lessons together, and 
spend their time usefully. Let us 
warn them against bad company in 
the streets and other places. Of 
course we all feel that this ought to 
be done, but many of us either have 
so much confidence in our children 
that we think they Will not do 
wrong, or we are careless about it, 
but such carelessness will result in 
much sorrow and regret. As our 
children grow up, let us have them 
attend the Sunday Schools, the 
Primaries, and Religion Classes, 
and, when they are older, the Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations. All 
these organizations are safe-guards 
to put around our children. 

A word about the Religion 
Classes. Our outlines for the com- 
ing winter present lessons on moral- 
ity and purity of life, giving the 
children practical lessons in true 
living — in fact, teaching them prac- 
tical religion ; teaching them to 
pray, to be devoted to godliness and 
piety — I mean piety of the right 
kind — and teaching them to walk 
uprightly before the Lord. We 
have tried to make the outlines for 
the coming year conform as nearly 
as possible to these lines. Brother 
Maeser, who took such an interest 
in Religion Classes, was very de- 
sirous that teachers should take a 
special interest in the children, not 
alone in the schools or in the classes 
but when they were out of school. 
The Religion Classes being a part 
of the Church School system, he 
felt that the same guardianship 
should be exercised over the chil- 
dren belonging to these classes as 
is exercised over the children who 
attend the Church schools. You 
know the organizations we have 
there — how the teachers are trying 
to look after the children who are 



sent from distant homes to the 
Church schools, to see that their 
time is spent usefully, and that they 
are not getting into bad company, 
and bad practices and habits. In 
some of our stakes, the suggestion 
has been made that our Religion 
Class teachers help to look after the 
young at nights, help the probation- 
ary officers of the Juvenile Court to 
keep the children at home, to know 
something about them, and lovingly 
use an influence for good over these 
children who have been given into 
their charge in the Religion Classes. 
We hope this movement will be suc- 
cessful, and that it will extend 
throughout Zion, for we feel that 
we cannot take too much care of 
our children. They are precious 
charges given unto us, and the 
Lord will ask us to render an ac- 
count, by and by, as to how we have 
taken care of them. I feel deeply 
concerned about our children, and 
I know all the Latter-day Saints 
feel the same. Let us watch over 
our children in their amusements. 
Lately, the old custom of the young 
and the old mingling together in 
amusement has become obsolete, 
and we leave the children alone in 
their dances and sociables. It 
would be well for the Bishops who 
can exercise an influence upon the 
management of amusements in the 
wards to see that older people be 
present with the children, so that 
our children, when they associate 
together, may not come under im- 
proper influences. 

In our homes, brethren and sis- 
ters, let us be careful of our talk 
before the children, and be careful 
to set them such an example as we 
would like them to follow. The 
boys and girls look up to their par- 
ents with full confidence, and what 
they see father and mother do they 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



consider must be all right; and, if 
they are told that certain things 
are not right, they think it cannot 
be very wrong for them to follow 
the examples of their fathers and 
mothers who do these things. 

Let us be careful that our con- 
duct be such that it will not give 
offense to our conscience, and that 
it may be a correct pattern to our 
children and others. A great many 
people live in our midst who do 
not belong to our faith, and they 
watch us. They know well how 
a Latter-day Saint ought to live, 
and, if he deviates from the course 
that they know he ought to follow, 
they are not slow in pointing it out, 
and it gives offense. It has been 
said : "Woe unto them by whom 
offenses come." We do not want 
to take upon us the responsibility of 
giving offense, but we want to use 
our time and efforts to bring others 
into the Gospel fold. If we are 
not called to labor abroad as mis- 
sionaries, or called upon to preach 
at home, we can preach by exam- 
ple. Let the world see us as we are. 
Let them see us not only profess- 
ing to be Saints, but that we are 
Saints in very deed. 

Let us not forget the poor in our 
midst. Let the Saints remember 
their fast offerings that . the poor 
may be provided for, that they shall 
not suffer want and their cry rise 
up to our heavenly Father. He has 
commanded us to minister to them, 
then let us see to it that the poor in 
our midst are remembered. 

When our brethren and sisters 
from abroad come here as immi- 
grants, let us try to look after them 
and help them. The first week or 
two they are here everything is 
strange, they have no work, and 
they feel tried and friendless. That 
is the time to reach their hearts. 



Often we let this opportunity to 
help them go by, and they become 
associated with people who are dis- 
contented, who, perhaps, have apos- 
tatized from the truth, and our im- 
migrant brethren and sisters may be 
influenced by such people. When the 
immigrants come to our different 
wards, let us remember that they 
have obeyed the Gospel out of love, 
for it. They have been willing to 
leave friends and relatives for the 
sake of their faith, and have come 
here as strangers. Let them not 
feel that those whom they have 
looked upon as children of Zion 
have lost the love they should have 
for their brethren. I think this is 
a very important matter for us to 
consider. 

I would also say to our brethren 
•who have been abroad as mission- 
aries, who have labored to bring 
people into the Church do not lose 
your interest in them, or in the 
work for which you have spent so 
much time and means. You should 
remember those with whom you be- 
come acquainted in your missions. 
If a letter might do good, send it 
to them ; and, when they come here, 
remember how hospitable they were 
when you came into their homes; 
remember their kindness to you, 
and try to do something for them 
here. I commend those of our 
brethren who have continued to 
take an interest in the Saints that 
they became acquainted with on 
their missions. I have noticed, 
when the Saints from abroad come 
here, such Elders have been will- 
ing to take them into their homes, 
try to get places for them to work, 
and are interested in their welfare. 
That is right, and is what the mis- 
sionary ought to .do. He should also 
feel that there is never coming a 
time when he is not a missionary. 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



13 



And all of us, my brethren and sis- 
ters, should take an interest in those 
who come here. Remember that we 
send our Elders — our sons and 
brothers — abroad to preach the Gos- 
pel, to bring- the people into the 
Church of Christ, and to gather 
them to Zion ; now, When they get 
here, let us not feel that our duty is 
ended, but remember that the re- 
sponsibility for the growth of Zion 
and the building up of the kingdom 
of God rests upon us. 

May the Lord bless the Latter- 
day Saints ; may his work continue 
to spread with greater speed in the 
earth, that the truth may be known, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

President Smith requested the 
Presidents of Stakes in Salt Lake 
City to adopt measures to provide 
for visitors attending Conference 
who need places where they may 
obtain lodging or board. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn commencing: 

"Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah, 
Lead us to the promised land, 

We are weak, but Thou art able — 
Hold us with Thy powerful hand." 

Conference was adjourned till 2 
p. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch Angus M. Cannon. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn commencing : 



Our God, we raise to thee, 
Thanks for Thy blessings free, 

We here enjoy ; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

We sing for joy. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ed- 
win D. Woolley. . 

,The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word ! 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled? 

PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

Unchangeable and everlasting character 
of the latter-day work. — Church mem- 
bers must be diligent in the Lord's 
service. — Home should be made the 
most desirable resort. — Advantages of 
labor. — The Lord has made this a land 
of liberty. — Sameness of Spirit mani- 
fest in all the Priesthood. 

I feel, as President Winder re- 
marked this morning, very grateful 
that I am privileged to meet with 
you once more. I expect to meet 
with you again many times, and I 
think President Winder will also. 
Bis prospects for living are better 
than they were some years ago. I 
presume we all feel grateful that 
\ac are alive, and that the Lord 
continues to be with His people and 
to sustain them. The measure of 
peace that is now secured to the 
Latter-day Saints is very refresh- 
ing The Lord's kingdom grows 
stronger every day. It is becom- 
ing established ; the people are 
gaining experience, and their faith 
is stronger. We are, today, an 
army of veterans in the service of 
the Lord. In doing our duty faith- 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fully and well, as the older mem- 
bers of the community, we are ex- 
amples to the younger ones who are 
receiving- training and experience, 
and they will be well prepared to 
carry forward the work when we 
get tired and have to lay it down. 
In due time, of course, we will all 
have to lay off the burdens of this 
great, important and marvelous 
work. We live only a little while,— 
just a few years, — and if we are 
wise we will strive to accomplish 
all that the Lord enables us to do; 
for we are laying the foundation of 
the most remarkable work that has 
ever been undertaken on this earth. 
It is the dispensation of the fulness 
of times. The Lord has set His 
hand, for the last time, to accom- 
plish His purposes on the earth, 
and we have the assurance that 
there will be no failure — that this 
work will not be given to another 
people. That is one great comfort 
the Lord has given to us in con- 
' nection with this work : it will not 
be destroyed, nor given to another 
people. It has remained, from its 
inception, among this people, and 
has not changed hands. You men 
have been selected and sustained to 
carry forward this ministry. An 
abundance of material is always at 
hand — timber that is tried and 
proven ; so that today the work of 
the Lord is so firmly fixed in the 
minds of the Latter-day Saints that 
there can not be many surprises 
sprung upon us from within, and 
none from without. Of course, we 
understand that this work is pecu- 
liar, for the reason that it is the 
work of the Lord, established by 
the Father, and has not originated 
with men. It did not come from 
other denominations, but came fresh 
from the Lord. It was established 
in the early part of the last century. 



It is not very old, only 77 years of 
age — just a young Church and a 
young people; but it has made re- 
markable and steady progress. It 
has grown rapidly, and kept the 
ground it has gained, independent 
of those who have passed away, 
those that have lost the faith and 
have tired in this great work. The 
Church is still increasing and 
spreading abroad, and will do so 
until it fills the whole earth. That 
is its mission. We are fortunate to 
have a part in this splendid work, 
and it behooves us, my brethren and 
sisters, not to waste our precious 
time. The few years allotted to us 
are a very brief span of life. We 
have no time to waste ; and, as we 
heard this morning, it is a work 
that brings into employment every 
individual member of the Church. 
We are all expected to be ministers 
of the Gospel, advocating it, ex- 
pounding the Scriptures, and 
preaching the Gospel by our lives 
as well as by our voices. Of course 
troubles arise in our midst; temp- 
tations and evils beset our path, es- 
pecially the path of the youth 
among us ; but we understand that 
it is our business to "work while 
the day lasts, for the night comes 
when no man can work." We are 
not expected to occupy the night in 
work, nor yet in pleasure ; the night 
is for rest and sleep, to be at home 
securely. As a rule, the days are 
long enough, and furnish opportu- 
nity for labor in developing the re- 
sources of the earth, and caring for 
our material affairs — the day for 
labor and the night for rest. 

I endorse the suggestions, made 
to us frequently, that we should 
take care of the young people and 
keep them off the streets ; keep them 
from seeking pleasure in the night 
time, and thus avoid the dangers 



PRESIDENT FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 



15 



and evils that beset the path of 
youth in the night, and the path 
of older people as well. It is bet- 
ter that we should train ourselves 
and families to love our homes ; we 
should make them desirable and 
pleasant, and provide that home 
training - and discipline which is so 
necessary. We should encourage 
reading by establishing home li- 
braries and reading rooms, so that 
our time may be profitably occupied 
at home instead of in pleasure 
abroad. The curfew rings at nine 
o'clock, but I think it is a good 
thing for the children to be at home 
before that hour. Make home pleas- 
ant, and then so train the young 
people that they will love their 
homes and be glad to be there. 
There is no place, for the young 
people, so comfortable and secure 
as the home, with the family — fath- 
ers, mothers, and older brothers 
and sisters, — where the children can 
find good, congenial, company. 
Here they are secure, and associated 
with loved ones whose example and 
influence are always tending for 
good. I believe that the spirit of 
the Gospel will incline us to make 
our homes so desirable, and so 
pleasant, that our children will not 
care to go abroad. They ought to 
feel disinclined to go abroad at 
night. I would not frighten them, 
but they should be made to feel 
more comfortable and safe at home 
than anywhere else. Let them at- 
tend the pleasure resort in the day 
time, instead of at night. Let them 
be so trained that they will enjoy 
home reading and home society at 
night; make them feel that there 
is no place so comfortable, so safe, 
and congenial, as the home. They 
will never go astray while they are 
in good company. It is nice to have 
the proper influence in the home, 



and the spirit of the Gospel have 
its modifying effect upon the chil- 
dren of the Latter-day Saints. 

Then, the children should be giv- 
en proper employment. There is 
nothing more dangerous than idle- 
ness. It is a good thing for boys 
and girls to be trained to labor. 
They ought not to be injured by la- 
bo'r that thev are not competent to 
perform; but there is more likeli- 
hood of injury and danger in idle- 
ness, more danger of being crippled 
and spoiled by idleness than by la- 
bor. In labor there is salvation ; 
in labor there is safety. The skill 
that may be obtained, and the ex- 
perience and the love for skilled la- 
bor, is a training that is most valu- 
able for the children of men. The 
Latter-day Saints, of all people, 
should be industrious ; as a rule, 
fathers and mothers are so. Chil- 
dren, however, are too often in- 
dulged in idleness. Parents some- 
times wait upon their children, 
make their ways too easy, and bring 
them up to be extravagant in the 
expenditure of money. It would be 
very much better if they were 
taught to earn what they receive ; to 
feel that what they wear, and what 
they live upon and enjoy, they ac- 
tually earn with their own hands. 
There is a joy that comes to those 
who earn what they possess, who 
make their living by the sweat of 
their brows. I believe the Lord so 
designed. I believe that we are con- 
structed to work with hands and 
brain. 

We should be faithful ; we should 
love one another, and love man- 
kind ; do good to all men, and re- 
member, as we were so beautifully 
taught this morning by President 
Smith, that our salvation must come 
through righteousness, humility and 
integrity. We cannot be redeemed 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and saved otherwise. We cannot 
be saved without repentance, and 
repentance requires works of refor- 
mation and righteousness. Every 
Latter-day Saint has taken upon 
himself or herself the name of the 
Lord, and we are expected to walk 
in His footsteps, to exercise the 
same charity that He did, the same 
spirit of obedience and humility, 
seeking to know the mind and will 
of the Father, and always doing it. 
We should remember that we have 
but a little time in this world ; that 
this school in which we are entered 
is ours for only a brief season. It 
will be profitable to us if we lay a 
proper foundation and build upon 
it, showing by our lives that we are 
in earnest, that we are sincere, and 
that we keep the commandments of 
the Lord. This will manifest our 
principles and make us a peculiar 
people, with temperance, union, 
faith, devotion, prayerfulness, in- 
tegrity, and with loyalty to the Lord 
and to our government. 

The Lord has placed us under a 
government that is the most re- 
markable in the earth— a nation 
that has the strength and power to 
protect its people. It is growing 
and developing that strength and 
power which will make the king- 
dom of God safe upon this land. It 
will be a land of liberty in the fu- 
ture, as it has been in the past. It 
will continue so, for there shall be 
no king to rule in this land, until 
the King of heaven rules, whose 
right it is to reign among all na- 
tions and all peoples. It will be a 
land of freedom, and the Church of 
Christ will extend until it covers the 
face of the earth. This government 
will contribute very materially to 
the protection of the kingdom of 
God. It has done this in the. past, 
and will do so in the future. How 



grateful we ought to be for liberty 
— religious and personal, and for 
the freedom that reigns so gener- 
ously in the country where we live. 
The Lord has so ordered and ar- 
ranged matters that the safety of 
this nation is assured ; that in this 
country, where His Church has 
been established, we shall .enjoy 
freedom; that we shall not be re- 
moved, but shall remain and hold 
our footing — not only in the state 
of Utah but in surrounding states, 
for we will be sought after. The 
Latter-day Saints are a good ele- 
ment, and they will always be de- 
sirable citizens. They will be ap- 
preciated more hereafter than they 
have been in the past ; for they are 
a stable people/a people of peace, of 
righteousness, justice, sobriety, in- 
tegrity, and honesty, and they will 
be appreciated in the world. 

The leaven of the Gospel is leav- 
ening the lump, and it will have 
influence and power among the peo- 
ples of the earth. The very choic- 
est and best elements are being 
gathered from the various nations; 
and a race of people will spring up 
from the Latter-day Saints that 
will be remarkable for strength, 
physical force, mental qualifica- 
tions, intelligence, and their erudi- 
tion. The Latter-day Saints are pe- 
culiar because they attend to their 
own business ; they never interfere 
with other people; never take ex- 
ceptions to the line of faith of oth- 
ers, whatever it may be. We find no 
fault with them; are willing that 
they should have the faith of their 
fathers or of their own, as they 
please. All Latter-day Saints 
want is that they may have their lib- 
erty to do what they understand is 
proper and right, to develop the 
principles of the Gospel and show 
their virtue for the salvation of

men. We want liberty, and we 
grant it to everybody else. 

The Latter-day Saints are mak- 
ing commendable progress in the 
earth. Throughout the country 
they are building up stakes, increas- 
ing in their wards, making improve- 
ment and advancement, becoming 
thoroughly established. The Priest- 
hood is being employed, and is 
working better today than ever be- 
fore. I believe that we are sending 
a superior quality of Elders into 
the world ; more of the veterans are 
being brought into service with the 
young men, so we are not depend- 
ing altogether upon the untrained. 
Complaints have come from our 
missions that they have too few ex- 
perienced men; they want more 
men who have seen service, and 
such are now being sent into the 
fields. It is important that men 
who bear the Priesthood should 
seek to accomplish all they can with 
that divine authority while they en- 
joy it here in the flesh. We will 
find that the little time allotted to 
us here is very important, and that 
we can't afford to waste it, but that 
every moment of our lives should 
be profitably occupied. Of course, 
we must make a living, subdue the 
earth, develop the resources, accum- 
ulate wealth and use it for the build- 
ing up of the kingdom; but our 
chief mission is to preach the Gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus, to live it, 
and to show to the world its value. 

We should thank the Lord for 
the ministry and mission of the Sa- 
vior, and that the resurrection has 
been wrought out for us. We should 
thank the Lord that we have been 
provided for, that our sins may be 
forgiven, that we may be redeemed 
from the fall, and that we may be 
brought back into the presence of 
the Father. We should feel grate- 



ful for the restoration of the Gos- 
pel in our day, and thank the Lord 
that we live at the time when the 
Gospel is upon the' earth, for it is 
one of the most remarkable priv- 
ileges to live when the Gospel is 
here. Without it there are disputa- 
tions and contentions, and there is 
not the true light. For centuries 
the world had been without the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus, — only the 
printed word, and the printed word 
is the dead letter — it takes the spir- 
it to give it life. Men are not able 
to take the dead letter and bring 
life out of it. The Spirit of the 
Lord can inspire men's hearts, that 
they may read and understand ; but 
with the natural spirit of man in- 
fluenced by the spirits that are * 
abroad in the earth, man cannot 
bring out of the Scriptures the plan 
of life and salvation. Although the 
Book of Mormon contains the Gos- 
pel of Jesus in its fulness, yet men 
must have the Spirit of the Lord 
to comprehend the doctrines there- 
in. They are made very plain in 
the Book of Mormon and in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, but men, 
of their own wisdom and judgment, 
cannot comprehend the truth. By 
the inspiration of the Lord, men are 
enabled to know the truth, and it 
brings life and salvation to them. 

Through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, the Lord has given us the 
way of salvation. He was true to 
his testimony, and his successors 
have followed in his footsteps faith- 
fully. The successors to the apos- 
tles of the latter days have general- 
ly endured in the faith ; they have 
cerved the Lord and gone to their 
reward, many of them, but the work 
remains and will continue to spread 
abroad. The Lord will never be at 
a loss for men to stand as His rep- 
resentatives at home or abroad, in

the ministry ; and this work will ac- 
complish what the Lord designed. 
We witness the integrity of our 
brethren who preside in the various 
departments of the kingdom, their 
devotion and faithfulness to the will 
of God. We are gratified to note 
that the work is progressing and 
gaining strength in the earth. Pres- 
ident Smith has spoken of the union 
of the Presidency, the Twelve, and 
the Seventies. It is also true in re- 
gard to the presidencies of stakes, 
the high-councils, the bishops, the 
quorums of the priesthood, and the 
superintendencies of the auxiliary 
associations in the Church. We 
travel among the people, and labor 
among them, and we discover that 
same union among the brethren and 
sisters who hold responsible posi- 
tions in the Church, and the same 
spirit is in their hearts' as dwells in 
ours. They are taking better care 
of affairs in their stakes, wards, and 
associations than ever before. They 
are learning, and they are receiving 
such training and experience in 
handling these affairs in all the 
fifty-five stakes of Zion that it is 
now a rare thing for appeals to 
come up to the Presidency of the 
Church. When appeals have come 
to the Presidency, it has generally 
been found that justice and right- 
eousness have been dealt out by the 
councils in the stakes. I have not 
known of an instance where the 
First Presidency have discovered 
that the presidency of a stake and 
the high council have done injus- 
tice to the litigants. In these coun- 
cils we find the same wisdom, judg- 
ment, spirit and justice that exists 
with the Presidency and the Twelve. 
The same spirit and power is mani- 
fest according to the responsibili- 
ties that rest upon the brethren. 
The Lord requires of our brethren 



who preside in the stakes of Zion, 
with the high councils and the Bish- 
ops, to take care of their own trou- 
bles, to settle difficulties, to make 
peace, and to deal out justice and 
righteousness ; only those matters 
that are too serious for them to 
handle should ever be brought to 
the attention of the First Presi- 
dency. I believe that the brethren 
who preside today have had such 
experience that they are becoming- 
competent to deal with their affairs, 
they understand the requirements 
made of them in this regard, and 
are doing their full duty. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, and may His Spirit be with 
us henceforth, and particularly to 
the close of this conference. That 
the Lord will indicate His mind and 
will to the people who shall gather 
here from day to day, as He has 
always done, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

I have enjoyed the remarks that 
were made by the brethren during 
the session of the conference this 
morning, and the goodly instruc- 
tion that has come from the lips of 
President Lyman in his conversa- 
tion here this afternoon. I believe 
that the attendance is among the 
greatest we have ever had upon the 
first day, unless that day has come 
upon the Sabbath. I believe it to 
be indicative of a feeling in the 
souls of the Saints of their desire to 
be in touch with the Church and its 
onward movement in the world.

Brother Lund informed us this 
morning that the returns from the 
various fields of labor in which El- 
ders are at present ministering, in- 
dicates an extension of the cause 
that we love. I trust that such will 
continue to be the case, until the 
great obligation that rests upon the 
Latter-day Saints in regard to their 
brothers and sisters in all parts of 
the world, shall have been dis- 
charged in all honor. I trust, fur- 
ther, that, in the continued awaken- 
ing, thousands who have in the 
past been in some measure informed 
concerning the nature of the Lord's 
work, will be inclined to listen and 
accept the whole truth. I believe 
such will be the case. But, that we 
may be successful, to the proper 
limit, among that class of men and 
women who are considered by the 
world as in some degree better ed- 
ucated, and better informed, being 
more scholarly than the mass of 
their fellows, it will be requisite 
that we shall accomplish more here- 
after in the educational line among 
ourselves. There is not a necessity 
for sending any person into the 
world today to preach the Gospel of 
the Redeemer who is unable to read 
and write. There may have been a 
time, in the early introduction of 
the work, when some very choice 
men and women accepted the testi- 
mony of the truth, and became en- 
thused with the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, who could go into the 
field with meager education, and 
labor effectively. They could de- 
clare Christ and Him crucified, tes- 
tify of the goodness and mercy of 
our heavenly Father, and proclaim 
the fact of the visitation of heaven- " 
ly messengers, and the restoration 
of the Gospel in its fulness and pur- 
ity, among the children of men. It 
is my belief that not alone are the 



members of our Father's great fam- 
ily who have lacked in the opportu- 
nities of worldly education, and 
have been limited in their knowl- 
edge of letters, entitled to hear the 
Gospel, but the brightest minds of 
the world should also have the priv- 
ilege of hearing the truth from per- 
sons who have acquired light and 
knowledge from among the wise 
and prudent educators of mankind. 

It seems to me that every child of 
our Father, blessed with intellectual 
power, with industry, and perse- 
verance, with an abiding love of the 
best that can be found in the world, 
should be most successful in secur- 
ing an understanding of these eter- 
nal truths which God has revealed 
and be better able to impart them 
to his fellow men. When we re- 
member that among the early reve- 
lations of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, given 
to the boy Prophet, was one show- 
ing that the degree of intelligence 
at which we arrive in this life is to 
continue with us in the life to come, 
no man or woman should be an 
idler in the line of utilizing the in- 
tellectual powers, in gathering ev-' 
idences of the divine will that 
would make an impress so deep and 
thorough upon their souls that thev 
could readily perceive the handi- 
work of God. 

No wonder that those gifted 
of the Almighty in unraveling 
mysteries of the universe should 
exclaim, when light dawned upon 
their minds, and new thoughts were 
engendered in their souls, "What 
hath God wrought ?" Such was the 
expression of the man who un- 
locked to the world the principles of 
the electric telegraph, and such is 
the sentiment of all men devoted to 
the well-being of the human race, 
who look for the advancement, ex-

tension, and spread of everything 
that is noble and good. 1 

It was a revelation of the divine 
will that declared to the boy- 
Prophet, "The world is in dark- 
ness, but the Spirit of God shall be 
poured out upon the human family, 
young men shall dream dreams, and 
your old men shall see visions, and 
the Spirit of the Lord shall be 
poured out upon all flesh." The 
key was turned, and spiritual light 
was let into the world by the visita- 
tion of the Father and the Son. It 
was increased in the ministrations 
of those angelic beings who under- 
stood the beginning from the end, 
and who inspired the soul of this 
chosen instrument of our Father; 
introducing the spiritual element of 
truth again among the children of 
men, writing it in their souls that it 
should never be effaced. It was 
the same God who gave revelations 
that conveyed keys of knowledge in 
the interests of the human race that 
are manifest in the great lines of 
improvement seen upon the right 
hand and upon the left. The di- 
vine light touched the heart of a 
Morse. It reached the minds of 
hundreds of others, who in various 
fields, sought to unravel the mys- 
teries of the universe, and present 
to the children of the world the ac- 
complishments that we see to-day. 
Our brothers go to the ends of the 
earth, heralding these truths upon 
the steamships and railroads of the 
world, conversing over the tele- 
phone from home to home, from 
city to city, from county to county 
and from state to state in all parts 
of the world. These are some evi- 
dences of the inspiration of heaven 
which has touched the hearts of His 
children, and pointed them to the 
way of life. In every direction are 
seen the evidences of revelation, 



truths that affect the material in- 
terests of the human race, and also 
affect their spiritual well-being in 
the world. 

A few days ago, in Sacramento, 
I listened to a gentleman explaining 
the results of some of his own ef- 
forts in the interests of his fellow 
men. He was a modest, quiet, and 
retiring man, but I could read in 
the expressions of his face, in look- 
ing upon him and in listening to his 
words, that there was in his soul a 
touch of the divine, that was mov- 
ing him forward in the direction of 
the betterment of his fellows, aid- 
ing them in securing results which 
cause them to say, with the grand 
old man before referred to, "What 
hath our God wrought !" 

And this body of men and women 
who are congregated here beneath 
the shades of this roof today, un- 
der the inspiration of that faith 
which God has given them, as they 
look around can exclaim, "What 
hath our God wrought!" in con- 
nection with the work of the Lord. 
He has called us from the ends of 
the earth; He has turned the keys 
of Eternal Truth, never, mind it, 
never to be taken from the earth, 
and never given to another people. 
Its mission is the regeneration and 
uplifting of the human race. The 
spirit of revelation came from the 
Father and the Son. It has extend- 
ed and spread in the declaration of 
the principles of faith. It has gone 
forward in the development of the 
world. It has opened the doorway 
to the great family of our Father, 
and is causing, them in all the world 
to turn their faces Zionward, and to 
recognize that the forces put in mo- 
tion by our Father in Heaven will 
be utilized to accomplish His di- 
vine will. Nothing but rejoicing 
and pleasure and satisfaction should 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

be ours. The spirit of restlessness 
and discontent that is manifest in 
some parts of our land should cease. 
Every man and every woman, every 
believer in the doctrines of the Re- 
deemer of the World, should be 
found engaged in the accomplish- 
ment of God's purposes, blessing all 
men and wronging none, calling the 
thoughtless and vicious to repent- 
ance, opening the door to the un- 
derstanding of the wise and pru- 
dent, proclaiming that the voice of 
the Eternal One has been again 
heard in the world, declaring lib- 
erty to the human race, calling them 
to repentance and obedience to the 
Gospel of the Son of God. 

My brothers and sisters, I be- 
lieve we should congratulate our- 
selves upon the possession of the 
gem of gems ; that our hearts 
should be alive to the full purpose 
of the work that is ours; that our 
souls should be bent upon applying, 
as far as lies within our power, in 
the control and government of our- 
selves, the principles embraced in 
this glorious work. Ours should 
be the grandest manhood and wom- 
anhood the world has ever seen. 
Wherever we go, with whomsoever 
we mingle, they should feel the im- 
press of that dignity which the 
Spirit of our Father writes in the 
soul of the repentant man or wom- 
an, who purpose to do the bidding 
of the Master. The key was turned ; 
the light was let in upon the world. 
It will extend until everything that 
is noble, and good for the well-be- 
ing of every child of .our Father, 
will be applied along those lines des- 
ignated in the opening of this 
work to the world, when the Fath- 
er and the Son pointed the way of 
life to the children of men, and set 
agencies to work to cause them to 
repent and turn to the ways of life. 



My brothers and sisters, with you 
I rejoice in this great work. I re- 
joice in the liberty that is ours in 
this land we love so well. I rejoice 
in the knowledge that day by day, 
hour by hour, minute by minute, 
this work and its spirit will spread, 
and the strongest and best the 
world has seen will bow their heads 
in reverence and respect for its 
wonderful accomplishments. But 
work, work is our duty. The sense 
of responsibility, determination, un- 
yielding courage, undying hope, 
prudence and wisdom must be cul- 
tivated by us, and great accomplish- 
ments may be achieved. Our fath- 
ers have given us sinews of truth, 
and have laid upon us the .duty to 
see that our part is well done, and 
the results are as glorious and sure 
as we live or that the sun rises and 
sets. 

God bless you all. Amen.

tions that rest upon us as Latter- 
day Saints. 

I am a firm believer in the teach- 
ings of the Apostle James. I be- 
lieve in the man who is willing to 
do the things which the Lord has 
commanded, and who shows his 
faith by his work. 

I attended a fast meeting last 
Sunday in the morning, and an- 
other in the afternoon; and one of 
the speakers at the latter meeting 
was Sister Anna Snow, an aged 
wife of the late Apostle Erastus 
Snow. She came from Scandina- 
via, and from her childhood had 
been addicted to the use of coffee, 
and thought she could hardly live 
without it; but finally, after reach- 
ing the age of eight-two years, she 
was impressed that she had failed 
to do her duty in that regard, and 
decided, on her eight-third birth- 
day, that she would keep the Word 
of Wisdom still more perfectly, and 
stop drinking coffee. It nearly 
killed her, but she finally succeeded 
in overcoming the habit; and she 
stood up in humility before the peo- 
ple, confessing her failure at not 
having fully kept the Word of Wis- 
dom, and expressed her gratitude 
to the Lord for giving her the abil- 
ity, even at this late date, to over- 
come her failing; and she testified 
to the benefit she has already re- 
ceived because of the improvement 
in her health by obeying this law of 
God. I was profoundly impressed 
with her remarkable testimony, and 
how I did wish that every one of 
our good sisters, and our brethren 
as well, who, year after year, have 
gone on breaking this simple com- 
mandment of the Lord, could have 
been there and listened to her tes- 
timony. I know a great many peo- 
ple have heard sermons on the 
Word of Wisdom for many years, 



which have never made any im- 
pression upon them. I do not know 
how in the world we could make an 
impression upon some people. I 
know many individuals who have 
been labored with diligently in pri- 
vate, as well as by public teaching 
and admonition, but these labors 
have had no effect upon them. I 
feel in my heart that it is my duty 
to try and discover the weak points 
in my nature, and then pray to the 
Lord to help me overcome them. As 
I read the Word of Wisdom, I 
learn that it is adapted to the weak- 
est of all the weak who are or can 
be called Saints ; and I believe that 
it would be a wonderful aid in the 
advancement of the kingdom of 
God if all the Latter-day Saints 
would obey this simple command- 
ment of the Lord. When I heard 
this aged sister testify that in her 
advanced years she had overcome, 
I wished that all Israel could have 
heard that testimony and been im- 
pressed by it. 

I rejoiced in the great good that 
is being accomplished, and the 
progress that is being made by our 
missionaries, as I listened to the re- 
marks made here this morning by 
President Lund, referring to the la- 
bors of Brother Alma O. Taylor, 
President of the Japan mission. But 
there was a mistake in saying 
Brother Taylor had been away five 
years ; he has been absent over six 
years; it is the other young Elders, 
Brothers Caine and Stoker, who 
have been away over five years. In 
the letter Brother Lund referred to, 
Elder Taylor expressed a desire to 
stop, if need me, at least two years 
more to finish the work he felt the 
Lord desired him to accomplish. 
As I listened to Brother Lund's re- 
marks, they brought to mind my as- 
sociation in Japan with Brother 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



23 



Taylor, also with Elders Caine and 
Stoker, and I wished in my heart 
that all of the missionaries who go 
forth . to proclaim the Gospel pos- 
sessed the same spirit of loyalty to 
labor in the mission field as Elders 
Taylor, Caine and Stoker. I had 
many talented missionaries under 
my jurisdiction, while laboring- in 
the European mission, whose re- 
lease was the one bright and shin- 
ing star which they were looking 
forward to. They were not inter- 
ested in their work as much as they 
ought to be. I wish, if it meets with 
the approval of the Presidency of 
the Church, that the letter which 
Brother Lund referred to, from El- 
der Taylor, might be published, be- 
cause I believe that the spirit of it 
would be an inspiration and a ben- 
efit to the youth of Israel. I have 
had the pleasure of hearing it read, 
and would like others to have the 
same privilege. 

The spirit breathed in that letter 
from Brother Taylor, to which we 
have referred, was that eight years 
given to the work of God is as 
nothing. If needed, every servant 
of God with a knowledge of the 
Gospel, ought to be willing to give 
his life to this cause, which is in 
very deed the work of the Master, 
the plan of life and salvation, the 
Gospel of our Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ. When we arrive at a 
full realization of the fact that we 
have in very deed the Pearl of Great 
Price, that the Gospel which we 
have to give to the people of the 
world means life eternal to those 
who embrace and faithfully live it ; 
when we realize this, and when we 
stop to reflect upon the revelation 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery, in which the 
Lord says : "And if it so be that you 
should labor all your days in cry- 



ing repentance unto this people, 
and bring, save it be one soul unto 
me, how great shall be your joy 
with him in the kingdom of my 
Father? And now, if your' joy will 
be great with one soul that you have 
brought unto me into the kingdom 
of my Father, how great will be 
your joy if you should bring many 
souls unto me." Then we will be- 
gin to realize and comprehend and 
understand the magnitude of this 
work. The saving of souls is the 
one great labor of all others that is 
the most valuable, the most impor- 
tant, that will bring to us the bless- 
ings of our Heavenly Father, and 
of our Lord and Master, Jesus 
Christ. 

I was profoundly impressed with 
the remarks made by President Mc- 
Quarrie, of the Eastern States mis- 
sion, in a fast meeting, Sunday last, 
wherein he referred to the fact that 
it is not that which we accumulate, 
not that which we draw unto our- 
selves, that makes men God-like, 
but it is that which we give out. I 
feel sorry for the man or the wo- 
man who has never experienced 
the sweet joy which comes to the 
missionary who proclaims the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ, and brings 
honest souls to a knowledge of the 
truth, and who hears the expres- 
sions of gratitude and thanksgiving 
that come from the hearts of those 
who have been brought by -his la- 
bor to a comprehension of life eter- 
nal. So also do I feel sorrow for 
those who have never experienced 
the sweet joy resulting from reach- 
ing out their hands and helping 
those who were needy. Assuredly 
there is more blessing comes to us 
from giving than in accumulating; 
there is no question of this in my 
mind. There is also more blessing 
comes to us in going forth to pro-

claim the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and laboring- for the salvation of 
the souls of men, than can possibly 
come to us by merely having a 
knowledge of the truth of our re- 
ligion, and then to remain at home 
and mingle and labor in the ordi- 
nary affairs of life, and accumulate 
the wealth of this world that per- 
ishes with the using. One great 
trouble is that we ofttimes lose 
sight of what is the most valuable 
labor for us to perform, the labor 
that will be most pleasing in the 
sight of our heavenly Father. 

I rejoice, as I said in the first of 
my remarks, in the remarkable 
work that is being accomplished to- 
day in spreading the Gospel. I be- 
lieve that the Lord is blessing, and 
will continue to bless, the Elders 
who labor in the vineyard, more 
abundantly in the future than in the 
past. I know that the work now 
being accomplished by Brother 
Chas. W. Penrose in the British 
mission is greater, and the baptisms 
are far in excess of what was ac- 
complished while I was there in the 
mission field, and I rejoice in it. I 
rejoice in the wonderful ability that 
he possesses to inspire the Elders, 
because of his great fund of knowl- 
edge and information, and his rare 
intelligence, by reason of which he 
has that much the start of me and 
many others who have labored in 
the missionary field. 

The revelation that has been re- 
ferred to here by Brother John 
Henry Smith is one that we all 
would do well to remember. I re- 
joice to know that whatever degree 
of intelligence we attain unto in this 
life shall rise with us in the life to 
come, and we shall have just that 
much the advantage of those who 
have not gained intelligence, be- 
cause of their failure to study dili- 



gently. Not only does this apply to 
the life to come, but it applies also 
to this life in which we are now la- 
boring. Brother Penrose has been 
more diligent in storing his mind 
with the things of the kingdom of 
God than I have ever been. There- 
fore, in the providences of God, he 
has just that much the advantage 
of me, and can accomplish greater 
results as the president of the Eu- 
ropean mission than it was possi- 
ble for me to accomplish, because 
of the additional knowledge he pos- 
sesses, which enlarges his ability to 
teach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. I thank God for the strength 
of his body and mind, for the vigor 
that he has in his advanced age, and 
pray that it may grow and strength- 
en with his years. Last Tuesday 
and Wednesday I had the pleasure 
of hearing letters read from him, 
telling of his labors and travels for 
the Gospel, not in a boastful way, 
but with modesty, explaining what 
he had been doing in Germany, 
Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, and 
in the Scandinavian countries. It 
was little less than marvelous to me 
to hear what he was accomplish- 
ing, remembering, as I do, that he 
is 75 years of age. I pray to God 
to prolong his life upon the earth, 
that you and I and many others 
may be benefited by the knowledge 
which he possesses, and by the abil- 
ity he has to explain the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus. 

I ofttimes feel that it is necessary 
for us to stop and reflect, and spare 
time to read, study, and ponder up- 
on the things of God; I know that 
it is necessary for me to do so. I 
am not naturally a student; my 
mind reaches out for the material 
things of this kingdom. You know 
one of the papers published in this 
city says that Heber J. Grant's fa-

vorite song is "We thank Thee, O 
God, for a Prophet," and that he 
spells it "p-r-o-f-i-t." Now there 
may be some truth in this remark ; 
but I do thank my Father in heaven 
for a Prophet of God to lead this 
people. I thank Him for the knowl- 
edge which I possess that I am en- 
gaged in His work, and for the 
knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that Joseph Smith is a Prophet 
of God. I thank my Father in 
heaven, with all the ability I pos- 
sess, that this Gospel of Jesus. 
Christ is spreading upon the face of 
the earth, that honest men and 
women are learning that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are not the degraded 
and deluded people thev have been 
represented to be, that they are not 
the mistaken people the world 
thought they were. I thank the 
Lord ihat as men investigate the 
plan of life and salvation they see 
what it is accomplishing for those 
who have embraced it. 

Many have said that the "Mor- 
mon" people were better than their 
religion. I heard a magnificent 
talk from this stand a few Sundays 
ago by Brother Joseph S. Wells, in 
which he repudiated this statement. 
He told how utterly impossible it 
is for a people to be better than the 
Gospel of our Lord and Master 
Jesus Christ. I respectfully request, 
if it was taken down by our report- 
ers, that the short address of 
Brother Wells' be published in the 
Deseret News. I don't know that 
I ever listened to remarks that im- 
pressed me more profoundly than 
his did upon that occasion, and I 
endorse them with all my heart. No 
man lives today, in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
who is fully living up to the teach- 
ings of the Gospel of our Lord and 
Master Jesus Christ. By and with 



the help of the Lord we are trying 
to do it ; but there is no man in the 
Church of Christ who claims infal- 
libility. We acknowledge our weak- 
nesses, but while we acknowledge 
them we can also proclaim to the 
world our strength, strength in the 
knowledge that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God, and that 
we have the truth to proclaim to the 
world. 

Since we last met here, one of 
the beloved associates in the quor- 
um of the Twelve Apostles has 
passed from this life, Elder George 
Teasdale. No more humble, God- 
fearing, diligent man has ever fal- 
len to my lot to be associated with. 
In the kind providences of the Lord, 
I was called to the Apostleship up- 
on the same day as Elder Teasdale, 
and I labored with him, in season, 
and out, for twenty-four and a half 
years. I ever found him full of hu- 
mility, full of love of his fellows. I 
never saw him angry ; I never 
heard an unkind word fall from his 
lips. I always found that his heart 
was full of love; that he reached 
out for the benefit, uplifting, and 
betterment of humanity; and it 
seemed to me that he was in very 
deed an ideal servant of God, a 
preacher of the plan of life and sal- 
vation. I remember upon one oc- 
casion listening to that grand old 
man, Karl G. Maeser, in the town 
of Baker, in the state of Oregon, as 
he was teaching a class of little 
children, giving them a lesson (I 
believe it was a Religion Class) ; 
and I remember shedding tears of 
gratitude for his inspiration, as I 
listened to him, and with some hu- 
miliation, I thought of my labors, 
ofttimes struggling for the things 
of this world. As I compared my 
life with the life of Karl G. Maeser,

who was devoted entirely to the 
uplifting of the people of God, I 
felt I could sit in the dust at his 
feet. I have ofttimes had this same 
impression while listening to the 
teachings of, and being associated 
with, the late Elder George Teas- 
dale. I don't know when I ever 
felt more annoyed than I did to find 
in the Assembly Hall at the funeral 
of Brother . Teasdale, one of the 
most meager audiences I ever met 
there. I thought to myself, how 
little do the people engaged in the 
ordinary affairs of life realize and 
appreciate the true worth of men. I 
attended a funeral a short time be- 
fore, in that same building, when it 
was literally crowded ; but the great 
attraction of the funeral was that a 
remarkable musical program was 
given. It was advertised who was 
going to sing, and how interesting 
it would be, and the music and the 
flowers were the great attraction. 
But when one of God's servants 
who had devoted almost his entire 
life, as George Teasdale had done, 
to the proclaiming of this Gospel 
in his native and adopted land, and 
who had many times crossed the 
ocean upon missions, lays down his 
life, the ordinary business cares 
kept the people away from his fu- 
neral. Thank God we are not to be 
judged by the opinions of our fel- 
lows, but by the work that we do. 

Once more I say, I love the teach- 
ings of the Apostle James, "Show 



me thy faith without thy works and 
I will show thee my faith by my 
works." Let us be "doers of the 
word." Let us be keepers of the 
commandments of God. Let our 
light so shine that every man seeing 
our good deeds shall glorify God. 
Let those of us who know that this 
is God's work show by our daily 
walk and conversation, by integrity, 
by devotion, by humility, by gener- 
osity, by overcoming the . weak- 
nesses and imperfections of our na- 
.ture, by observing the Word of 
Wisdom, by being liberal in offer- 
ings, by paying an honest tithing to 
God, by attending meetings and re- 
ceiving the bread of life, that we do 
in very deed love the work of God, 
and thus will our acts bear testi- 
mony of its truth ; this is my prayer 
and desire, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays; 
We thank Thee for every blessing 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command. 

Conference was adjourned until 
Saturday, Oct. 5th, at 10 a. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Patriarch John Smith. 



SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, Oct. 5th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Praise to the man who communed with 
Jehovah ! 

Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer — 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him and nations re- 
vere. 

Prayer was offered by Elder 
John G. McQuarrie. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

"The time is far spent, there is little re- 
maining 

To publish glad tidings by sea and by- 
land, 

Then hasten ye heralds ! go forward 
proclaiming : 
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven's 
at hand.

Importance of observing the first great 
commandment. — High percentage of 
children in "Mormon" families. — Re- 
markable statistics. — Great influence of 
environment. — Advantages of Church 
school training. 

Brethren and sisters : I trust that 
I shall be able to make myself heard 
by this vast congregation. I re- 
joiced exceedingly yesterday in lis- 
tening to the strong opening ad- 
dress of President Smith. It was 
an index to the character of the con- 
ference, and of the meetings which 
have followed. 

It was indeed pleasant to listen to 
the powerful testimonv of Presi- 



dent Winder, and to see him in such 
good health. I was also very much 
impressed with the remarks of Pres- 
ident Lund, and of President Ly- 
man', especially with reference to 
the children of the Latter-day 
Saints. We are a people who be- 
lieve in marriage and in children, 
and we not only believe in them, 
but this belief has taken an active 
form, and has become a living prin- 
ciple with us. You will remember 
that, when the Lord placed Adam 
in the Garden of Eden He saw that 
it was not good for man to be alone, 
and He gave him the woman, Eve, 
to be his companion and helpmeet. 
Then again, the Lord saw that it 
was not good for husband and wife 
to be alone, and He said unto them : 
"Be fruitful, and multiply, and re- 
plenish the earth, and subdue it: 
and have dominion over the fish of 
the sea, and over the fowl of the 
air, and over the cattle, and over all 
the earth." As a result of obedi- 
ence to this first great command- 
ment, Adam and Eve were blessed 
with posterity. Woe unto that na- 
tion or people who disregard that 
sacred obligation of marriage, or 
interfere with the fountains of life. 
Every nation which has taken this, 
course has felt the anger of an of- 
fended God. We need only to look 
back to the great Roman Empire 
for an example, and to other na- 
tions before and after. When the 
nations began to disregard and vio- 
late the sacred duty and obligations 
of marriage, weakness and dissolu- 
tion came, and they have disap- 
peared, many of them, from the face 
of the world. As a people, the Lat- 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ter-day Saints, I think I mav safely 
say, aporeciate the glorious princi- 
ple of marriage. In my travels I 
have seen some very large families 
of children. I met one sister who 
was the mother of eighteen- chil- 
dren. I looked upon her as a ver- 
itable queen among women ; her 
crown was studded with eighteen 
precious jewels. I have met other 
sisters in the Church who were the 
mothers of fourteen, fifteen or six- 
teen children, which we will all 
concede are very large families. 
There are hundreds of mothers in 
Israel who have had eight, nine, ten 
eleven, twelve and thirteen children, 
which reflects great credit and hon- 
or upon them. 

If we would understand and com- 
prehend something of the great ob- 
ligation that rests upon us with re- 
spect to these children that God has 
entrusted to our care, it might be well 
for a moment to consider the fol-. 
lowing figures, taken from last 
year's statistical report. Last year 
there were in the Church 86,742 
children under eight years of age, a 
veritable army. If we should assume 
that this Tabernacle would accom- 
modate 15,000 children, then this 
building would be filled five and 
one-half times with children of the 
Latter-day Saints under eight years 
of age. Is not that thought im- 
pressive? The percentage of chil- 
dren in some of the stakes of Zion 
is very high indeed ; and I am sure 
if it were known to the world, it 
would not only create some amaze- 
ment but, with many perhaps, 
would elicit admiration. The high- 
est average is in the Kanab Stake of 
Zion. In that stake 33 per cent of 
the population of the Church are 
children under eight years of age — 
nearly one-third of the population. 
Alberta Stake, in Canada, has 32 



per cent; San Juan Stake, 32 per 
cent; Uintah Stake, 32 per cent- 
Juarez Stake, in Mexico, has 31 
per cent; Panguitch Stake, 31 per 
cent; Woodruff ^Stake, 30 per cent; 
and Snowflake Stake 30 per cent. 
There are thirteen stakes with 29 
per cent, eight stakes with 28 per 
cent; six stakes with 27 per cent, 
seven stakes with 26 per cent, and 
three stakes with 25 per cent. I 
think you will concede with me that 
these are very high averages. There 
is one stake with 19 per cent, and 
two stakes with 18 per cent, which 
is the lowest average. 

Now, if anybody should ask me 
the question: What do you think 
is the most important consideration 
with reference to this vast army of 
children under eight years of age? 
and then: What do you think is 
the most important consideration 
with reference to the children of the 
Latter-day Saints who are above 
eight and up to twenty years of 
age ? ( The latter constitute a vast 
army. We have in the Sunday 
schools an enrollment of 119,000 
souls. There are a few of these 
Sunday school children, under eight 
years of age, some who belong to 
the kindergarten department, but 
most of them are above the age of 
eight, and below the age of twenty. 
There are 24,600 enrolled in the 
Young Men's Association; 26,200 
enrolled in the Young Ladies' ; 48,- 
737 enrolled in the Primary, and 
25, 629 enrolled in the Religion 
Classes. We have in the Church 
4,961 Priests, 6,292 Teachers, and 
18,976 Deacons.) I should say that 
the most important consideration 
with reference to these children 
would be the question of environ- 
ment — environment of the home 
first, and environment of the 
Church second. The child is born

into the home, and remains there 
through the early years of its life, 
U p to manhood or womanhood, and 
anything that occurs within the sa- 
cred precincts of the home must 
have a powerful influence upon the 
mind of the child. It is necessarily 
so, because the youthful mind is 
very impressionable. When we 
look into the home of a Latter-day 
Saint, whenever we reflect about 
this matter, we naturally ask: Is 
the home well ordered? Is family 
prayer observed both morning and 
evening ? Do the parents set a 
proper example before the children ? 
Is reverence for sacred things im- 
pressed upon their minds — rever- 
ence for the Church, reverence for 
the Priesthood, and reverence for 
the parents? The children should 
be taught to respect and honor those 
who gave them birth,and those who 
are placed to instruct and guide them. 
Oh, how important these things are 
to the cause of Zion! Brethren 
and sisters, I repeat, how very im- 
portant is the environment of our 
children in the home ! I think they 
should have first consideration, and 
our profoundest attention as par- 
ents in Israel. 

Then there is the environment of 
the Church. This army of Priests, 
Teachers and Deacons, members of 
the lesser Priesthood, belonging to 
associations wherein they are taught 
to become acquainted with author- 
ity, and taught to exercise authority 
in the ordinances of the Gospel, — 
how important that proper atten- 
tion should be given these young 
men in their quorums ! Then, again, 
there is the environment of our 
auxiliary organizations, mighty en- 
gines for good — if that is a proper 
term — powerful levers in lifting 
the young people from lower to 
higher conditions. And last, but 



not least, the Church school sys- 
tem. You will remember that, 
over thirty years ago, President 
Young directed Karl G. Maeser to 
go to Provo and open a Church 
school. A little later, Brother 
Maeser presented himself to Pres- 
ident Young for instructions: no 
doubt he had prepared his mind to 
receive very minute and ample di- 
rections in respect to this move- 
ment, for it was destined to become 
of great magnitude in Zion. Pres- 
ident Young said to him something 
to this effect: "Brother Maeser, 
you are not to teach even the A B 
C's without the Spirit of God. Every 
study that shall be pursued in the 
Church school over which you are 
appointed to preside must be ac- 
companied by the Spirit of God." 
And he told him that the greatest, 
the supremest study in the Church 
school should be theology. Let me 
say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
from the time Brother Maeser 
opened up that school, with only a 
few in attendance, a handful of stu- 
dents, the system has steadily 
grown and spread, and this year 
there will be enrolled in our Church 
schools about ten thousand stu- 
dents. Is it not a remarkable move- 
ment ? Does it not impress you ? Is 
it not wonderful what God hath 
wrought? I can scarcely think of 
any movement of later times in 
Zion that will have such a profound 
effect and influence upon our chil- 
dren as our Church schools. Why 
is this such an important move- 
ment? Simply because it goes be- 
yond the Sabbath day; it may in- 
clude it, in a way, but it goes be- 
yond, and brings to the child the 
proper religious instruction, and 
the influences of the Gospel, every 
day in the week, every hour in the 
day, and every minute that he is in 



30

the school room. Now it seems to 
me that this is beautiful. I remem- 
ber reading in one of the daily pa- 
pers that the late President Harper 
of the Chicago University, com- 
plained sadly of the absence of re- 
ligious influences in the school 
room; and he freely admitted that 
students who attended that univer- 
sity in his day, and under his in- 
structions, went forth from the 
school with less religion and less 
reverence for sacred things than 
when they came into it; and those 
were the kind of educated students 
who were sent into the world from 
that great institution. It is the same 
with many other institutions of 
learning ; and I think the people of 
the nation are coming to the view 
that there must be religious instruc- 
tion of some kind, at least that the 
Bible should be introduced into the 
public schools of the land. Well, we 
have been converted to that idea 
from the first. One thing that Pres- 
ident Young regretted, with respect 
to the public schools, was that the 
Lord Almighty was excluded, and 
I presume that was what prompted 
him to inaugurate the Church 
school system. . 

Brethren and sisters, as I said 
before, how important is the en- 
vironment of our children. If you 
doubt that there is anything in this 
question of environment, cast your 
thought back to the children of Is- 
rael. You will remember that they 
went down into Egypt as worship- 
ers of the true and living God. No 
doubt they continued to be instruct- 
ed in that worship during their pil- 
grimage in the land of Egypt, while 
they were in bondage. After 400 
years, they were brought forth out 
of bondage, through the power of 
the Almighty, with the fear of God 



before their eyes ; and they walked 
through the Red Sea dry shod; and 
they saw the Lord descend— that 
is, they saw a mighty manifestation 
of His power upon Mount Sinai, 
when the mountain smoked as a 
furnace, the thunder rolled, the 
lightning flashed, and they heard 
the voice of God. And, mind you, 
when Moses, the prophet, the law- 
giver, the leader of Israel, with- 
drew for a short period of time— 40 
days and 40 nights that he was in 
the mount communing with the Al- 
mighty — the children of Israel re- 
belled and worshiped an idol, the 
golden calf; yet they were the'peo- 
ple who had just previously wit- 
nessed the manifestation of God's 
power in their great deliverance 
from bondage. And why did they 
worship the golden calf? It was due 
to their environment in Egypt. 
They had been in bondage 400 
years, and had been surrounded by 
idol worshipers ; their children had 
grown up under these influences, 
and they were affected, in the wil- 
derness, by the environment of their 
early life. 

May the Lord help us, may He 
give us wisdom as a people, as par- 
ents, as officers of the Church, as 
men of Priesthood, and women of 
faith, may He give us wisdom to 
watch over our children and to give 
them good counsel, and to set be- 
fore them examples worthy of all 
acceptation, because the children of 
today are the men and women of to- 
morrow, so to speak; and what- 
ever the children are, the men and 
the women of the future will be. 
Let us lay the foundation deep and 
strong that we may erect there- 
upon a most glorious building, 
which I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH.

ELDER HYRUM M. SMITH. 

Great significance of the revelations im- 
parted to Joseph Smith.— Unchange- 
able character of those revelations.— 
Prevailing religious indifference. — 
Preachers who create unbelief.— Per- 
sonality of God has been clearly dem- 
onstrated—Proper use of the Bible 
in public schools. — Existence and di- 
vinity of Christ made known in this 
age. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
somewhat weighed down this morn- 
ing under the great responsibility 
that rests upon me in occupying this 
position, and in speaking to a con- 
gregation of this character and size. 
Nevertheless, I rejoice greatly that 
I am deemed worthy to bear the re- 
sponsibility, and have the authority 
to testify concerning the divinity of 
the Lord Jesus Christ and His mis- 
sion, and declare the truth of the 
Gospel restoration in this the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times, 
through Joseph Smith, the Prophet. 

As Latter-day Saints, we have 
assembled here for the purpose of 
worshiping God, acknowledging 
Him as our Father in heaven, and 
manifesting our love for Him and 
His Son. The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was es- 
tablished and founded by Joseph 
the Prophet, under the direction and 
inspiration of Jesus Christ, in April, 
1830. The same principles and doc- 
trines of life and salvation that were 
preached by Jesus, during His min- 
istry in the flesh, were revealed to 
Joseph Smith and announced by 
him again to the world. 

Joseph Smith was raised up to 
be, and he is, a Prophet of God. In 
answer to his prayer, the Father 
and the Son appeared to him, to- 
gether, in person, and made known 
to him their divine will. Thereaf- 
ter they sent unto him heavenly 



messengers from their presence, 
and also, by the inspiration of the 
Holy Ghost revealed to him the 
truths of the everlasting Gospel. 
These revelations are written in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, Book of 
Mormon and Pearl of Great Price, 
and if believed in, and practiced, 
will eventually save men in the ce- 
lestial kingdom of our Father. They 
were proclaimed by revelation, as I 
have stated, and up to this time, 
after over seventy-seven years of 
existence of the Church, not one 
principle or doctrine thus revealed 
has been receded from by the mem- 
bers of the Church. We have never 
repudiated any of the truths re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and to his successors in the office of 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We have never re- 
linquished our belief in any one of 
these doctrines and principles. We 
have never called together confer- 
ences or conclaves for the purpose 
of revising the revelations of God. 
We have never been called upon, 
nor found it necessary, in any stage 
of our progress, to eliminate any 
revelation from the record. Neither 
have we ever denied any of them. 
We testify in all soberness that 
these revelations are from God. 
They are therefore the same yester- 
day, today and forever, and are ev- 
erlasting and essential to the salva- 
tion of those unto whom they are 
given. We have adhered faithfully 
to the Gospel of Christ, the religion 
which we have received. As a peo- 
ple, I trust we will always remain 
faithful, firm and steadfast as we' 
are, and even more so, and by 
greater diligence exercise greater 
faith in the Lord. This is a day 
when there is a great falling away 
from the churches, a departure of 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men from their own religions and 
creeds. The things of this world 
are paramount in the estimation of 
the world. We send our Elders 
into the world to preach this Gos- 
pel unto all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and people, and there are 
three classes that they meet. One 
is a class of people that receive 
them gladly when they hear the 
testimony of the truth, and of the 
restoration of the gospel. Their 
hearts swell within them at the 
sound of the voice of the true shep- 
herd, and they listen eagerly. They 
desire to know more; they investi- 
gate earnestly, and perceive the 
truth gladly, and embrace it. Those 
who comprise this class, I say, are 
not very numerous. Then there is 
another class, perhaps quite nu- 
merous, who, the moment they hear 
the testimony thus declared bris- 
tle up and become antagonists, and 
bitter enemies of the truth, and op- 
pose it with all their powers; and 
they scruple at nothing to hinder 
and destroy the work that the El- 
ders are endeavoring to perform. 
Then there is the third class, and 
they are numbered by thousands, 
who are totally indifferent to that 
testimony, or to the testimony of 
any other man who preaches re- 
ligion. Thus we discover that in 
the world the majority of men are 
not inclined to religion. They are 
falling away from religion, depart- 
ing from creeds, and absenting 
themselves from places of worship. 
They do not know anything about 
religion, and they care less about it. 
Now, who are responsible for this 
* condition? There may be many 
things causing this, to a greater or 
less degree, but I believe those who 
are most responsible for the- lack of 
faith are so-called preachers of re- 
ligion. They have sown the seeds 



of unbelief in the hearts of men. 
Being uninspired, and without di- 
vine authority, they by their teach- 
ings have caused men to disbelieve 
in God, the Eternal Father, and 
His Son, Jesus Christ. They make 
certain professions, by way of lip 
service, but they deny the power 
of godliness. They declare that 
God is incomprehensible, that we 
cannot understand Him, and do not 
know Him; that He is without 
body, parts or passions. They de- 
clare that Jesus Christ is not divine. 
They repudiate the miraculous, and 
cast doubt upon the wonderful 
works that Christ wrought, and 
that were performed by His fol- 
lowers, His disciples, in primitive 
times, as recorded in Scripture. Ev- 
erything that does not appeal to 
their particular and narrow sense 
of reason, they denounce as irra- 
tional and untrue. We are not 
afraid of the avowed infidel and 
agnostic, he who comes out openly 
declaring his utter contempt for all 
things that savor of God and re- 
ligion, and ridicules those who do 
believe in them. I believe that true 
religion has never suffered very ma- 
terially on account of the warfare 
made upon it by open and avowed 
enemies who call themselves athe- 
ists and infidels ; neither has true 
faith been much disturbed by such 
attacks, but the trouble is that there 
are those who style themselves 
ministers of religion, who prefix the 
word "Reverend" to their names, 
and under this guise stand in pul- 
pits, and upon the rostrum of re- 
ligious gatherings, and there pro- 
claim the same falsehoods that in- 
fidels have declared, namely, that 
Jesus Christ is not divine, that He 
is not the Redeemer of the world, 
but a mere man, a moralist, it is 
true, a man advanced beyond the

time in which he lived. It is 
all very well to proclaim a be- 
lief in the existence of God, be- 
cause of the glories of the heavens 
and the beauties of earth; all very 
well to say we can see the handi- 
work of God in the mountains, in 
the forests and in the streams of 
water, in the fruits and the flowers 
of the earth, but not any of these 
thing's ever yet convinced men of 
the personality of God. Men may 
gather from these things a belief 
that there is an all-wise and all- 
powerful creator, but none of these 
things bear direct testimony of the 
personality of God, the Father, nor 
of the divinity of Christ the Son. 
These truths must be revealed to 
men, a knowledge of them being 
essential to salvation. Men must 
receive, understand, and impart 
them to their fellow men; and this 
has been done. God has time and 
again revealed Himself to His ser- 
vants the Prophets ; they have seen 
Him, have beheld His person, and 
have discovered the truth of the 
declaration that man was created in 
the image of God. Thus they could 
truthfully testify to others that God 
lives, and that we are His children, 
created in His image. He is not 
only the Creater of the heavens and 
the earth and all that we see that is 
beautiful, useful and desirable in 
them, but He is also the Creator of 
man, and man is in the likeness of 
His person. These things are true. 
Christ declared the truth of them; 
he declared His divinity. He said 
He came into the world to take 
away the sin of the world; and all 
His disciples, who were true to him, 
bore the same testimony, because 
they had seen and heard. So, the 
responsibility for the indifference 
we find so universal on the part of 
men towards the Gospel rests large- 



ly upon those who claim to be min- 
isters, and pose as preachers of the 
Gospel of Christ, and at the same 
time teach that Christ is not divine, 
that God did not create man, and 
that there are no such things as 
miracles, revelations, gifts, and so 
on and so forth. While pretending 
to preach the doctrines of Christ 
they, at the same time, deny most 
of them. The personality of God, 
the divinity of His Son, the creation 
of man, the fall of Adam, the atone- 
ment, the resurrection, eternal life, 
celestial glory, etc., etc., are doc- 
trines now discredited by many of 
them. Little wonder that men have 
grown tired of and become indif- 
ferent to, a Gospel stripped of 
nearly all its essentials. Such hy- 
pocrites and religion fakers as these 
are responsible for the condition of 
irreligion that we find in the world. 
And if this is the result of preach- 
ing the Gospel of Christ, so-called, 
and reading the Bible in churches, 
we may well pause before introduc- 
ing such reading in the public 
schools. 

I can see no remedy for this con- 
dition, only in the unequivocal ac- 
ceptance of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ as He declared it in His day, 
and as it has been restored in our 
own day. Men must believe in 
God; they must believe that He is 
our Father, that He created us and 
established us here; and He shall 
welcome us again in His presence. 
We must believe that Jesus is the 
Redeemer of the world, and accept 
Him as such. We must accept the 
doctrines He taught, and put them 
into practice in our lives, if the 
reading of the scripture, His word, 
will do us any good. So long as 
we have infidels, skeptics and un- 
believers in the public schools, men 
who do not understand the Bible

and cannot make proper explana- 
tion of its contents, I sav, to read it 
in the schools and, as some minis- 
ters do, disparage the belief in Jesus 
Christ and the miracles He 
wrought,and the great work of re- 
demption He accomplished, would 
be more disastrous than beneficial 
by far. Until such time as men can 
read the Bible and the Scriptures 
understandingly, by the power of 
the Holy Ghost, in the spirit in 
which they were written, I am not 
prepared to declare my belief in 
the efficacy of teaching it in the 
public schools. 

It is folly for men to say Jesus 
Christ is not divine, and that He 
was just a great moral teacher, a 
man in advance of His time, and 
then advise men to follow Him; 
for, either He is Christ, the Son of 
God, who came from the Father to 
take away the sin of the world, and 
to die for the redemption of man, 
or He is not. If He is, He is worthy 
of the respect and confidence even 
of the lowest among men. He is 
either what He represented Him- 
self to be, or He is not, in any sense 
of the term, because He declared 
Himself to be the Son of God. He 
proclaimed, "I am the way, the 
truth and the life; no man cometh 
to God save by me." Men can come 
to God in that way only, or else the 
Son of Man told an untruth, and 
lying is far from being a moral hab- 
it. He declared, furthermore: "I 
am the resurrection and the life; 
whosoever liveth and believeth in 
me shall never die." "Whosoever 
believeth in Me, though he were 
dead yet shall he live." He said 
again: "Go ye into all the world 
and preach the Gospel unto every 
creature; he that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved, and he that 
believeth not shall be damned." 



None but the Messiah Himself 
could make such statements and 
speak the truth. He was what He 
announced Himself to be, and what 
we declare Him to be, or else He 
performed a most arrogant and im- 
moral act in assuming to be He 
who could forgive sins, and who 
could save men from their sins and 
lift them up, and exalt them in the 
presence of God. 

My brethren and sisters, every 
page, almost, of the Holy Scrip- 
tures bears record and attests the 
divinity of Christ. Christ Himself 
declared it. John the Baptist said 
to the multitude/'Behold, the Lamb 
of God who taketh away the sin of 
the world." Peter, James and John, 
Matthew, Mark, Luke, Paul and 
many of the other disciples of 
Christ likewise bore testimony,with- 
out doubt, that He was divine and 
is the Redeemer of the world. And 
in our own day, we bear the same 
testimony, for the same things have 
been revealed anew. Joseph Smith 
was visited by Him and God His 
Father, and he beheld them 
with his own eyes. Joseph Smith 
and Sidney Rigdon also saw him, 
and bore testimony that they saw 
Him, even as Stephen saw Him, 
clothed in glory, surrounded by 
those inhabiting the celestial king- 
dom of God. They also saw God 
seated on His throne and Jesus 
Christ at His right hand, "and they 
heard the voice bearing record that 
He is the only begotten of the 
Father." So far as the Latter- 
day Saints are concerned, we know 
these things are true. There is no 
doubt in our minds about it. Why? 
Because the Spirit of Truth, the 
Holy Ghost, has been received by • 
us, through our obedience to the 
laws and ordinances of the Gospel, 
and he, true to His office, has testi-

fied to us of Jesus Christ, our Lord. 

May God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters. May you prove faith- 
ful all your lives. May you, as we 
have up to this time done, adhere 
faithfully to every precept, every 
doctrine, and every truth that_has 
been revealed in this dispensation 
by God, through Joseph Smith, for 
the salvation of the children of men. 
I rejoice in the Everlasting Gospel. 
I know it is true. I know that God 
lives, that Jesus Christ is our Lord 
and Savior, and that by obedience 
to the laws and ordinances which 
He Himself yielded obedience to, 
and commanded all men to obey, we 
shall be saved in the kingdom of our 
Father. May we be saved. May 
we labor diligently to counteract the 
influences of indifference, unbelief, 
and agnosticism which now prevail 
so extensively among men in the 
world. 

God bless the Presidency of the 
Church, and the Twelve Apostles, 
and the Seven Presidents of the 
Seventy, and the Patriarch. May 
He likewise bless, according to their 
callings and their necessities, the 
Presidents of stakes, their Counsel- 
ors, and High Councilors, Bishops 
of wards and their Counselors, and 
those who preside in the auxiliary 
organizations, or in branches of the 
Church. • May He be with the 
Presidents of Missions to inspire 
them and to equip them for 
their great and responsible du- 
ties in declaring the truth; and 
may He bless each and every 
individual missionary laboring un- 
der their direction for the spread of 
the everlasting Gospel into all the 
world, as a witness before the end 
shall come. This is my prayer in 
behalf of the Church and the ser- 
vants of God, and of all men of 
God and the just in all the world, 



and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

A contralto solo, "O Love Di- 
vine," was beautifully rendered by 
little Sister Millie Williams. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

Children a priceless heritage from the 
Lord. — Childless homes a national ca- 
lamity. — Beautiful examples of affec- 
tion for destitute children. — An ap- 
peal to the childless to adopt homeless 
orphans. — A splendid way to help mis- 
sion work. — A missionary magazine. 

I am sure that all who are here 
today have been edified by the in- 
struction we have received, and can 
testify that the sweet influence of 
the Spirit of our Father, that was 
so bountifully poured out upon us 
yesterday, has been continued. 

I was very much impressed with 
the report made by Brother Claw- 
son concerning the exceedingly 
large number of children in the 
homes of the Latter-day Saints, and 
I was reminded of a passage of 
Scripture that is often referred to 
in tenderness, and that has been il- 
lustrated upon canvas by some of 
the greatest painters of the world. 
When the Savior was surrounded 
by a multitude, and He was lay- 
ing His hands upon the heads of 
small children and blessing them, 
His Apostles suggested that they 
trouble Him not. He then made use 
of the memorable saying that we all 
cherish, "Suffer little children to 
come unto me and forbid them not, 
for of such is the kingdom of 
heaven." If it be true that nearly 
one-third of the population of some 
of our stakes are very young chil- 
dren, not yet accountable for sin, 
then indeed, in those stakes there 
should be an outpouring of the 
Spirit of the Lord that should be 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



felt in every home. As a people we 
believe in children. We believe 
that they are an heritage given to 
us by our Father in heaven. We 
can understand how, in the olden 
times, as recorded in the Scriptures, 
when some of the grand women of 
Israel were childless, and deprived 
of the joy of having little arms 
cling around their necks, and sweet 
innocent lips to give them the kiss 
of childish affection, they cried un- 
to the Lord that they might have 
children, to take away their re- 
proach. We understand what that 
means, if we understand the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ; and we com- 
prehend that one child, born under 
proper conditions and reared un- 
der suitable circumstances, is worth 
more than all the cattle and sheep 
upon a thousand hills, aye, than all 
the treasures of the world. That 
is why, as Latter-day Saints doing 
our duty, we welcome these price- 
less treasures from the throne of 
God when they come into our 
homes. In the world it is not al- 
ways so, but, lacking understand- 
ing, some are stopping the springs 
of life, and assuming the responsi- 
bility of cutting off posterity, by 
avoiding fulfilment of the great 
commandment given to our first 
parents, to "multiply and replenish 
the earth." Children are the off- 
spring of God, their spirits were 
begotten in the holy heavens of our 
Father, and they are given to us for 
our blessing. We, as stewards, are 
permitted to receive them in their 
infancy, to educate and prepare 
them, not alone that they may be- 
come great in this world and bring 
honor to us here, but by observing 
the laws of God, that they may live 
again with us in the presence of 
our Father, throughout the endless 
ages of eternity. 



I was reading a short time ago 
that in France the birthrate is di- 
minishing so rapidly that it is 
viewed as a national calamity, and 
a national association, which is 
studying the matter, has reached 
the conclusion that any couple rais- 
ing more than three children merit 
public gratitude and protection. In 
this connection, I am reminded of 
the remark of a gentleman not of 
our faith who lives in the East 
whose home is childless, who met, a 
few months ago, one of our sisters 
who is the mother of thirteen chil- 
dren, and she, by the way, sits in 
the congregation today. (God bless 
her. ) She had told him she was the 
mother of thirteen children, and he 
said to me, "Mr. Smith, I took my 
hat off to her. She was deserving 
of great honor." 

I saw in the press a few days ago 
a report that there is a union of 
women, in one portion of Europe, 
who have agreed that they would 
give birth to no more children, and 
members of their organization are 
traveling among the people teach- 
ing this pernicious doctrine, and 
many have joined the deplorable 
union. I wondered if they realize 
that, of all the blessings God had 
been good enough to bestow upon 
them, of all the privileges that they 
might enjoy in this life, they are 
blindly rejecting the most priceless 
of all ; I thought that, if the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ could but touch 
their hearts, if they could compre- 
hend that this is a part of the great 
plan of our Father, if they could 
understand that the purpose of their 
existence in this world is that they 
might have joy, and that joy could 
come to them in perfection only by 
being the mothers of sons and 
daughters, how differently they 
would act. No Latter-day Saint 



ELDER GEORGE A. SMITH. 37 



woman, understanding 1 or compre- 
hending the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
will refuse the legitimate opportu- 
nity to bear sons and daughters in 
the image of God. No man prop- 
erly realizing his privileges and op- 
portunities, would do anything to 
prevent himself being a father in 
Israel, and having the privilege of 
rearing and educating children cre- 
ated in the likeness of our Father 
whom we worship. But our breth- 
ren and sisters in some parts of the 
world fail to understand that, and, 
in the place of sweet, innocent chil- 
dren, and the prattle and joyous 
laughter of those of whom our 
Father has said, "Their angels are 
ever present with me," we find 
dogs, birds and cats receiving the 
affection and taking the place of 
those jewels that the Lord intended 
should embellish the crown of ev- 
ery good man and woman in the 
world, who are capable of being 
fathers and mothers. 

A few years ago a family con- 
sisting of father, mother and sev- 
eral children, residing in Bear Lake 
Stake, took a little child from the 
orphanage and gave it a home. I 
have queried what the result would 
be, and whether it would be satis- 
factory. Yesterday this same moth- 
er came to my house with a little 
boy, five years old, she had just re- 
ceived from the Orphan's Home 
and Day Nursery, and was en route 
to her home with him. That was 
sufficient answer for me. The first 
sacrifice has been suitably rewarded 
and the joy experienced in the de- 
velopment of the first child has 
opened the door of welcome to an- 
other little stranger. I questioned 
the little fellow, yesterday, as to 
his knowledge of animals, etc., and 
learned that he was fond of them. 
I told him he was going to live 



where they had horses, cows, sheep 
and chickens. His face lighted up 
and he asked, "Can I have some, 
too?" in such an eager way that it 
almost brought tears to my eyes. A 
new world was opening for him. 
The narrow limits of the orphan- 
age were stretching out, and he was 
beginning to realize that there was 
some place in the world that would 
be home to him, somebody he could 
call mother. He was dressed in a 
nice new suit, and as he stepped 
aboard the train, in the care of that 
good woman, I could not but feel 
that the Lord would accept the of- 
fering of the family in opening 
their home to the little man. I pray 
that He will bless them for the 
good they do this orphan child. 

Only a few months ago there was 
brought to this city a little child, 
whose mother had died and the 
father was unable to take care of it 
in a suitable way. The question 
was raised, "What stiall we do with 
the child?" A daughter of one of 
the most prominent brethren in the 
Church, a girl only 17 years old, 
responded surprisingly. She had 
no parrot, no dog, no little pet 
lamb, but she had a number of 
brothers and sisters whom she had 
learned to love and cherish. She 
had been reared in a Latter-day 
Saint home, and understood the 
duty of doing good to the children 
of our Father. She knew what it 
meant when the Lord said, "Inas- 
much as ye do it unto the least of 
one of these ye do it unto me," and 
she requested her parents that she 
might take that little child and care 
for it until other suitable provision 
could be made for it. She received 
permission, and gladly gave her 
time, day and night, for baby's 
comfort. That daughter of Zion 
did something in assuming such a 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



responsibility that would surely en- 
dear her to all good people; and 
the Father of us all will not be un- 
mindful of her consideration of one 
of His little ones. 

How will those feel who fail to 
obey that first great command when 
they stand in the presence of the 
creator, who says to them, as He 
said to those in olden times, "Suf- 
fer little children to come unto me, 
and- forbid them not, for of such is 
the kingdom of heaven." How can 
they comply with that invitation if 
they have no children to take to 
the Father? They must remain 
childless throughout eternity. They 
have been blind to their rights and 
privileges. It is only by a proper 
understanding of the laws of God, 
and by compliance with the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, only by doing what 
the Lord has said we should do, 
that we will enjoy the fulness of 
happiness that our Father in heaven 
has promised those who are faith- 
ful. I do not feel to censure, but 
with all my heart I pity the man 
and woman who grace their home 
with the lesser animals of God's 
creation, and keep away from their 
firesides those angels from His 
presence who might be theirs 
through time and through all eter- 
nity. I realize there are some men 
and women who are grieved be- 
cause they are not fathers and 
mothers, thev are not blessed of the 
Lord in that particular, they haye 
r.c children of their own, and by no 
f f ult of their own. I believe the 
Lord will provide in such cases. If 
they will do their duty in keeping 
the other commandments, their re- 
proach will be taken away. I raise 
my voice among the sons and 
daughters of Zion, and warn you 
that if you dry up the springs of 
life and abuse the power that God 



has blessed you with, there will 
come a time of chastening to you, 
that all the tears you may shed will 
never remove. Remember the first 
great commandment ; fulfill that ob- 
ligation. 

Are there any here who have no 
children in their homes? If there 
are such, I say to you that in the 
orphanage, near this city, there are, 
I am told, thirty or forty little chil- 
dren. They are being fed and 
clothed and kept from the cold, and 
are nursed when they are sick, but 
they know not what it is to receive 
the affectionate embrace of loving 
parents that most of you have en- 
joyed. They know not the joy of 
roaming the fields and woods, and 
having toys and pets like children 
who have parents to care for them. 
Oh, how they would appreciate a 
real home ! There are many child- 
less homes, where the presence of 
these children would be a God's 
blessing; and there should be no 
orphan child depending upon char- 
ity in this land. If you have no 
children of your own, if you realize 
the admonition of the Savior, then 
some of you who desire this bless- 
ing should reach out your arms and 
adopt some of these homeless chil- 
dren. And, though they may not 
prove in all respects all that you 
could wish, the intent of your heart 
will be rewarded by the Father who 
knows your desire to do good. I 
do not hesitate to say that the bless- 
ing that will return to the one 
whose home is opened to a child 
without parents will not only be 
that they will rejoice in the growth 
and development of that child, but 
that other blessings of our Father 
will be added to them in proportion 
to their good works. If there 
strayed into your dooryard a fine 
colt or calf, without an owner, and

no prospect of anybody claiming it 
would you cast it. out ? Wouldn't 
you consider it valuable and take 
possession. Perhaps it would be 
worth a few dollars at the most, 
yet you would rejoice to get it. 
But if it were an orphan child, a 
homeless waif, created in the im- 
age of God, its spirit begotten by 
Him, and its possibilities incalcula- 
ble, would you consider it valuable, 
and be willing to give it a home? 
Let me ask you, What is the value 
of an immortal soul? 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that we have the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and I will rejoice 
more when I learn that we who 
have ability, we who have opportu- 
nity, put into effect the law of God, 
"Love your neighbor," and prove it 
by taking the orphans to our homes 
and providing for them. 
Another suggestion : There are 
' some of our people who have no 
sons to go into the mission field ; 
some whom God has blessed with 
means and ability, who live in pala- 
tial homes and have all the comforts 
of life, but they have no sons to 
bear their names in honor in the 
mission field. My brethren and 
sisters, look around you, and per- 
chance not very far from your 
doors there may be a faithful son 
of some good, noble man and wom- 
an who are unable to furnish him 
means to fill a mission. If you will 
provide the means whereby that 
man may go into the world and 
proclaim the truths of the Gospel 
of our Lord, and have his faith 
planted securely in a knowledge of 
the divinity of Jesus Christ and this 
Latter-day work, I think the means 
expended in that way will bring an 
abundant blessing to you; your 
compensation will be adequate in 
the souls brought to Christ. 



A sister said to me, not very long 
ago : "Brother Smith, I have no 
son, the Lord has not given me any 
children, but he has blessed me with 
a little means ; if you know where 
there is a faithful Latter-day Saint 
Elder who is in need, and who can 
be helped to fill his mission by a lit- 
tle .means taken from my account, 
it is your privilege to draw on me 
and help to keep him in the field 
until he is released." I felt to bless 
her, because she has a proper con- 
ception of the duties of members of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. There may be oth- 
ers who have no sons in the mission 
field, and there may be many who 
could not afford to assist to the ex- 
tent of keeping one laboring there 
to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
for the salvation of our Father's 
children, but there is another open- 
ing for missionary aid that comes 
to my mind. At Independence, Mo., 
the old and the new center stake of 
Zion, the place that God ordained 
should be a gathering place for the 
Latter-day Saints, there is a mis- 
sionary paper printed, and it goes 
to the 'people by the thousands ev- 
ery week; it is called Liahona, the 
Elders' Journal. It contains the 
truths of the Gospel, and, like the 
sacred Scriptures, it bears witness 
of the divinity of our Lord, the Re- 
deemer of the world, and also bears 
testimony of the divine mission of 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Per- 
haps you cannot send a son to the 
mission field, nor assist some other 
man's son similarly, but there are 
few of us who cannot afford to send 
the little messenger to somebody in 
the world, that truth may be dis- 
seminated thereby, and we may to 
that extent, have part in the glor- 
ious privilege that the Lord has 
given us to teach the Gospel to His

children who are in the world. I 
commend it to you, my brethren and 
sisters. You can contribute in a 
small way of your means, and you 
can have a missionary, yea, you 
can in this way have thousands of 
missionaries in the field by reason 
of your contributions, and they 
will be preaching- the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the honor and glory 
of our Father in heaven. 

I rejoice this day to be with you. 
Let us be grateful for the children 
God has blessed us with, and let us 
be grateful for the children that He 
has blessed our brethren and sis- 
ters with, and help to make them 
great and honorable men and 
women in the earth, as we desire 
our own to be. Let us be ever on 
hand to contribute of our means for 
the comfort and blessing of the 
poor, take care of those who are in 
distress, and ever be ready to min- 
ister to those who are in want, for 
the Lord has said, "Inasmuch as ye 
do it unto the least of one of these, 
my children, ye do it unto me." God 
grant that when we go back to His 
home we may hear the welcome 
plaudit: "Well done , good and 
faithful servant; you have been 
faithful in a few things, I will make 
you ruler over many things, enter 
into the joy of your Lord," is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

The Spirit of God like a fire is burning! 
The latter-day glory begins to come ' 
forth ; 

The visions and blessings of old are re- 
turning, 

And angels are coming to visit the 
earth. 

Conference was adjourned till 2 
p. m. 



o Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph E. Robinson. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. 

Conference was resumed at 2 
p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn commencing: 

O say, what is truth? Tis the fairest 
gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce; 
And priceless the value of truth will be 
when 

The proud monarch's costliest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ger- 
man E. Ellsworth. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

O ye mountains high, where the clear 
blue sky 

Arches over the vales of the free, 
Where the pure breezes blow, and the 

clear streamlets flow, 
How I've longed to your bosom to 

flee. 

EIDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 

Progress and glorious destiny of the 
Church. — Earnestness and zeal of the 
Saints and missionaries. — Divine as- 
surance that the Church will continue. 
— The Saints should rejoice, and feel 
encouraged. 

My soul has been filled with ex- 
ceeding peace during the meetings 
of this conference. I was thinking, 
while the choir was singing, how 
the truths which have been spoken, 
accompanied by the Spirit of the 
Lord which has been with us, have 
fitted into the structure of my faith 
like beautiful hewn marble into a 
temple. I have had no occasion to 
trim off the corners or to reject any 
of the material. It seems to be a

part, of my very being, and I have 
not been embarrassed by what has 
been said. I testify to the truth of 
the things which have been spoken, 
and stand prepared to defend these 
principles, knowing that they are 
eternal truth. 

As a people, and as individual 
members of the Church, we have 
reason to be very thankful to our 
Father in heaven for what He has 
done for us through the Gospel. We 
have no occasion to be discour- 
aged, but have much to encour- 
age us as individuals and as the 
people of the Church of God upon 
the earth. The Lord has fulfilled 
His promises unto us and concern- 
ing His work. Though we may 
sometimes feel that we are making 
but slow progress, the end does 
seem to me to be in sight, and the 
glorious destiny of this work is as- 
sured. True Latter-day Saints have 
no doubt in their minds in regard to 
this matter. We have seen this 
Church grow from its infancy. 
Seventy-seven and one-half years 
ago tomorrow marks the date of 
the organization of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
in the state of New York, with but 
six members. She has steadily 
grown in strength and numbers, in 
the face of great obstacles, perse- 
cution of her members, falsehoods, 
misrepresentations and vitupera- 
tions from the pulpit and from the 
press ; all of which, by the way, in- 
stead of hindering the progress of 
this work, at whose helm is God, 
the Eternal Father, has but given it 
renewed impetus. I fear when per- 
secutions cease, — when those who 
are not of us cease to raise their 
voices and to use their pens against 
this great work, — that we may be- 
come indifferent and forget our re- 
sponsibilities. I have in remem- 



brance the charge which the Savior 
gave to His Apostles in the prim- 
itive Church. We read in John, 
15th chapter : 

"Ye have not chosen me, but I have 
chosen you, and ordained you, that ye 
should go and bring forth fruit, and that 
your fruit should remain : that whatso- 
ever ye shall ask of the Father in my 
name, He may give it you. These things 
I command you, that ye love one an- 
other. If the world hate you, ye know 
that it hated me before it hated you. If 
ye were of the world, the world would 
love his own; but because ye are not of 
the world, but I have chosen you out of 
the world, therefore the world hateth 
you. Remember the word that I said 
unto you, The servant is not greater 
than his lord. If they have persecuted 
me, they will also persecute you." 

In the face of this injunction that 
the Savior gave His Apostles, that 
they be bound together in the bonds 
of love, which is stronger than the 
cords of death, warning them that 
the world would be arrayed against 
them, what may we expect but per- 
secution from the hands of those 
who are not willing to receive the 
testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ 
which we bear to the children of 
men. Persecution has followed 
this work all along the line, and this 
has helped to keep us in the path 
of our duty. The thing to be feared 
by this people, is that, when such 
exceeding peace comes in the land 
and envelops us, we. may forget the 
Lord and our religious duties. I 
realize that at the present time 
there is an era. of peace, that this 
people have liberty, such as they 
have not always enjoyed, to wor- 
ship the Lord and carry on the 
work in its various avenues ; but I 
am- pleased to note, where I have 
had experience and association with 
the Saints in the mission field, and 
in the Stakes of Zion, that they are 
not relaxing their efforts. They 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



are pressing - forward with earnest- 
ness and zeal, as if to make the best 
possible use of the time while there 
is peace ; and the spirit of inquiry 
is spreading abroad through the 
earth in relation to this people, and 
the doctrines which they teach. It 
is manifest in the mission fields, 
where presidents of missions have 
their forces better marshalled. New 
and improved policies have been 
adopted to get the Gospel before 
the people of the world. There are 
perhaps, more inquirers, more 
earnest investigators of the truth 
and doctrines of the Gospel than 
ever before in the history of this 
Church ; and I may say, with equal 
force and truth, that there are more 
converts than ever before. This 
work is making headway in the 
world, and we are increasing from 
that source as well as from within. 
As you heard this morning, from 
the figures which were presented, 
there is no people upon the face of 
the earth so prolific, none who re- 
alize so fully the importance of the 
first great commandment of our 
Father, that we multiply and re- 
plenish the earth, none so faithful 
in carrying out that and all the oth- 
er requirements which the Lord has 
laid upon us. By these means we 
are increasing in numbers, in 
strength, and in power and influ- 
ence at home in the stakes of Zion. 
As stated, we are also increasing in 
the world, and having an influence 
with the people of the world such 
as we never had before. We begin 
to comprehend what is in the fu- 
ture for Zion. We begin to realize 
that what the Lord, through His 
Prophets, has said of Zion, what she 
shall attain to in numbers, power, 
influence, and glory, will indeed be 
fulfilled. I have in mind a dream 
which was given by the Lord to 



Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, 
more than six hundred years before 
the birth of our Savior, and how 
the Lord, through that dream, and 
the interpretation which was given 
by the Prophet Daniel, showed most 
clearly the destiny of the work 
which He should commence in the 
last days. The establishment of this 
Church, its organization on the 6th 
day of April, 1830, was the begin- 
ning of the fulfilment of that most 
important prophecy. I think that 
the Lord had a purpose, a noble and 
great purpose, in giving to Nebu- 
chadnezzar that dream, and giving 
the interpretation of it, that we 
who should engage in that great 
work might receive comfort 
through it; and that it might be 
quoted by us in defense of the prin- 
ciples of righteousness, after the or- 
ganization of this Church. The 
Lord tells us, through other proph- 
ets of old, that this great work 
should be established in the latter 
days. Through Daniel, the Lord 
made known that He would set up 
a kingdom that should never be de- 
stroyed, a kingdom that should not 
be given to other people, but it 
would endure forever, and it is lik- 
ened unto a little stone cut out of 
the mountains without hands. This 
little stone was seen to roll forth 
and crush to atoms the great image 
representing the kingdoms of the 
earth ; and it was said that it should 
roll until it filled the whole earth, 
there should be no power to s*tay 
it. Inasmuch as the Gospel has 
many times been upon the earth, 
and as many times taken away be- 
cause of the wickedness of the chil- 
dren of men, it does seem important 
that the Lord should give this as- 
surance to His people of the last 
days, that no more would His 
Church be taken from the earth, or

given to another people. In this 
we have great satisfaction and en- 
couragement. Of course, the world 
does not believe that the organiza- 
tion of this Church is a fulfilment 
of that prophecy. Neither will they^ 
regard the restoration of the Gos- 
pel, through the angel Moroni, as 
a fulfilment of the prediction of 
John, on the Isle of Patmos, re- 
corded in the 14th chapter of Reve- 
lations; when he looked down 
through the vista of time unto the 
last days, in reference to which he 
said : 

"And I saw another angel fly in the 
midst of heaven, having the everlast- 
ing gospel to preach unto them that 
dwell on the earth, and to every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and people, 
saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and 
give glory to Him ; for the hour of His 
judgment is come, and worship Him 
that made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea, and the fountains of waters." 

No, the world does not accept 
that; but what a joy and satisfac- 
tion it is to the Latter-day Saints 
to know that the restoration of the 
Gospel is a fulfilment of that 
prophecy, to know that the Gospel 
did come in the way that the Lord, 
by the mouth of His servants, pre- 
dicted and said that it would come. 
What a joy and satisfaction! We 
cannot expect the people of the 
world who reject the simple doc- 
trines of the Gospel, which were 
enunciated by the Son of God Him- 
self, to accept these prophecies, and 
their fulfilment in the restoration of 
the Gospel, and the organization of 
the Church in these last days. No, 
but the Latter-day Saints have oc- 
casion to be thankful, and to be en- 
couraged because of what the Lord 
has given us — seventy-seven and a 
half years of growth ; and what a 
mighty people we have become ! 



I have in my pocket a clipping 
from the Deseret News of April 
20th last, which I wish to read to 
you. It bears upon this subject, 
and represents the truth as it is seen 
abroad : 

"mormons now eighth. 

r 'A Christian Cynosure estimate of the 
growth and expansion of Mormonism 
will prove decidedly interesting if not 
instructive reading at this time, to 
many people both within and without 
the Church. It is a well known fact 
that its membership is increasing in 
goodly number and that 'the little stone 
that was cut out of the mountains with- 
out hands' is rolling rapidly forward to 
fulfill the destiny that the Almighty has 
marked out for it. And the destiny will 
be reached as surely as the world moves 
or the sun shines. 

"To those members of the Church, 
if any such there be, who have grown 
impatient at the thought, that it was 
not going forward at as high a rate of 
speed as they in their well-meaning zeal 
might desire, it is meet that they should 
remember that seventy-seven years have 
barely passed since its restoration to 
earth. To take eighth place among the 
churches of America, from the numeri- 
cal standpoint, in an even threee-quar- 
ters of a century, with the tremendous 
obstacles it has had to meet, is in our 
opinion, altogether a remarkable show- 
ing. If it shall but continue its present 
ratio of membership increase it will have 
moved up to a very commanding posi- 
tion by the time its first centennary shall 
be celebrated in 1930. Its virility, 
strength and cohesion are the wonder of 
thinking men and women through the 
world. Soon they will learn that it is 
an American Church in all that the term 
implies. And when that great truth shall 
be comprehended we may expect to see 
a growth that will startle the wise of the 
earth. 

"Apropos of our opening reference to 
the Christian Cynosure, which is pub- 
lished in Chicago, we call attention to 
the fact that it bases its statement upon 
the written report of the chief authority 
on that subject in the country, and that 
his comparisons prove Latter-day Saint 
growth to be far in excess of that of any 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other religious organization. Its words 
are : 

" 'The Mormons, figures of the United 
States government offices show, are 
growing very rapidly. The report of Car- 
roll D. Wright, United State Commis- 
sioner, shows that they have increased in 
number during the last sixteen years 
138 per cent. That is to say, they have 
been doubling their number every twelve 
years. There were 166,125 in 1890. 
There were 396,354 in 1906. No one 
other religious body has increased as 
largely within the same period. Thev 
now rank eighth in numbers among the 
denominations in the United States.' " 

I believe this to be a reliable re- 
port, and we may congratulate our- 
selves, as Latter-day Saints, that we 
are identified with the most Chris- 
tianized Church in America, a 
Church which is destined to be ac- 
knowledged as the most American- 
ized Church in America. Why 
not? We have the principles of 
eternal truth, we have the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we 
teach it as He and His Apostles 
taught it. We have the organiza- 
tion with- all the officers as they ex- 
isted in the primitive Church. We 
have the authority to preach this 
Gospel, and minister in its ordi- 
nances, for the salvation of the hu- 
man family. We are here upon the 
land of Zion — America. Why 
should not the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints be re- 
garded as the most Americanized 
church in the land? Such is its 
destiny. 

Are there any of us discouraged? 
Would any of us retrace our steps ? 
Do we desire to go back to the un- 
reliable faith that we had before the 
light of the Gospel came into our 
souls? No, verily. Of those who 
have undertaken to walk the nar- 
row way, up a hilly and thorny 
path, beset with obstacles of various 



kinds, only those have become dis- 
couraged who have not the power 
to deny themselves those things 
which are in conflict with the teach- 
ings of the Gospel, those people 
who will not accept that which 
makes men and women Christ-like 
and prepares them to go into the 
presence of our Father. Those who 
become discouraged and forsake 
this work are usually those who 
have gratified their passions and 
desires, until they have lost all the 
spirituality that was in their souls, 
and they have no ambition to press 
on to the goal of glory. Those who 
have been true and faithful will lay 
down their lives rather than forfeit 
these principles, or relinquish the 
hope they have of obtaining eternal 
life. The Lord has planted in our 
hearts a testimony; yea, many tes- 
timonies, of the divine origin of 
this work and of its saving powers, 
and we doubt not, but we speak of 
those things of which we know. It 
is my testimony to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, and friends every- 
where, that God does lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God, that the 
Gospel has been restored, and we 
have it to give to you — yea, those 
who have authority have it to give 
freely to all mankind who, with 
broken hearts and contrite spirits, 
with faith in God, prepare them- 
selves to receive its ordinances and 
to live its laws. 

God bless you, one and all ; may 
we be kept from all evil, that the 
Spirit of God may dwell in us, that 
we may see the beauties of the Gos- 
pel, that we may appreciate these 
blessings, and through faithfulness 
and obedience obtain eternal life in 
the end, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 

Reply to Bishop Spalding. — Calumny 
the cause, persecution the effect. — 
Marcus Aurelius and the Christians. — 
Charges against the Former-day 
Saints and the Latter-day Saints com- 
pared and refuted. 

I trust that while I speak to you 
this afternoon I shall be aided by 
the same spirit of wisdom and in- 
telligence that has inspired the ut- 
terances of the speakers who have 
already addressed the conference. 

When I gaze upon this immense 
congregation — a Saturday congre- 
gation — and realize that it is only a 
part — perhaps about half the num- 
bers of the Latter-day Saints who 
have gathered to their central city 
for the purpose of attending con- 
ference, I am reminded of the 
words of the hymn, "Zion is grow- 
ing." The only thing that mars 
my peace in relation to the matter 
is the information given by the city 
press, that some of our brethren 
and sisters are walking the streets, 
unable to secure accommodations, 
even by paying for them, on ac- 
count of the crowded condition that 
prevails. I heartily commend the 
appointment and the labors of the 
committee whose duty it is to see 
that this situation is relieved, and 
hope that none of our visitors, and 
especially those who have entertain- 
ed many of us at their homes, may 
be without food or shelter, through 
any laxity on our part. 

I once heard of a public speaker, 
who was about to address an as- 
semblage of a mixed character, and 
was cautioned by the chairman not 
to speak upon a certain subject, be- 
cause it would offend a portion of 
the audience, — the Methodists. 
"Very well," said the speaker, "I 
will dwell upon such and such a 



theme." "No, that will never do," 
said the chairman, "that would be 
distasteful to the Presbyterians." 
"Then suppose I say such and such 
things." "No, no, that will not do, 
either — it might give umbrage to 
the Catholics." "Well, then," asked 
the bewildered orator, "what can I 
say? Whom shall I talk about?" 
"I have it," exclaimed the chair- 
man; "pitch into the Mormons; 
they haven't got a friend in town." 
I do not think any Latter-day Saint 
can say or feel, at this time, that he 
tiasn't a- friend in town. The town 
is filled with them from near and 
far. But let none of our brethren 
and sisters be even tempted to be- 
lieve that they are without friends 
in Salt Lake City. 

I am now going to read you a 
selection from a sermon, delivered, 
so the papers say, at St. Mark's Ca- 
thedral, in this city, on Sunday 
morning, September 22, 1907. The 
speaker was Bishop F. S. Spaldinp. 
and his subject was "The Kingdom 
of Heaven." I wish, in the begin- 
ning, to commend him for one 
thing; he did not deem it necessary 
to "pitch into the Mormons" alone ; 
for while he passed some strictures 
upon us, he also remembered the 
Methodists, the Christian Scientists, 
and the Seventh Day Adventists ; 
but he was most severe upon the 
Latter-day Saints. He said, in part: 

"President Andrew D. White, in the 
introduction to his work on the "War- 
fare of Science and Theology,' affirms 
his most sincere respect, yes, his most 
reverent belief in the Christian religion; 
but he has no word strong enough to 
express his dislike of Christian the- 
ology." 

I understand the difference be- 
tween religion and theology to be 
this — religion is the practice, and 
theology the statement of the doc- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



trine. Bishop Spalding goes on to 
say : 

"This point of view is that of a large 
number of thoughtful men. The new 
psychology has given its testimony to 
the reality of religious experience. All 
men have a feeling of moral unrest, 
which they instinctively feel can alone 
be quieted by making proper connection 
with the higher powers, is the report of 
the most prominent investigator. And 
surely this is good news. It tells us 
that all men are religious; that even in 
the breast of the most brutal, the most 
worldly, there is the germ of that high 
instinct which binds the creature to his 
Creator ! 

"But here comes the necessity of a 
word of caution, for this religious fac- 
ulty drives men into excess, it makes 
them overlap reason and even morality. 
To the Seventh Day Adventist it pre- 
sents a petty matter of time as a funda- 
mental of the faith. To the Mormon, it 
justifies, nay, requires, a social system 
which strikes death to the center of all 
social progress, the purity of the fam- 
ily." 

I do not know Bishop Spalding, 
and I do not know that he knows 
me ; but I do know that he does not 
understand the Latter-day Saints, 
and does not comprehend their re- 
ligion. Either this, or he has made 
a most woeful mistake, in saying, 
consciously, that which is not true 
concerning them. I feel a personal 
regret in this matter, because in 
times past I have sustained friendly 
relations with some of the Episco- 
pal bishops. I remember with re- 
spect that "grand old man," Bishop 
Tuttle, who presided over a dio- 
cese comprising Utah, and other 
western parts, for many years. He 
was an upright and honorable man, 
and never, to my knowledge, did he 
utter one word of unkindness to- 
wards the Mormon people. I do not 
know that he ever attacked in any 
way our- religion. He had a big 
heart and a kindly soul, and he won 



the love of the people among whom 
he labored. I was also friendly with 
his successor, the late Bishop Abiel 
Leonard, and in conversing with 
him on a certain occasion I com- 
mended the spirit and conduct of 
the Episcopal bishops, so far as my 
acquaintance extended, and spoke 
particularly of the liberality of 
Bishop Tuttle. Bishop Leonard re- 
plied, "That is a characteristic of 
our bishops; they are liberal, they 
are charitable to all." Hence, it is 
with a feeling of regret, such as one 
might have in seeing an idol shat- 
tered, that I contemplate the un- 
friendly utterance of Bishop Spald- 
ing. 

But my personal feelings are of 
very little moment, compared with 
weightier considerations that arise. 
I want to show you some of the 
more serious effects of utterances 
of this kind, and I will now read to 
you a dispatch taken from the Des- 
eret News of last evening, the head- 
lines of which are as follows : "El- 
ders expelled from Germany." 
"Their offense, spreading the Gos- 
pel, conducting baptisms and mak- 
ing converts." "Their names are 
not given." "They were arrested 
and summarily taken under guard 
to the frontier." "Thousands of na- 
tive members of the Church have 
been subjected to various police 
hindrances." And then follows the 
dispatch : 

"Dresden, Saxony, Oct. 4. Three 
American Mormons have been expelled 
from Germany, as the result of persist- 
ing, despite final warnings prohibiting 
them from spreading the propaganda, in 
conducting river baptisms and making 
converts. They were arrested and sum- 
marily taken under guard to the frontier. 
The Imperial authorities decided in 1903, 
that it was not desirable to allow. Mor- 
mon agents to continue their activity in 
Germany; but, owing to the representa- 
tions of the American embassy in Ber- 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



47 



lin, and Chief Missionary Cannon, 
whose field of activity was Central Eu- 
rope, with headquarters at Berlin, the 
foreign office allowed the Mormons a 
month in which to settle their affairs and 
leave the country. There were at that 
time fifty or more missionaries' in the 
various states in Germany, and the 
grounds for their expulsion were teach- 
ings contrary to public morality. 

"It was also agreed with Mr. Cannon 
that all the Mormons who were Amer- 
ican citizens should discontinue present- 
ing their doctrine in Germany. The 
German converts, of whom there were 
thousands, and who continued to follow 
their faith under native pastors, were 
subjected to various police hindrances. 
Mr. Cannon moved his central European 
headquarters to Switzerland, and it is 
understood, has since returned to Salt 
Lake. 

"It is now presumed his successor is 
re-entering the German field for Mor- 
mon missionary work from which for- 
merly many women converts were sent 
to Utah." 

I place these two newspaper re-, 
ports side by side — the sermon of 
Bishop Spalding; on one hand, and 
the expulsion of our Elders from 
Germany on the other ; and I say 
that they sustain to each other the 
relation of cause and effect. Not 
these particular instances, perhaps, 
but the classes of events to which 
they respectively belong;, represent 
that mutual relation. 

We do not marvel that partisan 
newspapers, having; political ends 
to subserve, make a business of 
misrepresenting; the majority of 
the people of Utah. We are used 
to such things. We do not expect 
anything else from newspapers of 
that class. But surely we have the 
right to expect better treatment 
from men who profess to be fol- 
lowers of the Son of God, and who 
call themselves bishops of the Chris- 
tian church. Men who claim to be 
shepherds over the flock of Christ, 
and whose mission is the salvation 



of souls, have no right to foment 
mobocracy and murder, or cause 
the expulsion of unoffending mis- 
sionaries from the nations. 

Perhaps you think my language 
rather lurid when I speak of mur- 
der, as one of the possible conse- 
quences in such cases. I want you 
to understand that I am speaking 
by the record. Not in one instance, 
nor in two or three only, but in 
many, have the falsehoods gener- 
ated in Utah and scattered broad- 
cast over this nation and over the 
world, resulted, not only in perse- 
cutions of a petty character, but in 
the murder of innocent men, in the 
shedding of blameless blood, that 
will rise to judgment against those 
responsible for the fulmination of 
such calumnies. 

And yet these things, grievous as 
they are, do not much astonish the 
Latter-day Saints. Mormonism, if 
it tells the truth concerning itself, 
is the religion of Jesus Christ, and 
this is the dispensation of the ful- 
ness of times, when God has re- 
stored, by the ministry of holy an- 
gels, that ancient gospel, which was 
framed in the heavens before the 
world was created, as the means 
of man's salvation ; and it has been 
revealed to man, in a series of dis- 
pensations, reaching from the days 
of Adam down to the present time. 
It is the same religion that Jesus 
introduced and died for ; the same 
that His Apostles preached under 
His direction, and for which they 
laid down their lives. It has come 
back to the earth, with the same 
promises and the same powers that 
characterized it anciently, including 
trie promise that "all who live godly 
in Christ Jesus shall suffer perse- 
cution." Therefore we are not 
much surprised (though we may be 
made to grieve) that the Latter-day 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Saints should have inherited, as a 
legacy from the past, similar perse- 
cutions to those suffered by the 
Saints of former times. 

And now I desire to read another 
selection, showing- the experiences 
of some of the early Christians dur- 
ing- the days of the Roman empire. 
The book I have before me is a vol- 
ume of the "Beacon Lights of His- 
tory," by the late Dr. John Lord, 
who, in his lecture on Marcus Au- 
relius and the Glory of Rome, says : 

"The only stains on the reign of this 
good and great emperor — for there were 
none on his character — were in allowing 
the elevation of his son Commodus as 
his successor, and his persecution of the 
Christians. It would have been wise for 
Aurelius to have selected one of the 
ablest of his generals, or one of the 
wisest of his senators, as Hadrian did, 
for so great and responsible a position, 
rather than a wicked, cruel, dissolute 
son. * * * * For five reigns the 
empire had enjoyed peace and prosper- 
ity. For five reigns the tide of corrup- 
tion had been stayed ; but the flood of 
corruption swept all barriers away with 
the accession of Commodus, and from 
that day the decline of the empire was 
rapid and fatal. Still, probably nothing 
could have long arrested ruin. The em- 
pire was doomed. 

"The other fact which obscured the 
glory of Marcus Aurelius as a sovereign, 
was his persecution of the Christians,— 
for which it is hard to account, when the 
beneficent character of the emperor is 
considered. His reign was signalized for 
an imperial persecution, in which Justin 
at Rome, Polycarp at Smyrna, and Pon- 
thinus at Lyons, suffered martyrdom. 
It was not the first persecution. Under 
Nero the Christians had been cruelly 
tortured, nor did the virtuous Trajan 
change the policy of the government. 
Had rian and Antoninus Pius permitted 
the laws to be enforced against the 
Christians, and Marcus Aurelius saw np 
reason to alter them. .But to the mind 
of the Stoic on the throne, says Arnold, 
the Christians were 'philosophically con- 
temptible, politically subversive, and 
morally abominable.' They were re- 
garded as statesmen looked upon the 



Jesuits in the reign of Louis XV, as we 
look upon the Mormons, — as dangerous 
to free institutions. Moreover, the 
Christians were everywhere misunder- 
stood and misrepresented. It was im- 
possible for Marcus Aurelius to see the 
Christians except through a mist of pre- 
judices. 'Christianity grew up in the 
Catacombs, not on the Palatine.' In al- 
lowing the laws to take their course 
against a body of men who were regard- 
ed with distrust and aversion, as ene- 
mies of the state, the emperor was sim- 
ply unfortunate. So wise and good a 
man, perhaps, ought to have known the 
Christians better; but, not knowing 
them, he cannot be stigmatized as a cruel 
man." 

This, as you will observe, is in 
the nature of an apology for the 
emperor who, good and great 
though he was in many respects, 
failed for some reason to acquaint 
himself with the true character of 
the people called Christians, who 
. were everywhere spoken evil 
against; and he therefore allowed 
matters to drift — allowed the laws 
enacted against an innocent people 
by his wicked predecessors to be 
enforced; and thus came the stain 
upon his administration which our 
author justly deplores. Marcus 
Aurelius knew no more about the 
true character of the Christians and 
their religion, than Bishop Spalding 
seems to know about the Latter- 
day Saints and their faith ; and this 
is the most charitable construction 
that can be put upon his act. But 
why did not the Roman emperor 
make himself acquainted with the 
people whom his officers were cru- 
elly persecuting, even unto death? 
Why do not our modern Christian 
ministers, if they desire to tell the 
truth about the Latter-day Saints, 
acquire correct information con- 
cerning them before committing 
themselves to reckless statements 
like the one I have quoted? There

is some excuse for men in the far 
east, or west, who read nothing - but 
libelous newspapers that misrepre- 
sent the Mormon people, or^ who 
have heard nothing but the scanda- 
lous and false stories that are the 
stock in trade of most of the min- 
isters of Christendom in relation to 
Mormonism — there is some excuse 
for these men, who stand off at .a 
distance and pelt us with stones ; 
but what excuse can be offered for 
those who will take up their abode 
in the very midst of this people, 
mingling with their Mormon neigh- 
bors, meeting them every day upon 
the street, or in public halls, and 
even visiting them in their homes, 
having every means of acquainting 
themselves with their lives and 
characters, and who will then re- 
vamp the old, stale, worn out stories 
and cant phrases, brought with 
them, perchance, from the hot-beds 
of anti-Mormonism abroad? You 
would think that fair and honorable 
men, who had formed incorrect the- 
ories regarding the Mormons, when 
confronted with the facts, would 
abandon their theories, or modify 
them in order to be in harmony with 
the truth. But no, rather than do 
that, there are some who would 
bend and distort the facts, and try 
to make them conform to their false 
notions and preconceptions. I do 
not know whether Bishop Spalding 
is a man of that kind or not. But 
either he did or did not know what 
he was talking about, when he made 
the statement that the religion of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints "justifies and re- 
quires a social system that strikes 
death to the center of all social pro- 
gress, the purity of the family." 

The charges preferred against 
the Latter-day Saints are precisely 
the charges that were urged against 



the early Christians, who, as our 
author truly says, "were every- 
where misunderstood and misrep- 
resented." The Christians were re- 
garded as "philosophically con- 
temptible, politically subversive and 
morally abominable;" and this is 
the substance of the indictment 
brought against the Saints of latter- 
days. I propose to answer these 
charges seriatim : 

First, — let me ask, what is meant 
by philosophy? The great Emer- 
son, himself a philosopher, says : 
"Philosophy is the account which 
the human mind gives to itself of 
the constitution of the world." If 
you will consult your dictionaries, 
you will find that philosophy also 
means the search for fundamental 
truth, and the philosopher is there- 
fore a 1 seeker after fundamental 
truth. Measured by this standard, 
Mormonism admirably answers the 
description. That is just what we 
hold it to be, — fundamental truth; 
and Joseph Smith answers the de- 
scription of a philosopher, a seeker 
after fundamental truth. He was 
disgusted — long before Andrew D. 
White's day — with the unphiloso- 
phical theology of the churches of 
Christendom. He was confronted 
by those old traditions, musty with 
the ages, which had come down to 
modern times, demanding that men 
believe in a God who is one and 37 ;t 
three, three and yet one, defining 
Him as merely a spirit, impersonal, 
incomprehensible, without body, 
parts or passions, and declaring 
that he made man and woman, and 
the earth, and all that it contains, 
out of nothing, and made them to 
save half of them, and damn the 
other half, regardless of their mer- 
its. This was the God of the Chris- 
tian world, which was all split up 
into fragments, its sects contending 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with each other, and in conflict with 
each other's claims. Joseph Smith, 
a reader of the Bible, a seeker after 
fundamental truth, desired to know 
which of all these contending 
churches was the true church of 
Christ. He was philosophic enough 
to determine for himself that they 
could not all be true, that God was 
not the author of confusion, and he 
made his first oral prayer to Deity 
in an attempt to learn which church 
and which religion were the church 
and religion of Christ. The Lord 
answered his prayer, and gave him 
more than he asked. He had only 
sought to know which of all the 
churches was the true one, and was 
told to his surprise that the true 
Church was not then upon the 
earth. God came to him in person, 
with His Son Jesus Christ, and for- 
ever shattered the false notion that 
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are 
one in person, and that God is only 
a spirit, an atmosphere or essence, 
filling the immensity of space, an 
immaterial influence, that 

"Warms in the sun, refreshes in the 
breeze, 

Glows in the stars and blossoms in the 

trees ; 

Lives through all life, extends through 

a!) extent, 
Spreads undivided, operates unspent." 

Joseph Smith said, "I saw two 
glorious personages — the Father 
and the Son. They were in the 
form of man, and they spoke to 
me." That was the greater part of 
the revelation embodied in Joseph's 
first vision; for it restored the lost 
knowledge of the true God, after 
which the world, with its vain 
philosophies, had been groping for 
ages. It revealed anew the sub- 
lime fact that man is verily the 
child of Deity, and can become, by 



development, like unto his Father 
and his God. It taught the great 
truth that man is divinity in em- 
bryo, and capable, by education, 
through human experience, and by 
obedience to the principles of eter- 
nal progress, of rising to the plane 
whereon stands the Universal 
Father, who desires to make His 
children equal with Himself, and to 
put into their possession all things. 
What is there unphilosophic about 
it? What is there contemptible 
about it? What is there unreason- 
able about it? You earthly parents 
expect your children to become 
men and women like yourselves. 
You know that it is only a ques- 
tion of time, when, if they live, your 
little toddling children will become 
men and women, and will marry 
and have children of their own. 
Why, then, should it be deemed un- 
philosophic for man, the child of 
God, — man and woman, male and 
female, — to become like their Fath- 
er and their Mother in heaven ? We 
are at the defiance of the world to 
prove this doctrine unphilosophical. 

Our system "strikes death to the 
center of all social progress," does 
it? Why, the Gospel in which we 
believe was instituted for man's 
eternal progress. Joseph Smith de- 
clared that God, in the beginning, 
finding Himself in the midst of 
spirits and glory, because He was 
more intelligent, saw proper to in- 
stitute laws whereby the rest might 
advance like Flimself. That is the 
purpose of the Gospel, the system 
now called Mormonism. It stands 
for progress, through time and in 
all eternity. Unphilosophic, is it? 
Let us see. Emerson says- again: 
"Plato is philosophy, and philos- 
ophy Plato, at once the glory 
and the shame of mankind, since 
neither Saxon nor Roman have 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



51 



availed to add any idea to his cate- 
gories. No wife, no children, had 
he, and the thinkers of all civilized 
nations are his posterity, and are 
tinged with his mind." Now, what 
does Plato say regarding- the origin 
of all things ? To the study of na- 
ture he prefixes this dogma : "Let 
us declare the cause which led the 
Supreme Ordainer to produce and 
compose the universe. He was 
good, and he who is good has no 
kind of envy. Exempt from envy, 
he wished that all things should be 
as much as possible like himself. 
Whosoever, taught by wise men, 
shall admit this as the prime cause 
of the origin and foundation of the 
world, will be in the truth." So 
says Plato. Note the similarity in 
the thought of the Greek philosoph- 
er, and the thought of the Ameri- 
can prophet. Plato says that the 
Supreme Ordainer wished that all 
things should be as much as possi- 
ble like himself, and therefore He 
produced and composed the uni- 
verse ; Joseph declares that God, in 
the beginning, surrounded with 
spirits and glory, saw proper to in- 
stitute laws whereby the rest might 
have a privilege to advance like 
Himself. 

But perhaps you think Joseph 
Smith was a plagiarist, that he was 
merely echoing the thought of the 
ancient philosopher. Not so. Jos- 
eph Smith was not acquainted with 
Plato. We have no evidence that 
he had ever read the writings of 
that great thinker. But Joseph rec- 
oginzed that the source of all truth 
is one, as the source of all life is 
one; and that even as the light, 
which illumines the day and the 
night proceeds from the sun, so all 
truth, by whomsoever received, at 
any time, proceeds from that God 
who is the personification of eternal 



truth. Joseph was no more a plag- 
iarist of Plato, than Jesus was a 
plagiarist of Confucius, who declar- 
ed in a negative way the principle 
of the Golden Rule, two or three 
centuries before Jesus affirmed it. 
All we can say of such things is 
that our heavenly Father gave to 
Confucius, the Chinese sage, a 
glinting of the same light that dwelt 
in His son Jesus Christ, in whom 
was "the fulness of the Godhead 
bodily." In like manner, the same 
Being who inspired Plato the Greek, 
chose Joseph Smith the American 
as His prophet — the prophet of the 
last dispensation, and revealed to 
him anew the eternal, fundamental 
truth, the heritage of all the ages. 

The Christians, in the next place, 
were regarded as "politically sub- 
versive ;" that is, they were accused 
of designing the overthrow of the 
State. Their great Apostle, Paul, 
had declared that the "powers that 
be are ordained of God; wherefore 
let every man be subject to the pow- 
ers that be, until He comes whose 
right it is to reign." But this did 
not avail them. They were still 
"disloyal," still "enemies of the 
State." Though innocent, they 
could easily be slandered, and when 
a cruel Roman ruler, anxious to 
cover up his crimes, to divert from 
himself public censure, accused the 
Christians of burning Rome, and of 
seeking to undermine the empire, 
his word was taken, the plea of the 
innocent was set at naught, and 
they were murdered by hundreds 
and by thousands. They were 
burned as torches in the gardens of 
the Roman emperor; they were 
flung to wild beasts in the arena; 
they were stoned to death; they 
were dragged at the tails of wild, 
horses until life was extinct. They 
were "enemies of the State," be- 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



.cause, forsooth, a monster named 
Nero had so declared, and he was 
the emperor of Rome, sitting- on 
the summit of political power. But 
the charge against the Christians 
was as false as the hell in which 
it had its origin, a hell that will 
receive into its fiery embrace those 
who put to death the Saints of 
God in all ages. It was a wicked 
lie. And the charge made today, 
that the Latter-day Saints are en- 
emies of the State, that they seek to 
undermine society, that they are dis- 
loyal, treasonable, rebellious, and 
that they plot for the overthrow of 
free institutions, — this also is a lie, 
a lie so black, so infamous, that no 
language is capable of characteriz- 
ing it. Our religion is against ev- 
erything in the nature of treason, 
disloyalty, anarchy or rebellion. The 
Gospel we preach is ''the perfect 
law of liberty." Joseph the Prophet, 
in the Articles of Faith, accepted 
by this people as their rule of guid- 
ance, emphasizes 'Paul's teaching, 
and enjoins upon us to be subject 
to the powers that be, until Pie 
comes whose right it is to reign. I 
could, if there were time, quote 
from the Book of Mormon, from 
the Doctrine & Covenants, from all 
the revelations to Joseph Smith, 
enough to make a volume, in sup- 
port of the assertion that the Mor- 
mon people are the friends of law 
and order, friends of the Flag, and 
of the Constitution of the United 
States, which they deem heaven-in- 
spired. I could cite many of the 
sayings of the Prophet (who was 
accused of trying to make himself a 
king, but whose last and crowning 
act was an endeavor to become the 
President of the United States,) to 
show that he desired the glory of 
his country, the extension of the 
Union ; that he was a true and loyal 



American, one who loved American 
institutions, and predicted a day to 
come when the Latter-day Saints 
would save their nation, at a time 
when treason and anarchy would 
be plotting against and aiming at 
its life. But time will not permit, 
neither is it necessary. 

Let us come to the third count of 
the indictment. It was said that 
the Christians were "morally abom- 
inable." lust as .now it is alleged 
that the Latter-day Saints justify 
and even require "a social system 
that strikes death to the center ci" 
all social progress, the purity of the 
family." Because of such false 
charges, made by men of character 
and prominence, our missionaries 
are hindered in their sacred work, 
and expelled from the confines of 
the nations, their fields of labor. 
The world has been made to be- 
lieve that we are a corrupt people, 
and that we send our emissaries 
forth for the sole purpose of con- 
verting women and dragging them 
down to degradation. The truth is, 
that the Elders are sent to preach 
the Gospel — faith, repentance, bap- 
tism, and the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. They put forth no special 
effort for the conversion of women. 
If more women than men have join- 
ed the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, — though that is 
a question ; but even if it be true, it 
is only because women are .naturally 
more religjious than men — better 
than men, purer than men ; and be- 
ing purer, they are more suscep- 
tible to spiritual influences,' the in- 
spirations that come from heaven; 
and this is the reason why more of 
them are converted. The Gospel is 
preached not to any one class, but 
to all classes, and to both sexes, and 
the Elders are under obligations to 
baptize all converted souls who

53 



come unto them, except certain 
one s— and who are they? Women 
whose husbands, and children 
whose parents, object to their bap- 
tism into the Church. These are 
among the strict instructions given 
to our missionaries ; not to baptize 
any married woman- without the 
consent of her husband, nor any 
unmarried girl, under age, without 
the consent of her parents. If hus- 
bands or parents object, theirs must 
be the responsibility. It is not true 
that the teachings of our mission- 
aries are against public morality, 
or private morality. It is a false- 
hood, and it had its origin here in 
Salt Lake City, in the utterances 
of such men as the Episcopal bishop 
whom I have quoted, and in the Cul- 
minations of a political and partisan 
press, bent on the accomplishment 
of certain selfish ends. 

"Purity of the family," indeed! 
I know something about Mormon 
families. I have not lived fifty 
years in this community for noth- 
ing. My father was the head of a 
Mormon household, and I know 
.whereof I speak, when I tell you 
that he was a pure and a noble man, 
who taught his family to be honest, 
truthful, and virtuous. His wives, 
my mother and my other mother, 
the second wife, taught their chil- 
dren the same principles, and both 
were good, pure, honorable and vir- 
tuous women; and the family life 
was pure. I mention my father's 
family because I know it better 
than any other. It is but an in- 
stance, however, a sample of hun- 
dreds and thousands of the families 
of this people. What about the 
family of President Smith? He 
said, at Washington, that he was 
proud of his family and of every 
one of his children. He is not alone 
in that pride. It is an honest pride. 



We are all proud of the family of 
President Joseph F. Smith; they 
are exceptionally moral and clean; 
not a black sheep in the flock ; pure- 
minded, honest, virtuous boys and 
girls, worthy of their noble father 
and of their pure and noble moth- 
ers. We join with the President in 
saying, we are proud of every one 
of his children, and will be, so long 
as they follow in the footsteps of 
their faithful parents, so long as 
they serve God and keep His com- 
mandments, and remain as pure and 
virtuous as they are today. And 
his family does not stand alone. 
There are others. The families of 
President Brigham Young, Heber 
C. Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, Wil- 
ford Woodruff, John Taylor,George 
A. Smith, the Grants, the Pratts, 
the Snows, the Richardses, the 
Cannons, and hundreds of others 
might be named. Here and there 
a black sheep, it is true. But have 
Christian families none such? Are 
the Gentile families without spot 
or blemish, that they can cast the 
first stone? The great majority of 
the grown children of Mormon par- 
ents, even those born and reared in 
the midst of so-called polygamous 
influences, are exemplary men and 
women. They were taught from 
their mother's knee that next to the 
crime of murder is the sin of un- 
chastity. There are family prayers, 
morning and night, in these house- 
holds ; they are a church-going peo- 
ple ; they serve God, mind their own 
business, and make sacrifices at 
home and abroad for the preaching 
of the Gospel and the conversion of 
souls to the truth. You cannot tell 
me anything about "the purity of 
the family" in the midst of Mor- 
mondom. 

I hope Bishop Spalding did not 
know that he was misrepresenting 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us. If he did know it, I hope that 
he and his class will repent, lest, 
perchance, through their misrepre- 
sentations, innocent blood may be 
found upon their skirts at the Day 
of Judgment. If God judges this 
world — and He says He will — upon 
the principle of "whatsoever ye do 
unto My servants ye do unto Me," 
then beware! "Touch not Mine 
anointed,do My prophets no harm " 
If you should cause the death of a 
servant of God in the discharge of 
his duty, better, far better, that a 
millstone were hung about your 
neck and you be cast into the depths 
of the sea ! If the bishop did know, 
and purposely misstated the char- 
acter and spirit of the Mormon peo^ 
pie, let me in all charity commend 
to him those words of the wise 
Solomon: "These six things doth 
the Lord hate, yea, seven are an 
abomination unto Him: a proud 



look, a lying tongue, and hands that 
shed innocent blood, a heart that 
deviseth wicked imaginations, feet 
that be swift in running to mis- 
chief, a false witness that speaketh 
lies, and him that soweth discord 
among brethren." But if he did not 
know what he was talking about, 
then I respectfully commend to him 
those other sayings of the sapient 
man of old : "With all thy getting, 
get understanding," "He that judg- 
eth a matter before he heareth it, 
is not wise." Amen. 

Elder Elihu Call effectively sang 
the tenor Solo, "Abide with me." 

The choir and congregation sang 
"The Doxology." 

Conference was adjourned until 
Sunday, Oct. 6th, at 10 a. m. 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Joseph A. McRae. 



THIRD DAY. 



Sunday, Oct. 6th, 10 a. m. 

Conference was called to order 
by President Joseph F. Smith, and 
he announced that, as the Taber- 
nacle could not accommodate all 
who desired to be admitted, an 
overflow meeting would be held this 
morning in the Assembly Hall, un- 
der direction of Elder George F. 
Richards. 

The choir and congregation sang 
the hymn : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion ; 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 
will come. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Ne- 
phi Pratt. 

The choir sang the chorus, 
"Rouse oh ye mortals, the dawn is 
near."

Medical fakirs, and other traveling 
quacks. — Serious danger in use of pat- 
ent medicines. — Denunciation of spec- 
ulation and debt.— Prevailing indiffer- 
ence concerning religion. — Apprecia- 
tion of parents, wives and husbands. 

I had hoped that someone else 
would be called upon this morning 
to speak at the opening of this 
meeting. On account of my hav- 
ing been absent the two days pre- 
vious, I felt that I would like to 
hear at least one of the brethren 
speak, so that I could get the spirit 



of the conference. I shall claim an 
interest in the prayer that was of- 
fered by Elder Pratt, that the same 
spirit may influence the speakers to- 
day that directed them in the meet- 
ings held before. 

In these general conferences we 
gather from all parts to sustain the 
authorities of the Church, to re- 
ceive instruction, counsel, and ad- 
monition, to speak of God's good- 
ness and mercy unto us, and testify 
of the restoration of the Gospel rf 
Jesus Christ. While traveling 
through the stakes of Zion we 
sometimes see errors and wrongs 
that exist among the people, and we 
try to call attention to them in the 
spirit of counsel, and by way of 
advice — not in a spirit of fault-find- 
ing, but for the purpose of better- 
ing the condition of the people as 
a whole. I have not had time to 
read the papers giving a synopsis 
of remarks made by the brethren, 
but I do feel, this morning, like 
calling attention to some things 
needing correction that I have no- 
ticed, concerning which it would, 
perhaps, be proper to counsel you 
who are present, and through you 
other members of the Church, to 
see that in the future there is a 
change made respecting the points 
I may mention. 

I want to speak, for a short time, 
upon fakes and fakirs. I am led to 
speak on this line because of the 
fact that, not long ago, in one of 
the counties adjoining this, in a 
town inhabited almost entirely by 
Latter-day Saints, there came in 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the midst of the people — heralded 
by newspapers — a man claiming 
that he was the greatest doctor in 
the world. He was a phenomenon. 
He had such great wisdom that he 
could cure all the ills that mankind 
is heir to. He was well dressed 
and looked like a gentleman. One 
t>f the first things he did on arriv- 
ing in the town was to hire the brass 
band, for the purpose of drawing a 
crowd and preceding his carriage 
to all meetings. He went to one of 
the business corners of the city, 
where a little stand was erected, 
and in order to hold the crowd until 
he could convince some of them 
that they had worms, or something 
worse, he had three or four niggers 
sing songs — by the way, I have 
been told that the niggers furnished 
the best part of the entertainment. 
He got the people worked up to 
such a pitch, by his vivid descrip- 
tion of various horrid diseases and 
their symptoms, that it was not a 
question among his credulous hear- 
ers as to whether fhey were sick 
then, but that perhaps they would 
be at some future time. He gath- 
ered in money by the thousands, 
from the sale of his medicine. When 
interest lagged, as after a few days 
it did, he advertised in the papers 
that he was going to throw money 
broadcast upon the streets of the 
city, to be picked up by the people 
that followed his carriage to the lec- 
ture platform. I say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that I was hu- 
miliated to see crowds following 
the man. He held before him a lit- 
tle valise containing a great many 
pennies, a few quarters, and per- 
haps one or two half dollars; and 
every three or four rods, as he went 
down the street, he would take a 
handful of copper pennies and 
throw in the midst of the people. 



After the crowd had scrambled for 
these copper pennies, I saw women 
coming from the midst with their 
dresses torn, and children almost 
maimed. I was astonished, and 
wondered what the people were 
thinking of, and I resolved to speak 
of it in public- the first chance I got. 
I was told, by one of the officers of 
the city, that one evening this man 
sold bottles of his medicine as fast 
as four men could hand them out, 
individuals almost climbing over 
one another to get it, and the fakir 
sold over $600.00 worth; the peo- 
ple were almost as eager to pur- 
chase it as they were to pick up the 
copper pennies from the dust of 
the road. My brethren and sisters, 
I strongly denounce this as wrong; 
and I hope that such a sight will 
never again be seen in Utah. No 
fakir in the world ever gave people 
something for nothing." My coun- 
sel to the people is that, if any ars 
sick, and have not faith enough to 
be cured by administration of the 
Elders of the Church, send for a 
doctor that you know and get his 
advice, one who lives in the com- 
munity where you live and has a 
reputation to maintain. 

We also have eye doctors, so- 
called, traveling among us. I re- 
member, years ago, meeting one in 
a little town in the southern part of 
Utah. I knew the man well; he 
was a resident of Idaho, and a 
blacksmith by trade. I was sur- 
prised to see him there, and asked 
him what he was doing away down 
in the southern part of Utah. He 
told me that trade had been rather 
dull and he thought that, perhaps, 
he could make more money, and 
make it easier, by selling spectacles 
to the people than by following his 
trade. "Well," I said, "Heber you 
are not a doctor ; you know nothing

about the eye ; aren't you afraid that 
you are going to injure somebody's 
eyes by selling spectacles that you 
know nothing about, especially 
when you can not fit them proper- 
ly?" "Oh," he said, "Brother 
Smoot, they will never hurt any- 
body; they are only common win- 
dow glass ; they cost only thirty-six 
dollars a gross." He told me how 
he proceeded in selling: these spec- 
tacles. He would go into a town, 
and the first place at which he 
would call was the residence of the 
Bishop of the ward ; and if he suc- 
ceeded in selling the Bishop's son 
or daughter a pair of spectacles, his 
spectacles would immediately be- 
come popular in the neighborhood. 
He found hundreds who imagined 
that their eyes needed doctoring, 
and that spectacles were absolutely 
necessary. I could say more along 
this line, but this will suffice. 

There is another objectionable 
thing to which I desire to call your 
attention — that is patent medicines. 
I wish to say, however.that since the 
pure food law passed people are 
somewhat protected, and conditions 
are considerably better. I have a list 
of positively dangerous patent med- 
icines, rpublished by a man who has 
taken great interest in the subject. 
This man warns the people against 
the use of patent medicines ; and he 
names the ingredients of many that 
are well known and popular, show- 
ing that they contain drugs serious- 
ly injurious to the people using 
them. You are familiar with 
"Mother Winslow's Soothing Sy- 
rup," a decoction that soothes the 
baby to the grave, so slowly, but oh, 
so surely. "Peruna," "the booze 
medicine," as it is called, is another 
well known. I haven't the time 
now to enumerate the long list that 
he warns the people of this coun- 



try against buying or using. I wish 
to say here today that I hope the 
Latter-day Saints will let such stuff 
alone. 

There is another evil that I 
want to call your attention to, be- 
cause I see it so plainly, not only 
in this part of the land, but all over 
tlie country, and that is over-spec- 
ulation. I am not going to say that 
you must not deal in stocks, or that 
it is not your prerogative and right 
to buy anything on earth you wish 
to ; but I do assert tliat there is too 
much speculation in stocks, most of 
the transactions being on margins, 
and there is a reckoning day coming 
as sure as the sun will rise tomor- 
row morning. If you have the 
money, buy what you feel it is 
proper for you to do, but don't 
jeopardize your good name nor 
your credit; don't jeopardize 
the good name or the credit 
of a friend for the purpose 
of speculating in any kind of stocks. 
Now, I might continue on this line, 
and preach a sermon about the evil 
of debt ; such advice is always good, 
always timely, and it does seem to 
me that, at this particular time, it is 
proper to counsel the people to keep 
out of debt, and, if in debt, to get 
out as soon as possible. 

On the train the other day, com- 
ing from New York, I met a gen- 
tleman, and, in conversation with 
him, the question of religioH came 
up. He, I believe, is a type of mil- 
lions of men. He was indifferent 
to all kinds of religion, and had lit- 
tle use for creeds ; his attitude con- 
vinced me that the sin of indiffer- 
ence is one of the worst things we 
have to contend with today. Every 
missionary who goes into the field, 
everyone who travels upon the rail- 
roads in any pari of this country, 
encounters this prevailing sin of in-

difference. We see it even in our 
communities and, I might say, on 
all hands. This man told me he be- 
lieved that, as long as he had 
strength of body and vigor of mind 
it was his duty to provide for his 
wife — she was all on earth that is 
dependent upon him, he having no 
children — and surround themselves 
with all the luxury and comforts 
possible to attain. Said he, "After 
my strength is gone, when I am old, 
then is time enough to take up the 
question of religion." I never could 
believe in this doctrine, the next 
thing to death-bed repentance, nor 
do I see how any sane man can be- 
lieve it. This man believed it was 
improper for him to use any influ- 
ence whatever to induce people to 
study religion; and I quietly sug- 
gested to him that I had doubt as 
to whether he had the right to claim 
to be a Christian. He shied at that, 
but reminded me of the boy who 
summed up his father's religious 
standing in these words: "Yes, 
Dad's a Christian, but he does 
mighty little at it." That is the 
way with the world today; many 
millions claim to be Christians, but 
they do "mighty little at it." They 
will wake up some time and find it 
is too late, that procrastination has 
cost them dearly in this life, and I 
have no doubt will seriously affect 
them in the life to come. There is 
nothing that steals man's time, his 
talents, his vigor, his energy, even 
his prospects of salvation, in great- 
er degree than the crime of procras- 
tination. Procrastination means 
making an appointment with oppor- 
tunity and then asking her to come 
around some future time. My 
brethren and sisters, I hope that 
whatever good we undertake to do 
we will do it with all our hearts. 
Let us give the best part of our 



lives to the service of God. I take 
the view directly opposite to that 
expressed by this man. I think 
that the time to give God the ser- 
vice He desires of us is when we 
have the full strength of our bodies 
and all the vigor of our minds. 

I desire to advise my young 
brethren and sisters to be faithful to 
their fathers and mothers, not only 
to honor them as such, but let ine 
ask you to make life just as easy 
for them as you can, and to do it 
now. Don't wait for some future 
opportunity; I know from personal 
experience what that means. I 
used to build air-castles, and the 
trouble with them was that they 
were always built in the wrong di- 
rection — I tried to construct them 
from the top to the bottom, instead 
of from the foundation to the top. 
While a boy, I was always antici- 
pating the time when I could take 
my mother back to old Norway, the 
place of her birth, back to the old 
homestead, and show the people 
there what the Church of Jesus 
Christ, "Mormonism," had done for 
her. I dreamed of the day when 
that pleasure would come to me and 
to her ; but I left it until too late— 
my mother passed to the great be- 
yond, and my desire was not ac- 
complished. Perhaps every boy and 
girl builds a similar style of air- 
castle ; they think of what they will 
do for their parents, when they are 
able to, at some future time. My 
advice, my. young brethren and sis- 
ters, is, Don't wait, but do what- 
ever you can to make life happy 
for them as soon as you can. If you 
don't take your parents on a jour- 
ney, you can do a thousand and one 
other things that will help to make 
the path of father and mother eas- 
ier, and thus bring joy and peace 
to those who gave you birth.

I rejoice in the growth of the 
work of God. I reioice in seeing 
the baptisms increase as they are 
doing in all parts of the missionary 
field. It is true that many people 
are opposing the Church, but the 
Church is like the mustard tree, the 
more you kick it the more the seeds 
spread. If people wish to oppose 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, let them 
oppose it, it is their loss; but as 
sure as God lives it is true, and He 
will see that this work goes on to 
final victorv. 

I wish to say to you husbands 
and wives, be considerate of each 
other in your homes, be appreciat- 
ive, and speak all the good you can 
of each other. Husbands, tell your 
wives how much you esteem their 
labors in the home ; wives tell your 
husbands how interested you are in 
their struggles. A little praise in 
this life is a very good thing. I 
would rather have a single flower 
given to me in life by a friend than 
I would have my coffin banked with 
roses. Fathers, stop and observe 
the constant labors of the mother, 
day in and day .out, year in and 
year out, consider how she has 
helped you to make the home, and 
sustained the trials of motherhood, 
and then don't be afraid to tell her 
you appreciate all, don't leave it un- 
til she is on her death bed. And so 
I might say to the wife : be interest- 
ed in what your husband is doing; 
encourage him along the line that 
he is laboring. If you mutually do 
this, you will love one another bet- 
ter, there will be a stronger bond 
between parents and children than 
if you neglect these courtesies 'and 
leave things to be taken for granted. 

I ask the blessings of our heav- 
enly Father upon the people as a 
whole, and upon His Church. May 
the Church grow and increase, even 



as fast as the Father would have it. 
This with all other blessings that 
the Father sees the people need, I 
pray for, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Elder John W. Summerhays and 
Noel S. Pratt sang, as a duet, the 
hymn beginning: 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 

Lo ! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day 

Majestic rises on the world.

My brethren and sisters : To face 
this vast assemblage this morning 
makes me tremble. I believe I can 
sympathize, now, with a four-year 
old boy who was asked by a magi- 
cian to come up on the platform, 
and who became quite overwhelmed 
as the magician apparently took 
from the little boy handkerchiefs, 
watches, eggs and other miscella- 
neous articles. When he got back 
to his parents and friends he was 
asked how he felt. "O my!" he 
said, "I just shivered." Well, I 
"shiver" when I am called upon to 
face an audience of Latter-day 
Saints, not from fear of my breth- 
ren and sisters, because I look 
upon them as dear friends and sym- 
pathizers, but I tremble because of 
the responsibility that I feel in this 
position, realizing my inability to 
sustain that responsibility without 
their aid, and without the inspira- 
tion of the Almighty. So I tremble, 
this morning, and pray for your as-

sistance and for the same spirit that 
has prompted the remarks through- 
out this conference. 

I am thankful, and my heart is 
made glad, when I listen to the re- 
ports and testimonies concerning 
the growth of the Church of Jesus 
Christ; and I rejoice more when I 
realize that this is a true growth — 
that the Church is growing from 
within, in harmony with natural 
law and with the spiritual law. It 
is not a spontaneous outburst of 
enthusiasm, it is not made to ap- 
pear large by any outward, sign. As 
I have just said, the Church is 
growing from within ; and that is 
the condition that makes my heart 
rejoice this morning. When I lis- 
tened to the reports of our enemies' 
attacks upon us, I thought : how 
futile all their efforts will be, if we . 
but remain true to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. I picture the Church 
as a mighty oak, against which little 
boys throw mud, covering the bark, 
and sometimes injuring the leaves ; 
they even use their pen-knives in an 
attempt to chop down the tree. At 
worst, they only riddle a few 
leaves and besmear the bark. In a 
few days, the mud is all gone, the 
rains have washed it off. The life 
of the oak has pushed out new bark 
and new leaves ; and the mud, 
which defaced only the outward 
part, is all gone. Why? Because 
the life of the oak was untouched, 
and it had the power within it to 
throw off those excrecences thrown 
upon it by thoughtless boys, or ma- 
licious youths. So it is with the 
Church — calumny cannot hurt it, if 
it is pure within. We are told that 
"He who steals my purse steals 
trash, 'twas something, nothing; 
'twas mine, 'tis his, and has been 
slave to thousands ; but he who 
filches from me my good name robs 



me of that which naught enricheth 
him, but leaves me poor indeed." 
But we are poor only in the fact 
that he has injured or robbed us of 
our reputation, or good name. If 
we are true within, if our souls are 
unimpaired, if we remain steadfast 
to the integrity of our lives, to the 
Gospel, we are just as pure, and as 
strong, and as rich in the eyes of 
God, who sees the heart and judges 
therefrom. 

My brethren and sisters, this feel- 
ing, this desire to be all that the 
Gospel would have us become, is 
what I would like to speak about 
this morning; that the true life 
within is what we should put forth 
efforts to protect. No matter what 
a man is thought of by his fellow 
men, as Brother Grant intimated 
yesterday, if he is true, God is his 
friend, and he is rich indeed. In 
the twelfth chapter of First Cor- 
inthians, the Church is compared to 
a person. We are dual beings ; our 
body, the outward part — the temple, 
if you please ; the spirit within, the 
true life. So, the apostle says, is 
the Church : 

"For as the body is one, and hath 
many members, and all the members of 
that one body, being many, are one 
body; so also is Christ. For by one 
Spirit are we all baptized into one body, 
whether we be JeWs or Gentiles.whether 
we be bond or free; and have been all 
made to drink into one Spirit. For the 
body is not one member but many. . . 
. . If the whole body were an eye, 
where were the hearing? If the whole 
were hearing, where were the smelling? 
But now hath God set the members ev- 
eiy one of them in the body, as it hath 
pleased him. And if they were all one 
member, where were the body? But 
now are they many members, yet but 
one body. And the eye cannot say unto 
the hand, I have no need of thee; nor 
again, the head to the feet, I have no 
need of you. Nay, much more, those 
members of the body, which seem to be 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



61 



more feeble, are necessary: and those 
members of the body, which we think to 
be less honorable, upon these we bestow 
more abundant honor ; and our uncome- 
ly parts have more abundant comeli- 
ness, . . . And whether one member 
suffer, all the members suffer with it ; or 
one member be honored, all the mem- 
bers rejoice with it. Now ye are the 
bodv of Christ, and members in particu- 
lar." 

I like that comparison because it 
suggests the element I mentioned in 
the beginning : true growth. Take 
one's body, what does it need? 
When is it in good condition? I 
have here a selection from the work 
of Everett Hale, in which he men- 
tions our physical needs ; he says : 

"The peril of this century is physical 
decay. This peril is gravely eminent 
with respect to all who dwell in our 
great cities. All the conditions. of life in 
the modern American city favor it, 
wealth or the accumulation of the where- 
with to gratify the desires is the great 
incentive of our contemporaneous life, 
and under its fevered stimulation, vast 
numbers of men and women, utterly 
careless of the body's needs or demands, 
struggle in the great conflict, and even- 
tually go down victims of the unchange- 
able law of Nature which decrees that 
the fittest shall survive; and all these 
weak persons, who succumb to the inev- 
itable before they have reached the ul- 
timate span of life, bear or beget chil- 
dren who are weak in proportion as their 
parents were weak, and these children, 
not possessing strength, resisting power 
and vitality, succumb quicker than their 
forbears. There is a great natural truth, 
universally demonstrated, with regard 
to the various forms of living organ- 
isms, and that is when all the functions 
of the body work together harmonious- 
ly — such as the digestion, the respiration, 
the circulation and the excretion, there 
is found a normal, strong, healthy or- 
ganism, capable of existing under con- 
ditions that would mean the quick disso- 
lution of one in which there was a de- 
rangement of the natural functions." 

How much more beautiful is 
that woman who has natural beauty 



because of true growth, because of 
the working harmoniously together 
of all the ' organs of the body to 
foster and build up the demands, 
the needs of nature, than she who 
plastering the outside, tries to get 
beauty from without. The latter 
cannot be compared to that beauty 
which comes from true growth, 
and which results from the healthy 
condition of every organ of the 
body. How strong is that man, how 
admirable in structure, who has 
health throughout his body, whose 
organs are in good condition ! The 
healthy man, who" takes care of his 
physical being, has strength and 
vitality; his temple, if you please, 
is a fit place for his spirit to reside 
in. There are many things that 
attack the vitality of the body. We 
expose ourselves to disease; it gets 
into an organ that is somewhat im- 
paired, then the ravages of disease 
weakens that and impairs other or- 
gans, the result being that the body 
succumbs to the attack. Only the 
other day, a brother and I were 
called to administer to a woman, a 
mother. Two weeks ago she was 
healthy and strong, a beautiful 
young frwoman. She exposed her- 
self — not needlessly either — by go- 
ing to a place where the water was 
impregnated with typhoid germs. 
Those germs entered her system, 
and attacked the organs of her 
body. One organ after another be- 
came impaired and deranged, and 
when we reached her bedside we 
found that she was literally pois- 
oned by the ravages of that disease. 
If you had heard her husband's 
prayer, as he knelt by the bedside, 
pleading with God to abate that fe- 
ver, to restore his wife to him and 
to the two little children.your hearts 
would have been touched as ours 
were, and vour faith would have 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been exercised, as ours was, that 
she might be restored, the ravages 
of the disease be counteracted, that 
she might again enjoy good health 
and strength. 

Bodily ailments deprive us of the 
full exercise of our faculties and 
privileges and sometimes of life it- 
self. It is necessary, therefore, to 
take care of the body. But, great 
as is the peril of physical decay, 
greater, far greater, is the peril of 
spiritual decay. The peril of this 
century is spiritual apathy. As the 
body requires sunlight, good food, 
proper exercise and rest, so the 
spirit of man requires the sunlight 
of the Holy Spirit ; proper exercise 
of the spiritual functions ; the avoid- 
ing of evils that affect spiritual 
health, that are more ravaging in 
their effects than typhoid fever, 
pneumonia, or other diseases that 
attack the body. These diseases 
may stop the manifestations of life 
in the body, but the spirit still lives. 
When disease of the spirit conquers, 
the life dies eternally. Such an ex- 
treme spiritual disease would, of 
necessity, be an unpardonable sin. 
When men get spiritually sick, they 
do not care much for religion* They 
think it not necessary for them to 
attend to their spiritual wants. Dis- 
satisfied with themselves, they find 
fault with those who do enjoy the 
true life of spirituality. Why? Be- 
cause they don't know what real 
spiritual life is. Their bodies are 
succumbing to the diseases that are 
attacking the spirit. How? Why, 
in many ways. Those boys who 
sat, one week ago, in the rear room 
of a saloon, playing cards for hours, 
drinking whisky or beer, profaning 
the name of God — invited into their 
souls a malady that is more fatal 
than typhoid fever, or any other 
disease that can attack the body. 



Their spiritual life was being de- 
ranged ; it is deranged. Though the 
mothers did not detect, when their 
boys came home that night, just 
how deeply imbedded were the 
germs of that spiritual disease, the 
germs were there, and those boys' 
spirits were poisoned. This condi- 
tion kept them from Sabbath school 
the next Sunday; it keeps them 
from their quorum meetings dur- 
ing the week; it keeps them from 
the Mutual Improvement assembly ; 
they have not the life, the moral 
strength to go to these places for 
spiritual sunlight, and the healthful 
exercise of the spirit. The man who 
hates his brother, and kneels down 
for prayer with that hate in his 
heart, has in his spirit a disease 
which will impair his spiritual life. 
The man who cheats his neighbor— 
I care not whether anybody knows 
it or not, he knows it (remember 
it is the real growth we are speak- 
ing of) — the man who takes advan- 
tage of a brother is weakening his 
spirituality. He cannot enjoy true 
growth in this Church, so long as 
he harbors that dishonest sentiment. 
Dishonesty is a spiritual disease. 
The man who steals' is inviting into 
his soul that which will prevent him 
from growing to the perfect stature 
of Christ. The man who fails in 
any way to live up to that which 
God and conscience tell him is right 
is weakening his spirituality— in 
other words, is depriving himself 
of the sunlight in which his spiritual 
nature will grow. 

Let us then, as individuals, grow 
from within; be what President 
Smith suggested at the opening of 
this conference: be men of God, 
pure within, repentant ; for no man, 
said he, can gain salvation unless he 
repents of his sins. No matter 
where we are, no matter what peo- 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY. 



63 



pie outside of this Church may 
think of us, no matter what the 
ministers of the world may say, we 
are what our inner life makes us, 
what God knows we are. If our 
character is true, the mud they 
throw upon us will at some time 
fall off, and we shall stand pure 
and undefiled. As the world shall 
some day know that Christ is the 
Son of God, so shall they know that 
the members of this Church, being 
true within, are His righteous fol- 
lowers. 

There is another important fac- 
tor in our lives that is also sugges- 
tive of the body and spirit, and that 
is the home. Every home has both 
body and spirit. You may have a 
beautiful house, with all the dec- 
orations that modern art can give, 
or wealth bestow. You may have 
all the outward forms that will 
please the eye, and yet not have a 
home. It is not home without love. 
It may be a hovel, a log hut, a tent, 
a wikeup, if you have the right 
spirit within, the true love of Christ, 
and love for one another — fathers 
and mothers for the children, chil- 
dren for parents, husband and wife 
for each other — you have the true 
life of the home that Latter-day 
Saints build, and which they are 
striving to establish. No matter 
what they may be without, are your 
homes pure within? Are morning 
prayers offered there regularly? Or 
do the things of this world take . you 
away from your homes and make 
you deprive yourself of morning 
prayers with the children? "Woe 
to that home where the mother 
abandons her holy mission or neg- 
lects the divine instruction, influ- 
ence and example, — while she bows 
a devotee at the shrine of social 
pleasure; or neglects the essential 
duties in her own household, in her 



enthusiasm to promote public re- 
form." We must consider the 
home ; it is the spring of life, if you 
please, of our social conditions to- 
day. It is no winder, when we 
think of some home pictures that 
are shown to us, that millions and 
billions of dollars are spent trying 
to- purify streams made impure bv 
the unholy fountains of home life 
in the world. One author gives us 
a description of such a home — a 
home in which the parents lived 
lawless lives, and subsisted, like 
leeches, upon what they could ex- 
tort from their fellow men. In this 
environment two young girls grew 
to womanhood — what were they? 

"Sad creatures, without name, without 
sex, to whom neither good nor evil were 
any longer possible, and for whom, on 
leaving childhood there is nothing more 
in this world : neither liberty, nor virtue, 
nor responsibility. Souls blooming yes- 
terday, faded today: like those flowers 
which fall in the street and are bespat- 
tered with mud before a wheel crushes 
them." 

From such homes come the men 
who are trespassing upon the rights 
of others ; come women who are de- 
graded, and who are dragging their 
virtue and that of others in the 
mud. It is such homes frpm which 
springs much of the evil in society 
today. I wish the money now spent 
in police and detective work could 
be used in purifying those homes. 
What the world needs today is good 
parents. Where parents are incap- 
able of rearing their children prop- 
erly, the state should assist by 
means of guardians of the young 
who should be required to do in- 
dividual work. 

Latter-day Saints, how thankful 
I am that true "Mormon" homes 
are pure homes — you know they 
are ; if they are not pure, they are 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not Latter-day Saint homes, no 
matter what the world thinks. We 
know the lives of the Latter-day 
Saints, and we know that their in- 
fluence is to produce pure boys and 
girls ; O, my heart rejoices that 
we can bear testimony to the world 
that the homes of the Latter-day 
Saints are godly homes. If there 
are those among us who contami- 
nate the world, or who take advan- 
tage of .their neighbors, we can 
truly say they have not been influ- 
enced by the Latter-day Saint home, 
but by influences they have come in 
contact with outside the home. Par- 
ents, you Latter-day Saints, let us 
beautify our homes. It is all right 
to make them as attractive as pos- 
sible, .but O, live within, live with- 
in ! If mothers feel incompetent to 
train their children, if they find that 
there are conditions outside which 
are counteracting their influence in 
the home, go to the parents' classes, 
and there unite with your neighbors 
in overcoming the social conditions 
that may be contaminating your 
children. Let us live within. 

The body of the Church is com- 
posed of many members, yet all one 
body; and it is healthy, vigorous, 
strong, and influential when all the 
members of that body are working 
harmoniously together. You Dea- 
cons, think of your quorum ; you are 
members of the body. If you in- 
jure your finger, the whole body 
suffers; and if a little Deacon's 
quorum, away off in some remote 
stake or ward, is inactive, to that 
extent the body of this Church is 
suffering. You who preside over 
Teachers' quorums, see that the 
body is in healthy condition. You 
Elders throughout the Church, and 
you presidents of Elders' quorums, 
how is the spirituality of your 
quorum? You have the outward 



form ; you have your meetings, and 
your courses of study; but are the 
members of the body all in good 
condition? If so, happy are you, 
and you are promoting the welfare 
of the Church. You Seventies, you 
are called upon now to make a spe- 
cial effort each Sunday morning to 
put that body of men in proper con- 
dition. If any members of these 
quorums be not in condition 
for service, the body will suf- 
fer to that extent. We want all the 
members of the Church to be in true 
working order. If we are true 
within we shall grow, and the whole 
Church then is strong. What mat- 
ters it though the world turn 
against us? If we are one, if we 
are pure, if we are sincere, God is 
our stay and our inspirer. The 
world cannot hurt us any more than 
the lions hurt Daniel, in the den 
when God protected him. They 
cannot hurt us any more than the 
fire hurt the three Hebrew children 
when they were cast into the flame. 

My voice is not adapted to ad- 
dress this audience, and I fear that 
it is grating on you; but there is 
one more truth which I wish to ex 
press before closing. I wish to 
bear testimony that I know that 
this Church is the Church of Jesus 
Christ. We are strong in it only to 
the extent that we are pure and true 
as individuals, as members, as lead- 
ers in organizations. I know that 
the men who lead this Church are 
men of God; I know their hearts: 
and you know them. You know 
that they have nothing but good for 
you, and for the whole world. I 
know the three men who stand at 
the head of this Church, who sit 
here today, are inspired men ; God 
bless them. May He bless all who 
are striving to establish truth 
among mankind, is my prayer, and

Amen.

ELDER RULON" S. WELLS. 

My brethren and sisters : That 
I may be led by the Spirit of the 
Lord is the sincere desire of my 
heart at this time. I feel the great 
responsibility in standing before 
this vast congregation, and, unless 
my heavenly Father shall aid me, 
I feel that I will not be able to 
speak to you satisfactorily. 

Reference has been made today, 
by one of the speakers, to the great 
sin of indifference. I wish to echo 
my belief that this sin is one of the 
prevailing ones in the world. I ap- 
preciate the fact that this congrega- 
tion may not be charged with that 
evil; their presence here is evidence 
tli at they do feel some interest in 
the welfare of Zion, and that they 
are not totally indifferent to the 
word of the Lord. I appreciate the 
fact that they have come up hither 
to be fed the bread of life. I re- 
joice in the words that have been 
spoken. My soul has been made to 
feel that I have been fed the bread 
of life, and I believe that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints assembled here to- 
day have that same sentiment in 
their bosoms, and they rejoice in 
the truths of the everlasting Gospel. 
They rejoice in the influence of 
God's Holy Spirit that has been 
made manifest in our midst. Nev- 
ertheless there are of our own num- 
ber many who are indifferent re- 
garding the religion which has been 
revealed in the day and age in 



which we live. The great enemy to 
religion is this spirit of indifference. 
Men are prone to take advantage 
of the free agency which our heav- 
enly Father, in His infinite wisdom, 
has given to every soul, and in tak- 
ing this advantage they have mis- 
applied that agency, in making a 
wrong use of the talents and abil- 
ity with which our Father has en- 
dowed them. 

There are two things which are 
very valuable to every human soul. 
There are others, but I wish to 
point out these two and the wrong 
use that is being made of them. 
They were given to us for an all- 
wise purpose, and with the bestow- 
al of these gifts upon us, came the 
responsibility of making a proper 
use of them. The two things to 
which I refer are time and money. 
Some one has said that "time is 
money." We will all concede that 
both are regarded by the children 
of men as ranking among the 
things of greatest worth. If they 
are valuable to us as individuals, 
let us ask ourselves the question: 
Are they not also valuable in the 
bringing to pass of God's purposes 
among the children of men? What 
are we doing with our time and 
money? Are we devoting these 
great gifts of God unto our own 
selfish purposes, or are they being 
devoted to the service of God who 
made us? There are some who are 
foolish enough to think that if they 
devote a few hours of their time to 
serving the Lord that that is all He 
requires of them. They argue that, 
if they go to church upon the Sab- 
bath day, if they attend the Mutual 
Improvement Association, or per- 
form some other particular duty 
that devolves upon them, by reason 
of an appointment which they have 
received, they think that all the rest 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of their time belongs to themselves, 
and they can do with it just as they 
please. My brethren and sisters, if 
any have taken that view they do 
not understand the responsibility 
that the Lord has placed upon us, 
in giving us the life we have to 
spend upon this earth. 

The Lord expects us to devote 
all our time in serving Him. That 
may be regarded by some as an ex- 
travagant expression, but, if you 
will stop to analyze it, you will find 
that the Lord expects no less of you. 
The same thing can be said of 
money, the accumulation of wealth. 
Many argue : If I pay my tithes and 
offerings to the Lord, all the rest 
of my money belongs to me, and I 
will do with that just as I wish. 
This again is a false conception of 
what God expects from every child 
of His. As in the case of time, so 
with our wealth, the Lord expects 
us to devote it all to His service, 
and in the accomplishment of His 
great purposes upon this earth. 
That may again surprise you, but if 
you will stop to analyze it, you will 
find that He expects no less from 
every one of us. But may I not 
employ a part of my time in earn- 
ing a livelihood _ for my family? 
Yes, certainly. But cannot you at 
the same time serve God ? Is it not 
a service to God when we provide 
for our own? Has not the injunc- 
tion been laid upon us by inspired 
men that we should support our 
families? and is it not written that 
"he who will not provide for his 
own hath denied the faith and is 
worse than an infidel?" It makes 
a great deal of difference how we 
provide for our own, whether in the 
employment of our time we are us- 
ing it in the proper way and with 
honest purpose, or whether we are 
wasting that time or making an im- 



proper use of it. The same with 
wealth : May I not use a part of 
the means that God has blessed me 
with in giving to my family the 
necessaries of life? May I not 
leave some of that for the benefit 
and welfare of my family? Yes, 
most assuredly; that responsibility 
is also enjoined upon us. It is not 
alone in the payment of tithing that 
we have the opportunity of serving 
God, but we also have the oppor" 
tunity of serving him in the use of 
every other dollar that we spend, 
and we ought to see to it that we 
spend our own money in the proper 
way, and in a way that will be in 
harmony with the will of God. If 
we were to employ our means in 
gratifying the lusts of the flesh, in 
profligate life, would that be con- 
sidered a service of God? Certain- 
ly not. If we leave immense for- 
tunes to our families without giv- 
ing them the necessary wisdom to 
employ that money in the service 
of God, but leave it for them to 
waste away in wickedness and sin, 
that thereby they apostatize from 
the truth, would you call that a 
service of God? No, most assur- 
edly not. Hence, those who are 
entrusted with great fortunes ought 
to consider in what way their 
means will be employed to further 
the purposes of God. One thing 
that I think ought to be encouraged 
among the well-to-do Latter-day 
Saints is to employ their means in 
such a way that every dollar of it 
may eventually be used to build up 
God's kingdom upon this earth; 
and, if they are able to prevent it, 
that not one dollar of their money 
should be utilized against the pur- 
poses of our Heavenly Father. It 
is this indifference regarding the 
employment of our time and of our 
money, the indifferent manner in 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



67 



which we regard these precious 
gifts, that leads us oftentimes in the 
ways of wrong and error. The 
proper employment of our time and 
our money will develop spiritual 
growth; it will develop that relig- 
ious fervor which ought to abound 
among the Latter-day Saints, and 
which in many cases is woefully 
wanting. It seems to me that if 
we can surround our families by 
wholesome influences, by a proper 
utilizing of these gifts which our 
Father has given to us, if we create 
a love of the truth, so that every 
energy, every gift, all the time and 
all the means that we have may be 
devoted to the service of God, a 
more wholesome influence would be 
in the families of the Latter-day 
Saints. Some people think that 
they are not religious, that it is not 
necessary that they should be so 
devoted to God. It seems to me 
that a want of religion, a want of 
religious fervor, a want of spir- 
ituality, is mental deformity, more 
hideous than any physical defor- 
mity that we know anything about. 
Rather would I have my children 
maimed; rather would I have them 
without an eye, without a limb, 
without an arm, or some other im- 
portant member, and thus be de- 
formed through their natural life, 
than to have this mental deformity, 
this want of true religion, without 
which we form a false conception 
of the use that should be made of 
the things God has given us. It 
seems to me that if we love the 
truth, and love God with all our 
souls and with all our hearts, we 
can form no other conception of our 
obligations t© Him. "Son, give Me 
thy heart," is the commandment of 
God to every soul, and it means 
this: that we should give to God 
our lives, because the heart is an 



organ of life, the vital organ which 
causes the life fluid to circulate 
throughout the body, imparting vi- 
tality to every part. So that, the 
Lord requires us to give our hearts, 
our whole lives in His service, and 
that means all we have and all that 
are, our time, our talents, our 
wealth, all should be devoted to the 
service of God. 

Brethren and sisters, let us en- 
deavor, as members of the Church 
of Christ, to devolp this conception 
of our obligations to our heavenly 
Father. You laborers in Zion, ask 
yourselves the question whether or 
not the interests that are entrusted 
to your care are suffering, because, 
terchance, your time is being devot- 
ed in some other direction? Are 
any of the interests entrusted to 
yon languishing because you feel 
t at you must be out with your 
herds of sheep, or with your cattle 
upon a thousand hills ? Are any of 
the interests of Zion suffering at 
:ne hands of any of the Elders of 
Israel, because they are begrudging 
ihe use of the means that God has 
blessed them with? 

My brethren and sisters, I testify 
to you that I know this is the work 
of God ; I know it of myself and 
not from another. I know that Jos- 
eph Smith is a prophet sent of God 
to usher in this great and glorious 
dispensation, the dispensation of 
the fulness of times. I know that 
the men who stand at the head of 
this Church today are inspired of 
God, and are there by His appoint- 
ment. May we uphold and sustain 
them ; may we prove by our good 
works that we are devoted to that 
cause in which they are spending 
the energies of their lives, their 
time, and their means, in helping to 
accomplish God's holy purposes;' 
may the Lord help us to do these

ELDER JOSEPH E. ROBINSON. 

(President of California Mission.) 

I sincerely desire your prayers of 
faith, my brethren and sisters, in 
my behalf, that the time I occupy 
shall be of mutual worth and ad- 
vantage. I rejoice in the testimony 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, sensing the fact that it is 
"the power of God unto salvation." 
I rejoice in the labors which have 
been assigned to me, and in the 
companionship of some of the 
bright and noble spirits with which 
God has blessed the fathers and 
mothers of Zion, my companions in 
the mission field. I note the faces 
of some of the parents of my com- 
panions in this audience. I note, 
too, some of my brethren who have 
been honorably released and re- 



turned home to their loved ones and 
the home circle. 

The work in our mission is go- 
ing on apace. We have been able 
to do a little better this year than 
last, despite the fact that there have 
been some contingencies arise that 
have, in a way, deprived us of ac- 
complishing all we might have done. 
There is a very unsettled condition, 
politically and socially, in some 
parts of California. You who have 
read the papers know something of 
the conditions that have obtained 
in the city of San Francisco, since 
the Lord visited that place with an 
earthquake, eighteen months ago, 
The conditions that prevail there 
now are very deplorable, from a so- 
cial and civil standpoint. This has 
hampered our work in what was 
the biggest city and the best field 
that we had in the mission. In Los 
Angeles, a new survey of the city 
streets and the removal of some 
buildings, made it obligatory upon 
us to vacate the church that we had 
occupied for some four years. This 
upset the work a little while, in that 
city. Also, during the month of 
August, when we have very pecu- 
liar weather, several of the Elders, 
nearly every Elder, I might say, in 
the mission suffered from an at- 
tack of the"grip." One of our breth- 
ren, a dearly beloved Elder, died 
after 40 hours of illness. This was 
a sad blow to us in our field, be- 
ing the first of the kind that I have 
met in my experience. Other mat- 
ters, such as the burning of all our 
tracts forwarded from the South- 
ern States mission, in a railroad 
wreck ; the fact that the enemy had 
aroused the animosity, of some of 
the police officers in two of the lead- 
ing cities, Sacramento and Los An- 
geles, who forbade us the occupa- 
tion of corners where we had been

used to holding- our street meetings, 
and sent us into some of the larger 
alleys, also handicapped us for a 
short period. But during the Irri- 
gation Congress, when the Ogden 
Tabernacle Choir visited us, and 
sang for the people there, the pre- 
judice was largely removed, and 
our conditions are much more fa- 
vorable toda»y, and we are going on, 
as I said in the beginning, better 
than we did last season. We have 
not as yet been able, seemingly, to 
resort to the successful way of sell- 
ing books as have some of our 
brethren in eastern fields. If you 
offer a book to the average Cali- 
fornian, he wants to know if there 
is any money in it, before he buys 
or accepts it; and if you make an- 
swer, as President Joseph F. Smith 
did one time when this same ques- 
tion was put to him as a boy mis- 
sionary in that state, in the early 
fifties, that "it has in it the eternal 
riches of heaven," they will reply 
that California is a good enough 
heaven for them. But there are 
some of our Elders who made a 
very excellent record last month in 
the sale of books, and it encouraged 
us, and we hope to emulate the ex- 
ample of our more successful breth- 
ren in the eastern states missions. 

I rejoice in the testimonies that 
have been borne by the brethren at 
this conference, and in the spirit of 
the conference. The remarks of 
President Smith and of the breth- 
ren who followed in the same line 
of thought, in relation to the proper 
development of our youth, the care 
of our children, the education of 
the sons of men, recalling to my 
mind some of the statements made 
by the leading educators of Amer- 
ica, in the late National Educators' 
Association that met in the city of 
Los Angeles. President Shafer, in 



opening that Congress, spoke of the 
proud record that had been made 
by the United States in the past 
fifty years, since that Association 
was instituted. He called attention 
to the fact that there were some un- 
desirable features in our education- 
al system, and also that there were 
coming to our land people who 
seemed not to appreciate its institu- 
tions, its freedom and its liberty. To 
correct this, he thought it would 
be necessary to teach a little more 
of Christian doctrine in the schools, 
or at least, he went so far as to say 
this, that it was necessary for the 
perpetuity of the institutions of our 
government that there should be 
Christian training of the youth of 
our country. He made a protest, 
too, in a measure, against the teach- 
ing that the only heroes of our na- 
tion, the only names that become 
immortal, almost, in the pages of 
history are those of men who have 
won their laurels upon the battle- 
ship, or upon the field of blood ; that 
when our boys and girls open the 
pages of history, the names there 
placed and decorated with laurels 
of immortality are the warriors of 
our country. He wished the teach- 
ers of America to teach the youth 
thereof that in the field of indus- 
try, or of art, commerce, or science, 
there was greater room to immor- 
talize one than upon the battle field. 
We know ourselves; my brethren 
and sisters, those who have grown 
aged, or to mature years, that the 
arts of peace have their heroes no 
less than the arts of war. But this 
does not occur to the average stu- 
dent in the schools of the day. They 
do not read much of what the great 
statesmen and social reformers of 
the world have done. They are but 
little acquainted with what Frank- 
lin, Stephenson, Watt, Howe, Edi- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



son and Marconi, have done for the 
people of this world. Possibly it is 
because they have been, some of 
them, contemporaneous with us, 
and others have left this stage of 
action but a few years since. I 
thought when the doctor was 
speaking of girls who ofttimes 
wish that they were men, because 
of having read history such as I 
have spoken of, that it would be 
an advantage to them if all read the 
life of Florence Nightingale, and 
what she did to immortalize her 
name. At a dinner party given by 
Lord Stratford, in commemoration 
of the Crimean war, when he gath- 
ered his old associates about him, 
at the wine cup after dinner, he 
proposed that each man present 
should write upon a slip of paper 
the name of the one whom he felt 
should be crowned' with immortal- 
ity, that they might have a concen- 
sus of opinion in relation to that 
person whose name should go down 
in the annals of history. Strange 
to say, when a collection of the pa- 
pers was made, they all bore the 
same name, and instead of it being 
one of the old warriors, one of the 
great chiefs of martial strife, it bore 
the name of a weak woman — Flor- 
ence Nightingale. I thought what 
an angel of peace and mercy she 
must have been to the soldiers of 
that day, that they should recog- 
nize her as the superior, in that 
sense, of all who had taken part in 
that strife. She was spoken of af- 
fectionately by one of the old sol- 
diers, who lay in a sick ward in the 
hospital. He said she came, and in 
fact was known, as the angel of 
light. He said, "She could not speak 
to us all, as she went through the 
wards where were so many suffer- 
ing, prostrate forms ; she could not 
lay her hand upon the burning brow 



of every sick soldier, but where she 
could not go, her shadow fell, and 
kissing her shadow we could turn 
our faces to the wall content to die 
in the peace of her presence." I 
thought, if a few such examples as 
this were portrayed and held forth 
before the young' women of Amer- 
ica they would not wish themselves 
unsexed; and, if they could have 
heard the remarks made by Elders 
Clawson and George Albert Smith 
yesterday, they would not seek for 
the warrior's crown, but for that 
which is most regal above all, the 
crown of sweet maternity. 

There were two other great ed- 
ucators, who, in dealing with their 
state papers in relation to the mat- 
ters of education and its bearing 
upon commerce and upon civiliza- 
tion, Professors Storm, of Iowa, 
and W. O. Thompson, of the State 
University of Ohio, each called at- 
tention to the fact that they were 
treating the topic from the view 
point that was assigned them, but 
they wanted men and women to un- 
derstand that there could be no true 
civilization, no true education, 
aside from a deep-seated religious 
conviction and Christian training. 
The sentiment of that gathering 
seemed to me to be this, that we are 
a Christian nation, a Christian peo- 
ple ; that .it was Christian fathers 
who sought out this land as a haven 
of rest wherein they might worship 
God according to the dictates of 
their conscience, untrammeled by 
the oppression and fears of the old 
world and its priestcraft; that the 
very organic act that secures to our 
people their rights and privileges 
was conceived, founded and made 
under Christian inspiration, and 
that because of a few who doubted 
the fact that there is a God over all. 
and because there are some of the

House of Judah who do not believe 
in the teachings of the New Testa- 
me nt — because these individuals are 
citizens of our great republic we 
have listened to their protest, and 
permitted the withdrawal from the 
schools of the republic the great 
text-book, the book of books, the 
Bible, and the young of our nation 
are growing up unfamiliar with its 
characters and with the ideals 
which it holds out to men. So there 
was a great discussion precipitated 
as to whether the Bible should not 
be admitted again to the schools as 
a text-book, it being thoroughly un- 
derstood that there should not be 
any teaching, in a religious sense, 
of any of the creeds, but that it 
should be placed in the hands of the 
people, that they may become fa- 
miliar with its sacred history. In 
one of the side meetings that was 
held, reviewing the statements that 
I have made in brief, the question 
arose, How shall we teach the 
youth, what shall form the basis of 
their education in a religious sense, 
and upon what shall they found 
their faith ? There were many views 
entertained and expressed, but none 
seemed satisfactory, and finally an 
appeal was made to the most learn- 
ed of all, Dr. William T. Harris/the 
great psychologist of Washington, 
D. C, to express his opinion as to 
the basis for proper religious train- 
ing and belief. If there be a man 
in the pedagogical world prepared 
to answer that philosophically, it is 
Dr. Harris, a man acquainted with 
the workings of the mind, an au- 
thority upon psvchic phenomena, a 
man familiar with the emotions of 
the soul and the workings of the 
heart. As he drew up his bent form 
— for he is an old man — he ex- 
pressed himself in this wise : 



"For the proper training and for a deep- 
seated religious conviction,that the inter- 
ests of our country may be conserved and 
its institutions perpetuated,it is absolutely 
necessary that our young shall be incul- 
cated and have the proper conception of 
a personal God." 

Tears of joy ran down my cheeks, 
my brethren and sisters, when I 
heard this. I felt, O how the little . 
leaven is leavening the entire lump. 
If the spirit of this convention shall 
go forth into the schools of these 
United States, ten years hence the 
Elders will not meet the objection 
to the teachings of Holy Writ, and 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, that they do today. The ex- 
perience I have in our field is this, 
that it does but little good to quote 
the Scriptures to the people, until 
you have convinced them that they 
are of worth and true. It is a 
proposition of "Show me by your 
philosophy or by your reason or 
logic how this can be true, and how 
this will benefit me and mine; what 
are the results of your ethics, the 
fruits of your religion or mode of 
worship, and your lives, what are 
they?" Then when we meet these 
people, we have to take them to the 
school of theology to be instructed ; 
we teach them that this is the re- 
ligion that is told of in the Scrip- 
tures, in fact that it is scriptural, 
and then only do they seem to care 
for the scriptural proof. But it 
seems to me that conditions would 
be very different indeed if this spirit 
that I have spoken of should go 
out among all the people of these 
United States. 

I have often heard Elder Heber 
J. Grant speak of one of his re- 
nowned friends in writing to him ■ 
about religion, unable to compre- 
hend it, not a devotee or member 
of any church, but viewing the

economics of "Mormonism," he 
said: "Heber, if there is anything 
in religion, there is everything in 
it." I have often quoted that, and 
yet until late years never under- 
stood its weight, and possibly now 
do not comprehend its full import. 
If we review the history of this 
world and its people, we cannot 
help but see that those who have 
lent themselves to religious training 
and impulse are the people who 
have blazed the way for education 
and civilization. They are the peo- 
ple who have conserved the best in- 
terests of the world, and have lived 
longest as nations of the earth. We 
speak of Egypt as the cradle of civ- 
ilization. Egypt had the Gospel 
preached to her, but fell by the way, 
and her glory is known only in her 
works, the pyramids of Gheza and 
Cheops, the temple of Carnack, 
which come down to us from the 
distant past, and her sphinx that 
speaks with mute tongue of the 
long silent dead. The same may be 
said of Chaldea and Babylon, al- 
most the same of Greece and of 
Rome. We go to those old coun- 
tries to study their architecture, 
their art in painting and sculpture, 
in rhetoric and verse, but the sons 
and daughters of those lands are 
strangers to the tongues in which 
their ancestors spoke and sang. 
Each in turn had some of the 
princes of the House of Judah de- 
clare the Gospel of the one God 
unto them, whether they had Jesus 
Christ preach to them or not. Upon 
the ruins of the civilization of 
Greece, the Apostle Paul declared 
unto them the God that the degen- 
erate Greeks ignorantly worshiped. 
Peter proclaimed the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ to the house- 
holds of the Caesars, as doubtless 



Paul did also, and their teachings 
were rejected. But those stiff- 
necked people of the House of Is- 
rael, though they were rebellious 
and received only a part, a law of 
carnal commandments, to be to 
them a school-master to bring them 
to Christ, they were in subjection to 
Egypt, to Babylon and to Rome 
yet preserved their education, lan- 
guage, customs, individuality and 
their name to this very day. The 
Jew, disliked even to this time, driv- 
en, oppressed, scattered and peeled 
still they are the one nation of all 
people who have been preserved 
from time immemorial, because 
they have given themselves, in part 
to the teachings of God. Today' 
before any civilized nation of Eu- 
rope, and possibly America, can de- 
clare war, they must ask the Jew 
the Baron Rothschild and their fel- 
lows, who hold the purse strings 
of the world, in fulfilment of proph- 
ecy which said that they should 
suck the milk of the Gentiles. If 
religion would do this for a people 
on y half understood, and havino- 
only a lower law which was to 
bring them as a schoolmaster to 
Christ, it must appeal to every 
thinking man that a religion having 
as its basis the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the power of God unto sal- 
vation, will best subserve the inter- 
ests of government in the world, 
and preserve its people, and prepare 
them for the reign of peace and 
righteousness when Christ shall 
come with the holy Saints and 
dwell upon the earth. That that 
epoch may be hastened, that we may 
participate in its blessings and re- 
joice with all those who love the 
truth who love liberty, who love 
equality before the Lord, is my 
prayer, m the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER GERMAN E. ELLSWORTH. 

(President of Northern States Mission.) 

It is with feelings of gratitude 
that I stand before you for a few 
minutes to give a brief report of the 
conditions of the work of the Lord 
in the Northern Stajtes Mission. 
We have been wonderfully blessed 
in that part of the vineyard, with 
health and strength and with en- 
ergy to prosecute the labors that 
have been assigned to us. With 
few exceptions, the Elders have en- 
joyed the best of health, and 
through their energetic efforts have 
had the power of the Lord with 
them. In a great measure they 
have realized the responsibility that 
rests upon them. They have made 
an effort to reach all the people in 
their districts, and proclaim to them 
the restoration of the Gospel, and 
call upon all men to repent and 
work works of righteousness in the 
earth, that they may be worthy to 
stand in the presence of God when 
they have left this stage of action. 

In the last two and a half years 
our efforts have turned from dis- 
tributing tracts when making the 
first call to that of presenting the 
Book of Mormon to the people. The 
Book of Mormon was the only book 
used, along with the Bible, as a 
text book for the first eight years 
in the history of the Church, and 
wonderful were the results follow- 
ing its distribution. We have 
placed this record given of God, 
containing the fulness of the ever- 
lasting Gospel, first and foremost. 
It has been placed in the grips of 
the Elders first, and if there was 
any room left, they have put in 
such books as Cowley's Talks, the 
Voice of Warning, the "Durant," 
and some tracts. 



In connection with putting the 
Book of Mormon as our leader, we 
have divided each conference into 
small companies. Each company of 
six or eight going by twos for the 
week, along different routes to a 
common point for a Saturday and 
Sunday conference. At the close 
of all street meetings held by each 
pair, the Book of Mormon was of- 
fered to the people, followed by the 
smaller books and tracts. During 
the past six months the Elders have 
maintained a very high record. In 
the month of August each pair of 
Elders in the mission made an av- 
erage of 38 Books of Mormon, 180 
Cowley's Talks, Voice of Warnings 
and other books. In the same month 
each pair averaged 1,200 tracts and 
30 meetings — the Elders leading in 
Books of Mormon leading also in all 
other lines. The total number of 
Books of Mormon for August was 
2441, other books, 12,177, while the 
tract distribution reached 81,990, 
most of them containing 32 pages. 
Every Elder who has pushed the dis- 
tribution of the sacred record — the 
Book of Mormon — has received a 
wonderful blessing from the Lord. 
One of our conferences had not 
been following the plan proposed, 
because they had not fully under- 
stood, but after holding meetings 
with them they started out to do so. 
Within ten days we received a let- 
ter from the conference president, 
stating, 'We have had bills print- 
ed ; we have divided our conference 
into two divisions, and we are de- 
termined to make your plan, or the 
plan that has been adopted by some 
of the other conferences, a success." 
The Elders accepted what was told 
them, and went forth to prove it 
the right thing, not to demonstrate 
whether it was or not. The spirit 
manifest by this conference in prov- 



74 . GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing the proposed plan inspired of 
the Lord, seems to be the spirit of 
all the Elders laboring- in the 
Northern States Mission. Hun- 
dreds of people have listened to the 
Gospel in that part of the earth, 
and we rejoice greatly in the pow- 
er that the Lord has given the El- 
ders in teaching the principles. We 
rejoice in the success in distribut- 
ing the sacred record that was giv- 
en by the Lord to the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith to help bring the world 
to Christ. President J. A. McRae, 
in talking with some of the breth- 
ren concerning the Book of Mor- 
mon, said, "It is laid upon our 
shoulders to distribute it to the 
world ; it is a message to the inhab- 
itants of the earth, a letter given to 
us to be delivered to the people that 
live in this day and time. If we re- 
ceived a letter to be delivered to 
somebody, and we failed to deliver 
that message, and people were lost 
because of not receiving it, we 
would be held responsible for the 
destruction of those people or for 
the calamity that came upon them." 
We believe that we have felt this 
responsibility, although we have 
not put it in just that language, but 
we have sensed the importance of 
the message of the Book of Mor- 
mon, and have striven earnestly 
and carefully to distribute it among 
the people. We believe that the re- 
sults from its distribution are won- 
derful compared with anything 
that has been done before in the 
Northern States mission, both to 
develop the Elders and to turn the 
hearts of the people towards the 
restored Gospel. 

We rejoice and feel thankful for 
the success that has come to the 
Elders laboring in that part of the 
United States, and for the spirit 
manifested by the people towards us 



and toward the work of the Lord. 

One thing said by one of the 
brethren in the opening of our con- 
ference concerning the environ- 
ment of the home, and the environ- 
ment of the Church, has been in 
my mind ever since it was said. I 
was led to think what a wonderful 
thing environment had worked in 
the hearts of some of the leaders of 
God's people in this day, and above 
all, the wonderful development that 
came to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
because of his environment. I 
thought of the time this summer 
when I was privileged to visit the 
birthplace of the Prophet, Palmy- 
ra, the Hill Cumorah, and the Rut- 
land temple. Several mornings I 
visited the grove in which the 
Prophet Joseph Smith knelt in the 
personal presence of God and Jesus 
Christ; and the sacredness of the 
spot was uplifting to my soul. I 
thought of the Prophet Joseph, just 
merging from boyhood to manhood, 
when the influence and the power 
of environment could work won- 
ders in the life of any person kneel- 
ing in that sacred place, in the 
presence of the heavenly Beings. I 
said to myself, "Oh, that every boy 
might be so influenced at such a 
stage in life." Standing in the 
grove, where, it is said bv the peo- 
ple who live there, the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith beheld the Father and 
the Son, I was moved, and felt what 
a glorious thing it would be for the 
young men and young women of 
Zion, if they, too, could stand in the 
presence of God and Jesus Christ, 
and then grow up under that in- 
fluence. What a great work they 
could perform, how powerful they 
would be in the earth in bringing 
the people to know the true char- 
acter of our Father who is in 
heaven, and of His Son Jesus

Christ. The world has a vague 
idea of some great spiritual force 
that manifests itself in all the phen- 
omena of life, that is everywhere 
present. To the Latter-day Saints, 
all these manifestations are but the 
result of laws operated by our 
Father in heaven, who is indeed a 
personal God. 

After visiting the Hill Cumorah, 
the old homestead, and the wood in 
which these wonderful things were 
explained in the life of the Prophet 
Joseph, I had the privilege of visit- 
ing his birthplace,where now stands 
the monument that has been erected 
to his name. I learned from the 
man who quarried the stone that, 
as far as he could find out, it is the 
largest polished shaft in the world ; 
and I thought how fitting that such 
a stone should be erected to the 
memory of the man who declared 
that he had seen God the Father 
and his Son Jesus Christ, and that 
we are indeed His children. Why 
should we not erect such a monu- 
ment to the honor of the man who 
gave to the world the greatest of 
all truths — the truth by which we 
might gain life eternal. I do not 
believe that the power and influ- 
ence of such a manifestation as he 
received could leave any boy. They 
did not leave him. He stood alone, 
and when the weight seemed great, 
holy angels ministered to him, and 
cleared all doubt .away, and the 
Church of Jesus Christ was estab- 
lished by our Father through him. 

From our earliest recollection 
we, as Latter-day Saints, young 
men and young women, have been 
informed of this great revelation. 
Most of us have had a testimony 
that the Gospel is true ; even before 
we had the language to express it, 
and even before we realized that we 
knew the Gospel was true that tes- 



timony was ours. With such a be- 
ginning, and with the environments 
that ought to surround the Latter- 
day Saints, every young man and 
woman could erect a monument to 
his or her memory that would stand 
eternally, not a monument of stone, 
but a monument most precious in 
the sight of God. 

My heart has rejoiced this sum- 
mer in the things that I have learn- 
ed concerning the history of the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus, in this 
dispensation from the birth of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith to the build- 
ing of the temple at Kirtland. These 
facts, added to my visits to Inde- 
pendence, Nauvoo, and Carthage, 
as well as many spots on the plains 
made dear by the dead buried there, 
has made the Gospel dearer to me 
than it has ever been before. I, in 
common with the Elders in our 
mission, have striven to magnify 
the name of our Father, and to 
erect a shaft of truth that will 
stand throughout all the ages of 
eternity. 

There is a wonderful change in 
the feelings of the people, and 
many things have been making for 
the spread of truth. The argu- 
ments of the elders have counted for 
nothing, but it has been the spirit 
in which they have spoken, and the 
power of the Lord that has accom- 
panied their testimonies, and in the 
distribution of the Book of Mor- 
mon and other literature. One 
more testimony of the Book of 
Mormon and Joseph Smith. It is 
the experience of many an Elder 
when downcast, gloomy and op- 
pressed, that all he needed to do 
was to testify of the divine mission 
of Joseph Smith, or speak of the 
Book of Mormon, and the mist was 
' dispelled, and the power of the 
Lord came upon them, and the} -

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have stood forth grateful to our 
Father in heaven for. the power that 
He has given them over the hearts 
of men. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints, 
and bless the young men and wom- 
en of the rising generation, that 
they may keep burning bright in 
their hearts the spirit of the Gos- 
pel, and by the power of the Lord 
that will be given them be able to 
dispel the darkest clouds, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"Glorious things are sung of Zion." 

ELDER JOSEPH A. M'RAE. 

(President of Western States Mission.) 

I rejoice, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to meet with you this morning, 
and listen to the remarks that have 
been made during this conference. 
My heart has gone out to the young 
people of Zion. 

There have been many questions 
flash through my mind that I have 
been unable to answer. A short 
time ago, in talking with a gentle- 
man who professed to be religious, 
he asked if we had stopped receiv- 
ing revelations. He said : "I don't 
hear of any revelations having been 
accepted by your Church of late 
years, or since the close of the Book 
of Doctrine & Covenants, some 
years ago." I answered, "Of course 
we receive revelations ; we receive 
revelations every day." "But," he 
said, "you don't place those revela- 
tions before the body of the Church 
to be accepted by the Church, as 
directed in the Book of Covenants." 
That remark has led me to reflect 
on the history of this Church, and I 
have been wondering where the 
Church would have been if we had 



to depend upon a congregation of 
the Saints to decide upon accept- 
ing the revelations of God. I was 
trying to think where we would be 
today if it had been left to a coun- 
cil to decide as to whether or not 
the Father and the Son had ap- 
peared unto the boy Joseph Smith 
in the woods as you have heard 
related here this morning by Broth- 
er Ellsworth. What would have be- 
come of the Church, or where 
would the Church be today, if it 
had been left to a council to de- 
cide as to whether Moroni appear- 
ed unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and taught him the things of God, 
and told him that his name should 
be had for good and evil among all 
the nations of the earth? What 
standing in the earth would the 
Church have if it had been left to 
a council to decide as to whether 
John the Baptist came to Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and 
placed his hands upon their heads 
and ordained them to the Aaronic 
Priesthood? Where would we be 
today had it been left to a council 
to decide as to whether Peterjames 
and John appeared unto those men 
and conferred upon them the holy 
Melchisedek Priesthood ? Even the 
date of that event has been lost; we 
do not know the exact time when 
it occurred, and yet, with thanks to 
our Father in heaven, we accept 
the ordination of Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery, magnifying the 
holy Priesthood that has been given 
unto us through them. Of course, 
that Priesthood was conferred by 
holy messengers, the fact was duly 
made a matter of record, but the 
precise date of its occurrence, as I 
have stated, has been lost. And so, 
we might go on from the beginning 
down to the present time. The ap- 
pearance of the various messengers 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE. 



77 



who came to confer the powers of 
Priesthood and authority upon His 
servants in this dispensation, where 
would we be today, I say, if these 
thing's had been left to the decision 
of a council? We might be quar- 
reling' and contending one with the 
other as to the authenticity of the 
various revelations. But we are 
perfectly content; we know that 
those whom God has chosen in this 
dispensation, whom He has or- 
dained, set apart, and directed to 
accomplish His work, have been 
men of God, divinely ordained to 
accomplish the things given them to 
perform. And so, we stand forth 
boldly declaring that God has spok- 
en from the heavens, that He has 
restored the Gospel in this dispen- 
sation, and that the Book of Mor- 
mon is indeed the word of the Lord, 
that it contains the fulness of the 
everlasting Gospel, and we do not 
need to submit these things to the 
decision of a council. All we need 
is to do as our Father in heaven 
has instructed us, go to Him in 
humble prayer and ask whether 
these things are true or not, and we 
have the assurance that we will re- 
ceive a testimony of their truth. 
There are men and women who 
creep into our homes, wards, and 
missions, and seek to lead astray 
the people who have accepted the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
They are leading a few away by 
their sophistry, not saying- harsh 
things against the authorities, be- 
cause they know, perchance, that 
our young people would not listen 
to such things ; but at times some 
of the young are deceived and led 
away from the paths of truth. We 
have had Elders come to us in the 
mission field who said, "We do not 
have a testimony of the Gospel of 
Christ, we do not know that it is 



true; we have come here because 
we have been requested." We have 
said to them, "You do have a tes- 
timony of the Gospel, but you don't 
know it; you nursed the testimony 
of the Gospel from your mother 
when you were infants ; it is a part 
of you, but you have not had it 
awakened yet. When you are in 
the mission field a little while, and 
come in contact with those who op- 
pose you, this germ of truth that 
was born with you, and has grown 
up with you, will be awakened, and 
you will find that you can be a pow- 
er in the world in testifying of 
Jesus Christ, and the mission of 
Joseph Smith and the divine au- 
thenticity of the Book of Mormon." 
And these young men have been en- 
couraged, and they have gone forth, 
and have returned after a while, 
thanking their Father in heaven for 
the testimony which He had given 
them. 

Some time ago a gentleman came 
and asked, "Why do you believe 
this is the Gospel ? and why are you 
a member of this Church?" I said, 
"My answer to that is very brief : 
I belong to this Church, because it 
is the Church of Jesus Christ, and 
that is the reason I am here declar- 
ing its truth unto the people." I 
believe that most of our young peo- 
ple have a knowledge of the Gospel, 
and have a testimony of it, but 
many of them are not aware of the 
fact. Sometimes we are dilatory 
and lazy; we think the Lord is go- 
ing to do all for us. We go to 
school or to the university, and 
the young man or woman who 
wishes to progress, and receive a 
degree, must burn the midnight oil ; 
and yet, to get a knowledge of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ they feel that 
all that is necessary for them to do 
is to ask their Father in heaven, 



78

and, without any effort on their 
part, the Lord will manifest the 
truth unto them. I want to say that 
God requires that we shall seek 
Him earnestly, exerting- the pow- 
ers and faculties He has given us, 
and then will He impart a testi- 
mony of the truths of heaven. 

This great body of Saints who 
are in attendance at this conference 
is a revelation to me. The utter- 
ances of the' servants of the Lord 
yesterday in the tabernacle, and 
this morning, have been revelations 
unto me that we possess the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, the power of God 
unto salvation. I have asked the 
Lord to bless me with testimony, 
that He would give unto me a 
knowledge that we have the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. I have 
not desired that I might be an or- 
ator, that I might stand before an 
audience and, in flowery speech, de- 
clare unto them the principles of the 
Gospel, and reason with them; but 
I have desired that I could bear 
that testimony to my fellow men, 
and that they may be impressed 
with it. And the Lord has been 
merciful and good to me. I see the 
revelations of God, and hear Him 
speak in all of His operations in the 
world. He has been mindful of me 
in this particular, and I feel some- 
times that I cannot be grateful 
enough for these manifestations. 

In the mission over which it has 
been my privilege to preside for a 
few years, the Elders have been 
performing excellent missionary 
work. We are not baptizing many 
people, but we are making thous- 
ands responsible for the testimo- 
nies we bear unto them. Some 
time in the future the testimonies 
that are being borne by the Elders 
will stand as a rebuke unto those 
people if they do not accept the 



Gospel of Jesus Christ. This after- 
noon, the Elders in several cities in 
our mission will stand upon the 
street corners, and will bear their 
testimonies unto the congregations 
that will, assemble. This evening 
they will do the same thing, and 
will declare that Joseph Smith was 
a Prophet of God, and that the 
Book of Mormon is a divine reve- 
lation from our Father in heaven. 
The people will listen to the testi- 
monies that the Elders bear; they 
will have the words told unto them 
that have been proclaimed many 
times in many places, and they will 
go away paying little heed at the 
time unto the remarks that the El- 
ders have made ; yet, in after years 
they will remember the words and 
the speakers who uttered them. It 
is a peculiar fact 'that the people 
whom the Elders come in contact 
with are very much impressed with 
their personality. I have met peo- 
ple who have seen an Elder but 
once, perhaps five or more years 
previously, and they have described 
the Elder with such minuteness that 
I was able to tell his name. The 
Elders have gone to their houses, 
and when they have stepped inside 
they have said, "Peace be unto this 
house;" and it has had a great ef- 
fect upon the minds of the people, 
and the people ask them to come 
back and partake of their hospital- 
ity. A few weeks ago two of our 
Elders were approached by a gen- 
tleman — some of you may have 
read of it in Liahona, the Elders' 
Journal — who said: "I met two of 
your Elders in my home town and I 
treated them in a shameful man- 
ner, and now I have walked seven 
miles to meet you,because I thought 
perchance I might meet one of the 
men, at least, whom I had driven 
away from my home, and I have 



ELDER JOSEPH A. McRAE.

come here for the purpose of ask- 
ing pardon of those whom I treated 
in such a mean and contemptible 
way." The Elders sold him some 
books, and he. went back rejoicing 
that he had met them, and had the 
privilege of shaking their hands and 
giving them a message that they 
might give to the Elders whom he 
had mistreated so before. 

I want to say a few words about 
the little missionary paper that has 
been established. I do not wish to 
appeal to you in any way that 
would make you think that I am 
mercenary, or that I had a feeling 
of commercialism about me. I 
want to tell you what the paper has 
been doing in the mission field over 
which I have the privilege of pre- 
siding. One of the Elders said that 
in the city of Pueblo he had been 
in the habit of leaving in a certain 
public place some tracts almost ev- 
ery day. He said sometimes he 
would find them still there. When 
the publication of the Liahona was 
begun, he laid that little "mission- 
ary" down in the same place, and 
now when he goes back to place 
others there he never finds one of 
them left; it seems to have an at- 
traction for the people, and they 
have taken it and probably read it. 
We have a number of people in the 
city of Denver who are subscribers 
to this paper, some of them work 
in the postoffice department, and 
those men look forward with as 
much eagerness for the coming of 
that little periodical as they do for 
the coming of a letter from home. 
They come to us and talk about the 
articles that have appeared in the 
paper, and say that there are won- 
derful things in it, that they did not 
know our people preached any such 
doctrines, until they saw them 
there. The editor of the Liahona 



has informed us that there are 
about twelve baptisms traceable al- 
most directly to the influence of the 
paper already. The first copy was 
issued on the 6th day of last April, 
and it was begun under trying cir- 
cumstances. We had a great deal of 
opposition in various ways,but today 
the Liahona has a weekly circulation 
of 18,000, which is something phe- 
nomenal. I bear testimony that the 
power of God has accompanied the 
work ; it has been magnified in the 
eyes of the people, and they are 
turning their attention to it, and 
are recognizing in that periodical a 
magazine that has been established 
for good. You will find, my breth- 
ren and sisters, if you take it into 
your homes it will be a factor for 
good to your families, because it 
carries the spirit of the mission- 
ary. It comes from the mission 
field direct. It partakes of the in- 
fluence of the Elders who are la- 
boring in the vineyard, and brings 
it right to your home ; and it is a 
message from your boys and girls 
who are in the mission field today. 
The Lord is blessing and helping 
us, and we are performing a good 
work in that direction. 

I pray that God will continue to 
bless us, and help us to do right, 
that we may ever serve Him and 
keep His commandments, which is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER JOHN G. M'QUARBIE. 

(President of Eastern States Mission.) 

Relying upon the earnest prayer 
that was offered, upon the sympa- 
thy of those present, and upon the 
Spirit of the Lord, I will attempt 
to discharge the obligation resting

upon me, and embrace this oppor- 
tunity of bearing testimony to the 
truthfulness of the Gospel. 

It is rather difficult, in the spring- 
time, when we look out upon the 
fields and behold the vegetation 
breaking through the soil, to dis- 
tinguish between a weed and a vine, 
or between a willow and an oak. 
They all look pretty much the same 
when they first break through the 
soil. And so, too, in looking out 
upon the field of human thought 
and activity, it is hard to distinguish 
the various systems of religion or 
philosophy; that is, it is hard when 
they first make their appearance to 
tell whether they will develop or 
evolve into a fad, a superstition, 
or a religion ; but as the tree grows 
we are able to distinguish the na- 
ture of it. Time and experience are 
sure to reveal the nature of the va- 
rious systems which are organized 
in various communities. So when, 
in the spring- time of the past cen- 
tury, "Mormonism" made its ap- 
pearance amid the great forest of 
isms,_ the ecclesiastical botanists 
unanimously pronounced it a weed 
of a season's growth, which could 
and should be plucked up by the 
righteous. But the frosts of hatred, 
the blighting winds of persecution 
failed to loosen its roots or to stay 
the growth of its branches; and 
now, as it continues to grow with 
the century, and stretches its arms 
out, defying gravitation, it presents 
more the appearance of the sturdy 
oak than of the frail weed. "Mor- 
monism" is either the greatest of all 
the trees growing in this forest, or 
else it is the least ; and while it has 
something of the nature of the oak, 
yet it is unlike any of the trees of 
that forest amid which it grew. It 
is more like that tree which stood in 
the Garden of Eden, not the one 



the fruit of which our mother Eve 
partook, but the tree which was 
guarded by the fiery sword of Cher- 
ubim, if they had partaken of the 
fruit of it they would have lived 
forever. "Mormonism" has out- 
grown its experimental stage, and, 
as has been said, it possesses fea- 
tures which have characterized all 
the great world movements. There 
is in it that inspiration which for 
its source looks to God, and upon 
the part of the people that abiding 
faith which amounts to positive 
comprehension. And where there 
is a combination of these forces, in- 
spiration and revelation upon the 
part of the leaders, and abiding 
faith upon the part of the follow- 
ers, there has been no power in the 
world that could resist the growth, 
the development and the progress 
of such a people. It was a combi- 
nation of these forces which, in 
Moses and the Hebrew children, 
established the commonwealth of 
Israel, which, in Jesus Christ and 
His Apostles, established Christi- 
anity, and which, in Mohammed 
and his followers, established Is- 
lam. And we see to a marked de- 
gree the combination of these forces 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints as it has been es- 
tablished. 

I was impressed by the remark 
of one of our most learned young 
men who had returned from a col- 
lege course in the East. He was 
not blessed with a very strong faith, 
even when he left Zion, and he 
came back impressed with the 
greatness and the learning of the 
world, and with the knowledge that 
he had acquired, and perhaps to 
some degree with the smallness of 
our own communities and the com- 
paratively few people who were en- 
gaged in this great work. Yet in

attending one of our conferences 
and looking out upon that vast con- 
gregation, which represented at the 
most only the captains of Israel's 
hosts, he was able to see back of 
them the branches, the divisions, 
the battalions which were following 
them, and when he witnessed that 
unanimity of feeling, that similarity 
of testimony and expression, and 
that spirit that seemed to pervade 
them all, he said, "There is no 
power on earth that can resist or 
stop such a movement." 

It seems to me that we have ev- 
erything to make us feel encour- 
aged. I am sometimes impressed 
when I return from the great me- 
tropolis of our nation with the few- 
ness of our people, and I sometimes 
wonder why such a handful of peo- 
ple create any special interest in the 
world, why they excite the attention 
of the people of this nation. If all 
the people in Utah should arrive in 
New York tomorrow, or in Phil- 
adelphia, or in Boston, it would 
make no difference at all, any more 
than a little picnic company arriv- 
ing there. And yet, regardless of 
our numbers, whether they have 
been few or great, our power, our 
organization and the spirit and 
genius of this work is being felt 
throughout the world. Not only 
are the predictions of the ancient 
prophets being fulfilled in the great 
panorama that we see moving be- 
fore us in the tops of the Wasatch 
mountains, not only are the pre- 
dictions of some of our modern 
prophets being fulfilled in our ac- 
tions day by day, but there are oth- 
ers who have made predictions con- 
cerning us.. While President Ells- 
worth was talking about some of 
trie places he had visited, I thought 
of a kind of a prediction which was 
made by Governor Ford, in writing 



the history of Illinois. He said: 
"The Christian world has hitherto 
regarded the growth of Mormon- 
ism with a kind of an air of indif- 
ference, but unfortunately, they 
may yet awaken to feel her power." 
"It was not at all improbable 
that within the course of a cen- 
tury some great orator may arise, 
some man gifted like the Apostle 
Paul, who will make the name of 
the martyred Prophet ring even as 
does the mighty name of Christ it- 
self; and it is not improbable that 
Sharon, Manchester, Nauvoo and 
Carthage may become to an after 
generation places of classic interest 
even as Bethlehem, Jerusalem, 
Gethsemane and Mount Calvary to 
the Christians of the present day; 
and, in such an event, the author 
of this history feels degraded by 
the thought that he stands a fair 
chance of having his name attached 
to the wheels of time, and dragged 
down through the generations even 
as has been that of Pontius Pilate, 
because of his official connection 
with the death of the true Messiah." 
"There may be some who would 
desire an immortal name, even 
under such circumstances, but 
I am not one of that number." Ret- 
ribution was no doubt following 
him. He had played the same part 
that Pontius Pilate played, and he 
was wise enough to know that his- 
tory would repeat itself. These 
spots are becoming places of clas- 
sic interest to thousands of people. 
Thousands are visiting the birth 
place of Joseph Smith, while only 
two years ago it was almost impos- 
sible to identify the exact spot of 
his birth, and now the people of 
Vermont, from, the governor down, 
are visiting that place, and are com- 
mencing to feel proud of the fact 
that their state gave birth to a man

who had exercised such an influ- 
ence upon this generation, that at 
least 400,000 people give evidence 
of their gratitude and their admira- 
tion of him, by the beautiful monu- 
ment that has been erected to per- 
petuate his memory. 

Nauvoo, that city that the Proph- 
et loved, that city from which his 
people were driven, none of his fol- 
lowers have been welcomed there 
for years ; in fact the people in those 
sections have been fed on "Mor- 
mon" depredations; but a wonder- 
ful change is coming over the scene. 
Every Sunday, meetings are being 
held there. Perhaps at this very 
time in the Sabbath school children 
are being taught in relation to the 
divinity of the mission of Joseph 
Smith. And there is a great com- 
pany in New York City who are 
undertaking the development of 
that region of country, Hancock 
county, Illinois, and especially of 
Nauvoo, and they are more than 
anxious that the Church should co- 
operate with them in that land. The 
attorney for the company said to 
me, I think it was just the day be- 
fore I left New York, "We have 
discussed this matter, we have 
thought over it often in our coun- 
cils, and we know that that section 
has never developed since your peo- 
ple were driven from it, and we 
fear that it never will until they re- 
turn to it." 

Independence, that spot around 
which our saddest memories and 
our fondest hopes cluster, there is 
a remarkable change of sentiment 
and feeling with reference to that 
section. It was there that the first 
effort was made to publish to this 
generation the revelations which 
our Father had given for our sal- 
vation and development; but the 
feeling of bitterness was so intense 



that they were unable at that time 
to accomplish their purpose. But 
that stream has continued to grow. 
There has been time to test the 
value of these revelations, and to- 
day there is being issued weekly 
from that very point one of the 
strong religious journals of this 
country, and one of the strongest 
publications of the Church, with a 
subscription list close upon 18,000, 
and many of these are reaching 
outside of our own immediate cir- 
cles. There must be now about 700 
subscriptions in the Eastern States. 
This is at least double the number 
of families in that mission, and 
there are many more in proportion 
in some of the other missions. 

Carthage jail, which for many 
years has been occupied by people 
who made their living by telling 
people of the bad reputation of the 
men who were martyred there, and 
trying to glorify those who put 
them to death, is today owned by 
the followers of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, those who take delight in 
telling of the true character of those 
men who were willing to seal their 
testimony with their blood, and also 
the true character of those who as- 
sassinated them. 

Not only is there a change of 
mind in this regard, but also this 
wonderful change of interest in the 
work that we are doing. ' We have 
more liberties today to preach the 
Gospel upon the streets of New 
York City than ever before; and 
just since I have been on this trip 
I have received a letter from the 
president of the New England con- 
ference that they have permission to 
preach anywhere on the streets of 
the City of Boston. This is a priv- 
ilege that we have not had before, 
at least during my administration 
in that section. And while this wave

of enthusiasm on the part of the 
Elders, and wave of interest on the 
part of the people that is manifest- 
ed, especially in the Northern 
States and in the Middle States, 
and in the Colorado or Western 
States mission, has not yet reached 
us to the degree that is manifest 
there, yet there is a marked im- 
provement in our work, that is in 
the results of our work and in the 
interest manifested by the Elders. 
Up to the present time there have 
been about 2,000 more books sold 
during the corresponding seven 
months of last year, and this in- 
crease is largely in the sale of the 
Book of Mormon, this new witness 
for God that has come forth in this 
day and age of the world to be 
joined with the stick of Judah. 

I bear my testimony to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that I do 
know that the Gospel is true, and 
that the kingdom of God has been 
established, and that it is going to 
roll forth in the world until the 
kingdoms of this world become the 
kingdoms of our God, whose right 
it is to reign. And I pray that we 
may all have strength to be valiant 
in the fight, and be able to take part 
in the battle and share in the vic- 
tories of peace, and I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. .Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"O say, what is truth ? Tis the fair- 
est gem." 

Benediction was nronounced by 
Elder James G. Duffin.

ceedings in the Tabernacle.) 

ELDER WILLIAM H SMART 

(President of Uintah Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel 
just now very much in the frame of 
mind that Elder McKay expressed 
himself to be in at the meeting this 
morning, that is, weighed down by 
a feeling of responsibility, in occu- 
pying this position as a representa- 
tive and humble servant of the 
Lord. In voicing such sentiments 
as shall come to my mind I feel to 
trust in the Lord and your sym- 
pathy, faith and prayers for that 
which will be given unto me. I feel 
that we are being very greatly 
blessed in this conference. Indeed, 
it is coming to be a trite and com- 
mon-place saying that each of our 
conferences seems to be better than 
that which preceded. I am glad to 
be able to bear testimony unto you 
that, after having attended all the 
sessions of this conference up to 
the present time, and having listen- 
ed attentively to what has been said 
unto us by the various speakers, 
there has been no principle ad- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



vanced that I have not felt to say 
amen to. I feel thankful to my 
heavenly Father, therefore, that He 
has given me the spirit of this con- 
ference, and I believe that you have 
enjoyed that same blessing, receiv- 
ing a witness of the Spirit that the 
teachings of the brethren have been 
inspired of our heavenly Father. 
Indeed, it has beerr a time of re- 
freshing. 

It may or may not be in place to 
express my absolute concurrence in 
the appointment of Elder Ivins to 
the apostleship. This is in keeping 
with the statement I made, that I 
endorse, with all my heart, the sen- 
timents expressed and the business 
transacted so far at this conference. 
I think, brethren and sisters, that 
this is one of the greatest testimo- 
nies that the Latter-day Saints have 
of the divinity of "Mormonism," 
and the foundation stone of our 
faith, the rock of revelation, the 
avenue through which God makes 
known His mind and will unto His 
servants upon the earth. One of 
the strongest principles of our re- 
ligion, I think, is the nomination by 
the head, and the sustaining, or re- 
jection by the body. The world are 
pleased to say that, through our be- 
ing united in the acceptance of that 
which is nominated by the head, we 
are blindly led, that we are not in- 
dependent, that we do not exercise 
free will and individuality; and 
therefore they urge young "Mor- 
mondom" to throw off this alleged 
yoke of priestcraft, bondage and 
slavery, the slavery of mind and 
spirit. I am sorry to say that the 
adversary, through those deceivers, 
is having power, in some instances, 
to influence our young people 
against the great principles that we 
have espoused. . We do not think it 
is anything out of place that the sun 



rises every morning, 365 days in 
the year, and sets every evening. 
We do not think it is peculiar that 
the trees bud in the spring, and 
shoot forth their leaves, and yield 
their delicious fruits in the fall. We 
do not think it is peculiar that the 
moon accompanies the other plan- 
ets of this constellation regularly, 
from one years' end to another. We 
do not think it peculiar that when 
we throw a ball in the air it returns 
to the earth, by the law of gravi- 
tation or attraction. We do not 
think it peculiar that when we 
throw a body into the water it goes 
beneath the surface, and yet it rises 
afterward to that position that has 
the same density as itself. We do 
not think it peculiar that when we 
take the two elements, hydrogen 
and oxygen, and mix them in prop- 
er proportions, we may form the el- 
ement of water. In other words, 
we do not think it peculiar that the 
universe and all that is therein 
heeds the voice of order and fulfils 
its destiny. When there is right, 
truth, honesty, superlative love at 
the head, unchangeable and unsul- 
lied in character, are you misled? 
When God speaks through the 
Priesthood we are just as cer- 
tain that it is truth as we are that 
it is right and proper for all things 
within the universe to subscribe to 
and follow the laws of nature. How 
beautiful is the thought that the 
Spirit of God possessed by the 
Latter-day Saints is such that we 
can spiritually analyze the counsel 
that is given to us, and, if we are 
living according to the Gospel of 
the Son of God, we can thereby as- 
certain as to whether that which is 
given is true or not. That is the 
Touchstone of truth, therefore, 
when the servants of God proclaim 
the wishes of our heavenly Father, 



ELDER WALTER C. LYMAN.

we are entitled to know whether 
He sanctions that which is said or 

not. . . , 

While we were sustaining the au- 
thorities, this passage of modern 
Scripture came to my mind : "There 
is a law, irrevocably decreed in 
heaven before the foundations of 
this world, upon which all blessings . 
are predicated; and when we ob- 
tain any blessing from God, it is 
by obedience to that law upon 
which it is predicated." I regard 
this as one of the most beautiful 
passages of spiritual philosophy 
that there is in the Scriptures. An- 
other passage also came to my 
mind, a revelation given unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in Kirtland, 
March 8, 1833 : 

"Therefore thou art blessed from, 
henceforth that bear the keys of the 
kingdom given unto you; which king- 
dom is coming forth for the last time. 
Verily, I say unto you the' keys of this 
kingdom shall never be taken from you, 
while thou art in the world, neither in 
the world to come." 

That is, the keys of the kingdom 
that were bestowed upon the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, by the laws 
of our heavenly Father, should not 
only continue with him in this life, 
but in the world to come. 

"Nevertheless, through you shall the 
oracles be given to another; yea, even 
unto the Church. And all they who re- 
ceive the oracles of God, let them be- 
ware how they hold them, lest they are 
accounted as a light thing, and are 
brought under condemnation thereby; 
and stumble and fall,. when the storms 
descend, and the winds blow, and the 
rains descend, and beat upon their 
house." 

Brethren and sisters, if we ob- 
serve the laws of God we can un- 
derstand that the oracles of God 
were given unto the Prophet Jos- 



eph, and that, while he still holds 
the keys behind the veil, those same 
keys were given unto his succes- 
sors. If we do not understand 
this, then we are liable to be over- 
thrown when the rains descend 
and the winds blow, etc. Let us 
endeavor to keep our hearts attuned 
and our eyes open, that we may be 
impressionable to the Spirit of God, 
and be united with His servants up- 
on the earth, that when, in the 
"times of- refreshing," the Lord 
comes we may be counted among 
His jewels. I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

EIDER WALTER C. LYMAN. 

(President of San Juan Stake.) 

I trust that during the short time 
I occupy this responsible position 
I may be blessed with the Spirit of 
the Lord, that my mind may be led 
in such channels as may be profit- 
able to us who have gathered this 
afternoon. I rejoice in the priv- 
ilege I have of living upon the earth 
in this day and dispensation, when 
the Gospel of the Lerd Jesus Christ 
has been restored; and I rejoice in 
the fact that I have been counted 
worthy, with my brethren and sis- 
ters, to receive, through the mani- 
festations of the Lord, a testimony 
of the truth of the gospel. 

When I was laboring in the mis- 
sion field, a number of years ago, 
in the Northern States, I used to 
wonder why it was that the Latter- 
day Saint Elders rejoiced so ex- 
ceedingly in their labors in the mis- 
sion field, and wondered if we 
should ever have the same spirit, 
the same influence, and the same 
peace and happiness in our labors 
at home. Since my return I have 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been called to labor in the ministry 
at home, and I have found that it is 
possible to have that same degree of 
pleasure and happiness in our la- 
bors at home that we have in the 
mission field. I am pleased to say 
that, in my associations with the 
brethren and sisters of the San Juan 
stake of Zion, notwithstanding 
there are many things that are not 
pleasant, I have enjoyed myself 
even, better than while engaged in 
missionary labors abroad. 

I presume that a majority of the 
brethren and sisters who are here 
this afternoon have read in the 
Book of Mormon the statement 
made by one of the writers, quot- 
ing the words of our Savior, in re- 
gard to the city of New Jerusalem, 
that the Gentiles should be called 
to assist the Lamanites, or the seed 
of the house of Israel, in the erec- 
tion and building of that city. I 
have wondered many times how 
this was to be brought about, but, 
since I have been laboring in the 
San Juan stake of Zion, I begin to 
see a little of the preparatory work 
that I think is going to fit and pre- 
pare the seed of Lehi, or the La- 
manites, to peYform this great and 
glorious work that has been pre- 
dicted upon their heads. One of the 
ancient prophets predicted that 
kings and queens should be the 
nursing fathers and nursing moth- 
ers of the seed of Israel in the lat- 
ter days ; and I find that, in a sense, 
this is being fulfilled in the stake 
over which I preside. The govern- 
ment of the United States, which, 
I presume, may be classed with the 
kingdoms of the earth, is estab- 
lishing schools, and there is one in 
our neighborhood that I desire to 
refer to briefly. It is upon the San 
Juan river, among the Navajo In- 
dians, and is costing several hun- 



dreds of thousands of dollars. The 
buildings and surroundings there 
are such that the Indian children 
are being trained under conditions 
that are far more favorable than 
those surrounding the schooling and 
education of the Latter-day Saints 
in that vicinity. They have the lat- 
est modern appliances in everything 
that they are doing, and many of 
the Indians are becoming skilled 
mechanics. There are hundreds of 
them employed by the government 
in farming, in carpenter work, and 
in learning the trades and sciences. 
Many of them are becoming quite 
proficient along these lines, and 
their children are becoming used to 
the conveniences and appliances of 
modern civilization even to a great- 
er extent than we who have been 
more fortunately situated in the 
past. This, to my mind, is one of 
the evidences that the Lord is work- 
ing with this government along- 
these lines, and we who love to la- 
bor among this people rejoice ex- 
ceedingly in this fact. It was my 
privilege about 28 years ago, when 
I was yet a boy, to remove to that 
section, and I lived there for a 
number of years when those Indians 
were not in the condition that they 
are today, when it was hardly safe 
for one to be among them, even his 
life was in danger. At the pres- 
ent time nearly all the men we can 
get to work for us are the Navajoes 
and Utes, and we have quite a num- 
ber of them employed, and they are 
becoming very proficient in the 
work they have to do. They are 
gradually taking hold of the meth- 
ods of civilized countries, and are 
learning to adopt the methods and 
manners of the people among whom 
they live and labor. 

I rejoice exceedingly in this, my 
brethren and sisters. Although 



ELDER WALTER C. LYMAN. 87 



they have not yet attained to that 
degree of advancement in civiliza- 
tion that we feel it wise or proper 
to preach the Gospel among them, 
whenever that time shall come that 
they are fitted and prepared to be 
colonized, to live in homes and 
houses of their own, their natures 
and dispositions are such that it 
would be in my opinion, a very sim- 
ple matter to convert a majority of 
them to the principles of the Gos- 
pel. Some years ago, volunteer El- 
ders went to labor among them, and 
a great number of them were bap- 
tized, but owing to the fact that 
we had no place to colonize 
them, and the impossibility for them 
to live up to the principles of the 
Gospel in the condition under which 
they were living, it was deemed un- 
wise to preach the Gospel among 
them further at that time. But we 
look to see the time, in the very 
near future, when the possibilities 
we have in the section of the coun- 
try where we are living and labor- 
ing will be such that it will be pos- 
sible for them to have homes and 
farms of their own, and the Gospel 
may then be taught to their chil- 
dren as it is being taught to us and 
our children. 

I was quite impressed with the 
remarks of Apostle Heber J. Grant 
in regard to the Word of Wisdom, 
and if I may be inspired by the 
Spirit of the Lord, I wish to say a 
few words on this subject. Many 
years ago, in listening to one of the 
leading brethren speaking upon the 
Word of Wisdom, I remember he 
took up the financial phase of the 
question of our breaking that com- 
mandment, and he made the state- 
ment that he believed that from 
every town, city and village in the 
community there was a stream of 
money going to swell the river 



flowing out of this state every year 
for those things that are forbidden 
by the Lord. Further, he said that 
he did not believe there was a fam- 
ily or household in any ward in 
the whole Church but had contrib- 
uted somewhat to that river of 
money that was flowing from 
among the Latter-day Saints. I 
thought to myself, there is at least 
one family in the Church that has 
never contributed one cent towards 
that stream ; and on my return 
home I made this statement to my 
wife, when, to my chagrin, she ac- 
knowledged that we had one pound 
of tea in the house ; so we had con- 
tributed at least the price of that 
pound of tea to that great river. 
However, I believe there are fam- 
ilies among the Latter-day Saints, 
and many of them, who do not in 
any manner use these things, and 
do not keep them in their homes. 
It seems to me a strange thing that, 
after the many years this principle, 
this law of God, as it is to us at the 
present time, has been taught to us, 
that there are not more Latter-day 
Saints' homes in which tea and cof- 
fee, and those things that are for- 
bidden, cannot be found. I find 
among the young and rising gener- 
ation, where I labor, that those boys 
who are tempted to use tobacco and 
liquor, and other things that the 
Gospel forbids, have not the same 
moral courage, the same moral 
strength, that others have who have 
not acquired those habits; and I 
find that this will apply to those 
who are older in the Church. I be- 
lieve the time will come when the 
Lord wall not look with the same 
degree of leniency upon the viola- 
tion of this commandment that He 
did in former years. Another 
phase of this question that seems to 
me ought to stimulate us in the 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



keeping- of this commandment is, 
that we ought to teach and set a 
proper example before our fam- 
ilies. I have known families that 
were almost model Latter-day 
Saints, and yet some members of 
the family were not able to control 
their appetites in the use of tea and 
coffee ; sometimes grand children of 
people having that appetite fixed 
within them find it almost impos- 
sible to get away from it and keep 
the Word of Wisdom. It seems to 
my mind that, even though men 
and women go without articles of 
food they have been accustomed to 
all their life, even though it might 
shorten our life a day or two, that 
it would be well to get the spirit of 
this work, and leave off those hab- 
its rather than go to the other side 
with our bodies stained with things 
that the Lord has forbidden us to 
use. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the 
Gospel that the Lord has given un- 
to the Latter-day Saints, and I 
bear testimony that the men who 
preside over us are inspired of the 
Lord. They are not tyrannical at 
all, they labor among us in love; 
and I am happy to say that, in the 
stake I preside over, there is not 
among the presiding authorities, so 
fas as I am acquainted with them, 
the slightest feeling of anything but 
union among us all. I pray that 
this feeling and spirit may be with 
all the Latter-day Saints; I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER NEPHI PRATT. 

(President of 'Northwestern States Mis- 
sion. 

I do not know how to give prop- 



er expression to my appreciation of 
the spirit of this conference. The 
Spirit of the Lord has been poured 
out upon our. brethren who have 
spoken, and upon the congregations 
that have gathered together in this 
conference, in a very remarkable 
manner. I feel to thank the Lord 
for the timely instructions that 
have been given this people, from 
time to time, by the Apostles, 
Prophets, and Elders of the Church 
that God has established in these 
last days. To come to this confer- 
ence from that portion of the 
United States where I am on a mis- 
sion, is indescribably sweet to my 
spirit, and praise and thanksgiv- 
ing goes up from my heart to our 
heavenly Father for these great 
blessings. While you at home are 
busy in the various towns and cities 
where you live, the Elders who are 
on missions are going from town 
to town, and mingling with the 
throngs of men that congregate in 
the places of change and exchange, 
attempting to find the "one of a 
city and two of a family" who are 
to receive the Gospel, according to 
the words of Jesus. Many of your 
sons sometimes feel as lonely as 
though they were in a forest, when 
they are upon the streets of some 
of the great cities, surrounded by 
crowds of unsympathizing stran- 
gers. But the Lord sustains them, 
and we are increasing, by the bless- 
ing of God, the friends that used 
to be like "hunting for a needle in a 
haystack," they were so scarce. 
Wherever your sons, the Elders, go 
and put up at a house, we hear re- 
marks of this kind, "If I had known 
they were Mormon Elders when 
they first came to my house, they 
could have got no shelter under my 
roof; but I have discovered that 
they are gentlemen, not only pol-

ished outside, but the honesty and 
innocence shown forth in all their 
actions has attached us to them, and 
never within my. habitation have I 
had more welcome guests than 
the Mormon Elders." We are es- 
tablishing a good reputation also 
with landlords, people who take us 
in for money, and give us a room 
and shelter. The prejudice against 
the Latter-day Saints is giving way 
in the Northwest to a great extent. 
The Oregonian, the greatest paper 
published in Oregon, printed in 
Portland, has to say of us that we 
are worthy of all commendation for 
the part that the Latter-day Saint 
men take in their religion. That 
paper calls attention to the fact that 
men, instead of women, teach in 
Mormon Sunday schools, and they 
teach a consistent theology ; where- 
as, in the Sunday schools in the 
churches of the various sects in the 
Northwest, the teachers arid super- 
intendents of Sunday schools gen- 
erally are women. I notice that 
other papers also are alluding to the 
active participancy of men in the af- 
fairs of religion among the Latter- 
day Saints, and state that it is be- 
cause of the men putting forth their 
strength in this Church that the 
Sunday schools are a success. We 
are selling sacred literature up in 
our country to the Gentiles. I wish 
that you could come to us and feel 
the good spirit that accompanies the 
Elders in their work. 

The spirit of the nation has been 
described today as one of great in- 
difference; but once in a while we 
have things happen like I am now 
going to relate to you. A woman 
said to a Latter-day Saint brother 
residing where my headquarters 
are: "Mr. So-and-So, you have 
been more affectionate in your man- 
ners toward mv little four-year-old 



daughter, and have spoken more 
kindly to her than her father has 
done in all the years since she was 
born. Tell me where you have 
been raised?" He answered, "I was 
born and raised in Salt Lake City." 
^Well," said she, "what are you?" 
"Why, I am a Mormon," he re- 
plied; "my mother and father are 
prominent in the Mormon Church; 
my mother (I think he said) is the 
fifth wife of my father." She 
shrank from him, and said some- 
thing like this : "Don't tell me that. 
I would rather have thought of you 
as being a Chinaman, and belong- 
ing to a Chinese club, than to have 
thought of you as a Mormon, and 
belonging to that people." And 
this is about what he said : "Mad- 
am, you have the appearance of a 
lady, but I have been raised, ap- 
parently, better than you; I have 
been taught to respect the religion 
of any of my fellow creatures, and 
could not sneer at you as you have 
at me, for religious convictions." 
It took the woman so aback that 
she said: "I regret that I spoke as 
I did, and to show you that I re- 
gret it,_ since I have never read any- 
thing in favor of your people but 
everything against them, bring me 
some of your books that I may read 
your side of the question, and I 
will read to show you that I am 
sorry I stepped over the bounds of 
decency in my language to you." 
Honorable and fair ; but she had to 
be rebuked before she knew how to 
behave. Then she received some 
literature of ours. In the mean- 
time this brother had gone off 180 
miles to a mill, and this woman 
wrote in a letter to him : "Your lit- 
erature has taken away from me 
the desire to go to pink teas and to 
associate with frivolous women. If 
there be a God, a true and living 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God, he must be the God that Jos- 
eph Smith has worshiped. Send 
me, if you please, the Book of Mor- 
mon, or tell me where I can find it." 
When she received directions how 
to get the Book of Mormon, she 
sent over to my headquarters and 
purchased one. Then she wrote 
another letter to this man, in which 
she said : "I am all lit up with this 
book, and I believe that no wicked 
man ever wrote it to deceive. I 
wish I knew what to do." Women 
came to her, she said, and inquired, 
"What are you so abstracted about ? 
Why don't you come with us, and 
associate, and call, and return our 
calls, as you used to?" A friend 
came to her and said : "What is it 
that is occupying your mind?" The 
woman replied, "It is Mormonism." 
She was not afraid, when she found 
that "Mormonism" was good, to 
tell her fashionable friends. Then 
this second lady said, "I am very 
much astonished and very much 
disappointed in you, to think you 
could be taken away from every- 
thing you have loved before, for we ( 
haven't seen you lately, and you 
seem to be changed to us." "Lis- 
ten," said this first woman (as I 
shall term her by way of descrip- 
tion for our convenience), and she 
read out of the Book of Mormon 
the account of Christ's appearance 
unto the Nephites. And they cried 
with joy together, and said, "Did 
you ever read anything so beauti- 
ful, and so accompanied with 
power !" Then said the first lady, 
"I want to go to a Mormon meet- 
ing, but it is raining so all the time 
and is so disagreeable ; but I intend 
to go to the meeting, and so, let us 
pray to Joseph Smith's God; we 
will put Him to the test,and I know 
that He will answer us. Come with 
me into my bedroom." And they 



went together, and knelt down and 
prayed, saying: "O Lord, if Mor- 
monism is true, and it is Thy work, 
give us a sign. Let it be that the 
weather shall clear off, that tomor- 
row we may go to the Latter-day 
Saints' meeting ; and let it come to 
pass that the nurse girl that comes 
to stay with my little one may have 
liberty to come here and take care 
of my girl, that I may seek the 
things that are pressing upon my 
mind ; and also this : may my hus- 
band come to me and say, T am 
going away tomorrow,' so that I 
may be free to go to the Latter-day 
Saints' meeting." And it cleared 
off in the night, and in the morning 
the nurse girl came and said, "Mrs. 
So-and-So, I have come to tell you 
that my mother says I am at liberty 
to stay all day with your little girl, 
if you want me." And the man of 
the house came and said: "My 
dear, I am going away today, down 
to Hood river, and I shall not be 
home till tomorrow." Then these 
women began saying to themselves : 
"Did you ever see anything like it? 
What God is it that answered us? 
Have we ever from our girlhood 
days seen a manifestation, such an 
absolute answer to prayer before?" 
When they were going to the meet- 
ing they talked together, and said 
something like this : "Wouldn't you 
like to have described to you the 
God who answered our prayers last 
night ? Oh, that we might find out 
something about him." And they 
went to the meeting, and young El- 
der Gardiner was called on to speak, 
and he talked upon the subject of 
the personality of God, and as he 
talked the power of God came up- 
on him, and his tongue was loosed, 
and the hearts of these women were 
softened, and they said to each oth- 
er, "He is answering the very ques- 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON.

tions that we wanted to know 
about." When the meeting was 
over, they got two of the sisters to 
'Stay with them, and they invited 
two of the Elders to speak to them, 
and they spent five hours in conver- 
sation together. A few days subse- 
quently they came over to head- 
quarters to see the president. They 
told me all these circumstances, 
bearing testimony that they knew 
"Mormonism" was true, and they 
wanted to know what they must do 
to be saved; and I said, "Repent, 
both of you,of every offense against 
God, and be baptized in the name 
of Jesus Christ for the remission of 
>our sins, by one having authority, 
and have the hands of the servants 
of God laid upon your heads, and 
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy 
Ghost." I enquired if they were 
married. The second lady said, 'T 
am not;" but the first lady said, 
"Yes." "Well," said I, "we have 
got to talk to your husband, for it 
is said that we are breaking up fam- 
ilies, and we don't propose to vio- 
late the rights of families ; we never 
baptize a child or a woman with- 
out the consent of the parents of 
the child or the husband of the 
woman." She then commenced to 
cry as if her heart would break, and 
we tried to comfort her. I told her 
that I would speak to her husband, 
but she forbade me. The second 
lady said, "When can I be bap- 
tized?" I said at the regular bap- 
tizing day, next Sunday morn- 
ing at 9 o'clock. And when bap- 
tism day came, we led her down 
into the water with six or seven 
others, and she was baptized. This 
was the lady who was so astonished 
at the other lady, because she was 
taken up with Mormonism. The 
woman that can not come into the 
Church because of her husband is 



thankful to us, and is doing all she 
can to keep faithful and keep the 
spirit that has possessed her mind. 
This is a sample of the work of the 
Elders and the influence of the 
Book of Mormon, but, of course, 
such cases are rare. 

God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. May the Lord pour out 
upon Zion His blessings. May we 
missionaries be strengthened in our 
important labors among the na- 
tions. I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

My brethren and sisters : The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints has a very interesting 
history, and what we have listened 
to from the lips of President Ne- 
phi Pratt is but a small chapter 
of that history. We have existed, 
as a Church for seventy-seven and 
a half years ; during which time 
a great deal has been done, and a 
great deal has been written, con- 
cerning the Saints of these the last 
days; but we are in the same posi- 
tion that the Nephites were many 
years ago, when the Savior ap- 
peared unto them in the Land of 
Bountiful. In order to illustrate 
what I mean, I will read to you a 
few verses from the Book of Mor- 
mon. It is recorded here, in III 
Nephi, twenty-third chapter and 
seventh to the thirteenth verses : 

"And it came to pass that he [that is, 
the Savior] said unto Nephi, bring forth 
the record which ye have kept. And 
when Nephi had brought forth the rec- 
ords, and laid them before him, he cast 
his eyes upon them and said, Verily I 
say unto you, I commanded my servant 
Samuel, the Lamanite, that he should 
testify unto this people, that at the day 
that the Father should glorify His name 



I

in me, that there were many Saints who 
should arise from the dead, and should 
appear unto many, and should minister 
unto them. And he said unto them, 
Were it not so? And His disciples an- 
swered Him and said, Yea, Lord, Sam- 
uel did prophesy according to thy words, 
and they were all fulfilled. And Jesus 
said unto them, how be it that ye have 
not written this thing, that many Saints 
did arise and appear unto many, and did 
minister unto them? And it came to 
pass that Nephi remembered that this 
thing had not been written. And it 
came to pass that Jesus commanded that 
it should be written; therefore it was 
written according as he commanded." 

I have no intention to make any 
remarks in regard to the resurrec- 
tion of the dead among the Ne- 
phites, but I desire to make this 
quotation illustrate the situation we 
are in as a people at the present 
time. Only a small portion of our 
most interesting history has been 
written, and only a small portion 
will ever be written, because so 
many of our Elders who have been 
abroad preaching the Gospel, and 
who could easily have written books 
similar to the autobiography of Par- 
ley P. Pratt, for instance, have writ- 
ten scarcely anything at all. Elder 
Pratt's book is interesting, indeed; 
but, while he wrote a book that is 
still being read by thousands, oth- 
ers might have written in like man- 
ner, embodying their testimonies 
and experiences. This work, how- 
ever,has not been attended to. Many 
who should have done such writing 
neglected it, and their testimony is, 
consequently, not now before the 
people. Your historians, however, 
are doing something now that will 
astonish you at some future day; 
and I now address this congrega- 
tion as if I were addressing the 
whole Church. Should Christ ap- 
pear and speak to us, as He an- 
ciently did to the Nephites, He 



could refer to many important 
events, pertaining to His latter day 
cause on earth,, about which no rec- 
ord has been made. Perhaps He 
might say, "Did not my servant 
Joseph Smith, or my servants Brig- 
ham Young, Orson Pratt, Heber C. 
Kimball and others prophesy so and 
so, while they were on the earth?" 
"Yes, indeed they did," would per- 
haps be the response by some of 
our veterans. "We remember quite 
well that those things were predict- 
ed." "Why, then, were they not 
written ?" might be the next ques- 
tion. 

There has been a great deal of 
neglect, in this Church, in regard 
to the writing of history and per- 
sonal experience. The Church was 
small in the beginning, and Joseph, 
the Prophet, perhaps did not have 
any adequate idea of the future 
magnitude of the Church which he 
founded, as a humble instrument 
in the hands of God, or that it 
should grow to its present dimen- 
sions in a few years ; hence he, ap- 
parently, did not keep a complete or 
unbroken journal. He wrote con- 
siderably at times, but at other pe- 
riods of his eventful life wrote only 
a very little. Consequently his his- 
tory, as it has come down to us, is 
somewhat incomplete; and he did 
not, apparently, attach as much im- 
portance to some of his movements, 
or official acts, as some of us are 
disposed to do today. We can speak 
in the same strain about the life of 
the Savior. What the evangelists 
of old have written about Jesus 
Christ simply whets our appetite 
for more. Every student of the 
New Testament soon finds himself 
possessed of an earnest desire to 
know much more concerning Jesus 
than that which has been written by 
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON.

And so also when we read about 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, the com- 
j ing forth of the Book of Mormon, 
and subsequent events. But we are 
trying to do the best we can at the 
present time to make up for the 
past. The publication of the his- 
story of Joseph Smith of late, with 
a great many foot notes, has been 
read, undoubtedly, by many of you 
with great interest. These foot 
notes that have become so neces- 
sary, on almost every page of the 
books, can but suggest that there 
must be a vast amount of material 
which has not yet been properly . 
compiled into history. And that is 
true. We have, at the Historian's 
office, tons of valuable writings, — 
very valuable books, documents, let- 
ters, reports, statistics, etc, some of 
which belong to the earlier days of 
the Church and some to a later pe- 
riod. Our collection is the result 
of many years of patient labor, and 
an ordinary mortal could easily 
think, in looking at the immense 
pile, that it would be impossible to 
go through it all. The mountain, 
using a figure, looks so high that 
he would not dare to approach it, 
much less attempt to climb it. The 
genuine historian, however, knows 
that he must trace everything to its 
source ; he must surmount all obsta- 
cles ; he must tackle the entire pile ; 
he must reach the pinnacle at all 
hazards and endeavor to look down 
the other side, or he cannot expect 
to be classed as a thorough his- 
torian. Our documents at the His- 
torian's office have gradually in- 
creased year by year, in proportion 
to the growth of the Church; but, 
aside from the natural accummula- 
tion, we have gathered from many 
different lands and climes a great 
number of books, thousands of 
them. We have been doing this 



labor of gathering documents more 
especially during the past fifteen 
years, until we now, as I said, have 
an immense collection of these 
books and documents, which have 
been arranged in years, months and 
days, commencing with the 6th day 
of April, 1830, and coming down 
to the present time, or at least to 
the close of the nineteenth century. 

It is very interesting to note the 
growth of the Church, commencing 
with its incipiency at New York, 
with six members, and then look- 
ing at it today, with its 55 stakes of 
Zion and 21 missionary fields. But, 
notwithstanding the historical ma- 
terial we have at our command at 
the present time, we find there are 
many links lacking to make a com- 
plete chain. Much valuable history 
has been lost. I think, perhaps, I 
was the means of saving from de- 
struction about one-tenth of the 
records in Europe, but in America 
I have not been nearly so success- 
ful. During the exodus from Nau- 
voo, when the Saints were driven 
from their homes, circumstances 
compelled them to leave much of 
their property behind, many heavy 
things that they could not take 
along, and among these many 
books and records. There were 
records of great value, from the 
missions in the Eastern and South- 
ern States, that never crossed the 
Missouri river, much less reached 
the valley. Consequently, we find 
that with all the material we have 
on hand, we are lacking a great deal 
to fill up the gaps. 

In writing a detailed history of 
the Church, as we are now endeav- 
oring to do, we desire information 
about every settlement, every stake, 
and every ward, and also something 
about every quorum of the Priest- 
hood, and auxiliary organization. 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



We find it a very difficult task to 
obtain some information that we de- 
sire. But after we have obtained 
all we can from public records, and 
after we have put to the best pos- 
sible use all fragments of records 
from the different stakes of Zion, 
particularly the older stakes, and 
gathered together all the books that 
we can from the different mission- 
ary fields, there is at least one 
more class of indispensable records 
required, and it is concerning this 
class that I appeal to you today ; we 
wish you to help us to procure it. 
Listen ! Many of you are sons or 
or grandsons, daughters, or grand- 
daughters of members who figured 
prominently in the early days of this 
Church. Brother Pratt, who has 
just spoken to us, is a son of one 
of the most illustrious men that 
figured in our early history, and 
there are in this congregation to- 
dry, not to speak about the whole 
CTurch, a great many descendants 
from just such noble parentage. 
Many of you are, undoubtedly,with- 
out your knowing it, in possession 
of historical knowledge.in the shape 
of old papers and documents that 
you may think are not worth any- 
thing at all, but which would, in the 
hands of the historian, fit in beau- 
tifully in some of these gaps that 
-I have been referring to. We have 
evolved a somewhat original sys- 
tem, a natural system, so perfect, so 
complete, and yet so simple in its 
scope and arrangement, that there 
is scarcely a document that you 
can produce, or a book or record of 
any kind which may be procured, 
that will not fill up a gap in some 
conference, branch, ward, stake, or 
ouorum or organization of the 
Church. Hence, we appeal to you, 
my brethren and sisters throughout 
the whole Church, that you will 



gather together such remnants- 
old letters and documents — from 
the days of your grandfathers and 
grandmothers, and that you will 
lend them to us at the Historian's 
Office, that we may read them and 
cull from them such information as 
we need. Of course, we do not 
know what use we can put them to 
until we see them, but, much that 
some of you may deem worthless 
may by us be found very useful in- 
deed, as it may fit in nicely some- 
where and help in making a com- 
plete history of our people. And 
not only that, but, by co-operating 
with us, you may be the means of 
placing your fathers and mothers, 
and your grandfathers and grand- 
mothers, on record. Furthermore, 
the private documents may enable 
us to bring forth, as it were, from 
oblivion many choice testimonies, 
similar to those related by Brother 
Pratt today. My brethren and sis- 
ters, will you comply with our re- 
quest? Will you carry this mes- 
sage home with you? Will you go 
to your different settlements and 
spread this call among your neigh- 
bors, and search here and there 
for the material that we desire so 
much ? 

The Book of Mormon, to which 
I have referred, is a very precious 
document, precious even from a 
historical standpoint. I admit that 
I may, perhaps, look upon that book 
a little differently to some of you. 
Some of you may love and admire, 
to a very great extent, the doctrines 
contained therein, and so do I ; but, 
when I was a little boy and read 
the Book of Mormon the first time, 
I skipped over a great many doc- 
trinal parts, and long sermons, that 
are contained in it, such as King 
Benjamin's discourse, the instruc- 
tions that Alma gave to his sons 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON. 



95 



and many similar things, because 
they were not so interesting - to me 
as some other parts were; but, be- 
ing, perhaps, a natural historian 
from my early youth, I read and 
re-read the historical parts of the 
book with particular interest, and I 
came to the conclusion that the 
Book of Mormon was the most in- 
teresting book I was ever permitted 
to peruse when I was a boy. I have 
not changed my ideas very much 
since. Do you realize what that 
book is to you and yours, as Latter- 
day Saints, and what it would be 
to the whole world, if they would 
accept it? Do you know that, if it 
was not for the Book of Mormon, 
this western half of the world, in 
which we live, would have no writ- 
ten history for about 4,000 years ? It 
is no secret among the Latter-day 
Saints that the Garden of Eden 
was located on this land. Hence, 
we can claim as a part of our his- 
tory the first chapters in Genesis. 
But, when Noah built his ark, and 
that floated during the deluge 
nearly half way around the world, 
and landed somewhere on the 
mountains of Ararat, in Asia, the 
history of the world, as given us by 
the Jewish historians, was transfer- 
red to the eastern hemisphere. From 
that time to the days of Christo- 
pher Columbus, when .he sighted 
San Salvador, off the coast of 
North America, the western world 
is almost entirely lost to history, so 
far as eastern writers are con- 
cerned. They tell us next to noth- 
ing about America. But, in the 
Book of Mormon we have a history 
extending from the days of the tow- 
er of Babel to the time that the fam- 
ily of Lehi left Jerusalem, 600 years 
before the birth of our Savior. Thus 
a period of about 2,500 years is cov- 
ered by the history of the Jaredites. 



Then, taking up the history from 
the time Lehi left Jerusalem to the 
destruction of the Nephites, we 
have the accounts of another thous- 
and years, which brings us down to 
the year 420 after the birth of 
Christ, and the historical narra- 
tive in the Book of Mormon leaves 
the Lamanites in very much the 
same condition that Christopher Co- 
lumbus found them in, over a 
thousand years later. Thus you 
will understand, my brethren and 
sisters, that the Book of Mormon 
is about the only historical docu- 
ment we have at the present time 
of this great western world? The 
eastern world has the Bible; it also 
has Josephus ; it had Greek and 
Roman historians, and writers of 
other nationalities who left on rec- 
ord many precious books, telling 
us all about the eastern world. But 
the western world is minus such his- 
tories, and must acknowledge a 
great lack of historical documents. 
This is, perhaps, in a great meas- 
ure due to the fact that the Span- 
iards, in the sixteenth century, tried 
their best to destroy all records and 
documents, and all information 
that the Aztecs and other Indian 
nations possessed in relation to their 
ancestors and their ancient history. 
But, thank God for the Book of 
Mormon, it revives the whole mat- 
ter. It tells, briefly, it is true, a 
story that at once could be accepted 
by scientists, philologists and all 
other men who would investigate 
it. Every year brings to our knowl- 
edge something that corroborates 
that book as a true historical docu- 
ment ; we learn more and more 
about the cliff dwellers, the mound 
builders, the tribes of Central or 
South America and Mexico ; and 
everything thus produced goes to 
prove that just such a people as the

Nephites at one time lived in this 
land. 

Two weeks ago today, we could 
have celebrated the eightieth anni- 
versary of the delivery to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith of the plates 
from which the Book of Mormon 
was translated ; I wonder how many 
of you remembered the day. We 
have scarcely commenced yet to cel- 
ebrate anniversaries of important 
events in the history of the Church, 
but perhaps we will do so more 
frequently in the future, when the 
Church has grown a little older. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, 
will you kindly remember what I 
have said in regard to our modern 
history. I have alluded to the Book 
of Mormon in order to show how 
valuable that book is to us as a his- 
torical document, not to speak of 
the glorious doctrines and proph- 
ecies which it contains. But our 
own history is necessarily more in- 
teresting and valuable to us than 
""he history of any other people ; not 
only interesting but necessary, from 
the fact that out of the Church of 
Christ, to which we belong today, 
shall, in due course of time, grow 
the kingdom of God. When the 
time comes that Christ shall reign 
upon the earth, as King of kings 
and Lord of lords, it will, most as- 
suredly, give the citizens of that 
kingdom a great deal of satisfac- 
tion to look back upon the history 
of that persecuted people who 
struggled so hard, as we have done, 
to establish the Church of Christ 
on the earth. They will read, with 
deep interest, the history of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in Missouri, in Ohio, 
in Illinois, and of the early days in 
these valleys. The little handful of 
Latter-day Saints who labored and 
traveled, in the midst of all the op- 
position and persecution that bitter 



foes could invent, to establish this 
Church, will be great heroes to 
them. . Let us also remember that 
many of us who now live, even if 
we did not take an active part in the 
very beginning, nevertheless are 
numbered among the founders or 
early workers in this great Church, 
and this great kingdom that shall 
finally usher in the glorious mil- 
lennium. 

Let us do what we can to honor 
our fathers and mothers and our- 
sdves ; let us place them and our- 
selves on record ; let us make those 
who brought us into the world 
speak, even if they are dead, by 
bringing their books and records 
forth that they may be transcribed. 
With modern facilities for writing 
and copying, we can now write a 
hundred words much easier than 
we could ten words a few years ago. 
Thus we can afford to make copies 
of your old records ; and if you will 
only produce them, and let us have 
the use of them a short time, we 
will show you something as the re- 
sult of our labors that will cause 
your hearts to leap with joy. God 
bless you, I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



EIDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRDT. 

My brethren and sisters : I am 
requested to speak a few words be- 
fore the benediction is pronounced. 

In common with others of the 
brethren who have borne their tes- 
timonies during this general semi- 
annual conference, I can say that 
I have been exceeding happy, and 
have been thankful to my Father in 
heaven that my spirit has been in 
harmony with the counsels and 
teaching that have been delivered

to the people by the servants of the 
Lord. 

One of the peculiarities of the 
Latter-day Saints is their belief in 
Divine revelation. It has been 
stated in this meeting- this after- 
noon that we are believers in the 
revelations of the Almighty, and 
that there is necessity for the word 
of the Lord to come unto the peo- 
ple in these latter times as in for- 
mer ages. I sometimes wonder that 
there should be so much doubt in 
the minds of the people concerning 
divine revelation, when we think of 
th: marvelous advances that are 
being made scientifically among the 
nations of the earth. It is possi- 
ble now, so we are told, (while we 
may not comprehend the principle 
altogether by which this thing that 
I have in mind is accomplished, I 
suppose we have no doubt that it is 
being accomplished), that messages 
are sent through the air without any 
means of transmission that we can 
see, through the agency of what is 
termed wireless telegraphy. All 
that the most of us know about it is 
that there are delicate instruments 
that are so in tune with each other 
that, by some mysterious means, 
when an instrument is touched here, 
afar off, hundreds of miles away, 
there will be a response with an- 
other instrument that is - in harmony 
with the first, and the message will 
be received and understood. Some- 
thing akin to that is also said in re- 
lation to musical instruments, that 
where two musical instruments are 
in perfect accord with each other, if 
a note be sounded on one, another 
instrument in the same room, if in 
exact harmony, and responsive to 
the note, will make reply. Is it not 
possible, my brethren and sisters, 
when we see these things transpir- 
ing among the children of men, to 



believe that we can be so in har- 
mony with our Father in Heaven 
in our spirit, in our thoughts, that 
we can receive and recognize the 
message of the Almighty when the 
voice of the Master speaks through 
His servants? There is, or should 
be, a responsive key or spirit within 
our own souls that should be in 
perfect accord with that that is di- 
vine. I believe in this doctrine 
with all my soul. I do not only 
believe that the manifestations of 
the power of God and the inspira- 
tion of His Spirit has rested upon 
those who have occupied prominent 
and presiding positions in the 
Church, but that it has been with 
the people of the Lord generally. 

I could not help but recall, this 
afternoon, when the name of Broth- 
er Anthony W. Ivins, the President 
of the Stake in Mexico, was named 
as an Apostle, that, years ago, 
there came into my own soul this 
very spirit to which I refer. I re- 
member at one time when I was 
afar off in the missionary field, 
reading of the appointment of 
Brother Ivins to preside in Mexico ; 
as I read there came over me the 
spirit of inspiration, and whispered 
to my soul that the time would come 
when Brother Ivins, who was then 
called to break up his home and go 
afar off into an adjoining republic, 
among a people that could hardly 
be deemed desirable,when he would 
much rather, I imagine, have re- 
mained with his own people, he, 
nevertheless, broke up his home, 
sold his possessions and, at the call 
of the authorities of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
cheerfully undertook the accom- 
plishment of the work allotted to 
him, — I say, as I read of these 
things, and thought and pondered 
over the sacrifices that he was will-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing to make, there came into my 
soul the testimony that God would 
yet call him to the ministry of the 
apostleship. 

A few years ago, probably seven 
or eight years, in journeying with 
one of the Apostles, on a trip 
south, I spoke to him in relation to 
this impression of the Spirit that 
had come to me. I was beginning to 
wonder whether I had been rightly 
impressed, as a number of vacan- 
cies had occurred in the apostleship 
and had been filled, and still Broth- 
er Ivins was not chosen. To my as- 
tonishment that Apostle either took 
a little journal from his pocket and 
read to me, or related to me, I am 
not sure which, but I believe that he 
read it from his journal, that one 
of the great pioneers of this coun- 
try, one of our statesmen, who was 
also one of our noted apostles, the 
"father of the southern country," 
Apostle Erastus Snow, many years 
ago, in the days of the boyhood of 
this brother who has been chosen to 
the apostleship, prophesied that the 
t ; me would come when he would be 
called to this very position, and 
stand in the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles. Men may laugh and sneer 
and doubt the possibility of the in- 
spiration of the Holy Ghost, and 
the revelations of the Almighty that 
come to man, but in my soul, and in 
the souls, I trust, of those who are 
gathered together in this congrega- 
tion, who have taken upon them the 
name of the Lord Jesus, there has 
come answer to prayer, there has 
come understanding in relation to 
the truth, there has come the reve- 
lation of the Lord God of heaven 
to us, that this work to which we 
have set our hands is the very pow- 
er of God, the work of the Al- 
mighty. I thank the Lord for it. I 



thank God for the testimony I have 
of the truth. And I do know the 
truth ; I know that this people have 
been established in these latter days 
ly the revelation and command- 
rLent of the Almighty, and that the 
predictions spoken through the 
mouths of the old prophets in rela- 
tion to the marvelous work of the 
latter days are being brought to 
pass. The work we will accom- 
plish hereafter will continue to be 
a fulfilment of the sayings of the 
prophets, and nothing can stay it. 
God has promised it. God has set 
His hand to accomplish this work, 
and He has said concerning those 
who may oppose it, that the wis- 
dom of the wise shall perish, and 
the understanding of the prudent 
shall be brought to naught, while 
the Lord of heaven continues in 
the accomplishment of his strange 
and wonderful work. These prom- 
ises relative to the latter days will 
all be wrought out in the Lord's 
own time. There is power with 
God to decree and to fulfil His de- 
cree, and there is no power in the 
nations of men to thwart the de- 
cree that God has made. And in 
this we are strong. In this we are 
mighty, though we may be classed 
among the weak things of the 
world, we are nevertheless doing 
the thing appointed unto us of God, 
and the Lord will carry it through. 
This is my testimony, and I rejoice 
in it. I bear it to you in fear and 
trembling, in a sense, and yet with 
an unutterable joy, a joy that passes 
all understanding. I know that 
God has established His work, and 
that in this Church there can be 
found the doctrines and the power 
of God to salvation. May God help 
us to believe it, and to indicate our 
belief by practicing the things that

have been revealed, is my prayer, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Temple choir sang the an- 
them, "But in the last days it shall 
come to pass." 

Benediction was pronounced by 
Elder Rudger Clawson. 



Third Overflow Meeting. 

In the Barratt Hall at 2 p. m., 
President Seymour B. Young pre- 
siding. 

A quartet, "Dear Refuge," was 
sung by Elders Horace G. Whit- 
ney, George D. Pyper, Edward P. 
Kimball and John D. Spencer. 

Praver was offered by Elder Ed- 
ward H. Snow. 

The congregation sang the hymn, 
"How firm a foundation, ye Saints 
of the Lord." 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY. 

(President of Millard Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, the ses- 
sions of the conference that it has 
been my privilege to attend thus far 
I have enjoyed most thoroughly. I 
have rejoiced in the spirit of the 
conference, in the blessing of the 
Lord that has accompanied our 
brethren who have borne testimony, 
and spoken to us, and I sincerely 
hope that, for the few moments it is 
my duty to appear before you, I 
shall be remembered by you in your 
faith and prayers, that the Lord 
may assist me. I have absolutely 
formulated nothing in my mind in 
all the anxiety that I have experi- 



) A. HINCKLEY. 99 

enced in the last two hours, since 
this meeting was appointed, but I 
have felt in my heart that, if I could 
do nothing more, I could bear an 
honest testimony to the truthful- 
ness of the work of the Lord. 

I have been called to labor in the 
Millard Stake of Zion, over a most 
excellent people; and, as I was re- 
marking to one of the brethren yes- 
terday, we feel that we cannot help 
but accomplish good when, out of 
a Church population of about 4,700 
souls, in the Millard Stake of Zion, 
we have 2,000 who bear the Holy 
Priesthood, a majority of whom are 
faithful and true in the discharge of 
their duty. In a calculation that was 
made some three weeks ago, by 
members of the Stake Presidency, 
we felt we could safely report that, 
in the Millard Stake of Zion, all the 
officers, including the presidency, 
high council, alternate high council- 
lors, and those who preside over the 
various auxiliary associations of 
the stake, the Bishops, their coun- 
selors, and those who work in or- 
ganizations in the various wards of 
that stake of Zion,numbering 1,700, 
are honest and faithful tithe pay- 
ers, and all are observers of the 
Word of Wisdom, so far as tea, to- 
bacco and alcoholic drinks are con- 
cerned; not one but has full faith 
in the Gospel. I say that, with that 
force of brethren and sisters, of 
that sterling quality and manner of 
life, and such faith in the Gospel, 
we have felt we could not help 
but succeed in the work that the 
Lord has called us to perform. 

The great duty that rests upon 
the Latter-day Saints is, not so par- 
ticularly in declaring the word of 
the Lord, but it is living the Gospel 
as we have received it. It is not suf- 
ficient that a child should learn to 
repeat, "Blessed are the pure in 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



heart, for they shall see God," but, 
the proper impression to be given 
to the child should be, when they 
learn that beautiful saying is, "I will 
be pure in my heart, that I may see 
God." It is not sufficient that they 
should learn, "Thou shalt not lie," 
but that they should feel in their 
hearts, I will not give myself to de- 
ception of any kind. Every princi- 
ple that is taught should become 
active in their every-day life. It 
is not sufficient that our children 
should hear their father and mother 
in family prayer, kneel down and 
pray for the authorities of the 
Church, but that they should also 
hear father and mother in their 
conversation upholding and sus- 
taining the authorities, and yielding 
obedience to the counsel and in- 
structions that come unto them 
through that source. It is not suf- 
ficient that a father or mother read 
the Word of Wisdom, contained in 
the eighty-ninth section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. They will not 
be excused before the Lord, when 
they tell their children that it is the 
word of the Lord, and at the same 
time those parents sit down and 
drink tea or coffee ; I consider that 
the sin is greater than merely trans- 
gressing the word of the Lord in 
that particular. There are the chil- 
dren ; they hear that read as a rev- 
elation of the Lord unto His people, 
and then they discover that their 
father or mother pay but slight at- 
tention to that revealed word. I 
take it that, when the child hears 
other things that the Lord has 
spoken, their inclination also will be 
to treat that lightly, if they 
have discovered that tendency in 
their father or mother. The re- 
sponsibility of living the Gospel is 
greater than the responsibility of 
„ simply hearing and professing. The 



effect of living is greater for good 
upon those with whom we are as- 
sociated, than simply hearing that 
which we have to say of the Gospel. 

I thank the Lord when I dis- 
cover in the world the good exam- 
ples that we occasionally meet. I 
thank the Lord that it was my good 
fortune to have been born of good- 
ly parents. I never forgot the les- 
sons of a good mother. When days 
of hardship came upon my father, 
I remember the lessons mother 
taught her boys. I happen to be 
the son of the second wife in a 
polygamous family, and I say, to 
the credit and the honor of my par- 
ents and also of my aunt, his first 
wife, that, in our household, I hard- 
ly knew which was my mother, for 
my aunt was as devoted and atten- 
tive in her care for my mother's 
children, it seemed to me, as she 
was for her own. In the days when 
hardship came upon our family, 
and father was away from home, 
I remember that mother came, af- 
ter we went to bed at night, and 
taught us, and said, "You boys 
ought to be thankful for the com- 
fortable bed that you rest in;" and 
she would tell us of the many who 
were not so blessed. She would tell 
us of the authorities of this Church, 
and of the great sacrifices they had 
made and were making, until it be- 
came second nature to me, when I 
met the servants of the Lord, to 
have a very high regard for them, 
to look upon them as Prophets, 
Seers and Revelators. I praise my 
mother today for those early im- 
pressions, and feel that they are 
worthy of commendation to all par- 
ents. 

It has been my privilege to bear 
my testimony to those who are not 
of our faith. I have been delighted 
in this conference to meet numbers 



ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW.

of those to whom it was my priv- 
ilege to proclaim the Gospel, and to 
find in them the same love of the 
truth that was first engendered in 
their hearts when they heard the 
glad tidings of great joy. One good 
sister, when she spoke to me said, 
"My brother, while I am delighted 
to be gathered up to Zion, I hope 
that I shall be given your faith and 
prayers, for my trials are many. I 
do not find among all of my breth- 
ren and sisters the exemplary life 
that I had hoped to discover." Not- 
withstanding, this good sister had 
been taught faithfully by Elders 
that, when you gather to Zion, you 
should not look for perfection. They 
have sung of the time when they 
would come to Zion, to learn of the 
ways of the Lord and walk in His 
paths, and no matter how thor- 
oughly they have been warned, 
when they gather here, if they dis- 
cover coolness and indifference, it 
is a severe trial to them. I hope, 
my brethren and sisters, that we 
may sense the responsibility that is 
upon us, of living worthy the name 
of Latter-day Saints. Our every- 
day acts should preach the Gospel, 
and bear testimony of our sincer- 
ity, that we might have the confi- 
dence of our brethren and sisters, 
showing that our lives are charac- 
terized by humble spirits, and devo- 
tion to the work of the Lord. 

I desire to bear testimony to a 
knowledge that we are engaged in 
the work of the Lord. I have not 
been privileged to see any marvel- 
ous manifestations connected with 
the work of the Lord, only as I 
have seen it progress, but the Lord 
has made manifest unto my soul the 
divinity of this work. He has made 
manifest unto me that development, 
comfort, and blessings come unto 
all those who are faithful, and that 



disappointment comes unto those 
who prove derelict in their duty. 

May the Lord help us to be faith- 
ful, that we may cherish a love for 
the truth; and while we may seek 
the favor of the world, that we 
shall never sacrifice principle, but 
that we shall declare the truth by 
word and deed every moment of 
our lives, serving the Lord with 
full purpose of heart, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW. 

(President of St. George Stake.) 

I have been thinking, my breth- 
ren and sisters, during my attend- 
ance upon this conference, that we 
live in a momentous age; and at 
this particular period of our history 
we are, as a people, both in this na- 
tion and in. the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, making 
very important history. We live 
under the leadership in political life 
of a very strenuous President. As 
members of the Church, we are liv- 
ing, in our religious affiliations and 
obligations, under an equally stren- 
uous leader. Pessimists have nearly 
all turned optimists, and patriotism, 
nationally, has been aroused. Our 
faith in the nation's leaders springs 
almost spontaneously in our hearts. 
We believe that, generally, they are 
just men, that they have the wel- 
fare of the nation at heart. They 
have seen dangers that the ship of 
State was liable to be wrecked upon 
and have grappled with the great 
problems of our day with a firm- 
ness and integrity that challenges 
love, admiration, and support, re- 
gardless of our affiliations or be- 
liefs. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that, while that condition 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



obtains in civil affairs, it is empha- 
sized and marked to a greater de- 
gree, perhaps, in our spiritual life, 
in our connection and membership 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. It is not nec- 
essary, I believe, with the great 
mass of the members of the Church, 
to preach confidence in the authori- 
ties of the Church. Their acts, lives, 
labor, integrity, and the good re- 
sults which come from following 
the counsel of those men, all bring 
from us, without restraint, our love, 
respect, and unfaltering support. 
We are animated and sustained by 
a determination to do our duty, to 
be faithful and true. These are aus- 
picious signs of strength, and unity, 
and I say, my brethren and sisters, 
that we are fortunate in living in 
these days. We are fortunate in 
living when there are so many who 
are faithful and true, and when we 
behold the progress, uplifting, and 
spreading abroad of the Church 
and its people. We are also grati- 
fied as members of that Church, 
and rejoice in the goodness of our 
Father, that He has lifted the veil 
of prejudice that has surrounded 
the nations with reference to our 
people. Not an Elder has gone into 
the world but has suffered in his 
feelings when he has stood upon the 
streets of the great cities, or in the 
house of the prejudiced man or 
woman who has been filled with 
lurid tales concerning the "abom- 
inable Mormons." He has felt in 
his heart to pray, "O Lord, how 
long shall we suffer from the ignor- 
ance of the world regarding the vir- 
tues, aims, and purposes of our peo- 
ple?" Thank the Lord for the 
changed sentiment; I feel that we 
are becoming better known every 
day. 

It is perhaps a good thing, al- 



though at times we have questioned 
it, that we are surrounded on all 
sides by the civilization of the 
world. We have felt sometimes as 
though it would be a question with 
us as to which would survive re- 
ligiously, we or they; whether we 
should leaven the whole lump, or 
whether we should be influenced al- 
together too much by them and 
their customs. But, to the Latter- 
day Saint who has been faithful and 
true, and who has a testimony and 
knowledge of this Gospel, there has 
never been any question as to the 
ultimate outcome. We must be 
tried in all things; our faith must 
be tried. We must rise triumphant 
over the temptations of our day. 
We must love righteousness for 
its own sake, and virtue for its 
own reward. That being the case, 
there is no question of ultimate vic- 
tory. Being on the highway where 
travel has been through our midst, 
where the great of the land, edi- 
tors, statesmen, and politicians have 
come among us, have seen us in 
our homes, have witnessed our 
lives and labors, the people of these 
United States can no longer be 
made to believe that we are what 
our enemies have represented for 
the past fifty years. Our reputa- 
tion is fast merging from the clouds 
of misrepresentation, our true char- 
acter, that of a God-fearing, right- 
eous and uplifting people, is becom- 
ing known, and this has been 
brought about through the benign 
influence of the Gospel of our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ. We 
ought to be thankful that we have 
been born in these valleys, in the 
midst of these mountains, where the 
environment has been pure physi- 
cally and morally. We ought to be 
thankful for the sweet and uplift- 
ing influences of the Gospel upon 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

our lives. I believe that we are 
thankful; and ]ust in proportion to 
the heartfelt expressions of grati- 
tude we offer to our Father, do we 
manifest that we appreciate these 
blessing's day by day. 

I pray the Lord to bless us as a 
people, to bless the Presidency and 
other authorities of the Church, and 
the people, that we may see eye to 
eye. That we may labor together, 
unselfishly and harmoniously, for 
the redemption of Zion, for the 
spreading of truth, for the setting 
up of the Church and Kingdom of 
God upon the earth, that His pur- 
poses may be fulfilled, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 

I am pleased, my brethren and 
sisters, to meet with you this after- 
noon. Of course, you are disap- 
pointed that vou were not able to 
secure seats in the large Tabernacle, 
or perchance in the Assembly Hall. 
There are only a few of us here, 
but we are nevertheless entitled to 
an outpouring of the Spirit of the 
Lord upon us. That is His prom- 
ise, when even a few meet together 
in His name He will be there, and 
that to bless them. My experience 
has been that, in some of the small- 
est meetings I have ever attended, 
I have enjoyed and witnessed a rich 
outpouring of the Spirit of the 
Lord. I trust we shall enjoy the 
same good Spirit that has charac- 
terized the instructions, admoni- 
tions, and words of encouragement 
we have received throughout the 
meetings of this conference. 

I was reading in the Deseret 
News, this morning, a report or 
interview that was sent out from 
this city to the Indianapolis Star. 



There are a few words of the excerpt 
that were printed in last evening's 
News that I wish to call attention 
to. We do not notice all the evil 
things said against us, just as a self- 
respecting man will not deign to 
pay attention to every small dog 
that may snarl at his heels ; but oc- 
casionally, when we read a report 
that is a type of misrepresentation, 
we feel justified in calling attention 
to it. The words of this interview 
or report that I specially wish to 
call attention to are as follows : 
"They," meaning the Latter-day 
Saints, "do nothing until the priests 
direct them. You would not be- 
lieve how subservient these poor 
Mormons are. Mostly from the Eu- 
ropean slums, they are naturally 
serfs. They know nothing but to 
be dominated." It may be that the 
gentleman who sent out a report, 
or interview, of that kind, actually 
believes what he says to be true. 
Emerson, the philosopher, from 
whom Elder Whitney quoted yes- 
terday, says, "Nothing shall warp 
me from the belief that every man 
is a lover of the truth." That is the 
general rule, men and women love 
the truth. I sometimes feel that, 
patient as we are in standing abuse 
that may be heaped upon us, after 
all, we may not be patient enough, 
perhaps we are not as forgiving 
and charitable in all instances as 
we should be, because those who 
traduce us may be among- that uni- 
versal class Emerson speaks of 
who love the truth. 

I was thinking, in reading this 
excerpt today, how the whole his- 
tory of the "Mormon" Church dis- 
proves the truth of every statement 
that is contained in those words I 
have read to you. In the first place 
the "Mormon" converts were for- 
merly members of other Christian 



104

churches. They had espoused dif- 
ferent religions and denominations 
of the Christian world, and in order 
for them to join the Church, they 
had, in the first place, to break the 
ties that were already established 
between them and the churches to 
which they belonged. It required 
independence and individuality to 
do this. If there was not a test thus 
early in their experience, as pro- 
posed converts to the "Mormon" 
Church, they very soon afterwards, 
in most instances, experienced some 
other trying test. It came to indi- 
viduals in different ways. To the 
father in poor circumstances, work- 
ing under a master for a livelihood, 
in many instances the ultimatum 
came to leave the Church or leave 
that employment. That meant very 
much of serious consequence to the 
struggling parent, seeking to earn 
a livelihood for his children, to lose 
his employment, but, in such cases, 
he did not hesitate a moment in the 
choice. Sometimes the test came to 
the son or daughter from unbeliev- 
ing parents. After using every ef- 
fort to persuade that son or daugh- 
ter not to espouse an unpopular 
religious cause, the verdict was giv- 
en that they must either forsake 
"Mormonism" or forsake the home; 
turn away from the family hearth- 
stone, cross the threshold for the 
last time, or abandon the prohibited 
religion. They met social ostra- 
cism, as well as experiencing a dis- 
ruption of family ties. I noticed to- 
day, in the printed program of a 
meeting of the Daughters of the 
Pioneers, a number of talks assign- 
ed on reminiscent subjects, among 
others the breaking and severing of 
home ties. I venture the assertion 
that those of you who may hear 
those reminiscent speeches will hear 
pathetic accounts of individual ex- 



periences in the severing of ties of 
kinship and affection which were 
dear to them, but which became nec- 
essary in order for them to be true 
and loyal to the Gospel. Some par- 
ents met their tests in having their 
children turn against them. The 
husband in having the wife no long- 
er his affectionate helpmate, on ac- 
count of his alliance with the "Mor- 
mon" religion; and the same with 
the wife in some instances. But 
they had received a witness for 
themselves of the truth of the Gos- 
pel they had espoused; they had 
received a fulfilment of the prom- 
ise that was given to Joseph Smith, 
that if they would do the will of the 
Father, He would manifest Him- 
self unto them. It could be said of 
them as the poet Lowell says of the 
month of June : 

"It is as easy now for the heart to be 
true 

As for grass to be green or skies to be 
blue, 

'Tis the natural way of living." 

And so with those true hearts who 
had courage and strength enough 
to sever the religious ties that for- 
merly bound them, also home and 
kindred ties, for the love of the 
Gospel, demonstrating that they 
were able to comply with that divine 
admonition recorded in Matthew 
10 : 37: "He that loveth father or 
mother more than me is not worthy 
of me : and he that loveth son or 
daughter more than me is not wor- 
thy of me." 

In gazing today on the faces of 
those aged brethren who sat in 
front of me in the large Tabernacle 
I thought that it could almost be 
said of them, as the prophet of old 
said of a vision given unto him, 
"These are they who have come up 
out of much tribulation." I saw 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART.

hand-cart veterans, men whom I 
knew had witnessed the death of 
many "Mormon" emigrants upon 
that trail between the Missouri and 
the Rocky Mountains, scores who 
died, without murmuring, at the 
hard lot that had caused them to 
forfeit their lives. The test came 
to the "Mormon" convert all along 
the line. They buried loved ones in 
unmarked graves, in the sea and 
upon the plain. When they came to 
these valleys they found such work 
as heroes perform, in overcoming 
the hard condition that confronted 
them, in order to secure suitable in- 
heritances, homes and comfort for 
their children and their children's 
children, and which are now being 
enjoyed by them. . 

The line that I have read to you 
brought to my remembrance an ar- 
ticle that I read a long while ago, 
the report of a speech delivered 
refuting a charge that was made at 
that time to the effect that the 
"Mormon" people were lacking in 
those qualities that make individ- 
uals independent, that make true 
men and women. It was an arti- 
cle in the first volume of Tullidge's 
Magazine, published about '81 or 
'82. The speech I refer to was 
made by one who was formerly a 
member of the "Mormon" Church, 
but who at that time had aposta- 
tized, but yet he recognized the fact 
that the charges then being made 
against his former associates, by his 
political colleagues and associates, 
were untrue. In that speech, made 
in support of the political cause that 
he had joined, he took occasion to 
refute the erroneous accusations his 
associates had uttered, and which 
find an exact re-echo in the lines I 
have read to you. He pointed out 
the fact that, instead of being sub- 
servient individuals, it required the 



highest strength of individuality 
and character to perform the work 
that had been accomplished by the 
"Mormon" people. He called at- 
tention to the fact that, to become 
members of the Church was to be- 
come iconoclast, in a certain sense, 
to the systems with which they had 
previously allied themselves. And 
so, the history of this people all 
along the line, from the time of 
their conversion abroad, and after 
they settled in these valleys and 
upon these plains, haiving been 
brought up "to the mountain of the 
Lord's House," established in the 
mountains and exalted above the 
hills, their history has shown cour- 
age, independence, manhood, all 
qualities which are the opposite of 
the epithets applied in the quotation 
read. 

The historian, Bancroft, in refer- 
ring to the "Mormons," says that 
the missionary adventurers of no 
sect are more devoted, more self- 
sacrificing, or more successful than 
were the missionary efforts of the 
"Mormon" people. He further says 
that "the Catholic friars, in their 
new world excursions, were not 
more indifferent to life, health, 
wealth, or comfort, not more indif- 
terent to sarcasm ana io siariuer, 
had no more high courage or 
lofty enthusiasm, than had the 
'Mormon' Elders in their Old 
World enterprises." That is the 
tribute an impartial historian gives, 
after the examination of hundreds 
of original sources of * information, 
manuscripts, magazines, papers 
and books bearing upon that sub- 
ject. 

My thought during this confer- 
ence time, has run something along 
the same line as that of others who 
have spoken. During the remarks 
of Brother Frank Y. Taylor, at 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Priesthood meeting - last evening, in 
reference to the care of our chil- 
dren, it occurred to me that while 
150,000 people had visited the Fair, 
and looked with pride upon the 
products of the field, fruits of the 
farm, and the works of art, after all, 
the most important thing, the most 
important question — the most im- 
portant product, if you please, is the 
character and kind of young men 
and women we are raising and de- 
veloping in this country. I recall 
the lines of a certain poetess, and 
say to mothers, "What a holy 
charge is theirs ; with what a kingly 
power their love might rule the foun- 
tains of the new born mind ; warn 
them to wake at early dawn and 
sow good seeds before the world 
has sown its tares." And that 
early dawn, that time to sow those 
good seeds, is before the child 
reaches the age of eight years, as 
we are given to understand in the 
Doctrine and Covenants. There is 
no sadder thought with a parent 
than to realize he has raised sons 
and daughters who have turned out 
badly. What a ioyous thing it is 
to father and mother when they re- 
alize that their children have been 
properly trained, that they are vir- 
tuous, that they have been able to 
sufficiently educate them, and have 
started them out in life right; that 
they have been fortunate in secur- 
ing happy wedlock, married to 
others equally virtuous and honest. 
I have a sublime admiration for the 
young man and wife who are will- 
ing to go upon, a quarter-section of . 
sagebrush land and redeem it, and 
make a home there for themselves. 
I have high esteem for a young 
mother living upon one of those 
places, desolate to begin with ; see 
her nursing a real live baby, not 
fondling a teddy bear or poodle dog, 



but devoting herself to those things 
that tend to the building of empires. 

We hear in this day a good deal 
said in reference to the Fatherhood 
of God, and the brotherhood of 
man. Where, my brothers and sis- 
ters, will we find greater evidence 
than in the revelations given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith concerning 
the great fact of the brotherhood of 
man, and the reality of the Fath- 
erhood of God. His work was es- 
tablished for the benefit of His 
children, that faith might increase 
in the earth, that those who sin may 
be chastened, that they may repent ; 
that those who seek wisdom may 
be instructed and that those who are 
humble might be exalted. The di- 
vine injunction is given to man to 
esteem his brother as himself, and 
practice virtue and holiness before 
the Lord ; man is not to speak evil 
of his neighbor, nor do him any 
harm; he is to visit the poor and 
the needy, and administer to their 
relief. A general compliance with 
these divine injunctions, for the 
betterment of mankind, would es- 
tablish bonds of brotherhood and 
fraternity so strong that contention 
and strife would be done away 
with. If those simple requirements 
were practiced universally by the 
children of men, what a transfor- 
mation it would make in the con- 
dition of the world ! 

I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord may be with you, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 

(Of Wayne Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice 
exceedingly in the spirit that has 



ELDER JOSEPH ECKERSLEY. 



107 



pervaded all the meetings of this 
conference. We know, notwith- 
standing all that may be said to the 
contrary, that it is the mission of 
"Mormonism" to save the souls of 
men. The evidence of this lies in 
the fact that every action of a Lat- 
ter-day Saint in life is of an unsel- 
fish character. Their energies, 
thought, and ambition, is to do 
something good in this world.^ I 
was deeply impressed, this morning, 
with the remarks of Elder Rulon 
S. Wells. He gave to us, in his 
brief address, what I think to be 
the essence, so to speak, of "Mor- 
monism," namely, a life of self-sac- 
rifice. Any person who has been 
thoroughly converted to the Gospel 
is converted to this principle, for it 
is a fundamental truth of true re- 
ligion. I rejoice that the true his- 
tory of this people of God testifies 
that they are indeed what they pro- 
fess to be, followers of the meek 
and lowly Nazarene. 

It has not been my good fortune 
to have the experience of the breth- 
ren who have addressed us here this 
afternoon. I think all of them have 
been blessed with the privilege of 
being born in the valleys of the 
mountains, in the Land of Promise. 
They have been blessed with "Mor- 
mon" parents, and have been raised 
in "Mormon" homes. Perhaps they 
have never heard or known any- 
thing of any religion but "Mormon- 
ism," until they attained manhood, 
and were sent as messengers of 
truth to the nations, I often regret 
that I have not had this privilege 
in my experience in life, yet I re- 
joice in the knowledge that God is 
no respecter of persons, and that 
the Lord loves all His children, 
wherever they may be upon His 
footstool. I was impressed by the 
tender way in which Brother Smoot 



referred to his mother this morn- 
ing. I was charmed with the ideal 
that he had in boyhood, the hope 
that he might some day have the 
opportunity of going with his 
mother to her native country, that 
she might again behold the scenes 
of her childhood, and be reminded 
of- the great blessings that God had 
brought- her by compliance with the 
Gospel. I was raised in one of the 
large centers of civilization in Eng- 
land. The Gospel came to me in 
my boyhood. I have passed through 
some of the experiences that Elder 
Hart referred to this afternoon, 
that are common to those who re- 
ceive . the Gospel in other lands ; 
but the Lord has sustained me 
through those unpleasant experi- 
ences. While it is true that, tem- 
porarily, the experiences encounter- 
ed when we receive the Gospel in 
the world are indeed to us a hard- 
ship, yet as the years roll by, and 
if we cling to the truth, if we ad- 
here to the principles of righteous- 
ness, those apparent sacrifices or 
disagreeable circumstances become 
the greatest blessings of our lives. 

I rejoice, when I contemplate the 
present magnitude of the work of 
God, and remember its small begin- 
ning. This should arrest the atten- 
tion of honest thinking men and 
women. They should be reminded 
of the words of the Savior when 
He said that "a tree is known by 
its fruits." When we think of all 
that "Mormonism" has accomplish- 
ed for this world, and what it is 
expected to accomplish in the fu- 
ture, it seems to me, if thinking men 
and women would consider what 
the Saints have done and are do- 
ing, and what our aims are, they 
would not be deluded into the belief 
that we are not a people who are 
striving to serve the Lord. It is 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



true that among- the Latter-day- 
Saints there are those who are not 
as pure in their lives as they should 
be, according- to the professions 
that they make, but is this not true 
of every church? Are there not 
people in every church in the land 
who do not live up to all the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of their 
churches, and whose lives are not in 
harmony with the professions they 
make ? We say this : wherever 
there is a man or woman in the 
Church who is a wrongdoer, he or 
she is not a true Latter-day Saint. 

Reputation is one thing: charac- 
ter is another; and the Lord will 
judge us acording to our character, 
not by our reputation. When men 
speak evil of us, we take consola- 
tion in the words of the Savior, 
speaking in the days of old to His 
disciples, He said, "Blessed are ye, 
when men shall revile you, and per- 
secute you and shall say all manner 
of evil against you falsely for my 
sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding 
glad : for great is your reward in 
heaven : for so persecuted they the 
prophets which were before you." 

Let us be sure, my brethren 
and sisters, that what the world says 
derogatory to the Latter-day Saints 
is false, so far as we are concerned 
individually, and then we need take 
no concern. The world has never 
said anything so bad about the Lat- 
ter-day Saints that has exceeded in 
hatred and the spirit of animosity, 
the falsehoods that were uttered 
against the Son of God. Hence we 
have consolation in the words that 
He spoke, for He foreknew that all 
who would live godly in Christ 
Jesus, all who would do right, who 
would decide to keep His command- 
ments, would be in ill repute with 
the peoples of the world, those who 
have given themselves over to the 



sensual pleasures of life, and take 
delight only in such gratification. 

I rejoice in the Gospel because 
of what it has done for me. I know 
as I live that God has established it 
Himself, that, by revelation from 
the Father and the Son, and the in- 
struction and teaching of angels 
Joseph Smith, a man of God, estab- 
lished this work, with a foundation 
so durable that all the persecution 
that can be waged against it will 
never shake the edifice, for God is 
the architect. The work of the 
Father will spread, and mission- 
aries by thousands will continue to 
publish this Gospel of peace, right- 
eousness, and good-will unto all the 
children of men, until the words of 
the Redeemer shall have been ful- 
filled. The Gospel shall be preached 
to every nation, every kindred, ev- 
ery tongue, and every people; and 
the honest and pure in heart, they 
who are seeking God, who are in 
the condition that the prophet of 
old spoke of when he said that they 
would run to and fro to seek the 
word of the Lord, will ultimately 
find it, for God loves the man who 
is seeking after truth. They may 
search in different directions, they 
may go to the various churches that 
have been established by men, but 
after a time they will come to the 
Lord, they will come to the truth, 
and God will draw them to the 
fountain of eternal light and righ- 
eousness. 

Let us take courage, hope and 
consolation in the promises God has 
made to us. Let us go home from 
this conference with an earnest de- 
termination in our hearts that we 
will serve the Lord. Let us reduce 
to practice every good precept that . 
has been taught us, and be faithful 
in keeping all the commandments 
of God; for this is the only way 



ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS.

that we can demonstrate our love 
for God, namely by keeping His 
commandments. We should do all 
that in our power lies to be Christ- 
like; emulate Him in our lives and 
thoughts, and we shall have joy 
while we live, and be privileged 
eventually to enjoy the association 
of the righteous forever. This is 
what I desire above all other things. 
I hope that we will take to heart the 
injunctions given to us and with all 
our getting get understanding and 
purity of heart. With all our 
searching, search for the love of 
God, and eventually we shall re- 
alize, to a greater extent than we 
now do, what it is to have the love 
of Christ burning in our hearts. 

May God bless you, is my prayer 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A quartet, "Content," was sung

Martin, Alexander Crawford, and

ELDER NEPHI L. MORRIS. 

(President of Salt Lake Stake.) 

I have greatly enjoyed the re- 
marks made by the various breth- 
ren who have spoken during this 
conference. I could not help feel- 
ing while looking over the vast au- 
dience at the Tabernacle this morn- 
ing, how fundamentally great a 
thing is this semi-annual conference 
which is held by the Latter-day 
Saints. Its importance is guaran- 
teed in the fact that God, by reve- 
lation, has made it a permanent in- 
stitution in His Church. From the 
very beginning of the work confer- 
ences have been held until the hold- 
ing of them has become a charac- 



acteristic of the people. Not only 
does this practice obtain in the 
Church in Zion, but it extends out 
into the missions of the world, as it 
does also in every stake and ward 
or branch in the Church. The va- 
rious Priesthood quorums, and the 
auxiliary organizations also meet in 
regular conference capacity. The 
Church, or mother organization, in 
these semi-annual conferences, calls 
her children together for counsel 
and instruction and to give reports 
while each of them has already 
convened in smaller assemblies to 
prepare for these great gatherings 
which represent absolutely every 
interest of the Church of Christ. 

I am aware that other religious 
societies beside our own observe a 
practice in some respects similar to 
ours : for instance, the Y. M. C. A. 
holds occasional conferences, the 
Epworth League has annual con- 
ventions, which are held in differ- 
ent parts of the country. Various 
churches convene their synods and 
convocations, but the Latter-day 
Saints are the only people who call 
these vast assemblies of the mem- 
bers and the officers for a series of 
eight or ten general meetings. 

The response to this call is so 
general that the Saints have for a 
long time been confronted with the 
problem of accommodations. As 
an effort at a partial solution of 
this perplexing problem, we find 
ourselves convened as the third 
section of the final session of this 
conference. From a consideration 
of this subject we may anticipate 
the day when conferences may be 
necessarily confined to sections of 
the Church where convenient 
groups of stakes will be convened in 
turn throughout the whole Church. 

It is interesting to study one of 
these conference congregations. 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Among- them will be seen the hus- 
bandman and the scholar, the arti- 
san and man of affairs, the school 
boy and the professor. In short, 
men and women from every calling 
and station in life are represented. 
The mere contact of such diversi- 
fied elements is necessarily educa- 
tive, and broadening, as well as be- 
ing conducive to unity and har- 
mony. And, perhaps, the greatest 
effect is found in the augmented 
conception which all must gain of 
the magnitude of this great latter- 
day work. 

In speaking of the diversified el- 
ements which compose one of these 
great gatherings, one is reminded 
of the fact that nearly all of the 
races of the earth are here repre- 
sented. This remarkable achieve- 
ment is brought about by the prin- 
ciple of gathering, another charac- 
teristic of our faith. In every Gos- 
pel dispensation the Lord has sep- 
arated his people from influences 
which would have restricted Him 
in the accomplishment of His pur- 
poses. It is very befitting that this 
great latter-day gathering from all 
nations should be brought about in 
a nation whose foundation stones 
were laid on precisely the same 
principle. Inter-mingling and cross- 
ing of races or types, under favor- 
able conditions, produce the great- 
est results. Our national life verifies 
this statement. Washington, Frank- 
lin, Jefferson, Jackson, in fact all 
the fathers of our nation, were the 
products of an inter-mingling of 
races on new soil, and in a better 
environment. The present occupant 
of the White House is another il- 
lustrious example of this principle. 
His ancestry may be traced back to 
the good old New York Dutch. If 
in a generation or two this princi- 
ple has produced such individuals 



as those named, may we not in suc- 
ceeding generations look for an en- 
tire people to become superior ? This 
theory is greatly strengthened bv 
the results of Mr. Burbank's exper- 
iments with plants. He seldom ob- 
tains results in one or two crosses 
of species and often not until the 
tenth or even the twentieth genera- 
tion. His final results, however, are 
astounding the scientific world. 

Does not this suggest that the 
Lord is employing the most natural, 
and at the same time the most effec- 
tual means of bringing about sim- 
ilar and even greater results in 
calling His chosen people from all 
the nations of the earth, and mak- 
ing of them a united whole? 

As Mr. Burbank, by painstaking 
care, brings each plant to a higher 
development in order to accomplish 
the final results, so should we as 
fathers and mothers and guardians 
of the youth of our people, by pray- 
erful vigilence bestow like care up- 
on the tender and beautiful plants 
God has entrusted to our nurturing 
in order to promote His purposes 
in the perfecting and exalting of 
the human race. To this end may 
we consecrate our lives is my prayer 
in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

I am led to say a few words this 
afternoon in regard to what was 
said in Priesthood meeting last 
night, looking to the distribution of 
the Book of Mormon among the 
people of the world. Brother Ells- 
worth, of the Northern States Mis- 
sion, reported that they had dis- 
tributed recently, by sale, several 
thousands of the Book of Mormon ; 
and so greatly had the demand in- 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



Ill 



creased for this scriptural volume, 
that he had given an order for a 
supply for the following year to be 
sold in his mission and in the South- 
ern States, Central States, and 
Eastern States missions. He had 
ordered one hundred thousand cop- 
ies, and he believed that would not 
quite fill the demand that would be 
made upon them during the com- 
ing year. Now this, my brethren 
and sisters, is very encouraging. It 
makes my heart glad to see this 
great book, containing the revela- 
tions of the Lord, the restoration of 
the Gospel, the pure principles of 
life and salvation, coming to be bet- 
ter known among the children of 
men, more universally appreciated. 

I am reminded now of something 
that I read a day or two ago that 
appeared in a morning paper, in 
regard to the laying and dedication 
of the cornerstone for the building 
of a church in Washington, D. C, 
the United Christian Church, that 
is to cost seven millions of dollars. 
J. Pierpont Morgan, one of the 
greatest financiers of the age, was 
present, and it is said that he was 
one of the largest contributors to 
the construction of that church. 
President Roosevelt also was pres- 
ent, and congratulated the general 
board of administration on the won- 
derful success they had met in ob- 
taining subscriptions toward the 
large amount of means needed for 
the building of this great house of 
worship. I am reminded, my breth- 
ren and sisters, of a house of wor- 
ship that was built in the early part 
of the nineteenth century. In 1833 
a house of worship was commenced 
in Kirtland, Ohio. It was erected 
under direction of the Prophet Jos- 
eph Smith, the Prophet of the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times. 
In the commencement of that build- 



ing it was conceded that there was 
not means enough in possession of 
all the members of the Church to 
erect the house; but, faith in God, 
the eternal Father, was the inspir- 
ing word, and they were successful. 
In less than three years from the 
time of its commencement the house 
was completed, known as the Kirt- 
land Temple, the first that was built 
by the Latter-day Saints, and it cost 
about $70,000. The Saints taxed 
themselves to the utmost in time 
and means to erect and complete 
that house of worship ; it was most 
earnest self-sacrifice and devoted 
labor. 

I would like to call your atten- 
tion to the prayer of dedication that 
was given by revelation through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. On the 27th 
day of March, 1836, this temple was 
dedicated, not as the Church I spoke 
of that is to be erected in Washing- 
ton, D. C, to Saint Peter and Saint 
Paul, but it was dedicated to Is- 
rael's God. "Thanks be to thy 
name," was the prayer of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, as he ex- 
tended his hands to heaven, and 
bowed before the congregation of 
the Saints : 

"Thanks be to Thy name, O Lord God 
of Israel, who keepest covenant and 
showest mercy unto Thy servants who 
walk uprightly before Thee.with all their 
hearts. Thou who hast commanded Thy 
people to build a house to Thy name in 
this place (Kirtland). And now Thou 
beholdest, O Lord, that Thy servants 
have done accordfhg to Thy command- 
ment, and now we ask Thee, Holy 
Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the 
Son of Thy bosom, in whose name alone 
salvation can be administered to the 
children of men, we ask Thee to accept 
of this house, the workmanship of the 
hands of us, thy servants, which Thou 
didst command us to build; for Thou 
knowest that we have done this work 
through great tribulation, and out of our 
poverty we have given of our substance,

to build a house to Thy name, that the 
Son of man might have a place to mani- 
fest Himself to His people." 

On that occasion, Sidney Rigdon 
preached the dedicatorial sermon, 
and he took for his text the follow- 
ing scripture, "The foxes have 
holes, the birds of the air have nests, 
but the Son of man hath not where 
to lay His head." Then he pro- 
ceeded and said in effect: Many 
edifices, churches, and temples of 
worship have been erected by the 
Christian sects of the world and 
dedicated to St. Paul,' St. Peter, St. 
John, St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. 
Luke and others of the Saints and 
Prophets named in church calen- 
dars, but for the first time in this 
generation, or dispensation, or dur- 
ing many hundreds of years past, a 
house is being dedicated this day to 
the name of the Lord, for His di- 
vine acceptance, a place for Him 
to visit or to dwell in. In proof 
that He did accept of this house, I 
beg leave to call your attention to 
section 110 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, from which I read to 
you as follows : "Visions manifest- 
ed to Joseph, the Seer, and Oliver 
Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple, 
April 3rd, 1836 

"The veil was taken from our minds, 
and the eyes of our understanding were 
opened. We saw the Lord standing 
upon the breastwork of the pulpit, be- 
fore us, and under His feet was a paved 
work of pure gold in color like amber. 
• • . . And His voice was as the 
sound of the rushing of great waters, 
even the voice of Jehovah, saying: T 
am the first and the last, I am He who 
liveth, I am He who was slain, I am 
your Advocate with the Father. Behold, 
your sins are forgiven you, you are clean 
before Me, therefore lift up your heads 
and rejoice. Let the hearts of your 
brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all 
My people rejoice. For behold I have 
accepted this house, and ... I will 



appear unto My servants, and speak unto 
them with Mine own voice, if My peo- 
ple will keep My commandments, and 
do not pollute this holy house.' " 

My brethren and sisters, the fol- 
lowing points I wish to impress up- 
on your minds : The circumstances 
under which this first temple was 
erected were seemingly unpropiti- 
tious for its completion, yet, by the 
faith of the Saints, and their united 
efforts, although but a handful, they 
did complete the house and dedicat- 
ed it to the Lord, and the Lord ac- 
cepted it. 

I am led to mark the difference 
that exists in the Church then and 
today, in regard to erecting public 
buildings. It is not a serious mat- 
ter now, nor one of long postpone- 
ment, for the Saints to undertake 
and complete any kind of public 
building needed by them, and finish 
it in beauty and excellence as they 
may desire to do, for we are much 
more numerous than we were in 
Kirtland. We have better facili- 
ties, and more means at our com- 
mand to accomplish the work that 
is required at our hands, and in this 
we rejoice exceedingly. I am led 
to note, at this time, the difference 
in the condition of the Prophet and 
his brethren in the early days of the 
Church and conditions as they are 
now. President Joseph F. Smith 
and his brethren are free to eo 
and come as they may deem prop- 
er. Not so in the days of the 
Prophet Joseph and his brother 
Hyrum. They knew no peace from 
the time of the Prophet's first vision 
in 1820, until their martyrdom in 
Carthage jail, in 1844. President 
Joseph F. Smith occupies the same 
position before the people and be- 
fore the world that his uncle, Jos- 
eph Smith the Prophet, occupied; 
and his brother John occupies the 



ELDER SAMUEL O.BENNION. 



113 



position that their father held, viz., 
Presiding Patriarch of the Church. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we 
truly rejoice in our improved con- 
ditions. We are glad that our breth- 
ren who preside over us now have 
liberty, have freedom of speech, are 
free to travel to and fro. As I said 
before, we rejoice at the improved 
opportunities that are now given to 
the people of the world to become 
better acquainted with the Saints, 
and with the Book of Mormon, that 
priceless book translated by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith from plates 
of gold, committed to him by the 
Angel Moroni, who gave to the boy 
Prophet of the nineteenth century 
the record which he translated by 
the gift and power of God. 

I testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that Joseph Smith was in- 
deed a Prophet of God ; that this is 
the Church of Jesus Christ, and 
that from it will grow His kingdom 
that shall fill the earth. I pray that 
we may prove faithful and maintain 
our integrity and purity of life, and 
be witnesses for Him that we may 
be acceptable unto Him, and in- 
crease in knowledge in regard to 
this great work which He has es- 
tablished in the earth. May we be 
true and faithful to all things com- 
mitted unto us is my earnest prayer, 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



The names of the General Auth- 
orities of the Church were present- 
ed by President Seymour B. Young 
and all were sustained by unani- 
mous vote of the congregation. (See 
l-'St in connection with report of 
proceedings in the Tabernacle.) 

A double quartet, "Home Love," 
was sung by the brethren who had 
rendered the preceding pieces. 



Benediction was pronounced by 
President Seymour B. Young.

ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION. 

(President of Central States Mission.) 

My brethren and sisters, my 
heart is full of gratitude to our 
Father in heaven, for having the 
privilege of meeting with you in 
conference this afternoon, and ex- 
pressing myself, according to the 
light that I have, concerning our 
work in the Central States mission. 
I sincerely desire an interest in your 
faith and prayers, that I may be 
enabled to talk as I would like to 
do concerning the work we are do- 
ing. 

As most of you, perhaps all of 
you, are aware, our headquarters 
are located in Independence, Mis- 
souri, to which place we moved last. 
March. It became necessary, it 
seemed, for us to have permanent 
headquarters for our mission, and 
we communicated about this mat- 
ter with the brethren at home, the 
First Presidency, and they instruct- 
ed us to go to Independence. I can 
say that we were received by the 
people there with open arms. The 
business people, the Christians of 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that town, are friends of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. In an article, pub- 
lished in the Kansas City Star, a 
short time ago, it was stated that 
"the 'Mormons' who were driven 
out in 1833 have returned, and we 
welcome them back." This was a 
source of pleasure to me, for I re- 
alized how our people, according' to 
history, had been persecuted in that 
country, when they were there be- 
fore. As I have said, we have our 
mission headquarters at Independ- 
ence, and we are taking - steps to 
economize the affairs of the mission 
and properly use and take care of 
the property which the brethren 
have purchased there. We have 
also established there the Liahona — 
Elders' Journal — the mission paper 
of the United States missions, which 
is published every week. I suppose 
that most of you are aware of this. 
We have a circulation of fifteen to 
eighteen thousand copies every 
week, and this after a run of but a 
few months. We are pleased with 
the support we are receiving, and 
the amount of good that we believe 
this paper is doing in the mission- 
ary field. We are in receipt of hun- 
dreds of letters praising our paper 
as a missionary magazine among 
the people who are scattered 
through the United States, Mex- 
ico and Canada. The people 
are welcoming the paper to their 
doors, in the absence of the Elders. 
We are short of Elders in the 
United States. Many times our 
people do not see an Elder for 
months, for the simple reason that 
the Elders cannot get around — they 
have so much to do that it is im- 
possible. We are advocating the 
plan that the Elders, when they go 
among the people, are to try and 
induce them to subscribe for the 
paper, that, in the absence of the 



Elders it may come to their homes 
and keep them alive in the faith. 
The Saints in the stakes of Zion 
have teachers visit them weekly or 
monthly to keep them alive to their 
duties, but the Saints in the world 
do not enjoy these privileges. We 
believe our paper is accomplishing 
good, and it has met with the ap- 
proval of the subscribers at large. 
We are thankful to our heavenly 
Father for this, and for the bless- 
ings He has bestowed upon us, in 
various ways, in the Central States 
mission. 

Recently, in connection with 
some of the other missions, we con- 
tracted for the publication of 100,- 
000 copies of the Book of Mormon, 
which we expect to dispose of 
among the people, and we believe 
we will be able to do this in a short 
time. Our Elders are meeting with 
success everywhere. There is some 
indifference, it is true, but among 
the people where they travel they 
are generally received with open 
arms ; and they are traveling mostly 
without purse or scrip, through the 
country districts, wherever they can 
travel that way. The people are 
manifesting an interest, and we feel 
to rejoice in the work of the Lord; 
we know that it is His work. 

I coincide with the sentiments ex- 
pressed by Brother Wells this 
morning, that the Later-day Saints 
should use the means our Father in 
heaven has given them — after they 
have paid their tithing — for the 
building up of His Church and 
kingdom here on this earth. The 
man or woman who will do this 
will be prospered and blessed. They 
will be rich in this life, and will re- 
ceive eternal life in our Father's 
kingdom — a reward that we are all 
seeking. The thought has appealed 
to me that, if we will use the funds 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



115 



our Father in heaven has given us 
for the good and benefit of His 
work, it will make us strong- in the 
faith; and if every man and wom- 
an will do this, how much stronger 
will the work of our Father be. Our 
lives should be consecrated to this 
work. We can support those who 
have been given unto us — there is 
no question about that, and also 
help to make the work of the Lord 
on this earth a success. 

I believe that we will be more 
active in this work in the future 
than we have been in the past; my 
experience in the missionary field 
has given me this belief. I have 
never wanted for anything needed. 
Where I preside, and among those 
with whom I labor, I have never 
heard one complain about their 
conditions. Sometimes the people 
at home say they cannot afford to 
support their sons in the mission 
field. I think the simple reason is 
that they haven't the faith that those 
boys have while out in the mission 
field. Yesterday a lady approached 
me who said: "I am a widow; I 
have seven children, the oldest is in 
your mission ; we want him to stay 
there until the Lord sees fit to re- 
lease him." I tell you, my brethren 
and sisters, those are the sentiments 
that make this Church strong; that 
is the kind of support we need. Our 
people should have that spirit ani- 
mate their souls, and we want that 
spirit in their sons that will make 
them men of God, on whom we can 
depend. When they come out into 
the mission with that feeling, we 
send them out to labor, and they 
are a success ; they work faithfully 
for the building up of the Church 
of the Master here on the earth. I 
am thankful for the support that 
we receive from our friends, and 
the missionaries. The Elders, as a 



rule, are loyal to the cause they 
represent, working hard for the 
building up of the kingdom. 

I was thinking, a short time ago, 
that if this body of people were as 
actively engaged in the work at 
home as the Elders are in the mis- 
sionary field, how great we would 
be. We all should be loyal to the 
very letter, standing up as a body 
in support of the Church, and lift 
up our hands and say : we will help 
this cause as long as our Father in 
heaven requires it of us. I am 
thankful unto the Lord for this 
privilege, the privilege of associ- 
ating with men who, I know, have 
the authority from our Father in 
heaven to administer and to direct 
His work. They are men of God. 

Before I sit down, I want to bear 
my testimony that I know that God 
lives; it is not a mere belief, but it 
is a knowledge with me. I know 
Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith is a Prophet of God. I know 
we have men who are Prophets of 
God in our midst; the man who 
stands at the head of this Church 
today is an inspired man of God. 
As a people we should support him, 
that he may be able to accomplish 
the work that His Father has sent 
him to do on the earth. May we, 
all Israel, be loyal to the cause we 
represent, from this time on, more 
than we have ever been, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

When I took my seat at the be- 
ginning of this conference and faced 
the people, I asked myself the ques- 
tion : What will our brethren say 
to these people during the confer- 
ence ? Then I remembered a line in 
one of our familiar hymns : "What 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



more can we say than to you we 
have said;" and I confess that I 
was not able to think of anything at 
that time that might be regarded as 
of special interest to this confer- 
ence, that could be discussed. The 
conference, however, had not pro- 
ceeded very far — only a few of the 
brethren had addressed the meet- 
ings — when another thought occur- 
red to me, and that was : How shall 
we find the time to consider all the 
subjects of interest that have been 
brought before the people and sug- 
gested by the remarks of the breth- 
ren ? I confess now, my brethren 
and sisters, that I think many very 
important and weighty matters will 
have to be passed with only a mere 
allusion to them by the speakers in 
this conference — subjects that it 
would be profitable for us to con- 
sider, if we could only devote the 
time to such consideration. 

I was especially interested in the 
remarks of my brother and friend, 
Elder Orson F. Whitney ; and while 
correcting misrepresentation and 
calling attention to those who, 
either wittingly or unwittingly, ma- 
lign our people, is not always a 
pleasant task, yet occasionally it is 
necessary in order that the annals 
of the times may be correctly writ- 
ten ; and that there may be less op- 
portunity for villains to falsify his- 
tory. Therefore I rejoiced in his 
defense of our people ; and as I 
followed him in his defense of the 
people, I wished in my heart that 
our defense was always as well con- 
ducted, for you remember he not 
only spoke of those who had mis- 
represented the people, but he gave 
a meed of praise to those who had 
spoken truly of us, or had refrained 
from joining in misrepresentation 
of the people of God. I rejoiced in 
his praise of such honorable men; 



and to the names of Bishop Tuttle 
and Bishop Leonard, whom he men- 
tioned, I want to add one other 
name, the name of a most honorable 
man. In the year 1903 a represen- 
tative of theNewark (New Jersey) 
News, being in our midst, called 
upon the Right Reverend Lawrence 
Scanlan, the Catholic Bishop of the 
Diocese of Utah and Nevada, and 
in reporting what took place, the 
representative of the News said : 

"That veteran old priest, Bishop Scan- 
lan, who has charge of all Utah and the 
eastern half of Nevada, for the Cath- 
olic Church, has visited every remote 
corner of Utah, during 30 years he has 
been here. He said : 'I have found the 
'Mormon' people a gentle and kindly 
disposed people. I have never been in- 
sulted once. I have been obliged to visit 
places where there are no hotels, and 
wherever I have stopped at private houses 
the people have always felt offended if 
I offered to pay them for the keep of 
myself and my horse.' Have you ever 
felt the need of a revolver?' I asked. 'I 
never owned one in my life.' Pointing up 
to the crucifix, the Bishop said, 'That is 
the only weapon I have ever carried.' 
The Catholic Church has ten thousand 
communicants in Utah at the present 
time ; I do not see your name, Bishop, 
on protests and other papers that some 
of the ministers here are active in circu- 
lating.' 'No,' he replied ,T never join in 
anything of that kind. My mission here 
is not to make war among the 'Mor- 
mon' people or any other people, but 
rather to be the bearer of the message 
of peace and good will toward all men. 
If there is any law to be enforced, I 
leave that for my government to do.' " 

It is a pleasure to speak of hon- 
orable Christian conduct wherever 
we find it. I am unacquainted with 
Bishop Scanlan, personally, al- 
though I have exchanged some let- 
ters with him and received some 
courtesies from him in the way of 
contribution of articles to our 
Young Men's Magazine. I am 
aware of the close friendship that 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



117 



existed between the Bishop and the 
late Elder Erastus Snow. That 
friendship should be an object les- 
son to all the people of our state, 
that it is possible, notwithstanding' 
we hold different views from our 
fellow Christians, in relation to re- 
ligion — it is nevertheless possible 
for honest and honorable men to 
dwell together as fellow citizens of 
our common country, without en- 
mity or bitterness, one toward an- 
other. And I thought I would like 
to mention these matters concern- 
ing this honorable Catholic Bishop 
with whom, and, so far as I know, 
with whose congregation and peo- 
ple we live at peace, notwithstand- 
ing our views of religion are as op- 
posite, perhaps, as it is possible for 
them to be. 

Following somewhat the course 
of Elder Whitney in the correction 
of misrepresentation, I read to you 
now a brief quotation from the 
Historical Magazine of July, 1906, 
containing an insinuation that I de- 
sire to correct. The author says : 

"The Saints, wherever located, have 
had trouble with their neighbors, being 
successively expelled from Ohio, Mis- 
souri, and Illinois. To the latter state 
they went in 1839, and were received 
with such open-armed hospitality as only 
a very generous and liberty-loving peo- 
ple can extend to those whom they hon- 
estly believe to be suffering from a 
wrongful oppression. The conduct of the 
Saints in five years turned this feeling 
of extraordinarily deep-seated sympa- 
thy, inducing great practical charities, 
into a feeling of very bitter hatred, 
threatening to break into mob violence." 

It has become quite common of 
late for articles to appear in the 
press, of this spirit, referring to the 
experiences of the Church in Ohio, 
Missouri, and Illinois, in justifica- 
tion of the warfare now waged 
upon the Church in this western 



land. In a recent article contributed 
to the Lewiston (Maine) Journal, 
reviewing some favorable comments 
in the Journal on the Mormon peo- 
ple and their religious system, the 
following passage occurred : 

"The Mormons have lived in five dif- 
ferent states If their system 

is as pure morally and as patriotic as it 
is claimed to be, how does it happen that 
their sojourn in each of these states 
was characterized by continued and in- 
creased conflict with the established gov- 
ernment and laws of these states and of 
the United States while the great Chris- 
tian denominations live in peace and har- 
mony under those same laws?" 

It is argued from the fact that the 
Latter-day Saints had difficulties in 
these states where the Church was 
formerly located, that it is evident 
that there was some misconduct on 
their part which warranted the cru- 
elties practiced upon them, and 
which led to their expulsion from 
those states ; and that the same jus- 
tification for opposition to the 
Church exists now as existed then. 
In the consideration of, and, as l 
hope, in the refutation of that idea, 
I am going to deal with a little his- 
tory. I cannot, of course, cover the 
whole ground, and for very special 
reasons, which I trust will be ap- 
parent as I proceed, I am going to 
take the case of Missouri in her 
treatment of the Latter-day Saints. 
I am going to take the case of Mis- 
souri for the reason that the charges 
now made against the Church of 
Christ, of lawlessness, and of un- 
Americanism, were not then made, 
and could not have been made dur- 
ing the experiences of the Church 
in Missouri. It was impossible then 
for our opponents to make these 
charges, or to justify the aggres- 
sions practiced upon the Saints, un- 
der the plea of putting down a plur- 
al marriage system, or of the domi- 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



nation of the state by the Church; 
no complaints were made on either 
score. 

First, let me tell you the net re- 
sults of the persecution of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints in Missouri, so far as 
they can be told in a summary : 
There were killed outright of men, 
women and children,, so far as care- 
ful estimates can be made, more 
than fifty souls. There were as 
many more wounded and beaten. 
How many perished by slow death, 
suffering untold agonies, by reason 
of exposure and cruelties, no one 
knows, nor can it be computed. 
More than 250 houses were burned 
or otherwise destroyed, and the 
families dwelling in them rendered 
homeless ; and though, in some in- 
stances, those homes were humble, 
it must, nevertheless, be remember- 
ed that they were all that the peo- 
ple had, and they were homes to 
them. There were between twelve 
and fifteen thousand people expelled 
from the state of Missouri, under 
circumstances entailing excruciat- 
ing suffering,and in mid-winter they 
.were driven across the Mississippi 
into the state of Illinois. These suf- 
fering oeople were dispossessed of 
land holdings of over 250,000 acres ; 
and the worst and most disgraceful 
of all, to those guilty of the deed, 
the chastity of women, by brutal 
force, was violated. This is merely 
a summary of that persecution. 
Now, what is it that is alleged as 
the justification of this cruelty — 
cruelty inflicted upon a people, be 
it remembered, not in a savage land, 
not in a remote age, but in the 
nineteenth century, under the guar- 
antees of constitutional freedom to 
worship God, in the Great Repub- 
lic of the new world? So far as 
may be gathered in brief, from the 
utterances of the mob, these people 



dared to believe that God had spok- 
en from heaven, that angels had re- 
visited the earth, that a volume of 
American scripture had been re- 
vealed and translated by the power 
of God; they dared to believe the 
blasphemy (and these are mob 
terms) that the sick could be healed 
by the laying on of hands ; and 
further, "they believed in all the 
wonder-working miracles of the 
ancient Christian religion." These 
phrases are not mine ; but they 
live in my memory, and are 
re-called from the confessions 
of the mob. The Saints were 
advised by General Clark at the 
fall of Far West, when about 
to be driven from the state and dis- 
possessed of their lands, that they 
ought never more to gather togeth- 
er in communities, with Apostles 
and Prophets, with Bishops and 
High Councillors ; in other words, 
their belief in the ancient Christian 
Church organization was, in part, 
the rock of their offending. We may 
not dwell on these things, but that 
you may have before you the evi- 
dence that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints had vio- 
lated no law of the land, and was 
therefore not amenable to the law of 
the land, listen to this, from a mob 
document promulgated as a "secret 
constitution," making these com- 
plaints against our people, and 
seeking to justify their acts of vio- 
lence toward them, expressing their 
intention to rid their society of our 
people, "peaceably if they could, 
forcibly if they must." It said : "The 
arm of the civil law does not afford 
us a guarantee, or at least a suffi- 
cient one, against the evils which 
are now inflicted upon us and seem 
to be increasing by said religious 
sect. Th/: evil is one that no one 
could ha 1 e foreseen and therefore 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 119 



is unprovided for by the laws ; and 
the delays incident to legislation 
would put the mischief beyond rem- 
edy." That is a frank, though 
perhaps unconscious, confession 
that there were no faults of 
our people . that lay open to 
correction under the law. Now, 
let me say that I do not hold up to 
your view the idea that our people 
were without faults ; by no manner 
of means ; there was much of un- 
wisdom in some of their utterances 
and some of their actions, much that 
was foolish and vain ; much that 
was the result of zeal without wis- 
dom, some things, perhaps, tha»- 
smack of fanaticism; I grant you 
that individuals were guitly of 
great unwisdom, but such offenses 
as our people were guilty of were 
offenses against the strict and high 
moral law and requirements of the 
Gospel, and not against the laws of 
the land, so that while the Saints 
were amenable to God, under those 
circumstances, they were not amen- 
able to the state. They lived above 
the law of the state — in the sense 
that they kept the law, and there- 
fore were not subject to the penal- 
ties of the law of man. Notwith- 
standing this, the foregoing cruel- 
ties — the sum of which I have men- 
tioned — were practiced upon the 
Saints. 

Now, out of this Missouri expe- 
rience I want to evolve, if I can, a 
lesson, both to the Latter-day Saints 
and, I trust also, sincerely trust, a 
lesson for those who oppose, in un- 
righteousness, and by violence, the 
work of the Lord. I shall draw you a 
parallel : The Missourians, between 
1832 and 1839, complained loudly 
against our people, and as a reason 
for their unfriendship toward them 
and desire to be rid of them, stated 
that they were a people from the 



North, that they were of different 
manners and customs, and even dif- 
ferent in the accent of their speech 
from the old settlers of Missouri ; 
but Missourians were taught to tol- 
erate a people of different manners 
and customs, and learned to put up 
with the New England nasal twang 
of accent before they got through 
with it. The Missourians com- 
plained of the rapidity with which 
the Saints gathered into the state; 
but the Missourians learned to tol- 
erate a greater and a more rapid in- 
flux of northern people into their 
state than was ever known during 
the sojourn of the Saints in their 
midst, before they were through 
with their experiences. The Mis- 
sourians falsely charged that thei 
coming of "Zion's camp" into their 
midst was practically an armed in- 
vasion of the State. "Zion's camp," 
let me explain, was a company of 
men less than 200 strong, who 
came with provisions and with ag- 
ricultural implements, to the assist- 
ance and support of their brethren, 
who had been expelled from Jack- 
son county under circumstances of 
great cruelty; and since the gover- 
nor of the state had refused to es- 
tablish a standing military force to 
maintain them in the possession of 
their homes when they should be 
reinstated in them by his official act, 
it was thought a good thing to 
strengthen the number of the peo- 
ple, that they might protect them- 
selves, if the state would not pro- 
tect them — and the state had re- 
fused to protect them. The coming 
then of "Zion's camp," I repeat, 
was called an armed invasion of 
the state. Well, Missouri, before she 
got through with it, learned what an 
armed invasion of ^ the state meant. 
The Missouri compromise — I for- 
get now the exact date of its oc-

currence — but the Missouri com- 
promise was practically annulled — 
that compromise which forbade 
the introduction of slavery into 
the territory of the United 
States north of the southern 
boundary line of the state of Mis- 
souri — that compromise was prac- 
tically annulled by legislation intro- 
duced into the national Congress by 
Stephen A. Douglass, by which the 
question of states being slave states 
or free states when admitted into 
the American Union, was to be left 
to the people when they should 
come to form the constitution for 
their states. This precipitated a 
struggle, as you will remember, for 
the possession of Kansas. New 
England emigration agencies and 
abolition parties undertook to make 
Kansas a free state, and hence sent 
great numbers of their emigrants 
into eastern Kansas, that faced the 
western counties of Missouri, where 
the Saints formerly made their 
homes. This resulted in one of 
the most cruel border wars 
(beginning about 1855) known to 
the history of the United States or 
to the history of the world. The 
jay-hawking parties on the one 
hand, the lawless ruffians who came 
from the north, and the bushwhack- 
ing parties on the other, overran 
those western counties of Missouri 
until anarchy prevailed and violence 
everywhere abounded, and that is 
what I mean when saying that Mis- 
souri came in contact with the men, 
and were compelled eventually to 
tolerate the men of different man- 
ners and customs and accent of lan- 
guage from their own. 

But to continue the parallel. Mis- 
souri falsely charged the Saints with 
being abolitionists, with tampering 
with their slaves,encouraging the in- 
coming of "free people of color," 



which they claimed threatened their 
slave system of industry ; and for 
this reason they plotted against the 
Saints, and justified the outrages 
against them — because their institu- 
tion of slave labor was menaced by 
the incoming of so-called abolition- 
ists. I desire to say for the Latter- 
day Saints, and for the Prophet 
Joseph Smith especially, that they 
were very conservative upon the 
question of slavery. The Prophet 
Joseph approached that tremendous 
problem in the true spirit of states- 
manship, and had the nation but had 
the wisdom to follow the counsel he 
gave it, with reference to that great 
issue, it is quite possible that there 
would have been no Civil War, with 
its sad history of destruction of 
treasure and life. More than twen- 
ty years before Ralph Waldo Emer- 
son advocated the purchasing of the 
slaves of the south with the money 
received from the sale of the public 
lands, Joseph Smith was out before 
the people of the United States with 
that policy. The New England 
philosopher received all sorts of 
praise for his suggestion, and he 
was hailed as a great Christian phil- 
anthropist and humane statesman 
for the presentation of that policy 
to the country; but a celebrated 
writer, Josiah Ouincy, calls atten- 
tion to the attitude of the "Mor- 
mon" Prophet on this question in his 
book, "Figures of the Past," and in 
effect asks : If praise is due to 
the Christian philosopher for ad- 
vancing this doctrine when war 
clouds were discernable in the 
sky (1855), what must be said of 
the "Mormon" Prophet who antici- 
pated him by some eleven years, 
with the announcement of the same 
policy ? 

The exact language of Mr. Quin- 
cy is : 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 



1 A J 



"We who can look back upon the ter- 
rible cost of the fratricidal war which 
put an end to slavery, now say that 
such a solution of the difficulty [the pur- 
chase of the slaves] would have been 
worthy a Christian statesman. . But jf 
the retired scholar [Emerson] was in 
advance of his time when he advocated 
this disposition of the public property in 
1855, what shall I say of the political 
and religious leader [Joseph Smith] 
who had committed himself in print, as 
well as in conversation to the same 
course in 1844? If the atmosphere of 
men's opinions was stirred by such a 
proposition when war clouds were dis- 
cernable in the sky, was it not a states- 
man-like word eleven years earlier when 
the heavens looked tranquil and benefi- 
cent?" 

It was not true, I repeat, that the 
Saints were abolitionists, or that 
the Prophet Joseph was an aboli- 
tionist, in the sense of the +erm ap- 
plied to those early New England 
agitators of that question. But 
Missouri finally found agitators of 
that question within her own bor- 
ders and in the nation who kept up 
the agitation until Missouri lost 
115,000 of her slaves, representing, 
in property to her people, upwards 
of forty millions of dollars. 

In the midst of their distress the 
Saints in Jackson county called 
upon Governor Dunklin to estab- 
lish military protection for the peo- 
ple until it was certain that the 
civil law would be respected; but 
the governor claimed that there was 
no constitutional warrant which 
authorized him to do such a 
thing; but the people of west- 
ern Missouri, who clamored against 
his doing such a thing in 
behalf of the "Mormons," in time 
found themselves under the neces- 
sity of asking for the same kind of 
protection against the border ruf- 
fians from Kansas ; and Governor 
Stewart, unlike Governor Dunklin, 
found his wav to establish such mil- 



itary protection. Then something 
strange happened : When the Saints 
in Far West and at other point s took 
up arms in their own defense and 
declared that they would no longer 
yield without resistence to the vio- 
lence of mobs, then this same mob 
clamored for military protection 
against the "Mormons/ and it was 
given them ; and the leaders of the 
mob were converted into generals 
and colonels, and captains, and lieu- 
tenants, ad infinitum; I doubt if the 
race has died out yet — this race of 
titled officers. And thus the leaders 
of the mob became the commanders 
of the militia; and the militia was 
but a mob conyerted into the di- 
visions and sub-divisions of an 
army. The Saints suffered im- 
measurable injustice from such an 
arrangement as that; because now 
to oppose this mob-militia was to 
oppose the constituted authority of 
the state; and their self-defense 
put the Saints in the atti- 
tude of resisting government. 
Well, western Missouri, in the 
course of her experience, had meas- 
ured out to her a dose of that same 
kind of medicine ; for when the jay- 
hawking parties of Kansas discov- 
ered that Missouri was likely to of- 
fer them successful armed resist- 
ance, they appealed to the general 
government ; and in response to that 
appeal the jay-hawking leaders 
were constituted generals, and col- 
onels, and captains, and lieutenants, 
in the Regular Army of the United 
States; and their troops — the di- 
visions and sub-divisions of their 
army — were those same jay-hawk- 
ing parties who but a short time 
before had been a mob; and the 
people of Missouri were put in the 
attitude of contending against con- 
stituted authority; and that villain, 
General James H. Lane, and that 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



equally great villain, General Jen- 
nison, perpetrated outrages which 
officers of the Regular Army of the 
United States, General Hallack 
among them, had the manhood 
and the courage and the hu- 
manity to denounce as the most 
savage kind of warfare, a dis- 
grace to the uniform of United 
States soldiers ; and in this denuncia- 
tion he was joined by Governor 
Charles Robinson, the Union gov- 
ernor of Kansas. 

Missouri falsely charged the 
Saints with illicit communication 
with the Indians, and feigned a fear 
that their state would be invaded by 
savages and their homes laid deso- 
late. It was untrue, as the other 
charges against the Saints were 
untrue ; but Missouri learned 
what it was to realize the 
fulfilment of this false fear ; for the 
governor of the adjoining state, the 
state of Arkansas, authorized Al- 
bert Pike, during the Civil War, 
to enlist two regiments of 
Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, 
and with these (himself garmented 
as an Indian chief and painted in 
the war colors of the tribe, to please 
the Indians) Pike marched into the 
state of Missouri, and this force 
was employed at the battle of Pea 
Ridge. Before going into action, the 
Indians, it is said, were given liquor 
and made drunk,that to their savage 
nature there might be added this 
other adjunct of savagery; and the 
mutilation of the dead, the desola- 
tion and terror spread abroad by 
these savages brought about a re- 
alization of the false fears expressed 
by the people of Missouri on this 
subject, when falsely charging the 
Saints with illicit relations with the 
Indian tribes. 

Missourians, instead of enforc- 
ing the law for the protection of the 



Latter-day Saints in the state, gath- 
ered together in their public assem- 
blies and expressed the fear that if 
the "Mormons" remained, the result 
must be civil war, and their homes 
would be laid desolate. The ques- 
tion was of a nature, they said, that 
no man could in such an event re- 
main neutral; all must be partici- 
pants on the one side or the other. 
They made this the ground of de- 
manding that the Latter-day Saints 
remove, at least from one county in- 
to another, and always they held it 
out that the presence of the Saints 
was a menace of civil war. Well, as 
in the other cases of this parallel, 
Missouri learned what civil war was 
before she was through with it. You 
will remember that Missouri was a 
a "cape of slavery" thrust up 
into free territory — that is, there 
were free states on the east and 
west, and the north of her, and she 
was assailed from every side 
throughout the Civil War. By an 
eight thousand majority her people 
determined that Missouri should 
not leave the Union; and she did 
not. But a very large number of 
her people — well, nearly half of 
them — sympathized with the South, 
and the struggle it was making for 
separation from the Union. This 
brought on a condition of affairs in 
Missouri that was most terrible. It 
made that state suffer more than 
any other state of the Union suf- 
fered ; first, in this: that whereas 
the other states had four long years 
of civil war, Missouri had practi- 
cally ten, when you take into ac- 
count her border warfare, for she 
had five years of border war before 
the South seceded, and she had a 
number of years of civil war, or 
rather guerilla warfare within her 
borders, after the Civil War had 
closed; aye, and until the year

1881, the western counties of 
Missouri, where the Saints had 
dwelt, and from which they had 
been so unjustly expelled, were 
troubled with banditti, that made 
that section of Missouri a reproach 
to the state, and the state a reproach 
to the nation. During the Civil War 
Missouri furnished her quota of 
troops to the Union Army amount- 
ing in all to 109,000, including 8,000 
of her former slaves. But through 
sympathy for the Confederacy, her 
people also furnished 30,000 troops 
for that cause,bringing up her quota 
of troops in the field to 139,000. The 
proportion of troops to population 
in the western and middle states 
amounted to 13.6 per cent of the 
population; in New England, to 12 
per cent of the population, but Mis- 
souri sent into the field more than 
14 per cent of her population — or 
something over 60 per cent of those 
in the state subject to the call for 
military duty. Of this number sent 
to the front in both armies, 27,000 
perished in battle or from their 
wounds, or from disease. At one 
fell swoop forty millions of dollars 
in property to the people of Mis- 
souri was wiped out of exis- 
tence by the emancipation of 
their slaves. Missouri gave seven 
millions of revenue to sustain her 
troops in the field. Four years af- 
ter the war closed, some years of 
which were prosperous, it is disclos- 
ed by the official statistics, that the 
taxable property in Missouri, was 
$46,000,000 less than it was in 
I860; and this was civil war! Par- 
don me, I am going to dwell a lit- 
tle longer on it, and I hope you will 
be interested. 

In the year 1864, Sterling Price, 
(the man who riveted the shack- 
les upon the limbs of Toseph Smith, 
Hyrum Smith, Parley P. Pratt, and 



Sidney Rigdon, in Richmond pris- 
on, Ray county, Missouri), at the 
head of twelve thousand men, en- 
tered the state of Missouri in 
the southeast borders of it, and 
cut a zigzag swath of destruc- 
tion through the state, for a 
distance of more than fourteen 
hundred miles. During that time 
he fought 43 battles and skirmishes ; 
he destroyed more than ten millions 
of dollars in property, and chiefly 
among his own friends. His raid 
extended through the very counties 
formerly inhabited by the Saints, 
from thence he made his escape into 
the state of Kansas. In 1863, west- 
ern Missouri having been a hot-bed 
of treason, rebellion, and guerilla 
warfare where southern sympa- 
thizers could recruit their horses 
and provisions, General Thomas 
Ewing, then in command at St. 
Louis, determined to break up these 
conditions, and hence issued his 
celebrated "Military Order No. 11," 
admitted to be one of the most dras- 
tic military orders ever issued in 
this or any other country, when you 
take into account the manner in 
which it was executed. It gave the 
people of named localities fifteen 
days to move from their homes, and 
designated the places to which they 
might go. The orders were most 
drastically executed. The scenes of 
suffering passed through by the 
Latter-day Saints in 1833 were en- 
acted on a larger scale. Houses 
were burned, the furniture was 
stacked in the front yards and 
burned before the eyes of the own- 
ers ; old age was not respected ; men 
and women were shot down in cold 
blood. Everywhere desolation 
reisned, and the roads were 
thronged with the people escaping 
from the cruel execution of this or- 
der. It was from this incident that 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



G. E. Bingham, the noted artist, 
painted from scenes enacted in Jack- 
son county, Missouri, his celebrated 
painting, now in the Capitol at 
Washington, entitled "Civil War," 
which he "dedicated to the lovers of 
civil liberty." In that painting you 
may see the aged patriarch, the ten- 
der maiden,the black slave,the weep- 
ing matron, the startled children 
leaving the grand old mansion, of 
southern style, in flames, and every- 
where the chimneys of neighboring 
houses standing as monuments of 
the abounding desolation. This 
brings to my remembrance a cir- 
cumstance connected with the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and General 
Doniphan. General Doniphan was 
the friend of Joseph Smith; a 
friend who, on one occasion, nobly 
stood out against the execution of 
a mob-militia court-martial order — 
and some of those who took part in 
the court-martial, by the way, were 
ministers, or so-called ministers, of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. This court- 
martial condemned the Prophet Jos- 
eph to be shot in the public square 
of Far West, in the presence of his 
people. On one occasion, when 
General Doniphan was in consul- 
tation with the Prophet, a Missouri- 
an came in to settle a bill with Don- 
iphan, and offered in settlement of 
his bill some lands in Jackson coun- 
ty, and Doniphan told him he would 
think of it. Then the Prophet 
said to Doniphan : "Doniphan, I 
advise you not to take that Jackson 
county land in payment of thait 
debt ; God's wrath hangs over Jack- 
son county ; God's people have been 
ruthlessly driven from it, and you 
will live to see the day when it will 
be visited by fire and sword; the 
Lord of Hosts will sweep it with 
the besom of destruction ; the fields 
and farms and houses will be de- 



stroyed, and only the chimneys will 
be left to mark the desolation." This 
was uttered in 1834. In 1863, L. 
M. Lawson, a man of standing in 
the commercial world, in the state 
of New York, a brother-in-law to 
General Doniphan, visited him. 
Those of you who are acquainted 
with Doniphan's history know that 
although he was a veteran soldier in 
the Mexican war, he took no part 
in the Civil War, only as a sorrow- 
ful spectator. With his brother-in- 
law, Mr. Lawson, he rode out into 
Jackson county, on the occasion of 
the visit above mentioned, and com- 
ing upon the crest of a hill, and see- 
ing nothing but the chimneys of 
houses standing for miles around 
them, the monuments of once splen- 
did homes, General Doniphan re- 
lated the circumstance of the proph- 
ecy of Joseph Smith and said that 
he was much impressed by what the 
"Mormon" Prophet had told him. I 
dwell too long on this ; let me draw 
the conclusion. 

You who have followed me 
through this parallel, find in every 
false fear that was feigned by the 
Missourians, in consequence of 
our people living among them, 
you see it answered by a reality, 
a terrible reality, the very worst 
of all their false fears were realized, 
but not through the agency of the 
"Mormons." Every false charge 
made against the Saints of God 
came back home to the Missourians, 
the measure heaped up, pressed 
down, and running over. Can you 
doubt that there exists anything but 
the relation of cause and effect be- 
tween these two things. This leads 
me to this reflection, and this is the 
lesson I want to bring home to you 
Latter-day Saints,namely : This Mis- 
souri experience gives us the assur- 
ance that God's eye is upon His peo-

pie. You stand within the shadow of 
His all-protecting arm. You may 
not be assaulted without just cause, 
without serious consequence result- 
ing - to those guilty of the offense. 
The commandment is .still in force: 
"Touch not Mine anointed ; do My 
prophets no harm ;" and though, in 
individual cases — and it is quite 
possible in national instances, too, 
sometimes— that we may not live to 
witness the judgment of God falling 
upon men or states guilty of in- 
justice, still it is well that such 
judgment, swift and sure, should 
follow sometimes lest men should 
come to think that Justice sleepeth, 
or, what would be worse, that she 
does not exist at all. I accept, for 
one, this terrible experience of Mis- 
souri in the border wars and in the 
Civil War from 1855 to 1865, as 
her chastisement for the wrongs she 
inflicted upon the Saints of God. 
She sowed to the wind. Who will 
deny that she reaped the whirlwind ? 
I stood amid the glories of the Fair 
that celebrated the acquisition of the 
Louisiana purchase, held at St. 
Louis, Missouri, in 1903, and I saw 
Missouri honored, in that group of 
states, beyond all other states, for 
within her borders the Fair was 
held and there was gathered togeth- 
er the wealth and splendid achieve- 
ments of our modern civilization. 
Day after day I walked in the midst 
of the "White City," and I recalled 
the fact that the government had ap- 
propriated forty millions of dollars 
to assist in this great exposition, of 
which Missouri was the chief ben- 
eficiary; and then I marveled 
why it should be so — that this 
state that had so stripped and 
wounded the people of God and 
sent them bleeding, literally, from 
her territory into exile. "Why is 



she so honored?" I asked myself a 
hundred times. It was in search- 
ing for the answer to that question 
that led me to the investigation of 
these facts in her history on 
which I have been dwelling; 
and that led me to believe that 
Missouri had paid, to the ut- 
most farthing, so far as the state 
was concerned — what the account- 
ing of individuals will be is not for 
me to say — but as a state, I believe 
that Missouri's chastisement cleans- 
ed her of that grave wrong-doing, 
and hence new-born honors begin 
coming to her. May she never 
again forfeit the favor of God, but 
chastened by those sad experiences, 
may that great commonwealth, in 
which stands the center place of 
Zion, be multiplied in blessings and 
peace. May she continue as she 
has begun, with open arms to wel- 
come back the people she once ex- 
pelled from her borders ; and if she 
will she shall,in the name of God,she 
shall, find favor and blessing, where- 
as before she found condemnation 
and chastisement. Mav the days of 
her peace continue and abide ! May 
God bless Missouri, the center place 
of Zion. 

Now, I have pointed out to you 
the fact that you Latter-day Saints 
are beneath the protecting care of 
God ;andO, what strength that gives ! 
what comfort, what a consolation ! 
How brave it should make us ! How 
strong it should inspire us to be ! 
But it should not make us proud; 
rather it should make us humble ; it 
should make us full of mercy and 
gentleness and consideration for 
others — for the strong and the 
brave are ever gentle and generous 
— and feeling about us as we must 
the strength of God, these qualities 
of gentleness, generosity, and jus-

tice towards others should always 
characterize the Church of God, the 
Latter-day Saints. 

Just one more word : Let those 
who in their pride, bitterness ot 
heart and wickedness of disposition, 
strike at this work, learn a lesson 
from Missouri ; for we are speaking 
of that which is, of the truth, and 
not of fallacies or chimeras; and 
so, in kindness, I bring to their at- 
tention this sad experience of Mis- 
souri, that it may warn them against 
the evil of their ways. I want to bear 
testimony to the truth of what my 
friend and brother, Elder Whitney, 
said the other day, that the misrep- 
resentations that are fulminated 
here at our headquarters and scat- 
tered broadcast in the nation, stand 
in the relation of cause to effect, 
written in violence. I am a wit- 
ness of the reality of that: I saw 
the mangled, bullet-torn bodies of 
men in Tennessee who were mar- 
tyred, not so much by the hands of 
ignorant, dull backwoodsmen, but 
by those who fulminated the evil lie 
first published here in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, and which afterwards 
was peddled by so-called ministers 
of the gospel in Louis county,Tenn., 
from house to house, until ignorant 
men in that locality were inflamed 
with passion, and doubtless some 
of them thought they were really 
doing God's service in murder- 
ing God's servants. I say that 
these poor, ignorant men who shot 
down our brethren in cold blood, 
stood in the relationship to those 
who fulminated the falsehood that 
lighted the flames of hatred in their 
hearts as the hand to the mind — the 
hand to the man in action. Nor is 
that the worst of it. The then gover- 
nor of the territory of Utah, Eli H. 
Murray, must needs undertake to 
convert this murder into a means of 



accomplishing the end of the con- 
spiracy that was then being hatched 
in Utah against the people of God. 
In a telegram to Governor Bate, 
since United States Senator Bate, he 
presumed to thank his excellency of 
Tennessee for offering- a reward 
that Elder Golden Kimball, who is 
sitting here, and myself induced him 
to offer, by repeated petitions and 
persistence in the matter — I say the 
governor of Utah thanked the gov- 
ernor of Tennessee for trying to 
bring to justice those who had com- 
mitted this crime, but he was ex- 
tremely careful twice in his tele- 
gram to tell the governor that these 
men were but the "agents of organ- 
ized crime," and told him also that 
so long as the Tennessee representa- 
tives in Congress refused their as- 
sent to legislation then pend- 
ing before Congress these scenes 
would doubtless • be repeated 
against the agents of "organ- 
ized crime." Such acts as these 
in aid and abetment of crime are in- 
famous ; and men who, by falsehood 
and its promulgation, enrage the 
ignorant and incite them to deeds 
of violence are the greater crimi- 
nals. Individuals guilty of such 
acts will be held accountable for 
them, either now or in the world to 
come; and states and nations that 
participate in acts of injustice, as 
in the case of the state of Missouri 
in its conduct toward the Latter- 
day Saints, will meet some time and 
somewhere with just retribution. 

My brethren and sisters, the 
Gospel is true ; we have received a 
special dispensation of it. It is for 
us to be true and faithful to it, 
which I pray we may, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen. 

At the conclusion of Elder Rob- 
erts' remarks, President Smith arose

President. 

The chgir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 
Come, let us rejoice in the day of sal-

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 
each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come. 
The opening prayer was offered by 
Elder John Nicholson. 



The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn: 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free 

We here enjoy; 
In this far western land, 
A true and chosen band, 
Led hither by Thy hand, 

Would sing for joy. 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

OPENING ADDRESS. 

I wish to say a few words at the 
opening of our conference this morning. 
I feel myself, and I hope every Latter- 
day Saint does, very grateful for this 
beautiful morning and the prospect of 
good weather while we are convened. I 
trust that every Latter-day Saint will 
exercise faith that this beautiful 
weather may continue during confer- 
ence. Many people that are here this 
morning and who will be here during 
our whole proceedings, have come from 
a long distance, and some have 
perhaps made what may be called 
sacrifices in order to come. I 
want to say to everyone that 
it is our privilege to be blessed to such 
an extent that we will feel perfectly 
repaid for all the inconvenience that 
may have resulted to us in coming to 
this gathering. As Latter-day Saints 
the Lord has placed us in relation with 



2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



himself, and in order to carry out the 
condition that we are in we need His 
blessing above any other class of peo- 
ple. 

Our prospects are sufficiently grand 
and glorious to cause us to put forth 
every exertion that we possibly can, in 
order to secure the blessings that are 
before us. Nothing should deter us 
from the exercise of every power that 
God has bestowed upon us, to make our 
salvation and exaltation sure. All men 
and women who are worthy to be called 
Latter-day Saints should live hour by 
hour in such a way that if they should 
be called suddenly from this life into 
the next they would be prepared. The 
preparation should be such that we 
should not fear to be called away sud- 
denly into the sDirit life. It is our 
privilege to so live as to have the spirit 
of light and intelligence to that extent 
that we shall feel satisfied that all will 
be well if we should be called away at 
any hour. 

If we look back at our experience 
since we received the Gospel, we can see 
and know that the Lord has blessed 
us abundantly. If we have been faith- 
ful, as we should have been, or if we 
have not been so faithful as we should 
have been, but now feel to do right, we 
have assurances, from our past ex- 
perience, that everything will be well 
with us in the future as we tread the 
path of exaltation and glory, walking 
in the light of the truth and carefully 
observing everything that is required 
of us. If there should be any Latter- 
day Saints within the sound of my 
voice that have not reached this as- 
surance in regard to their future, they 
should not rest satisfied until they have 
secured it, so that they may know that 
everything is right with them. 

What I want of the Latter-day Saints 
is that during this conference, as the 
Elders shall arise to address us, our 
faith and our prayers may be exer- 
cised for each one who speaks, that he 
may say such things, and that we may 
have the spirit to receive such things 
as shall be beneficial to all. This is 
our privilege and our duty. We have 
not come here accidentally; we have 
come in this conference expecting to re- 
ceive something that will be advant- 
ageous to us. The Latter-day Saint9 
most assuredly need to receive good 
things. Of ourselves we can do nothing. 



As Jesus said: "Verily, verily I say 
unto you, the Son can do nothing of 
himself, but what he seeth the Father 
do; for what things soever he doeth, 
these also doeth the Son likewise." He 
came into this life to do the will of his 
Father, and not his own will. Our de- 
sire and determination should be the 
same. When things come up that re- 
quire an exertion on our part, we should 
bring our wills into subjection to the 
will of the Father, and feel to say, 
what is the will of our Father, whom 
we are here in the world to serve? 
Then every act that we perform will be 
a success. We may not see its success 
today or tomorrow, nevertheless it will 
result in success. 

We have received principles of truth, 
but not in blindness. We do not walk 
in blindness, but we walk in the light 
of truth. We know what we are about 
and what will be the result of our 
faithfulness. But we should be wise 
and prudent; we should learn to govern 
ourselves, to control our passions, and 
to bring all our faculties and powers 
into perfect obedience to the mind 
and will of God, so that these bodies, 
which God has given to us, may be gov- 
erned and controlled in all respects as 
He would wish. The Latter-day Saints, 
by being wise and prudent, can make 
this life a tolerably happy one. We 
need not live in misery; we need not 
feel that we are sacrificing all the time, 
but that what we call sacrifices prove a 
blessing to us, which we would not re- 
ceive were it not for this experience. 
Everything that transpires affecting us 
individually may be made a blessing, 
and will be a blessing to us if we act 
wisely and prudently. 

We are not here to fight anybody; we 
are not here to contend with anybody. 
We are here to move slowly along, per- 
form the duties that are required at 
our hands, mind our own business, and 
let others mind their business^ or not 
as they see proper. In this way we 
shall progress and gain an experience 
that will be useful to us, not only in 
this life, but in the life to come. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters. 
May we walk in obedience to the com- 
mandments of God continually, and if 
we do I will assure you that we will 
receive blessings far greater than we 
ever anticipated. God bless you, Amen.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

A Lesson to be Drawn from the Career of Kin" 
Saul — Ti.e Obligation of ObeciieDce to God— 
The Law of Tithing. 

Brethren and sisters: In taking up 
the Bible this morning, I was very 
much impressed with certain words 
that I read therein which touched upon 
the principle of obedience. President 
Snow this morning has dwelt somewhat 
upon this principle. I have many times 
thought and still think it is one of the 
cardinal principles of the Gospel. We 
read in the 9th chapter of I Samuel 
that God designed to make a king over 
Israel. He chose a young man by the 
name of Saul, the son of Kish, a Ben- 
jaminite. It is said that he was a 
choice young man, and there was not 
among the Children of Israel a goodlier 
person than he. From his shoulders 
and upward he was higher than any 
of the people. It seems that the father 
of Saul had lost his mules, and he sent 
his son Saul in search of them. As he 
went forth he met the Prophet Samuel, 
who had been made acquainted with 
the fact that God had selected this 
young man to be king over Israel. Sam- 
uel called him in and anointed him 
to be king. But let me tell you, breth- 
ren and sisters, that it was not suf- 
ficient that this young man should be 
a choice young man, of fine appearance 
and taller by head and shoulders than 
any others in the House of Israel, but in 
order that he might be the king and 
a servant of God, a change must come 
over him. Man can serve man by the 
spirit of man, but in order to be a serv- 
ant of God we must have the spirit of 
God. So it proved to be in this in- 
stance, for Samuel instructed Saul that 
in returning to his parents he would 
come up with a company of prophets, 
and that he should join the prophets, 
and that the spirit of the Lord would 
come upon him. Samuel further said 
to him: 

"And thou shalt prophecy with them, 
and shall be turned into another man. 

"7. And let it be, when these signs are 
come unto thee, that thou do as oc- 
casion serve thee, for God is with thee. 

"8. And thou shalt go down before me 
to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down 
unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and 
to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings; 
seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come 
to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt 
do." 



Now mark what follows: 

"And it was so that when he turned 
his back to go from Samuel, God gave 
him another heart; and all those signs 
came to pass that day." 

We can see, brethren and sisters, how 
this man was favored of God, not only 
in being called to be king and in pre- 
siding over something like three hun- 
dred thousand people (for they were 
numbered in those days, and that was 
said to be the number) but also that he 
should receive of the Lord another 
heart and be changed into a new man. 
Notwithstanding this, however, there 
was a flaw in the character of Saul 
that proved in the end his ruin. 

You will remember that Saul was in- 
structed to go down to Gilgal and to 
remain there seven days, when the 
prophet would meet him there, and to- 
gether they should offer burnt offerings 
and a sacrifice to the Lord, and upon 
that occasion also the prophet was to 
tell him what the Lord required. Saul 
went down to the place appointed, and 
he waited there for the prophet, but the 
prophet did not come exactly as the 
king expected. He may possibly have 
delayed his coming. At any rate, the 
king became nervous, for there was 
some disturbance among the people and 
the Philistines were about to come 
against them in battle. So, instead of 
waiting for the prophet, Saul under- 
took, of his own authority, to offer up 
burnt offering and sacrifice, contrary 
to the commandment of the Lord. When 
Samuel came down he said to Saul: 

"What hast thou done? And Saul 
said, because I saw that the people were 
scattered from me, and that thou earn- 
est not within the days appointed, and 
that the Philistines gathered them- 
selves together at Michmash; 

"12. Therefore said I, the Philistines 
will come down now upon me to Gilgal, 
and I have not made supplication un- 
to the Lord; I forced myself, therefore, 
and offered a burnt offering. 

"13. And Samuel said to Saul, thou 
hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept 
the commandment of the Lord thy 
God, which he commanded thee; for 
now would the Lord have established 
thy kingdom upon Israel forever. 

"14. But now thy kingdom shall not 
continue; the Lord hath sought him a 
man after his own heart, and the Lord 
hath commanded him to be captain 
over his people, because thou hast not 
kept that which the Lord commanded 
thee." 

Now to Saul it may have appeared a 



4 



GENERAL* CONFERENCE. 



very simple matter that he should not 
wait the coming of the prophet. Why 
could not he, a king, make offering and 
supplication to the Lord? Why should 
he wait for the coming of Samuel? Be- 
cause it was the will and commandment 
of the Lord, and he did not obey it. 
In this we have an evidence of the 
goodness of God in one way and of 
his strictness in another way. The 
king was assured by the prophet that 
if he had obeyed the commandment of 
God, his kingdom would have been es- 
tablished over Israel forever; but that 
having departed therefrom, his kingdom 
should not continue. We have another 
illustration in the life of Saul of the 
great importance of being obedient to 
the commandment of the Lord. When 
the Children of Israel came to the 
promised land from Egypt, under the 
guidance of the Almighty, on one oc- 
casion, when they were weary and 
footsore, the people of the Amalikites 
came out against them, and harassed 
them upon the right hand and upon the 
left and slew their women and their 
children and their tender ones. 

Because of this piece of treachery and 
unfriendliness to a people who had 
never injured them, the Lord deter- 
mined that they should be destroyed, 
and he told the prophet to write it 
down in a book of remembrance, that 
when the people were established in the 
promised land and became strong they 
should go against the Amalikites and 
carry out the commandment of the 
Lord with respect to that people. Saul 
was selected by the prophet to perform 
this duty. He was told to gather to- 
gether the hosts of Israel and to give 
battle to the Amalikites. He was com- 
manded to destroy them from the face 
of the earth, because they had fought 
against Israel in the day of their weak- 
ness and trouble. Saul gathered the 
hosts of Israel and went against them, 
and destroyed them. But it is said in 
the scriptures that Saul and the people 
spared Agag the king and the best of 
the sheep and of the oxen and of the 
fatlings and all that was good, but 
everything that was vile they destroyed 
utterly. Samuel came to Saul, and 
Saul said unto him: 

"Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the 
Lord, and have gone the way which the 
Lord sent me, and have brought Agag 



the king, and have utterly destroyed 
the Amalikites. 

"21. But the People took of the spoil, 
sheep and oxen, the chief of the things 
which should have been utterly des- 
troyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy 
God in Gilgal. 

"22. And Samuel said, hath the Lord 
as great delight in burnt offering and 
sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of 
the Lord? Behold to obey is better 
than sacrifice, and to hearken than the 
fat of rams. 

"23. For rebellion is as tne sin of 
witchcraft, and stubbornness is as in- 
iquity and idolatry." 

The Lord did not say to Saul that 
there was anything wrong in burnt of- 
fering and sacrifice, but he said that 
obedience was better than sacrifice. 

And later on Samuel said unto Saul, 
"I will not return with thee; for thou 
hast rejected the word of the Lord, and 
the Lord hath rejected thee from being 
king over Israel." 

In another place it is said that the 
Lord repented that he made Saul king 
over Israel, because he had forsaken 
him and failed to keep his command- 
ments. 

It seems to me, brethren and sisters, 
that we can draw a lesson of wisdom 
from this story of the king of Israel. 
We can see that when the Lord gives a 
commandment to the children of men 
He requires the strictest obedience to 
that command. When the Lord speaks 
he means something. It is not as the 
conversation of one man with another, 
when we do not weigh our words and 
think not of the result thereof, but 
when the Lord delivers a command- 
ment to his people it is binding upon 
them. We have the commandments of 
the Lord in the Bible, in the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, in the Book 
of Mormon and in other Church works, 
wherein is set forth the mind and will 
of the Lord unto His people. Further- 
more, we have the living oracles; we 
have the prophet of God to stand forth 
in the midst of Israel and deliver unto 
us the mind and will of God. 

The Lord has said in these last days 
that he will not be mocked, and that 
we cannot disregard or treat lightly his 
words. We know that many troubles 
and evils have come upon the people 
from time to time because of the dis- 
regard of the word of the Lord. We 
have been told, publicly, by the Presi- 
dent of the Church that if the Latter- 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON. 



day Saints had heeded strictly the word 
of the Lord delivered to them through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, they would 
now have been established in those 
eastern lands from which they were 
driven, and would be today the wealthi- 
est community upon the earth. The 
Lord would have watched over and de 
livered them out of the hands of theii 
enemies. It does not follow either thai 
if they had been obedient to the com- 
mand of God they would not have been 
brought to this land. I believe they 
would have been directed to this favor- 
ed spot, and also established here and 
blessed abundantly. No doubt some of 
the evils under which we are struggling 
at the present time are due in a meas- 
ure to our disobedience, for we have 
been instructed that Zion might have 
been redeemed long ago if the Saints 
had been faithful. 

We have strayed in a measure from 
the commandments of the Lord. Some 
of our people have put private inter- 
pretations upon the laws of God. Take 
the law of tithing for instance. It is 
very simple and easy to be understood. 
Very few words are employed by the 
Lord to set this law before his people. 
He says that He requires of his Saints 
one-tenth of their interest annually. It 
seems to me that every man, woman 
and child could easily determine what 
their interest is annually. It is not a 
command of man; it is a command of 
our Heavenly Father. I have no right 
to put a private interpretation upon it, 
or to vary from it, or to say that a 
man is entitled to figure out this that 
and the other until he has nothing to 
pay tithing on, and in some cases until 
the Lord himself is brought in debt to 
the individual. I take the law as it 
comes to us in the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants. I have had no trouble 
in determining just what my tithing is. 
I have had no trouble in paying my 
tithing when I have paid it as I, went 
along. The only trouble I ever experi- 
enced was when I left it until the end 
of the year, and when I figured it up it 
was a source of anxiety to me as to 
whether I had paid my tithing or not. 
But if we pay it as we go along, it is 
a simple matter, and the probabilities 
are that we will be honest in it with 
the Lord. It is so with all of the com- 
mandments of God. 



There is a blessing predicated upon 
the observance of every commandment. 
We cannot ignore it or depart from it 
or change it to suit our own notions 
and then expect to obtain the blessings. 
The Lord does His part, we must do 
ours. So I have rejoiced in contemplat- 
ing this great and glorious principle of 
obedience. It has strengthened my 
faith. It has caused me to make new 
resolves. I have come to understand a 
little more than I understood last week 
or last month, the strictness of the 
Lord and how careful He is that his 
servants and people should obey Him, 
a.nd what is meant when it is said that 
the Lord would choose a man after his 
own heart. It meant, I think, that He 
would choose a man who would obey his 
commandments. We know that the 
Savior was a man after the Lord's own 
heart. We are told that if we would 
have salvation we must follow the ex- 
ample of the Savior, and the great dis- 
tinguishing quality of the Savior was 
his obedience. He came not to do His 
own will, but the will of the Father in 
all things. We too should feel that we 
are not here to do our own will, but 
the will of the Father. With respect 
to tithing? Yes. With respect to the 
Word of Wisdom? Tea With respect 
to faith, repentance, baptism and the 
laying on of hands? Yes. With respect 
to all the great commandments which 
the Lord has delivered unto us? Yes. 
And not one more than another. 

We do not single out the principle of 
tithing and say it is the greatest com- 
mandment God has given. We simply 
say, it is a commandment of God and 
we should obey it. We do not say that 
a man will be saved and exalted simply 
because he obeys the law of tithing. 
We must live by every word that pro- 
ceedeth forth out of the mouth of the 
Lord, and one commandment is as 
sacred as another. They are all need- 
ful for the welfare of the Church and 
for the accomplishment of the pur- 
poses of God. We cannot pick and 
choose and say we will keep this com- 
mandment because it is pleasant to us 
and we wall slight another because it is 
not agreeable. 

I pray that we may be greatly blessed 
in our conference; that the spirit of the 
Lord may rest down mightily upon the 
President of the Church and upon the

brethren who shall be called to address 
the people, that we may be edified and 
strengthened, encouraged and renewed 
in our faith. I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

Advantages of Colonization and Manual Labor. 

Brethren and sisters, in standing be- 
fore you this morning I assure you I 
feel very dependent upon the spirit of 
the Lord to give me utterance. With- 
out that spirit I feel that it would be 
unprofitable for me and my brethren 
to occupy the short time allotted to us 
in conference, where there is so much 
to be spoken of and so much business 
to be transacted pertaining to this great 
people. Therefore I pray that the Lord 
may bring to my memory some things 
that I have had upon my mind, and 
which I desire to speak a few words up- 
on. I will read a portion of the 58th 
section of the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants: 

"26. For behold, it is not meet that I 
should command in all things, for he 
that is compelled in all things, the 
same is a slothful and not a wise serv- 
ant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. 

"27. Verily I say, men should be anx- 
iously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and 
bring to pass much righteousness; 

"28. For the power is in them, where- 
in they are agents unto themselves. 
And inasmuch as men do good they 
shall in nowise lose their reward. 

"29. But he that doeth not anything 
until he is commanded, and receiveth 
a commandment with doubtful heart, 
and keepeth it with slothf ulness, the 
same is damned." 

These are the words of the Lord unto 
this people through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and they are applicable to us at 
this time. As a people, I believe that 
when the prophet of God stands before 
us and says "thus saith the Lord," we 
all feel in our hearts that he is speak- 
ing the mind and will of God. How- 
ever united we may be in this respect 
and in other duties that devolve upon 
us, we are not as united as we ought to 
be. 

I hold that the Latter-day Saint who 
goes out from the crowded cities, takes 
up a portion of mother earth, and seeks 
to establish a home upon that piece of 
ground, is just as much engaged in the 
building up of Zion and in the work 



of the Lord as they who go out into the 
world to preach the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus. For our spiritual salvation 
would not amount to very much if it 
were not coupled with our temporal sal- 
vation. We have the battle of life to 
contend with, as well as the battle for 
salvation in the world to come. I feel 
that there is not altogether the united 
effort among the people of the Lord 
that there ought to be in our coloniza- 
tion matters. I deprecate the tendency 
that appears to be increasing among 
the young Latter-day Saints to rather 
earn a livelihood in an easy manner, 
by the use of the pen at the bookkeep- 
er's desk, or the use of the scissors be- 
hind the dry goods counter, than to go 
out and assist in the great colonization 
that devolves upon this people. I do 
not feel that it is the duty of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to seek their own ease. 
The man who chooses a life of ease 
rather than one which will bring him- 
self and his muscle in conflict with the 
sterility of the soil, does not develop 
within his heart the love of God as 
much as does the pioneer who goes 
forth with a desire to build up Zion 
materially. It is true, we are not all 
fitted for the same avocations in life, 
but I have noted in traveling among the 
people who are the colonizers of today 
that in many instances their sons and 
daughters have a desire to make an 
easy living. They do not desire to stay 
on the farm and to labor as their fath- 
ers and mothers have done. They lose 
sight of the fact that brains can be 
used in the colonization of new coun- 
tries and in the cultivation of the soil 
as well as in callings to be found in the 
city. It is true, that in any avocation 
in life there is always room at the top; 
but it is not easy for young men and 
women to come in from the country and 
make a good living in the cities. Very 
often we find them, after they have 
labored five or ten years, without a 
home and without anything laid up for 
their future welfare. They may have 
had a pretty easy time of it; they may 
have been able to take advantage of the 
theatres, the pleasure resorts, etc., but 
they have not made any material ad- 
vancement. It is my firm belief that if 
this spirit prevails among the young 
Latter-day Saints, it will only be a mat- 
ter of a generation or two until our 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 



people will be the employed and not the 
employers. There should be a spirit in- 
stilled into the hearts of those who at- 
tend the Colleges of the Latter-day 
Saints, at any rate, to create employ- 
ment, rather than to seek employment. 
We have learned by experience that it 
amounts to but very little to go out 
into the world and preach the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus to the people, and 
then bring them to these cities where 
they are not able to gain for themselves 
a livelihood. Very often bad results 
have arisen from this condition. There 
should be as great a desire to possess 
the earth and to become employers as 
there should be to go out and preach 
the Gospel. I do not know the reason 
of it, but it almost appears as if the 
young people of today abhorred the 
thought of using the hammer or the 
plane, or becoming connected with any 
business that entails hard work. The 
desire appears to be to make a living 
by the head, and not with the body 
and brain combined. I feel that this 
is wrong, for in time it will create a 
one-sided education. It seems to me 
that now is a good time to urge upon 
the fathers and mothers to teach their 
sons and daughters that farm 
life and the life of the col- 
onizer and pioneer is not all 
drudgery, but that there are many 
advantages connected with it. The days 
of colonizing by this people are by no 
means past. 

There are vast tracts of land which 
I believe the God of Heaven has kept 
in reserve for this people. They only 
wait the diversion of the streams from 
their natural courses to transform them 
into thrifty farms and settlements. I 
believe that for a long time to come 
this country will furnish to our people 
places where the climate is good, where 
there is an abundance of water and 
land, where they can make good homes 
for themselves, and where, after a few 
years of hard labor, they will be able 
to give employment to others. They 
will not always have their "nose on the 
grindstone," nor will they be under the 
necessity of walking the streets and 
begging employment of other people. 
There is scarcely a day passes, when I 
am in the city, but some one comes to 
me who desires employment, or better 
employment than he already has. 



A great many of those who are em- 
ployed in this city at the present time 
are spending more than they are mak- 
ing. It may be partially on account of 
extravagant habits that we have ac- 
quired in the last few years. But it is 
nevertheless a very unsatisfactory sit- 
uation. Where people are busily en- 
gaged and have plenty to do, they are 
generally contented. If we will labor 
each day so that at the end of the day 
we can feel that we have accomplished 
something, we are able to lie down at 
night and partake of the God-given rest 
that comes to a tired body. But, as I 
have stated, very often the desire is to 
avoid this kind of life, and to shun 
labor which would soil our hands. This 
is not the spirit of the latter-day work. 
If our people do not take advantage of 
the vast tracts of land that are around 
us, and make Latter-day Saint homes 
thereon, we will ultimately find our- 
selves surrounded by a people not of 
us, who will possess the earth and take 
advantage of these opportunities that 
we are allowing to pass by, apparently 
unheeded. I believe that it is a righte- 
ous desire for a Latter-day Saint to 
wish to possess some of God's earth; 
and mothers and fathers can do much 
better with their children, so far as 
rearing them in the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is concerned, upon the 
farm, where they can furnish them em- 
ployment, than in the crowded cities, 
where they might have to walk the 
streets without employment and have 
nothing to occupy their minds but evil. 
There are many young Latter-day 
Saints today being led away in this 
manner, and I believe that one cause of 
this is the fact that we are neglecting 
as a people to make use of the soil, the 
streams of water, and the elements 
which surround us. 

My brethren and sisters, these are 
things that it would be well for us to 
consider. I feel that the Latter-day 
Saints need more blacksmiths, more 
mechanics, more colonizers, more young 
men and young women who are not 
afraid to go out and battle with the 
elements, and take advantage of the 
opportunities which God has placed 
within our reach, as our fathers and 
mothers have done. It has made good 
men and good women of them. They 
engaged in occupations that today are

considered undesirable, but they are 
better men and women than we are. 
We ought to desire to build up the ma- 
terial Zion; and while we may not be 
commanded in these things, we should, 
as the revelation which I have read 
says, be willing to do many things of 
our own free will and choice. 

Where our people have gone forth in 
organized bodies, in accordance with 
counsel, to settle up new countries, they 
have been able to accomplish much. 
But where they have gone without the 
advice of their Bishop, or without the 
knowledge of the President of their 
Stake, they have contended one with 
another, have been disunited, and in al- 
most every instance have made a fail- 
ure of their canals and their coloniza- 
tion in general. Where, however, they 
have followed the counsels of the serv- 
ants of the Lord they have been pros- 
pered, they have become a wealthy and 
industrious people, and their sons and 
daughters have become men and wo- 
men of muscle and brain. 

May God grant that we may improve 
in respect to some of these things; that 
we may be a people who will keep con- 
stantly in view the necessity of union; 
that we may seek to support one an- 
other materially as well as spiritually; 
that we may desire to build up one an- 
other and thus build up the kingdom 
of God; that we may eliminate the 
spirit of selfishness from our hearts, 
and that we may grow and increase in 

the knowledge of God and his pur- 
poses. This is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

Importance of General Conference — Ti e Sphere 
and Regulation of Temporal Affairs— Need for 
Efficient Elders In the Mis.-ionary Field. 

My brethren and sisters, I am grati- 
fied for the privilege of being with you 
at this conference, and especially for 
the opportunity of being instructed by 
my brethren. I recognize the fact that 
I am always in need of instruction and 
admonition. I believe that this is the 
case with all the Latter-day Saints. 
That we may be fed with the bread of 
life, particularly with that portion of 
it which is adapted to the immediate 
wants of the Saints, is the object of 
this general conference. The Church 
is sixty-nine and a half years of age 



today; and while the congregation does 
not entirely fill this tabernacle, it is 
very large compared with the member- 
ship of the Church on the 6th day of 
April, 1830. Soon after the organization 
of the Church, we are informed, by the 
Doctrine and Covenants, conferences 
were inaugurated and it was enjoined 
by revelation that the various branches 
of the Church should send representa- 
tive men to the conference, that they 
might, if called upon, represent the 
condition of the work of the Lord in 
their respective branches, and also that 
they might partake of the spirit which 
actuated the Prophet of the Lord and 
his associates. 

The importance of these conferences 
should be impressed upon the Latter- 
day Saints throughout the Stakes of 
Zion; and I believe that the spirit of 
them is extended to the various nations 
of the earth. I know that when I have 
been abroad preaching th j Gospel, and 
a conference has occurred during my 
absence, I have felt the spirit of the 
occasion. Though I have been absent 
in body, I have been present in spirit. I 
have rejoiced in occasions of this char- 
acter, though thousands of miles away 
from them. 

When Brother Rudger Clawson read 
from the scriptures this morning, I was 
reminded of a statement made in the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants, which 
I will read. It is in Section 59: 

"Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are 
they who have come up unto this land 
with an eye single to my glory, accord- 
ing to my commandments." 

This was revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph at the time the Saints were as- 
sembled in Jackson County, Missouri, 
that land having been designated by the 
Lord as the great central gathering 
place of the Saints of God in this dis- 
pensation; and the expression in this 
paragraph: "Blessed saith the Lord 
are they that have come up unto this 
land with an eye single to my glory," 
is very indicative. The importance of it 
is demonstrated in subsequent history 
.of the efforts of the Saints of God to 
lestablish Zion in Jackson County; for in 
ithe inception of this work the Lord 
Jcommunicated to the Prophet Joseph 
'Smith all the keys and authority and 
every essential for the complete estab- 
lishment and accomplishment of the 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

work of God in the last days, and this 
included the principle of union. Brother 
Woodruff has been speaking to us this 
morning relative to the necessity of our 
having material interest in the work of 
God. I believe, indeed, I know, that if 
we confined our worship to the mere 
singing of hymns and the delivering of 
religious sermons, the Saints of God 
would die temporally; and if it were 
all temporal, they would die spiritually. 
That which is esteemed temporal and 
which is deprecated in the estimation 
of the religious world is sanctioned in 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ from the fact 
that all things are spiritual with God. 
We read in the revelations of God, to 
the Prophet Joseph, this saying of the 
Lord: 

"Wherefore, verily I say unto you, 
that all things unto me are spiritual, 
and not at any time have I given unto 
you a law which is temporal." 

In the establishment of this work the 
Lord designed to communicate to the 
Latter-day Saints those principles 
which should control and govern them 
in all the temporal transactions of life. 
Every Latter-day Saint who has the 
spirit of the Gospel can understand the 
necessity of this. I maintain that it is 
an impossibility for men to be engaged 
for six days in the week in the business 
transactions of life and to be controlled 
by the principles which obtain in the 
world, and enjoy the spirit of the Gospel 
upon the Sabbath day and to worship 
Almighty God acceptably. The trouble 
with us is to a certain extent, we are 
Latter-day Saints religiously, but Gen- 
tiles financially. We are not controlled 
in the business affairs of life by that 
spirit of the Gospel which blesses and 
sanctifies all temporal transactions and 
makes them spiritual in the sight of 
God. In my travels among the people 
I have felt that the Sermon on the 
Mount, delivered by the Messiah, was 
the choicest sermon that ever fell from 
the lips of any earthly being. It is 
found in the 5th, 6th and 7th chapters 
of Matthew and also in the third book 
of Nephi. The injunctions He there 
gave are practical, essential, and adapt- 
ed to the wants of the people of God, in 
every dispensation and in every part 
of the earth. The Lord revealed to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith the principles 
upon which the Zion of God could be 



established and perpetuated. He made 
known unto him that there should be 
a common interest in the things of God; 
that every talent should be blessed and 
sanctified to the establishment of the 
work of God upon the earth; that no 
matter what might be the peculiar 
gifts bestowed upon the individual, they 
should all be used in the accomplish- 
ment of the purposes of God. As a peo- 
ple we are diversely gifted. 

I remember reading a revelation in 
this book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
wherein the Lord says that He would 
not make the Prophet Joseph mighty 
in temporal things, because his work 
was in another direction. He was en- 
trusted with the keys and the revela- 
tions of God, many of which had been 
kept hid from the foundation of the 
world, and He laid the foundation of 
this work and gave revelations which 
would enable his successors and the 
people of God for many years to build 
upon it. The Lord revealed to him what 
we call the United Order, by which all 
the time and all the talents of all the 
Saints of God should be employed for 
the general benefit of the cause. I re- 
member reading in this book of a 
branch of the Church that had come up 
from Colesville, in the State of New 
York, and they had made a solemn 
covenant with the Lord that they would 
consecrate their property to His cause, 
but they broke that covenant, and it 
was a very serious sin in the sight of 
God. They had broken a solemn pledge, 
and they were made to realize the ful- 
fillment of the saying that God would 
not be mocked, although it may not 
bave been so serious and swift a judg- 
ment as that pronounced upon Ananias 
and Sapphira in the days of the Apos- 
tles. The effort was made then to es- 
tablsh the United Order. Jesus sought 
to establish the work of God more fully 
than the house of Judah would accept 
it. You remember that He said to 
them: 

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that 
killest the prophets, and stonest them 
which are sent unto thee, how often 
would I have gathered thy children to- 
gether, even as a hen gathereth her 
chickens under her wings, and ye would 
not. 

"38. Behold, your house is left unto 
you desolate. 

"39. For I say unto you, ye shall not 
see me henceforth, till ye shall say, 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



blessed is he that cometh in the name 
of the Lord." 

The day is coming when they will be 
willing to accept the principle of gath- 
ering which they then rejected. But, 
as I have said, the effort was made 
to establish the principles of the United 
Order subsequent to the ascension of 
Jesus. They had, it is said, all things 
in common. On one occasion Ananias 
came to the Apostle Peter ostensibly to 
consecrate all that he had received 
under the blessings of the Almighty. 
The scriptures inform us that he and 
his wife had sold a possession and he 
brought a certain part of it and laid it 
at the feet of the Apostle Peter, who 
was the Presiding Apostle of the 
Church and who had received the keys 
not only to baptize for the remission of 
sins, to lay on hands for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost and to administer the 
sacrament of the Lord's supper, but 
also to administer in those things that 
pertain to the celestial kingdom here 
upon this earth. Now Peter, under the 
influence of the Holy Ghost, discerned 
that the man was not honest in his of- 
fering, and he said unto him: 

"Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine 
heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to 
keep back part of the price of the land? 

"While it remained, was It not thine 
own? And after it was sold, was it not 
in thine own power? Why hast thou 
conceived this thing in thine heart? 
Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto 
God. 

"And Ananias, hearing these words, 
fell down, and gave up the Ghost." 

Shortly afterwards his wife came in, 
and she also lied in relation to this 
business. These are principles my 
brethren and sisters, that are attended 
by the power of God, if they are ob- 
served. But they are attended by the 
judgments of God if they are violated. 
These principles were carried out in the 
City of Enoch until the city was trans- 
lated. They were carried out for a few 
generations upon this continent by the 
Nephites, and the Book of Mormon tells 
us that not one of that generation was 
lost, because they were equal before the 
Lord and labored for the same end. 
The Lord revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph the same principles. The Saints 
of God failed to carry them out be- 
cause of selfishness. The Lord re- 
vealed that Zion never could be redeem- 
ed, only by the law of consecration. 



Because the people were not prepared 
to receive and obey it, Joseph Smith 
and Oliver Cowdery besought the Lord 
to know what He required at their 
hands as a tithing. As a result of that 
condition, He gave the law of tithing 
wherein is required a tenth of all the 
interest of the people annually. The 
Lord specified what the tithing should 
be used for, and that it should be dis- 
bursed under the direction of the Presi- 
dency of the Church. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the peo- 
ple who came to Zion without having 
an eye single to the glory of God lost 
their right to an inheritance. When 
they came up with sinister motives, 
and their hearts were not devoted to the 
work of God, they suffered the disap- 
proval of the Almighty. The same 
statement will apply to us in these 
valleys of the mountains. We have 
been led here by the inspiration of the 
Almighty. The same inspiration has 
controlled and guided the Presidency 
of the Church in locating these Stakes 
of Zion, these cities and towns, through- 
out the length and breadth of this in- 
ter-mountain country. 

God has blessed us with abundance. 
The great majority of the Latter-day 
Saints own their own homes. If you 
were to ask them how many of them 
owned their own homes in their native 
lands, possibly four-fifths of them 
would say that they did not. If you 
were to ask them how many of them 
conducted a profitable business of their 
own before they came here, four-fifths 
would perhaps have to give the same 
answer. Yet in the prosperity that has 
attended us in the establishment of our 
cities, towns and in the building up of 
the Stakes of Zion in this country, we 
have not manifested the gratitude to 
God for his choice blessings which we 
ought to have done. We have an 
abundance of blessings, especially of a 
temporal character, and we ought to 
be willing to comply with the require- 
ments that are made of us, and honestly 
and completely pay our tithing and our 
offerings. 

I rejoice in this work. I rejoice in 
bearing testimony to the truth of the 
Gospel and that we have a Prophet of 
God standing at our head today — Presi- 
dent Lorenzo Snow — who enjoys the in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit and whose

counsel to the Latter-day Saints comes 
from the Lord. May God help us to 
carry it out, and to exemplify in our 
lives the principles which we testify 
God has restored to the earth in these 
last days. I wish to urge the Latter- 
day Saints to teach their sons and theii 
daughters the principles of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. There is a great neces- 
sity today, in the various missions 
abroad, for efficient men to preach the 
Gospel and to represent the people of 
God. Many of the young men that go 
from our Stakes of Zion to preach the 
Gospel have not studied it. They have 
not taken advantage of the opportuni- 
ties afforded them in the Mutual Im- 
provement Association, in the Sunday 
school and in other organizations. I 
am sorry to say that some of them have 
been grossly neglected by their parents. 
I have found Elders who did 
not believe in some of the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel. They said they 
had not been taught to them and they 
had been neglected by their parents. 
They had been engaged in herding 
sheep and other avocations, and had 
not taken pains to prepare themselves. 
The result was there was one principle 
of the Gospel, at least, that they did 
not understand, and consequently they 
did not teach or defend it. To my mind 
this was a very sorrowful condition, 
and it cast reflection upon the parents 
and teachers of those Elders. I do not 
suppose that there is a mission upon 
the earth that would not desire to have 
more Elders than they now have, es- 
pecially Elders who are better qualified 
and more thoroughly indoctrinated in 
the principles of the Gospel and more 
thoroughly imbued with the inspira- 
tion of the Holy Ghost before they leave 
their homes and shoulder the responsi- 
bility of carrying the message of eter- 
nal life to the nations of the earth. I 
know this is the case in the United 
States. I have recently had the privi- 
lege of visiting with President Kelch 
the conferences of the Northern States 
Mission, and I found the Elders labor- 
ing earnestly to spread the Gospel 
among the people of that region. 

Brethren and sisters, let us heed the 
instructions that are given to us at this 
conference and endeavor to apply them 
to our lives, that we may profit thereby. 



God help us to do so, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

AFTERNOON SESSION. 
2 p. m. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

"High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations now look up, 
It waves to all the world." 
Prayer by Elder Joseph W. McMur- 
rin. 

"Glorious things of thee are spoken, 

Zion, city of our God! 
He whose word cannot be broken, 
Chose thee for His own abode," 
was sung by the choir.

Benefit of Having the Livln? Oracles— The Way to 
the Tree of Life— The Oral and the Written 
Word of God— Fulfillment of \neient and 
Modern Revelation — The Law of Tithing. 

I hope I shall be able to make myself 
heard by this vast congregation. I 
was very much interested in the re- 
marks of our brethren this forenoon, 
and the subjects they touched upon are 
of great value and importance to us as 
a people. When Brother Cowley spoke 
he alluded to the blessings we have re- 
ceived in having the living word of God 
in our midst and the Prophet of God 
to lead us. It made me think, do we 
really appreciate this great blessing of 
having inspired men in our midst to 
lead us? Do we give heed to their 
counsel and advice? The brethren have 
dwelt upon the importance of paying 
heed unto the Lord's commandments 
to His people. When He commands, 
He desires His children to obey. Obedi- 
ence to the Father's will is a principle 
that we must all learn. He has not 
left us in the dark in regard to what He 
wants us to do. I believe the Latter- 
day Saints have more faith and a 
stronger testimony than any other peo- 
ple. They received this strong testi- 
mony when the hands of the servants 
of God were laid upon their heads. 
They received the Holy Ghost, which 
leads into all truth and makes known 
the Father's will. So that, while we 
have inspired men in our midst to give 
us the word of the Lord, we are not de-

pendent upon that alone. The Lord has 
given unto us His Holy Spirit to wit- 
ness unto our spirits whether that 
which is given us is right or not. The 
Latter-day Saints who perform their 
duty are not in the dark in regard to 
the counsel which they receive. When 
it comes from the servants of God unto 
them the Holy Spirit gives them a tes- 
timony that it is true. 

Lehi of old had a beautiful dream. 
He saw the world spread before him. 
He stood by a tree — the tree of life — 
enjoyed its precious fruit and saw how 
multitudes were hurrying to get to that 
tree. He saw that there was a mist 
came down that obscured the tree of 
life from the view of the multitude. 
They wanted to reach it, but this dark- 
ness or mist prevented them from see- 
ing it. The Lord, however, had pro- 
vided means whereby they could reach 
it. There was a path leading to the 
tree and at the side of it a rod of iron. 
By taking hold of this and following 
it, although they were not able to see 
the tree, but believing what had been 
told them, that this rod led to the tree 
of life, many found it. But many 
would not take hold of the iron rod, and 
they went astray and did not reach the 
tree with its precious fruit. Lehi saw 
also how that the greater number were 
walking on the other side of a river, 
which divided them from the tree of 
life. They went to a spacious building. 
He saw his own children, Laman and 
Lemuel, and He feared for them when 
he saw that they did not come where 
he was. His wife and his other child- 
ren, shared with him the blessing of 
partaking of the fruit of the tree of 
life. This iron rod, it was explained, 
is the word of God. By taking hold 
of that we need not go astray. Al- 
though we may have to look forward 
with the eye of faith, holding to the 
iron rod we will be just as safe as if 
there were no mist. 

We are blessed, brethren and sisters, 
in having the word of God in our 
midst; not only the written word, but 
also the living word of God. We are 
thankful that we have so much of the 
written word of God in our midst. 
While we do not look upon the Bible as 
many Protestants do, still we have just 
as great reverence for it as they have. 
We have just as great a testimony, 



and greater, that it contains the word 
of God. We revere its contents, and we 
are trying to carry them out in our 
lives. We have testimony of the truth 
of the Bible from other sources, which 
the world do not accept, however. But 
the book itself proves to us that it is 
genuine. Its own prophecies, fulfilled 
since it was written, prove to us that 
it is a book containing the word of God. 
Look at Daniel's prophecy. In what a 
nutshell is the history of the future 
portrayed there? We could not any 
better describe it -today, after we have 
followed history down for more than 
two thousand years. Daniel's prophe- 
cies are like history written before- 
hand, showing that they were inspired. 
The words of Jesus have been fulfilled 
since they were written and given to 
the world. In Matthew we have a clear 
prophecy concerning the Temple and 
the City of Jerusalem. How deeply I 
felt impressed when I sat on Mount 
Olivet and looked down upon the Tem- 
ple ground. I thought of the prediction 
that not one stone of that building 
should be left upon another. This was 
uttered when Jerusalem was flourish- 
ing. It seemed an impossibility that 
such a phophecy could be fulfilled, but 
within forty years it came to pass. The 
Temple, built of large masses of rock, 
was entirely destroyed, the stones car- 
ried away and the Temple ground 
plowed, so as to obliterate any trace of 
the Temple. It was considered policy 
by a Roman emperor to do this, but it 
was the fulfillment of a prophecy of 
Jesus. We look upon the Bible as con- 
taining the word of God written to 
those of old, but much of it in a general 
way applies to us. 

We also believe the Book of Mor- 
mon to contain the word of God. We 
look at its contents and we find that it 
contains internal evidences of its truth, 
that it sets forth, which also show that 
it is a divinely inspired book. Take 
the tenth chapter of second Nephi, and 
you will find that in that book, which 
was published to the world some 
months before the Church of Jesus 
Christ was organized, prophecies con- 
cerning our time. It alludes to this 
land; it designates it as the land of 
Zion and tells how the Gentiles shall 
come and enjoy liberty here; that there 
shall be no king here, and that thos^ 



ELDER AATHON H. LUND.

who fight against Zion shall not suc- 
ceed. The prediction that there shall 
be no kings upon the land has been 
fulfilled even in our day. "When I read 
of Dom Pedro of Brazil having been 
dethroned, and the report went forth 
that being so popular he might again 
take the reigns of government over 
that state, I said that I did not believe 
'that he would do so. I believed that 
the words uttered by Nephi, six hun- 
dred years before Christ, would be ful- 
filled, and that the time was hastening 
when there should not be any kings 
upon this land. When Louis Napoleon 
tried to establish an empire in Mexico 
he miserably failed, and the man who 
tried to become king there lost his life. 

But I specially want to draw your at- 
tention to the allusion to this being a 
land of Zion. It here gives us an in- 
timation of the gathering; that people 
should come from other nations, gather 
to this land, establish a Zion and that 
the Lord should protect them so that 
the enemies of Zion should net have 
power over her. This was years be- 
fore emigration to this country took 
place, but the prophecy has been ful- 
filled. We look upon this as the land 
of Zion, and the principle of gathering, 
though a unique one, has been one 
that has pervaded the teachings and 
belief of the Latter-day Saints from 
the beginning. Even before the Elders 
in their missionary labors have said 
anything about a Zion, the spirit of God 
has witnessed to the spirits of those 
who have received the Gosoel that 
there would be a gathering, but that 
God would have a people of His own 
and that they would be gathered to one 
place. From the very beginning of the 
Gospel being sent to England we have 
evidence to prove this. I have seen in 
my administrations how quickly this 
spirit has taken possession of the 
Saints. And while we do not urge 
gathering today, feeling that the work 
will be strengthened by most of the 
Saints remaining in the branches foi 
a time and helping the Elders carry the 
warning message of the Gospel, yet 
the principle of gathering is just as 
true today as ever it has been. We 
feel, however, that it is better for 
those who receive the Gospel abroad 
to become well grounded in the faith 
before they make the sacrifice of leav- 



ing their homes and their relatives, 
and when they are well grounded in 
the faith and have helped to build up 
the Church where they have received 
the Gospel, we want them to gather 
with us and to make a part of the great 
united Church of God. 

We have also the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, which contains numer- 
ous prophecies that have already been 
fulfilled. Take the 45th Section and 
that alludes to the gathering. The 
first year after the Church was organ- 
ized this revelation was given and it 
plainly tells us that the people should 
gather from all the nations to this land, 
and that no weapon formed against 
Zion should prosper. Take the 49th 
Section, and what a plain prophecy it 
contains! So early in our history we 
are told that Jacob should flourish on 
the mountains — alluding to the people 
coming to the mountains and becoming 
a strong people here, as the Prophet 
Joseph prophesied twelve years after 
the organization of the Church. 

These books we look uoon as con- 
taining the word of God to us. But 
further, we believe that God has living 
witnesses upon the earth; that He has 
a mouth-piece upon the earth to give 
forth His words. Joseph Smith was a 
Prophet of God. His teachings prove 
that what he taught was divinely in- 
spired. Some of his prophecies have 
been fulfilled, and others remain to be 
fulfilled. His predictions have not been 
guesswork. In 1832 he looked down and 
saw the fate of the nation. Earlier than 
that he told us the fate of the Church. 
Now it is reasonable to suppose that if 
the Lord raised up a Prophet, that 
Prophet would say something in re- 
gard to these two important things — 
the nation and the Church, and he did. 
He told how the Church would be per- 
secuted and driven, and that even the 
blood of some should be spilt and 
should cry unto Heaven against those 
who had shed it. He prophesied that 
the Church should go to the Rocky 
Mountains, and he was so much im- 
pressed with the spirit of this that he 
appointed a committee to go and search 
for a place to locate the Saints. He 
did not live to see this accomplished, 
but we have seen this prophecy ful- 
filled. In regard to the nation he plain- 
ly foretold where the Rebellion should

begin and what its results should be. 
Every one can see plainly that part 
of that revelation has been fulfilled 
and the other part remains to be ful- 
filled. Take the successors of the 
Prophet Joseph, and they have been in- 
spired of the Lord to give His word 
unto the people, and we have known 
that it has been the word of the Lord. 

Today, brethren and sisters, the word 
of the Lord to us through His Prophet 
is that we should remember the law of 
tithing. It has been preached to you in 
many of your Stakes, and I am very 
happy to see the response that you have 
made to the call of the servants of the 
Lord. I hope that this will not be 
a temporary effect, but that you will 
all see and appreciate the importance 
of continually obeying the word of the 
Lord. Today we are walking in faith; 
that mist which Nephi saw lies around 
us, but we are shown the iron rod. 
Let us not let go of it and think that 
we can follow in another direction and 
that we will get through any way. If 
you and I shall obtain the privilege of 
eating of that precious fruit of the 
tree of life, we must hold to the iron 
rod. When the servants of God give us 
His word, let us cling to it; let us 
obey His will, and we will have no 
cause for regrets. In the book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants we are taught 
that no religion has salvation in it 
that does not ask for sacrifice. It 
should not be a great sacrifice to us 
to pay our tithing. Great blessings 
have been Dromised those who will 
obey this law. The experience of the 
Saints has been that the Lord has ful- 
filled His promise in this regard. Be- 
fore I close I wish to say to all: if you 
want your faith strengthened, if you 
want your testimony made clearer, pay 
your tithing and the Lord through His 
spirit will witness His approbation of 
your work. God bless you all. Amen. 

ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

What the Word of the Lord Means to the Saints— 
None are Exempt from the Law— The Bondage 
of Debt should be Avoided— The Burdens of 
the Church should be Decreased — Prosperity 
can be Secured. 

This is a very solemn assembly, a 
very important meeting, and one where 
we may consider our standing and fel- 
lowship with each other and with the 
Lord and sit in judgment upon our- 
selves. A passage of scripture comes 



to my mind. It is a saying of one of 
the prophets, written in the Bible, and 
it reads like this: 

"Search me, O God, and know my 
heart; try me, and know my thoughts; 

'And see if there be any wicked way 
in me, and lead me in the way ever- 
lasting." 

This is a very important saying, and 
we may find profit in it by making it 
applicable to ourselves. No doubt 
many of this congregation have had 
testimonies of this work. They have 
seen the power of God made manifest. 
The gifts and blessings of the Gos- 
pel which we have embraced have not 
passed away from the Church. There 
is in the Church all the gifts, blessings 
and graces of the Gospel, and they are 
made manifest in many instances 
among the Saints, and would be more 
so had we more faith and exercised 
more diligence in serving the Lord. 
Every speaker doubtless that you will 
hear during this conference will have 
something to say different from former 
speakers. There are a variety of sub- 
jects in the Gospel that are of vast 
interest to us, and we come to Confer- 
ence from far and near to consider 
that which may be presented to us for 
our guidance, for our profit, and for 
our instruction in the future. Hence 
the speakers do not confine themselves 
entirely to the written word, but speak 
as they are moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost. While listening to my brethren 
I have thought what an important posi- 
tion it is for one to occupy to stand 
before so many people and have their 
time and attention. Surely we ought to 
be inspired of the Lord, so that our 
words may be instructive and interest- 
ing to the people. We are here from 
different parts of the land, agreeable 
to the appointment of our conference, 
and we are here to listen, to make 
notes and to write down what may be 
said that is applicable to our case. 

The brethren who are our leaders, 
you have known for so many years that 
no doubt you have implicit confidence 
in them. We all have Implicit confi- 
dence in the Presidency. We have 
known them for a great many years. 
We knew our beloved President before 
he was drowned in the Pacific ocean. 
President Snow was drowned once; at 
least after he was taken out of the 
water, he was pronounced dead; but 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL.

the Lord brought him to life again and 
has made him mighty in the earth to 
declare His word unto the people. This 
is no vain thing; it is a reality. The 
Lord has a mouthpiece on the earth 
in the person of President Lorenzo 
Snow. Many of the Saints have lately 
heard his voice on a certain subject, 
relative to the welfare of the people of 
God. The Lord spoke to him and he 
spoke to the people. "When President 
Snow was inaugurated as President of 
the Church every one present at that 
time felt a testimony from the Lord 
that he was the right man in the right 
place. I want to bear testimony to you 
that the Lord has spoken to President 
Snow in relation to the law of tithing. 
The Lord has looked down upon the 
people and beheld their condition, and 
seeing that they were straying to a 
certain extent from the laws of the 
Lord, He brought this subject forth 
unto us, and I bear record that it is 
from the Lord. It means, too, just ex- 
actly what it says — that we must from 
this time forth pay our tithes and of- 
ferings to the Lord. Not half do it; 
but do it completely. 

I have had the experience of being a 
Bishop about eighteen years in the 
Church, and the Bishops have to deal 
with tithing matters. I can truthfully 
say, in looking over the history of my 
ministration, as a Bishop, that there 
were very few people indeed who paid 
their tithing. I can call to mind a few 
that in my judgment paid their tithing 
in full, but they were very few in the 
Ward where I presided. This is an 
important matter, my brethren and sis- 
ters. It applies to all of us. No man 
or woman is exempt. I do not know 
of any members of the Church being 
exempt from this law, even if he or 
she has to draw support from the 
Church. The tithing is due on what- 
ever they draw. I say to you that if 
we will from this time on renew our 
diligence in regard to observing this 
law, the Lord will redeem us, and, as 
Brother Lund said, our faith will be in- 
creased. You mark it, the people who 
pay their tithing will have an increase 
of faith and an increase of prosperity. 
It is the shortest and easiest way to 
extricate ourselves from debt and to 
redeem the mortgages on our homes. 
I heard a man bear record to me two 



or three years ago on that point. He 
said: "I have paid my tithing recently, 
and I have been prospered. The way 
is opening up and things are becoming 
more easy with me." 

I would not advise you, my brethren 
and sisters, to worry or to lose any 
sleep over anything, but go along in 
the even tenor of your way, do your 
duty before the Lord and before your 
family, and set an example that is 
worthy of imitation. A great many of 
our people are in bondage. In other 
words, they are in debt. Their homes 
are mortgaged, their farms are mort- 
gaged. This is all wrong. We should 
not place ourselves in bondage. Per- 
haps there are mitigating circum- 
stances in some cases and good rea- 
sons why some people are involved; but 
such cases are few. A great many 
people have entered into these obli- 
gations unwisely. They have spent 
their means unwisely and have nothing 
to show for it. We want to begin to 
redeem ourselves; turn our faces to 
the Lord and intreat the Lord about 
our affairs. There is no wrong in going 
into our secret places and telling the 
Lord our circumstances, and if you 
will do this, you will find relief. You 
will have the suggestions of the Spirit, 
and ways will be opened up that you 
will not have thought of. If you will 
pay your tithing honestly before the 
Lord, He will hear and answer your 
prayers and the day will come when this 
oeople will be redeemed and their 
mortgages will be lifted. For the Lat- 
ter-day Saints are a good people and 
the Lord loves them. If we were not a 
good people, we would not have the 
promise of being forgiven. I think I 
have heard President Snow say that 
if we would do better now, the Lord 
would forgive us for the past. This is 
an intimation that the Lord loves His 
people, because there are many pure 
and devoted Latter-day Saints among 
them. Of course, we are not all what 
we ought to be, but we may become 
what we ought to be by turning our 
attention to our duty in the callings of 
the Priesthood. 

The idea has been common in the past 
that the Church could do everything— 
it could build every meeting house and 
every tabernacle almost throughout the 
land. Numerous applications were 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



made to the Church, and in the good- 
ness and sympathy of the souls of the 
Presidency and brethren they have con- 
ceded to our wishes in many instances, 
and tens of thousands of dollars have 
been appropriated to the people that we 
could have got along without. Now, I 
know a little about the affairs of the 
Church; not a great deal; but if you 
Bishops and Presidents of Stakes will 
take my counsel, you will not ask the 
Trustee-in-Trust for anything until his 
hands are relieved. We do not want 
him weighed down with obligations. We 
want to hold up his hands; to lift the 
Church from under its obligations, and 
to become a free people. We want to 
become lenders, and not borrowers, and 
we can do it, if we will set ourselves 
to accomplish the work. The Lord does 
not require, nor never has required, 
anything of us but what we can accom- 
plish if we set our hearts to the work. 
We need to be very careful and very 
economical in our own affairs, and we 
will prosper in the land. 

The people in the north, and perhaps 
in the south, have met with some re- 
verses this year on account of the frost 
destroying their crops to a certain ex- 
tent. I have heard it said that in one 
of the Stakes of Zion there is at least 
ten thousand dollars worth of grain in- 
jured by the frost. A great many of 
the brethren perhaps are more or less 
discouraged because of this. We say 
to you brethren, be comforted, and be 
of good cheer. The hand of the Lord 
is in all these things and prosperity 
will come to you. Your fields shall be 
fruitful and the frost shall be stayed, 
because of your diligence in serving the 
Lord. He brings things upon ns some- 
times to try our faith and our devotion 
to His work; but He will lift us up, 
and we will be placed on a plane w here 
we will have joy and consolation in the 
goodness and mercy of the Lord to us. 
Who that has watched the course cf 
events for the last forty or fifty years 
has not seen the hand of the Lord over 
this people in these mountain valleys, 
where, in early times, it was thought 
impossible to raise grain or vegetables? 
These valleys have been made fruitful; 
the elements have been tempered to the 
good of the people, the blessings of the 
Lord have been upon the land and the 



people as a whole are becoming 
wealthier every year, getting better 
homes, better surroundings, better 
meeting houses, better school houses 
and everything better. The blessings of 
the Lord are upon us, if we can only 
acknowledge the hand of the Lord in 
them. 

My brethren and sisters, I do not 
want to weary you at this time, but I 
want to see the Saints prosper. I know 
this work is true. I learned this many 
years ago. I left the grave of my 
father, the fireside of my mother, a 
boy alone in the world, without a cent 
in my pocket, to associate myself with 
the Latter-day Saints. Why? Because 
I had a testimony from the Lord that 
this work was true, that Joseph Smith 
was a great Prophet of God, and that 
his brethren of the Twelve were great 
men of God and Seers and Revelators. 
The Church will never be left without 
a Prophet nor without Seers and Reve- 
lators. My life has not been all smooth 
sailing. I have had the hard and the 
rough times in the early days here, 
but I have had testimony upon testi- 
mony that this work is from God. If 
you do not know it is true, it is be- 
cause you have not sought as dili- 
gently as you ought to do. Every 
member of the Church may know that 
this is the work of God. Every young 
man may know it, whether he goes on 
a mission or stays at home, every 
young woman may have divine evi- 
dence from the Lord. You all may 
know it, if you will seek for it earnest- 
ly and devotedly. What greater bles- 
sing can we have than to be able to 
give a reason for the hope that we 
have. Whether we live or die, it mat- 
ters not, so long as we are in the line 
of duty, and so long as we can say: 
"Search me, O God, and know my 
heart; try me, and know my thoughts; 
and see if there be any wicked way in 
me." 

May the Lord bless us and fill us with 
His power and manifest His blessings 
unto us, that we may go home with the 
spirit of this conference and dissemin- 
ate it throughout the land, that there 
may be an awakening among the peo- 
ple, and that the Lord may approve of 
us and our labors and bless us accord- 
ingly. God bless you. Amen.

Effects Produced by the Lives of G-reai Characters 
— Blessings of God Secured by Obedience— When 
the Lord gives Commands He opens the way for 
the Obedient to Fulfill them. 

I rejoice exceedingly at again having 

the opportunity of meeting with the 
JLatter-day Saints in General Con- 
ference. I have listened with a great 
deal of pleasure to the remarks that 
have been made by the brethren who 
have spoken, and I earnestly desire that 
the time which I occupy may be for our 
mutual benefit, to strengthen us in the 
faith of the Gospel, and to inspire us 
with a determination to press forward 
in the discharge of the many duties and 
responsibilities resting upon us as 
members of the Church. We all, no 
doubt, look around in life and from our 
observation of men, or from our read- 
ing of the lives of those who have died, 
form our ideals, and we try to live and 
to be like those whom we admire. There 
is no character with which I have been 
familiar through my reading that has 
inspired me more than has Nephi of 
old. I can never read the life of that 
man without being inspired with a de- 
sire to be faithful, diligent and true to 
the Lord, that I may be abundantly 
blessed of the Lord, as was Nephi. If 
we all could be inspired with a deter- 
mination to live as this man lived, there 
is no question in my mind but we would 
grow and increase in the Spirit of God, 
and in power and ability to do the will 
of our Heavenly Father on the earth. 
Alma says that the Lord granteth un- 
to men according to their desires, 
whether they be for life or death, for 
joy or remorse of conscience. As Lat- 
ter-day Saints, let us have a desire to 
live lives of usefulness, and to be in- 
struments in the hands of God of ac- 
complishing much good. 

I have read and spoken time and time 
again from the section of the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants from which 
Brother Woodruff read this morning. 
I have felt a desire in my heart to be 
anxiously engaged in a good cause, 
and to bring to pass much righteous- 
ness of my own free will. I have en- 
deavored to impress this also upon the 
minds of those with whom I have been 
laboring since being called to minister 
among the people. I desire to read a 
few words more from this same section. 



After telling us to be anxiously engaged 
in a good cause, and not to wait to be 
commanded in all things, the Lord says: 

'Who am I that made man, saith the 
Lord, that will hold him guiltless that 
obeys not my commandments? 

"Who am I, saith the Lord, that have 
promised and have not fulfilled? 

"I command and a man obeys not, I 
revoke and they receive not the bles- 
sing. 

"Then they say in their hearts, this 
is not the work of the Lord, for His 
promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto 
such, for their reward lurkeui beneath, 
and not from above." 

I know scores of Latter-day Saints 
who have been commanded of the Lord 
time and time again, but nave failed to 
receive the blessings promised through 
the fulfillment of the commandments of 
God, because they have obeyed not. Yet 
they have accused the Lord of failing to 
fulfill His promises made to those who 
obey His commandments. I have ever 
known that those who pay not their 
tithing are the ones that criticise the 
expenditure of the tithing. Those who 
are approached for donations for lauda- 
ble purposes, sometimes under the di- 
rection of the Presidency of the Church, 
and who refuse to contribute, are the 
ones that criticise the Presidency of 
the Church and the Apostles for calling 
upon them for means. But I find that 
the men who obey are those who testify 
that the promises of God are fulfilled. 
Therefore, it behooves each and every 
one of us to be true and energetic. 

I desire to read a few words from the 
writings of the Prophet Nephi. After 
hearing the testimony of his rather, and 
after they had gone into the wilderness 
Nephi says: 

"16. And it came to pass that I Nephi, 
being exceeding young, nevertheless 
being large in stature, and also having 
great desires to know of the mysteries 
of God, wherefore I did cry unto the 
Lord; and behold he did visit me, and 
did soften my heart that I did believe 
all the words which had been spoken 
by my father, wherefore I did not rebel 
against him like unto my brothers. 

"17. And I spake unto Sam, making 
known unto him the things which the 
Lord had manifested unto me by his 
Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that 
he believed in my words; 

"18. But behold Laman and Lemuel 
would not hearken unto my words; and 
being grieved because of the hardness 
of their hearts, I cried unto the Lord 
for them. 

"19. And it came to pass that the Lord 



is 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spake unto me, saying, blessed art 
thou, Nephi, because of thy t'aith, for 
thou hast sought me diligently, with 
lowliness of heart. 

"20. And inasmuch as ye shall keep 
my commandments — " 

This is the point that I desire to im- 
press upon your minds. 

"And inasmuch as ye shall keep my 
commandments, ye shall prosper, and 
shall be led to a land of promise; yea, 
even a land which I have prepared for 
you; yea, a land which is choice above 
all other lands." 

I say to the Latter-day Saints that 
this last statement is one of the 
testimonies of the truthfulness of 
this record, because this is a land 
choice above all other lands, and 
God has blessed the people upon 
this land. He has fulfilled the words 
recorded in this book time and time 
again, that those who should come up to 
fight against the people of this land 
should not prosper. After Nephi had 
been thus abundantly blessed of the 
Lord, when he returned to his father, 
who had received a command- 
ment from the Lord that his sons 
should go back to Jerusalem for the 
brass plates, Laman and Lemuel 
were murmurirg against this command- 
ment. But these are the words of 
Nephi: 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
said unto my father, I will go and do 
the things which the Lord hath com- 
manded, for I know that the Lord 
giveth no commandments unto the chil- 
dren of men, save He shall prepare 
a way for them that they may accom- 
plish the thing which he commandeth 
them. 

"And it came to pass that when my 
father had heard these words he was 
exceeding glad, for he knew that I 
had been blessed of the Lord." 

We will all be blessed of the Lord if 
we have this same spirit and realize 
that no obstacles are insurmountable 
when God commands and we obey. I 
heard Brother Lyman once remark in 
a meeting of the Quorum of the Apos- 
tles, that he knew of no man who had 
ever been blessed by one of the Quorum 
of the Apostles or by the Presidency of 
the Church and had been sent out to 
fulfill a mission that had failed to do so. 
There might .be those whose hearts 
they did touch, but there were those 
whose hearts could be reached. There 
never was a member of the Quorum of 
the Apostles sent upon a mission, but 



what sooner or later fulfilled that mis- 
sion. This is a testimony of the state- 
ment of Nephi: "For I know that the 
Lord giveth no commandments unto the 
children of men, save He shall prepare 
a way for them that they may accom- 
plish the thing which He commandeth 
them." Let us realize this and that the 
keeping of the commandments of God 
will bring- to us the light and inspira- 
tion of His Spirit. Then the desire of 
our hearts will be to know the mind 
and will of the Lord, and we will pray 
for strength and ability to carry it out, 
thereby lollowing in the footsteps of our 
Lord and Master Jesus Christ. After 
the sons of Lehi had gone up to try 
and get the plates and were driven 
back, and Nephi's brethren desired to 
return to their father, Nephi said unto 
them. ,. 

"That as the Lord liveth, and as we 
live.we will not go down unto our father 
in the wilderness, until we have accom- 
plished the thing which the Lord hath 
commanded us. 

"Wherefore let us be faithful in keep- 
ing the commandments of the Lord." 

Here is the key: Nephi knew how 
to be successful. Let us therefore be 
faithful in keeping the commandments 
of the Lord. 

"Therefore let us go down to the land 
of our father's inheritance, for behold, 
he left gold and silver and all manner 
of riches. And all this he hath done be- 
cause of the commandments of the 
Lord." 

After they had been driven the second 
time and Laban had stolen their gold 
and silver that they had offered him for 
the plates, Laman and Lemuel mur- 
mured again, and said that Laban could 
command his fifty and would slay them. 
And Nephi replied: 

"Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, 
and let us be faithful in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord; for be- 
hold he is mightier than all the earth,, 
then why not mightier than Laban and 
his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of 
thousands." 

That is the kind of faith to have. Let 
us be faithful in keeping the command- 
ments of God and then we know that 
we can win the battle, though we may 
be opposed by a man with his tens of 
thousands. The final result was that 
Nephi got the plates. We find recorded 
here also that Nephi was commanded 
of the Lord to build a vessel. His 
brethren laughed at him when they 
saw he was sorrowful because they 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



19 



refused to help him to build the vessel. 
Nephi said to them: 

"Behold, my soul is rent with anguish 
because of you, and my heart is pained; 
for I fear lest ye shall be cast off for- 
ever. Behold, I am full of the Spirit 
of God, insomuch that my frame has no 
strength." 

Nephi continues: 

"And now it came to pass that when 
I had spoken these words, they were 
angry with me and were desirous to 
throw me into the depths of the sea; 
and as they came forth to lay their 
hands upon me, I spake unto them, say- 
ing: In the name of the Almighty God, 
I command you that ye touch me not, 
for I am filled with the power of God 
even unto the consuming of my flesh; 
and whoso shall lay their hands upon 
me, shall wither even as a dried reed; 
and he shall be as naught before the 
power of God, for God shall smite him. 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
said unto them, that they should mur- 
mur no more against their father: 
neither should they withhold their labor 
from me, for God had commanded me 
that I should build a ship." 

On another occassion when Nephi 
was in affliction, having been bound by 
his brethren on the ship, and they un- 
bound him because they were afraid of 
the storm, Nephi said: 

"Wherefore they came unto me, and 
loosed the bands which were upon my 
wrists; and behold they had swollen 
exceedingly; and also mine ankles were 
much swollen, and great was the sore- 
ness thereof. 

"Nevertheless I did look unto my God, 
and I did praise Him all the day long; 
and I did not murmur against the Lord, 
because of mine afflictions." 

"We find here a man of faith; a man 
who submits to affliction without mur- 
muring. In all his history we find that 
he followed the commandments of the 
Lord. The Lord said to him in the be- 
ginning that if he followed His 
commandments he should be prospered 
in the land, and he was prospered. I wish 
to bear my testimony to the Latter-day 
Saints that all of us who will obey the 
commandments of God will be pros- 
pered in the land. Sacrifice doth bring 
forth the blessings of heaven. I bear 
my testimony to the truth of what 
Brother Lund has said today, that if 
the people will pay their tithes and of- 
ferings, they will not only be blessed in 
their material affairs, but they will be 
abundantly blessed with increased out- 
pouring of the Spirit of the Lord. We 
find recorded in Section 130 of the book 



of Doctrine and Covenants, the follow- 
ing: 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed 
in heaven before the foundation of this 
world, upon which all blessings are pre- 
dicated; 

"21. And when we obtain any blessing 
from God, it is by obedience to that law 
upon which it is predicated." 

I bear witness to you, as a.n Apostle 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that material 
and spiritual prosperity is predicated 
upon the fulfillment of the duties and 
responsibilities that rest upon us as 
Latter-day Saints. I have rejoiced ex- 
ceedingly that the debts which the peo- 
ple owe to the Lord in tithing have been 
forgiven by the Prophet of God. But 
I want to say to those who are able to 
pay those debts, it will be a great deal 
better for them if they will do so, not- 
withstanding they have been forgiven. 
If the Lord will help me, I propose to 
pay every debt that I owe in the world. 
I propose with the help of the Lord to 
be true to my fellowmen in fulfilling 
every obligation that I have entered in- 
to with them. But above all and be- 
yond all, I propose to fulfill my obliga- 
tion, to the be6t of my ability, to God 
my Heavenly Father. I have been ridi- 
culed in the public prints because I said 
that a man's duty was to pay his debts 
to the Lord if he did not pay his debts 
to his fellowman. I repeat that. God 
my Heavenly Father has blessed me 
with a knowledge of the Gospel. I do 
know that God lives; I do know that 
Jesus is the Christ; I do know that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God; 
I do know that Lorenzo Snow is a 
Prophet of God; I know that God loves 
me; that He blesses me; that I am one 
of His children; that I am under obli- 
gations to Him; and that all I have 
on earch, all that I will ever receive 
here or hereafter, I am indebted to Him 
for it. Therefore, I say, shall I not ful- 
fill the duties and obligations that I 
owe to my Creator and loving Parent 
before I fulfill my obligations to my fel- 
lowman. lias any man ever loaned 
me money because he loved me? No; he 
has loaned it to me because he wanted 
his interest. With the help of the Lord 
I propose to keep the commandments 
of the Lord, and then I do know that 
I shall oe able to pay all that I owe; 
because I know that God blesses those 
who keep His commandments. I know 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that I nev^r made a sacrifice of a finan- 
cial nature in my life to help the ad- 
vancement of God's work, without be- 
ing abundantly rewarded therefor. Not 
only materially, but I grew in the 
knowledge of the Gospel and in the 
Spirit of God, which is worth more than 
all the wealth and honors of men. I de- 
sire never to allow my heart to wither 
up, so to speak, but rather to have it 
grow and expand. I desire to seek first 
the kingdom of God. I do know and 
bear witness to you that if I do it, all 
other things for my good will be added 
unto me. And what I bear witness to 
pertaining to myself, I bear witness to 
for all the Latter-day Saints. If you 
desire the Spirit of God, be honest in 
keeping the commandments of God. If 
you desire prosperity, and at the same 
time the testimony of the Gospel, pay 
all your obligations to God and you 
shall have it. If you are not honest 
with God, you may prosper and you 
may be blessed with the things of this 
world, but they will crowd out from 
your heart the spirit of the Gospel; you 
will become covetous of your own 
means and lose the inspiration of Al- 
mighty God. The Savior told us that if 
we gained the whole world and lost our 
own souls, it would profit us nothing. 
We have started out for life eternal, the 
greatest of all the gifts of God to man, 
and keeping the commandments of God 
will brins- it to us. May God bless 
you. Amt.n.

"1. Listen to the voice of Jesus 
Christ, your Lord, your God, and your 
Redeemer, whose word is quick and 
powerful. 

"2. For, behold, I say unto you, that 
it mattereth not what ye shall eat, or 
what ye shall drink, when ye partake 
of the sacrament, if it so be that ye 
do it with an eye single to my glory; 
remembering unto the Father my body 
which was laid down for you, and my 
blood which was shed for the remission 
of your sins: 

"3. Wherefore, a commandment I give 
unto you, that you shall not purchase 
wine, neither strong drink or your ene- 
mies: 

"4. Wherefore, ye shall partake of 



none, except it is made new among you; 
yea, in this my Father's kingdom which 
shall be built up on the earth. 

"5. Behold, this is wisdom in me: 
wherefore, marvel not, for the hour 
cometh that I will drink of the fruit of 
the vine with you on the earth, and 
with Moroni, whom I have sent unto 
you to reveal the Book of Mormon, con- 
taining the fullness of my everlasting 
gospel, to whom I have committed the 
keys of the record of the stick of Eph- 
raim; 

"6. And also with Elias, to whom I 
have committed the keys of bringing 
to pass the restoration of all things, 
spoken by the mouth of all the holy 
Prophets since the world began, con- 
cerning the last days: 

"7. And also John the son of Zach- 
arias, which Zacharias he (Elias) visit- 
ed and gave promise that he should 
have a son, and his name should be 
John, and he should be filled with the 
spirit of Elias; 

"8. Which John I have sent unto you, 
my servants, Joseph Smith, Jr., and 
Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto this 
first priesthood which you have re- 
ceived, that you might be called and 
ordained even as Aaron: 

"9. And also Elijah, unto whom I 
have committed the keys of the power 
of turning the hearts of the fathers to 
the children, and the hearts of the 
children to the fathers, that the whole 
earth may not be smitten with a curse: 

"10. And also with Joseph and Jacob, 
and Isaac, and Abraham, your fathers, 
by whom the promises remain; 

"11. And also with Michael, or Adam, 
the father of all, the prince of all, the 
ancient of days. 

"12. And also with Peter, and James, 
and John, whom I have sent unto you, 
by whom I have ordained you and con- 
firmed you to be Apostles, and especial 
witnesses of my name, and bear the 
keys of your ministry, and of the same 
things which I revealed unto them: 

"13. Unto whom I have committed 
the keys of my kingdom, and a dispen- 
sation of the Gospel for the last time; 
and for the fullness of times, in the 
which I will gather together in one all 
things, both which are in heaven, and 
which are on earth: 

"14. And also with all those whom 
my Father hath given me out or the 
world: 

"15. Wherefore, lift up your hearts 
and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and 
take upon you my whole armor, that 
ye may be able to withstand the evil 
clay, having done all ye may be able to 
stand. 

"16. Stand, therefore, having your 
loins girt about with truth, having on 
the breastplate of righteousness, and 
your feet shod with the preparation of 
the Gospel of peace, which I have sent 
mine angels to commit unto you. 

"17. Taking the shield of faith where- 
with ye shall be able to quench all the 
fiery darts of the wicked;

"18. And take the helmet of salvation, 
and the sword of my spirit, which I will 
pour out upon you, and my word which 
I reveal unto you, and he agreed as 
touching- all things whatsoever ye ask 
of me, and be faithful until T come, and 
ye shall he caught up. that where I am 
ye shall be also. Amen." 

Thus said the Lord many years ago. 
This everlasting Gospel that was re- 
stored to the earth through the agency 
of Moroni, John the Baptist, and Peter, 
James and John, has brought about this 
wonderful gathering that we see at this 
conference. We can congratulate each 
other that we have this glorious privi- 
lege today. The Lord Jesus Christ said: 
"No man can come unto me. except mv 
Father draw him." How is it that we 
have accepted the principles of ever- 
lasting life? Forty-seven years' ex- 
perience I have had with this people, 
and T know most assuredly that the 
Priesthood of the Son of God has been 
restored to the earth, and that this 
work that we are engaged In is the 
work of the Lord, which Tsaiah spoke 
about when he said that the Lord would 
commence a marvelous work and a 
wonder, in which the wisrlom of the 
wise should perish and the understand- 
in? of the prudent should be brought to 
nought. Our Father in Heaven is doing 
his own work. That 1 want to say to 
my beloved brethren and sisters who 
have gathered together here for the 
purpose of worshiping the Lord at this 
conference. God has manifested his 
love unto us. How did these brethren 
who have spoken obtain the testimony 
which they have borne at the confer- 
ence in the power and spirit of God? It 
is because God has loved them and 
given unto them his spirit. How is it 
that these Presidents of Stakes and 
their counselors. High Councilors and 
the Bishops and their counselors have 
this glorious privilege of assembling to- 
gether at this conference to hear the 
word of the Lord and to represent their 
respective fields of labor? It is by the 
grace of God. By His grace we are 
saved and have the privilege of a stand- 
ing In the Church. It is our Father in 
Heaven who has drawn us into His 
fold, adopted us into His royal family 
and given unto us the Holy Priesthood, 
with the blessings and keys of endless 
life. He has also given unto us the 
understanding heart. He has filled ua 



with His divine love, and has granted 
unto us the glorious gifts of faith, 
hope and charity. We gladly gather to- 
gether to wait upon the Lord, to hear 
His word and to understand His coun- 
sel. 

Before coming to this meeting we 
have been on our knees, pleading with 
the Almighty that He would pour His 
spirit and blessing upon His servants 
who should speak, that they might 
faithfully deliver His word unto the 
people. We have had the word of God 
given unto us, and I bear testimony 
that this word is true, that we should 
repent of our robbing the Lord in tithes 
and offerings and that we shoiild turn 
unto Him with full purpose of heart, 
consecrating unto Him one-tenth of 
everything that the Lord shall give unto 
us, by which we would be enabled to 
sanctify the land, so that His statutes 
might be kept thereon. This is the word 
of the Lord to us, and it will naturally 
bring division. There will be those who 
will hear the word of God and do it, 
and there will be those who will reject 
the word of God and count it as a light 
thing, making any frivolous excuse for 
despising the ordinances of the house 
of God. The Lord told His people 
through Malachi that when they robbed 
Him in tithes and offerings they were 
laboring under a curse, and the Lord 
has told us that if we do not honor this 
law it shall not be a land of Zion unto 
us, and our enemies shall prevail 
against us, but if we love Him and keep 
His commandments we shall prevail 
against our enemies. 

I do not know that we should have 
any enemies. T am not aware that we 
do any harm. We are striving all the 
time to set a righteous example, teach- 
ing the people correct principles. We 
take our lives in our hands and go 
forth to the nations of the earth with 
this glad message of great joy to the 
people, that God hath spoken and that 
He has restored to the earth His holy 
Gospel. We promise them that if they 
will obey the Gospel and live the prin- 
ciples of righteousness they shall have 
a living testimony and shall know, as 
we know, that God lives, that Jesus is 
the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a 
true Prophet sent of God, that the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times is 
being ushered in, and that the peoplf

are being- prepared for everlasting- life 
or for death, for a glorious resurrec- 
tion or a resurrection of everlasting 
shame. There are two resurrections, 
the resurrection of the just and the 
resurrection of the unjust. How could 
we expect a part in the resurrection of 
the just, unless we were just to our 
God and to each other? 

Vain theories will never Uo us any 
good. Foolish dogmas never saved any- 
body or anything. "We can only be 
sanctified by the truth as it is in Christ 
Jesus. The Lord hath said "Look unto 
me all ye ends of the earth, for beside 
me there is no Savior." Why do not 
the inhabitants of the earth look unto 
him? "Why do they not have faith 
in Him? Because it is not their tradi- 
tion. "Without faith it is impossible to 
please God." I was not educated to be- 
lieve that it was essential that I should 
enjoy the spirit of revelation myself; 
that I had the privilege of communion 
with God my Eternal Father and ob- 
taining light and intellig?nce from H ; m; 
and that if I would sancrlty myself be- 
fore the Lord and keep His command- 
ments I should receive line upon line, 
precept upon precept, here a little and 
there a little. I ask you. my beloved 
brethren and sisters, if we do not grow 
gradually in the knowledge of God? We 
do not receive it in a day; we must 
have experience, and therefore I think 
our persecutions are all right. Jesus 
Christ said: "It must needs be that 
offenses come, but wo unto them by 
whom they come." We have to be edu- 
cated in this line. If we were not op- 
pressed, misrepresented, lied about and 
slandered, we never would have sym- 
pathy for others in the same condition. 
My sympathies go out to the patriot and 
to the lover of liberty who believes in 
sustaining the constitution that was 
given of Almighty God. I # do not sym- 
pathize with the hypocrite. Jesus 
Christ said: "Beware of the leaven of 
the Pharisees," (hypocrisy) and we 



might say, beware of the leaven of the 
Gentiles. Let us be what we seem to 
be. If we are patriots, let us stand by 
correct principles, and let this be a 
land of religious liberty to all man- 
kind. Let it be the land of the free 
and the home of the brave, truly and 
literally, and let those that are weak 
be protected. That was the determina- 
tion when the Constitution was writ- 
ten. The more I study and understand 
the Constitution of the United States, 
the more I revere it. I am something 
like Bishop Edward Hunter, who said, 
"Too good, too good, for a bad people." 
It is a glorious document, and one that 
we are under obligation to sustain. 
Every American citizen promises to 
sustain the Constitution of the United 
States. Every officer in the country 
makes that oath and covenant. That 
is done for the protection of the weak 
and to prevent religious persecution. It 
was so in the beginning, and wo unto 
those who trample upon that Constitu- 
tion. 

God bless us in our individual re- 
sponsibilities. We shall all have to 
stand before the bar of God and give 
an account of the deeds done in the 
body. All men, whether they be princes 
on their thrones, or beggars in the 
street, have got to meet the covenants 
that they have made. The choir here 
sings sometimes, "Who shall ascend in- 
to the hill of the Lord? Or who shall 
stand in His holy place? He that hath 
clean hands and a pure heart; who hath 
not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor 
sworn deceitfully." That is it. 

Let us be kind to ourselves; let us 
fear God and keep his commandments, 
and when He requires anything at our 
hands by His grace, let us perform it. 
Unto this end may God sustain us, for 
Christ's sake. Amen. 

The chior sang: 

"Let the mountains shout for joy." 
Benediction by Patriarch John Smith. 



SECOND DAY. 



Saturday, October 7, 10 a.m. 

Conference was called to order by 
President George Q. Cannon. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

"We thank Thee, O God, for a Pro- 
phet, 

To guide us in these latter-days; 
We thank Thee for sending the Gos- 
pel, 

To lighten our minds with its rays." 
Prayer by Elder Charles W. Penrose. 
Singing by the choir: 

"Come, dearest Lord, descend and 
dwell, 

By faith and love, in every heart; 
Then shall we know and taste and feel 
The joys that cannot be expressed." 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

How the Land of Zion shall be Redeemed — The 
Law of Consecration — Ths Law of Tlihing — 
Persecutions in the Past ;md the Cause of 
Them— Gratifying Effects of Recent Preaching 
— Not th-i Business of saints to Eight their 
Enemies. 

Brethren and sisters: I wish, as I al- 
ways do in coming before an audience of 
Latter-day Saints, your faith and pray- 
ers, that I may say such things as will 
be a comfort and a blessing. A day or 
two before this conference, in thinking 
upon what I might wish to say to the 
Latter-day Saints, it occurred to me 
that perhaps I had said about enough 
in reference to the matter of tithing, 
and that I would not confine myself to 
that subject, as I have spoken to the 
Latter-day Saints in conferences of all 
the large Stakes and also here in Salt 
Lake City at a Stake Conference. I felt 
that it might not be necessary to talk 
upon this subject, but that it would be 
proper for two of my brethren, who 
were with me at St. George and since, 
to talk upon it once more in their lives, 
and I have so requested them. Now, 
I feel it my duty to say something still 
myself in reference to this most import- 
ant subject of all, under the present 
condition, that can be laid before the 
Latter-day Saints. I will read a few 
verses in the 63rd Section of the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants, commenc- 
ing with the 25th verse; 



25. "Behold the land of Zion, I, the 
Lord, holdeth it in mine own hands; 

26. "Nevertheless, I the Lord, render- 
eth unto Ceasar the things which are 
Caesar's; 

27. "Wherefore, I the Lord, willeth 
that you shuold purchase the lands that 
you may have the advantage of the 
world, that you may have claim on 
the world, that they may not be stirred 
up unto anger; 

28. "For Satan putteth it into their 
hearts to anger against you, and to the 
shedding of blood; 

29. "Wherefore the land of Zion shall 
not be obtained but by purchase or by 
blood, otherwise there is none inheri- 
tance for you. 

30. "And if by purchase, behold you 
are blessed; 

31. "And if by blood, as you are for- 
bidden to shed blood, lo, your enemies 
are upon you, and ye shall be scourged 
from city to city, and from synagogue 
to synagogue, and but few shall stand 
to receive an inheritance." 

We learn from these verses that the 
Lord determined that the Latter-day 
Saints could secure the land of Zion 
only by two ways: One by purchase, 
the other by the shedding of blood. The 
Lord also determined that possession of 
that country should not be gained ex- 
cept by the purchase of the land. It 
should be bought and paid for by the 
means furnished by the Latter-day 
Saints, whether rich or poor. It should 
be bought as other people buy land. 
The Lord would not permit them to 
take possession of the land by force, 
or by antagonizing the people's inter- 
ests. The Lord expressly stated that 
He had no other object in view than 
that the Latter-day Saints should ob- 
tain it upon the principle of purchase. 
Even if it took every cent they pos- 
sessed, they should not secure It by the 
shedding of men's blood. And if you 
and I ever get any possession upon the 
land of Zion, it will be by purchase, not 
by force. This has been the will of the 
Lord from the beginning. He has never 
allowed his people to take possession of 
any property by force. When the Child- 
ren of Israel were taken from Egyptian 
bondage and promised an inheritance in 
what is called the "land flowing with 
milk and honey," it was not the design 
of the Lord that they should get posses- 
sion of that land by force. Upon the 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



banks of the Red Sea, after they had 
crossed over by the miraculous inter- 
position of providence, he presented to 
them the same principles of salvation 
and exaltation as he has presented to 
us. But they rejected those principles, 
and then he told them what should be 
the results of that rejection. He pro- 
posed to make them a nation of king's 
and priests, and there is only one way 
to do that, and that is through the ever- 
lasting- Gospel in all its fullness. 

He told them that he would send the 
hornet before them to drive out the peo- 
ple from the land that he proposed to 
bestow upon them. But. as I have said, 
they rejected the principles that were 
presented to them, and therefore the 
Lord, through their disobedience, was 
compelled to give them another law. 

We are told in the 29th verse, which 
I have read: 

"Wherefore the land of Zion shall not 
he obtained (not mav not be, or can not 
be. hut shall not bp"* but bv purchase 
or by blood, otherwise there is none 
inheritance for you." 

That which T have read from the 63rd 
Section has been literally fulfilled. The 
Lord provided a way whereby they 
could secure the means tn purchase 
that country, namely by the law of 
consecration. There was no one man 
in the Church that could have bought 
that land; there were no two men, or 
half a dozen men, or a hundred men 
that could have bought it. The people 
as a general thing were poor. There 
were no rich men that received the Gos- 
pel in those early days. But by combin- 
ation and union they could have secured 
the means to carry out the purposes 
of the Almighty in regard to the pur- 
chase of that country. They failed be- 
cause of their love for money. In a re- 
velation after this we are told that they 
failed to give their names as they were 
commanded. The Lord sent Elders 
throughout the States, where there were 
Latter-day Saints to collect means 
for this purpose, and the people in Jack- 
son County were required to observe 
the law of consecration. But they fail- 
ed to do it, and therefore the lands were 
not secured. The Lord could have sus- 
tained the people against the encroach- 
ments of their enemies had they placed 
themselves in a condition where he 
would have been justified In doing so. 



But inasmuch as they would not com- 
ply with His requirements, the Lord 
could not sustain them against their 
enemies. So it will be with us, or with 
any people whom the Lord calls to com- 
ply with His requirements and whom 
He proposes to confer the highest bless- 
ings upon, as He has in reference to us, 
and as He did in reference to the people 
in Jackson County. 

There having been a failure in regard 
to this law of consecration — a failure so 
serious that it resulted in great misery 
to the people of God — a few years after 
that the Lord gave another law for the 
Saints to observe in place of the law of 
consecration. It is called the law of 
tithing. If we look upon this law in its 
proper light, we will see the importance 
of it and the danger that will result if 
we fail to observe it. It would hardly 
be justice in our Heavenly Father if He 
were to deal with the Latter-day Saints 
now in any way different from that in 
which He dealt with His ppople in Jack- 
son County. If we find out what result- 
ed from their failure in the law of con- 
secration, we may, I think, very read- 
ily and reasonably conclude what will 
be the result of a failure in reference 
to this law that has been put before us 
in place of the law of consecration. I 
dare say that it seems to some persons 
who are not in the habit of reflecting 
much that the Lord is severe under cer- 
tain circumstances. When we consider 
what transpired here a few years ago 
in this beautiful country and the dis- 
tress that was visited upon the men, 
women and children, we might think 
there was some severity about that. 
The same in reference to what followed 
a disobedience to this law of consecra- 
tion in the early days of the Church. 
The Lord told the Saints who 
formed that colony in Jackson 
County what should be the results if 
they failed to observe the law of con- 
secration. He said: "Ye shall be 
scourged from city to city and from 
synagogue to synagogue, and but few 
shall stand to receive an inheritance." 

I do not wish to speak very long: I do 
not expect my voice will allow me; but 
I want to read an extract showing what 
followed a disobedience of consecration. 
And in this connection I want you to 
distinctly understand that the Lord cer- 
tainly could have preserved the

Saints there had they obeyed His 
will. We will see what followed it for 
disobedience. We will not follow it for 
many years from that time, but will 
take the immediate results of their dis- 
obedience to the law of consecration. 
Then before I get through, I will show 
you something that I think we can 
take satisfaction in. It is not all bad 
that I am going to talk to you this 
morning. Here is an extract taken 
from the history of Joseph Smith in 
the Millennial Star, Vol. 14: 

"Friday, November 1, 1833, I left 
Buffalo, New York, at eight o'clock a. 
m., and arrived at my house in Kirt- 
land on Monday the 4th, ten a. m., and 
found my family well, acording to 
the promise of the Lord in the reve- 
lation of Oct. 12th, for which I felt 
to thank my heavenly Father. 

"Thursday night, the 31st of October, 
gave the Saints in Zion abundant proof 
that no pledge, written or verbal, was 
longer to be regarded; for on that night, 
between forty and fifty persons in num- 
ber, many of whom were armed with 
guns proceeded against a branch of the 
Church west of the Big-Blue, and un- 
roofed, and partly demolished, ten 
dwelling houses; and in the midst of the 
shrieks and screams of women and 
children, whipped and beat in a sav- 
age and brutal manner, several of the 
men; and with their horrid threats 
frightened women and children into 
the wilderness. Such of them 
as could escape, fled for their 
lives; for very few of them had arms, 
neither were they embodied; and they 
were threatened with death if they 
made any resistance: such therefore as 
could not escape by flight, received a 
pelting by rocks, and a beating with 
guns, sticks, etc. 

"On Friday, the 1st of November, wo- 
men and children sallied forth from their 
gloomy retreats, to contemplate with 
heartrending anguish, the ravages of 
a ruthless mob, in the mangled bodies 
of their husbands, and in the destruc- 
tion of their houses, and some of their 
furniture. Houseless, and unprotected 
by the arm of the civil law in Jackson 
County: the dreary month of November 
staring them in the face, and loudly 
proclaiming an inclement season at 
hand: the continual threats of the mob, 
that they would drive out every "Mor- 
mon" from the country; and the in- 
ability of many to remove, because of 
their poverty, caused an anguish of 
heart indescribable. 

"On Friday night, the 1st of November, 
a party of the mob proceeded to attack 
a Branch of the Church at the Prairie, 
about twelve or fourteen miles from the 
village. 

"Two of their number were sent in ad- 
vance, as spies, viz: Robert Johnson, 
and one Harris, armed with two guns 



and three pistols. They were discovered 
by some of the Saints, and without the 
least injury being done to them, said 
Johnson struck Parley P. Pratt with 
the breach of his gun, over the head; 
after which they were taken and de- 
tained 'till morning; which, it was be- 
lieved, prevented a general attack of the 
mob that night. In the morning, they 
were liberated without receiving the 
least injury. 

"The same night (Friday) another 
party in Independence, commenced 
stoning houses, breaking down doors 
and windows, destroying furniture, etc. 
This night the brick part attached to 
the dwelling house of A. S. Gilbert, was 
partly pulled down, and the windows of 
his dwelling broken in with brick-bats 
and rocks, while a gentleman stranger 
lay sick with a fever in his house. 

"The same night, three doors of the 
store of Messrs. Gilbert and Whitney 
were split open; and after midnight, the 
goods lay scattered in the streets, such 
as calicoes, handkerchiefs, shawls, cam- 
brics, etc. An express came from the 
village after midnight to a party of 
their men, who had embodied about half 
a mile from the village for the safety 
of their lives; stating that the mob were 
tearing down houses, and scatter- 
ing the goods of the store in the streets. 
The main body of the mob fled at the 
approach of this company. One Richard 
McCarty was caught in the act of 
throwing rocks and brick-bats into the 
doors, while the goods lay strung 
around him in the streets; and was im- 
mediately taken before Samuel Weston, 
Esq., and a complaint was then made 
to said Weston, and a warrant request- 
ed, that said McCarty might be secured; 
but said Weston refused to do anything 
in the case at that time. Said McCarty 
was then liberated. 

"The same night, some of their houses 
in the village had long poles thrust 
through the shutters and sashes into 
the rooms of defenceless women and 
children, from whence their husbands 
and fathers had been driven by the 
dastardly attacks of the mob, which 
were made by ten, fifteen, or twenty 
men upon a house at a time. 
"Saturday, the second of November, all 
the families of the Saints in the village 
moved about half a mile out. with most 
of their goods, and embodied to the 
number of thirty, for the preservation 
of life and personal effects. This night 
a party from the village met a. party 
from the west of the Blue, and made 
at attack upon a Branch of the Church, 
located at the Blue, about six miles 
from the village. Here they tore the 
roof from one dwelling, and broke 
open another house, found the owner, 
David Bennett, sick in bed, whom they 
beat most inhumanly, swearing they 
would blow out his brains; and dis- 
charged a pistol, the ball of which cut 
a deeD gash across the top of his head. 
In this skirmish, a young man of the 
mob was shot in the thigh; but, by

which party, remains yet to be deter- 
mined. 

The next day, Sunday, Nov. 3rd, four 
of the Church, viz., Joshua Lewis, 
Hiram Page, and two others, were dis- 
patched for Lexington, to see the cir- 
cuit judge, and obtain a peace warrant. 
Two called on Squire Silvers, who re- 
fused to issue one, on account, as he 
has declared, of his fears of the mob. 
This day many of the citizens, profess- 
ing friendship, advised the Saints to 
clear from the country as speedily as 
possible; for the Saturday night affray 
had enraged the whole country, and 
they were determined to come out on 
Monday, and massacre indiscriminate- 
ly; and, in short, it was proverbial 
among the mob, that "Monday would 
be a bloody day." 

"Monday came, and a large party of 
the mob gathered at the Blue, took 
the ferry boat belonging to the Church, 
threatened lives, etc. But they soon 
abandoned the ferry, and went to Wil- 
son's store, about one mile west of the 
Blue. Word had previously gone to a 
Branch of the Church, several miles 
west of the Blue, that the mob were 
destroying property on the east side of 
the Blue, and the sufferers there wanted 
help to preserve their lives and pro- 
perty. Nineteen men volunteered, and 
started for their assistance; but dis- 
covering that fifty or sixty of the mob 
had gathered at said Wilson's, they 
turned back. 
"At this time two small boys passed on 
their way to Wilson's, who gave in- 
formation to the mob, that the "Mor- 
mons" were on the road west of them. 
Between forty and fifty of the mob im- 
mediately started with guns in pursuit; 
after riding two or two and a half miles, 
they discovered them, when the said 
company of nineteen immediately dis- 
persed, and fled in different directions. 
The mob hunted them, turning their 
horses into a corn field belonging to the 
Saints — searching their corn fields and 
houses, threatening women and children 
that they would pull down their houses 
and kill them, if they did not tell where 
the men had fled. 

"Thus they were employed, hunting 
the men, threatening the women, until 
a company of thirty of the Saints from 
the prairie, armed with seventeen guns, 
made their appearance. 

"The former company of nineteen had 
dispersed, and fled, and but one or two of 
them had returned to take part in the 
subsequent battle. On the approach of 
the latter company of thirty men, some 
of the mob cried, "fire, God damn ye, 
fire." Two or three guns were then 
fired by the mob, which were returned 
by the other party without loss of time. 
This company is the same that is re- 
presented by the mob as having gone 
forth in the evening of the battle, bear- 
ing the olive branch of peace. The mob 
retreated early after the first fire, leav- 
ing some of their horses in Whitmer's 
corn field, and two of their number, 
Hugh L. Brazeale and Thomas Linvill, 



dead on the ground. Thus fell H. L. 
Brazeale, one who had been heard to 
say, "with ten fellows, I will wade to 
my knees in blood, but that I will drive 
the Mormons from Jackson County." 
The next morning the corpse of said 
Brazeale was discovered on the battle 
ground with a gun by his side. Sev- 
eral were wounded on both sides, but 
none mortally, except one, Barber, on 
the part of the Saints, who expired the 
next day. This battle was fought about 
sunset, Monday, Nov. the 4th, and the 
same night, runners were dispatched 
in every direction under pretence of 
calling out the militia; spreading as 
they went every rumor calculated to 
alarm and excite the unwary; such as, 
that the "Mormons" had taken Inde- 
pendence, and the Indians had sur- 
rounded it, being colleagued together, 
etc." 

I understand, brethren and sisters, 
that these matters are not very pleasant 
to dwell upon; yet they occurred, and 
the Saints had to meet them. We will 
have to> meet them in the future, if we 
allow ourselves to be placed In the same 
condition of disobedience as were the 
people that colonized Jackson County. 
We cannot expect anything different. 
The Lord is the same today as He was 
yesterday. I present these things to 
you this morning that you may reflect 
upon them, and be more ambitious in 
endeavoring to keep clear of such pos- 
sibilities. They are only a portion of the 
sad results that followed disobedience 
to the law of consecration. The 
Saints pursued a course whereby 
the Lord could not justify himself in 
preserving them upon the land of Zion. 
It was decreed of the Almighty that 
that land should be purchased, as I 
have read to you. I remember one 
time hearing President Hyde (I think it 
was) speaking in regard to our going 
back to Jackson County, and he said 
that inasmuch as they had abused the 
Saints and wrested from them some 
of their possessions, when we 
went back we would follow the same 
course toward them. After he had got 
through, President Young spoke upon 
this, and he said the Latter-day Saints 
never would get possession of that 
land by fighting and destroying life; 
but we would purchase the land, as the 
Lord had commanded in the first place. 
And I will tell you that that land never 
will be purchased, except it is purchas- 
ed by the tithing of the Latter-day 
Saints and their consecrations; never 
worlds without end. But the Latter-

day Saints never will be in that condi- 
tion of disobedience as were the people 
that colonized Jackson County. A re- 
formation has taken place during the 
last few months that is perfectly mar- 
velous. I am amazed at what has been 
the result of our teachings to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints upon the principle of 
tithing. I will read this law of tithing 
as it is given in Section 119 of the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants and I ask 
you brethren to read it when you get 
home; not only once, but all the time 
until you understand it thoroughly and 
distinctly, though it is so simple and 
plain that one would imagine that read- 
ing it once would be sufficient. 

"Revelation given through Joseph, 
the Prophet, at Far Wesf Missouri, 
July 8th, 1838, in answer to the question, 
O Lord, show unto thy servants how 
much thou requirest of the properties 
of the people for a tithing?" 

That is a plain request, and the an- 
swer is equally as plain. 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord. I require 
all their surplus property to be put into 
the hands of the bishop of my church 
of Zion." 

T want to say a word in reference 
to this surplus property. The Pro- 
phet Joseph explained how it should be 
given. When a person wished to con- 
secrate property, the Bishop and the 
person desiring to consecrate should 
determine what was right in the mat- 
ter, and if they could not agree, it 
should be left to twelve High Priests 
to decide, and the Bishop should not 
be one of the number. 

"For the building of mine house, and 
for the laying of the foundation of Zion, 
and for the Priesthood and for the 
debts of the Presidency of my church." 

This Church could not go on unless 
there was revenue, and this revenue 
God has provided for. Our temples, in 
which we receive the highest blessings 
ever conferred on mortal man, are 
built through revenue. We never could 
send the two thousand Elders out into 
the world to preach the Gospel, as we 
are now doing, unless there was revenue 
to do it. It costs tens of thousands of 
dollars, running into the hundreds of 
thousands, to send our Elders out to the 
world year after year. Then there are 
a thousand other things constantly oc- 
curring for which means are required. 
$40,000 or $50,000 is required yearly to 
support the poor. 



"And this shall be the beginning of 
the tithing of my people. 

'And after that, those who had thus 
been tithed, shall pay one tenth of all 
their interest annually.'" 

This will be explained to you here- 
after, although it is perhaps a little 
strange that there should be any neces- 
sity of explaining it. It is like the 
school boy, however, when he com- 
mences to learn the alphabet. The 
letter A is pointed out to him by the 
teacher, and tells him what it is and 
asks him to please remember it. The 
next letter, B, is pointed out, and 
the boy is asked to remember that. The 
teacher then returns to A. What letter 
is that? The boy has forgotten and it 
has to be repeated by the teacher. 
Will you please remember it now? The 
boy says, "O yes, I'll remember it." He 
feels sure that he can remember it now. 
But when the teacher returns to the let- 
ter once more, the boy has forgotten 
it again. So they go through the alpha- 
bet, having to repeat each letter over 
and over again. It is the same with the 
Latter-day Saints. We have to talk 
to them, and keep talking to them. 
Well, that is our business, so we need 
not worry about it. The Lord contin- 
ues: 

"And this shall be a standing law 
unto them for ever, for my Holy Priest- 
hood, saith the Lord." 

That law is just as important and sac- 
red today as when it first came from 
the Lord. 

"Verily I say unto you, it shall come 
to pass that all those who gather unto 
the land of Zion shall be tithed of their 
surplus properties, and shall observe 
this law, or they shall not be found 
worthy to abide among you." 

No more than the people in Jackson 
were found worthy to remain 
in Jackson County. Tou will be shown 
probably hereafter that their names 
shall not be recorded in the book of the 
law of the Lord, neither the names of 
their fathers nor the names of their 
children. If we had time and Bishop 
Preston could talk to you about this, 
he would show you that the name of 
every man, woman and child who pays 
tithing is recorded and none others. 

"And I say unto you, if my people 
observe not this law to keep it holy. — " 

No man can keep this law holy unless 
he pay a conscientious tithing. 



GENER AL C ONFERENCE. 



"If mv people observe not this law, 
to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify 
the land of Zion unto me. that my stat- 
utes and judgments may be kept there- 
on, that it may be most holy, behold, 
verily I say unto you, it shall not be a 
land of Zion unto you. And this shall 
be an ensample unto all the Stakes of 
Zion." 

If some of the Latter-day Saints had 
not paid tithing our four Temples here 
never would have been erected, and the 
judgments and statutes of God pertain- 
ing unto exaltation and glory never 
could have been kept. The first prin- 
ciple of action to the Latter-day Saints 
is to sanctify the land by keeping this 
law of tithing and placing themselves 
in a position where they can receive the 
ordinances that pertain unto exaltation 
and glory of our dead. 

Now we will turn to the more pleas- 
ing part of the subject, and see what 
the Latter-day Saints have been doing 
since this matter was brought to their 
attention in St. George. In the month 
of May the Lord manifested to me most 
clearly that it was my business and the 
business of the Elders of Israel to go 
speedily and teach this principle to the 
Latter-day Saints, because there had 
been woeful neglect of this law, and 
the Latter-day Saints should be shown 
the necessity of observing this law most 
faithfully, or else the results would not 
be agreeable to say the least. We have 
been talking about this since the latter 
part of May, and it has been a matter 
of deep consideration and thought as to 
how much talk would affect the Latter- 
day Saints. In looking over the books 
we found that a great many of the 
Latter-day Saints had not paid one 
cent of tithing. I was perfectly aston- 
ished, for I had no idea that there 
had been such neglect. But the Saints 
have been wonderfully awakened, and 
it is marvelous what they have done 
in the past few months. I am now go- 
ing to read to you in regard to the re- 
sult of our talking to the Saints. We 
have the greatest pleasure and satis- 
faction in knowing what the Latter- 
day Saints are doing now in comparison 
with what they have done for many 
years past:

same four months this year, 1899, was 
$164,900, making an increase of $95,800 
for the four months. In October, 1898, 
$18,000 was paid, and during the six 
days that are now past of this month 
$22,000 has been paid. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints. I 
want to have this principle so fixed 
upon our hearts that we shall never 
forget it. As I have said more than 
once, I know that the Lord will forgive 
the Latter-day Saints for their past 
negligence in paying tithing, if they 
will now repent and pay a conscientious 
tithing from this time on. But it would 
be woeful to think of the results if the 
Latter-day Saints had failed to listen to 
the voice of the servants of the Lord. 
It is God's truth that the time has now 
come when He will not look favorably 
upon our negligence of this principle. I 
plead with you in the name of the Lord, 
and I pray that every man, woman 
and child who has means shall pay one- 
tenth of their income as a tithing. I 
beseech you to do this for the time has 
now come when the Lord is prepared to 
bestow upon us the choicest blessings. 
Our enemies are upon our path, and will 
if possible make us trouble. If we are 
unfaithful in this matter the same re- 
sults will follow us as followed the peo- 
ple in Jackson County. It is not our 
business to fight our enemies. There is 
no man or woman on the face of the 
earth, but is our brother or our sister. 
They are the children of God and we 
are here to bear and forbear with them 
in their interest and for the glory of 
God. It is not our business to destroy 
life. It is not our business to make 
war upon our enemies. They should let 
us alone. I would not say that I could 
govern and control by passions if a man 
Mere to try to take my life. That is 
another thing altogether. But it Is not 
our business to fight them. They are 
our brethren and sisters and God hav« 



ELDER JOHN HEhRY SMI1 H

mercy upon them. That should be our 
prayer. There are thousands of people 
that are fighting against us who would, 
if they knew what we know, lay down 
their weapons and suppress the spirit 
to contend against us. The time will 
come when they will know it. It will 
not be in our day, but it will be in 
somebody's day here on the earth, or on 
some other earth. It is our business to 
do what the Lord requires of us, and 
He will protect us. It is very easy for 
the Lord to protect us and to overrule 
our enemies' intentions that they may 
not interfere with our interests. God 
bless you. Let us observe the law of 
God. Do not forget what the Lord re- 
quires of us today. Be faithful today, 
and when tomorrow comes we will be 
the better prepared to be faithful then. 
So let us continue day after day, and 
bye and bye we will be relieved of this 
body of sin and corruption, sorrow, and 
grief, and we will have another body, 
exalted and glorified, and we will dwell 
in the presence of God. We will be there 
together and talk with one another as 
we are doing today. God bless you. 
Amen.

My brethren and sisters, with you I 
believe that our services this morning 
should be most deeply impressed upon 
every mind, and rather than to speak 
myself I certainly would much prefer 
to remain in thought upon the sug- 
gestions couched in the discourse of 
President Snow, bearing upon the well- 
being of the Saints in the early days 
of this Church and the trying experi- 
ences through which they were com- 
pelled to go. In considering the cir- 
cumstances surrounding our brothers 
and sisters in that day and those which 
surround us today, I feel that I would 
like to fix an idea in my own mind 
which would guard me, in the perform- 
ance of my part in connection with 
the work of God, from the possibility 
of that severe experience through 
which the Saints passed during that 
time. I feel not only so with regard 
to myself, but I would like to see it 



possible to eliminate from the experi- 
ences of my brothers and sisters such 
trials. I believe thoroughly that if we 
can apply to our lives each doctrine of 
the Gospel, and earnestly seek to im- 
press upon the circles in which we 
move, the necessity of a strict obedi- 
ence to each ordinance established in 
the Lord's House, the promise that has 
been given us will be fully realized. 
Not that I anticipate for a moment 
that the victory is gained and that the 
enemy of all righteousness will be 
speedily and thoroughly subdued. Our 
Father has made the promise to the 
Latter-day Saints that He would soften 
the hearts of their enemies from time 
to time until they gain strength. He 
has fulfilled this promise in the years 
that are past and gone. Men whose 
hearts seemed embittered, to an extent 
that was alarming, against the work 
of the Lord, have modified their feelings 
and their actions in fulfillment of this 
promise of our Father. I believe that 
in future times like conditions will 
arise, until in the providence of God 
His people shall be so fully established 
in the understanding of the truth and 
in power in the world that they will 
stand firm and readily obey every re- 
quirement of the Gospel, and in that 
obedience mankind will prove the 
generosity of the work of God in its 
dealings with the children of men. In- 
stead of their standing in dread of it 
and the development of its power, they 
will recognize that its growth means 
an advance in the interests of morality 
and honesty, and a spread of that 
sentiment which leads to the protec- 
tion and preservation of the liberties 
of the children of men. This is its mis- 
sion. The consciences of men through- 
out the world are to be guarded and 
protected by it. Under its guardian 
care men shall be able to exercise their 
right of conscience untrammeled and 
fulfill their mission on the earth in the 
way in which they deem best, without, 
however, interfering with or trampling 
upon the right of their fellowmen. 

I have in my mind several subjects 
upon which I would like to speak 
briefly. I do not desire, however, to 
take your minds away from the utter- 
ances of our President this morning, 
who has brought before us the history 
of the past and the failures that have 
arisen from time to time, and given 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to us anew the promises of God, inas- 
much as we will do our Father's bid- 
ding and keep His commandments. If 
we will do this God will right our bat- 
tles; we shall not be compelled to shed 
blood, but, by the means prescribed 
by the Master, we shall establish His 
Latter-day Zion upon the basis of the 
legitimate possession of the soil and in 
the improvements that shall be made 
thereon, the result of that industry and 
determination which successfully builds 
empires and ennobles the people who 
live within those empires. 

One subject upon which I desire to 
speak to you for a short period of time 
is the question of the finishing of the 
Brigham Young monument. About one- 
half of that which we contracted to 
pay through our committee has been 
paid for the construction of that monu- 
ment. The part that has been paid 
for, according to the claim of the artist, 
is the work of modelling, and not the 
work of casting the statue of President 
Young and the other figures that are 
to adorn the monument. We would 
have you remember that the monu- 
ment is only about half completed at 
the present time. There are other 
figures to be placed upon it. I believe 
that the brethren and sisters have not 
recognized their responsibility in con- 
nection with this matter as fully as 
they should. Many have done their full 
duty in connection with it. On the 
other hand, hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of the people have not given 
that aid which they should do towards 
the completion of that structure. I 
take the view that it was the will of 
the Presidency of the Church that that 
work should be done, or it would not 
have been attempted. It has proceed- 
ed thus far. It now needs completion. 
The gentleman who did the work has 
been extremely modest in his demands 
so far, but now he begins to feel that 
he should have some consideration for 
the work done. I believe that he should. 
The statue was placed in position really 
without his consent, as he believed that 
it would result in a stoppage upon the 
part of the people, contributing the 
necessary funds. But the committee 
felt that the people within our borders 
who admire the character of the sturdy 
men who laid the foundation of these 
western commonwealths, would readily 
respond to the obligations that at- 



tached to the construction of that 
monument. I fully believe myself that 
such will be the case when the people 
shall fully understand the situation. I 
trust, my brothers and sisters, that we 
will show the same loyalty, devotion 
and earnestness in connection with this 
work that has characterized some of 
the men, who in their lives have fought 
President Young's work in this inter- 
mountain region, but who recognize the 
worth of his great character and the 
sturdy strength and undying will of the 
noble band who, in connection with 
him, laid the foundation of these com- 
monwealths and put us in the exalted 
station that we occupy today in the 
world's history, especially in the his- 
tory of the western part of the United 
States. There remains unpaid about 
one-half of the means that was origin- 
ally deemed necessary to complete that 
work. It has been distributed among 
the Stakes, and to the credit of a few 
Stakes, let it be said they have ful- 
filled their full part in regard to this 
matter. Such has been the case with 
Maricopa Stake, Snowflake Stake, and 
Tooele Stake; and some of the other 
Stakes have nearly paid the proportion 
that was allotted to them. I realize 
that there exists in the minds of quite 
a number of people a feeling that the 
scriptures forbid the construction of 
monuments, from the fact that it is 
said somewhere in the Bible that we 
should not make any graven images to 
worship them. Because of this, preju- 
dice has been aroused in the minds of 
some people, and has without doubt 
restrained a few from the fulfillment of 
their part in connection with this work. 
It seems to me that this is not pro- 
per on the part of any one. There is 
not one of us, I presume, that would 
for a moment, as we pass the struc- 
ture upon which stands the statue of 
President Young, bow our heads in any 
sense to worship that image, which 
represents this heroic character of the 
past. But, when reading the names 
that are inscribed upon that stone, each 
one should recognize the efforts made 
by that noble band, the sufferings they 
endured and their determination to give 
to their people and the down-trodden 
of every section of the world that might 
desire it, the opportunities and privi- 
leges presented in the development of 
this western country, and acknowledge

that they fulfilled their mission in honor 
and with credit to the cause which 
they represented. I am one of those 
who believe that nations can do no 
more good in developing the patriotism 
of their sons and daughters than in 
the recording of the heroic deeds of 
valor in war, in statesmanship, in the 
laying of the foundations of common- 
wealths, and in the development of the 
temporal and spiritual interests of the 
people. As I pass among the cities of 
the world, I note with pride the evi- 
dences of the worth in which scholars 
have been held by the people among 
whom they have lived, or by the peo- 
ple who, after their death have dis- 
covered their merits in the things they 
have written, in the laws they have 
sought to enact and in the spirit that 
has been impressed upon the hearts of 
people who have become imbued with 
, their thoughts and actions. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints desire to have stamped 
upon the souls of their sons and 
daughters the same heroic aspirations, 
the same undying devotion to the prin- 
ciples of justice, mercy and true re- 
ligion that characterized that band of 
men who laid the foundations of our 
commonwealth and opened the door for 
the successes that have come to the 
homes of the people of Utah, of Idaho, 
of Wyoming, of Colorado, of Arizona, 
of Nevada, California, of Oregon and 
of Washington. They laid the founda- 
tion of the village system, which put 
us in possession of the enjoyment of 
privileges that few other sections of 
the world have. Other peoples have 
separated the city from the country, 
but with us- it is a combination of the 
city and country. I trust that no man 
will raise his voice against the com- 
pletion of that work, and fail in any 
sense to perform his whole part in See- 
ing that the men who did this work 
shall be held in memory, and that our 
sons and daughters, as they look upon 
the one who acted the chief part in 
connection with the development of this 
work, shall see in that figure and form 
that which is emblematic of the hero, 
who exhibited the powers of the states- 
man, the leader, the guide, the pioneer, 
and who did all upon the basis of his 
love for God and in harmony with His 
divine law. Wherever we may go in 
the world and study the conditions of 



civilization, we shall find written the 
deeds of their heroic and capable sons. 
While I am not one of those who are 
given to man-worship, nor do I have 
any inclination to bow down before any 
being, except my God, I recognize the 
inspiration of the heroic deeds done in 
the interest of country, in the interest 
of religion, in the interest of science, 
in the interest of civil government in 
its best forms, and in the extension of 
the principles of liberty and the open- 
ing of the doors by which the unfortun- 
ate can enjoy privileges that under 
other conditions would be denied them. 
The people of Utah are among the best 
and brightest of the world. Her edu- 
cational system came from the experi- 
ence of men schooled in adversity, de- 
veloped and prepared for the mission 
they had to perform under the direc- 
tion of Almighty God, and their names 
will be written on high by that Master 
whom they serve. We, their sons and 
daughters, and they who have received 
the benefits of their ministrations and 
labors, can do no more kindly or 
thoughtful act than to present to our 
children, in the form of a monument 
such as this, the evidence of the es- 
teem in which they were held and the 
work they accomplished for the inter- 
est and wellbeing of the human race. 
I rejoice when I see the names of the 
Father of our country and that grand 
body of men who developed the inter- 
ests of our nation lauded and held in 
high esteem. I rejoice when I see the na- 
tion respect and honor those who have 
maintained the integrity and honor of 
the nation in other lands, and whose 
heroic deeds have been for the blessing 
and not for the hurt of their fellows. 
I trust that the same spirit and feeling 
shall guide the Latter-day Saints in 
this mountain region, in obeying the 
law of God, loving the principles of 
righteousness, determined to be just 
and generous to their fellowmen, and 
remembering in every walk of life the 
rights and privileges that are theirs 
in common with their fellows, without 
fear of the frowns or of the favors of 
any. It is our right to believe in God; 
it is our right to honor Brigham Young 
and the pioneers who laid the founda- 
tions of this commonwealth. It is our 
right to fulfill the obligations and du- 
ties that rest upon us as men, in honor

before our maker. It Is our duty to 
obey the laws of our country, and fol- 
low the rules of public policy that gov- 
ern the best interests and wellbeing of 
the nation in which we live. It is our 
duty to be just, to be generous, to be 
upright and consistent in all our ways. 
Perhaps this is enough from me upon 
this question. I believe you will sus- 
tain your Presidents of Stakes and 
Bishops by seeing to it that the district 
in which you reside fulfills its part, 
and that there should be no question in 
the minds of any man or woman but 
that they have done their part in seek- 
ing to sustain the good names of the 
heroic band whose hearts were in ac- 
cord with the Spirit of God and whose 
guiding and directing wish was the 
betterment of the human race and the 
salvation of the Latter-day Saints. 

There is another little item upon 
which I wish to speak to you for a 
brief time, and that is upon the ques- 
tion of the amusements of the Latter- 
day Saints. I am one of those who be- 
lieve that legitimate and proper amuse- 
ment should always be provided for the 
young, for the middle-aged and for the 
aged among the Saints. I endorse the 
action with all my heart of the Prophet 
Joseph, in permitting to be utilized the 
mimic stage as a means of education 
among the people. I endorse with all 
my heart the continued effort of Presi- 
dent Brigham Young and his associ- 
ates in seeking to put within the reach 
of all classes legitimate and proper 
amusements, and to have the play 
house under proper control. I rejoice 
in the establishment of proper places 
where the young and the aged can min- 
gle together and the former be under 
the restraining influence of the more 
mature. But I see that there is a ten- 
dency in relation to amusements that 
forbodes evil to the moral wellbeing of 
our community, and it is based, in my 
judgment, upon the action of the older 
persons in our communities withdraw- 
ing themselves from association with 
the young. This should not be. The 
young should have their amusements 
under the eye of the more mature. 
And their thoughtful judgment should 
be exercised to restrain them from the 
perpetration of evil. 

I remember that among the very lat- 
est days of the life of President Young 



he was found with us in the Social 
Hall. When I was a boy, he was found 
with us in the Fourteenth Ward hall, 
in the Thirteenth Ward hall, and in 
the various halls of the city, as much 
as it was possible for him to be. But 
I discover as I mingle with the young 
and enter their places of amusement, 
a tendency in the direction of neglect 
in this respect. This is working an in- 
jury that many of us will regret later 
in life, if we do not guard more care- 
fully the wellbeing of our sons and 
daughters until they shall reach that 
period of life when they shall more 
wisely consider and more fully weigh 
the possibilities of temptation and evil 
that lie in the way of the thoughtless 
and imprudent. I trust that the spirit 
to guard and direct our sons and 
daughters in wisdom and prudence will 
characterize the lives of fathers and 
mothers and the presiding authorities . 
in the Church, always striving to main- 
tain that degree of decorum and that 
consistency and prudence that should 
govern the lives of those who are build- 
ing not alone for the present, but also 
for the future, that in time to come 
their children may stand accepted in 
the presence of God. 

I bear my testimony to the truth of 
the law of God directing the collection 
of means for establishing His work. 
Possibly no man has been so extreme in 
his judgment upon this matter as my- 
self, under some circumstances; for in 
one of the Stakes of Zion some months 
ago, I presumed to say to the authori- 
ties of that Stake that if there was an 
officer there who was not prepared to 
accept the law of tithing, so far as I 
was concerned as a representative of 
the Presidency of this Church, I was 
theije to accept his resignation. I be- 
lieve upon this question that if there 
are presiding authorities in the Church 
of Christ who will not obey that law 
and fulfill its obligations, their place is 
among the ranks, where they may be 
taught and instructed by some one wil- 
ling to fulfill the law — a law which 
opens the doorway to the companion- 
ship of the just and the good in time to 
come. 

I bear my witness to the truth of this 
work, to the truth of every principle 
God has revealed, and to the truth of 
that law which He has established by 



ELDER FRANCIS M LYMAN

which the borders of Zion are to be 
lengthened, her cords strengthened, her 
temples completed, and her Presiding 
authorities to have the means to fulfill 
the mission and responsibility placed 
upon them by the Divine One. Amen.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
2 p. m. 

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins: 

"Glorious things are sung of Zion, 
Enoch's city seen of old, 

Where the righteous, being perfect, 
Walked with God in streets of gold." 

Prayer by Elder Louis A. Kelsch. 
Singing by the choir: 

"Glory to God on high; 
Let heaven and earth reply, 
Praise ye His name." 

ELDER P. M. LYMAN. 

Nature of the Law of Tithing— Its Requiiememts 
have been Widely Ignored— Effects of Obedi- 
ence to It — Forgiveness comes Through Re- 
pentance—Offerings of the Saints — The Obli- 
gation of Obedience — That which is Temporal 
and Spiritual Inseparable— How Eternal In- 
heritances are Obtained. 

My brethren and sisters: I pray that 
the Spirit of the Lord may be with us 
this afternoon, as it has been so abund- 
antly with our brethren, and that we 
may have the liberty of that Spirit in 
speaking and in listening, and profit by 
what the Lord may please to give us. 
Time is very precious, and this is a 
very large congregation, and without 
the help of the Lord, it is not possible 
for an Elder to edify this intelligent 
audience. 

We have been listening to the in- 
struction of President Snow and his 
brethren in the various Stakes of Zion, 
particularly upon the law of tithing, 
in such a way, possibly, as it has 
not been brought before the people in 
the past. There is a time for all things, 
and it appears as though the time has 
come when the Latter-day Saints- 
should give particular attention to this 
important law. The condition of the 
people individually, as well as the con- 
dition of the Church, has made it neces- 
sary for the Lord to announce through 



His servants that we must put our- 
selves right with regard to this prin- 
ciple. Like all the other principles of 
the Gospel, it is vital and very im- 
portant, and it is not alone that the 
foundations of Zion may be laid and 
the obligations of the Church be met, 
as they needed to be met in 1838, when 
the Lord was besought by the Prophet 
Joseph to know how much was neces- 
sary of the property of the people for a 
tithing. It is not an unusual thing for 
the Prophet to approach the Lord in 
times of necessity and when it appears 
plain to the mind of the Prophet that 
something needs to be done. We could 
not tell without the inspiration of the 
Lord what resources there were for the 
Church to rely upon, but how simple 
and Dlain it is when the Lord an- 
nounces that if Israel will bring in all 
their tithes and offerings, that there 
may be meat in the storehouse of the 
Lord, He will open the windows of 
Heaven and pour out a blessing that 
we shall hardly be able to contain. 
The necessities of the people today in 
these valleys, the things that we are 
suffering, the early frosts that have 
destroyed quite a percentage of the 
crops of the people in the higher val- 
leys, the loss in the fruit crop, all ad- 
monish us that we need a blessing from 
the Lord. 

It has been discovered, as the records 
of the Church abundantly show, that 
quite a percentage of the Latter-day 
Saints have entirely ignored this law 
of tithing. Twenty-five per cent have 
neglected it altogether. What right 
have we in the Church if we are not 
willing to obey the laws of the Church? 
As well might we think of being mem- 
bers in good standing and fellowship, 
if we had failed to receive baptism of 
the water and of the Spirit, or if we 
refused to gather together or to preach 
the Gospel. Without the law of tithing, 
as we heard from the President this 
morning, these temples could not have 
been built. What has been done to- 
wards the laying of the foundations of 
Zion could not have been accomplished 
without the revenue law of the Church. 
And it is a most reasonable law. I 
believe that I have discovered, as well 
as my brethren, why the Lord has de- 
termined that one-tenth of our interest 
annually should be required for a tith- 



34

ing. I understand it to be for the rea- 
son that that amount is just exactly 
what is necessary to accomplish the 
purposes of the Lord. Less than that 
is insufficient. Tithing- has been known 
among the people of Israel from the 
early ages. It has been proven not only 
among the people that have occupied 
this earth, but among people who have 
occupied other earths than this. It is 
a law that has been demonstrated in 
the experience of the children of God 
through all past ages, and it is under- 
stood that one-tenth is just the amount 
necessary to meet the requirements of 
the Lord. How much allowance the 
Lord has made, in His reckoning, for 
those who, being without faith, will be 
negligent and will not have the 
strength and power of character to en- 
dure, I am not able to say. But He 
has no doubt established it as the very 
amount that is absolutely necessary for 
the purposes of the Lord. It is also 
just exactly the amount that is neces- 
sary to try the souls of the children of 
men and to prove them. Men who can 
observe that law and live it properly 
will be prepared to graduate unto a 
higher plane, which they must do be- 
fore the redemption of Zion. Before we 
enter upon the law of consecration, 
which is the celestial law of God in 
finance, it is necessary that we should 
take the training that we are now hav- 
ing under the law of tithing. 

Tou may be certain, my brethren and 
sisters, that any person who is not 
able to observe this law faithfully and 
well will never, worlds without end, 
be able to observe the law of consecra- 
tion. The law of tithing is a stepping 
stone, and it is a law that will abide 
forever, because a great majority pos- 
sibly of the children of God will not be 
able to reach the higher law. 

Since President Snow has been talk- 
ing so plainly upon this subject, there 
have been a class of people who have 
undertaken to take advantage of his 
promise to the Latter-day Saints in 
regard to this law, that if for the fu- 
ture they would observe this law faith- 
fully the past should be forgiven. 
There have been men guilty of breaches 
of the laws of morality and honesty 
who have claimed that if they now pay 
their tithing all their sins will be for- 



given them. President Snow never an- 
nounced any such doctrine as that. He 
could not announce such a doctrine as 
that. But the Lord is perfectly able to 
say to us that if we will observe this 
law of finance, which we have been 
under now for over sixty years, for 
the future and keep this commandment 
our past negligence of the law of tith- 
ing will be forgiven. He is competent 
also to say that if we will repent of our 
sins and serve God with all our hearts 
for the future, our sins will be for- 
given us; but not otherwise. The for- 
giveness of sins is predicated upon 
faith in God, repentance and reforma- 
tion and baptism. Sins are not forgiven 
through the payment of tithing, nor 
through the partaking of the sacra- 
ment, nor observing the Word of Wis- 
dom, or prayer. There are blessings at- 
tached to each of these important re- 
quirements of the Gospel; but if a man 
would have his sins forgiven, and be al- 
lowed to enter into the Church, he must 
have faith in God, and in His Son Jesus 
Christ and in the Holy Ghost, he must 
repent of all his sins, turn unto the 
Lord with full purpose of heart and sin 
no more. Then God will forgive him 
and redeem him from his sins; but not 
by paying tithing. By the payment of 
tithing the foundations of Zion are laid, 
and up to the present time our tithing 
has been paid to accomplish what we 
now see done in a temporal way. The 
offerings also have been generous 
enough to perform a great work, for 
we have paid offerings as well as tith- 
ing. We have made offerings of our 
time, in preaching the Gospel to the 
world without purse or scrip. We have 
made offerings for the building of tem- 
ples, for the erection of meeting houses 
and for other public works that have 
been accomplished among the Latter- 
day Saints. By our offerings the poor 
have been reasonably cared for, and if 
our offerings were as generous as they 
ought to be no poor person among the 
Latter-day Saints would ever have to 
cry for relief without receiving it freely. 
But we want our names recorded in the 
Lamb's Book of Life, and it is not done 
by the observance of a*— one principle 
alone, but to every principle there are 
special blessings promised. There are, 
in the records of the Church today, the 



ELDER FRAIS/CIS M. LYMAN 



names of every man, woman and child 
who has given of their means for tith- 
ing. Those records can be scanned and 
our faith and works can be understood 
by the Presidency of the Church. And 
we ought to be known; we want to be 
known. We want to be recognized, not 
alone as having a name among the peo- 
ple, but as being faithful, devoted, hum- 
ble and obedient. 

Obedience is the first law of God. It is 
most important that we should be 
obedient to the word and will of the 
Lord. It was that which entitled the 
Son of God to be anointed above His 
brethren; for He was in all things most 
perfect and obedient. He put not forth 
His own will, but He submitted to the 
will of the Father in all things, even 
to the laying down of His life, in order 
that He might be indeed the Son of God, 
the Savior of the world. He has earned 
that important position, and through 
the shedding of His blood and His 
atonement we are redeemed. By hu- 
mility and faith and repentance we ob- 
tain the forgiveness of our sins, and 
are entitled to have our names upon the 
records of the Church as members of 
the Church. But that fact does not 
demonstrate particularly any very im- 
portant work that we have accomplish- 
ed in sustaining the work of the Lord. 
By it we are entitled to enter in, but 
after we have been recorded members 
of the Church we must then work out 
our salvation and earn eternal life, for 
it is not obtained without earning it. 

The Lord is not going to give us every- 
thing without our doing something. He 
requires of us a broken heart, a con- 
trite spirit, an obedience to the mind 
and will of the ±-fOrd. And this is rea- 
sonable. How generous the Lord is to 
us when He declares through His pro- 
phet, "if from this time forth you will 
do my will with regard to the law of 
tithing, the past shall be blotted out." 
It is not only generous, but it is rea- 
sonable and philosophical. The object 
of the Lord is the salvation of the peo- 
ple, and if He should come out with a 
revelation today, saying that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints must square up all their 
back tithing, do you think they could 
do it? No. It could not be done, any 
more than a man could gather up the 
sins he has committed and blot them 



out. They are committed, and we can- 
not change the fact that they are com 
mitted. We may be forgiven, we may 
be redeemed, they may be finally blot- 
ted out, if our repentance is genuine and 
we do not return to our sins again; 
but it is done through the atoning blood 
of the Lord Jesus. No man can for- 
give his own sins, no man can redeem 
himself from his sins. Neither can any 
man pay his back tithing, if he has 
been a member of this Church forty 
or fifty years and been paying only part 
of his tithing all that time, and pos- 
sibly paying none at all. The Lord 
would not require such a thing, be- 
cause He knows the Latter-day Saints 
could not do it. Why, it is all they can 
do to pay their tithing today. Suffi- 
cient for the day is the tithing thereof; 
sufficient for the day are the offerings 
thereof; sufficient for the day are the 
labors thereof; sufficient for the day is 
the repentance and reformation re 
quired of men. They cannot do two 
days in one. Yesterday has gone for 
ever. We cannot recall it, any more 
than we can bring to us tomorrow; to- 
morrow will always be ahead of us. 
Today is the day of salvation, and the 
day in which all our labors must bt- 
performed. Therefore we want to re- 
member that He hath forgiven the 
past, thank the Lord. But do not let 
you or I regret if we have been among 
that number who have paid their tith- 
ing reasonably well, and feel sorry that 
we did not keep our tithing back so 
that we could be forgiven. For there 
is an advantage, there is a blessing and 
an enlargement of the soul that comes to 
the man who obeys the word and will 
of the Lord. It is better that we have 
done God's will than that we should 
have need to be forgiven for neglect- 
ing it. It is better not to have been a 
sinner. It is better that our sins 
should be very light, and not of a seri- 
ous nature than that they should be 
deadly sins. It is better that we should 
live without sin, and be like the Son 
of God. It is not necessary that we 
should be sinners. God has designed 
that we should not be sinners, but that 
we should live lives of purity and 
righteousness and walk in obedience to 
His will, as the Savior did. The Lord 
desires, just as you desire, every 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



one of your children to be obedient, 
honest and pure. You do not want 
them defiled and dishonest, in order 
that you may forgive them. Therefore 
I say to my brethren and sisters who 
have paid their tithing and have little 
or nothing to be forgiven for in that 
respect, thank the Lord, and only wish 
that there was nothing that you had 
need to be forgiven for, and that you 
had done the will of the Lord most per- 
fectly. 

A great many of the Latter-day 
Saints have done very well. Thank the 
Lord for what has been accomplished 
since last May; thank the Lord that 
the people have listened, and that you 
have had testimonies in your hearts, 
as well as President Snow. You are 
entitled to know for yourselves. Every 
one of these Apostles knows that Presi- 
dent Snow's testimony is from the Lord, 
for He has told us. We comprehend It 
most thoroughly; so does every Latter- 
day Saint who has done the will of the 
Lord. Every Latter-day Saint who has 
now detided and determined to do the 
will of the Lord also knows it. Those 
who do the will of the Lord in the fu- 
ture shall also know that God has 
spoken through President Snow. It is 
his particular mission and ministry to 
set right the Latter-day Saints in re- 
gard to this particular law — not to neg- 
lect any other and not to say that 
men's sins will be forgiven them if 
they pay their tithing. That is a mis- 
take, and only transgressors have con- 
cluded that Bishops and the authorities 
of the Church have no right to handle 
them now for their transgressions, be- 
cause President Snow has said that 
the past should be forgiven. He has 
only said that the past should be for- 
given, so far as the payment of tith- 
ing was concerned. Thank the Lord 
that we may be forgiven for that. 

Do- you not remember when the Salt 
Lake Temple was dedicated in 1893, how 
everybody was allowed to go in there, 
transgressors and' all, because their 
names were upon the record and they 
had not been dealt with? The Prophet 
Wilford "Woodruff announced then that 
the sins of the Latter-day Saints were 
forgiven them; but who are Latter- 
day Saints? Who are the men and wo- 
men to whom President Woodruff re- 
ferred? Any man who had not re- 



pented? No. Any man who had not 
made satisfaction? No. He was only 
announcing that the work you and I 
are engaged in is genuine, and that in 
our repentance and reformation there 
was vitality and virtue, and that we 
were forgiven so far as we had com- 
plied with these laws. He never meant 
that a man who was an adulterer, or 
horse thief, was to be forgiven because 
he went into that Temple, without hav- 
ing made satisfaction or having re- 
pented. President Woodruff could not 
say that; no ProDhet could say it. 
The Father could not say it, only upon 
the principles of repentance, reforma- 
tion and righteousness — not a repent- 
ance for a little season, but to obtain 
forgiveness for our sins we must sin no 
more. We must not turn like the dog 
to his vomit or the sow to her wallow- 
ing in the mire, but we must reform 
and then labor as the Lord directs, 
then He will gladly forgive us, just as 
He will now cancel our obligations in 
regard to tithing, if for the future we 
will do the will of the Lord. 

Let our names be recorded upon the 
book of the law of the Lord, where 
they can be seen and known, and let 
the conscience of every man, woman 
and child be clear and free. Why, 
when we look over the records now, we 
find men in high positions in the 
Church who have been very careless 
and censurable in regard to the law of 
tithing. No doubt many have entered 
into the Temples of the Lord who have 
never done a single thing to help erect 
or maintain them. We want to repent 
of these things. We need not be afraid 
in regard to the Church; we have no 
need to be disturbed or worried in re- 
gard to the obligations of the Church. 
What should disturb us is our individ- 
ual obligations to the Lord and to one 
another. Deal honestly and squarely 
with the Lord, and you will very readi- 
ly be able to deal honestly and squarely 
with your brethren. Let us meet our 
obligations to the Lord, for to Him we 
owe life and everything we possess. He 
has entrusted us with it as stewards, 
and we want to make good our stew- 
ardship. The talents that He has en- 
trusted us with let us turn them ovei 
and double them. Do not bury them, 
nor hide them up, but invest them so 
that they will increase. The Lord re- 



ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN 



37 



quires this of us. The man who pays 
his tithing by the thousands or by the 
hundreds is not the only one that is 
acceptable to the Lord. The one who 
pays his fives, his tens, or his fifties — 
the tithing on whatever the Lord blesses 
him with — is acceptable to the Lord al- 
so. The Lord does not expect a man 
with one talent to turn over ten. If 
he returned two he is doing wonder- 
fully well. He does not expect a man 
with two talents to turn over ten, but 
four. He expects men to employ their 
talents and to make good use of them. 
He does not look with favor upon a 
slothful servant, because it is wicked 
to be slothful and idle. We want to 
be Industrious and persevering and 
see how much we can do in this life 
with the talents that God has intrust- 
ed us with; then we will be acceptable 
to Him. The widow's mite, thank the 
Lord, is as large as the millionaire's 
great amount of means that he may 
turn over: for out of her little she 
gives whatever she possesses in order 
to assist the work of the Lord. 

Let the Latter-day Saints remember 
that we have undertaken to strive for 
the celestial kingdom. We desire an 
inheritance on this earth when it is 
celestialized. We expect an inheritance 
in Zion, but in order that we may have 
this inheritance, we are not only re- 
quired to come into the Church by bap- 
tism and confirmation and to receive 
our ordinations and blessings, but we 
are expected to be a prayerful people, 
a people who will observe the Word of 
Wisdom, who will live pure lives and 
keep the commandments of the Lord. 
We are expected to bear the burdens 
and responsibilities of the kingdom, 
temporal as well as spiritual. We are 
in a temporal world, and this is a 
church of material things as well as 
spiritual things. We cannot divide the 
temporal from the spiritual, the body 
from the spirit and stay here. They 
go unitedly, hand in hand, and will do 
throughout mortality, and then 
throughout all the ages of eternity. 
Men are not perfect without immor- 
tality and eternal life. They cannot 
meet the design of God without accom- 
plishing what the Lord has laid before 
us. This is the Lord's work. It is 
not the work of our brethren who have 
passed away. They have finished their 



work here. They have gone to their 
reward, having earned eternal life. We 
remain, and we are to prove our faith- 
fulness and devotion and our endurance 
in the principles of righteousness. The 
Lord will sustain us; this work will 
continue; and we will gain in strength 
and numbers all the time. We are 
spreading abroad and becoming more 
numerous in every ward, in every 
stake, and in every nation where we 
live. The Lord is working with us, 
and is handling the nations. He is 
handling this nation and directing it 
in its operations to extend liberty 
among the people of the world. The 
Gospel will be in the track of religious 
liberty, and will be carried to every 
people. 

I desire to read the 7th verse in the 
85th Section of the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. The preceding verses speak 
in relation to the duty of the Lord's 
clerk in Zion. At present the Lord has 
clerks in all the Stakes of Zion and in 
all the Wards in Zion and the history 
of our faith and works is being kept. 
It is important that these records 
should be kept and correctly kept. A 
singular thing that I have noticed here 
(perhaps you have noticed it as well) 
is that it is not only necessary that our 
names should be found of record, but 
it is necessary that our fathers' names 
should also be found of record, as well 
as the names of our children. It seems 
that when the inheritances in Zion are 
divided out, those whose names are 
recorded with the names of their fath- 
ers and of their children— three genera- 
tions — are to be entitled to inheritances 
in Zion: 

'And it shall come to pass that I, 
the Lord God, will send one mighty 
and strong, holding the sceptre of pow- 
er in his hand, clothed with light for a 
covering, whose mouth shall utter 
words, eternal words; while his bowels 
shall be a fountain of truth, to set in 
order the house of God, and to ar- 
range by lot the inheritances of the 
Saints, whose names are found, and the 
names of their fathers, and of their 
children, enrolled in the book of the 
law of God." 

I have felt it important, not only 
that I should be faithful, but that my 
children should be faithful, and also 
my progenitors, as an evidence that 
there is stability, virtue and integrity 
in that line of blood; that there is 



38 



GEAERAL CONFERENCE. 



fidelity and faithfulness at least in 
three generations, who shall he found 
recorded in the book of the law of God. 
I am anxious for my kindred and my 
posterity. I am not satisfied to be 
alone. I want my family, my kindred 
and my friends with me; hence I de- 
sire to be exemplary and to use my in- 
fluence with them, that they also may 
have a worthy record, and not be cast 
out for apostasy or any other reason, 
but that together the three generations 
may be found recorded and be entitled 
to an inheritance in Zion. If, how- 
ever, our names are not found recorded 
in the book of the law of God, we shall 
not be entitled to an inheritance in 
Zion. We want an inheritance on this 
earth. We want a part of the earth for 
our celestial home and we want to earn 
it. We cannot get it otherwise. As 
the President said today, Zion cannot 
be redeemed but by purchase. Let me 
say to you that your redemption and 
mine cometh only by purchase. We 
must earn what we expect to enjoy. 
We must redeem our part of Zion, and 
as the whole people we must redeem the 
land of Zion. We are promised an 
eternal inheritance in the land of Zion, 
but we cannot get it by any one law 
alone. We cannot get it by tithing 
alone. A man cannot say that he has 
paid his tithing generously and freely, 
and now he has liberty to do just as he 
pleases. He must not only keep the 
law of tithing properly, but he must 
also keep his repentance genuine and 
eternal. His devotion and faithfulness 
to the Lord in every other respect must 
be maintained in addition to the pay- 
ment of tithing. We have but a little 
time to live on this earth. Why can 
we not endure just for a few fleeting 
years, that will be less than a day to 
us hereafter? Fifty, seventy, eighty, 
or a hundred years, we will look upon 
as but a span when we shall have 
entered into eternity, the depth and 
height of which cannot be known in 
mortality. The suffering and the little 
difficulties and evil which beset us in 
this life, and which try our very souls, 
will be counted as naught hereafter. 
We will only wonder that we were ever 
shaken or disturbed at all by the little 
things that afflicted us. 
Brethren and sisters, you have our 



testimony in regard to this principle. 
We know that it is important. It is not 
a new thing that the Lord should be 
robbed in His tithes and His offerings. 
It is not a new thing that the word 
of the Lord should come through a 
Prophet. It came through the Prophet 
Joseph when the law of tithing was 
revealed. It came through him when 
the law of consecration was revealed 
and on a hundred other occasions. 
Many revelations the Lord gave 
through him, and they have been writ- 
ten. Hundreds of times has the word 
of the Lord been given through Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, the Prophet and 
lion of the Lord, and through Presi- 
dent John Taylor and through Presi- 
dent Wilford Woodruff. There is noth- 
ing that the Lord requires of His peo- 
ple that the Prophet of the Lord will 
hesitate to present when it is necessary. 
He is the chief man upon the towers 
of Zion, to warn the people, and when 
a warning comes there is a reason for 
it; there are conditions just confront- 
ing us that we know not of, and per- 
haps they are not told to us. We can- 
not tell you what is coming just now, 
but there are important conditions just 
in front of us as the people of God, 
and it is necessary that the Prophet 
should take the very stand that he has 
in regard to this law, for our safety, 
for the redemption of Zion, for the ac- 
complishment of the purposes of God 
in the last days. Thank the Lord that 
we have a prophet; that we can ap- 
proach him and learn what his mind 
and will is and receive it as we have 
received it in all plainness. And when 
the Lord sDeaks to His servant the 
Prophet, He speaks to all the Prophets. 
President Snow is not alone, but he is 
surrounded by Prophets of the Lord, 
and they have the very same testimony 
abiding in their souls. They know that 
this is God's work, and they have not 
been mistaken. They have been lead- 
ing the people all the time, and the 
Lord has directed them. He will do so 
to the end. Thank the Lord that we 
have Prophets; thank the Lord that 
this congregation is full of men of 
prophecy and of revelation. And they 
are in the missions abroad, as well as 
at home. The world is enlivened today 
with men of inspiration from God.

They speak revelation. They give forth 
the word of the Lord, they bear testi- 
mony, strong and powerful, to the na- 
tions of the earth. In this way the 
purposes of God are progressing and 
advancing, and His work will be ac- 
complished. No power on earth can- 
stay it, for it is God's work. Man has 
not originated it. It is the work of 
our Eternal Father who dwells in the 
Heavens. There is power and virtue 
in it for the salvation of men, and it 
is true and vital. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. Let us be faithful and endure 
but for a little season, and our day of 
rest and peace and welcome into the 
presence of the Father and the Son will 
be sure. Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

Objects of the Law of Tithing — The same Law in 
Ancient Times — Duty of the Leaders of the 
Chuivh in Relation to it — Disastrous Effects of 
Neglect and Beneficent Results of Obedience. 

I desire sincerely that my brethren 
and sisters will exert their faith in my 
behalf, that I may be able to speak 
words of advice, of counsel and of 
warning, as the Spirit of the Lord may 
direct. We have had much valuable 
instruction in relation to our duties as 
Latter-day Saints, not only concerning 
the law of tithing, but also in reference 
to other things, which are as important 
in their place as the law of tithing. 
There is nothing, however, of greater 
importance to the welfare of the Church 
at present than the consideration of 
this law, by which means will be placed 
In the storehouse of the Lord, to meet 
the necessities of the people. My eye 
fell upon a passage in the Book of Mor- 
mon, which speaks of a circumstance 
relative to the payment of tithing. I will 
refer to it by and by. It is one of the 
first that we have any record of in an- 
cient days. I have no doubt that the 
law of tithing has always existed when 
the Lord had a people on the earth. 
The purpose of the law of tithing is 
similar to that of the law of revenue 
which is enacted by every State, every 
county and every municipality in the 
world, I suppose. There is no such 
thing as an organization of men for any 
purpose of importance, without pro- 
visions for carrying out its designs. 
The law of tithing is the law of revenue 



for the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Without it it would be 
impossible to carry on the purposes of 
the Lord. I want to read to you one of 
the objects for which the law of tithing 
is given. It is recorded in Section 83 
of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. 
The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph 
at Independence, Jackson County, Mis- 
souri, April 30, 1832: 

"Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addi- 
tion to the laws of the Church concern- 
ing women and children, those who be- 
long to the Church, who have lost their 
husbands or fathers. 

"Women have claim upon their hus- 
bands for their maintenance until their 
husbands are taken, and if they are not 
found transgressors they shall have fel- 
lowship in the Church; 

'And if they are not faithful, theyshall 
not have fellowship in the Church; yet 
they may remain upon their inheritan- 
ces according to the laws of the land. 

"All children have claim upon their 
parents for their maintenance until 
they are of age. 

'And after that they have claim upon 
the Church, or in other words upon the 
Lord's storehouse, if their parents have 
not wherewith to give them inheri- 
tances. 

"And the storehouse shall be kept by 
the consecrations of the Church, and 
widows and orphans shall be provided 
for, as also the poor. Amen." 

Here is one of the great purposes for 
which the law of tithing is instituted 
in the Church. It is intended that the 
widows shall be looked after when they 
are in need, and that the fatherless and 
the orphans shall be provided for from 
the funds of the Church; that they shall 
be clothed and fed, and shall have op- 
portunity for education, the same as 
other children who have parents to look 
after them. When a child is father- 
less and motherless the Church becomes 
the parent of that child, and it is obli- 
gatory upon the Church to take care of 
it, and to see that it has opportunities 
equal with the other children in the 
Church. This is a great responsibility. 
Have we ever seen the day since the 
Church was organized when we could 
carry out this purpose of the Lord fully, 
and to our heart's content? We have 
not! because we never have had the 
means to do it with. But if men will 
obey the laws of God so that there shall 
be abundance in the storehouse of the 
Lord, we will have wherewith to feed 
and clothe the poor and the orphan and 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to look after those who are in need in 
the Church. Our brethren will not have 
to join these secret associations that 
are formed in the world, for the purpose 
of leaving- a few thousand dollars to 
their widows when they die. If we will 
pay our tithes and our offerings we will 
lay up for ourselves treasure in the 
storehouse of God, by whicn our wid- 
ows and our children will be cared for 
after we are dead, and far better than 
they will be by these associations that 
offer premiums on death. I mention 
this simply incidentally. The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is good enough for me and my family, 
and I have no time or means to associ- 
ate myself with organizations that are 
not of this Church and which have sim- 
ply for their object the laying up of 
something for my wife to have after I 
am dead. I cannot afford to do it, for 
this reason: the Lord has seen fit to 
give me from day to day just sufficient 
for my needs, and if I were to join these 
associations for the purpose of looking 
after the future of my family, I would 
be compelled to neglect paying my 
tithing, and present duties, because I 
would not have means enough to pay my 
tithing and my dues for these associa- 
tions. We have known members of the 
Church, who when they were asked 
why they did not pay their tithing, con- 
fessed that they were associated with 
organizations of one kind and an- 
other, wherein they were compelled 
to pay weekly or monthly certain 
sums of money; they had been 
associated with these institutions 
for a number of years and had 
put quite a lot of money in them, and 
now if they did not continue to pay 
their dues they would lose all they had 
put in, then in case of death their fami- 
lies would lose the premium. From 
this you can see they are in bondage 
to these secret organizations', and if 
they want to pay tithing they cannot 
do it. Well, if they do not they will be 
among those whose names will not be 
found recorded in the book of the Law 
of the Lord and who will not have in- 
heritance in the Zion of God. Further- 
more, we have called some of these men 
to go on missions, but they could not 
go to preach the Gospel to the nations 



of the earth, why? Because they be- 
longed to certain secret associations, 
and they were compelled to be at work 
all the time in order to pay their dues, 
or they would lose what they had put 
in them. 

• I want to say to the Later-day Saints 
that Zion and the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints are good 
enough for me and my family. I do 
not want any of these associations for 
the purpose of laying up money. If 
there were any other object in them by 
which I might be able to do good in the 
world, that might be an inducement. 
But I cannot afford to join any associ- 
ation simply for the purpose of laying 
up money to be received when I am 
dead. I am willing to trust my people in 
the hands of the Lord, just as I have 
been in the hands of the Lord from the 
beginning. 

Now I will read a little from the Book 
of Mormon in regard to the law of tith- 
ing as it existed in ancient days. The 
Prophet Alma, in his 13th chapter, com- 
mencing at the 14th verse says: 

"14. Tea, humble yourself even as 
the people in the days of Melchisedek, 
who was also a High Priest after this 
same order, which I have spoken, who 
also took upon him the High Priest- 
hood forever. 

"15. And it was the same Melchise- 
dek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, 
even our Father Abraham paid tithes of 
one-tenth of all he possesed. 

"16. Now these ordinances were 
given after this manner, that thereby 
the people might look forward on the 
Son of God, it being a type of his order, 
or it being his order; and this, that 
they might look forward to him for a 
remission of their sins, that they might 
enter into the rest of the Lord. 

"17. Now this Melchisedek was a 
king over the land of Salem; and his 
people waxed strong in iniquity and 
abominations; yea, they had all gone 
astray; they were full of all manner of 
wickedness: 

"18. But Melchisedek having exer- 
cised mighty faith, and received the of- 
fice of the High Priesthood, according 
to the holy order of God, did preach re- 
pentance unto his people. And behold, 
they did repent; and Melchisedek did es- 
tablish peace in the land in his days; 
therefore he was called the prince of 
peace, for he was the king of Salem; 
and he did reign under his father. 

"19. Now, there were many before 
him, and also there were many after- 
wards, but none were greater; there- 
fore, of him they have more particular- 
ly made mention." 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



41 



I desire now to read a few words in 
relation to the duty which devolves 
upon the men who have been speaking 
during this conference. I will read a 
portion of the 41st Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants: 

"Hearken and hear, oh ye my people, 
saith the Lord and your God, ye whom 
I delight to bless with the greatest 
blessings, ye that hear me; and ye 
that hear me not will I curse, that have 
professed by name, with the heaviest of 
all cursings. 

"2. Hearken, O ye Elders of my 
Church whom I have called; behold I 
give unto you a commandment, that ye 
shall assemble yourselves together to 
agree upon my word, 

"3. And by the prayer of your faith 
ye shall receive my law, that ye may 
know how to govern my Church, and 
have all things right before me. 

"4. And I will be your ruler when I 
come; and behold, I come quickly, and 
ye shall see that my law is kept." 

The Lord here especially demands of 
the men who stand at the head of this 
Church and who are responsible for the 
guidance and direction of the people of 
God that they shall see to it that the 
law of God is kept. It is our duty to do 
this. We are not talking to you about 
paying your tithing because it is a 
pleasure to do so, or because we desire 
to harp upon that principle; but we are 
doing it because the necessities of the 
people are such that it becomes obli- 
gatory upon the leaders of the Church 
to say something upon this principle, 
that not only the people may do their 
duty in regard to this law, but that 
there may be something in the store- 
house of the Lord with which to meet 
the necessities of the people; for the ne- 
cessities of the Church are the neces- 
sities of the people. The members of the 
Church constitute the Church.and there- 
fore whatever obligation the Church is 
under, it rests upon each individual 
member of the Church proportionate to 
his means. The Lord requires of us that 
we shall see that His law is kept among 
the people. This is one of the principle 
reasons why we are talking to you as 
we are. In Section 82 of the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord 
speaking to the Church says: 

"Verily, verily I say unto you my ser- 
vants, that inasmuch as ye have for- 
given one another your trespasses, even 
so I, the Lord, forgive you. 



"2. Nevertheless there are those 
among you who have sinned exceeding- 
ly; yea, even all of you have sinned, but 
verily I say unto you, beware from 
henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest 
sore judgments fall upon your heads; 

"3. For unto whom much is given 
much is required; and he who sins 
against the greater light shall receive 
the greater condemnation. 

"4. Ye call upon my name for reve- 
lations, and I give them unto you; and 
inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, 
which I give unto you, ye become trans- 
gressors, and justice and judgment 
are the penalty which is affixed unto my 
law; 

"5. Therefore, what I say unto one 
I say unto all, watch, for the adversary 
spreadeth his dominions and darkness 
reigneth; 

"6. And the anger of the Lord kind- 
leth against the inhabitants of the 
earth; and none doeth good, for all 
have gone out of the way. 

"7. And now, verily I say unto you, I 
the Lord, will not lay any sin to your 
charge; go your ways and sin no more; 
but unto that soul who sinneth shall 
the former sins return, saith the Lord 
your God. 

"8. And again, I say unto you, I give 
unto you a new commandment, that you 
may understand my will concerning 
you, 

"9. Or in other words I will give 
unto you directions how you may act 
before me, that it may turn to you for 
your salvation. 

"10. I, the Lord, am bound when ye do 
what I say, but when ye do not what I 
say, ye have no promise." 

Now, Brother Lyman has been talk- 
ing to you about the remission of sins. 
When we commit sin, it is necessary 
that we repent of it and make restitu- 
tion as far as lies in our power. When 
we cannot make restitution for the 
wrong we have done then we must ap- 
ply for the grace and mercy of God to 
cleanse us from that iniquity. 

Men cannot forgive their own sins; 
they cannot cleanse themselves from 
the consequences of their sins. Men 
can stop sinning and can do right in the 
future, and so far their acts are accept- 
able before the Lord and worthy of 
consideration. But who shall repair the 
wrongs they have done to themselves 
and to others, which it seems impos- 
sible for them to repair themselves? By 
the atonement of Jesus Christ, the sins 
of the repentant shall be washed away, 
though they be crimson they shall be 
made white as wool. This is the pro- 
mise given to you through the President 
of the Church today. We who have not 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



paid our tithing in the past, and are 
therefore under obligations to the Lord, 
which we are not in a position at 
present to discharge, he has said 
to us the Lord requires that no longer 
at our hands, but will forgive us for the 
past if we will observe this law honestly 
in the future. That is generous and 
kind, and I feel grateful for it. 

I will read row a few verses from Sec- 
tion 85 of the Book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants, commencing at the 9th verse: 

"And all they who are not found writ- 
ten in the book of remembrance, shall 
find none inheritance in that day, but 
they shall Oe cut asunder, and their 
portion shall be appointed them among 
unbelievers, where are wailing and 
gnashing of teeth. 

"These things I say not of myself; 
therefore, as the Lord speaketh, He will 
also fulfill. 

"And they who are of the High Priest- 
hood, whose names are not found writ- 
ten in the book of the law, or that are 
found to have apostatized, or to have 
been cut off from the Church; as well 
as the lesser Priesthood, or the mem- 
bers, in that day, shall not find an in- 
heritance among the Saints of the Most 
High; 

"Therefore it shall be done unto them 
as unto the children of the priests, as 
will be found recorded in the second 
chapter and sixty-first and second 
verses of Ezra." 

I am going to turn now to Ezra and 
see what is said there. We read: 

"61. And the children of the Priests; 
the children of Habaiah, the children 
of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which 
took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai 
the Gileadite, and was called after 
their name; 

"62. These sought their register 
among those that were reckoned by 
genealogy, but they were not found, 
therefore were they, as polluted put 
from the Priesthood. 

"63. And the Tirshatha said unto 
them, that they should not eat of the 
most holy things, till there stood up a 
Priest with Urim and Thummim." 

This is the position the people will 
be in when they come to claim an in- 
heritance in Zion, if their names are 
not found recorded in the book of the 
law of God. And I want to tell you 
that this refers directly to the law of 
tithing. In the first place it referred 
to the law of consecration, but that law, 
as has been explained, was not properly 
kept, and inasmuch as people are under 
greater condemnation when they keep 
not the laws that are given them, the 



Lord in His mercy withdrew from the 
Latter-day Saints the law of consecra- 
tion, because the people were not pre- 
pared to live it, and as long as it was 
in force and they kept it not they were 
under condemnation. The law of tith- 
ing was given in its place. 

Some people may not care very much 
whether their names are recorded or 
not, but this comes from ignorance 
of the consequences. If their names 
are not recorded they will not only be 
cut off from the assistance which they 
would be entitled to from the Church 
if they needed it, but they will be cut 
off from the ordinances of the house of 
God; they will be cut asunder from 
their dead and from their fathers who 
have been faithful, or from those who 
shall come after them who shall be 
faithful, and they will be appointed 
their portion with the unbelievers, 
where there is weeping and gnashing of 
teeth. It means that you will be cut 
off from your fathers and mothers, 
from your husbands, your wives, your 
children, and that you shall have no 
portion or lot or inheritance in the king- 
dom of God, both in time and in eter- 
nity. It has a very serious and far 
reaching effect. It is therefore the 
more obligatory upon me and upon my 
fellow-servants in the Church of God 
to make these matters known to the 
people, that our skirts may be free from 
their blood. I need not read to you 
from Malachi, but I will read something 
from Amos, who is called one of the 
lesser Prophets. The Prophet says — 
and he says it ironically: 

"4. Come to Bethel, and transgress; 
at Gilgal multiply transgressions; and 
bring your sacrifices every morning, 
and your tithes after three years. 

"5. And offer a sacrifice of thanks- 
giving with leaven, and proclaim and 
publish the free offerings; for this 
liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith 
the Lord God. 

"6. And I also have given you clean- 
ness of teeth in all your cities, and want 
of bread in all your places; yet have ye 
not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

"7. And also I have withholden the 
rain from you, when there were yet 
three months to the harvest; and I 
caused it to rain upon one city, and 
caused it not to rain upon another city; 
one piece was rained upon, and the 
piece whereupon it rained not withered. 

"8. So two or three cities wandered 
unto one city, to drink water; but they

were not satisfied; yet have ye not re- 
turned unto me, saith the Lord. 

"9. I have smitten you with blasting 
and mildew; when your gardens and 
your vineyards, and your fig trees, and 
your olive trees increased, the palmer- 
worm devoured them; yet have ye not 
returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

"10. I have sent among you the pes- 
tilence after the manner of Egypt; 
your young men have I slain with the 
sword, and have taken away your 
horses; and I have made the stink of 
your camps to come up unto your nos- 
trils; yet have ye not returned unto 
me, saith the Lord. 

"11. I have overthrown some of you, 
as God overthrew Sodom and Gomor- 
rah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked 
out of the burning; yet have ye not re- 
turned unto me, saith the Lord. 

"12. Therefore thus will I do unto 
thee, O Israel; and because I will do 
this unto thee, prepare to meet thy 
God, O Israel. 

"13. For, lo, he that formeth the 
mountains, and createth the wind and 
declareth unto man what is his thought, 
that maketh the morning darkness, and 
treadeth upon the high places of the 
earth, the Lord, the God of Hosts, is 
His name. 

"14. Hear ye this word which I take 
up against you, even a lamentation, O 
house of Israel. 

"15. The virgin of Israel is fallen; 
she shall no more rise; she is forsaken 
upon her land; there is none to raise 
her up." 

These were the consequences of dis- 
obedience on the part of ancient Israel, 
the same power reigns today that 
reigned then. 

I have referred you to some of the 
chastisements and promises of punish- 
ments upon those who will not hearken 
unto the Lord nor obey His law. The 
Latter-day Saints are in the midst of 
these mountains for the express pur- 
pose of serving Almighty God. We 
have not come here to serve ourselves 
nor to serve the world. We are here 
because we have believed in the Gospel 
that has been restored in the latter day 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. We 
are here because we believe that God 
Almighty has organized His Church 
and has restored the fullness of the Gos- 
pel and Holy Priesthood. We are here 
because we have received the testi- 
mony of the Spirit of God that the 
course which we have pursued in this 
regard is right and acceptable in the 
sight of the Lord. We are here be- 
cause we have come in obedience to the 
command of the Almighty. 



Now let me show to you how the 
Lord poured out blessings upon His 
people anciently when they obeyed the 
law of tithing. I will read from the 
31st chapter of II Chronicles, com- 
mencing at the 5th verse: 

"5. And as soon as the command- 
ment came abroad, the children of 
Israel brought in abundance the first 
fruits of corn, wine and oil, and honey, 
and of all the increase of the field; and 
the tithe of all things brought they in 
abundantly." 

This is in accordance with the law of 
tithing that was given to the children 
through Moses, as you may read in the 
27th chapter of Leviticus: 

"And concerning the children of 
Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the 
cities of Judah, they also brought in 
the tithes of oxen and sheep, and the 
tithe of holy things which were con- 
secrated unto the Lord their God, and 
laid them by heaps. 

"In the third month they began to 
lay the foundation of the heaps, and 
finished them in the seventh month. 

"And when Hezekiah and the princ- 
es came and saw the heaps, they 
blessed the Lord and His people Israel. 

"Then Hezekiah questioned with 
the Priests and the Levites concerning 
the heaps. 

"And Azariah the chief Priest, of 
the house of Zadok, answered him and 
said, Since the people began to bring 
the offerings into the house of the 
Lord, we have had enough to eat, and 
have left plenty; for the Lord has 
blessed His people; and that which is 
left is this great store." 

In connection with this passage of 
scripture I would remind you of the 
promise made through the Prophet 
Malachi to the children of Israel: 

"Bring ye all the tithes into the 
storehouse, that there may be meat in 
mine house, and prove me now here- 
with, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will 
not open you the windows of Heaven, 
and pour you out a blessing, that there 
shall not be room enough to receive it. 

"And I will rebuke the devou'f" foi 
your sakes, and he shall not destroy 
the fruits of your ground; neither shall 
your vine cast her fruit before the time 
in the field, saith the Lord of hosts." 

I know that the Lord will do this to 
those who fear Him and work righte- 
ousness before Him. 

I refer you now to the 28th chapter of 
Deut., and also to the 26th chapter 
of Leviticus. They run almost parallel. 
I will read from the 28th chapter of 
Deut:

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"And it shall come to pass, if thou 
shalt hearken diligently unto the voice 
of the Lord thy God, to observe and to 
do all His commandments which I com- 
mand thee this day, that the Lord thy 
God will set thee on high above all na- 
tions of the earth. 

"And all these blessings shall come 
on thee and overtake thee, if thou shalt 
hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy 
God. 

"Blessed shalt thou be in the city, 
and blessed shalt thou be in the field. 

"Blessed shall be the fruit of chy 
body, and the fruit of thy ground, and 
the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of 
thy kine, and the flocks of thy shear- 

"Blessed shall be thy basket and 
thy store. 

"Blessed shalt thou be when thou 
comest in, and blessed shalt thou be 
when thou goest out. 

"The Lord shall cause thine ene- 
mies that rise up against thee to be 
smitten before thy face; they shail 
come out against thee one way, and 
flee before thee seven ways. 

"The Lord shall command the bles- 
sing upon thee in thy storehouses, and 
in all that thou settest thine hand unto; 
and he shall bless thee in the land 
which the Lord thy God giveth chee. 

"The Lord shall establish thee a 
holy people unto Himself, as He hath 
sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the 
commandments of the Lord thy God, 
and walk in His ways. 

"And all people of the earth shall 
see that thou art called by the name 
of the Lord; and they shall be afraid 
of thee. 

"And the Lord shall make thee 
plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy 
body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, 
and in the fruit of thy ground, in the 
land which the Lord sware unto thy 
fathers to give thee. 

"The Lord shall open unto thee 
His good treasure, the Heaven to give 
the rain unto thy land in His season, 
and to bless all the work of thine hand, 
and thou shalt lend unto many nation-?, 
and thou shalt not borrow." 

God hasten the day when this people 
shall be in a position to lend and not 
be under the necessity of borrowing at 
all, and I believe the only remedy that 
is necessary to bring about this result 
is for the people to observe the law of 
tithing. If the people of God would 
pay their tithing honestly we would 
have abundance with which cc build 
Temples and to maintain the work of 
the Lord in the Temples; we would 
have abundance to take care of the 
widows and orphans and the poor in 
our midst. We would not have to ask 
you to donate this little thing and that 
little thing for the benefit of the poor 



but we would have enough to meet all 
of these necessities in my opinion. But 
as long as some people are disobedient 
and neglectful in observing this law, 
those who are willing will of necessity 
be called upon from time to time to 
show their further liberality in main- 
taining the poor. I want to say for the 
benefit of our friends who may be pres- 
ent that the Latter-day Saints do not 
ask their non-Mormon neighbors to feed 
their poor. We do it ourselves and we 
feed hundreds that are not of us be- 
sides. However, those who do not pay 
their tithing are not entitled to the help 
that they would be if they paid their 
tithing. When one comes to a Bishop 
and asks for assistance because of his 
or her straightened circumstances, the 
first thing the Bishop should do is to in- 
quire if he or she is a tithe payer. He 
should know whether the name is on 
the book of the law of the Lord, and 
if not on the book, if he or she has 
been derelict and negligent in relation 
to this principle of tithing, he or she 
has no claim upon the Bishop, neither 
have their children, and if under those 
circumstances the Bishop assists him, 
it will simply be out of pure charity 
and not because such have iny claim 
upon the Church. That is why ihe 
widow who receives assistance from the 
Church should pay her tithing, so that 
her name may be on the records of the 
Church. It is not a law that is ap- 
plicable to one and not to another. If 
the rich may not receive blessings be- 
cause their names are not oa the re- 
cord, then neither shall the poor re- 
ceive blessings in the house of God if 
thMr names are not recorded. So long 
as a poor person receives his or her sup- 
port through the tithings of the people, 
they should be willing to observe the 
law themselves in order that they may 
be entitled to what they receive. They 
should show by their observance of the 
law that they are law-keepers and not 
law-breakers. Our children, as soon as 
they become old enough to earn means, 
should be taught to pay th^ir tithing, 
that their names may be written in the 
t ook of the law of the Lord, 7 o that if 
perchance their fathers die and they 
are left orphans, their names, as weil 
as the names of their parents, will be 
f.iund unon the records and they will 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 



45 



as God lives, be entitled to their sup- 
port and to their education. It is our 
duty to look after these children and see 
that they have an equal, chance with 
those who are more favored with par- 
ents to look after them. 

"And the Lord shall make thee the 
head, and not the tail; and thou shalt 
be above only, and thou shalt no 1 : he be- 
neath; if that thou hearken unto the 
commandments of the Lord, thy God, 
which I command thee this day, to ob- 
serve and to do them." 

These are the promises that the Lord 
made to the people of Israel anciently, 
if they would hearken unto His words 
and obey His laws. 

Now, I want to say to you without 
any hesitancy or fear of successful con- 
tradiction, that the words which [ have 
read in your hearing are as applicable 
to you as they were to the children of 
Israel. You are modern Israel and they 
were ancient Israel. The same Go.l 
spake through His servant Moses that 
speaks today through His servant Lo- 
renzo Snow. Obedience to the laws of 
God will produce the same results to- 
day that it did anciently. To those who 
know the history of ancient Israel ii is 
perhaps not necessary for me to say 
that these words were fulfilled upon 
Israel. As long as they hearkened to 
His word, God did prosper them; He 
did bless their land; He did send them 
the early and the latter rains; He did 
multiply them and strengthen them in 
the land; He did set them on high; He 
did make them His covenant people, 
and they became famous throughout 
the known world. The glory of Solomon 
reached to the uttermost parts of the 
earth. The kings and queens of the 
earth heard of his greatness anil of his 
wisdom. They took pilgrimages to 
Jerusalem to see for themselves and to 
verify the reports they had heard of 
the greatness of the children of Israel. 
The Queen of Sheba went and saw 
Solomon in his glory. She heard of the 
wisdom that fell from his lips and be- 
held the greatness of his kingdom, and 
she said to the king: "It was a true re- 
port that I heard in mine own land of 
thy acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit 
I believed not the words, until I came, 
and mine eyes had seen it; and be- 
hold, the half was not told The: thy 



wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the 
fame which I heard. Happy are thy 
men, happy are these thy servants, 
which stand continually before thee, 
and that hear thy wisdom." 

I commend to you the careful reading 
of the remaining portion of this chapter 
in Deuteronomy. Time will not permit 
me to read it, but I would like you to 
read and contemplate it at your leis- 
ure, for there you will find, as if written 
by eye-witnesses, history of the judg- 
ments of God that subsequently fell up- 
on the children of Israel, with an 
acurate account of the downfall and 
disintegration of the people. They be- 
came a hiss and a byword among the 
nations of the earth. They were 
broken asunder, they were carried cap- 
tive into the various nations of the 
earth; they served under taskmasters; 
from that day unto the present they 
have been under the curse of God 
through disobedience to His laws, and 
they will remain under that curse of 
disobedience so long as they tail to re- 
pent of their sins and return not unto 
the Lord. But just as soon as they will 
hearken to the voice of Malachi and 
return unto the Lord and begin to ob- 
serve His laws and ordinances, then 
will be fulfilled the promise of the an- 
cient Prophet that God will open the 
windows of Heaven and pour out bles- 
sings upon them till they will not have 
room to contain them. But this will 
not be until they repent and turn tin to 
the Lord. Neither will it be with us 
until we repent for there are many of 
us who are just as guilty of disobedi- 
ence to the laws of God today as were 
ancient Israel. Some of us, too, \\ ho 
have pretended to do our duty m regard 
to this law, and who have preached 
obedience to it, have not kept it. We 
go to the books, we see the records of 
men, and in a great measure we know 
what they have done, and I can tell 
you that there are men amongst us who 
stand high in their own estimation and 
in the estimation of the people, who 
have never paid their tithing. Yet these 
men ought to be examples to the \ eople. 
They ought to be saying to the people, 
"come follow me, and do the things that 
I do," but they have not been that class 
of men, though I trust they will be in 
the future. I hope that when they pay

the tithing of their salaries, they will 
also pay the tithing on their dividends 
and on the increase of their flocks and 
herds, and thus pay an honest tithing. 
Thei. we will have abundance in the 
storehouse of the Lord to meet all the 
exigencies of the people. May God help

Singing by the choir: 

Lo! the mighty God appearing, 

From on high, Jehovah speaks! 
Eastern lands the summons hearing, 

O'er the west his thunder breaks. 

Prayer by Elder Benjamin E. Rich. 
The choir sang: 

Zion stands with hills surrounded — 
Zion, kept by power divine; 

All her foes shall be confounded, 
Though the world in arms combine; 

Happy Zion, 
What a favored lot is thine.

like Sa't that has Lost its Savor — Redemption 
of Zion may be Deferred by Disobedience — 
Prophets and Apostles like other Men— Respon-

Kingdom of God. 

I will read a portion of the 84th Sec- 
tion of the Book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants: 

"17. Which Priesthood continueth in 
the Church of God in all generations, 
and is without beginning of days' or end 
of years. 

"18. And the Lord confirmed a Priest- 
hood also upon Aaron and his 6eed, 
throughout all their generations — which 
Priesthood also continueth and abideth 
forever with the Priesthood, which is 
after the holiest order of God. 

"19. And this greater Priesthood ad- 
ministereth the Gospel and holdeth the 
key of the mysteries of the kingdom 
even the key of the knowledge of God; 

"20. Therefore, in the ordinances 
thereof, the power of godliness is mani- 
fest; 

"21. And without the ordinances 
thereof, and the authority of the Priest- 
hood, the power of godliness is not 
manifest unto men in the flesh; 

"22. For without this no man can 
see the face of God, even the Father, 
and live. 



us to be faithful is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang: 

"O come, all ye faithful." 
Benediction by Elder William T. 
Jack. 



DAY. 



"23. Now this Moses plainly taught 

to the children of Israel in the wilder- 
ness, and sought diligently to sanctify 
his people that they might behold the 
face of God; 

"24. But they hardened their hearts 
and could not endure his presence, 
therefore the Lord in His wrath (for 
His anger was kindled against them) 
swore that they should not enter into 
His rest while in the wilderness, which 
rest is the fullness of His glory. 

"25. Therefore he took Moses out of 
their midst, and the Holy Priesthood 
also; 

"26. And the lesser Priesthood con- 
tinued, which Priesthood holdeth the 
key of the ministering of angels and 
the preparatory Gospel; 

"27. Which Gospel is the Gospel of 
repentance and of baptism, and the re- 
mission of sins, and the law of carnal 
commandments, which the Lord in His 
wrath caused to continue with the 
house of Aaron among the children of 
Israel until John, whom God raised up. 
being filled with the Holy Ghost from 
his mother's womb; 

"28. For he was baptized while he 
was yet in his childhood, and was or- 
dained by the angel of God at the time 
he was eight days old unto this power, 
to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, 
and to make straight the way of the 
Lord before the face of His people, to 
prepare them for the coming of the 
.Lord, in whose hand is given all power. 

"29. And again, the offices of Elder 
and Bishop are necessary appendages 
belonging unto the High Priesthood. 

"30. And again, the offices of Teacher 
and Deacon are necessary appendages 
belonging to the lesser Priesthood, 
which Priesthood was confirmed upon 
Aaron and his sons. 

"31. Therefore, as I said concerning 
the sons of Moses — for the sons of 
Moses, and also the sons of Aaron 
shall offer an acceptable offering and 
sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which 
house shall be built unto the Lord in 
this generation, upon the consecrated 
spot as I have appointed; 

"32. And the sons of Moses and of 
Aaron shall be filled with the glory of 
the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the 
Lord's house, whose sons are ye; end

also many whom I have called and sent 
forth to build up my Church. 

"33. For whoso is faithful unto the 
obtaining- these two Priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the magnify- 
ing their calling, are sanctified by the 
Spirit unto the renewing of their 
bodies; 

"34. They become the sons of Moses 
and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, 
end the Church and kingdom, and the 
elect of God; 

"35. And also all they who receive 
this Priesthood receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"36. For he that receiveth my serv- 
ants receiveth me; 

"37. And he that receiveth me re- 
ceiveth my Father; 

"38. And he that receiveth my Fath- 
er, receiveth my Father's kingdom; 
therefore all that my Father hath shall 
be given unto him; 

"39. And this is according to the oath 
and covenant which belongeth to the 
Priesthood. 

"40. Therefore, all those who receive 
the Priesthood, receive this oath and 
covenant of my Father, which he can- 
not break, neither can it be moved; 

"41. But whoso breaketh this coven- 
ant, after he hath received it and alto- 
gether turneth therefrom, shall not 
have forgiveness of sins in this world 
nor in the world to come. 

"42. And all those who come not 
unto this Priesthood which ye have re- 
ceived, which I now confirm upon you 
who are present this day, by mine own 
voice out of the Heavens, and even I 
have given the Heavenly hosts and 
mine angels charge concerning you. 

"43. And I now give unto you a 
commandment to beware concerning 
yourselves, to give diligent heed to the 
words of eternal life: 

"44. For you shall live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the mouth 
of God. 

"45. For the word of the Lord is 
truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, 
and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even 
the Spirit of Jesus Christ;" 

In standing up to address you I do 
so relying entirely upon the blessing of 
God, which I hope to obtain by the as- 
sistance of your faith and prayers. To 
my mind, it is one of the most respon- 
sible positions a human being can oc- 
cupy, to address a congregation upon 
the things pertaining to God and eter- 
nity. I feel the weight of this responsi- 
bility, and I would not attempt to speak 
to you, did I not .know that it is our 
privilege to have the assistance of the 
Spirit of God. During this conference 
we have heard most excellent discours- 
es, accompanied by the power of God. 



The Spirit has been abundantly poured 
out. It seems to me that no man or 
woman could listen to the words of the 
Apostles who have spoken without be- 
ing convinced that God was with them. 
This is my feeling, and I can bear tes- 
timony to the truth of that which has 
been said. It will be a savor of life unto 
life or of death unto death to all those 
who have listened. 

We are living in a very important 
time. The Lord is evidently working 
with His servants and people. He is 
manifesting His Spirit in a remarkable 
manner. I think it has been felt by every 
faithful Latter-day Saint throughout 
the Church. Not only has it extended 
throughout Zion, but it has been felt by 
the Elders and Saints, so far as we have 
heard, in distant places. In 1856 the 
Spirit of God was poured out in great 
power upon the servants of God in 
Zion. I was on a mission at the time, 
as doubtless were very many Elders, 
some of whom may be present today; 
and we had the same Spirit where I 
was laboring. The Lord stirred us up 
in the same way that our brethren at 
home were being stirred up. The 
Spirit of reformation went throughout 
the entire Church. The people were 
stirred from the depth of their hearts 
by the power of God. The effects of 
that reformation were most excellent. 
A great many adopted good resolu- 
tions which, I am led to believe, they 
clung to all their lives, and are still 
clinging to them if they are alive. They 
have served God with greater diligence 
than they ever did before. I do not 
doubt that will be the effect of these 
meetings. I expect to see a thorough 
reformation of the people, and renewed 
determination to keep the command- 
ments of God more strictly than ever 
before. 

In connection with this I will read 
another portion of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants that occurs to my mind. 
It is a revelation that was given in 
1834, soon after the occurrences which 
President Snow read about yesterday. 
They took place in Jackson county, No- 
vember, 1833, and this revelation was 
given to the Prophet the succeeding 
February. The Lord says: 

"1. "Verily I say unto you, my friends, 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



behold I will give unto you a revela- 
tion and commandment, that you may 
know how to act in the discharge of 
your duties concerning the salvation 
and redemption of your brethren, who 
have been scattered on the land- of 
Zion; 

"2. Being driven and smitten by the 
hands of mine enemies, on whom I will 
pour out my wrath without measure in 
mine own time; 

"3. For I have suffered them thus 
far, that they might fill up the meas- 
ure of their iniquities, that their cup 
might be full; 

"4. And that those who call them- 
selves after my name might be chas- 
tened for a little season with a sore 
and grievous chastisement, because they 
did not hearken altogether unto the 
precepts and commandments which I 
gave unto them." 

This has been dwelt upon with great 
fullness by nearly all the brethren who 
have spoken at this conference. They 
have called attention to the fact that 
the Saints were scourged in those early 
days because of their disobedience. The 
Lord here explains and describes to the 
Church very plainly the reasons why 
they were so grievously and severely 
chastened: 

"And that those who call themselves 
after my name might be chastened for 
a little season with a sore and grievous 
chastisement, because they did not 
hearken altogether unto the precepts 
and commandments which I gave unto 
them." 

The Lord continues: 

"5. But verily I say unto you, that I 
have decreed a decree which my peo- 
ple shall realize, inasmuch as they 
hearken from this very hour, unto the 
counsel which I, the Lord their God, 
shall give unto them. 

"6. Behold they 6hall, for I have de- 
creed it, begin to prevail against mine 
enemies from this very hour, 

"7. And by hearkening to observe all 
the words which I, the Lord their God, 
shall speak unto them, they shall never 
cease to prevail until the kingdoms of 
the world are subdued under my feet, 
and the earth is given unto the Saints, 
to possess it for ever and ever. 

"8. But inasmuch as they keep not 
my commandments, and hearken not to 
observe all my words; the kingdoms of 
the world shall prevail against them, 

"9. For they were set to be a light 
unto the world, and to be the saviors 
of men; 

"10. And inasmuch as they are not 
the saviors of men, they are as salt that 
has lost its savor, and is thenceforth 
good for nothing but to be cast out and 
trodden under foot of men." 



There cannot be a doubt in any faith- 
ful man's mind concerning the truth of 
this promise — the promise of victory 
and deliverance on the one hand, the 
promise of punishment, disaster and 
trouble on the other. The Latter-day 
Saints have in their experience proved 
fully the truth of these words. They 
have seen them fulfilled to the very let- 
ter. When they have been faithful in 
keeping the commandments of God they 
have prospered and they have had de- 
liverance. "When they have been un- 
faithful they met with trouble and seri- 
ous difficulty. It is necessary that the 
wicked should have the opportunity to 
exercise their agency in relation to the 
work of God; for they have an agency 
as well as we. It is their privilege to 
assist in building up the work of God, 
or they can exercise their agency in 
fighting the work of God. They have 
the privilege to do everything in their 
power to destroy it, and they will be 
permitted to do this until the cup of 
their iniquity is full. The Lord deals 
justly with His children, no matter who 
they are. Not only Latter-day Saints, 
but all mankind are the children of 
our Heavenly Father, and all have their 
agency. When we quote these sayings 
of the Lord concerning this work, they 
are not peculiar to us; the promises are 
not intended for us alone; they are in- 
tended for all who will believe and obey 
His Gospel. Many people imagine that 
when we talk about the triumph of the 
Church of God we mean to confine that 
triumph to those who belong to our 
Church. Not . so; this is for the whole 
world. It is for all America, as well 
as for Utah. God has made most glori- 
ous promises to this nation. According 
to the revelations in the Book of Mor- 
mon concerning our own nation, the 
Lord has destined to make it the head 
of all the nations of the earth, to adopt 
it as His nation and as His govern- 
ment, if the people would receive the 
Gospel; and He would make them the 
means of saving the remnants of His 
covenant people, and doing other 
mighty works. This is all foreshadowed 
in the prophecies contained in the Book 
of Mormon. 

Joseph Smith, prompted by this Spirit 
— the man whom God has spoken to; a 



PRESIDED T GEORGE Q CANNON 



49 



Prophet of God — condescended to proffer 
himself as a candidate for the Presi- 
dency of the United States. Many peo- 
ple thought this was ambition on his 
part; that he wanted to rule; that he 
aspired to power, and that he would use 
It for the carrying out of his own plans 
and forwarding the interests of his own 
people. Joseph Smith had no such idea. 
He was prompted, as a Prophet of God 
and as a patriot, to step forward and 
offer himself as a candidate, that the 
nation might receive the fulfillment of 
the promises which the Lord had made 
concerning it. He gave his views on 
the power and policy of the United 
States; and any man who will read 
those views today will see how much 
salvation there is embodied in the prin- 
ciples he set forth. A bloody war might 
have been averted; millions of treasure 
might have been saved; thousands upon 
thousands of lives might also have been 
saved, if they had only received him as 
a deliverer, God having inspired him 
to take that course. In relation to this 
we have the same feelings today. Men 
accuse us of being unpatriotic, of not 
being friendly, and of having designs 
inimical to the peace and prosperity of 
the land. I say to you today, in the 
presence of God, that no more patriotic 
people live upon the continent of 
America than the Latter-day Saints. 
We want to see the Constitution of this 
country preserved, that every man shall 
enjoy the rights guaranteed by that 
grand instrument of liberty which God 
inspired the framers to make. But we 
differ from many people in regard to 
our views concerning the manner in 
which the government should be admin- 
istered. And we think, as free men, 
descended from a free ancestry, we 
have a right to differ from them, and 
to express our feelings upon this point 
with the utmost freedom; that we are 
not traitors when we do so, but are the 
friends of the government and of the 
rights of human beings in the govern- 
ment. You know, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that this is our attitude on this 
question. We would like to see this 
government so ©table that it will never 
be thrown down. It can only be made 
so by adhering to the principles which 
animated the founders of the govern- 



ment, and which they hoped to perpetu- 
ate through the constitution and th* 
laws that were enacted. 

We are told in this revelation that 
the wicked, when the cup of their in- 
iquity is full, will receive their judg- 
ment. But the Latter-day Saints are 
called upon to obey the commandments 
of God. He has revealed himself with 
power to them. He bears testimony to 
them all the time concerning His great 
work that He is seeking to establish in 
the earth. He wants to make us the 
saviors of men. He calls us the salt 
of the earth. We are the salt of the 
earth. We are not conceited in saying 
this, because the acts of the faithful 
Latter-day Saints are such as to bring 
salvation to those who are connected 
with them. I wish to illustrate this 
so that you can see it for yourselves. 
Look around you and see the men and 
the women who have proved themselves 
unworthy of the principles of the 
Gospel, and have departed from 
them. Are they not like salt that has 
lost its savor? We have had hundreds 
of them; they have got indifferent; they 
have lost their savor, and are good for 
nothing. The Saints are compared to 
salt that has its saving poperties. 
Wherever we go we should be saviors 
of men. We should seek for the salva. 
tion of the human family to the fullest 
extent in our power. God has' called us 
to this. He has given unto us the Holy 
Priesthood, and He has pled with us 
now for these many years. Think of it! 
this revelation from which I have read 
last was given in 1834, nearly sixty-six 
years ago. The promise was then made 
unto the Saints that if they would keep 
the commandments of God they should 
prevail from that very hour. Is it not 
true that this would have been fulfilled 
to the very letter if we had kept His 
commandments? But we have not done 
so. We have been a disobedient people, 
notwithstanding all that God has done 
for us. We have not honored His laws; 
and I sometimes thnk we are like our 
ancestor®, the children of Israel (for 
God has said that we are of the seed 
of Abraham) who were led out of Egypt 
by mighty power. The Lord wrought 
wonders in their behalf. He inspired 
Moses to lead the people along so that 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they could see the face of God, that 
they could have the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood continued among them, and be- 
come a nation of kings and priests; but 
they were hard in their hearts and re- 
jected the word of God. The result was 
that for forty years they wandered in 
the wilderness, and all that generation 
were buried in the wilderness, except 
two men. Two men only out of the vast 
host that left Egvpt under the leader- 
ship of Moses, ever reached the prom- 
ised land, and they were Caleb and 
Joshua. The Lord had a new genera- 
tion. The fathers had rejected Him, 
and He took the Melchisedek Priesthood 
from their midst, with Moses, and He 
gave unto them the lesser Priesthood, 
which was confirmed upon Aaron and 
his seed. They administered the law 
of carnal commandments. And this be- 
cause they did not have faith enough 
to receive all that Moses< was willing to 
teach them! 

Shall we be in the same condition? 
Shall we, through hardness of heart and 
disobedience to God and His servants, 
bring upon ourselves the same penalty? 
I do not believe we will. I am sure we 
will not reject the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood, its power and its> ordinances. But 
I do fear that we will defer the redemp- 
tion of Zion indefinitely through our 
unwillingness to do the things that God 
requires at our hands. I have not an 
earthly doubt that this revelation given 
in 1834 would have been fulfilled to the 
very letter, had our people obeyed the 
Lord as He desired; neither do I be- 
lieve now that the redemption of Zion 
will be long deferred if the people will 
obey the Lord and keep His command- 
ments. But the difficulty is, our 
hearts are hard and almost impenetra- 
ble, in many instances. Here President 
Snow has been preaching for four 
months now in relation to the payment 
of tithing; he has been laboring with all 
his might, to the astonishment of all 
those who know his age; and yet he 
cannot rest — he has to here preach it 
again, because he feels that the people 
need to be stirred up. I tell you that 
all that is not for nothing. I tell you 
that the man of God is not aroused and 
inspired for nothing. There is a mean- 
ing to it. And I feel that great con- 



demnation—such condemnation proba- 
bly as has never rested upon us before, 
will rest upon this people unless they 
obey with all their hearts the words of 
the Lord that He has given to us 
through His servant. 

We need to be born again, and have 
new hearts put in us. There is too 
much of the old leaven about us. We 
are not born again as we should be. Do 
you not believe that we ought to be 
born again? Do you not believe that 
we should become new creatures in 
Christ Jesus, under the influence of the 
Gospel? All will say, yes, who under- 
stand the Gospel. You must be born 
again. Tou must have new desires, 
new hearts, so to speak, in you. But 
what do we see? We see men following 
the ways of the world just as much as 
though they made no pretensions to be- 
ing Latter-day Saints. Hundreds of 
people who are called Latter-day 
Saints you could not distinguish from 
the world. They have the same desires, 
the same feelings, the same aspirations, 
the same passions as the rest of the 
world. Is this how God wants us to be? 
No; He wants us to have new hearts, 
new desires. He wants us to be a 
changed people when we embrace His 
Gospel, and to be animated by entirely 
new motives, and have a faith that will 
lay hold of the promises of God. But 
the trouble is, the Prophets of God walk 
around among you, and you see them 
ah the time. "Why, I saw Lorenzo 
Snow today, and he is just like any 
other man. I saw Joseph F. Smith, and 
if I had not known, I might have taken 
him for anyone else. I saw some of 
the Apostles, and they are like other 
men." And because they are like other 
men, therefore they must be rejected. 
It is not supposed that they have more 
power than others. That is a mistake 
that the world has always made. There 
was Moses, one of the mightiest Pro- 
phets that ever lived. Did the children 
of Israel see anything particularly 
mighty in Moses? No; he was one of 
them, and they saw nothing 'exceptional 
about him. Then there was Nephi, an- 
other mighty Prophet. Brother Grant 
read to us a description of him. Did 
Nephi's brethren see anything mighty 
in him? Why, no; there was nothing 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



51 



to distinguish him particularly; and yet 
he was a mighty Prophet whom God 
had raised up. So it was with the Son 
of God Himself, the mightiest being 
that ever trod the earth. He descended 
from the throne of His Father and 
came to earth; but men saw nothing in 
Him different to other men, and they 
crucified Him. Thus it has been in 
every age. There have only been a few 
who have ever discovered the power of 
God as manifested through His serv- 
ants. It is so today. Who recognized 
Joseph Smith as one of the mightiest 
Prophet© that ever lived? Why, the 
Saints themselves received with reluct- 
ance the truths he taught; and men 
slew him, and may possibly have 
thought they were doing God's service 
in doing so. So it has been with those 
who have followed him and have held 
the keys of authority. They have 
passed among their fellow men and re- 
ceived but little recognition. Men 
could see all their faults and failings, 
and could talk about them one to an- 
other; but they could not see the 
divinity in them. It is the same with 
the servants of God in our midst today. 
They are but mortal men, and we see 
their weaknesses and their defects of 
character. These become magnified in 
our e3 r es, and we talk freely about 
them. The result is, we receive their 
words with reluctance; we question the 
word of God that comes through them, 
and wonder if it is not alloyed with 
something of their own. 

What we all need is faith— faith in 
God, faith to believe that which He 
tells us. Here the brethren have been 
laboring for days to tell us what bles- 
sings will attend obedience to the law 
of tithing— how our storehouses will be 
filled, our fields be fertile, etc., in this 
way appealing to our selfishness. We 
seem to be able to reach the people 
better by appealing to their selfish in- 
stincts. If we can make them believe 
that they are going to get something 
in return for what they do, it seems to 
be more effective than any other way. 
It is true that these blessings will fol- 
low; but it shows, my brethren and 
sisters, how our hearts have to be 
reached. We do not have faith. If 
we had faith as we should have, it 
would not be necessary to use sueh 



arguments. We are like the children of 
Israel when they fled out of Egypt. 
They did not have faith. They were 
enveloped in the traditions of their 
fathers. They were an adolatrous peo- 
ple, and had lived among the Egyptians 
until they had imbibed many of their 
false notions. It took forty years wan- 
dering in the wilderness to get rid of 
the traditions they had imbibed, not- 
withstanding the mighty works which 
God did in their midst. We should en- 
deavor to profit by the lessons of the 
past. Let us put away our hardness of 
heart. Let us be a distinct people. Let 
us try to realize that we should be 
born of God; that we should have new 
desires in our hearts; that we should 
put away everything that is offensive 
in the sight of God, and endeavor to 
live in strict conformity to the laws 
and commandments that He has given 
unto us. There is a class of people in 
our midst that probably will not be 
obedient. We shall have that to con- 
tend with as long as Satan is unbound; 
for he has power over the hearts of the 
children of men. But we should en- 
deavor to lessen his power to the ex- 
tent of our ability. 

In this connection a great deal de- 
pends upon the parents. My parents 
were exceedingly strict in exacting 
obedience from their children. The les- 
sons I learned in my boyhood I have 
never forgotten. They have been of 
service to me in my labors among the 
people and with the servants of God. 
I do not wish to say anything of a 
boastful nature, but I never have had 
the least difficulty thus far in my life 
in obeying the servants of God. This 
habit of obedience was formed in me 
when I was a child, and I have thanked 
God many times that my parents were 
so determined that their children 
should be obedient to them. As a re- 
sult of their training, it has been no 
trouble to me to come or to go, to do 
this or that, at the request of the serv- 
ants of God. Yet those who know me 
regard me, no doubt, as a man who 
likes his own way. That is my nature. 
It is a pleasure to me to have my own 
way. I am positive in my nature. But 
it has also been a pleasure to me to 
obey the servants of God. I say to 
my folks that that is the way we 



52 



GENERAL CONFEREE C E. 



should raise our children. They should 
be made to do that which is required 
of them. If the Latter-day Saints as 
a people would enforce obedience in 
the home, our children would grow up 
and become men and women who would 
obey God, who would listen to His 
word, and be as strict in observing it 
as they had been to obey the word of 
their parents. But instead of that you 
see the rudeness of some of our child- 
ren. The manner in which they con- 
duct themselves at times is disgrace- 
ful. I feel mortified occasionally at 
the behavior of our children. There 
will be a meeting here tonight of the 
Sunday school workers, and we shall 
be under the necessity of having police- 
men, if we can obtain them, to main- 
tain order outside the building and to 
prevent the meeting being disturbed 
by the boisterous conduct of a class 
of boys and girls. This is one of the 
things we should attend to. 

I feel to say that all the evils we 
suffer from are due to our disobedience 
and hardness of heart. The persecu- 
tions that we have endured are trace- 
able to this. Our future persecutions 
will be attributable to the same cause. 
Therefore how necessary it is that we 
should train our children to be obedient 
to authority. If we will do this, it 
will be an easy thing for them to obey 
when they are men and women. A 
girl thus trained makes a good wife. 
A boy thus trained makes a good hus- 
band. Send him on a mission, and the 
presiding authority there will see the 
difference between him and the one 
not trained in habits of obedience. I 
have noticed it in my experience in the 
world. We should think of the future 
of our children. We should not let 
them have their own way in everything. 
They should be taught that it is not 
right, but that they should submit to 
the judgment of those who are over 
them- And we should submit to the 
will of our Father in Heaven, what- 
ever He requires at our hands. If it 
is to give our tithing, all right. If it 
is to consecrate, all right. We should 
have faith that the Lord has power 
to bless us according to our devotion 
and diligence in keeping His command- 
ments. 

I trust that what has been said at 



this conference will not be lost sight 
of and forgotten by us. I want to see 
Zion redeemed. I pray for the redemp- 
tion of Zion. I labor for it. It will be 
brought about by peaceful methods. 
Nobody need be afraid of the designs 
of the Latter-day Saints. We have no 
designs only to keep the command- 
ments of God. We have no evil de- 
signs on anybody. We invite every- 
body to come and partake of liberty 
with us. We will defend men of every 
creed and of every denomination in 
their rights as quickly as we will our 
own people. 

Joseph Smith taught us a lesson be- 
fore he died in this respect, and it 
should never be forgotten. It will 
never be by those familiar with the 
circumstances. He invited men not of 
us to take part in certain things, as 
an example of what would be in days 
to come. They did not belong to our 
Church; I do not know that they be- 
longed to any church. Some people 
have found fault with me because on 
one occasion I made a little distinc- 
tion between the Kingdom of God and* 
the Church of God. Now, there is a 
distinction, and Joseph Smith illustrat- 
ed it. He showed us that when the 
Lord's kingdom should be established, 
people of every creed and of n6 creed 
should have perfect liberty and protec- 
tion under it. It will not be for the 
Latter-day Saints alone; it will be for 
the orotection of the Church of God 
and every other church. God does not 
deprive men of their agency. He lets 
them worship according to their con- 
sciences. If they want to be Method- 
ists, or Episcopalians, or Catholics, or 
Agnostics, or anything else, all right. 
They can follow Confuscius, or they 
can believe as the Hindoos do, or any- 
thing else, so long as they do not tres- 
pass upon the rights of their neighbors. 
They cannot do that. They have no 
right to force their belief on other peo- 
ple, or to war on other people because of 
their belief. God never did that. He will 
bless everyone of every creed who will 
serve Him to the best of his ability, 
and especially those who seek to pre- 
serve the rights of their fellowmen. 
For God loves His children, and He 
wants them to have their full agency. 
Of coarse, if they rebel against Him. 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL.

and reject His laws and ordinances, 
they must meet the penalty. As a peo- 
ple, we ought to feel the utmost kind- 
ness and to grant the utmost liberty 
to everyone. We exhibited that feeling 
when we first came to this valley. In 
1849, when the emigration came through 
here to California, I well remember 
how many preachers were invited to 
speak in our old Tabernacle on the 
corner of this block, because President 
Young said he wanted the people to 
hear these men and their views. For 
years this was done. Prominent min- 
isters were invited to speak to us. I 
remember Methodist Bishops and oth- 
ers preaching to us in this Tabernacle. 
Why? Because we were willing to ex- 
tend liberty to everybody. In return, 
we ask that they will not trespass upon 
us. We think we have a right to wor- 
ship God in our own way, and w© try 
to worship Him in that way which will 
be acceptable to Him. 

My brethren and sisters, I ask God 
to bless you — bless you in your families 
and in everything pertaining to you. 
Let us labor continually for the re- 
demption of Zion and for the time 
when the promises which God has 
made to Zion will be fulfilled; that we 
may build the centre Stake of Zion, 
and rear the house of the Lord there. 
There are men standing in this genera- 
tion that will see it accomplished; but 
we do not want it put off to the very 
last. Let us all strive to fit and qualify 
ourselves and our families, by obeying 
the commandments of God to the full- 
est extent, so that we and our families 
may be remembered among those who 
shall be counted worthy to take part in 
the glorious work of redeeming Zion 
and enjoying the blessings thereof, 
which I humbly ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 



ELDER J. G. KIMBALL. 

Carrying the Gospel to the Nations- The Duty of 
the Seventy. 

I am very desirous that I may have 
your attention as well as your faith 
and prayers for a short time. I am 
able to testify to the truth of all that 
has been spoken unto yon during this 
conference. I believe with all my heart 



in the temporal salvation of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and I believe that the Lord will deliver 
us from our troubles and difficulties if 
we will observe all His words. I am 
also very deeply interested In the spirit- 
ual salvation of the children of men. I 
believe that that angel which John saw 
flying in the midst of Heaven with 
the everlasting Gospel to preach to 
every nation, kindred, tongue and peo- 
ple, came to the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and delivered his message, and that a 
great responsibility rests upon the 
Church today to see to it that this mes- 
sage is delivered to the nations of the 
earth. As has been stated, there are 
doubtless between seventeen and eigh- 
teen hundred missionaries throughout 
the world preaching the Gospel. In my 
opinion, not less than five hundred 
thousand dollars is spent each year in 
sending out our Elders, in distributing 
books and tracts and in preaching the 
Gospel throughout the world. 

I desire to speak, if I can have the 
spirit of my calling, more particularly 
to the Seventies of the Church of Jesus 
Christ. The special calling of the First 
Council of Seventy is as witnesses of 
the Lord to the nations of the earth, 
under the direction of the Twelve Apos- 
tles. There are something like one 
hundred and twenty-two quorums of 
Seventy in the Church of Jesus Christ, 
numbering nearly eight thousand men. 
Over each quorum there are seven Pres- 
idents, the Lord having arranged it so 
that six of them can go on missions, 
and always leave one to look after the 
remainder. And in my opinion there 
should not be very many remaining to 
look after. 

I want to read from the book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants and ascertain 
what the Lord has to say about the 
Seventies. You will have to excuse me 
for occupying the time in talking about 
the Seventies, for our labor among 
them puts me a good deal in mind of 
the Filipinos. They shoot and then 
run, and that is about the way we 
have been doing. We would have a 
little time between meetings to talk 
to our Seventies; then we would shoot 
and run and never ascertain whether 
we had killed any one or not— that is 



54 



GENERAL COISiFEREISi CE. 



metaphorically speaking-. "We did not 
know whether we had any good effect 
on our Seventies or not. I believe that 
our Seventies are not doing their work 
as they should do it. I know you Seven- 
ties will not like it, and it will not 
make me popular with you, but I de- 
sire to say that there is a percentage 
of the Seventies than whom there are 
no more faithful men in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But 
the other percentage I have not much 
to say about. This is what the Lord 
says: 

"And it is according to the vision, 
showing the order of the Seventy, that 
they should have seven Presidents to 
preside over them, chosen out of the 
number of the Seventy. 

"And the seventh President of these 
Presidents is to preside over the six; 

"And these seven Presidents are to 
choose other Seventy besides the First 
Seventy, to whom they belong, and 
are to preside over them; 

"And also other Seventy, until seven 
times Seventy, if the labor in the vine- 
yard of necessity requires it. 

"And these Seventy are to be travel- 
ing ministers unto the Gentiles first, 
and also unto the Jews; 

"Whereas other officers of the Church, 
who belong not unto the Twelve, 
neither to the Seventy, are not under 
the responsibility to travel among all 
nations, but are to travel as their cir- 
cumstances shall allow, notwithstand- 
ing they may hold as high and respon- 
sible offices in the Church. 

"Wherefore now let every man learn 
his duty and to act in the office in 
which he is appointed, in all diligence. 

"He that is slothful shall not be 
counted worthy to stand, and he that 
learns not his duty and shows himself 
not approved, shall not be counted 
worthy to stand. Even so. Amen." 

I want to ask the Latter-day Saints 
if they have ever heard of a Seventy 
being handled that is slothful and care- 
less regarding his duties. I have heard 
of men being handled who waded out 
into the mysteries of the kingdom and 
commenced advocating false doctrine. 
One brother asked me the other day if 
I had ever heard of a man being han- 
dled for not knowing anything, and I 
could not remember a single case of 
that kind in the history of the Church. 
I want to say to the Seventies, the High 
Priests and the Elders, that I do not 
believe the Lord is well pleased with 
the children of men in that they do 
not qualify themselves and learn their 
duty and perform the labor that rests 



upon them. I desire to proclaim from 
this stand that, as a Seventy in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, as a witness of the Lord to the 
nations of the earth, I am willing 1 to 
go forth and cry aloud to the children 
of men repentance, and I ask no Sev- 
enty to do what I am not willing to do 
myself. I have the faith to testify, 
and am willing to> do so, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, notwith- 
standing it is unpopular to do this. I 
consider that Elder Ben E. Rich and 
Elder Kelsch and other Elders that 
have been appointed to labor in the 
ministry have never had conferred up- 
on them greater blessings and honors 
in all their history. They are honored 
of God, and if they have the spirit of 
God resting upon them, which they do 
have, they will be sorrowful when they 
are released from that labor, and when 
they have to come back and go to their 
little plodding along, hunting their lit- 
tle farm and getting a little work to do. 
I read in the scriptures that some one 
says that he would rather be a living 
dog than a dead lion. So far as I am 
concerned, I would rather be a dead 
lion. I would rather go forth and 
preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and I want to do it while I am 
young and full of vigor and life. When 
I get old I will come back and go into 
the High Priests' quorum and labor, 
while some other young men preach the 
Gospel. I believe that the Seventies 
quorums ought to be made up of young 
men. The saying is "Old men for 
counsel and young men for war," and 
this is a warfare. If we do not kill 
anybody, everybody wars upon us. I 
believe that aged men ought to go into 
the High Priests' quorum. I want to 
say it right from this stand, so that 
when they call upon us for mission- 
aries, we will have able-bodied men 
and men who are willing to go forth 
and preach the Gospel. We do not want 
any Seventies that are run by their 
wives either. I do not blame the wiv ■ 
for running their husbands, because I 
think we have Seventies that their 
wives ought to run. I hear it almost 
every day (I do not want you to think 
it at home either) "What a lovely hus- 
band that man is. If I only had a 
husband like that I would be happy." 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG.

I ask what kind of a husband he is. 
"Well, he shakes the quilts, he puts 
the carpets down, he helps wash the 
dishes, he helps dress the children," 
etc. Well, if it takes all that to make 
a good man, you cannot count me in 
among them. I would rather go on a 
mission, and I would rather stay and 
die with my neck in the collar. I 
think it is honorable to do these things 
when you are at home, but if I have 
to do them, I want to stay at home 
but a very little while. I do not be- 
lieve that God gave a man the Holy 
Melchisedek Priesthood and ordained 
him a Seventy in the Church of Jesus 
Christ, to be tagging after one little 
woman and spending his whole life in 
that way. That is what I want to say 
to you Seventies; I have said it and I 
don't propose to take it back. The Lord 
bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem: 

Light and Truth. 
Benediction by Elder P. S. Bram- 
well.

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope you 
will give me your faith and attention, 
that the Spirit of the Lord may rest 
upon me, that we may be edified to- 
gether. 

The solemnity of these great gather- 
ings and the spirit thereof that has 
Beemed to fill every breast, causing us 
to come together, and the words of in- 
spiration to which we have listened 
during this conference, have given me 



food for reflection, a little deeper, I 
think, than I have ever had before. It 
has aroused within me a new determi- 
nation and a resolve, the Lord being 
my helper, to assist you and to ask 
you to assist me, as a band of brethren 
and sisters, as servants and hand- 
maidens of the Lord, to be more faith- 
ful in the future than we have been 
in the past. 

The Lord has been with this people. 
We have gathered to this goodly land, 
notwithstanding the displeasure of the 
Lord in His judgments which He meted 
out to His Church in the days when 
they were inhabitants of the States of 
Missouri and Illinois; although, in the 
beginning of their settlement in those 
States, the Lord was with them, and 
His Spirit, to a very great degree, in- 
spired the leaders of the people and 
inspired many of the Saints to hearken 
to the commandments of the Lord. 
But it was with the Saints as it was 
with the Nephites and Lamanites in the 
days when they inhabited this land. 
There were times when the people were 
full of faith and good works and were 
earnest in keeping the commandments 
of the Lord, and then there were times 
when the Nephites and Lamanites 
dwindled into unbelief and grew covet- 
ous and selfish and became lifted up 
in the pride of their hearts, and, finally, 
the favor of the Lord was withdrawn 
from them, and they wandered in dark- 
ness and unbelief until the judgments 
of the Lord awakened them again to 
a sense of their fallen condition, which 
occurred many times, as we are in- 
formed by the history of that people. 
Now, the Lord decreed, through His 
servants, the Nephite Prophets, that 
the people who inhabited this land 
should serve Him and keep His com- 
mandments, or they should not pros- 
per in the land. 

Reference was made today by our 
Prophet, Seer and Revelator, Lorenzo 
Snow, to the judgments of the Lord 
that came upon the people in the Stat* 
of Missouri, in Jackson County, in 1833. 
The Saints were driven from their 
homes and stripped of their possessions, 
not because they were the most wicked 
people upon the face of the land, nor 
because the Lord had cast them off 
forever, but because He was reminding 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them of the covenants they were under 
and the necessity of their keeping 
them. He was reminding them, I say, 
of these truths, by these chastisements 
which He had permitted to come upon 
them, renewing their faith and con- 
fidence in Him and humbling them be- 
fore Him that He might again bless 
them and pour out upon them blessings 
and favors which he had in store for 
His faithful children. And truly, as 
President Cannon reminded us, the 
revelation of the Lord, in 1834, was 
given through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, saying that inasmuch as the 
people had been chastened and had re- 
pented, the Lord was willing to accept 
of their repentance, if they would turn 
unto Him with full purpose of heart 
and serve Him and keep His command- 
ments. Now, although they were 
awakened from their slothful condition 
and were caused to repent of their 
former neglect and sins, through the 
grace and favor of the Lord, after hav- 
ing been chastened sufficiently, yet we 
are informed that they again became 
slothful and careless and failed to keep 
the commandments of the Lord, and, 
finally, He permitted their enemies to 
drive them from the State of Missouri 
to Illinois, where they built a city under 
the direction of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, in Hancock County, called 
Nauvoo, or Commerce. Here the Saints 
prospered for a little season, although 
the land upon which they had settled 
was unhealthy and malarial. Malarial 
fever seized the Saints in Nauvoo and 
in Montrose, situated just across the 
river, and they suffered very sorely 
from sickness and disease of a dread- 
ful nature for a number of months 
after settling in that place. To such 
an extent did they suffer that the Lord 
was moved to compassion on account of 
their condition, and He whispered to 
His Prophet Joseph Smith, who called 
some of his valiant brethren around 
him and went from house to house in 
Commerce, or Nauvoo, and in Mont- 
rose, administering to the Saints and 
commanding them in the name of Jesus 
Christ to arise from their beds of afflic- 
tion and walk and be made whole. 
Wherever they went and these com- 
mands were given in the homes of the 
Latter-day Saints, they were obeyed, 



and the sick were healed instantly. 

I cite this to show that notwithstand- 
ing the displeasure of the Lord and 
these judgments which He had per- 
mitted to come upon His people, He 
was very merciful unto them whenever 
they would humble themselves before 
Him, promising that they would strive 
to serve Him. He was willing to return 
unto them if they would return unto 
Him, according to the words of the 
Prophet Malachi. 

The trials of the Saints in the city of 
Nauvoo seemed to have culminated into 
the greatest sorrow they had ever ex- 
perienced. It was heaped upon them in 
the martrydom of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and his brother Hyrum, in 
Carthage jail, in 1844. I say, this seem- 
ed like the culminating sorrow of the 
Latter-day Saints, but no one need sup 
pose, however, that it was because of 
transgression that these two great men 
fell under the hands of a guilty mob. 
These great men were born to a divine 
mission, even as our Savior Jesus 
Christ, our Elder Brother, and when 
that mission was completed on the 
earth, the Lord had decreed that they 
should seal their testimonies with their 
blood. They never shrank from its ful- 
fillment, knowing that this was the de- 
cree of the Lord, and knowing also that 
they were going to their death when 
they left the city of Nauvoo. The Pro- 
phet turned to his traveling compan- 
ions and said: "I am going like a lamb 
to the slaughter, but I am calm as a 
summer morning. I have a conscience 
void of offence toward God and toward 
all men. If they take my life, I shall 
die an innocent man, and my blood 
shall cry from the ground for ven- 
geance, and it shall yet be said of me, 
'He was murdered in cold blood.' " 

Shortly after the death of the Pro- 
phet, the Lord declared, through Brig- 
ham Young — and I am Inclined to be- 
lieve that here again it was necessary 
to awaken the people, who, from their 
sorrow, had fallen almost into a condi- 
tion of lethargy — the Lord declared 
through Brigham Young, the leader of 
the Church then, and the successor to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, that unless 
the brethren and sisters laid hold of 

the work again in prosecuting their 

labors upon the Temple in Nauvoo, 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



51 



and finished it, that it might be dedi- 
cated to the Lord, they would be cut 
off with their dead. This aroused the 
Saints again to a sense of their duty 
to God and His cause, and they went 
to with their might, with their faith 
and works, never ceasing until they had 
completed that house and dedicated it, 
renewing, under the direction of Presi- 
dent Brigham Young, the ordinances of 
God's holy house and Temple, for the 
redemption of the living and the dead. 

We came to this land of the west, my 
brethren and sisters, to the Rocky 
Mountains, "Willing, because we were 
obliged to," as President George A. 
Smith used to say. The Prophet Joseph 
said that the Saints should be driven 
to the west, even to the Rocky Moun- 
tains, and that many then living would 
yet go to the Rocky Mountain valleys, 
and that there the Saints should plant 
their feet and grow to become a great 
and mighty people. We have seen the 
fulfillment of this great prediction, 
thus far, my brethren and sisters, and 
today we are brought face to face with 
living truths. 

The Prophet Joseph laid down his 
life because God decreed that it should 
be so, and He permitted him and his 
brother Hyrum to be martyred for the 
cause of truth. Again a Prophet was 
selected by the power of Almighty God 
and placed to lead the people, in the 
person of Brigham Young. After the 
Prophet Brigham's demise another Pro- 
phet was raised up by the power of 
revelation from God the Eternal 
Father, and he, too, stood as the leader 
of Israel all the remaining days of his 
life, never flinching, never swerving 
from any duty laid before him, stand- 
ing in the majesty of his calling to 
promulgate to the people the word of 
the Lord; and so it was when President 
John Taylor passed away. It was so 
with President Wilford Woodruff, who 
succeeded to that prophetic ministry, 
to lead and guide Israel and to declare 
unto them the mind and will of the 
Lord. And now another Prophet stands 
with the same keys of authority, with 
the same power of the Holy Priesthood 
resting upon him. And so it is today. 
Our Prophet, the Prophet of the Lord, 
the Prophet of the Mighty God of Ja- 
cob, Lorenzo Snow, declares unto us as 



a congregation today, as the congrega- 
tion of Israel everywhere, he declares 
unto us, as our spokesman, as the 
spokesman of the Lord, that it Is neces- 
sary for us to reform in our lives. 
These are the conditions that confront 
us today, the time when we are to 
observe the commandments of the Lord 
and accept of the word of the Lord as 
given through His servant the Pro- 
phet. We could bring up by referring 
to the history of God's people, both in 
ancient and modern times, year after 
year, and decade after decade, in- 
stances to show that the Lord has min- 
istered unto His children when they 
have entered into covenants with Him 
and have kept those covenants, and 
He has blessed them abundantly from 
time to time; then again, at times, He 
has brought upon them His judgments, 
showing His displeasure unto them for 
not keeping His commandments as they 
should have done. Then they have re- 
pented, and again the clouds of dark- 
ness and persecution have lifted, and 
the Saints made to rejoice in the sun- 
beams, in the light of God's favor and 
countenance, after the dark clouds have 
passed. 

We are a blessed people. We have 
our homes here in the valleys of the 
mountains, which is the land of Joseph, 
the land of Zion, dedicated centuries 
ago by the Prophets of the living God 
to be the land of Joseph, whereon Zion 
should be established in the latter days, 
even the New Jerusalem, that is to be 
built up here, as foreseen by the Pro- 
phets of the Nephite nations. At the 
present time we are living in that day 
and age of the world when these pre- 
dictions are to be literally fulfilled. If 
the Lord can have His way, for He 
said, on one occasion, to the Saints 
while they were in the State of Mis- 
souri, and since their expulsion from 
that state, that Zion could be redeemed 
today, it could have been redeemed be- 
fore today, if His people were ready 
for this redemption. Therefore, this 
proves to me, my brethren and sisters, 
beyond the power of contradiction, that 
the Lord is ready to redeem Zion and 
to make His people a great power, and 
the head and front in the earth, 
through His grace, whenever they are 
prepared for it.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I was very much impressed by the re- 
marks of Apostle Woodruff in regard to 
the reclamation of lands and the tak- 
ing of farms, utilizing these beautiful 
lands in the valleys of the mountains 
for the Saints and their children and 
making homes for themselves and be- 
coming owners of the soil upon which 
the Lord has so mercifully planted Hi3 
people. 

A few weeks ago I attended the Na- 
tional Irrigation Congress, at Missoula, 
Mont. The State of Utah was there 
honored to a very great degree. The 
members of the congress and those who 
attended knew that Utah was the lead- 
er, the educator, in irrigation and in 
the redeeming arid lands; conse- 
quently, they looked to the delegates 
from Utah to say something to them in 
regard to the methods of reclaiming 
the arid lands of this state, and our 
methods of colonizing. In the territory 
of Arizona alone, where a few of our 
people have settled and where four 
Stakes of Zion have been organized, 
there are many hundreds of thousands, 
and possibly several million, acres of 
land lying idle, ready for the labor of 
the husbandman. All it needs is the 
aid and help of the general government 
to assist us in getting water onto that 
desert land, by impounding the streams 
and floods during high water season, In 
the spring, for use during the dry sea- 
son. The Irrigation Congress hopes to 
obtain this aid from the government 
in the near future, in order to bring 
this land into a condition that the 
farmers may possess it and make them- 
selves homes. This land lies in the 
great orange belt, and there is no better 
soil or climate for the production of all 
the tropical fruits than this now arid 
land in Arizona, which is lying idle, 
numbering hundreds of thousands of 
acres, waiting for the water to be 
turned onto it. 

The Lord brought His people here 
for a purpose, and that purpose was 
that they might more faithfully serve 
Him than they could have done In the 
land from which they were expelled; 
also for the purpose of redeeming this 
barren waste, which had to be re- 
deemed and which needed the power of 
God to do it, manifested through His 
devoted servants, who would devote 



their lives, time and talents to the re- 
demption of this soil that was so sterile 
and forbidding in its appearance when 
the pioneers landed upon it. The Lord 
knew the character of the men whom 
He had appointed for this work, and 
He loved them; and His people have 
gathered here with the pioneers by the 
thousands and tens of thousands, from 
all nations, and from the isles of the 
sea, and they have come here with the 
desire and intention of serving the 
Lord, through His grace and favor. 
They dedicated to the Lord the land, 
the water, the elements, and everything 
surrounding them, in order that His 
blessings might be upon them and 
their labors, and upon the soil, and the 
Lord has indeed blessed His people. 

Now we are confronted with another 
fact: That we have been negligent in 
paying our tithes and offerings to the 
Lord. How soon we forget! How easy 
it is for man to sin, even 'As the spark* 
fly upward," as King Solomon said. 
Man is prone to do evil and to forget. 
We are apt to forget the blessings we 
are in possession of, and to forget the 
Giver. When we entered into the 
Church of Christ we covenanted with 
God, the Eternal Father, that we would 
keep His commandments and serve 
Him, that we would accent of His 
truths as revealed through His Pro- 
phets, and that we would not only enter 
into the waters of baptism as humble 
children and have our sins washed 
away and covenant with the Lord to 
be His faithful children ever after, in 
spirit and in truth, but that we would 
accede to Him all He required of us 
in our temporal affairs, and to give 
unto Him a goodly portion of that 
which we possessed, in return for His 
many blessings, that we would be faith- 
ful in paying our tithes and offerings. 
But we have drifted along, year after 
year, and today we are confronted with 
the fact that we have not half paid our 
tithing, that there is not more than 
25 per cent of the people that belong to 
the Church of Christ today who are 
honest tithe payers. 

In one prominent Stake of Zion, 
where a conference was recently held, 
under the direction of President Snow, 
I heard that not more than 15 per cent 
of the members of that whole Stake 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



59 



were tithe payers. This is the condi- 
tion we are found to be in today, my 
brethren and sisters, and the Prophet 
of the Lord has said for us to repent 
of our sins and turn away from oui 
evil doings and neglect and from our 
covetousness, and to come near unto 
the Lord, with full purpose of heart, 
to serve Him and keep His command- 
ments, to "return unto the Lord," ac- 
cording to the words of the Prophet 
Malachi, "and He will return unto you." 
But if we do not return to the Lord the 
consequence will be most serious and 
disastrous to the Saints. Never in my 
life have I heard the servants of the 
Lord stand before the people and say 
in such plainness that it was time for 
us to receive the word of the Lord and 
keep His commandments more fully, 
for us to repent and turn unto Him. I 
have observed that where the people of 
the Lord have failed to hearken to this 
word and to repent of their backsliding 
and to turn unto the Lord with full 
purpose of heart, the judgments of the 
Lord have come upon them, in every in- 
stance. Now, it is time for us to lis- 
ten and hearken to the words of the 
Lord, delivered unto us by His Prophet, 
In regard to the payment of our tith- 
ing. 

In the northern part of this State, in 
the Malad valley, we have an Indian 
colony. It is the best Indian colony, 
I think, upon the face of the earth to- 
day. It is the largest colony that I 
know anything about that is under the 
direction of the Church of Christ, num- 
bering about 250 people, organized un- 
der a Bishop, who presides over them 
as any other Bishop would over the 
white people. They have their Sunday 
school and Mutual Improvement or- 
ganizations, etc., and they go to their 
meetings regularly and attend to their 
duties very well indeed for a people 
taken from such a low condition, who 
were so ignorant in the beginning. 
They are making strides in improve- 
ment. A few years ago they began to 
farm their land, which they had home- 
steaded, under the direction of the 
Bishop and those who presided over 
them. They now possess and live up- 
on their own lands and work it as the 
white man does. They sow their own 
grain and harvest and thresh it the 



same as the white man, owning their 
threshing machines and harvesting im- 
plements. They sell their grain and 
lucern seed when threshed, and squan- 
der the proceeds, because their white 
brothers set them bad examples. 

If these Indians would save and store 
up their grain, not wasting or 
squandering it, they would be much 
better off. But their Bishop has warn- 
ed, instructed and counseled them with 
regard to this, and now they are suffer- 
ing for their disobedience in not listen- 
ing to the counsel of those placed in 
authority over them. Last year they 
had an abundance of grain and lucern, 
and they sold it all for whatever price 
they could get. But this year has been 
one of disaster to them. Their harvests 
utterly failed this year, through drouth. 
They lost all their fall wheat and 
lucern seed through early and late 
frosts and the lack of moisture, and 
now they are almost without the means 
of sustaining the colony until another 
harvest. But they are a resolute and 
patient people, and when their crops 
fail them, as at the present time, they 
go out upon the plains and into the 
mountains and hunt for a living, kill- 
ing deer and dressing their skins and 
making gloves and moccasins to take 
to the towns and cities to sell to the 
white people. They also gather wool 
from the sage-bush and other vegeta- 
tion, where it has been deposited by the 
sheep in traveling through the coun- 
try, to and from their winter and sum- 
mer ranges. By this means they man- 
age to eke out an existence and save 
themselves from starvation, when their 
crops fail. They are patient under 
these terrible ordeals, and I sometimes 
think they are more patient than their 
white brethren would be. Bishop 
Moroni Ward presides over the colony. 
A man more fitted for the position 
could probably not be found in Israel. 
He is a father to his people, and a bles- 
sing to them. A delegation of their 
chief men waited upon him not long 
ago. They said, "We have lost all our 
crops. We have no wheat or lucern 
seed, or means of gaining food and the 
necessaries of life, because the soil has 
not yielded anything for us. Now what 
is the reason?" "Well, brethren," the 
Bishop said, "have you prayed in your 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



families mornings and evenings?" 
"No." "Did you attend fast meetings 
on fast days and bring something for 
the poor?" "No." "Have any of you 
drunk a little whiskey during the past 
year and wasted your money in drink?" 
"Yes." "Have you smoked tobacco and 
wasted your money in procuring this 
poisonous weed?" "Yes." "What have 
you not done then?" They acknow- 
ledged that they had done many things 
they ought not to have done. "Then," 
said the Bishop, "can you expect the 
Lord to do all for you when you do 
nothing for yourselves?" So they went 
away satisfied, vowing within them- 
selves, no doubt, as they frequently do, 
to do better. They promised the Bishop 
that they would try to reform and do 
better, that they would try to keep the 
commandments of the Lord and sustain 
and uphold him as their Bishop, and 
to hearken to the words of counsel 
given to them. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice to- 
day that there is a man of God stand- 
ing at the head of this people. I bear 
witness to you that President Snow is 
a chosen servant of the Lord, for the 
will of the Lord is again made known 
through him, and the Lord has called 
upon us, through him, to repent of our 
sins, our backsliding and neglect, and 
to pay an honest tithing from this time 
henceforth and forever, that we may 
be indeed the people of God, and that 
this land may be a land of Zion unto 
us and unto our children, to the last 
generation of time. For, let me assure 
you, my brethren and sisters, that if 
an honest tithing was paid from all the 
forty thousand families of the Latter- 
day Saints, as they exist today in their 
prosperous condition, in all this western 
land, a very large amount would come 
into the treasury of the Lord's store- 
house each year, and we would soon be 
the wealthiest people on the face of the 
earth. I say this would have been tht 
condition had the Saints all been pay- 
ing an honest tithing. But the past 
shall be the past, the Lord has declared, 
and our sins in this matter, of the past, 
will be forgiven, provided we will begin 
from this time to be faithful servants 
and handmaidens of the Lord. That we 
may redeem ourselves from the fall and 
from our own sins. For I declare unto 



you today that the Lord has living Pro- 
phets and Apostles, and His words are 
given to us all the day long. Let us 
profit by them. 

I pray that the Lord will bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, and enable 
you to live according to the glorious 
principles of the Gospel as revealed to 
us of the Lord through His Prophets, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Emma Ramsay sang the song, 
"Come all Ye Sons of Zion," chorus by 
the choir. 

The congregation then unanimously 
sustained, by vote, all the general 
authorities of the Church, and of vari- 
ous organizations thereof as their 
names were presented by Elder Mat- 
thias F. Cowley. 

ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

Brethren and sisters, in arising to 
address you for a few minutes, I trust 
that I may ,be guided by the Spirit of 
the Lord, that I may be led to say 
something that will benefit the Latter- 
day Saints who are here present and 
build us up in our faith. 

I will read the 21st verse of the 14th 
chapter of the Gospel according to St. 
John: 

"He that hath my commandments, 
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth 
me; and he that loveth me shall be 
loved of my Father, and I will love him, 
and will manifest myself to him." 

This promise holds good in our day 
and time, although it was uttered many 
centuries ago. Still, we profess to have 
the same authority as the disciples of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and the same 
Gospel as preached by them, even the 
power of God unto salvation. This be- 
ing the case, there is no Latter-day 
Saint, no matter what degree of Priest- 
hood he may hold, no matter what his 
standing may be, if he be in the Church 
of Christ and is faithful and keeps the 
commandments of the Lord, but what 
has this promise vouchsafed unto him: 
That the Father will manifest Himsett 
to him; and this can be done in a very 
great variety of ways. 

I believe that there is no Latter-day 
Saint, that has any interest in the 
Church of Christ, but what has been 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 



61 



led to marvel at the peculiar workings 
of destiny in connection with the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as a people. There is 
no one that has been an observer of 
the history of this people that can help 
but acknowledge that there is some- 
thing supernatural or superhuman con- 
nected with the development of the lat- 
ter-day work. In every instance where 
the people have observed certain com- 
mandments given to them, they have 
always received the promises connected 
therewith, and where they have not 
kept those commandments, God has 
poured out His judgments upon them 
for their disobedience. Every Latter- 
day Saint should be interested in the 
work of the Lord and seek to obtain for 
himself or herself a testimony concern- 
ing this work, for the evidences of its 
divinity are so abundant that if we 
strive to any degree at all to know of 
the truthfulness of this great latter-day 
work, we may know whether or not it 
is of God or of man. Sometimes we 
may ask ourselves the question, Is 
Lorenzo Snow a Prophet of the Living 
God? Is he the mouthpiece of God 
upon the earth? Do we believe it? Do 
we believe that he is authorized to say 
"Thus sayeth the Lord?" I believe and 
know that he is and that he possesses 
all the authority necessary to consti- 
tute him the mouthpiece of the Lord 
upon the earth. If we believe this we 
will be very anxious to follow his teach- 
ings, and we will be very anxious to 
be connected with the Church of Jesus 
Christ, that we may know and that 
God the Eternal Father may know 
which master we list to obey, for we 
have been told that his servants are 
we whom we list to obey. If we list to 
obey God the Eternal Father we will be 
His servants, and we will be desirous 
for the establishment of the work of 
the Lord upon the earth and to see it 
grow and increase, and we will love 
righteousness and hate iniquity. 

As Latter-day Saints, I feel that we 
ought to stand closely together in this 
day and time when it appears as 
though persecution would again be 
waged against us. It is a warning to 
us to stand more closely together. We 
ought to be a people who believe in 
supporting one another and the king- 



dom of God. We ought not, as we have 
done in the past in many instances, 
furnish the gold and silver to forge the 
instruments that are aimed at our lives, 
the lives of this people, as a com- 
munity. Very often we have, through 
our patronage and support, built up 
men and institutions that have after- 
wards used every means in sending ou1 
falsehoods regarding this people, and 
that have done everything they could 
to bring persecution upon the Saints. I 
feel this is wrong, that we ought not to 
do it. I think that the Latter-day 
Saints, as a rule, do not fully compre- 
hend . what they are doing in this re- 
gard. It is true that we desire to do 
business with all honorable men. But 
I want to say to the Latter-day Saints 
that if this people would withdraw their 
support from those men, institutions 
and agencies, and from those papery 
that send out falsehoods about this peo- 
ple and the citizens of this state, they 
would not be able to live. It is the 
support which the Latter-day Saints 
give these agencies that maintains 
them. Therefore, I say that we feed 
the instruments that are intended to 
be used against us, and that are used 
against us. I think we should reflect 
more upon these things. In many of 
our settlements the Saints have given 
their patronage and support to men 
who have come into their midst and 
fleeced them, and who have then turned 
around and used those very means 
against them. This should be a warn- 
ing to the Latter-day Saints that they 
ought to try and support themselves 
and their own institutions, to build up 
one another and be more united in the 
future than they have been in the 
past. 

I feel anxiously engaged in the work 
of the Lord. I desire above all things 
upon the face of the earth to enjoy the 
spirit of the Apostleship of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, that I might labor for 
the bringing about of the salvation of 
the sons and daughters of God upon the 
face of the earth. This is the work of 
God, the Eternal Father. It is not the 
work of man, and we do not need to be 
very much concerned with regard to 
the outcome of this people. We need 
not be agitated on account of the efforts 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



being made for their overthrow. If we 
do our duty as individuals the Lord will 
take care of the rest. We have had no 
occasion in the past to worry regard- 
ing the final outcome of this com- 
munity. The Lord has always brought 
to naught the plans that have been laid 
and devised for the destruction of this 
people by our enemies, and He will do 
the same in the future, if we will hold 
together and not allow ourselves to be 
led off and to mix up too much with 
our enemies. Of course, we welcome all 
good citizens. "We love all good citizens 
in this city and state and upon the 
face of the earth, who delight in telling 
the truth, but we have not yet learned 
to love those that tell falsehoods and 
that seek to destroy our influence in the 
nation. I suppose we ought to love 
them, according to the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, but we have not per- 
fected ourselves to that degree yet. 

I pray God to bless you and to teach 
us and fill us with His Holy Spirit con- 
tinually, that we may so live, by keep- 
ing the commandments of God, the 
Eternal Father, that we may ever know 
for ourselves, whenever anything is en- 
acted for the Church as a whole, 
whether it is of the Lord or not, and 
not set up our own ideas against the 
plans of the Lord. It is the right of 
every Latter-day Saint, who is living in 
accordance to the commandments of 
the Lord, to know of the truthfulness, 
correctness and righteousness of every 
enactment that is made by the Church 
of Christ, for we believe in revelation. 
We believe that God will manifest these 
things unto us, not simply to those who 
etand at the head of the Church, but 
to all the members of the Church of 
Christ. It is our privilege to know and 
understand whether anything that is 
done by the Church is right or not, if 
we are living in accordance with the 
commandments of the Lord. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, and may 
He fill our hearts with His peace. May 
we realize more in the future than we 
have ever done in the past the neces- 
sity of laboring continually for the es- 
tablishment of righteousness and the 
building up of God's kingdom and work 
upon the face of the earth. May we so 
live that we may share in the blessings 
which God the Eternal Father has 



promised to those that love Him and 
keep His commandments. I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

My brethren and sisters, I hope you 
will not get weary, and that you will 
sustain me by your faith and prayers 
while I occupy a few minutes of the 
time. I would also like for you to sus- 
tain me by your faith and prayers every 
day in the future, and in return I will 
endeavor to sustain you by my faith 
and prayers and by such exertion as 
the gifts and blessings of the Almighty 
to me shall enable me to be of benefit 
and profit to the Latter-day Saints. 

It is of very little use to bear testi- 
mony that we know that the Gospel is 
true unless we exemplifiy that testi- 
mony in our daily walk and conversa- 
tion. The best evidence which we can 
g-ive to the Lord that we are convinced 
that President Snow is a Prophet of 
God is that we shall heed the coun- 
sel which has been given through him 
to this people, and pay our tithing, thus 
testifying by our works that we do sus- 
tain President Lorenzo Snow as the 
mouthpiece of God to the Latter-day 
Saints. 

There is a statement in the Doctrine 
and Covenants having a bearing upon 
those who are sent out to preach the 
Gospel, and it applies to those who 
preach the Gospel at home, not only as 
missionaries bearing offices as general 
authorities of the Church, but it applies 
to every Bishop and Elder in Israel, 
and to the Seventies and Presidents of 
Seventies, to the lesser Priesthood and 
all who administer in the various of- 
fices assigned unto them. It is this: 
"Treasure up in your minds continu- 
ally the words of life, and it shall be 
given you in the very hour that por- 
tion that shall be meted unto every 
man." It is not for the purpose of 
dwelling upon this quotation that I 
read it, but to call your attention to 
another matter: It is the duty of the 
servants and handmaidens of the Lord, 
who constitute the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, to treas- 
ure up the words of eternal life, and 
then, under the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty administer that portion of the 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRbFF. 



63 



word of God that is especially adapted 
to the wants of the people on the occa- 
sion, it is also the duty of every Lat- 
ter-day Saint to know what is the mat- 
ter with himself or herself and to know 
exactly wherein they have come short 
in keeping- and observing- the command- 
ments of God. I will venture to say 
that the instructions of this conference 
are applicable, to a greater or less de- 
gree, to every individual, male or fe- 
male, who has been in attendance at 
this conference. It is the duty of the 
Latter-day Saints to take to themselves 
that portion of the word of God which 
is- applicable unto them, or which they 
have not fully exemplified by their con- 
duct and lives heretofore, and make a 
distinct and personal application of the 
tame to themselves in the future. If 
there is any one here who has exempli- 
fied these instructions fully, who has 
not been derelict in his or her duty, 
having fulfilled it to- the fullest ex- 
tent, taking into consideration every in- 
junction of the Gospel and every re- 
quirement of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, please hold up 
your right hand. I would like to see 
you. And I presume we are all a little 
derelict and that there is a necessity 
for a reformation upon our part. 

It is certainly unnecessary for us to 
rehearse this afternoon the promises 
extended to those that are faithful, un- 
to those who are diligent in keeping the 
commandments of God, and the great 
disadvantages and the disapproval of 
Heaven if we keep not the command- 
ments of the Lord. We must remember 
that we have taken upon us the most 
solemn obligations that were ever as- 
sumed by men and women upon the 
face of the earth. This is the great and 
last dispensation, a dispensation in 
which is comprehended all the keys, 
blessings and powers and every meas- 
ure of divine authority which has been 
enjoyed by any and all previous dis- 
pensations of the Gospel, from father 
Adam down to the present period of 
time. Upon our shoulders rest the re- 
sponsibilities of all these dispensations 
combined together, as it were. It is 
the dispensation of the fullness of 
times. We have made sacred coven- 
ants, in sacred places, and those coven- 
ants mean something. When the Lord 
revealed them through His servant, the 



Prophet Joseph, as applying to this dis- 
pensation, it was designed that they 
should be attended, when strictly ob- 
served, by the blessings and power of 
Almighty God, and it was designed that 
if those sacred covenants should be 
violated and trampled in the dust of 
the earth, God would not be mocked, 
and that His judgments would come 
upon His people unless they exemplified 
the principles of the Gospel in their 
daily walk and conversation. Now, 
these things, my brethren and sisters, 
have been brought to the attention of 
the Latter-day Saints, in the instruc- 
tions of this general conference. Let 
us reflect upon them. Let every man 
and woman ask himself or herself the 
question, Where have I been derelict? 
In what duty have I been neglectful? 
Can I improve? And then let us con- 
sider the instructions given at this con- 
ference, and especially that portion 
that would be applicable to us indi- 
vidually. Let us go forth from this 
time and pay our tithes and offerings, 
and consecrate as much of our pro- 
perty to the cause of God, to the liqui- 
dating of the debts and obligations of 
this Church, as is possible for us. I 
say to you that it is the easiest way to 
secure the blessings and protection of 
Almighty God. The Prophet of the 
Lord has said to us more than once, 
since he received the manifestation in 
the city of St. George, that the Latter- 
day Saints must pay their tithing or 
they shall not be entitled to the bles- 
sings of the house of the Lord, and 
shall be subject to the persecution and 
tyranny of their enemies. He has also 
said to us more than once that if we 
would pay our tithing as we should the 
Lord would bless us abundantly, 
spiritually and temporally. I would 
not have you pay your tithing for a 
selfish motive. I would not desire to 
pay my own tithing with the idea in 
view that the Lord would enrich me in 
a temporal capacity. The riches of this 
earth are not the choicest the Lord has 
to bestow. He may bestow them upon 
us, and they are necessary for the pro- 
motion of the work of God, in a ma- 
terial sense, but the choicest blessing 
that comes to the Latter-day Saints is 
the rich and choice inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, to enlighten our minds up- 
on the things of God and to give us an 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Influence among the children of men 
that will enable us to verify the injunc- 
tion of the Savior when He said, "Let 
your light so shine before men, that 
they may see your good works, and 
glorify your Father which is in 
Heaven." These are the choicest bles- 
sings, my brethren and sisters. 

Let me encourage you to make a 
more earnest effort to enlist your young 
people in the work of Mutual Improve- 
ment and Sabbath School work, and 
to get them to take advantage of the 
opportunities that are afforded them in 
the Gospel, that our sons and daughters 
may be efficient in proclaiming the 
Gospel, both at home and abroad. 
There is a great necessity for this. 

I must not occupy your time much 
longer. It is nearly up. May the Lord 
bless you, my brethren and sisters, and 
may we go forth from this conference, 
to the various Stakes of Zion where 
v e reside, and to our various labors, 
and to the nations of the earth, with 
the spirit of this conference, dissemi- 
nating it among the people of God and 
among the peoples of this earth. 

I bear to you my testimony that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the 
living God. I bear testimony to you 
that the Father, the Almighty, and His 
Son, Jesus Christ, presented themselves 
to that boy Prophet in this dispensa- 
tion. I bear to you my testimony that 
he received the keys of the gathering 
of the house of Israel, from the hands 
of the Prophet Moses, that he received 
the keys for the building of temples 
and the redemption of the dead, from 
the Prophet Elijah, who appeared per- 
sonally to him and restored those keys. 
I bear testimony to you that the great 
Prince Michael, the Archangel, has de- 
livered to him the keys connecting, by 
genealogy, the generations of men, and 
binding them together in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, from the beginning down 
to the latest period of time, in this dis- 
pensation. These keys have been re- 
stored to the earth. I rejoice in the 
Gospel. I am under obligations to the 
Almighty, and I feel my obligations to 
Him. God has always given me some- 
thing to do and has opened up the way 
before me and shown me what my 
calling was. I want to say to the young 
men in Israel, if you are laboring in 
any doubt as to what you should do in 



life, go to God in prayer and ask Him 
what you should do, and let Him guide 
you by His Spirit, and He will do it. 
We are the people of God, and He has 
promised to hear and answer our pray- 
ers. I want to admonish you to resnp*»*. 
the principles of the everlasting Gospel, 
no matter what they are, no matter if 
they be the principles that are as- 
saulted by our enemies. They are the 
principles of eternal truth, and God has 
revealed and established them upon 
the earth, and He will maintain them, 
and Zion will be established, and the 
kingdom of God will grow in power, 
and the Latter-day Saints will be pre- 
pared for the coming of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and His reign upon the earth. 

These are my testimonies. May God 
bless you, is my prayer, In the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

There is one subject to which I wish 
to briefly refer. I wish to call your at- 
tention to your temple work. This is 
a very important consideration, or 
should be, in our lives and in our home 
affairs. Let us contemplate it. Thous- 
ands, and I might say millions, of dol- 
lars have been expended by this people, 
through the commandments of the 
Lord, in building temples. We have 
four in this State. They are convenient 
to a great majority of the people of the 
Church, not only in this State, but in 
the surrounding States. Now, we must 
all remember, that a hundred years 
hence, in all probability, every one of 
us will be on the other side of the veil, 
and we have kindred there, fathers and 
mothers, grand-fathers and grand- 
mothers, and great grand-fathers and 
great grand-mothers. A great many 
of our kindred have left this existence, 
any many of them without a knowledge 
of the Gospel, perhaps the majority of 
them. We are here as their children, 
and they have an interest in us and we 
have an interest in them, because the 
keys have been revealed whereby the 
hearts of the children are turned to 
the fathers, and the hearts of the 
fathers to the children. Those keys 
and powers have been revealed in our 
day and time, and we now have op- 
portunities, while in life, to prosecute 



GENERAL AUTHORITIES. 



63 



this labor in their behalf and to ex- 
tend to our kindred beyond the veil the 
greatest redeeming- plan of salvation. 
The opportunity is now afforded us. 
Opportunities are also continually open- 
ing before us, whereby our genealo- 
gies may be obtained. I have learn- 
ed, through experience, that people who 
have an interest in their temple work, 
records and genealogies, obtain those 
genealogical records, to a great extent. 
Some people spend hundreds of dollars, 
perhaps thousands of dollars, in trav- 
eling and gathering up the records of 
their forefathers, while others are in- 
different in this regard, and scarcely 
think of it from one year's end to an- 
other. We are not going to live for- 
ever, none of us. We may pass away 
any moment. I have known of many 
instances of this kind, where people 
have put off from time to time and from 
year to year, their work in behalf of 
some of their kindred dead, and have 
finally passed away themselves without 
doing this work. I know of such cases 
in Salt Lake City and all over the 
country. Now, brethren and sisters, do 
not forget this labor. Do not put it off 
until you are entirely ready, because, if 
you do, perhaps you will not get ready 
at all. Your way may be hedged up, for 
Satan is on the move and is looking into 
our affairs continually and he may 
hedge up our way, wherever the oppor- 
tunity is afforded him, that we shall not 
be able to redeem our kindred dead. 
Therefore, I wish to urge this matter 
upon you. Tn the midst of all our duties 
and labor, let us not forget our fathers 
and mothers, and our kindred on the 
other side of the veil. 

God bless you, and may He lead us in 
the paths of life; that our minds may 
be stirred up by way of remembrance of 
the duties pertaining to us in this our 
second estate. 

The meeting was brought to a close 
by the singing of the hymn, "We thank 
Thee, O God for a Prophet." 

Benediction by Elder Marriner W. 
Merrill.

"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works." 

Prayer by Elder Angus M. Cannon. 
Singing by the choir: 

O, my Father, thou that dwellest, 

In the high and glorious place, 
When shall I regain thy presence, 

And again behold thy face? 
In thy holy habitation, 

Did my spirit once reside? 
In my first primeval childhood, 

Was I natured near thy side?

Brother Horace S. Ensign riang the

ELDER JOSEPH W. M'MURRIN. 

Young Men should be Prepared for the Minittiy— 
Usefulness of Musical Ability. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, in 
standing before this great assembly 
of people that I occupy a very respon- 
sible position. The words spoken by 
Apostle Merrill come home to me with 
considerable force, that when one 
stands up to claim the attention of so 
many people, he certainly needs the in- 
spiration of the Holy Spirit that the 
time may be spent profitably. The time 
of the people should not be wasted 
through men speaking by their own 
wisdom and without the inspiration of 
the Lord. I sincerely pray that that 
spirit may direct me in the few words 
that I speak, and that I may have the 
sympathy and the faith and prayers of 
this great congregation of Latter-day 
Saints. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
meetings of this conference and in the 
glorious instructions that have been 
given by the serva.nts of the Lord, as 
they have been moved upon by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. I thank the 
Lord that in my heart there is a re- 
sponse to the teachings that have been 
given by the various speakers, and 
that I feel in my soul that I am in full 
accord with, the doctrines that have 
been announced; that I sustain them, 
and that I can bear testimony to their 
truth and to their great value to this 
people. I feel that there could have 
been no man or woman attend the as- 
semblies of this conference without 
feeling that he or she has received in- 
structions from the Lord, and has come 
away with a determination to improve 
in the future with the assistance of 
God. I know my own heart has had 
feelings of this nature. I have felt 
that I would endeavor to do better, 
that I would pay attention to the hints 
that have been thrown out and to the 
doctrines that have been given and try 
to keep the commandments of the Lord 
more fully. There is a splendid op- 
portunity for all Latter-day Saints to 
accomplish a great amount of good. 
We heard here this morning and we all 



understand it, that the responsibility 
of preaching this glorious Gospel, 
which has been revealed by our Father 
in Heaven, rests upon this people, par- 
ticularly upon those who bear the 
authority of the Holy Priesthood. 
When we think of the vast field that 
opens up before us, of the millions of 
people who know nothing concerning 
the glad news that God has sent to His 
children on the earth, we should be 
anxious to qualify ourselves for these 
duties and responsibilities. 

I feel that greater attention should 
be • iven 10 the young men who are 
growing up in our midst. There 
should be greater anxiety upon the 
part of fathers and mothers and of 
men who are in authority, to train 
them u the principles of the Gospel, 
that when they leave their homes and 
go out into the world to preach the 
Gospil, they may be qualified for that 
labor, thai none of them may be in the 
condition of some who have declared 
that they never studied the Gospel, 
that they did not know where to And 
certain books of the Holy Scriptures, 
and thai they had never prayed public 
ly in their lives, not even in the family 
circle. I rejoice that there are oppor- 
tunities abounding on every hand, if 
the people will take advantage of them 
to educate their sons and daughters 
in the principles of the Gospel and to 
prepare them for this serious responsi- 
bil'ty thiii must come upon them in the 
future. We have many schools organ- 
ized that are under the control of the 
LaLier-day Saints, where the princi- 
ples that are so dear to us are taught 
to the studerts. I feel that all the 
people should give encouragement to 
ther-o worthy institutions. They should 
send their sons and daughters to be 
educated under the influence of the 
Gospel, that they may grow up with 
an understanding of its principles and 
be capable of defending them when 
they go out among the people. I be- 
lieve that in one particular we could 
make very great improvement, and 
that is in a musical way. As I listened 
to the solo that was rendered here this 
afternoon by Elder Ensign, who has 
recently returned from missionary la- 
bor, 1 felt in my heart that the power 
and ability that he has in this direc-

Lion has been as of great worth to him 
in th^ r. eaching of the Gospel as a 
knowledge of the scriptures. If great- 
er attention were given to this subject 
of ih* iva,ning of young L nen and of 
yriing women also, how to sing the 
tongs L i Zion, it would be i;f gr«at 
worth to the missions to which they go. 
I think that if Mission Presidents who 
are in this congregation were asked, 
they would bear testimony that ihey 
would rather have men sent into lhe:v 
mi.*sior.s Avho could sing well and who 
could ti ach ethers to sing, even though 
they could not preach at all. 
This has been my experience in the 
European Mission, particularly in 
Great Britain. The young men who 
could sing the songs of Zion in a prop- 
er and pleasing manner were always in 
demand. They carried an influence with 
them that made them welcome at the 
homes of the people. They attracted 
attention upon the streets and they 
found good congregations to preach to, 
and th» y v. ere able to do a great deal 
more good through being able to sing 
well than they otherwise would have 
done. Wonderful things can be ac- 
complished in this direction. Prof. 
Stephens, I believe, at times has had 
thousands of students under his direc- 
tion, training the youth of this Stake 
of Zion particularly, to sing the songs 
of Zion. Other musical directors could 
follow this example. They should per- 
suade young men to join their choirs, 
to form glee clubs, and to prepare 
themselVes in this way to make a good, 
impression on the people when they go 
out to preach the Gospel. 

I do not feel, my brethren and sis- 
ters, that it would be proper for me to 
occupy more of your time; but I do re- 
joice in this Gospel. I thank God with 
all my heart that I have been born 
and reared in the midst of the Latter- 
day Saints. I testify before you that 
this work is of God; that there is 
power and salvation within it; that it 
has been revealed by the God of Heav- 
en for the benefit and blessing of the 
people. I pray God that we may be 
stirred up as a people; that we may 
believe that there is a Prophet in the 
midst of Israel and that the God of 
Heaven has spoken to him and has 
commanded him to warn this people of 
the error of their ways and to point 



out to them the way in which they 
should walk, that they may be blessed 
of the Lord. Let us receive the coun- 
sel given; let us believe the word of 
the Lord; let us sustain His servants, 
and let us awake to the responsibilities 
that rest upon us and follow in that 
straight path that will bring us ever- 
lasting life. May God bless us and 
help us to live aright all the days of 
our lives, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

the Means of Escape fioin It — Young Men 
should Preserve Themselves in Purity. 

Greatly to my surprise, I have been 
requested to occupy a few moments. 
I need not repeat the petition of my 
brother who has just sat down, that I 
may have the sympathy and the pray- 
ers of the Saints, for I certainly desire 
and need them. A certain incident was 
brought forcibly to my mind while 
Brother MoMurrin was talking to us. 
Not long ago President Snow and his 
party attended a Stake conference, and 
I noticed that the choir was made up 
almost entirely of young ladies. There 
were perhaps two young men. One 
young man led the choir, and I do not 
remember clearly whether there was 
one young man in the choir or not be- 
sides the leader; but all the rest were 
young ladies. It was a beautiful choir, 
and they sang beautifully, but the ab- 
sense of male voices was very con- 
spicuous, notwithstanding. I believe 
during one of the services the leader of 
the choir was absent, and one of the 
young ladies had to step forward and 
lead it. I inquired why it was that the 
young men were not more numerous 
in that company of singers, and was 
told that the young men considered it 
was too effeminate, too womanly, for 
them to engage in the occupation of 
singing. I presume they might have 
felt more at home shaking the quilts, 
sweeping the floors, and helping to 
wash the dishes. I can remember when 
I was a little boy, hearing my father 
sing. I do not know how much of a 
singer he was, for at that time I was 
not capable of judging as to the qual- 
ity of his singing, but the hymns he

6ang became familiar to me, even in 
the days of my childhood. I believe 
that I can sing them still, although I 
am not much of a singer. When young 
men go out into the world to preach 
the Gospel, they will find it very bene- 
ficial for them to know how to sing 
the songs of Zion. I repeat the ad- 
monition and request made by Brother 
McMurrin, who has recently returned 
from a lengthy mission to Europe, that 
the young men who are eligible to 
preach the Gospel, and who are liable 
to be called into the missionary field, 
begin at once to improve their talent 
to sing, and do not think it is beneath 
their dignity to join the choirs of the 
wards in which they live and learn how 
to sing. When we listen to this choir, 
under the leadership of Brother Ste- 
phens, we listen to music, and music is 
truth. Good music is gracious praise 
of God. It is delightsome to the ear, 
and it is one of our most acceptable 
methods of worshipping God. And those 
who sing in this choir and in all the 
choirs of the Saints, should sing with 
the spirit and with the understanding. 
They should not sing merely because 
it is a profession, or because they have 
a good voice; but they should sing also 
because they have the spirit of it and 
can enter into the spirit of prayer and 
praise to God who gave them their 
sweet voices. My soul is always lifted 
up and my spirit cheered and com- 
forted when I hear good music. I re- 
joice in it very much indeed. Now, I 
would like to encourage the young men 
of Israel to learn to sing, and especially 
those young men of whom I have been 
speaking. I would not like to tell you 
just where they live, because it might 
be considered a little personal, but it 
was down south; it was not very far 
down south either. It was somewhere 
near Sanpete valley. I want the young 
men of Sanpete Valley to learn how to 
sing, so that when we go down to hold 
conference there again we can have the 
young men joining with the young wo- 
men in the choir, and not leave the 
young women to do all the singing. 
This might apply also to all the other 
counties; especially should it apply to 
those counties or Stakes of Zion where 
the young men think it is beneath their 
dignity and their manhood to learn 



how to sing. I hope they will rise 
above such a foolish notion as this. 

Not only should we learn to sing, 
but we should learn to say our prayers. 
It is about as awkward for a young 
man to go out to preach the Gospel to 
those who sit in darkness, who does 
not know how to pray, as it is for one 
who does not know how to sing. And 
there are some who have gone out in- 
to the world, as we have heard today, 
who have not even known how to pray. 
The last time I was absent from home 
in the missionary field, I heard of a 
young man, whose grandfather was an 
Apostle and one of the most brilliant 
and faithful Apostles of the Church, 
and whose father has been a Bishop in 
the Church, and is today a very prom- 
einent man. This young man went out 
to preach the Gospel to the heathens, 
and when he got into the field of labor 
he confessed he had never said a 
prayer in his life; he had never heard 
his mother pray; he had not been suffi- 
ce ntly with his father to hear him 
pray, and he knew nothing about pray- 
ing and he had to begin as a little 
child, in the missionary field, to learn 
how to pray. It is a great pity that a 
young man should be sent out handi- 
capped in this way; that he should be 
put to such a disadvantage by the in- 
difference of his parents and the neg- 
lect of tho opportunities that he had 
had in Zion. I pray you, my young 
brethren who are present in this vast 
congregation, and who are liable to be 
called to preach the Gospel to the 
world, when you are called to go out, 
I pray that you will know how to ap- 
proach God in prayer. It is not such 
a difficult thing to learn how to pray. 
It is not the words we use particularly 
that constitute prayer. Prayer does 
not consist of words, altogether. True, 
faithful, earnest prayer consists more 
in the feeling that rises from the heart 
and from the inward desire of our 
spirits to supplicate the Lord in hu- 
mility and in faith, that we may re- 
ceive His blessings. It matters not 
how simple the words may be, if our 
desires are genuine and we come be- 
fore the Lord with a broken heart and 
a contrite spirit to ask Him for that 
which we need. I would like to know 
if there is a young man in this congre- 



70

gation, or anywhere else, who does not 
need something of the Lord. Where 
is there a soul upon the earth that does 
not need something' that the Almighty 
can give. In the first place, all that 
we have comes from him. It is by His 
providence that we exist on the earth. 
It is by His kind mercy that we see 
and hear, that we have the power of 
speech, and that we possess intelli- 
gence, for as the prophet of old said, 
"There is a spirit in man, and the in- 
spiration of the Almighty giveth them 
understanding." Therefore the very 
power of understanding that we possess 
is the gift of God. In and of ourselves 
we are but a lifeless lump of cla^\ 
Life, intelligence, wisdom, judgment, 
power to reason, all are the gifts of 
God to the children of men. He gives 
us our physical strength as well as our 
mental powers. Every young man 
should feel from the depth of his heart 
that he is indebted to Almighty God for 
his being and for every attribute that 
he possesses which is in likeness of the 
attributes of God. We should seek to 
magnify the attributes that we possess. 
We should honor God with our intelli- 
gence, with our strength, with our 
understanding, with our wisdom, and 
with all the power that we possess. We 
should seek to do good in the world. 
This is our duty; and if a young man 
can only feel as all men should feel, 
he will find that it is an easy matter 
for him to bow down before the Lord 
in humble prayer and seek unto him 
for the aid, comfort, and inspiration 
of His Holy Spirit, that he may not 
be left entirely to himself, nor to the 
wisdom and ways of the world. But as 
a rule, where young men have good 
parents to provide for them, where 
they have good homes and their food 
and raiment are sure, they feel that 
they are not dependent upon anybody, 
unless perchance they should be afflict- 
ed in some way, and then begin to real- 
ize their weakness and dependence. 
But I want to say to you, my young 
friends, that in the hour of your in- 
dependence, at the moment when you 
feel the strongest, you should bear in 
mind that you are but human, the 
breath of life is in your nostrils, and 
you are destined to pass from this 
world through the portals of death. 



Every man that is born into the world 
will die. It matters not who he is, 
nor where he is, whether his birth be 
among the rich and the noble, or 
among the lowly and poor in the world, 
his days are numbered with the Lord, 
and in due time he will reach the end. 
We should think of this. Not that we 
should go about with heavy hearts or 
with downcast countenances; not at all. 
I rejoice that I am born to live, to die, 
and to live again. I thank God for 
this intelligence. It gives me joy and 
peace that the world cannot give, 
neither can the world take it away. 
God has revealed this to me, in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. I know it to 
be true. Therefore I have nothing to 
be sad over, nothing to make me sor- 
rowful. All that I have to do with 
in the world is calculated to buoy me 
up, to give me joy and peace, hope 
and consolation in this present life, 
and a glorious hope of salvation and 
exaltation in the presence of my God 
in the world to come. I have no rea- 
son to mourn, not even at death. It is 
true I am weak enough to weep at 
the death of my friends and kindred. 
I may shed tears when I see the grief 
of others. I have sympathy in my soul 
for the children of men. I can weep 
with them when they weep; I cant re- 
joice with them when they rejoice; but 
I have no cause to mourn, nor to be 
sad because death comes into the 
world. I am speaking now of the tem- 
poral death, the death of the body. All 
fear of. this death has been removed 
from the Latter-day Saints. .They have 
no dread of the temporal death, be- 
cause they know that as death came 
upon them by the transgression of 
Adam, so by the righteousness of Jesus 
Christ shall life come unto them, and 
though they die they shall live again. 
Possessing this knowledge, they have 
joy even in death, for they know that 
they shall rise again and shall meet 
again beyond the grave. They know 
that the spirit dies not at all; that it 
passes through no change, except the 
change from imprisonment in this mor- 
tal clay to freedom and to the sphere 
in which it acted before it came to 
this earth. We are begotten in the 
similitude of Christ himself. We dwelt 
with the Father and with the Son In

the beginning, as the sons and daugh- 
ters of God, and at the time appointed 
we came to this earth to take uoon 
ourselves tabernacles, that we might 
become conformed to the likeness and 
image of Jesus Christ and become like 
him; that we might have a tabernacle 
as He has a tabernacle; that we might 
pass through death as He has passed 
through death; that we might rise 
again from the dead as He has risen 
from the dead. As He was the first 
fruits of the resurrection of the dead, 
so shall we be the second fruits of the 
resurrection from the dead; for as He 
came forth, so shall we come forth. 
What is there therefore to be sad 
about? What is there to make us 
heavy of heart or sorrowful in this 
matter? Nothing at all. Sorrowful, in- 
deed, to think that we shall live for- 
ever! Is there any cause for sorrow 
to know that we shall rise from the 
dead, and possess the same tabernacle 
that we have here in mortality? Is 
there cause for sorrow in this great, 
glorious Gospel truth that has been re- 
vealed to us in this dispensation? Cer- 
tainly there can be no sorrow connected 
with a thought like this. There must 
be only joy connected with this know- 
ledge — the joy that springs from the 
ten thousand feelings and affections of 
the human soul; the joy that we feel 
in association with brethren, with 
wives and children, with fathers and 
mothers, with brothers and sisters. All 
these joyous thoughts spring up in our 
souls at the thought of death and the 
resurrection. Wherein should we be 
sad or sorrowful? On the contrary, it 
is cause for joy unspeakable, and for 
pure happiness. I cannot express the 
joy I feel at the thought of meeting my 
father, and my precious mother, who 
gave me birth in the midst of persecu- 
tion and poverty, who bore me in her 
arms and was patient, forbearing, ten- 
der and true during all my helpless 
moments in the world. The thought of 
meeting her, who can express the joy? 
The thought of meeting my children 
who have preceded me beyond the veil, 
and of meeting my kindred and my 
friends, what happiness it affords! For 
I know that I shall meet them there. 
God has shown me that this is true. 
He has made it clear to me, in answer 



to my prayer and devotion as He 
has made it clear to the understanding 
of all men who have sought diligently 
to know of Him. We are not depen- 
dent for this upon the written word, 
nor upon the knowledge possessed by 
the ancient Prophets and Apostles. We 
depend only upon God as He reveals 
Himself today and administers unto 
men by the power of His Holy Spirit. 
And all men in the world, not only the 
Latter-day Saints, but those who have 
never embraced the Gospel, have the 
same privilege that we have, if they 
will take the course which God has 
marked out. It is their privilege to 
come to the knowledge of this truth 
and to understand these things' for 
themselves. We have derived this 
knowledge from the Lord, not from 
man. Man can not give this knowledge. 
I may tell you what I know, but that 
is not knowledge to you. If I have 
learned something through prayer, sup- 
plication, and perseverance in seeking 
to know the truth, and I tell it to you, 
it will not be knowledge unto you. I 
can tell you how you can obtain It, 
but I cannot give it to you. If we re- 
ceive this knowledge, it must come 
from the Lord. He can touch your 
understandings and your spirits, so 
that you shall comprehend perfectly 
and not be mistaken. But I cannot do 
that. You can obtain this knowledge 
through repentance, humility, and 
seeking the Lord with full purpose of 
heart until you find Him. He is not 
afar off. It is not difficult to ap- 
proach Him, if we will only do it with 
a broken heart and a contrite spirit, 
as did Nephi of old. This was the way 
in which Joseph Smith, in his boyhood, 
approached Him. He went into the 
woods, knelt down, and in humility h& 
sought earnestly to know which church 
was acceptable to God. He received 
an answer to his prayer, which he of- 
fered from the depths of his heart, and 
he received it in a way that he did not 
expeci. 

My brethren and sisters, do not learn 
to pray with your lips only. Do not 
learn a prayer by heart, and say it 
every morning and evening. That is 
something I dislike very much. It is 
true that a great many people fall into 
the rut of saying over a ceremonious 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



prayer. They begin at a certain point, 
and they touch at all the points along 
the road until they get to the winding 
up scene; and when they have done, I 
do not know whether the prayer has 
ascended beyond the ceiling of the room 
or not. I rejoice in the truth. I thank 
God for the testimony that I have re- 
ceived of the Gospel. I thank God that 
I live, and that I shall die and that I 
shall live again in spite of me. I can- 
not prevent that, I am bound to go 
through that ordeal. 

But I want to speak a word or two 
in relation to another death, which is 
a more terrible death than that of the 
body. "When Adam, our first parent, 
partook of the forbidden fruit, trans- 
gressed the law of God, and became 
subject unto Satan, he was banished 
from the presence of God and was 
thrust out into outer spiritual darkness. 
This was the first death. Tet living, he 
was dead— dead to God, dead to light 
and truth, dead spiritually; cast out 
from the presence of God; communica- 
tion between the Father and the son cut 
off. He was as absolutely thrust out 
from the presence of God as was Satan 
and the hosts that followed him. That 
was spiritual death. But the Lord said 
that He would not suffer Adam nor his 
posterity to come to the temporal death 
until they should have the means by 
which they might be redeemed from 
the first death, which is spiritual. 
Therefore angels were sent unto Adam, 
who taught him the Gospel and re- 
vealed to him the principle by which 
he could be redeemed from the first 
death, and be brought back from ban- 
ishment and outer darkness into the 
marvelous light of the Gospel. He was 
taught faith, repentance and baptism 
for the remission of sins, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, who should come in the 
meridian of time and take away the 
sin of the world, and was thus given a 
chance to be redeemed from the spirit- 
ual death before he should die the tem- 
poral death. Now, all the world today, 
I am sorry to say, with the exception of 
a handful of people who have obeyed 
the new and everlasting coverant, are 
suffering this spiritual death. They are 
cast out from the presence of God. They 
are without God, without Gospel truth, 



and without the power of redemption; 
for they know not God nor His GospeL 
In order that they may be redeemed 
and saved from the spiritual death 
which has spread over the world like 
a pall, they must repent of their sins, 
and be baptized by one having author- 
ity, for the remission of their sins, that 
they may be born of God. That is why 
we want these young men to go out in- 
to the world to preach the Gospel. 
While they themselves understand but 
little perhaps, the germ of life is in 
them. They have been born again, they 
have received the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, and they have the authority of 
the holy Priesthood, by which they can 
administer in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
Though they may know but little in the 
beginning, they can learn, and as they 
learn they can preach, and as they have 
opportunity they can baptize for the 
remission of sins. Therefore, we want 
them to do their duty at home. We 
want them above all things to be pure 
in heart. "We want our boys to be 
without sin or blemish. We do not 
want boys that have been in saloons, 
that have been in houses of ill-fame, 
that have been gamblers, that have 
been drunkards, that have been in- 
famous in their lives — we do not want 
such to go into the ministry of this holy 
Gospel to represent the Son of the Liv- 
ing God and the power of redemption 
to the world. We want young men that 
have been born or adopted in the cov- 
enant, that have been reared in purity, 
that have kept themselves unspotted 
from the world, and can go into the na- 
tions of the earth and say to men, ''Fol- 
low me, as I follow Christ." Then we 
would like to have them know how to 
sing, and to pray. We expect them to 
be honest, virtuous, and faithful unto 
death to their covenants, to their breth- 
ren, to their wives, to their fathers and 
mothers, to their brothers and sisters, 
to themselves and to Gqd. Where you 
get men like this to preach the Gospel 
to the world, whether they know much 
to begin with or not, the Lord will put 
His Spirit into their hearts, and He will 
crown them with intelligence and power 
to save the souls of men. For t'he germ 
of life is in them. It has not been

vitiated or corrupted; it has not been 
driven away from them. 

God bless all Israel, and preserve the 
life of our beloved President. May He 
fill him with wisdom, with understand- 
ing, and with a knowledge of the neces- 
sities of the whole people and of the 
cause of truth in the world, that he may 
be instrumental in the hands of Al- 
mighty God of meeting every exigency 
of the Church and performing every 
duty that may be required for the sal- 
vation of Israel and for the redemption 
and sanctification of this land, that it 
may be a land of Zion unto us. May 
the blessing of life, peace, health and 
Intelligence rest down upon President 
Cannon also, and upon the Apostles, one 
and all of them, that they and the 
Presidency may be united; that we may 
see eye to eye, and labor as one man 
for the salvation of souls, and especi- 
ally for the preservation and the integ- 
rity of the household of faith. May 
God bless these men, and the Presidents 
of Stakes and their counselors, the High 
Councils, the Bishops and their coun- 
selors, and the Presidents of the High 
Priests. Let me say here that we do 
not want every "old fogey," or any man 
because he is an "old fogey," to be 
joined to the High Priests quorum. 
We want men to be connected with the 
High Priests that have sense and in- 
telligence enough to govern, if they are 
called upon to do so. The office of High 
Priest is the office of Presidency in the 
Church, and men who are High Priests 
should be men possessing more wisdom, 
more intelligence, and more knowledge 
as to how to govern and how to rule in 
righteousness in the Church than any 
other class of people in it. We want 
good men to be High Priests, as well as 
good men to be Seventies. Then we 
want good men to be Elders. May God 
bless the High Priests in their organiza- 
tions in Zion, and the Seventies, and 
the First Seven Presidents of the Seven- 
ties. May He bless the Elders, and the 
lesser Priesthood throughout the 
Church. May God bless the widows, 
and provide for them, through the 
means that He Himself has appointed 
in the Church. May the people of God 
remember their tithes and offerings, and 
obey the laws of God, that there may 
be meat in the storehouse of the Lord, 



to feed the poor, to clothe the naked, to 
educate the orphan, and to take the 
helpless and lift them up and put them 
in a position where they can contend in 
the world successfully for their living, 
equally with those who have guardians 
and protectors to take care of them. 
May God bless Israel, and may peace 
abide upon all the household of faith, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

In Relation to Prayer. 
I would like to add a few words in 
relation to prayer. The testimony that 
President Smith has borne is very true 
and comes home to me with great 
force. It is a subject upon which I 
have had a good many thoughts. I 
have talked to our people in various 
conferences concerning it, and I will 
say here that we should give our wives 
and children the opportunity to pray 
in the family circle. There are men 
who think that unless they pray the 
Lord does not hear the prayer, and 
they are in the habit of doing all the 
praying in their families. I have known 
men who have got into such a habit, 
as President Smith has said, that 
prayer with them is only a form. There 
is a story told of some boys who were 
outside a house while the man of the 
house was praying. One of his sons 
was among the number, but he was 
not where he could hear as well as 
some of his companions; so he asked 
one of the boys where his father was 
at, and I believe they told him he was 
at Jerusalem and the gathering of the 
Jews. "Oh!" said he, "we can go off 
for some time yet." He knew the 
prayer so well that he could tell how 
long it would take to finish it. Now, 
it is a delightful thing to hear little 
children pray. They pray so innocent- 
ly and simply; and I would rather hear 
a little child pray than I would some 
of the ceremonious and formal prayers. 
Some men seem to think that they have 
got to tell the Lord all about it or He 
will not know; so they enter into every 
detail. Well, if the Spirit prompts that, 
it is all right; but it is good for us to 
pray concisely. We should teach our 
children to pray simply and naturally; 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to ask for that which they want. We 
should ask our wives and our daughters 
to pray. Let them do some of the 
praying- in the family. They will enjoy 
it better, and they will come to pray- 
ers more regularly, because they will 
take an interest in them. Brethren, do 
not get the idea that the Lord will not 
hear your wives and daughters. He 
does hear them, and He hears our lit- 
tle children. I would give them the op- 
portunity as soon as they are old 
enough, to ask a blessing, and to pray 
around the family altar, and to ask 
for the things that are in their hearts.

SUNDAY SCHOOL JUBILEE. 



SEMI-CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
SUNDAY SCHOOLS OF THE CHURCH. 



The general jubilee celebration com- 
memorative of the establishment of the 
Sunday schools of the Latter-day 
Saints, in the Rocky Mountains, was 
held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, 
Utah, Sunday evening, October 8, 1899, 
this year being the fiftieth anniversary 
of the organization of the first Sunday 
school in Utah. 

The large Tabernacle was filled to its 
utmost capacity, before the opening 
hour, chiefly by Sabbath school work- 
ers, and very many people were unable 
to gain ingress. In addition to the gen- 
eral decorations of the building, there 
were placed in promiment positions 
large portraits of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, 
and Presidents Brigham Young, John 
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo 
Snow; also a heroic bust picture of 
Richard Ballantyne; life size portraits 
of General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon, President Joseph P. Smith, 
Elders George Goddard, John Morgan 
and most of the members of the Quor- 
um of the Apostles and Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board. Besides the gen- 
eral and Stake officers of the Sunday 
school organization in places reserved, 
there were also seats reserved for and 
occupied by those who had been mem- 
bers of the first Sunday school, those 
who had been Sunday school workers 
forty-five, forty, thirty-five, thirty and 
twenty-five years, and for the hus- 
bands, wives, and children of members 
of the first Sunday school, and reciters, 
from different nations, of the Articles 
of Faith, prize winners, awarding com- 
mittees, the blind and deaf representa- 
tives; also the families of the late El- 
ders Richard Ballantyne, George God- 
dard and John Morgan. 



On the stand were, of the general au- 
thorites of the Church: Presidents 
Lorenzo Snow, George Q. Cannon and 
Joseph F. Smith; Patriarch John 
Smith; members of the Council of 
the Twelve Apostles, Francis M. Ly- 
man, John Henry Smith, Heber J. 
Grant, George Teasdale, Anthon H. 
Lund, Matthias F. Cowley, Abraham O. 
Woodruff, and Rudger Clawson; mem- 
bers of the First Council of Seventies, 
Seymour B. Young, C. D. Fjeldsted, 
George Reynolds, J. Golden Kimball, 
Rulon S. Wells and Joseph W. McMur- 
rin, and Presiding Bishop Wm. B. 
Preston. 

Of the Deseret Sunday School Union 
officers there were: George Q. Cannon, 
general superintendent; Karl G. 
Maeser, assistant general superinten- 
dent; George Reynolds, general treas- 
urer; George D. Pyper, general secre- 
tary, and Leo Hunsaker, assistant gen- 
eral secretary; of the members of the 
Sunday School Union general board, 
George Q. Cannon, Karl G. Maeser, 
George Reynolds, Thomas C. Griggs, 
Joseph W. Summerhays, Levi W. Rich- 
ards, Francis M. Lyman, Heber J. 
Grant, Joseph M. Tanner, George 
Teasdale, and Joseph F. Smith; aids to 
the general board, L. John Nuttall, 
James W. Ure, John F. Bennett, John 
M. Mills, Wm. B. Dougall, Wm. D. 
Owen and Seymour B. Young. 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon presided. 

At 7 p. m. Held's Military band, 
which had kindly volunteered its ser- 
vices for the occasion, and which oc- 
cupied a place in front of the choir 
seats, played an overture by Suppe, 
"Poet and Peasant." 

At 7:20 p. rii. General Superintendent

George Q. Cannon announced the open- 
ing hymn, "Our God, we Raise to 
Thee," which was sung by the Tab- 
ernacle choir and the congregation, un- 
der the leadership of Prof. Evan 
Stephens, Prof. Jos. J. Daynes being 
the organist. 

Prayer was offered by Assistant Gen- 
eral Superintendent Karl G. Maeser. 

The Tabernacle choir sang the hymn, 
"For the Strength of the Hills we 
Bless Thee." 

The roll of Stakes in the Church was 
then called by Secretary George D. 
Pyper, there being present representa- 
tives from all the forty Stakes of 
Zion, as follows: Alberta, Bannock, 
Bear Lake, Beaver Bingham, Box- 
elder, Cache, Cassia, Davis, Emery, 
Fremont, Juab, Juarez, Kanab, Malad, 
Maricopa, Millard, Morgan, Oneida, 
Panguitch, Parowan, Pocatello, Salt 
Lake, San Juan, San Luis, San- 
pete, Sevier, Snowfiake, St. George, 
St. John, St. Joseph, Star Valley, Sum- 
mit, Tooele, Uintah, Wasatch, Utah, 
Wayne, Weber, and Woodruff. 

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT GEO. 
Q. CANNON 

then spoke as follows: 

"It is gratifying to know that every 
Stake has a representative here this 
evening. 

"I see that I am on the program for 
some introductory remarks. The time 
is so short that what I shall say will 
be very brief. 

"I am sure that everyone present 
must be profoundly impressed with this 
assemblage of people this evening. Of 
the many sights we have had of a 
gratifying character, connected with the 
Sunday schools, this certainly excels 
them all. It is exceedingly delightful 
to see the interest that is taken by the 
whole people in this grand work. The 
Sunday school has become an institu- 
tion that is very dear to the hearts 
of this entire people. Every day that 
passes impresses its importance more 
and more on the minds of all. Every 
parent that has right conceptions con- 
cerning the future of their children, 
feels a deep and abiding interest in the 
Sunday school. The Sunday School 
Union board has very little occasion to 
find fault with the management of the 



Sunday schools, or with the lack of in- 
terest manifested by those who ought to 
take interest in it. Everybody recog- 
nizes the value of the Sunday school, 
and of its teachings, but there remains 
a great deal yet to be done. As Sunday 
school workers we should not be content 
until we have brought all the children 
of the land into the Sunday school and 
under its- influence, so that these little 
fellows that now grow wild may be 
humanized and made to feel the respon- 
sibility that will rest upon them when 
they grow to manhood. I am sure that 
everyone that labors in the Sunday 
school feels the importance of training 
their children and getting them to ob- 
serve the Sabbath day and to refrain 
from visiting the street corners, behav- 
ing rudely and boisterously, or going 
fishing or hunting on the day which 
has been set apart by the Almighty for 
His worship, and which ought to be 
sacred in all our hearts. Our children 
should be impressed with the sacredness 
of this day. I hope to see the time when 
we shall have less of this unruly ele- 
ment in our streets and in our homes, 
and when our children shall become 
students in the Sunday school. The 
Sunday school is dear to the hearts of 
those children who do attend. They f ael 
interested in it, and the influence of our 
teachings in the Sunday school is going 
to make, it may be said, a new genera- 
tion. It is but a few years from child- 
hood to manhood, and in our hands, 
Sunday school teachers and superin- 
tendents, is the formation of the char- 
acter of the rising generation. As we 
impress them with the proper feelings 
and thoughts and teach them correct 
habits, so will they grow up to man- 
hood and womanhood, and their influ- 
ence will be felt for good wherever they 
move. 

"I pray God to bless this Sunday 
school movement, to bless every man 
and woman who labors in this cause 
and who devotes himself and herself 
to the promotion of righteousness in the 
midst of the rising generation. I ask 
this blessing in the name of Jesus. 
Amen."

establishment of Sunday Schools in 
these mountain vales. In attempting to 
briefly review the progress and develop- 
ment of the Sunday School cause among 
the Latter-day Saints for half a cen- 
tury past we cannot hope to more than 
glance at the most prominent events 
and refer to a few of the pioneers and 
leaders in this great work. Fifty years 
ago the Saints, after being driven from 
their homes in the East, were settled 
here in peace but not in a land of 
plenty. In search of that peace and re- 
ligious liberty they had come to a land 
dry and barren, a land that was for- 
bidding to all who did not put their 
trust in the true and living God, and 
show forth their faith by hard and per- 
sistent toil. Yet amid the struggles and 
privations of pioneer existence they did 
not forget the education of their child- 
ren. But how meagre were their facil- 
ities for education then compared with 
those we now possess! More than three 
years had passed since they left their 
beautiful city of Nauvoo, on the banks 
of the Mississippi, and set their faces 
towards the wilderness to And a haven 
of rest in the wilds of the Rocky Moun- 
tains. All their supplies had to be haul- 
ed by team more than a thousand miles. 
Their houses were necessarily small and 
poorly lighted. They had but few books; 
and, as a people, their numbers were 
small. 

"While the Saints were in the midst of 
these adverse circumstances, Brother 
Richard Ballantyne, then in the prime 
of life, saw and felt the need of religi- 
ous instruction being imparted to the 
young. When he arrived here in 1848 
he settled in the Old Fort, and while 
still there, in the month of May, 1849, 
he formed the purpose of starting a 
Sunday school for the education of the 
youth in the principles of the Gospel 
and a knowledge of the scriptures. In 
speaking of this he said, 'That was the 
main purpose, — to teach them the Gos- 
pel, because I felt it was very precious 
to me and I thought it would be precious 
to them, and it was my duty to do 
that.' Having no suitable place in 
which to carry out his noble design, he 
determined to build one. He had a city 
lot in the Fourteenth Ward,— now des- 
ignated as the northeast corner of First 
West and Third South Streets. He 



moved his two wagons there and about 
the last of May commenced to gather 
materials and erect a building that was 
to be his home and school house. From 
then until early winter he labored to ac- 
complish this purpose. The rock was 
hauled from Red Butte, and adobes 
from the old adobe yard, the lumber 
from Mill Creek canyon, which he paid 
for by hauling the logs on shares. Ex- 
cepting the doors and windows he did 
the work of building with his own 
hands. In front of his lot he placed a 
neat pole fence. Not unmindful of the 
good influence of pleasant surroundings 
and with all other labors before him, in 
the spring he procured cottonwood 
trees from City Creek canyon and 
planted some for shade in front of the 
lot and others for a small grove near 
his future school and home. The house, 
when finished, was built of adobes, with 
a dirt roof, the windows and paneled 
doors were painted; in size it was 18 
feet wide by 20 feet long outside, be- 
sides a smaller room used by the family 
for a living room. The school room, 
for those times, was well lighted. The 
seats were long benches, made of slabs, 
extending the width of the room. 

"On the morning of the second Sun- 
day in December, 1849, all was ready. 
He with his wife and babe and the 
members of the school were gathered 
there. In their presence he solemnly 
dedicated by prayer the room for the 
purpose for which it was designed. The 
Sunday school numbered about 50 pu- 
pils, among whom were members of the 
families of Apostles John Taylor, Wil- 
ford Woodruff, Parley P. Pratt, Frank- 
lin D. Richards, and others. They fur- 
nished their own books. The lessons 
were from the New Testament, Book 
of Mormon and Doctrine and Coven- 
ants, mostly from the New Testament. 
The children were willing to attend. 
They were seldom absent although the 
school began at 8 o'clock in the morn- 
ing, closing in time for those who 
wished to attend the general meeting 
of the Saints. His Bishop, John Mur- 
dock, to whom he was second counselor, 
was in hearty accord with him in all 
his efforts. He carried on the school 
himself successfully for about a year. 
In the meantime the Fourteenth Ward 
had erected a meeting house, and in the

fall of 1850 the Sunday school moved 
Into it. Bro. Ballantyne was the Sup- 
erintendent, assisted by Bro. Joseph 
Horne, Bro. Phineas Richards and sev- 
eral teachers. When Bro. Ballantyne 
left on a three years' mission to Hin- 
dustan, in 1852, Bro. Horne succeeded 
him as superintendent of the Sunday 
school. 

"In succeeding years, many others in- 
spired with a similar interest in the 
education of the children, became 
pioneers or leaders in Sunday school 
work in other wards and settlements. 
Bro. Ballantyne, after his return home, 
organized a Sunday school in 1856, in 
the Fifteenth Ward, which he thought 
was one of the best he had ever seen, 
because of the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit upon it, and especially in the 
spirit of testimony that rested upon the 
pupils. Thus other Sunday schools were 
organized and maintained amid the 
many privations, hardships and charges 
that marked the early settlements of 
the Saints. With the increase of pop- 
ulation and facilities for education the 
interest in Sunday schools has grown 
until a ward is not considered complete 
without one or more live Sunday schools 
in it. 

"On the 4th of November, 1867, a 
meeting of those interested in the Sun- 
day schools of the Saints was held at 
the Thirteenth Ward Assembly Hall, 
Salt Lake City, for the purpose of or- 
ganizing a Sunday School Union. This 
was the first meeting held for that pur- 
pose. There not being so many present 
as was anticipated, the meeting ad- 
journed until the 11th of that month at 
the same place. On the latter occasion 
there was a large attendance; among 
those present were Presidents Brigham 
Young and Daniel H. Wells, also Apost- 
les George A. Smith. Wilford Woodruff, 
George Q. Cannon, and Brigham Young 
Jr. At this meeting the first steps were 
taken towards a permanent organiza- 
tion, and Elder George Q. Cannon was 
elected president, with a secretary and 
two corresponding secretaries. A com- 
mittee of three were also appointed to 
examine and decide upon books suit- 
able for use in our Sunday schools. 

"During the meeting President Brig- 
ham Young spoke at considerable 
length, instructing those present on 



various points connected with the Sun- 
day, school movement, and the cause of 
education in general. He was followed 
by Elder George A. Smith and George 
Q. Cannon. The latter stated that 
Elder David O. Calder had kindly vol- 
unteered to teach the tonic sol-fa sys- 
tem of music to the Sunday school 
teachers, as soon as a sufficient num- 
ber came forward to form a class. 

"It was not until 1872 that the Sun- 
day School Union assumed a more com- 
pact and definite shape. In the June 
of that year a committee, appointed at 
a meeting of Sunday school officers and 
teachers, and composed of Brothers 
George Goddard, John Morgan and 
John B. Maiben waited upon General 
Superintendent George Q. Cannon, pre- 
sented the minutes of the meeting for 
his approval and invited his counsel 
and co-operation in bringing about a 
wider concert of action to give greater 
impetus and solidity to the efforts of 
the Union. The result was that from 
that time the efforts and labors of the 
Union assumed a more practical shape, 
and thereafter monthly meetings of the 
teachers and superintendents were held 
in Salt Lake City with great regularity; 
at first in the City Hall, then in the 14th 
Ward Assembly Rooms, afterwards in 
the Council House, and still later in the 
Assembly Hall. These meetings con- 
tinued to grow in proportions and inter- 
est until they were among the most 
popular and most largely attended of 
any of the assemblies of the people of 
Zion. 

"In reading the minutes of the regu'ar 
meetings of the Union, it is exceedingly 
interesting to note that the same sub- 
jects that are still considered among the 
most important were then canvassed 
with much vigor, and that the instuc- 
tions given were, to a very great extent, 
the same, slightly differing according 
to altered circumstances, as those that 
it is still found necessary to inculcate. 
The subjects of punctuality, the grading 
of the schools, prizes, rewards, the nec- 
essity of readers adjusted to the use of 
the Sabbath schools of the Saints, of a 
collection of hymns and songs composed 
by members of the Church, with suit- 
able music; of a primary catechism, and 
the publication of other suitable works, 
keeping better registers of attendance, 



SUN DA 1 SCHOOL JUBILEE.

improved records, correct and punctual 
reports, selection of suitable books for 
Sunday school libraries, securing larger 
average attendance, and the use of the 
scriptures for text books in the classes — 
all these and many other subjects that 
still have to be considered, are to be 
found among the teachings of the gen- 
eral superintendency and others of the 
brethren from the time that these meet- 
ings were first held. These instructions 
have not been in vain. Not only has 
the Union increased in numbers, year 
by year, but in compactness also, and a 
greater uniformity has been reached in 
the methods of teaching and in the 
modes of conducting the schools. At 
first there was considerable diversity of 
operation in the Sunday schools situat- 
ed in the various Stakes of Zion; but 
today, through experience, better me- 
thods have been attained which secure 
greater uniformity and more satisfact- 
ory results. Class readers, such as 
those used in the day schools, and which 
were once so widely used in the Sunday 
schools are now almost entirely exclud- 
ed from the latter, and in their place we 
have the First and Second Readers pub- 
lished by the Union. 

"The organization of schools into the 
Union for some time proceeded slowly 
in the more remote settlements, but 
in the more complete organizations of 
the Stakes of Zion, which took place a 
short time previous to the death of 
President Brigham Young, was found 
the means by which the good influence 
of the Union could be extended to the 
most distant schools, through the pre- 
siding officers of those various Stakes; 
and Stake superintendents of Sunday 
schools are now almost invariably ap- 
pointed when the organization of a 
Stake is perfected; so that, today, in 
every Stake of Zion, as there is a Stake 
president, there is also a Stake superin- 
tendent of Sunday schools, subject to 
the president of the Stake, with assis- 
tant officers to look after and care for 
the Sunday school interests in that 
Stake. 

"In the year 1877 a new feature of 
much importance was introduced, by 
direction of the First Presidency of the 
Church, into the services of the Sunday 
schools. We refer to the administration 
of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. 



It was directed that this should be done 
by the Bishops or under their direction. 
The effects of this counsel, where car- 
ried out in the spirit of the instructions 
given, have been marked for good. A 
better understanding of the divine mis- 
sion of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ and of His atonement for the 
sins of the world has been given to our 
children, and they are constantly re- 
minded by partaking of these emblems, 
together with suitable hymns sung, and 
instructions given on this subject at 
these times, of the necessity of honor- 
ing their Savior, of reverencing His 
name, and obeying His laws. 

"Nor in our review of what the Union 
has accomplished must we forget the 
impetus it has given to the development 
of musical talent in the midst of the 
Saints. We feel satisfied, we can say 
without undue vanity, that no single 
agency has done so much in this direc- 
tion as it has and the results are emin- 
ently satisfactory, showing as a people, 
we have many among us whose com- 
positions are worthy of high praise, 
with a constantly developing standard 
of excellence. The means adopted by 
the Union to accomplish this have been 
various. Among others, the constant 
inculcation of the necessity of good 
singing in the Sunday schools by all 
the teachers and pupils; the establish- 
ment of the Deseret Sunday School 
Musical Union and the organization of 
the Union's brass band; the holding, for 
many years, commencing in 1874, of 
musical festivals in the Large Taber- 
nacle in Salt Lake City, an example 
which has been followed in many of 
our other large settlements; the award- 
ing of prizes for the best original mus- 
ical compositions and poetry; the publi- 
cation in the Juvenile Instructor of 
numerous pieces of original music; the 
issuance of scores of thousands of musi- 
cal cards; later of a Union Music Book, 
then a Hymn Book, and still later the 
publication of the Song Book and the 
Hymn Book now in use. Of these sev- 
eral editions have been already publish- 
ed. 

"With pleasure we refer to the value 
that the Juvenile Instructor, edited by 
Elder George Q. Cannon, has been in 
aiding the great Sunday school work. 
Its advent in January, 1866, antedated 



80

the organization of the Union, and from 
its commencement it has been our con- 
stant friend. The publication in its 
columns of the catechisms on the Bible, 
Book of Mormon, Church History, etc., 
its musical pages, its editorial teach- 
ings, and many other of its features, 
have rendered it a necessity in our Sun- 
day schools whose influence can scarce- 
ly be over-estimated. It is now the re- 
cognized official organ of the General 
Board of the Union. Its value lies dis- 
tinctly in the fact that through its 
pages unity and harmony of action can 
be brought about throughout all our 
schools, and the instructions of the gen- 
eral officers can reach the remotest 
schools, where otherwise, through lack 
of personal visits, they would often be 
at a loss to keep step with the rest of 
the Union. It is true that some slight 
variations, arising from local peculiar- 
ities, must always exist, and with which 
it would be unwise to interfere, but the 
general rules suggested by the Union 
have been almost universally adopted 
in our schools throughout the length 
and breadth of our settlements, with 
most gratifying results. Among these 
suggestions are: 

"That the school should always be 
promptly opened at the time appointed; 
which, wherever practicable, should be 
ten o'clock in the morning. 

"That the singing should be done by 
the whole school, and not simply by a 
selected choir of a few voices. 

"That the Sacrament should be ad- 
ministered every Sunday. 

"That the readers used should be the 
Scriptures and other works of the 
Church and publications approved by 
the General Board. 

"That primary and infant classes 
should be established, where the little 
ones can be taught orally by one or 
more of the most experienced teachers. 
Whenever possible this should be done 
in a room separate from the rest of the 
school. 

"That every school should be fully 
organized with a complete set of of- 
ficers, and that every male officer and 
teacher should hold some portion of the 
Priesthood. 

"That when the school is dismissed 
the children should leave in order, class 
by class; and when consistent, to the 
music of a march on the organ. 



"That teachers' meetings should be 
held at least once a month, for the re- 
gulation of school matters and the in- 
struction of the teachers. 

"That public reviews should be had 
at such stated intervals as are con- 
sidered most convenient and profitable 
by the officers of the schools. 

"That the Sunday school officers 
should always work in harmony with 
the local presiding Priesthood, and seek 
to carry out their counsel with diligence 
and in good faith. 

"That continued efforts, through Sun- 
day school visitors or otherwise, should 
be strenuously made to obtain the at- 
tendance at school of every child of 
sufficient age belonging to the ward. 

"It would be ungenerous not to refer 
to the immense amount of labor per- 
formed by the brethren and sisters of 
the various committees connected with 
the getting up and carrying to success- 
ful conclusion of our mammoth celebra- 
tions in the Tabernacle; the decorations 
on more than one occasion of this vast 
building with evergreens, flowers, etc., 
the formation of the beautiful center- 
pieces that adorned it, and many other 
duties associated therewith, were all 
labors of love, but which at the same 
time required much toil, unwearied pa- 
tience and a large amount of time to ex- 
ecute. Nor were these alone; the ex- 
ecutive, finance, musical, reception and 
other committees all had their hands 
full of a pleasurable work, and they 
performed it in such a successful man- 
ner as to meet, as it deserved, with un- 
iversal commendation and approval 
from the Latter-day Saints. 

In 1884 the general monthly meetings 
were given in charge of the Stake Sun- 
day school authorities, and the general 
meetings of the Union were appointed 
to be held twice a year at the times of 
the General Conferences of the Church. 

"Some of the principal events of 
recent* years have been: the holding of 
an annual Sunday School Conference in 
each Stake, visited almost invariably 
by one or more members of the General 
Board; the organization of a Sunday 
School for the deaf mutes and one for 
the blind, the more thorough grading 
of the pupils into different departments; 
the establishment of Nickel Day, on 
which all members of the Sunday 
Schools are invited to contribute, at

least one nickel to aid the Sunday 
School cause; the observance of Hu- 
mane Day, on which special efforts are 
made to inculcate the principles and 
practice of kindness and mercy to an- 
imals; the holding- of a Sunday School 
Convention in November, 1898, which 
was numerously attended by delegates 
from the different Schools and Stakes 
extending from Canada to Mexico, and 
which proved to be a grand success; 
the delivery of a series of lectures on 
Sunday School work by Dr. Karl G. 
Measer at the special request of the 
officers of the Union; these lectures 
were revised and published by the 
Union for the benefit of the Sunday 
school workers; the organization by 
permission of the warden, of a Bible 
class or Sunday school in the Utah 
Penitentiary, by President George Q. 
Cannon while he and other brethren 
were imprisoned there for conscience 
sake; the special request each year 
for Sunday school statistics from the 
different missions abroad, the rapid in- 
crease of Sunday schools in those mis- 
sions; and the many calls for gratu- 
itous aid to them and other special 
Sunday schools responded to by the 
Union; the publication of the Latter- 
day Saints Sunday School Treatise, 
upon which considerable care, time and 
labor were bestowed, and of which, af- 
te** careful revision, a second large edi- 
tion has recently been issued; the 
publication of the first and second Book 
of Mormon Charts, each containing 12 
original illustrations, also small cards 
on which are the same pictures and 
short scripture lessons, and with each 
chart a guide to its use; the prepara- 
tion of lessons on the Bible, the Book 
of Mormon and History of the Church 
in leaflet form. The first 31 numbers 
contain the life of the Savior. The vast 
amount of literary and other work done 
by members of the board, much of 
which we have not time to even men- 
tion, has been done without pecuniary 
compensation. It has been a labor of 
love and duty. Last, but not least, 
interruption to the regular sessions of 
the Sunday schools had become so 
numerous through funerals and various 
conferences being held on Sunday 
mornings, and the effects of these in- 
terruptions had proved to be so injuri- 



ous to this work that the First Presi- 
dency published a circular letter over 
their own signatures to correct this 
evil. This was also in harmony with 
the action of President Young, in dis 
continuing the Sunday morning services 
in the Tabernacle, so that they might 
not interfere with the Sunday schools. 

OFFICERS OF THE UNION. 

"First organization, November 11, 
1867. George Q. Cannon, President; 
Edward L. Sloan, secretary; George 
Goddard and Robert L. Campbell, cor-

perintendent; George Goddard, assist- 
ant general superintendent; John B. 
Maiben, general secretary; William Mc- 
Lachlan, general treasurer. 

"In August, 1875, Elder Maiben hav- 
ing been called to be Bishop at Manti, 
resigned the office of general secretary, 
and Elder McLachlan was appointed 
his successor. He acted as secretary 
and treasurer for a few months, when 
he was called on a mission to New 
Zealand. 

"The vacancies thus caused were filled 
by the appointment of Levi W. Rich- 
ards (Dec, 1875) to be the general sec- 
retar- and George Reynolds (Feb., 
1876) the general treasurer of the Union. 
Elder Reynolds had been acting as au- 
ditor and treasurer, pro tem, of the 
Union. At the same time (Dec,, 1875), 
Thomas Champneys was appointed as- 
sistant secretary; and after his removal 
to Ogden, John C. Cutler was appointed 
to that office and al60 to be assistant

"In 1878, Samuel L. Evans and William 
Willis were appointed Sunday school 
missionaries at large. In June, 1883, 
the organization of the general board 
of officers was made complete by the 
appointment of John Morgan to be the 
second assistant general superintendent 
of the Union. 

"After the death of Elder Morgan, on 
July 14th, 1894, Karl G. Maeser was ap- 
pointed his successor in the superin- 
tendency. 

"At the close of 1890 Elder Richards 
resigned the office of general secretary

and John M. Whitaker was appointed 
to that position. On his departure on 
a mission he was succeeded, in 1897, by 
George D. Pyper, the present general 
secretary. The resignation of Elder 
Cutler made a vacancy in the office of 
assistant general secretary which has 
been filled by the appointment of Leo 
Hunsaker. 

"The decease of Elder George God- 
dard in January, 1899, left the position 
of first assistant general superintendent 
of the Union vacant. 

"We cannot specify all the changes in 
the general board, but the following 
have been or are now members of it:

Young and Christian D. Fjeldsted. 

"The Deseret Sunday School Musical 
Union was organized in 1875; director, 
Charles J. Thomas. 

"The Musical Union was an organiza- 
tion of short duration; but the willing 
and efficient public services of David O. 
Calder, Charles J. Thomas, Ebenezer 
Beesley, Adam C. Smyth, John S. 
Lewis, Thomas C. Griggs, George Care- 
less, Thomas Mclntyre, Joseph J. Day- 
nes, Evan Stephens and others in pro- 
moting the musical interests of our 
Sunday schools generally, well deserve 
remembrance in this brief review. 

ORGANIZATION. 

"Each Sunday school when fully or- 
ganized has a superintendent, first and 
second assistant superintendents, sec- 
retary, treasurer, librarian, chorister, 
and such assistant officers as may be 
needed. The school is graded into de- 
partments, namely: The theological, 
second intermediate, first intermediate, 
primary, and infant or kindergarten. 



Each department has several teachers, 
one of whom is appointed the head 
teacher in the department. 

"All the Sunday schools in a Stake are 
organized with a Stake Sunday school 
superintendent, first and second assist- 
ant superintendents, secretary and 
treasurer and assistant officers when 
needed. Also, in many of the Stakes, 
there are missionary aids, who visit 
the Sunday schools and labor under 
the direction of the Stake Sunday school 
superintendents to whom they report 
their labors. 

"Besides these are mission superinten- 
dents of Sunday schools in the different 
missions. 

"All these are included in a general or- 
ganization entitled the Deseret Sunday 
School Union. The general supervision 
and management of the affairs of the 
Union are vested in a general board, 
composed of a general superintendent, 
first and second assistant general su- 
perintendents, general secretary, gen- 
eral treasurer, and assistant general 
secretary, an executive committee 
and a number of aids. 

STATISTICS. 

"There was no general attempt made 
to gather statistics of the Sunday 
schools until 1872; since then efforts 
have been made each year to secure full 
and correct reports, but with only par- 
tial success. 

"We only attempt to give the figures 
of the two years, 1872 and 1898. 

"In 1872 there were 190 schools, of 
which 41 did not report. In the 149 
schools reported there were 1,408 officers 
and teachers and 13,373 pupils. Total, 
14,781. 

"In 1898 there were forty Stakes of 
Zion, containing 639 Sunday schools, 11,- 
384 officers and teachers and 93,388 
pupils. Total 104,772. Besides these 
there were 16 missions that reported 
378 Sunday Schools, 1,933 officers and 
teachers and 9,998 pupils. Total, 11,931. 
The grand total was 116,703 officers, 
teachers and pupils. 

"In conclusion we cannot but point 
with gratitude and pride to the results 
which, under heaven's continued bless- 
ings, the Union has already brought 
about, and to the bright and cheering 
prospects that illumine our future and

bid us persevere in the good work. To 
say that it has been a potent instrument 
of religious culture, of social refinement, 
and moral worth, a factor in the devel- 
opment of God's purposes, a bond of 
union among his people, a source of 
strength to the Church, and an aid to 
the Priesthood would, we submit, not 
be claiming too much; and this posi- 
tion is all the more gratifying when 
we consider how vast has been the la- 
bor performed and how slight has been 
the cost in dollars and cents, to the 
community. The officers, committees, 
etc., have been veritable workers with- 
out purse and scrip. We believe, though 
perhaps in our zeal we may err, that 
seldom, if ever, have as great results 
been achieved with so small or so few 
contributions from the pockets of the 
people; and we trust in future reports 
to be able to state that our publication 
department has become self-sustaining, 
or, better still, a source of income to the 
institution. For we have an ardent de- 
sire to increase the value of our literary 
productions, and so continue until the 
works published by the Union shall 
have become a power in the land for 
righteousness, and for our children's 
salvation — a power for God and His 
truth." 

GENERAL, SUPERINTENDENT GEO. 
Q. CANNON 

next introduced the members of the 
first Sunday school, saying: 

"On the left of the stand are the sur- 
viving members of the first Sunday 
school, of which we have heard a des- 
cription by Elder Lyman, and the roll 
will be called. The original roll, if 
there ever was one, cannot be found, 
but. after years of inquiry, a number 
of those who were members of that 
school have been found, and their 
names are enrolled and will be read by 
the secretary, and, as they are read, we 
wish each member to arise and say, 
'present.' If there are any who are ab- 
sent, whose names are called. Brother 
Summerhays will explain the cause of 
their absence. Then badges will be 
given to them." 

SECRETARY GEORGE D. PTPER

SUNDAY SCHOOL JUBILEE. 



ELDER ANGUS M. CANNON. 

a member of the first school, spoke as 
follows : 

"The impression made upon my mind 
this evening, compared with my at- 
tendance at the first Sabbath school, is 
very great. There may have been fifty 
scholars in the original Sabbath school 
during the time that it was held in 
Brother Ballantyne's house, but if there 
were a dozen persons present when the 
class was formed, I fail to remember it. 
The Fourteenth ward was fenced with 
poles around the entire ward, bars 
being placed at the entrance of each 
street. Brother Ballantyne's house 
was new, and was made very comfort- 
able with benches constructed hastily 
for our accommodation. Brother Bal- 
lantyne's soul was swallowed up in the 
good effects- that this school would have 
upon the youth of this people; and I 
will say the impressions that were cre- 
ated upon my mind regarding the ob- 
ject that God has in calling us from 
the world unto Zion was marked and 
has helped to shape my character up to 
the present time. 

"We were familiar with poverty. The 
meeting house that was occupied in this 
city stood on the southeast corner of 
this block, known as the mud-covered 
bowery, constructed of Spanish adobies, 
one foot by eighteen inches in size. The 
meeting place we occupied in the Four- 
teenth ward was in the house of Dr. 
Richardson, a little log hut. The meet- 
ing house we occupied in the Seventh 
ward was Samuel Pitehforth's resi- 
dence, where testimony meetings were 
held, and faith in God was promoted 
in our hearts. We rejoiced in the testi- 
mony that God gave us of His truth, 
having been informed by Brother Bal- 
lantyne that God had indeed restored 
the Gospel, established His Priesthood 
among men, called us from darkness 
untO' light, from the world unto Zion, 
and that we were not to be of the world, 
but that we were to be the children of 
God, under the everlasting covenant; 
being taught that Joseph the Prophet, 
and Hyrum, his brother, had been mar- 
tyred for the testimony of Jesus, and 
that we should be devoted to His cause, 
deny ourselves luxuries, be content with 
the necessaries of life, living in houses 



constructed by our industry, and pos- 
sessing sufficient comfort to promote 
our health and give us strength, that 
we might cultivate these then barren 
wastes, procure the necessaries of life, 
carry the Gospel to a dark and benight- 
ed world, proclaiming that God has 
spoken from heaven for the regenera- 
tion of mankind, and to teach us that 
He was our Heavenly Father, and that 
our destiny was to become His children 
and enter into His celestial presence. 

"How faithfully Brother Ballantyne's 
testimony has been observed in the in- 
crease of Sunday schools, is evidenced 
tonight in the number that are here as- 
sembled. And when I remember that 
God has promised us this increase and 
prosperity, and still greater increase 
and prosperity, provided we are loyal to 
Him, every fibre of my being seems to 
enter in with my whole soul to 
pledge God loyalty, to observe 
faithfully, to pay my tithes and 
offerings unto Him, in hope that 
He will give my children faith and 
make them firm supporters of His work 
in the establishment of His Gospel as 
He has revealed it and restored His 
Priesthood in these the last days. 

"I thank you for this opportunity, and 
for the honor conferred upon me, and 
pray God's blessing to be upon the gen- 
eral superintendency, the superinten- 
dents, the teachers and the scholars, 
and all the associations of Zion through- 
out the whole world, in the name of Je- 
sus. Amen." 

"Zion's Sunday School Jubilee Hymn," 
(words and music written for this occa- 
sion) was sung by the Tabernacle choir. 

Then followed the presentation of the 
gold medal awarded to Emily H. Wood- 
mansee for the best hymn; also gold 
medal to the Rev. W. Daunt Scott, for 
the best musical composition. 

The presentation was made by 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT, 

of the Deseret Sunday School Union 
board, who spoke as follows: 

"A committee consisting of John 
Nicholson, Joshua H. Paul and George 
H. Brimhall was selected by the Sunday 
School Union board to examine all 
hymns that were submitted in this com- 
petition and to decide upon the best 
composition. The committee were unan-

imous in awarding the gold medal for 
the words of this hymn to Sister Emily 
H. Woodmansee. 

"The committee appointed to examine 
the music and make the award for the 
best musical composition consisted of 
Arthur Shepherd, Anthony Lund and 
Squire Coop. They were unanimous in 
awarding the gold medal to Rev. W. 
Daunt Scott. 
'■'±'he Sunday School Union always has 
endeavored to get the best possible re- 
sults by giving medals and prizes for 
musical compositions, and it gives me 
much pleasure, on behalf of the board, 
to present these medals to Sister Emily 
H. Woodmansee and to Rev. W. Daunt 
Scott." 

The medals were pinned upon the 
prize winners by Mary Alice Hoagland 
Cannon and Maggie Peart Cardall. 

A POLYGLOT RECITATION OF THE 
ARTICLES OF FAITH 

was then given under the direc- 
tion of Elder George Teasdale, of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union board. In 
this recitation a number of persons rep- 
resenting different nationalities dressed 
in the native costume, recited in the 
native tongue the Articles of 
Faith. On opening this exercise. Elder 
Teasdale read a portion of the 107th 
Psalm, as follows: 

"O give thanks unto the Lord, for He 
is good; for His mercy endureth for- 
ever. 

"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. 
whom He hath redeemed from the hand 
of the enemy; 

"And gathered them out of the lands, 
from the east, and from the west, from 
the north, and from the south. 

"They wandered in the wilderness in 
a solitary way; they found no city to 
dwell in. 

"Hungry and thirsty, their soul faint- 
ed in them . 

."Then they cried unto the Lord in 
their trouble, and He delivered them 
out of their distresses. 

"And He led them forth by the right 
way. that they might go to a city of 
habitation. 

"Oh that men would praise the Lord 
for His groodness, and for His wonder- 
ful works to the children of men!" 

The recitation of the Articles of Faith 
was in the following order: 

"1. We believe in God, the Eternal 
Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, 
and in the Holy Ghost."

and Marie Antoinette Lang, French re- 
presentatives from Salt Lake Stake.

taining to the Kingdom of God." 

Italian representatives had been as- 
signed this recitation in Italian, but 
they failed to respond and the article 
was read in English by Elder Teasdale. 

"10. We believe in the literal gather- 
ing of Israel and in the restoration of

tives from Salt Lake Stake, the first 
named having been on a mission to 
Turkey. 

"13. We believe in being honest, true,

ing good to all men; indeed we may say 
that we follow the admonition of Paul. 
'We believe all things, we hope all 
things,' we have endured many things, 
and hope to be able to endure all things. 
If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or 
of good report or praiseworthy, we seek 
after these things." 

Recitation in Celtic, by Wm. A. 
Morton and companion, Irish represen-

("United States), representatives from 
Davis Stake, by Roger Horrocks and 



Sarah Roberts, English representatives 
from Wasatch Stake, and by Ezra C. 
Robinson and Zina T. Card, Canadian

Elder Teasdale then stated that, in 
addition to the nations that had been 
represented in the recitation of the Ar- 
ticles of Faith the Gospel had been 
preached in other lands, as follows: 

Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Finland, 
Russia, Hungary, Bohemia, Austria, 
Belgium, Friendly Islands, Marquesas 
Islands, Tuamotu Islands, Cook Archi- 
pelago, Leaward Islands, Austral Is- 
lands, Palestine, Turkey in Europe, 
Danubian principalities, Spain, Hin- 
dustan, Malta, Africa, China, Siam, 
Chili, East Indies, West Indies, Greece, 
Philippines, Japan and other countries. 

All of those who had taken part in 
the recitation of the Articles of Faith 
then responded in unison to the follow- 
ing invitation from Elder Teasdale: 

"Now we will repeat in concert what 
has brought this all about, this wonder- 
ful gathering from the north, south, 
east and west, by a recitation of the 
sixth and seventh verses of the four- 
teenth chapter of Revelation, in the En- 
glish language, by the representatives 
of these nations." The passages recited 
in concert are as follows: 

"6. And I saw another angel fly in 
the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel to preach unto them that 
dwell on the earth, and to every nation, 
and kindred, and tongue, and people." 

"7. Saying with a loud voice, Fear 
God, and give glory to him; for the hour 
of his judgment is come; and worship 
him that made heaven, and earth, and 
the sea, and the fountains of waters." 

When this had been done Elder Teas- 
dale spoke to the vast assemblage as 
follows: 

"We bear testimony that this angel 
has flown through the midst of heaven, 
and restored the everlasting Gospel, 
thus bringing to pass the gathering of 
this people, whom God hath redeemed 
from the hand of the enemy, gathered 
from the north, south, east and west, 
and brought to the marvelous light of 
His everlasting Gospel; and this won- 
derful, immense, assemblage of people 
gathered here tonight, to the glory of 
God, our Eternal Father, has been ac- 
complished by the visitation of this 
angel and the restoration of the Ever- 
lasting Gospel. To God and the Lamb be 
all glory, forever and ever. Amen." 

It was announced by President Geo. 
Q. Cannon that the Deaf Mute Sunday 
school was on the program for the reci- 
tation of the Lord's Prayer, but the 
school was quarantined owing to the 
prevalence of scarlet fever. Instead of

87 



this exercise the assistant superinten- 
dent of the Deaf Mute and Blind Sun- 
day school, Elder Laron Pratt, of Salt 
Lake City, gave, in the deaf mute 
sign language, the hymn, "O, My 
Father," which was vocalized by his 
daughter, Maude Pratt-Griggs, who 
sang the hymn in the English language. 

President Geo. Q. Cannon then stated 
that the school for the blind being 
quarantined also, on account of scarlet 
fever, the members could not be pre- 
sent, but in place thereof, Elder Joseph 
Hodgins, blind from his birth, read from 
the 29th chapter of Isaiah, the 9th, 10th, 
11th, 12th, 13th, 18th and 19th verses. 
The reading was from a Bible for the 
blind, the reader following the raised 
letters with his fingers. The verses are 
as follows: 

"9. Stay yourselves, and wonder; 
cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, 
but not with wine; they stagger, but 
not with strong drink. 

"10. For the Lord hath poured out 
upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and 
hath closed your eyes; the prophets 
and your rulers, the seers hath he cov- 
ered. 

"11. And the vision of all is become 
unto you as the words of a book that 
is sealed, which men deliver to one that 
is learned, saying, Read this, I pray 
thee: and he saith, I cannot: for it is 
sealed: 

"12. And the book is delivered to him 
that is not learend, saying, Read this, 
I pray thee: and he saith, I am not 
learned. 

"13. Wherefore the Lord said, For- 
asmuch as this people draw near me 
with their mouth, and with their lips do 
honour me, but have removed their 
heart far from me, and their fear to- 
ward me is taught by the prophet of 
men : 

"18. And in that day shall the deaf 
hear the words of the book, and the 
eyes of the blind shall see out of ob- 
scurity, and out of darkness. 

"19. The meek also shall increase 
their joy in the Lord, and the poor 
among men shall rejoice in the Holy 
One of Israel." 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon then introduced in order the 
Sunday school officers and teachers who 
had been in service for 25, 30, 35, 40 and 
45 years, respectively, and badges were 
pinned onthe breasts of those present 
by daughters of members of the first 
Sunday school. 

While the badges were being distri- 
buted a selection from "Lucia di Lam- 
mermoor," by Donizetti, was played by 
Held's Military band. 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW 

then briefly addressed the vast congre- 
gation as follows: 

"I wish that I had words to express 
ny astonishment at what I have wit- 
nessed during the accomplishment of 
this program. I feel in my heart to say, 
God bless the Sunday School Union, and 
all who have taken part in pushing for- 
ward its interests. In all my travels 
through the world I have never seen 
anything that delighted me more than 
that which I have witnessed this even- 
ing. Your Superintendent, President 
George Q. Cannon, — I ask that the Lord 
will pour His Holy Spirit upon him 
abundantly in the future, as He has 
done in the past, in carrying forward 
the interests of this grand and glorious 
Sunday school work. Nothing can be 
shown in the world like that that has 
been shown tonight. God bless every 
person who has been engaged 
in the interests of the Sun- 
day schools — the superintendents, 
the aids, and everyone that has thus 
been employed, God bless them. He 
most assuredly has blessed them, and 
a success has been accomplished that 
is certainly wonderful. Gor> bless the 
Sunday School Union. Amen." 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 
Also addressed the meeting as fol- 
lows: 

"It is said somewhere in the good old 
book that there is nothing new under 
the sun. That which we have witnessed 
here this evening comes about as near 
being a contradiction of this scripture 
as any thing I ever have seen. We will 
not dispute the language of the wise 
man in relation to this matter. We will 
be contented with saying that it is 
something that is new under the electric 
lights. The repetition of the "Articles 
of Faith' in nineteen different languages 
and dialects (the result of the procla- 
mation of this Gospel within the last 
sixty years) is something of which we 
may well be proud. I congratulate the 
Superintendent of the Sunday Schools 
and his efficient aids and assistants, on 
the most wonderful display that has 
ever been made here, this evening, of 
the progress that is being made in the 
Sunday Schools, and in this glorious 
effort to promulgate the Truth. I can 
only repeat the words of our beloved 



88 



SUNDAY SCHOOL JUBILEE. 



President, God bless our Sunday 
Schools." 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON 

then said: 

"It is only proper that credit should 
be given to those who have done the 
work in preparing for this Jubilee. The 
brethern have taken hold of this with 
great zeal, and, as you have seen, they 
have made a success of that which they 
have undertaken. I cannot claim any 
credit myself, for my other duties have 
absorbed my time to a great extent. 
Still, I have counseled and directed to 
some extent. The workers on the 
Board, however, and those who have 
assisted them, deserve whatever credit 
there is for that which we have seen 
and heard here tonight. I am pleased 
to be able to give them this meed of 
praise. 

"I may say that the Sunday school 
has been very dear to me. When I 
returned from Europe, after filling con- 
tinuous missions for a long time, I felt 
there was an immense field in Zion for 
the labors of the Elders. I had seen 
how few souls could be gathered 
abroad, and when I reflected upon the 
numbers of our children at home, I 
felt a burning desire to spend all the 
time I could in trying to teach them 
the principles of the Gospel. Upon my 
return, in 1864, I organized a Sunday 
School in the 14th Ward, and other 
schools were organized directly after- 



wards.. As soon thereafer as I could 
I published a little work, which I named 
the 'Juvenile Instructor.' The 'Juv- 
enile Instructor' has been one of the 
best labors that I have ever been en- 
gaged in, because I have felt that it 
was doing good to our children. We 
can see today what an immense field 
is spread around us, furnisning every 
opportunity for every one who desires 
to thrust in his sickle and reap. 
"I am thankful to have President Snow 
and President Smith here to bless us, 
as they have tonight, and I pray that 
their blessings will be fulfilled, as I 
know they will be." 

Gen. Supt. George Q. Cannon an- 
nounced that those entitled to badges, 
who had not received them, could ob- 
tain them by calling on the secretary of 
the Sunday School Union, in the Union 
office in the Templeton building, Salt 
Lake City. 

The choir and congregation, accom- 
panied by the organ and Held's mili- 
tary band, rendered, "Gather Round the 
Standard Bearer." 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der John B. Maiben, and as the audi- 
ence dispersed Prof. Jos. J. Daynes ren- 
dered selections on the grand organ.

OPENING REMARKS , 

Brethren and sisters, at the com- 
mencement of this Semi-Annual Con- 
ference I wish to say a few words. I 
suppose that many of the audience 
now before me have come from a long 
distance to meet with us in 'this gen- 
eral conference; and that all have been 
moved to gather here by pure motives 
-by a desire to improve and perfect 
themselves in matters that pertain to 
their usefulness in the kingdom of God. 
In order that we may not be disap- 
pointed in this, it becomes necessary 
that we prepare our hearts to receive 
and profit by the suggestions that 
may be made by the speakers during 
the progress of the Conference, which 
may be prompted by the Spirit of the 
Lord. I have thought, and still think, 
that our being edified does not so much 
depend upon the speaker as upon our- 
selves. When we come together on 
occasions like this we are entitled to 



2 GENERAL C 

leceive something that will he of great 
importance to us in our lives. We 
ought to understand— and I presume 
that we do generally— that the work 
which we have come into this life to 
perform cannot be dene to the glory 
of God or to the satisfaction of our- 
selves merely by our own natural in- 
telligence. We are dependent upon the 
Spirit of the Lord to aid us and to 
manifest to us from time to time what 
is necessary for us to accomplish un- 
der the peculiar circumstances that 
may surround us. It is the privilege 
of Latter-day Saints, when they get 
into difficulties, to have supernatural 
power of God, and in faith, day by 
day; to secure from the circumstances 
which may surround us that which will 
be beneficial and advance us in the 
principles of holiness and sanctifica- 
tion, that we may as far as possible 
be like our Father. It certainly is 
possible to advance ourselves toward 
the . perfections of the Almighty to a 
very considerable extent, to say the 
least In fact, we are commanded to 
be perfect, even as our Father in 
heaven is perfect. From everything 
that arises, whether if be of a dis- 
agreeable nature or of a pleasant 
character, we should derive informa- 
tion and secure power to serve our- 
selves in the path of exaltation and 
glory over which we are moving. I 
know that we should never have been 
able to endure the severe trials that 
we have experienced during the past 
few years, had we not been gradually 
educated in times past and prepared 
to struggle with difficulties as we 
passed along. 

I desire to suggest to the Latter-day 
Saints this morning that they should 
not lose sight of the object which has 
prompted us to gather ourselves to- 
gether, that we may not return to our 
homes without having received lessons 
of encouragement to assist us in the 
surrounding difficulties. It is impos- 
sible for Latter-dav Saints to move 
along in the path of glory we are now 
treading unless they devote them- 
selves fully and wholly to the work 
and make the preparation which is ab- 
solutely necessary to meet and over- 



OhFERENCE 

come the temptations that might other- 
wise overpower us. Here, I suppose, 
are brethren and sisters who hold im- 
portant positions in the Church and 
have most solemn and pleasing duties 
to perform, and it is their ardent de- 
sire that they may be properly quali- 
fied to discharge these sacred duties 
satisfactorily to themselves and in a 
way that shall promote the interests 
of those they preside over. 

There is something grand in the con- 
sideration of the fact that the Lord 
loves us with a most ardent love. The 
love that a woman exercises toward 
her offspring cannot equal the love 
that God exercises towards us. He 
never leaves us. He is alw T ays before 
us, and upon our right hand and our 
left hand. Continually He watches 
over us. The antideluvians rejected 
the Lord in their day. The message 
which He sent to them was of the 
highest importance. Upon their ac- 
ceptance of the message depend- 
ed their temporal and spiritual 
salvation. But they rejected 
it. When the Lord communi- 
cates to man that which pertains to 
his most important i!it°rests, it is a 
solemn and serious thing ft v him to 
reject so direct a message. liut the 
antideluvians rejected the message.even 
the fullness of the Gospel, as it is now 
preached to us. If they had then em- 
braced (he opportunity thv.y migiiL 
have received the fullness of the Gos- 
pel and been prepared, when Christ was 
crucified and arose from the dead, to 
receive through the resurrection of their 
glorious bodies, free from /disease and 
corruption — the most glorious object 
that ever man set his mind upon. 
Those people failed to embrace that 
opportunity; but the Lord did not fail 
to love them and to have regard for 
them, and He gave them another op- 
portunity, although it was about two 
thousand five hundred years after- 
wards. After Jesus was crucified, He 
went and visited that people and gave 
them the opportunity of receiving that 
which they rejected when Noah pro- 
claimed to them the principles of 
spiritual and temporal salvation. 
Now, in some respects we differ from 



■

any other class of people. Opportuni- 
ties are before us which are not before 
them, though at some future time they 
will have the same opportunities as 
we have received and acted upon. But 
our prospects are different from their 
prospects; things are required at our 
hands which are not required of them; 
and there could not be placed before 
men more glorious prospects than are 
placed before the Saints. No mortal 
man could wish anything greater or 
that will ultimately prove more satis- 
factory. Everything that pertains to 
perfect peace, happiness, glory and ex- 
altation is before the Latter-day Saints. 
We should enjoy the spirit of this, and 
keep it actively before us. We should 
not let our prospects be darkened in 
the least by doing that which is not 
acceptable before the Lord. 

Brethren and sisters, I pray that the 
Lord may be with us during this Con- 
ference; that He may be with those 
who address you, and especially with 
you, that you may receive and com- 
prehend some principle or some sug- 
gestion that will be of the most sacred 
importance to you. 

The brethren will now address you, 
and through the exercise of your faith 
you will be greatly and abundantly 
blessed; which may God grant, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 
Condition of missionary fields— Preparation for the 

ministry — Relating to immigration— Providing 

employment— efficacy of faith. 

The six months that have passed 
since our last General Conference was 
held here have not been particularly 
fruitful in changes in the missionary 
field, or in any other direction, except- 
ing the loss of our beloved President. 
The Elders have been blessed in their 
labors in all the countries where they 
are endeavoring to propagate the Gos- 
pel, and more have returned from their 
fields than the number of those who 
have gone. We have, therefore, a 
smaller number of Elders now in the 
various fields than we had at our last 
Conference. There is one thing that 
has been noticed in the reports that 



have come from the fields, and that is, 
there is more diligence on the part of 
the missionaries and a better class of 
work is being done. There has been 
more care taken in sending out mis- 
sionaries; more strictness observed to 
have men go out who would not bring 
discredit to the name of Latter-day 
Saint by their indiscretions or by their 
lack of faithfulness. It may be said, I 
think, truthfully, that the standard is 
being raised. Our young men are en- 
tering more into the spirit of the work, 
and are seeking to qualify themselves 
in a manner that will be more accepta- 
ble to the Lord and more satisfactory 
to their fellow servants. There is 
plenty of room for improvement in 
this respect. There was a time- 
probably many of you can remember — 
when if a man were called on a mission 
it was frequently asked what he had 
done that he should be called On a 
mission. But now the question is asked, 
if a man is eligible and not called, 
"What have I done that I should not 
be called to go and preach the Gos- 
pel?" I think that is the rule at the 
present time among the Saints through- 
out Zion. It is looked upon as an 
honor to go out and preach the Gospel. 
I was talking to several strangers last 
night, and we were conversing about 
our sending out missionaries, and how 
quickly they responded to the call. I 
remarked that a young man was al- 
ways looked upon more favorably by 
the gentler sex if he were called on a 
mission than he would be if he were 
not called. I believe this is true. I 
believe the girls among us look with 
favor upon the young men who are 
called to go on missions, and they feel 
that their lovers are slighted if they 
are not called when they are at the 
proper age; and if they marry, they 
feel as though their husbands are not 
taken notice of as they should be if 
they are not called. This is a good 
spirit and feeling. 

We want our young men to qualify 
themselves for this labor. Education 
is easily procured now. There was a 
time, in the early days, when educa- 
tion was not common— that is, it was 
net uncommon for very able men to 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



have but meager education. This was 
the case with the first and most promi- 
nent Elders in the Church. But all 
this has changed. In those days, if a 
man were not educated it did not at- 
tract much attention, for the reason 
that education was not general— that 
is, higher education; but now, through 
the increase of colleges and universities 
and educational facilities, it is rather 
discreditable to a man not to be edu- 
cated, because education is within the 
reach of all. Therefore, our young- 
men who "go on missions should bear 
this in mind and should endeavor to 
qualify themselves for their missions. 
There is no reason why we should be 
behind any people in this respect. It 
should be a stimulus to our young 
men to seek for education and to 
qualify themselves, when they know 
that this is the feeling and the opinion 
of the world concerning men who go 
forth as ministers of the Gospel. But 
a great many lose their faith because 
they do not understand how to avail 
themselves of the advantages which 
they have. This is especially so in re- 
gard to college education. Our young 
men who go away to get education 
come back in many instances with their 
faith weakened, because they do not 
revere the principles of the Gospel and 
hold fast to them as immutable truths. 
But, notwithstanding these drawbacks, 
I am sure we are all gratified at the 
progress that is being made by our 
young people, and I hope it will con- 
tinue. Some perhaps may not use 
their education aright, and may have 
their faith weakened; but this is not 
the case generally, and I trust will not 
be the case, but that our young people 
will learn to obtain higher education 
without becoming imbued with the be- 
lief and the skepticism that prevails 
in the world. 

Our Elders among the nations have 
been very successful, the Lord, is bless- 
ing them, tnd great progress is being 
made in various directions. We are 
warning the people, and we are bring- 
ing the honest in heart to a knowl- 
edge of the truth. There is one course 
that has been taken which I think 
will be att^rded with good effects, that 



is, counseling the Saints in the various 
lands where they embrace the Gospel 
to remain quiet for awhile; to not be 
anxious to break up their homes to 
gather to Zion. This counsel is being 
given by the Elders now in various 
lands, and it will be attended with ex- 
cellent effects, because the converts 
will be accustomed to the principles 
of the Gospel, and acquainted with the 
circumstances which surround the 
people, and more familiar with thi 
trials they may . have to meet. Their 
faith will become stronger, and they 
will be better able to withstand the 
trials and difficulties they will have to 
contend with when they do emigrate 
to Zion. Most of you know how this 
operates. A man that is new in the 
Church and has no experience is not 
in a position to resist trials that he 
could subsequently. By having the 
Saints remain in the places where 
they dwell they gain experience and 
strength. Besides this, they are 
able to help the Elders, and the Elders 
do not find it so difficult to preach the 
Gospel, because they have the support 
and the assistance of those who are 
members of the Church and who live 
in organized branches of the Church. 
I am sure that we will see the good 
effects of this. We shall not have so 
many spending means and time to come 
here, and then apostatizing, and be- 
coming tired and desiring to return 
again to where they came from. This 
effect, I am sure, will be noticeable 
throughout the wards and Stakes of 
Zion. 

In our own land the Lord has been 
very kind to us. He has prospered us. 
He has given us good crops, and the 
people are in better circumstances, 
speaking generally, than they were a 
year ago. And He will continue to 
bless us. There is one thing that we 
should attend to as a people, and that 
is, diversify our pursuits. Our cities 
should not be crowded with unem- 
ployed men. There is plenty of op- 
portunity in this State for men to 
work out for themselves a subsistence. 
I often think of how it was when the 
people landed here in the beginning. 
They had but very little to eat, 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON.

very little clothing, and but few tools; 
but they came on this" ground, and 
they built themselves houses — such as 
they were — and they turned in and 
cultivated the soil, to raise their food, 
and they succeeded without anyone 
but the Lord to help them. If our 
brethren who are unemployed would 
ask those who have had experience, 
they could tell them how to make a 
living without expecting somebody to 
feed them or to furnish them with 
that which they need. It is wrong for 
them to walk around unemployed. In 
the spring of the year, if they have 
not some other employment, they 
should get a piece of land (there are 
plenty of people who would let them 
have a piece on some terms) and raise 
their own food, or try to raise it. Have 
somebody teach them how to do it, if 
they do not know themselves. Our 
people are willing to assist the in- 
dustrious and the persevering. None 
need go short. There is plenty of 
room on every hand. You need not 
go out of the State of Utah; there is 
land in abundance to be obtained here, 
and obtained easily; and if we can get 
land and are healthy, every man ought 
to be able to sustain himself and his 
family. There is no reason why he 
should not. Our young men should 
not be contented to be looking around 
for somebody to give them employ- 
ment. Every man should seek to be 
able to employ himself, and not be 
hanging around stores and offices ask- 
ing for somebody to give him em- 
ployment. Let him strike out for 
himself, and make a living for himself. 
He can do it in this country. There 
are plenty of facilities for every young 
man. There is no need to go to Cali- 
fornia, Montana, or to the mines; go 
to some place in the State and build 
the State up, build up Zion, and take 
example from those who have pre- 
ceded us, who have shown what can 
be done in building up a commonwealth 
and making a rich people. For, not - 
withstanding our difficulties, we are a 
comparatively rich people. 

I alluded to a conversation 
I had last evening With 
some gentlemen. Another thing 



I mentioned comes to my mind, and 
when it was told wonder was expressed 
how we could do it. I related how 
years ago, before the railroad was 
completed, we sent down every year 
for several years 500 teams, 500 team- 
sters, and guards, and loaded those 
teams with provisions to feed the 
poor, whom the teams brought up, and 
also to feed the teamsters. This was 
done by the Latter-day Saints. Thou- 
sands of people were brought into this 
country in this way. Now, we did 
not think that was very heavy. I never 
heard, that I know of, a murmur from 
anybody respecting this labor. Just 
think of the cost of it! The hiring 
of 500 teams for the summer (it was 
practically a whole year's work), 500 
men and guards, and then the pro- 
visions to feed the people who were 
brought from the Missouri up here. 
We can do great works if we are 
united and have faith. But where 
people have no faith, and they say, "I 
cannot," "It is too much." They 
ought to feel that they can do anything 
that is right. We as a people can do 
anything the Lord requires of us. We 
ought to have faith in these directions. 
But we fall into the ways of the world 
and into thinking as they do. Why, 
if we do that, we become a common- 
place people, of no value particularly. 
The strength of the Latter-day Saints 
is their faith. By that they can ac- 
complish anything they set their 
hearts to do if it is right. God will 
be with them and sustain them. He 
has done it all the time. We have 
accomplished apparent impossibilities 
through the power and blessing of God 
and the faith of the people. If we 
have faith we can accomplish all 
things that are required at our hands. 
We should not say, "I cannot do it" — 
"it is too much for us." That ought 
not to be the feeling of a Latter-day 
Saint. We can preach the Gospel, we 
can gather the people, we can build 
temples, we can build houses of wor- 
ship, and we can do everything that 
is required of us, by the principle of 
faith, actively exhibited in works. 
But the feeling that has been growing 
among us is to drop on somebody else 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for them to help us. You would be 
surprised to know how many there are 
who come and want the Church to 
help them. They pile on to the 
Church, and forget that the leaders of 
the Church have to exercise faith 
themselves. If they get into a close 
place instead of going to God and 
asking Him to help them, and having 
faith that God is able to assist them 
in carrying their loads and open the 
way before them, they must come to 
the Church. "Cannot the Trustee- 
in-Trust help me do this?" They can- 
not build meeting houses; they cannot 
do this or the other; it is too much 
for them; and they want the Church 
to help them. Well, it is a wrong 
feeling. We should seek to help our- 
selves, and to call upon God, who is as 
near the individuals in the settlements 
as He is to us. He is as willing to 
listen to the prayers of an Elder in 
the remotest parts of the earth as He 
is in Zion. He is willing to hear all 
our cries, if we have faith. I tell you, 
my brethren and sisters, we must cul- 
tivate this faith and this confidence in 
God. One reason, I believe, that the 
Lord has required the Elders to go 
without purse or scrip is that we may 
have faith developed in the earth, that 
the Elders shall come back filled with 
faith. Why? Because God has heard 
and answered their prayers in the 
utmost extremity. When they have 
been in the greatest difficulty and it 
has seemed impossible for them to get 
relief, the Lord has heard their prayers. 
These men, returning by hundreds as 
they are, ought to have faith and to 
increase faith throughout the entire 
community. There is no doubt they 
do have a good effect. This communi- 
ty is being elevated by this kind of 
training. But there is still plenty of 
room for us to cultivate faith, and not 
imagine that we must fall on the 
Church for everything that we need or 
that we have difficulty In accomplishing. 
The Trustee-in-Trust cannot respond 
to all the calls. There is not means 
enough at his command. Therefore, 
we should seek individually to do our 
part towards this work. It should be 
our pleasure to labor for Zion in every 



direction ar^| to the utmost of our 
power. There is no labor on the 
earth so pleasurable as laboring for 
Zion, whether in the ministerial field 
or at home in any field that may be 
assigned us. There is no greater work, 
and no work that God smiles upon and 
blesses as He does that. The man 
that does it is a happy man, and will 
be a happy man, who labors for Zion 
with singleness of purpose and with his 
heart devoted to the work of the Lord. 
God bless you, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER MATHIAS F. COWLEY. 

Guidance ot the Holy Spirit — Perpetuity of the 
Church — Divine authority of the Priesthood — The 
power of Faith — Necessity of strictness in the 
payment of Tithing. 

My Brethren and Sisters: I am grati- 
fied for the privilege of meecing with 
you at this Conference, and I desire, in 
performing my duty, to enjoy the sug- 
gestions of the Holy Spirit. The object, 
as I understand it, of our general con- 
ferences,, and proportionately the Stake 
and ward conferences of the Church, is 
that we may be strengthened in our 
faith, that we may be encouraged in the 
performance of our duties. 

There is no question of greaiter im- 
portance than the one which every man 
and woman should ask himself or her- 
self personally: 'Am I doing my duty 
as a Latter-day Saint?" Am I living in 
strict harmony with the sacred coven- 
ants which I have made witn the Lord? 
If I am there is a testimony in my 
heart that the Lord is pleased with me, 
and if I am not there is a testimony 
that I am not as acceptable as I should 
be." And if any one who is not doing 
his full duty is not chided by the Holy 
Spirit, he is in a dangerous condition, 
for he has deadened the influence of the 
power within him. 

I have been impressed so many times 
that it almost seems to be a hobby in 
my own mind, by the statement that 
President Woodruff made to us on sev- 
eral occasions; I think not only in this 
tabernacle but in other places through- 
out the Church, and possibly in his 
writings; that President Brigham 
Young appeared to him on a certain 
occasion, I believe it was when he was 



ELDER MATH IAS F. COWLEY. 



in exile' in Arizona. President Woodruff 
was on hi's way to attend a conference 
and the departed Prophet presented 
himself to this living' Apostle, in the 
flesh, and President Woodruff asked 
him: "Are you going to attend confer- 
ence with us, President Young? and will 
you address us on the occasion ?" 'Presi- 
dent Toung replied to him: "Brother 
Woodruff, I have done my talking in 
the flesh; that remains for you to do; 
hut there is one thing I want you to do 
and to impress upon the minds of the 
Latter-day Saints, and that is to tell 
them to get the spirit of God and keep 
it with them." This sounds a little pe- 
culiar because it is the common injunc- 
tion that is laid down in the Scriptures, 
that has been written in the revelations 
of God in every dispensation and has 
been uttered by every Prophet, and for 
that matter it has been urged by every 
faithful Elder in his ministration, ana 
by every faithful Bishop of the Church, 
and every president of a Stake, to 
seek for the guidance of the Holy 
Spirit, and to cultivate it that it may be 
unto us a constant companion. Con- 
sidering this it would seem a little pecu- 
liar that a departed Prophet of God 
should come to a living Prophet and tell 
such an apparently common message. 
But it is not common; it is the import- 
ant key-note to everything in this 
Church. When the Latter-day Saints 
first heard the sound of the Gospel in 
their native lands, they were led to re- 

a* 

ceive it with joy and satisfaction, but 
they were unacquainted with the whis- 
perings of the Holy Spirit. It had been 
taught for many generations that the 
living Spirit of God as it was enjoyed 
in the ministrations of the Savior and 
his Apostles in the land of Palestine 
during their ministrations on the earth, 
was not to be expected in this enlight- 
ened age; and that the conditions Which 
were associated with the various dis- 
pensations of the Gospel committed to 
man from the time of Adam down to 
the present day, the conditions asso- 
ciated with the enjoyment of the spirit 
of revelation to guide every man and 
woman that should embrace the Gos- 
pel, were not to be expected in 
the nineteenth century. And con- 
sequently when the Gospel was 
restored to the earth, and the 



Eiders went forth declaring the same, 
it was a matter of astonishment to 
those who heard it and who did not 
have the spirit to receive it, and were 
not looking for such a message; but 
the hearts of those who received the 
Gospel had been, in most instances, 
prepared for it. They were looking for 
such a message. Their hearts were 
filled with joy and pleasure when they 
embraced the Gospel. They received 
a living testimony for themselves. 
That testimony was not con- 
fined to the Prophet Joseph Smith, nor 
to his immediate associates. It was not 
confined to any council or quorum in 
the holy Priesthood, but the promise 
was universal; that whosoever -would 
receive the Gospel might not only re- 
ceive a remission of their sins, but also 
a living testimony of the Holy 
Spirit; they should know that God had 
spoken from the heavens; they should 
receive a witness that their sins had 
been remitted; and when this testimony 
came to those who embraced it, what 
joy, wlhat satisfaction it produced in 
their hearts! And during all the his- 
tory 'Of 'tlhis Church, now sixty- 
eight and one-half years in 
this dispensation, it fis so organized 
and, in the purposes of God, is so de- 
signed as to perpetuate itself. Men 
have passed away; the Prophet of God 
and his brother, Hyrum, who stood by 
him in all the trials and tribulations 
of life, and who was also a Prophet of 
the living God, they laid down their 
lives; they sealed their testimony with 
their blood; but the work did not die 
with them. The Lord had organized the 
Church in such a way that when the 
Presidency was dissolved by the death 
of the Prophet, Twelve Apostles should 
preside over the Church, until the 
Presidency should be organized again; 
and so this organization has been per- 
petuated on the earth; and when men 
have been called to positions, they have 
been called by the spirit of revelation 
from God, just as literally, and just as 
distinctly as those that Paul spoke of 
in the 13th chapter of the Acts of the 
Apostlles. When the Apostles were as- 
sembled and considering the appoint- 
ment of Elders to laibor (in the minis- 
try, and as they fasted, the Hoiy Ghost 
said unto them: "Separate unto me 



8 GENERAL 

Barnabas and Saul for the work where 
unlto I have called them." And they 
were called by the Spirit of revelation, 
and by the laying on of hands by those 
who had been called of God 
to administer in His name 
in the flesh; and this is the 
only way that the work of 
the Lord has ever been per- 
petuated in the earth in any 
dispensation of the Gospel. It was so 
■in the days of Moses, who had received 
the higher Priesthood, which holds the 
keys otf receiving revelations from God 
far the government of His affairs 
among the children of men, and With- 
out which Priesthood, the Lord has said 
the power of Godliness is not manifest 
unto men in the flesh. But Moses 
honored this Priesthood, and he sought 
to sanctify all his people, just as the 
Prophet Joseph and hlis successors have 
sought to sanctify the Latter-day 
Saints, that they might come to a high- 
er standard in the enjoyment of the 
Gospel, and the authority and power 
of the holy Priesthood. He sought to 
sanctify them that they rmight have the 
the manifestations of the glory of God, 
and he sought to promote them to that 
standard, but when he wenlt up to com- 
mune with tlhe Lord on Mount 
Sinai, he had to draw a boundary Mne, 
and say to them that they should not 
pass over it because of their unworthl- 
ness; and he went up and communed 
with the Lord, and he received the 
mind and will of the«Lord; and when he 
came dawn to communicate it to the 
House of Israeli, they could not look 
upon his eountenace, because it shone 
with the Spirit of God— it shone with 
that power of Godliness which was re- 
flected through the Priesthood which 
the Prophet Moses held; but they could 
not be sanctified, far the reason that 
they rejected the higher Jaw of the 
Gospel, which had been delivered to the 
Prophet Mioses and through which he 
sought to sanctify them. As they were 
unworthy to continue in these higher 
blessings the Lord decreed that they 
should continue in the ordinances of the 
Lesser Priesthood-the administration of 
sacrifices, symbolical of the sacrifice of 
the Son of God for the redemption of 
mankind. He was called to do that 
work; to stand at the head of the 
House of Israel; a man that was called 
of God by revelation--a, man that had 
been faithful. 



CONFERENCE 

Joshua, the son of Nun, was always 
inspired with that faith in God spoken 
of this morning by President Cannon. 
He did not stagger at the command of 
God, or at the purposes of the Al- 
mighty in designing the plan for en- 
tering into the land which had 
been promised to Abraham and his seed 
after him for an everlasting posses- 
sion. You may read in the later chap- 
ters of iDeuteronomy how Joshua was 
called. The Lord said unto Moses: 
"Take unto thee Joshua, the son of 
Nun, in whom is the spirit of wisdom, 
and lay thine hand upon him." He was 
called of God by revelation, and was 
oirdained to stand 'at the head of the 
House of Israel and to preside in the 
admlinistratdon of those ordinances 
which were symbolical of the atone- 
ment of the Savior, and which con- 
tinued in Israel until the coming of the 
Son of God, who' introduced the Gospel 
again in i'ts fulness and restored the 
higher Priesthood. 

The work of God in this generation 
has been established just as literally 
as it was anciently. The brethren who 
have been called to preside over this 
Church have been selected by the 
Spirit of revelation, and it has been 
manifest very strikingly af late in the 
calling of President Lorenzo Snow, 
and of brethren to preside over mis- 
sions. Brethren have communed with 
the Lord; they have sought the mind 
and will of the Lord to know 'about 
these matters, and they have received 
it by the (Spirit of revelation. I want 
to bear my testimony concerning the 
principle of faith. We do not have it as 
we o'ught to have it; it is not exempli- 
fied in our lives as it ought to be; we 
ought to have the faith that character- 
ized Nephi, when he was sent to ob- 
tain the. plates af Lalban, and when his 
brethren staggered af the thought of 
their going to face the probable danger 
of performing that duty which had 
been assigned to them by their father, 
or by the Lord through their father, 
the Prophet Nephi said unto them: 
"The Lord, God, giveth no command- 
ment unto the children of men, save 
that He will prepare a way for them 
to accomplish the thing which He 
commandebh them." That statement, 
enunciated by the Prophet Nephi, is 
as true today as it was then. The evi- 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLED.

dences oif the truth of this work are 
stamped upon the mind (by the exercise 
of the principle of faith. We may not 
be able to coimmunicate by mere ver- 
bal statement or by letter the Spirit 
and testimony of this work, but it is as 
tangible to us as it is to the human 
body when you receive a shock of elec- 
tricity. You cannot describe the sensa- 
tion so that others can feel it and 
understand it; they must have the cur- 
rent of electricity turned into their own 
souls in order to understand it. It is 
just as possible to receive a testimony 
of the divinity oif this work as it is 
tangible to the human body to be 
shocked wiibh electricity. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in 
the labors of the Elders abroad. I re- 
joice when I see them returning with a 
good report, having been schooled in 
that experience which oan be obtained 
alone by tihe exercise of faith in God 
by going forth, without money and 
without price, to declare the Gospel 
unto the nations of the earth. Educa- 
tion is not alone to be olbtained from 
books and in universities, col- 
leges and in seminaries of learning. 
There is an education that comes 
through the revelations of the Spirit 
of God to man that is higher than 
every other class of education, and 
compared with which all other systems 
of education sink into insignificance. 
What do we know about the earth even 
upon which we stand? What do we 
know albonxt the planets that roll in 
space? Very little; (but when the time 
comes, we will receive a know- 
ledge of these things by revelation from 
God— when these sciences will be writ- 
ten upon by the Spirit of revelation 
resting upon men of God— men who 
exalt the Lord above all else. These 
things will be revealed from heaven, 
and we will understand them in their 
true light, and we will understand 
them perfectly. 

I exhort you to pray to God for His 
spirit; strive to keep it with you; the 
only way to do that is to do your sim- 
ple duty. There is nothing so import- 
ant as the simple duty of the hour — 
that is the duty of the Latter-day 
Saints.. It is their duty to nave family 
prayer in the evening, and to call God 
into their midst. They should teach their 



posterity to pray; teach them to ask a 
blessing on their food. It is the duty of 
every Latter-day Saint to pay his tith- 
ing and to pay it fully, not to make a 
feeble attempt at it by paying one- 
half, or one-fifth, or four fiftns, but by 
paying his full one- tenth of his inter- 
est annually. If it is not one-tenth, it 
is not thoroughly and completely tith- 
ing. When you baptize a man in water, 
if you do it with his right hand not 
immersed, the Elder on the bank in 
charge, requests the one administer- 
ing to do it over again, and immerse 
the whole body in the water, that it 
may be truly a baptism for the remis- 
sion of sins, in similitude of the resur- 
rection of the Son of God. As Latter- 
day Saints, we ought to be just as 
thorough in the performance of our 
duties, our simple duties in the Gospel, 
our prayers, our thanks, our offerings, 
our attention to the Priesthood of God 
in complying with the calls to carry 
the Gospel abroad, or to labor at home, 
as a merchant is in looking after the 
interests of his establishment. If we 
were so, the spirit of the Lord would 
be more abundantly poured out upon 
this people. There would be more liv- 
ing witnesses by their experiences of 
the power of God among the people 
than there are. I want to bear my testi- 
mony that no man or woman ever gets 
tired of paying tithing so long as they 
observe these simple duties. It is one 
of the grandest testimonies to the 
truth of this work, that no man who 
conscientiously lives it, who reflects 
and studies upon it according to the 
best opportunities, and time and abil- 
ity that he has, ever tires of what the 
world call "Mormonism;" but when 
you find a man that has fallen by the 
wayside, you can trace in his course 
the neglect of some duty or the viola- 
tion of some covenant which he has 
made with his God. 

May God bless us, my brethren 
sisters, and enable us to live nearer t" 
him and keep His commandments more 
strictly in all respects, that we may 
enjoy the spirit of the Priesthood and 
the spirit and power which belongs to 
this work; I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen.

ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 

Missionary work in the Orient— Opposition encoun- 
tered— Changes in Palestine — An American 
Colony, 

I hope that I may be in possession of 
the same spirit that inspired our 
brethren who addressed us this morning 
I feel happy to be in your midst, to 
see so many faces, happy faces, of the 
Latter-day Saints as I see here before 
me today. 

When you last met in general Con- 
ference, 1 did not have the pleasure to 
be with you, as I was then laboring 
among the Saints in the Orient. I had a 
very interesting mission 'to that part of 
the earth. As you know, we have a 
number of Saints in the Turkish em- 
pire. During the massacres which oc- 
curred in Armenia a few years ago, our 
brethren and sisters there w^re left 
without any Elders from Zion to pre- 
side over them. The Presidency of the 
Church sent Brother Hintze and myself 
over there last December to organize 
the Church more fully. We found that 
the Saints there, though left without 
Elders from Zion to preside over them, 
had not lost the spirit of the work. It 
is quite a testimony to me that the 
Spirit of God works the same, makes 
the same manifestations wherever it is 
enjoyed. The Saints there enjoy the 



spirit of the Gospel, rejoice in that 
which they have received, and the 
Spirit had led them to a right under- 
standing. I was pleased to see them so 
well grounded in the principles of the 
Gospel, especially when I thought of 
their not having access to any of our 
Church works. Only a few of the Saints 
were able to read English, and we have 
not yet any of our Church works trans- 
lated into Turkish. A few tracts have 
been published, but the works of the 
Church have not yet been translated 
into that language and consequently 
our brethren and sisters there have 
not been able to read our accepted 
works except the Bible, nor any of 
our published sermons; and still we 
found them in full accord with the be- 
lief and faith of the Church, showing 
that the Spirit of God leads into all 
truth. They were very happy to have 
us come and visit them. We found quite 
a number ready to receive the Gospel, 
and had the joy of leading quite a num- 
ber into the waters of baptism. Some 
had been baptized, but for the want of 
an Elder had not been confirmed mem- 
bers. They were glad to receive 'this 
blessing. We organized a branch of the 
Church at Aintab. I do not 
think that such a condition will again 
arise there, as that of the Saints of the 
largest branch being left under the 
presidency of a Priest only. We found 
brethren there worthy of presiding, 
worthy of the Priesthood, and ordained 
them. 

We also found that our adversary 
was not pleased with our work, nor 
with the work of the Saints. Persecu- 
tion was raised against the Saints there, 
the mob disturbed some of our meet- 
ings, but the Lord was with us; none 
was hurt, and it caused more Of a spirit 
of inquiry amongst the people. The 
government and the officers of the gov- 
ernment were friendly to us and prom- 
ised us protection. I found that it was 
mostly members belonging to different 
Christian denominations which raised 
this persecution against our people. The 
Turks themselves did not act in any' 
way unfriendly towards us. They won- 
dered what all this turmoil was about, 
and came to us and wanted to know 
What we really believed. While the 
Turkish government is not one that an

American would like to live under, still 
it gives greater religious liberty to our 
Saints than they would be permitted to 
enjoy in countries like Greece, Italy, or 
Spain. The Mohammedans do not in- 
terfere with our brethren in the exer- 
cise of their religion, or forbid them to 
believe as they desire, but give freedom 
to worship God according to the dic- 
tates of their conscience. I may qualify 
this by saying that the Mohammedans 
themselves do not enjoy this freedom 
to the same extent as the Christians. If 
a Mohammedan should leave his re- 
ligion and join any other religion in that 
land, he would be ostracised from the 
society of his relatives and friends, and 
would be in danger even of his life. But 
as to the Christians, the Mohammedans 
are willing that they do as they please 
in regard to their religion, and I be- 
lieve the more contention they see 
amongst the Christians the more they 
like it. 

When persecution was raised against 
us, the Saints were desirous of our ap- 
pealing to the government for help, 
but on second thought we felt that this 
would not be wise. We did not like to 
raise strife between the Mohammedans 
and the Christians. It is not a long 
time since a great many Christians lost 
their lives in Armenia, and we were 
afraid that we might be the 
cause of starting this race 
hatred between the two parties, 
and we thought it would be better to 
suffer a little wrong than to be the 
cause of wrong being done. I told the 
Saints that I did not think the perse- 
cution would amount to much, and I 
knew that the Lord was able to protect 
His Saints. 

Wherever the Gospel has been intro- 
duced it has always met with opposi- 
tion. The Turkish mayor of Aintab 
said to me, when I asked him to look 
after our people, that they should not 
suffer any wrong at the hands of their 
enemies, "Wherever a message of 
truth is sent, those bearing it will suf- 
fer persecution." I knew the sentiment 
was true, but it sounded curious to 
hear it from his lips. He promised 
to protect the 'Saints, and I learn from 
them that he has fined some of the 
mobocrats. 



I believe there is a great future for 
our people in that land; and that there 
are many of the honest in heart, and I 
hope our brethren will find them. They 
love to hear the Gospel. They love 
the truth, and when they receive it 
they enjoy the Spirit, and the signs fol- 
low them that believe, even in that far 
off land. 

In company with- Elders Hintze, May- 
cock, Larson and Nishan, the latter a 
native Elder, I visited the Holy Land, 
and traveled over the places so famil- 
iar and so interesting to us from read- 
ing the Scriptures. We examined the 
country and the conditions existing 
there carefully with a view of finding 
a place of gathering for the Saints. 

You remember that in the forties 
Apostle Orson Hyde was sent to that 
land, and that he dedicated it unto 
the Lord, and for the gathering of the 
Jews. That land had been cursed on 
account of the iniquity of its people, 
and for hundreds of years it has been 
a testimony to the world that the Lord 
honors the words of his •servants, the 
words spoken by the inspiration of His 
Spirit. Moses, thousands of years ago, 
was permitted to see the future and 
prophesied concerning it, warning the 
people of Israel that if they did not 
obey the commandments of God they 
should be scattered amongst the na- 
tions of the earth. You who have read 
history know how literally this proph- 
ecy has been fulfilled, and that the land 
given to Abraham and his seed has 
been occupied by strangers, and that 
the blessings of God which once made 
that land a delightful place in which 
to dwell, were withdrawn and it was 
turned into a barren and forbidding 
land. Brother Hyde went there and 
blessed it. The mission given to the 
servants of God was to pro- 
claim the Gospel to the Gentiles first 
and then to the Jews. This was declared 
very early by the Lord as the mission 
given to His servants. His chosen peo- 
ple were not forgotten. They, also, 
should receive the Gospel message; but 
this time the first should be the last. 
The Prophet Joseph was inspired to 
send Brother Hyde to that land, and 
look at the change! A spirit has come 
over the Jews, over the House of Israel, 
to gather to that land. This was not 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



felt by them before 'but since that time. 

This spirit has come upon them in 
whatever part of the earth they dwell, 
We found in traveling- in that land 
whole settlements of Jews who have 
gathered there of late years. In talk- 
ing with them (Brother Hintze being 
a'ble to talk the language) we learned 
that they were not gathering in faith; 
it was not because they believed that 
the Lord had opened the way before 
them, but they had a desire to go there. 
A learned Jewish doctor told us that 
his people wanted to become again a 
nation. They longed to be once more a 
people upon the earth, and 'to own the 
land given to their fathers. 

In Jerusalem we found quite an in- 
crease in the number of the Jews; dur- 
ing the last three years, fifteen thou- 
sand had settled there. The sultan is not 
pleased with this and has prohibited 
the Jews from emigrating into Pales- 
tine, but still the movement is going on, 
the Zion movement among the people of 
Israel, and they are looking forward to 
inhabiting that land. It is one of the 
signs of the times. Before long I believe 
the Lord will touch the hearts of that 
people and they will believe in Jesus 
as their Messiah. The Book of Mormon 
has the prophecy that when they do be- 
lieve in Him that land shall be given 
them again as their inheritance. I do not 
believe that time is far distant. I believe 
that the time is hastening when the 
Lord will accomplish what he has 
spoken by His servants the Prophets. 

While in Jerusalem we met a colony 
of Americans. These people have been 
impressed that they live in the last days 
and that the coming of 'Christ is near, 
and so they have sold out their posses- 
sions, taken their means with them to 
Jerusalem that they might live there 
when Christ comes, •believing that He 
will come to Mount Olivet. 

We spent a very pleasant evening 
with them. They lived in the united 
order, having everything in common, 
and they use their time in doing good, 
in going to the sick and helping the 
poor. So far they are doing a good 
work. Mrs. Spofford, the president 
and leader of the society, told us that 
in studying the Scriptures they have 
come to the conclusion that Christ 
will soon appear, and she said: "We 



were struck very much by the proph- 
ecy uttered by Zachariah in the 14th 
chapter, 10th verse, and also by the 
prophecy of Jeremiah, concerning Je- 
rusalem, in the 31st chapter, in which 
it is foretold how the city of Jerusalem 
shall be built on certain lines. When 
reading the chapters closely we find 
that the time alluded to is the latter 
days, and it is said there that the city 
of Jerusalem should be built from the 
tower of Hananeel to the king's wine 
presses and from there to the valley 
of the dead bodies and of the ashes." 
She pointed out to us this fact, that 
the city is being built now exactly 
on these lines. They did not know at 
first where the tower of Hananeel was. 
Nobody seemed to know, and if you 
look into books giving descriptions of 
Jerusalem, that place is not designated, 
but a few years ago when they were 
digging the foundations of the Grand 
hotel in Jerusalem they discovered the 
foundations of a tower and among in- 
scriptions found was the name of Ha- 
naneel. This made them believe that 
this must have been the tower of Ha- 
naneel. Taking that for a starting 
point, and to the king's wine presses 
and down to the valley of ashes, Je- 
rusalem is being built as thus described 
These people took this to be one of the 
signs of the times. I take it to be one 
of the signs of the times, that God is 
working upon His people, His chosen 
people, and that they are gathering to 
that land. 

As for our people gathering there, we 
feel that our brethren should be well 
grounded in the faith before we move 
them, and still being in their infancy 
it would be better to strengthen, the 
branches and have more come into the 
Church, and then gradually gather 
them down to a place selected in the 
Holy Land, and this is a work that will 
be accomplished. There will be a 
Zion in the East as well as in the 
West, "for the law shall go forth out of 
Zion and the word of the Lord from. 
Jerusalem." 

Brethren and sisters, I delight in 
dwelling upon these things. I see the 
Lord is working with the nations. He 
is gradually accomplishing His pur- 
poses, and His work will grow in the 
earth, and all the opposition in the 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL.

world will not stop it. He has re- 
vealed His will to men. He has estab- 
lished His kingdom upon the earth, and 
it will grow until it becomes, as Da- 
niel saw, a kingdom that will fill the 
whole earth. 

May the Lord help us to be faithful 
and true and to have a share in His 
kingdom forever, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

An occasion for self-scrutiny— The labor committed 
to the Saints by the Lord— The Church the most 
perfect of all organizations— Local officers should 
be active and discreet— No unworthy person 
should be recommended to enter the holy Tem- 
ples—The great work for the dead. 

In arising before you, my brethren 
and sisters, I desire to make you hear 
the few words I may speak to you this 

afternoon. 

In looking over this congregation, I 
realize that we all have an object in 
view in coming to the Conference from 
distant parts, and as was observed this 
morning, perhaps a large majority of 
the congregation here today is from 
remote parts of the country. We are 
here to be instructed. We are here 
to listen to the voice of the Spirit of 
the Lord. We are here to have a re- 
freshing from the Lord in our assem- 
blings together during the Conference. 
It is 1 a good time to reflect, it is a good 
time to look over our history, that is 
our private history and our private life 
and the acts thereof. It is a good time 
to sit in judgment upon ourselves and 
judge ourselves as to our standing and 
fellowship with the Lord. The Lord 
has been very merciful to us, very 
merciful to the Latter-day Saints. We 
are constrained to acknowledge the 
hand of the Lord in/ His kind dealings 
with us in this mountain country. 

Those who have had a few years 
experience can see visibly that the ele- 
ments have been tempered. The earth 
has been blessed and sanctified for the 
good of the people, so much so that 
it produces in abundance to the husi- 
bandm'an; it rewards him for his toil; 
while but a short time ago it looked 
as though the country was a barren 
waste. But we find that the Lord has 
blessed the earth; has blessed the peo- 
ple; has multiplied them in the good 



things of the earth, so much so that 
all, or seemingly all, have all the boun- 
ties of the earth. 

The Lord has also given unto us the 
charge of His work in the earth; giv- 
en unto us the charge of organizing 
His people, to teach them the Gospel, 
and to send the Gospel to the distant 
parts of the earth, as we have been 
hearing this afternoon. This charge 
and labor has been committed to the 
Latter-day Saints, and we are obligat- 
ed to the- Lord to preach the Gospel 
in all the world, to every nation and 
to every people. This is the work 
that we have in hand; this is the 
labor that is marked out for us; 
and we come together from time 
to time at the conferences of the 
Church, and we usually hear from the 
brethren who are posted with regard to 
the spread of the work in other lands 
and in our own land, and we are led 
to exclaim: "Praise the Lord for His 
goodness and for His mercy and His 
long-suffering to us as His people." 

We have, my brethren and sisters and 
friends, a beautiful organization, corm 
plete in all its details, such as no other 
people has; such as was not in the wis- 
dom of man to give to the people. I 
often think about it, think about how 
we are situated, the circumstances un- 
der which we are placed. We are not 
left to depend upon ourselves, upon our 
judgment in matters of Interest that 
pertain to ourselves. We have been ad- 
vised to seek counsel of each other, to 
seek 'the counsels of the Lord. In the 
midst of counsel, it is .said, there is 
safety. I have thought sometimes 
that we did not appreciate this beau- 
tiful system that the Lord has revealed 
and made known to man under which 
we may live and have full fellowship 
with each other. I have thought, my 
'brethren and sisters, that if we were 
a little more careful, and should give 
a liftle more attention to the organiza- 
tion that we have, Lt would save us a 
great deal of trouble and also save our 
brelthren trouble. 

I have said that I thought it was a 
good thing, and I say it from experi- 
ence, for the authorities of a ward, the 
organizations of the Priesthood in a 
ward, to have their meetings frequent- 
ly. The Bishop in a ward should call his 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



brethren together, especially his coun- 
selors, and talk over the interests of the 
people there. Counsel together, call in 
others that have interest in the work of 
the Lord, and advise together about all 
matters relating to the interests and 
welfare of the people that live there. 
Old wards need this, and new wards 
also need ft — to know the condition of 
all of the people and to specially know 
the condition Of the young people, in 
this ward organization; and if it be 
found that there are matters of in- 
terest and problems that they cannot 
solve, then they may apply to 
the president of the Stake, and 
take him into their confidence and ap- 
ply to him for the counsels of the Lord; 
and if the problem is such that he 
can not solve it, then' there is another 
source that he may apply to and get 
the mind and will of the Lord on all 
matters relating to the interests, relat- 
ing to the welfare, relating to the es- 
tablishing of the people in the faith of 
the Gospel. We' want to encourage 
faith, as was said this morning; we 
want to instill that faith into our chil- 
dren and into the young people. I 
believe faith is increasing in the land, 
however, but we find it will be through 
our efforts, through our labors that 
faith will be increased in the minds of 
the people. 

I have had, in connection with others, 
some experience with people, young 
people especially, and middle-aged peo- 
ple, too, sometimes, who procure en- 
dorsements or recommends from the 
Bishop of their ward where they live, 
and I have been led to question wheth- 
er the Bishop knew much about the 
person that he recommended, if he was 
fully familiar with his life. Now this 
should not be. We ought to b e famil- 
iar with the affairs that are under our 
care and under our jurisdiction, and 
this can be brought about by holding 
as I said before, these councils. Why, 
we have an ex-ample of this in the 
Church, a striking example. The Presi- 
dency of the Church hold their council 
and call in the brethren with them and 
counsel upon given matters. They 
hold it every week, and counsel and 
talk over matters pertaining to the 
Church, the whole Church. Of course 
they are not supposed to come down 



to the details of a Stake or to the de- 
tails of a ward; they are looking after 
the general interests and welfare of 
the whole Church here and abroad in 
all the world. Such counsels in a 
ward capacity and in a Stake capacity 
would have good results; they certainly 
would have no bad results. If the 
Bishop of a ward were to call the 
Priesthood together they could talk 
over matters of interest to the ward, 
of labors that there are to accomplish, 
and take into consideration the propri- 
ety of making their influence felt in all 
the associations of the organization— in 
every association in the ward. These 
organizations and associations in the 
ward make up the grand total of the 
Church; they make up the grand to- 
tal in the greater organization; and 
they have to be watched over and 
cared for and looked after with a dili- 
gent eye. 

Now we are singularly situated; 
there are a great many things that 
need to be watched over, and that need 
to be looked after in order that we 
may retain the faith, retain our fel- 
lowship, retain our favor with the 1 
Lord. Somebody has to do it. The 1 
Lord has made these appointments.has 
given us these organizations, and when 
the Elders go out into the different 
Stakes of Zion, new wards are to be 
organized, new Stakes are to be organ- 
ized, the matter is canvassed and looked 
over carefully, and good men are 
sought for, diligent men are sought for, 
in order that they may have a proper 
organization, in order that the people 
may have proper care and proper at- 
tention when the ward or the Stake is 
thus organized. 

W e might bring this down in detail 
even in a ward. When we have teach- 
ers, to select, when we have Priests to 
select, when we have brethren to select 
for various positions and labors, we 
want to canvas the matter, look it 
over, and counsel together about these 
things that the greatest good may be 
effected by our labors, and that the 
greatest good may be accomplished 
through our labors in our various call- 
ings in the ministry whereunto we 
are appointed. 

Tt is desirable that no unworthy peo- 
ple go into the sacred places — go into 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 



15 



the houses^ of the Lord. They would 
not want to go there themselves if 
they understood matters properly. It 
is not desirable to have unworthy peo- 
ple go. And who is to know? It is 
not fair to suppose that the President 
of the Stake in endorsing these people 
personally knows them all. 

President Taylor once said, in speak- 
ing on this same subject, and giving 
counsel and advice, that if they were 
unacquainted with the doctrines of the 
Church and had not had experience, 
they should at least have experience 
in a ward somewhere, before they 
sought to go' to the Temple. 
He said they ought to be at 
least a year in some ward under 
some bishopric, before they sought to 
go to the house of the Lord. We find 
it very desirable to have good people 
present themselves at the doors of 
the house of the Lord, who has en- 
trusted us with this work, pertaining 
to our kindred that are passed away; 
has entrusted us with the work to have 
our families and our progenitors 
labored for and organized under the 
holy Priesthood; the children sealed to 
the parents from one generation to an- 
other, and to see that the work for the 
dead, as well as for the living, goes 
forward, as has been indicated by the 
erecting of temples to the name of the 
Most High. 

I remember in mv early experience 
in the Church that I never contemplat- 
ed that there would be more than one 
temple. T thought that would be all 
that would be needed for the work of 
the dead; but as it has rolled On, as 
we gain experience, we find that the 
work of the Lord is expanding, and we 
are also expanding in our views with 
regard to the work of the Lord. We 
are more enlightened now than we were 
before the temples were built. We 
have greater desires in many respects 
to hunt up and look after our kindred, 
to look after the genealogies of our 
forefathers who have died without a 
knowledge of the truth. Now this is 
one of the things in connection with 
a great many others that we have to 
<3o. We must not lose sight of it in 
our day nor in our lifetime. We must 



not have it said when we go to ' the 
other side of the veil, when we meet 
our kindred there and they perhaps ask 
us what we have done for them — we do 
not want to have to say we have done 
nothing for them. It would be much 
more desirable to say we have done 
all we could. We have hunted up and 
down the earth; we have traveled 
abroad to find records and genealogies 
of our kindred; we have done all that 
we could. How many of us can say 
this today, up to date? We have had 
four temples going now for some time 
and the people have been invited to at- 
tend to these matters, and how many 
could say up to date that they have 
done all they could for their kindred that 
have passed away? I presume that 
there are many that can say it and 
there are a great many that can't say 
it. It is advisable, therefore, my 
brethren and sisters, to not lose sight of 
this important labor, as well as educat- 
ing and training our sons and our 
young people to become ministers of 
the Gospel to be faithful representa- 
tives, honorable representatives of our 
people and of our Church. I repeat that 
in the midst of these labors we should 
not lose sight of ithe importance of at- 
tending to these matters in the tem- 
ples of the Lord, because there is a 
purpose and a design in these things, 
and those that enter into the spirit of it 
can comprehend it and understand it. 
When they come and make a com- 
mencement they want to stay longer, 
they want to stay a year, some of them, 
and continue their labors because they 
enter into the spirit of it. They see the 
importance of it more and more as they 
■progress in the work. 

'There are a great many things for 
our consideration as live, active Lat- 
ter-day Saints; a grea't many duties 
and responsibilities that are upon us, 
but there is nolthing required at our 
hands but that we may accomplish 
through our diligence and our faithful- 
ness in observing and keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord. 

I would urge upon you, my brethren, 
the Bishops and presidents of fo takes, 
who may be here, to try the experiment 
if you have not tried it, and have your 
counsel meetings occasionally, once a 
week or oftener; counsel together with

your brethren, and whatever is done 
let it be done with common consent 
from the head of the ward, from the 
head of the .Stake, from the head of the 
Church, let it all be done by com- 
mon consent: then everything- will 
be harmonious. We want to work 
in harmony, we want no friction, 
we do not want discord, we 
do not want contention among 
the Saints; we want peace and the good 
spirit of ithe Lord in -our homes and in 
our families. We desire that above all 
other things. We Want that union, that 
strength that will make us valiant in 
the work of the Lord, and the way to 
get it is to seek for it, look after it, 
and attend to this beautiful organiza- 
tion that the Lord has given us, and 
work together, counsel together in 
all matters pertaining to us spiritually, 
and pertaining to us temporarily. We 
Tsed to do this, I think, more than we 
do now. Those of us who went up into 
Cache valley a good many years ago 
to open up that country and develop it. 
had to do this, because we were sur- 
rounded by the enemy, the red men, 
who were on our path. They killed 
some of our brethren and we were 
driven together. We had to talk and 
counsel together, and work unitedly. 
If we went to the canyon for anything 
we had to go in force. One man did 
not start off alone, it was not safe, but 
we went in force, we worked unitedly 
in that district of country. And thus it 
was under the wise counsel of President 
Young, who would come to us and talk 
to. us like a father, told us what to do 
to save ourselves. Naturally we wanted 
to scatter all over the country, but there 
would not have been a town anywhere. 
He counseled with us and advised us 
what to do, and we can see and have 
seen the good in so doing. It is a good 
thing to do now, to counsel together and 
be agreed upon matters pertaining to 
our interests, and in doing this we learn 
to love one another. We learn to respect 
each other. We won't want to pass 
over the Bishop of our -ward and go 
somewhere else; we won't want to ig- 
nore the President of the Stake and go 
to someone else; nor we won't want to 
pass over the Apostles when they come 
around, but we will have the spirit of 



humility, that we may take counsel to- 
gether for our good. I am sure it will 
result in good to the wards and to the 
Stakes without doubt. We may 
know, through this means, everybody 
in our ward. The Bishop may become 
acquainted with every young man. If the 
president of the Elders' quorum, 
doesn't know him personally, why 
his brother knows him, his counselors 
know him, the president of the Elders' 
quorum knows, him, some of the Priest- 
hood there know him, some of the High 
Council may be there that may know 
him; what a nice thing- it would be for 
the Bishop to be acquainted with all 
these affairs. Talk these matters over 
together, . and not hurt anybody, 
but work for the salvation and 
unification of the people in the district 
where we live. We may find, in counsel- 
ing together, that there are some fami- 
lies that are careless, that are indiffer- 
ent. We may find also that the teachers 
are a little indifferent, and that they 
do not visit everybody, and they only 
make a visit occasionally. You may 
find in couseling together many things 
you might correct. You may find that 
some family is not living the lives of 
Latter-day Saints, not paying their 
tithing unto the Lord, and not doing 
their duty in helping to support the 
poor, and so on. They can foe kindly 
looked after, cared for, and watched 
over, and talked over in a gentle way, 
that they may be brought back into the 
fold and into full fellowship with the 
Church of Christ. 

Perhaps ' I am lengthening out too 
long in imy remarks. But I know, my 
brethren and sisters, that this work is 
true; I know it is from the Lord, and 
I bear record of this. I have had many 
testimonies from my youth up; testi- 
mony upon Itestimony with regard to 
the truth of this work, and I bear you 
this testimony, that this work is true, 
that the eye of the Lord is upon us, and 
He has organized His Church accord- 
ing to His mind and will, and accord- 
ing to the dictations of His spirit, and 
the brethren who stand at our head are 
inspired men of God. We have reason 
many times to hear record of this, be- 
cause we have seen it made manifest 
so plainly to us. God bless you. Amen.

number; and I pray the Lord to move 
upon them mightily by His Spirit, that 
we may be able to supply our brethren 
in the next year with three hundred 
Seventies that are willing to take upon 
themselves this labor. 

I realize, my brethren, that we should 
be charitable. I do know that our 
brethren are in debt, that they are in 
trouble and in difficulty. It is only 
two weeks ago since I personally in- 
terviewed eight bright, intelligent men 
who were perfectly able, physically, 
mentally, and, for aught I know, every 
other way except financially, to go on 
missions, and these eight brethren all 
declared that they were in debt and 
unable to go. I felt impressed by the 
Spirit to prophesy to them and to 
promise them that if they would have 
faith they could pay their obligations 
in the next six months, if they would 
make a covenant with the Lord that 
they would take up this labor and 
preach the Gospel to the nations of the 
earth. But it leaves a very grave re- 
sponsibility upon the Bishops and the 
presidents of Stakes; for when you 
send that class of men, they leave be- 
hind them probably large families to 
be taken care of. I feel that that is 
one reason that so many young men 
have been called — men who were not 
Seventies— because many of them had 
no families to leave behind. But I 
say to you, my brethren and sisters, in- 
asmuch as this is my calling, that it 
devolves upon this people, notwith- 
standing there is a great expense to 
it. From a human standpoint, it 
would seem as if it Avould take from 
our people nearly all their means to 
preach the Gospel to every nation. 
Yet, if I understand the matter aright, 
when the angel came, that was the 
message he delivered to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

I do not desire to occupy more Of 
your time; but I did desire to call your 
attention to that part of our labor that 
is devolving upon the people. I pray 
the Lord that He will continue to bless 
us, and bless the earth, that it shall 
yield forth of its strength, so that our 
people may free themselves from debt, 
and take up this labor; that it may not 



be necessary to hunt and search as we 
now are under the necessity of doing, 
to find men to send forth to the na- 
tions. I pray the Lord to bless our 
brethren, the Apostles, for my sympa- 
thy is with them. I desire to say to 
the people that I hope the time will 
never come when it will be necessary 
for any of our people, through their 
strife and their troubles — their politi- 
cal troubles— <to make any further 
trouble for their brethren; for when I 
look back to that aged servant of God 
—President Wilford Woodruff— who has 
passed away, and when I think of our 
other brethren who follow him, how 
true and how faithful, how full of in- 
tegrity they are; they have never 
swerved, but they have been steadfast 
and have fought valiantly for the 
cause of Christ, and just as they get 
here and have established themselves 
seemingly permanently, and it seems 
when it ought to have been a time of 
peace and rest for our brethren, some 
of us who became restless and got the 
spirit of the world had to make more 
trouble for them. I pray the Lord 
that He may soften our hearts, that we 
may love the Priesthood, that we may 
honor them, that we may serve the 
Lord and keep His commandments, aind 
have the Spirit of God burning in our 
hearts like a living fire. This is my 
desire, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

This is God's work— Human weaknesses— Payment 
of Tithing— Every day duties. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, 
that while I stand before you this af- 
ternoon I shall have your faith and 
prayers in the testimony that I may 
bear and in the few remarks that I 
may make. It is very unexpected to 
me to have to stand before you at this 
time; but I always esteem it a priv- 
ilege to bear testimony to the truth of 
the great latter day work, and also to 
that which is being accomplished by 
the labors of our brethren. I under- 
stand and realize that we are accom- 
plishing the work that God has de- 
signed; that we are fulfilling His pur- 
poses; that this is His work, and not

ours; and that according to His good 
pleasure, according to His divine will, 
all things will be brought about, and 
the words of His servants will be ful- 
filled, until this earth is prepared for 
the reign of His Son. I have no doubt 
of this on my mind. All things, what- 
soever they are, that the Lord has 
willed in the restoration of His Gos- 
pel, in the gathering of His people, in 
the building up of His kingdom, will be 
brought about. And though our ef- 
forts from day to day may seem but 
small and insignificant, yet in the end 
they will fulfill the purposes designed 
of God. Therefore, as a people we have 
every cause for encouragement. God 
will not leave us to ourselves. He will 
not forsake us. He will not give us 
over into the power of our enemies. 
He will not permit that His kingdom 
in this dispensation shall be over- 
thrown. Though we are weak, though 
we commit follies, yet in these respects 
we are not different from those who 
have gone before us. We are told, in 
the various divine records that have 
reached us, that those to whom God 
gave His revelations, on whom He im- 
posed the responsibility of performing 
His work, and who were His repre- 
sentatives to the people, were men of 
like weaknesses as ourselves. We are 
furthermore told in the Book of Mor- 
mon that God gives men weaknesses, 
that by having weaknesses they may 
be better prepared, be better able to 
do what He requires. There is one 
thing of which we are satisfied, that 
there is none that is perfect save God. 
We are instructed to seek to be per- 
fect, even as God and His Son Jesus 
Christ a^re perfect; and that Jesus 
Christ so advised shows to me that it 
is possible for us so to be. The Savior 
■ not say this in derision, or in irony; 
hut he so encourages us all that we 
may seek to reach that which is per- 
fect as near as we possibly can, and 
by so doing we progress. We have 
long since learned that obstacles, as 
far as the Church of Christ is con- 
cerned, are things to be overcome. 
When we speak of obstacles we mean 
that they are things that stand in our 
rath, not to prevent our progress, but 



that we may triumph by overcoming 
them; for most of us have learned with 
the youthful Prophet Nephi that God 
never gives a commandment to men 
but he provides the way by which that 
commandment can be obeyed. In other 
words, the Lord does not. ask impossi- 
bilities of us. Many things that have 
been done by this people through the 
grace of God and by His help, in gath- 
ering together to these mountains, and 
the things that have been accomplished 
since we gathered here, not only show 
the overshadowing hand of God in our 
favor, that He has been with us all. 
the time, that He has protected us, 
and that He has directed His servants 
who have led us, but also, looked at 
humanly, we may say that this people 
have performed miracles in that which 
they have accomplished in the building 
up of this community in this inter- 
mountain region. But our history,, 
when read in future ages, should the 
world continue as it is now — which, of 
course, we do not expect; but if it 
were possible in the future to look on 
the present as we now look into the 
past, if our history could be read in 
this light, removed from the obstruc- 
tions that at present obscure the view 
of things as they really are, we shall 
be surprised at what we have accom- 
plished through God's help, the influ- 
ence that we have wielded .in the 
world, the results of the ministry of 
the Elders, and the changes that we 
have produced in the world's history. 
We are a small people, but, as we often 
say, our numbers are not commensu- 
rate with our influence. God has giv- 
en us power — power above our num- 
bers, and this is so because we are 
seeking to serve Him. He has also 
made us a wealthy people. We may 
not have many multi-millionaires in 
our midst; but when we take the riches 
of this people, head for head, I do not 
believe this Avide world over we can 
find any community of a quarter of a 
million of people taking them as we 
would take ourselves, who are so well 
situated with regard to material pros- 
perity as we are. And this is but the 
beginning. How often have we heard 
the servants of God promise us that if 



:20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we would be faithful to God, if we 
would keep His commandments, if we 
would pay our tithing, if we would* be 
honest with the Lord and generous in 
our donations, that He would bless u.3 
to an extent that we could not at pres- 
ent conceive. I believe this is so. The 
little that we have done has brought 
its reward. We none of us claim that 
we, as a people, faithfully observe the 
law of tithing; yet the Lord has abun- 
dantly blessed us. True, we have been 
thrifty, we have been patient, we have 
been persevering, we have been eco- 
nomical — all of which virtues tend to 
the increase of material wealth. But 
why have we been so? We have been 
so because it is the genius of the Gos- 
pel that men should be thrifty, eco- 
nomical and temperate in all things; 
and that the virtues which have an 
especial effect upon man's present con- 
dition should be observed as well as 
those that more particularly affect 
man's future life. The Lord is now 
blessing us abundantly in our flocks 
and herds, in our crops, and in all 
other respects in which we materially 
increase, and I believe He will look to 
us to honor His law. Now is a most 
convenient time, a most proper time- 
never a better time — when we should 
be faithful to the Lord in paying our 
tithes and our offerings; that the 
hands, of the servants of God who bear 
the responsibilities of this Church 
should be loosened; that they should 
not be held under the burden of debt 
and the responsibilities that weigh so 
heavily upon their shoulders — the re- 
sponsibilities which President Wood- 
ruff felt so keenly, and which should 
not be upon those who bear authority 
and presidency in the Church of Jesus 
Christ. They should be relieved from 
these burdens by all of us doing our 
duty, by us observing those laws that 
we acknowledge, in our testimonies, 
come from God. These things affect 
us all. We are bound up in the 
Church. What would we be if it were 
not that we are members of the 
Church? What should we be without 
the Church? What should we amount 
to? Where would our salvation be? 
What could we accomplish alone and 



singlehanded, or in a disorganized 
condition to further the purposes of 
God and prepare men for - the coming 
of His Son Jesus and for that time 
when the earth is to be filled with a 
knowledge of God, when His purposes 
are to be accomplished, not only in the 
redemption of the living, but also in 
the redemption of the dead. Without 
us, we are told, they who have gone 
before cannot be made perfect, and we 
without them would be insufficient for 
the fulfillment of the purposes of God. 
All the various generations of men 
have to be welded together in indis- 
soluble links, so that as one great 
whole, as one united family, we may 
be prepared for the great final con- 
summation, when all things that our 
Heavenly Father has created and made 
shall be returned to him in the condi- 
tion in which they were when he pro- 
nounced them, at the beginning, very 
good. But in view of this great con- 
summation we sometimes lose sight of 
the fact that it is little by little that 
all these great things are accomplished. 
We lose sight of that truth that is 
taught in the verses our children learn 
in the primary departments in the 
schools, that it is "the little drops of 
water and little grains of sand" that 
go to make up the ocean and the land 
of which this earth is composed. It is 
the little actions of our lives that go 
to make up our characters. It is the 
minutes that make the days, and the 
days that make the years, and the 
years that make eternity. So it is 'with 
us in our everyday walk; in the ful- 
fillment of our everyday duties we 
shall bear off the kingdom of God 
triumphant; not so much by .deeds 'of 
heroism that few of us may be called 
upon to perform, but by the daily, pa- 
tient, continuous performance of our 
every day duties, laborious though 
they may be, wearisome though they 
may be, tiresome though they may be, 
and drudgery though they may some- 
times be. It is by the performance of 
these duties that we are building up 
the kingdom of God, that we are ac- 
complishing His purposes, and that 
will eventually bring us that perfec- 
tion of character that will enable us,

May God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters. God bless this conference, that 
all that is said and done herein may 



have God's approval, is my prayer,

The choir sang the anthem: 
Light and truth the world are waking.

SECOND DAY. 



Friday, Oct. 7th, 10 a. m. 

Singing by the choir and congrega- 
tion: 

Come all ye sons of Zdon, 
And let us praise the Lord; 

His ransomed are returning, 
According to His word. 

Prayer by Elder George B. Wallace. 
The hymn which begins as follows, 
was sung by the choir: 

Great God, attend while Zion sings 
The joy that from Thy presence 
springs; 

To spend one day with Th&e on earth 
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The right of the Saints to participate in affairs of 
the Church— All should be interested— Spiritual 
and temporal affairs inseparable— Necessity for 
mutual aid, industry and enterprise— True order 
of equality— Principle of stewardship— Thoughts 
on home-building — Difficult personal exper- 
iences. 

It is with a feeling of great depend- 
ence upon the Lord that I arise to 
speak to you for a short time. I sin- 
cerely desire an interest in your faith 
and prayers, that I may be guided in 
my remarks by the Spirit of wisdom 
and by the inspiration of the Lord. 

I have enjoyed the spirit of the con- 
ference so far. I was heartily in ac- 
cord with the remarks that were made 
by the brethren who spoke to us yes- 
terday. I trust that the same good 
spirit may continue with us through- 
out the conference. It is a great priv- 
ilege that Latter-day Saints enjoy, to 
come to this Tabernacle once or twice 
a year to listen to the voices of the 
servants of the Lord who have been 
chosen as our leaders, and to par- 
take of the spirit which accompanies 
the gatherings of the Saints on occa- 
sions like this, and to participate in 



the business which may be brought be- 
fore the people for .their consideration 
and approval. We come together as 
officers and members in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, each 
and all of us having rights and the 
privilege to participate in the affairs 
of the Church, as to the spirit and 
principle of government, in the contin- 
uance of our organizations, in sus- 
taining the measures that may be pre- 
sented before us or that may come up 
for consideration by the people. We 
are commanded indeed that we shall 
meet together in conference to attend 
to the business of the Church. It is 
here that we have the privilege of ex- 
pressing our faith and confidence or 
otherwise in those men who have been 
appointed to fill the various positions 
as general authorities of the Church, 
from the First President down to the 
last general officer in the Church. This 
is not a mere form. There is efficacy 
in it. It means something. And it is 
a matter that we should all appreciate 
and take part in intelligently, feeling- 
ly, and with an earnest desire in our 
hearts to see the Church of Christ es 
tablished upon the foundation of direct 
revelation and inspiration from the Al- 
mighty. We should come here with a 
determination in our hearts to sustain 
that which is good, and to discounte- 
nance that which may not be good. It 
is our privilege and right to determine 
by the Spirit of God between the right 
and the wrong, between that which 
will build up and sustain the work of 
the Lord in the earth and that which 
in its nature will tend to disintegrate 
and destroy or to divide the people of 
God in the earth. Every member of 
the Church should be deeply interest- 
ed in the welfare of the whole Church.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Those who are called to official posi- 
tions in the Church are not by any 
means the only ones who have an in- 
terest in the welfare or the advance- 
ment of the kingdom of God. Every 
true and faithful Latter-day Saint 
ought to feel as earnest a desire in his 
or her heart for the advancement of 
the cause of Zion and for the firm es- 
tablishment of the principles of truth 
in the earth as President Snow, or his 
counselors, or any of the Twelve Apos- 
tles, or any of the leading authorities 
of the Church. This Church is not es- 
tablished for one, or for a few; but the 
great plan of salvation and eternal life, 
which has been revealed to "man in this 
latter day, is for the purpose of sav- 
ing and exalting all mankind who will 
yield obedience to the requirements 
that are made of them. It is not 
necessary to argue the point that all 
men must receive the truth and obey 
it in order to be benefitted by it. The 
Lord has spoken from the heavens, 
and men must become acquainted with 
this fact. This truth must be declared 
unto men, and they must receive it be- 
fore they can be benefited by this 
great revelation in the latter day. All 
men must believe; they must repent of 
sin and forsake it, in order that they 
may be restored to fellowship with 
the Lord and be brought into His fold, 
be numbered as His children and be- 
come entitled to the special gifts and 
blessings of the Spirit of God which 
are promised unto those who are born 
again. 

Having gathered together, as we 
have done, in these valleys of the 
mountains, we have great responsi- 
bilities resting upon us. It is our busi- 
ness, whatever the world may say 
about it, to look after the temporal 
as well as the spiritual welfare of the 
people of God. We cannot divide the 
temporal from the spiritual, or the 
spiritual from the temporal. We can- 
not give advice and counsel to the peo- 
ple calculated to benefit them spirit- 
ually that will not also benefit them 
temporally: neither can we give to the 
people advice or admonition which 
will be beneficial to them from a tem- 
poral point of view that will not tend 
to benefit and strengthen them spirit- 



ually. We are of a dual nature. We 
are not all spiritual, neither are we all 
temporal. The spiritual and the tem- 
poral are blended together. It is abso- 
lutely necessary in the cause of re- 
demption, in which we are engaged, 
that the temporal welfare of the people 
should be looked after, and their tem- 
poral salvation secured unto them as 
well as their spiritual salvation. It is 
for this purpose that the Lord Al- 
mighty has gathered us out of the na- 
tions of the earth and called us into 
the tops of these mountains, where we 
can be organized according to the pat- 
tern that He has given to us, and 
where, by means of appointing officers 
in the Church to look after the people, 
all the people may be guarded from the 
evils of the world by the shepherds 
that are placed over them in the vari- 
ous organizations of the Church, from 
the Presidency down to the Teacher, 
who is called to minister unto the peo- 
ple in their homes. And it is not one 
of the least considerations that th<B 
people should be provided with employ- 
ment, and be put in a position where 
■they can obtain homes for themselves, 
so that they may all become, if they 
are not already, self-sustaining and, 
so far as temporal wants are con- 
cerned, absolutely independent. It is, 
of course, impossible for any individual 
to become entirely independent of oth- 
ers. The Lord Almighty has not de- 
signed that we should atand severally 
or alone in the world. He has made us 
social beings, and He has ordained 
that we shall help one another and be 
associated with each other. There- 
fore, no man or woman can be abso- 
lutely independent of all others. There 
is a certain degree of dependency that 
must exist. It is perfectly natural and 
proper that it should be so. And that 
consistent and natural relationship 
should not be ignored nor forgotten; 
for the moment we forget or ignore this 
principle we become, us It were, a law 
unto ourselves, and under those con- 
ditions we are an element of disorder 
and of contention. It is a law of God, 
which should be recognized by us, 
that we should love one another, that 
we should extend the helping hand to 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 



23 



each other, that we should seek to do 
good one to another, and that we 
should uphold one another in that 
which is right and acceptable in the 
sight of the Lord. But it does not fol- 
low that we should be dependent one 
upon another for the food that we eat, 
for the raiment we wear, and for the 
shelter we need. We will take, for in- 
stance, the family unit. In a family 
organization the wife assists the hus- 
band, the husband assists the wife, 
the children assist the parents, and the 
parents watch over and protect the 
children. Thus they are united togeth- 
er as one family. Now, in that family 
each member can do something that 
is worthy of his hire, so to speak. 
Every member of the household 
should be industrious, frugal and pru- 
dent, and diligent and earnest in seek- 
ing the welfare and benefit of every 
member of the family. The family 
should be in a position to take posses- 
sion of a portion of the earth that the 
Lord has given to us, for an inherit- 
ance: and by means of industry and 
labor and the exercise of wisdom, they 
should be able to obtain out of the 
earth, and from the flocks and herds 
and the other means of wealth which 
the Lord has placed within our reach, 
all that is necessary to sustain the 
family and make it independent, so far 
as its food, raiment and habitation are 
concerned. And if all the families that 
compose the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints were in a position 
to sustain themselves out of the earth 
or by the skill of their labor the whole 
Church would be independent in this 
respect. Of course it is necessary 
that labor should be diversified. It is 
not % necessary, nor would it be pru- 
dent, for us all to be farmers. It would 
not do for us all to be mechanics, or 
manufacturers. or merchants. Ac- 
cording to the multiplicity of labor or 
of openings for industry tha t exis t in 
a community will be the independence 
of the community and employment for 
the people. 

But there are many people who seem 
to be unable to obtain labor, and they 
come around from time to time asking 
if the brethren cannot give them em- 



ployment. This should never be in any 
community, and especially in a com- 
munity of Latter-day Saints. This 
country, in the beginning, was called 
Deseret — the honey bee — signifying in- 
dustry; Utah, in the early days, 
was likened to the hive of bees, in 
which every bee was busy and was 
supposed to be able to do something 
toward building up and strengthening 
the entire colony. This should be the 
condition of the people of Zion. Every 
individual should be in a position to 
add something to the w r ealth of the 
whole. Everyone should be increasing, 
improving, and advancing in some 
way, and accomplishing something for 
his or her good and for the good of the 
whole. 

Then again, it is written that "it is 
not given that one man should possess 
that which is above another." Of 
course, there is some allowance to be 
made for this expression. A man who 
has ability superior to another man, 
and who is able to manage and control 
larger affairs than another, may pos- 
sess far more than another who is not 
able to control and manage as much as 
he. But if they each had what they 
were " capable of managing and of us- 
ing wisely and prudently, they would 
each have alike. It is like the quart 
and the pint measures. You cannot 
put a quart into a pint measure; but 
you can put a pint into a quart meas- 
ure, and then you can duplicate it. If 
the pint measure is full, that is all it 
has capacity to hold; if the quart 
measure is full, it can hold no more; 
and they are equal, so far as their 
capacity is concerned. I never expect 
to see the day when we shall come to 
the iron bedstead plan— that if a man 
be too long for the bedstead he will 
have to be shortened to fit it; or if he 
be too short, he will have to be 
stretched out. I expect to see every 
man a steward over his inheritance, 
and I expect to see every man man- 
age his inheritance according to the 
light and wisdom that he possesses and 
in accordance with his capacity for 
managing. If his capacity is greater 
than another's he will have more than 
another, because he cannot be cur-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tailed in his liberties or rights to do 
good and to magnify, to enlarge, to in- 
crease, to be greater and better, be- 
cause there is another that cannot be 
as great or as good as he. "What is 
meant then by this passage which says 
that it is not given that one man 
should possess that which is above 
another? I take it that in part at 
least it means this: It is not right for 
one man, because of superior advan- 
tages that he may possess in a social 
or financial way, or in any other way, 
to take advantage of others and to de- 
prive them of that which naturally and 
rightfully belongs to them. I under- 
stand, too, that it is not right for men 
to combine together in order to op- 
press their fellow beings and to take 
advantage of them. The Spirit of the 
Lord forbids this, and commands that 
it shall not be in the midst of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Furthermore, the 
Lord requires that when men have 
abundance they shall be as humble, as 
economical and as prudent in the 
management of their abundance as the 
man who possesses much less is ex- 
pected to be prudent and economical 
in the management of that which la 
given to him. 

I want to make an application of 
this principle in the matter of home- 
steads. Only a few days ago I visited 
a locality where I looked over a broad 
extent of country, containing large 
fields, some of them enclosed, some of 
them partly enclosed.others not fenced 
at all; many of them cultivated nicely 
and carefully, others filled with weeds 
and noxious growths. The latter were 
•not being made useful to man, and I 
said to myself, why should this be? 
Here are opportunities for many men 
to be employed. Some man possesses 
here more than he is capable of Con- 
trolling, more than he can wisely han- 
dle, and he is simply half-doing or" 
quarter-doing that which should be 
done, and in a sense he is depriving 
others of privileges that they should 
enjoy. I asked who owned a certain 
field there. I was told who owned it. 
What is the reason it is not cultivated? 
The answer came, Because the man 
that owns it has 1,800 acres of land 



here, moire or less, and possessioms in 
other parts of the country and he has 
more than he can attend to, so his 
farm here is left to go to weeds. He 
cuts one crop of lucern a year, where- 
as if it were properly attended to three 
crops might be secured. I said to my- 
self, Here is an exemplincati-m of the 
word of the Lord that it is not given 
that one man should possess that 
which is above another. This man has 
more than he can attend to. That 
1,800 acres of land more or less ought 
to be divided up. Other men ought to 
be invited there, and they ought to 
have the privilege of cultivating that 
soil, and getting three times tne wealth 
out of it that this man gets. They 
would have an inheritance that they 
could attend to, that they could labor 
wisely upon, and that they could ac- 
complish something with. Then, point- 
ing to another field, I asked whose 
field is this. I was told that that 
belonged to another man, who had a 
thousand acres or more. Now, a thou- 
sand acres of land, when it is properly 
cultivated, will produce a great deal 
towards the sustenance of man, and a 
number of men could make a living off 
that land; whereas it is doing the man 
who now holds it, and who is unable 
to give it the proper attention, one- 
third the good perhaps it ought to do. 
This T consider to be unwise steward- 
ship. Our sons and our daughters who 
are seeking homes are under the neces- 
sity of going to Idaho, or to Arizona, 
or to Mexico, or to Wyoming, to find 
land, when there are fields on fields 
nearer home that should be opened up 
and made into homes for our young 
men and women. Why should the 
wealthy, because they are weajthy 
monopolize the land, when they them- 
selves cannot cultivate it as it ought 
to be? It is a wrong principle, and 1 
think advice and counsel might proper- 
ly be given to some of these rich men 
that have large tracts of land here in 
this valley in which we live or else- 
where which they cannot use wisely or 
profitably, to persuade them to divide 
it up with their children or with some- 
body else's children, upon such terms 
as the young people will be able to

25 



make homes for themselves near the 
parental roof, instead of having- to go 
a long distance, and* leave the land 
here to be taken up by strangers. I 
will relate one other circumstance. T 
asked about another farm there, and 
was told that the brother who owned 
it possessed more than a thousand 
acres of land, all under mortgage. How 
did he get it mortgaged? T asked. 
Well, this good brother, in the land 
boom that we had some years ago, con- 
ceived the idea that he could make 
lots of money by securing land and 
then selling it out again at an advance; 
but the bottom of the boom fell out, 
the money that he borrowed to buy 
the land with drew interest, and he 
could not make the interest out of the 
land that he possessed; the result is 
that in a short time it will go into the 
hands of Eastern people, who have ad- 
vanced money to this good brother. 
The meaning of that is that a large 
tract of land together with all the im- 
provements thereon, will ere long go 
into the hands of strangers, to be held 
by them in large quantities and prob- 
ably at exorbitant prices, so that our 
young people will be una'o'e to pur- 
chase it, and will be compelled to go 
elsewhere to seek homes for them- 
selves, or else pay large interest into 
the coffers of money lenders. This is 
all wrong. I said to my friend that it 
was a great pity, the people of the 
neighborhood could not form a union 
and each contribute a portion of the 
means necessary to create a fund suffi- 
cient to redeem this land and hold it 
among themselves. That, however, 
did not seem to be feasible, because 
every man had all -the land he could 
use, and nearly every one had more 
than he could use, and therefore had 
their hands full to attend to their own 
affairs; besides, they did not have any 
means to spare to help another brother 
out of his trouble or to secure those 
lands to the people at home. 

Now, I do not object to good people 
owning land here, no matter where 
they live or where they come from. 
But this is the point: You and J have 
come here to live and stay. We have 
not come here to speculate and make 



money, and then take it away. We 
came here to make our home, to live 
and to die here. But there are people 
who come here simply to make money: 
and after they have made money out 
of the people, they are only too willing 
to go somewhere else and spend it. 
That is not building up Zion, or the 
people at home. That is not looking 
after our interests here. 

I do not know just how this matter 
can be worked out; but I am satisfied 
that there is a solution to it. If I had 
a thousand acres of land, and I could 
only attend to a hundred acres, I 
would try to get nine other families to 
come on to the land. I would parcel 
out my thousand acres between my- 
self and these nine families; and I 
would say to them, "Here is the land; 
cultivate it, and pay me out of the 
products of your labor from year to 
year such an amount as you can afford 
until you have paid for the land, and 
then I will give you a deed to it." If 
I had more land than I could take care 
of. I would invite other men to come 
with me and build up a community, 
and thus give to others a chance to live 
as well as myself. Will any of the 
brethren do this that have more than 
they can take care of? 

We have had a bountiful harvest. 
The Lord has blessed the earth, has 
made it extremely fruitful, and the 
people have been greatly prospered. 
New let us remember each other. Let 
us look after the poor and the op- 
pressed and those who need counsel 
and succor. Let us each be interest- 
ed in the other. Let us not leave it all 
to President Snow, and his counselors, 
and the Twelve Apostles; not leave it 
to the Bishops and their counselors, or 
to the official members of the Church. 
Let every man who possesses wealth 
or an inheritance in Zion, that can 
part with a portion of it to a brother 
in some reasonable way, do so in order 
to help his brother and to build up our 
country. Those who have come to live 
and to die in this work in which we 
are engaged, it is our business to look 
after them first; and when we have 
^oked after them to the utmost, then 
do as much good to others as we possi-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



bly can. Our mission in the world is 
to do good to all mankind. 

These are some of my feelings and 
thoughts in relation to home-building. 
Many of our people have had to move 
away from here and go to distant 
parts, separating from kindred and 
the homes of their birth, in order to 
find homes for themselves. This is all 
right; and whenever it ! s done it 
should be done under the counsel and 
with the knowledge and blessing of the 
authorities of the Church. Every man 
holding a standing in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, if 
he wants to move from one place to 
another, should take his recommenda- 
tion from the Bishop of the ward where 
he lives, to locate in some other place 
where he can find members of the 
Church. I say this is essential. It is 
designed of the Lord that we should 
form communities, that we should as- 
sociate together, be one people, and 
have one faith, one Lord, one hope, 
and one baptism; that we should be 
united in the labors of life, and the 
labors of life should be to p -omote the 
welfare of mankind, to ir crease the 
happiness of the children of men and 
their knowledge of those things that 
pertain to. eternal life. For we have 
the words of eternal life, no matter 
what people think or say about it. 
We cannot stop to listen to their ca- 
vilings, their disputations, and their de- 
nials of the truth. We know that we 
have received the truth. We know 
that we have received a portion of the 
Spirit of truth; not in its fullness, for 
we are not perfect. Now we only see 
and know in' part. We never can see 
rnd know and feel perfecetly until we 
overcome the weakness of mortality 
and bring ourselves into subjection to 
the laws of God. The Lord h- Tp us to 
do this, and strengthen us in every 
good desire of our hearts. For we 
must build up and beautify Zion. 
We should encourage the people of 
Zion to be industrious and self-sustain- 
ing. We must not depend upon one 
another for our existence in that sense 
We must be working bees in the hive 
of Deseret, industrious, prudent, in,- 
stant in season and out of season. 



We must find something useful for our 
hands to do. If we cannot find it here, 
let us go somewhere else acid seek for 
it. If you can find out who 1he&t men 
are that own from 500 to 2,000 acres of 
land in this valley or elsewhere, more 
than they can attend to, go and makj 
a proposition to them to take a hun- 
dred acres of their land, make it fruit- 
ful, and pay to them so much per an- 
num until you have paid for the land. 
This, of course, is only a suggestion. It 
may not be worth very much; but any 
proposition tending to ameliorate the 
condition of mankind or to open up 
the way before them, is worthy of be- 
ing tried. There is nothing like trying 
except success, and trying earnestly 
means success. This idea of sitting 
down and saying, "I cannot," is a fool- 
ish thing. No Latter-day Saint should 
get to this condition. We should feel 
in our hearts to say, "I will, I can, I 
must; my necessities require it; God 
requires it; my fellow creatures re- 
quire that I should do something for 
the common good; therefore I cannot 
sit down and be idle, like a leech, suck- 
ing my nourishment from the life 
blood of my fellow beings." 

I talked a little in this strain at one 
of our late conferences, and was gross- 
ly, insulted for it. I received anony- 
mous letters from people who said, 
"Try your own medicine." They 
wanted me to do what I had advised 
others to do. Now, to save such the 
trouble of repeating their suggestion, 
I want to tell them that I have not ad- 
vised you to do anything that I have 
not done myself in the ..lays of my 
youth. I know what it is to cultivate 
the desert soil. I know what it is to 
take water from the natural channels 
and to conduct it upon the dry, parched 
land, digging ditches for that purpose. 
I was not a blacksmith, but I know 
what it is to have to take off the well 
worn tires from our old vagons— the 
worn-out tires that were used in cross- 
ing the plains— and taking them to the 
blacksmith, with a crooked stick for a 
beam, and with our crooked sticks 
for handles and get the blacksmith to 
make a plow out. of our tires. I know 
what it is to herd cattle on the plains,

and mountains, and in the canyons; for 
I have done it years and years of my 
life. I know what it is to go into these 
mountains and get wood for fuel, for 
the winter's use, and also for those 
who would buy, in order that I might 
get my school books, or some clothing 
that I needed. I know what it is to go 
into the canyons and cut poles feu" 
fencing farms; for I have done that, 
too. Therefore, I have had some ex- 
perience in these matters, and I only 
say to you that which I would do my- 
self, if I were in the circumstances 
that I once was, or in the condition 
that some of my brethren are in today. 
Then, .too, in those days we could not 
go to a brother and borrow of him 
that which we needed, because all the 
brethren were in the same condition. 
We could not borrow a plow, because 
our brother did not have a plow per- 
chance; or if he did, he needed to use 
it himself at the same time. Further- 
more, I know how to set a tire with 
rawhide. We used to have to do that. 
I know how to fasten the spokes of the 
wheel in the hub by wrapping green 
rawhide around the spokes to hold 
them together, when we could not do 
anything else. And we know what it 
is to work, and toil and delve for a 
living out of the barren soil, and that, 
too, before the curse was removed from 
this soil; for the curse of sterility was 
upon the soil when we came to this 
valley. Today there are tens of thou- 
sands of acres of land that are produc- 
ing rich harvests of grain and fruits, 
which, when we came into this valley, 
could not be cultivated at all, and 
would scarcely raise a sunflower. 
I have seen the transformation, and I 
know what has brought it about. It 
has not all been the labor of man. It 
has also "been through the blessing of 
God upon the soil. God has removed 
the curse, has removed the sterility 
from the s.oil, and has made it fruitful. 
Therefore, I give glory, honor, praise 
and adoration to God my Father, the 
giver of every good and perfect gift. 
I acknowledge His hand in the pros- 
perity of this people in this State. I 
acknowledge the blessing of the Lord 
upon all the Saints, in that they have 



been preserved from the hands of their 
enemies, and from the spirit of apos- 
tasy and darkness, dissension and di- 
vision; that we have had the spirit of 
union in our hearts, and of love one 
toward another and towards the Presi- 
dency and Apostles of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Let 
us continue to cultivate this spirit of 
union and love, and of community-in- 
terest. Let us adhere to it, cleave to 
it with undivided and unyielding per- 
tinacity, that we may be indeed one, 
that we may be God's people; for un- 
less we are one we are not His. God 
bless you, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

How firm a foundation, ye Sadnts of the 
Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word. 

Benediction by Elder C. D. Fjelsted.

The choir sang the hymn which be- 
gins, 

Praise ye the Lord! my heart shall 
join 

In work so pleasant, so divine, 
Now, while the flesh is my abode, 
And when my soul ascends to God. 

Prayer by Elder Angus M. Cannon. 

Singing: 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled, 

Ye nations now look up, 

It waves to all the world. 

In Deseret's sweet, peaceful land; 

On Zion's mount behold it stand.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



us with the words of life, the spirit of 
faith, the consolation for our trials 
and temptations, and the enrichment 
in the spirit of the Gospel by which to 
further progress in the way of life. 

Much of the instruction that we have 
had pertains to matters of our self- 
support and our sustenance, which is 
not only timely and appropriate, but 
very important, because we need con- 
tinually an enlargement, an extension 
of our opportunities; and there are 
many young people among us who do 
not sense the importance of assuming 
the responsibilities of life and settling 
down into a position in society, of tak- 
ing to themselves the character of a 
head of a family, and of establishing 
themselves among the Saints of Zion. 
It should be realized by all people that 
the comforts of life which we have, 
whether we get them directly or indi- 
rectly, come out of the ground to us; 
not only our food, but our raiment, 
from our hats to our boots, and from 
our feathers to the finest wear we put 
on. Then even the gold and silver 
and all precious jewels come forth out 
of the earth. They who till the ground 
and bring forth out of it the neces- 
saries, the blessings and the comforts 
ot life, by so much 'improve and in- 
crease the general happiness and good 
of all. There are no portions of the 
human family that are so independent 
and comfortable in the ways of life 
generally as those that are on a farm 
which they can attend to wisely and 
profitably, and obtain from it the neces- 
saries of life. If we could realize and 
understand this more perfectly, and 
think of it more seriously and consider- 
ately, it would be better for a great 
many of our young, ambitious men and 
women, wno now are seeking for posi- 
tions in life to escape labor and toil. 
While they are establishing associations 
and fixing up measures to cultivate 
their physical energies and develop 
their muscles, the general labor that is 
to be done in the cultivation of the soil, 
the producing of all that is necessary 
for living, both in the held for men and 
in the house and dairy for women, 
would furnish 'all the physical culture 
that they need; and this properly as- 



sorted and used would save consider- 
able expense in that certain direction. 

Now it has got to that, as has been 
hinted to us., that if any. large enter- 
prise is undertaken, whether it be a 
private or a public one, there is a seek, 
in'g directly for something or other in 
the shape of a bonus. If men come 
among us with capital to do us any 
good, to put up some machinery or 
anything of that kind, they first lay 
claim to some bonus. Whereas, in the 
beginning of this work, everybody was 
expected to take care of himself and do 
something to help build up the Church, 
the thing is getting very fast turned 
round the other way, and people now, 
if t'hey have been unfortunate in the 
"boom" or through their own careless- 
ness, are expecting the Church to turn 
in and support them. We have got the 
thing headed around the wrong way in 
that respect. We ought to continue the 
plan and sentiment of sustaining our- 
selves and of having something to help 
build up the Church, as in the begin- 
ning. This sentiment, if continued and 
carried out, will grow and extend until 
our unoccupied lands will be occupied 
and cultivated, and these valleys will 
be filled up, and our settlements extend 
to Canada in the north, to Mexico in 
the south, and back to Missouri in the 
east. 

I have rejoiced in these instructions 
given us for our profit. I feel now like 
speaking to you some of my own per- 
sonal reflections, in a different strain. 
The last time we heard our venerable 
and beloved President Woodruff speak 
to us here, how delightfully he did ad- 
dress us, as if he might not have been 
more than forty-five years of age! He 
gave us a good long talk— long enough 
for a common sermon, and it was in- 
teresting, instructive and emphatic. It 
would be good for those who did not 
hear it, to get and read it occasionally. 
His last teachings all seemed to be giv- 
en with a view on his part that it might 
be possibly the last that he would say 
to us. While hearing him speak in 
that excellent, free and enlivening man- 
ner, I could not help but think, "Is it 
possible that this will be the last time 
we shall hear him?" Well, President 
Woodruff has departed from us in our

present relation, and has gone to join 
the holy throng — the Prophet Joseph, 
the Patriarch Hyrum, and twelve ot- 
fifteen of the Apostles that have died 
and gone during his lifetime and ours. 
It is only a few years ago that Presi- 
dent Snow and I were ordained down 
here in the Old Fort. We have lived 
to see the members of nearly a whole 
quorum depart hence, and we are left 
behind, though we are following them 
up as fast as time will move us on. 

Now, there are certain peculiar no- 
tions that people sometimes have. 
Once in a while there is one who thinks 
we were in a hurry to get the author- 
ities of the Church filled up, almost be- 
fore it was decent and proper in their 
estimation. I want to say a little about 
that. There is no standard of human 
invention, no precedent among man- 
kind, that can determine how long or 
how short that period shall be. But 
the Lord has determined a rule for it. 
Back in the days when the Prophet 
Joseph was slain, and the Church was 
left without him here upon the earth, 
the whole people mourned — mourned as 
we have never known how to mourn 
since. I want to tell you Saints, that 
felt you mourned when President Young 
died, when President Taylor died, or 
now that President Woodruff has de- 
parted from us, it is no such mourning 
as was felt through all Nauvoo and 
among all the Saints when the Prophet 
and Patriarch were slain. It just 
seemed as if everything around us, 
even the animals, the trees and the hab- 
itations, were clothed in mourning. We 
felt his absence, because he was to us 
instead of God. He directed us in every- 
thing, taught us in all the great prin- 
ciples that pertain to our salvation and 
exaltation throughout all this mortal 
existence and clear into the eternities. 
Anybody that has the spirit of revela- 
tion, and who will read the last revela- 
tions that he gave us, cannot help but 
wonder and admire, and comprehend 
something of the great mind and ca- 
pacity of soul that he had acquired dur- 
ing his short experience, in the Gospel, 
of twenty-four years here in the flesh. 

Now, when he w r as taken away, it 
was the first great and terrible ex- 
perience in that line, and there was no 
rule left when the Church organization 



should be perfected. Let me cite you to 
a few facts in connection with this. 
When that event occurred, the Apostles 
were all away throughout the United 
States, on missions, except John Taylor 
and Willard Richards. They were in 
prison with the Prophet Joseph. Presi- 
dent Taylor was shot nearly to pieces, 
so that he had like to have died, ac- 
cording to all human appearance. Wil- 
lard just lost a drop of blood from one 
of his ears; a ball whistled so near that 
it broke his skin and let a drop of blood 
mingle with the others. The Prophet 
Brigham was in Boston, with Apostle 
Woodruff. It was a sad 'and sorrowful 
time. Immediately -the Prophet Joseph 
was slain, one man and anotlier, and 
another, who had been taught by him 
to comprehend some great principles of 
the Gospel, came to feel so important 
that one^ man said, since Joseph was 
dead there was no man living to whom 
he owed allegiance. He therefore, in 
the greatness of his self-importance, 
gathered up his family with a few 
others and went away to Texas. Ly- 
man Wight was this man, whose cog- 
nomen among the Twelve was, "the 
wild ram of the mountain." By and by 
one of his sons returned to us.. Another 
man, Alpheus Cutler, in the greatness 
of his experience and self-sufficiency, 
took his family and some friends and 
went to a northern state, making a 
camp of his own, ready to build up a 
city, a people, a nation, and become a 
prophet. George Miller, one of the pre- 
siding Bishops, also started with a -few 
and went off among the Poncha Indi- 
ans. Another one, James J. Strang, 
who thought he had the thing fixed so 
it had come to stay, went off with a 
few to Beaver Island, in Lake Michigan, 
and carried on his operations for a 
while, till by and by one of his follow- 
ers sickened of him and assassinated 
him. This is the way these great men, 
who tho'ught they were somebody, have 
gone in the 'Strength of their own en- 
dowments, feeling themselves as great 
as Joseph the Prophet. How was it, 
when the Prophet Brigham came back 
to Nauvoo, that he realized that the 
powers of the Priesthood and the keys 
thereof had come down upon him? He 
went and stood in his place. Sidney 
Rigdon wanted to become a "guardian"

to the Church, to guide and lead them 
till he should see Joseph again. And 
thus, one after another, these different 
influences wrought. About this time, 
too, to fill up the cup and make it run 
over and 'to accomplish the wickedness 
of the world, a mob got around and 
forced the Twelve, when 'they got back 
to Nauvoo, to enter into an agreement 
with them that 'they and the people 
would get up and leave the country. 
This they did. They made their ar- 
rangements, and, as quick as we could 
finish the Temple and get the blessings 
of the Lord upon us, the Saints started 
out into the wilderness to find a coun- 
try as far from civilization as they 
could. 

The Prophet Joseph had a feeling or 
a premonition of what might be, and 
we find it on the record of his history 
that he felt forebodings that he might 
not stay to see that Temple completed. 
He took the Twelve aside — those who 
were faithful — and he gave them their 
endowments in 'a holy place, in a new 
building that he consecrated for that 
purpose. He placed upon them the 
keys, 'authority and powers which the 
Lord and the angels had conferred 
upon him. You recollect that John the 
Baptist came and ordained Joseph and 
Oliver to the Aaroruc Priesthood. Peter, 
James and John came and ordained him 
and Oliver unto the Melchisedek Priest- 
hood — the holy Apostleship. In the 
Temple at Kirtland, Moses, Elias and 
Elijah appeared and conferred upon 
him the keys of the gathering of Israel, 
of the Gospel of Abraham, and of the 
turning of the hearts of the fathers to 
the children and the children to their 
fathers. Joseph called the brethren 
aside and placed all these keys, powers 
and blessings, that he had received, 
upon them. You have heard President 
Woodruff testify of this, and of the 
great work and marvelous power 
thereof. Well, these things bestowed 
upon the brethren caused some men to 
become headstrong, and in view of what 
they knew they thought they could 
build up the Church unto God, build up 
the kingdom of God, and stand at the 
head of it themselves. 

While this was going on, the powers of 
the Priesthood rested down upon the 
Twelve Apostles, and President Young 



always took pains to have a majority 
of them within reach, where he could 
arrange for any decision that he found 
it necessary to make. He had 
a great vison, in which Joseph 
said to us through him, "Get the 
Holy Spirit, and keep it." That is u. 
great injunction that is upon us all. If 
we want to go where these men are, 
we must get the Holy Spirit and walk 
in the light of it. After he and the 
Pioneers had been out here and had 
found this place fori us to come to live 
in, and then went back to the Missis- 
sippi river, in Winter Quarters, the 
Spirit of the Lord, the revelation of the 
Lord, came upon him. It was about 
two years and a half, on that occasion, 
that the Church had been without a 
First Presidency, till the Lord made 
manifest to them, in Winter Quarters, 
about December, 1847, that the organ- 
ization s'hould be completed. There be- 
ing no good place for it, they picked 
out men and set them to work to build 
a tabernacle in Kanesville, for the con- 
ference. At that conference the First 
Presidency was accepted, and, accord- 
ing to the dictation of the revelation, 
they, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- 
ball and Willard Richards, were upheld 
by the unanimous consent and vote and 
prayers of God's people. Thus the first 
great calamity to the Church was reme- 
died, and the fulness of the Priesthood 
Was again restored. 

In 1849 the Presidency and the breth- 
ren got together down in the old fort 
here, and there was a series of confer- 
ences and councils held, where four of 
the brethren were ordained unto the 
Apostleship, to fill the vacancies made 
by those who had been promoted to the 
First Presidency, and of this number 
were Brothers Charles C. Rich, Lorenzo 
Snow, Erastus Snow and myself. For 
ten years and a half I was the young- 
est member of the quorum, and when I 
look back it seems marvelous to me 
that I have lived to see, in about fifty 
years, nearly a whole quorum of Apos- 
tles pass away to the other world. They 
have gone to labor with the Prophet 
Joseph, and they cannot feel lonesome. 
I cannot help but think how happy 
President Woodruff must be in getting 
into their society, and rejoicing and 
glorifying God in the great work there

of preparing for the coming of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

When it came to pass that President 
Brigham Young departed from us, then 
there was another period when the 
Presidency of the Church came upon 
the Twelve. During this period it de- 
volved upon President John Taylor, the 
President of the Twelve Apostles, and 
this continued for a while. At that 
time it was so that a number of the 
brethren of the Twelve were but young 
men, not of long experience, and we had 
to have a little time to get acquainted 
with each other, and we had to labor to 
accomplish the things that were re- 
quired. During this time some enter- 
tained ideas of one kind, some of 
another. It was thought that some 
should be brought to the Presidency 
who were not entitled to it, and we had 
to take a little time to learn and in- 
quire into the mind of the Lord on 
these matters. By and by, when we had 
come to a proper state of feeling, to an 
entire unanimity, .and when the Lord 
saw fit, He made it manifest unto the 
Twelve that the First Presidency should 
again be organized. Whereupon Presi- 
dent John Taylor was called to be 
President of the Church, and Apostles 
Geo. Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith 
were called to be his counselors. 

Now, I want 'to say to you that the 
only rule there is about constructing 
the First Presidency is this: When the 
quorum of the Twelve Apostles are of 
one heart and of one mind, and they at- 
tain to that faith that the Lord will 
make manifest His will, then is the time 
when the Presidency are appointed. 
There is no other precedent established, 
only to obtain the fellowship, the union 
and the faith of the council to prevail 
with the Lord to make manifest these 
things unto them. 

So again, when President Taylor died, 
we were left in a similar condition, and 
the Twelve held the direction of affairs. 
By and by, when it came the proper 
time, when we felt the Spirit of the 
Lord burning in all our hearts, wnen 
the word of the Lord came to President 
Woodruff, then another Presidency was 
constructed. It was done by the same 
rule — all were agreed and united, and 
prevailed with the Lord to make mani- 
fest His will about it. 



My brethren and sisters, there are 
some truths greater than other truths. 
As the Lord said to Abraham, where you 
see one truth greater than another, 
then you may know there is another 
truth greater than that. The great 
truth that regulates us in all these 
matters is the truth of being united. 
The Lord has told us in the 
revelations that except 'we are 
one we are not His. That is 
a great, capital truth; and If 
you will carry it with you into your 
wards and into your Stakes, as also 
into your families, you will find a great, 
capital blessing with it everywhere. 

When President Woodruff was taken 
from us, how were we? Why, we had 
nobody that wanted to go off to Cal- 
ifornia, to Canada, to Mexico, or to the 
Sandwich Islands even, to set up a 
church of his own; but we were all 
here — the two counselors that remained 
and the Twelve Apostles, fourteen in 
all. When we were thus together, I 
want to say to you that under those 
circumstances and a^ that time there 
were no opposing, contending influ- 
ences. There was nobody wanted to go 
away and set up a kingdom. But we 
were united. And I want to testify 
that a great measure of this blessing of 
unity, fellowship and love has come 
down upon us, and through us to the 
people, by the untiring zeal, energy and 
devotion of President Lorenzo Snow. 
While he was President of the Twelve 
Apostles he labored diligently unto this 
end; and I have never seen a time, nor 
have you ever seen a time, in this dis- 
pensation, when there was a more cor- 
dial, solid unanimity in the Presidency 
and Apostles of the Church than there 
is to-day. 

When we, as the Apostles, accepted 
the responsibility to preside, President 
Cannon took his seat in the Council of 
the Twelve, where he occupied it before 
he left it as a counselor to President 
Woodruff. President Jos. F. Smith did 
the same. The * Twelve Apostles as- 
sumed the presidency of the Church, al- 
though it was but for a short time — 
from September 2nd to September 13th. 
On the latter day we were together, 
and in contemplating the interests of 
the Church, temporal and eternal, we 
remembered the words of President 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Woodruff while he was with us, that he 
did not think the Church should be long 
without its full organization, and it be- 
gan to burn in our hearts. One after 
another felt as If a First Presidency- 
ought to be organized, if the word of 
the Lord were so; and directly the word 
of the Lord was given to us that the 
time had come to organize, and so we 
organized. President Lorenzo iSnow and 
his counselors were presented, and ac-; 
cepted by the brethren in council, as the 
First Presidency of the Church. We 
were all united on it, our hearts were 
warm in it, the fire of. the Lord burned 
in every bosom, and we could not keep 
still for the joy we had in this thing. 

Now, that is the only rule there is in 
regard to filling or keeping open the va- 
cancy of the First Presidency of the 
Church. It is when the brethren are 
united in the love and power of the 
Holy Priesthood. When the word of the 
Lord comes to us, 'it tells us what to do, 
when to do, and how to do. So that no 
one need feel that we have waited too 
short a time 'after President Woodruff's 
departure to make it both decent and 
proper to fill the vacancy. When the 
Lord speaks, then is the time! When 
His mind is made manifest, we should 
honor and accept it, and carry it out 
to the uttermost. I rejoice in that the 
Lord is so ready to make manifest to 
us; that we did not have to wait two 
years and a half, nor a year and a half, 
for Him to give it to us. 

President Woodruff was full of teach- 
ing concerning the last instructions of 
the Prophet Joseph to the Apostles, 
and the blessings he put upon them. 
Brother Woodruff was the last one of 
that distinguished Council of the 
Twelve which the Prophet Joseph ad- 
ministered to personally; not in the 
Temple (it was before the Temple was 
completed), but in a retired place, where 
only a very few knew of It. It was 
necessary that they should have this 
blessing, so that if Joseph should be 
taken away it might be instituted and 
carried on in the Temple, when the 
Temple was completed. Oh, blessed be 
the name of the Lord, for that he 
caused it to be brought about in this 
way! And blessed be His holy name, 
too, that he caused us to be roused up 
out of our homes and sent out into 



these mountains before that war of the 
Rebellion came upon us. Oh, how we 
hated to go! But how true the Lord 
made His word to come out when He 
said, "My people shall be willing in the 
day of my power." He knew how to 
make us willing, although it took mobs 
to come upon us and kill our brethren, 
the Prophets. 

Brethren, this great work is upon us. 
The Lord has given us some singular 
features connected with it. One of them 
is this: He has said by the mouth of 
the angel that the hour of His judg- 
ment is come. The 'Savior, in looking 
down into our time, as recorded in the 
24th chap, of Matthew, told the breth- 
ren that in the last days not only should 
false Christs and false Prophets ap- 
pear and try to lead away many, but 
He told them that in these times there 
should be wars and rumors of wars, 
and great distress among all nations; 
and so great should be the trouble and 
distress that it should be only a vexa- 
tion to understand the report thereof 
Now then, what do we see? We have 
already lived to see wars in our day. 
They are a necessary concomitant to 
this latter-day work. They cannot be 
avoided. They are a necessary part of 
the latter-day program. Let me draw 
your minds a little to some of the cir- 
cumstances, and see if it is not so. I 
look upon it as part of the great phil- 
osophy of the last days' dispensation, 
that the wars of our times are just aa 
necessary in the fulfilling of the word 
and the work of the Lord as are any 
others of His gracious promises made 
to us. It was necessary to have this 
liberal government that His Church 
might be established upon this land. 
He could not have done it in any ot 
the monarchies of the old world. Why 
was it that there was a dissatisfied 
element called non-conformists? It 
was so with them, between the re- 
formers and the Catholics, that they 
could not stay and be comfortable, and 
they had to go off to Holland, to get a 
retreat where they could survive, wor- 
ship God and entertain the faith they 
believed in. Directly, when Columbus 
had discovered this country and it 
came the proper time, these same non- 
conformists, afterwards called Puritans, 
came over to America as fast as tihey 



PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 



could — they who were not tied up to 
papacy nor to the Church of England, 
but who felt a desire for more liberty 
to worship God, came over here, and 
they became the thirteen little colonies 
away down on the Atlantic coast. What 
was the result of it? They had to have 
a war, declare their independence, and 
become a people to themselves before 
they could obtain that liberty to wor- 
ship thait was required before the Lord 
sent His revelations among- them. War 
was actually necessary to bring- step by 
step the liberty the human family has. 

We get along a little further, and the 
Prophet Joseph was among us. The 
Saints were driven from New York 
state to Kirtland, from Kirtland to 
Missouri, and then from city to city. 
The first mission of the Twelve Apos- 
tles was to New England. A few peo- 
ple receive it. The leading men of the 
Church— the Prophet Joseph, and Hy- 
rum, Brigham and Heber — were from 
the Eastern states. Buit how was it in 
the South? When we sent our Elders in- 
to the Southern States they persecuted 
them. Elders Wilford Woodruff David 
W. Patten and Jedediah M. Grant suc- 
ceeded in getting a few from those 
states; among the rest, Brother A. O. 
Smoot, late president of the Utah 
Stake. But no considerable work was 
ever done in the 'Southern States until 
after the war of the rebellion. That 
came and destroyed about a million 
souls, and that destruction produced 
liberty to the sl'aves. After that the 
Gospel could go, and it is having free 
course until there are many scores of 
our Elders there, and in some of these 
states our people have meeting houses, 
branches, societies and schools. The 
work is being established and taking 
root among the people. You see,' the 
war was necessary to bring that about. 
Of course, we never could have got into 
the Southern States if something had 
not happened to break off the bonds of 
the African, so that slavery might be 
abolished. 

So we may look all along the experi- 
ence of the Latter-day Saints. Let me 
take you across into the old country. 
When I was over there in 1895,presiding 
in Europe, the work was going on in 
Great Britain, Scandinavia and Swit- 
zerland. A voice came over from Dres- 



den and wanted to know what was this 
doctrine they heard of. We adopted 
measures to send it over to them. How 
did we do it? Here is Brother Maeser, 
known to all Israel, the first fruits, I 
may say, of the German confederacy. 
We went over there and in the dead 
hour of the night baptized eight souls 
in the river Elbe. But they could not 
stay a great while before they were 
driven away. Brother 'Maeser, after a 
little, was put in charge of a policeman, 
who took him across the province and 
delivered him to another, and he was 
taken from one place to another until 
he came over to me at Liverpool. At 
those times we could do very little, al- 
most nothing. Brothers Orson Spencer 
and Jacob Houtz were appointed to go 
there and see if they could start a mis- 
sion. They went, and on every appli- 
cation to preach in the confederacy 
they were given notice that they had 
so many hours to get out; so they had 
to leave. Again, Apostle Orson Pratt 
and Brother William W. Riter were 
sent over to Austria, to see if perhaps 
over there some better opportunity 
might be found; but they labored with- 
out being able to establish a church. 
The work did not seem to take hold, 
and they came back without accom- 
plishing a great deal in the way of es- 
tablishing a church in that country. 
But latterly what has been the fact? 
Why, when that war arose between 
France and Germany, over Alsace and 
Lorraine, it had the effect of loosening 
up the bonds. Quietly and gradually 
our brethren are now preaching the 
Gospel among that people, and the work 
of God is progressing, though some- 
times the brethren are banished. Only 
a little while ago President Snow's son 
was banished from, a province. When 
they were banished they did as the 
Savior said — being driven from one 
place they fled to another. 

Thus the work of the Lord is going 
on. These wars have to occur to loosen 
up the bonds of the governments that 
are so tight and strong against relig- 
ious liberty. I set it down as a fixed 
principle that these wars are going to 
be as necessary to the progress of lib- 
erty in this dispensation as are the la- 
bors of our Elders. We have got to ac- 
cept these things. And if our sons have 



34 



GENERAL COhFERENCE 



to go away in the wars, we must arm 
'them with the power of God, with the 
power of faith; our prayers^ must go 
after them; and by and by these sons 
will rise up to be mighty men of Zion; 
when that time comes that man will 
say, "Let us not go up against Zion, for 
the inhabitants thereof are terrible." 
They will go to other places, where the 
prey is easier to acquire. . So then we 
need not be worried. Mothers, do not 
be troubled about your sons who are 
away in the war. The Lord's eyes are 
over them; the holy anointing is upon 
them. Most of them, perhaps all, have 
the Priesthood, and they will call upon 
the Lord, and He will deliver them, 
make them mighty, give them distinc- 
tion, and they will come as the sons of 
Brother Brigham have come — to places 
of prominence, and by and by 'they may 
have to lead the armies of Israel. These 
things are a part of the business. 

"We want no cowards in our band, 
Who will our colors fly; 

We call for valiant-hearted men, 
Who're not afraid to die. 

They that are not afraid to die are 
the ones 'that are likeliest to live. The 
Lord has said, "'He that loseth his life 
for my sake, shall find it," even life 
everlasting - . 

I rejoice in the great work of the 
Lord. I know it is true. I found that 
out a long time ago. I only wish I could 
do more to further it and to help pro- 
mote the cause. I strive to live my re- 
ligion, and I feel thankful for the de- 
gree of confidence and love which you 
show to me from time to time, as well 
as to all of my brethren. I pray you, 
my dear brethren and sisters, be you 
strengthened in this Conference by all 
the counsels you get. Let every man 
who is the head of a family realize that 
he wants to labor for the benefit ol 
every soul the Lord has given him to 
come forth out of his loins, that he 
may be able to have by and by a 
righteous seed, a numerous seed in the 
earth, and partakers of those blessings 
that were sealed upon the fathers an- 
ciently, and have since been sealed 
upon us, their children. I pray the Lord 
to bless you, to bless us all, with health 
of body, strength of mind, and a spirit 
to prefer. Zion and her interests above 
all things. In ancient times, when 



Zion's interests were concentrated on 
the hill of Jerusalem, David said: 

"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my 
right hand forget her cunning. 

"If I do not remember thee, let my 
tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, 
if I prefer not Jerusalem above my 
chief joy." 

Let us then make it our study to love 
Zion above all things, and seek to live 
to bring her interests to pass. I pray 
the Lord to bless all the interests ol 
Zion, and help us to live to honor Him, 
to love to do His will as long as He 
likes to have us tarry in the flesh, that 
when we go it may be well with us, as 
we believe it to be well with these our 
brethren who have gone before us. 
Amen.

Necessity for Faith and Courage — Example of 
Nephi — Church officers should be exemplars— 
The Church perpetuated— Prophecies fulfilled— 
Personal testimonies. 

I rejoice exceedingly in having the 
privilege once more of assembling with 
the Latter-day Saints in General Con- 
ference, and I earnestly desire that the 
time I may occupy this afternoon may 
be for our mutual benefit; that the 
Lord will inspire my inind, that I may 
be prompted to say something that will 
strengthen our faith and renew our de- 
termination to press forward valiantly 
in the discharge of the duties and the 
obligations that rest upon us as mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I have never had 
any other desire in standing before the 
Latter-day Saints than that I might 
be able to say something for their good 
and for my own good, and that would 
be calculated to increase that deter- 
mination that ought to animate each 
and every Latter-day Saint, to "seek 
first the kingdom of God." 

I realize that we all have our weak- 
nesses, and that we do and say many 
things that are not pleasing in the 
sight of our Heavenly Father; but if 
we desire above all other things upon 
this earth to know the mind and will 
of God, and if we desire the strength 
of character, after we shall learn the 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



35 



mind and will of our Heavenly Father, 
to carry it out in our lives, I do know 
that God will help us, and that as we 
grow in years and in knowledge and 
in understanding that we will grow 
also in the power and the ability to ac- 
complish His will. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
teachings of this conference. When 
President Cannon was preaching of 
the faith needed by the Latter-day 
Saints, there came to my mind that 
scripture which was quoted here yes- 
terday by Brother Cowley, from the 
Prophet Nephi, that faithful man, and 
I felt in my heart that when it came 
my time to speak to the Latter-day 
Saints, I should quote that passage to 
them, and urge upon them to gain the 
same faith that Nephi of old had; and 
I rejoice in the testimony that was 
borne here by Brother Cowley when he 
quoted that passage to us in our meet- 
ing. 

I feel that there is an abundance of 
room for the Latter-day Saints to cul- 
tivate that faith. I feel that we should 
learn never to become discouraged. I 
endorse with all my heart the remarks 
of Brother Joseph F. Smith, that we 
should never become discouraged, but 
that we should always be full of faith, 
full of determination to labor for the 
onward advancement of the kingdom 
of God upon the earth. I rejoice my- 
self that the Lord has blessed me 
with a hopeful disposition; rejoice in 
the fact that it requires a great deal 
to discourage me in any of the things 
nf this life. In the battle of life I am 
not easily discouraged. I believe in the 
saying: "Tf there is ever a time for a 
man to be ambitious, it is not when 
ambition is easy, but when it is hard." 
Then is the time for us to labor, and 
m the same sentence from which I am 
quoting are these words: "Fight in 
the dark; if you are down, die hard 
and you will not die at all." 

I believe there are many Latter-day 
Saints who in sickness give up; they 
surrender to the power of the adver- 
sary; and I believe that there are 
many sleeping in their graves who 
might have lived to labor for the on- 
ward advancement of God's kingdom, 



if they had been determined to live, 
determined that they would not die, 
unless in the providence of God they 
had finished their labor here on the 
earth. I believe there is something in 
the will power that God has given to 
us. I believe when we determine with- 
in our hearts that by and with the 
blessings of God our Heavenly Father 
we will accomplish a certain labor, God 
gives the ability to accomplish that 
labor; but when we lay down, when we 
become discouraged, when we look at 
the top of the mountain and say it is 
impossible to climb to the summit, 
while we never make an effort it will 
never be accomplished. 

Nephi said to his father that he 
would go and do the things which the 
Lord commanded, and when his breth- 
ren failed to get the plates and they 
came back discouraged, ' he was not 
discouraged, but said unto his breth- 
ren: "Let us go up again unto Jerusa- 
lem; let us be faithful in keeping the 
commandments of God, for the Lord is 
mightier than' all the earth, then why 
not mightier than Laban and his fifty, 
yea or even his tens of thousands." 
And after they had tried again and 
were discouraged, he tried once more. 
He said to his brethren: "As the Lord 
lives and as we live we will not go 
down unto our father in the wilderness 
until we have accomplished that which 
the Lord has commanded us." Now 
we as Latter-day Saints should re- 
member that Nephi succeeded; we 
should remember that in the face of 
obstacles he secured the plates con- 
taining the precious words of God; 
that he secured the record which was 
beyond price; that was invaluable to 
his desceendants, and without which 
it would have been difficult for many 
of them to have found the straight and 
narrow path that leads to life eternal. 

if there is one character more than 
another in the Book of Mormon that 
I have admired and whose example I 
have felt to emulate, that character 
has been Nephi of old; never discour- 
aged, never disheartened, always ready, 
always determined to labor to the best 
of his ability for the accomplishment 
of the purposes of God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I say to the Latter-day Saints that 
we should have an ideal in life; that 
we should have an objcet we wish to 
reach, and that object should be that 
to the full extent of our ability, to the 
full extent of the power that God has 
given us, physical, intellectual, and 
spiritual, we will accomplish His pur- 
poses here on the earth. We should 
have an ambition that no man shall 
do more for the onward advancement 
of God's kingdom than we. As laborers 
in the different Stakes of Zion, stand- 
ing as presidents of Stakes or as coun- 
selors to a president of a Stake, no man 
should allow any other member of that 
Stake to be a more honest tithe payer 
than he is. I say no man should pre- 
side over a Stake unless he is absolute- 
ly honest with God in paying his tith- 
ing. Why? . Because he cannot con- 
scientiously urge upon other people to 
be strictly honest. If we have been 
careless in this particular in the past, 
let us be careless no more. I say no 
man presiding over a Stake of Zion or 
over a ward should fail to pay his 
tithes, or should fail to observe the 
Word of Wisdom. Why? Because 
he is unable to stand up before a body 
of people and teach them by the 
demonstration of the spirit of God that 
they ought to obey these command- 
ments from the Lord. This is our duty 
— to place ourselves in a position where- 
by when we stand up to teach the peo- 
ple, we can teach them by the inspi- 
ration of the spirit of God as it shall 
descend upon us; but if we are not ob- 
serving the commandments of God, we 
can not with power, and with force, 
and with strength urge upon other peo- 
ple that they obey the commandments 
that we ourselves are failing to obey. 

We have heard here today from the 
lips of the President of the Quorum of 
the Apostles, that the First Presidency 
of the Church at the death of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith could not be or- 
ganized. Why? Because men hold- 
ing the Apostleship were not true to 
their covenants to God. That was 
why they were led away from that 
straight and narrow path. They failed 
to follow their file leader who stood at 
the head of the quorum of the Apostles. 



They failed to follow that man upon 
whom the mantle of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith fell. 

There are those that know not God. 
There are those that think the Latter- 
day Saints are a mistaken people, that 
they are deluded and that they have 
no faith in the supernatural; but I 
say here today that I know the mantle 
of Joseph Smith fell upon the Prophet 
Brigham Young. I know it, and I am 
willing to meet the testimony that I 
bear. How do I know it? I know it 
because of my mother, a more honest 
woman than whom never lived, a more 
devoted Latter-day Saint can not be 
found; because she and scores of 
others have told me that they saw the 
Prophet Brigham Young when he spoke 
with the voice of Joseph Smith; when 
he looked like the prophet Joseph; and 
I know that these people are honest; 
and in addition to this I know by the 
inspiration of God to me that Brigham 
Young was a Prophet of God. I know 
that those that lost the spirit of God, 
that failed to follow the Prophet 
Brigham Young, have come to naught. 
There are none who were led away 
from the Church but those who failed, 
to follow their file leader. Brig- 
ham Young was the only file 
leader that amounted to anything; 
and the Church of God under 
the leadership of God, using the 
Prophet Brigham Young as an instru- 
ment in His hands, has grown and in- 
creased and spread abroad in the 
land, and has filled these mountains. 
We are here today what the Prophet 
Joseph said we should be, "a mighty 
people in the midst of the Rocky 
Mountains." I will read to you the 
exact language of that prophecy ut- 
tered by Joseph Smith with reference 
to the Latter-day Saints coming to 
these mountains. "I prophesied that 
the Saints would continue to suffer 
much affliction, and would be driven to 
the Rocky Mountains; many would 
apostatize; others would be put to 
death by our persecutors, or lose their 
lives in consequence of exposure and 
disease, but more would live to go and 
assist in making settlements and build- 
ing cities and see the Saints become a

mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains." Now I have read 
this in your hearing, and I desire par- 
ticularly to call the attention of all 
Israel to this prophecy, and to the fact 
that it has been fulfilled. I have done 
this recently in several of the Stakes 
of Zion. I have done it because there 
is a question, and an active labor now 
being" carried out among the Latter- 
day Saints by what is known as the 
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, but as Brother Rich- 
ards, I think it was, said, there is no 
such .thing, as the Church was never 
disorganized. But I desire to call 
your attention to this one prophecy. 
The Prophet of God proclaimed that 
the Saints should be driven to the 
Rocky Mountains; that they should be- 
come in the Rocky Mountains a great 
and mighty, people, and we are the 
Saints and the "Josephites" are not in 
it. So, if the prophecy was uttered 
by a Prophet of God, and if it has been 
fulfilled, and if we are the Sainlts, 
then the Josephites will have to reject 
the chief corner stone upon which 
their religion rests, which is that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God. 

Now there is another thing- — the 
Prophet Joseph Smith proclaimed that 
the Saints should be driven from city 
to city, from county to county, from 
state to state, and finally driven out 
of the confines of the United States, all 
of which was fulfilled. What else? 
He said the time would come when not 
only a city, when not only a county, 
when not only a state, would array them- 
selves against this handful of people 
called Mormons, but it should come to 
pass that the whole United States 
should array themselves against the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. Was this prophecy fulfilled? 
Yes, to the very letter. Driven here 
from our homes in the states to Mexi- 
can soil, the United States sent its 
army against us, not a state militia, 
but the army of the United States of 
America against the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, but not 
against the Josephites. Please re- 
member that. This remarkable 
prophecy must fall to the ground if the 



Josephites are in it to the least bit of 
a small particle of a degree. But as 
if to doubly emphasize the words of 
the Prophet Joseph, the United States 
government confiscated all of the prop- 
erty, both real and personal, belonging 
to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. They finally discovered 
their mistake and gave it back to us, 
for which we are truly grateful, but 
we would like them to give back the 
expense that it cost to manage it while 
they had it. I have picked up a news- 
paper and read in bold headlines, "The 
United States of America versus the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints," and I have laid down the 
paper and said, "Thanks be to God that 
the United States of America has put 
upon the prophecies of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith the stamp of divinity." 
And I say once more, thanks be to the 
United States that they have put the 
quietus on the claims of the Josephite 
church, because the United States have 
never arrayed themselves against the 
Josephites. The Prophet Joseph told 
us that our name should be cast out 
for evil all over the world. Why, the 
Josephites are beloved; nobody casts 
their name out as evil. Another 
prophecy that was handled very nicely 
in the Improvement Era, and to which 
I am really indebted for the idea com- 
ing into my head: The assistant editor 
took up the question of an interview 
with the Prophet Joseph by the late 
Stephen A. Douglass, When this Steph- 
en A. Douglass was an obscure attor- 
ney he met with the Prophet Joseph 
and they conversed about the affairs 
of the offices of the government, and 
in that interview Joseph told this ob- 
scure attorney, "The day will come, 
Mr. Douglass, when you will aspire to 
be President of the United States, and 
I say to you, if you shall ever raise 
your hand against the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, you shall 
be defeated in your ambition, and you 
shall never reach the presidential, 
chair." Years rolled on, and this ob- 
scure man became noted in Illinois; he 
became a member of the legislature, he 
entered the halls of Congress; and he 
finally aspired to the presidential chair; 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and thinking that he could gain some 
slight political advantage by opposing 
the Latter-day Saints, he did it. The 
"Deseret Evening News" then took up 
his opposition, quoted to him what the 
Prophet of God said — that he should 
be defeated, told him that he had sealed 
his own doom. He was defeated. One 
more nail, my friends, in the coffin of 
our Josephite friends; because it was 
not the Josephites that Stephen A. 
Douglass raised his voice against, but it 
was the Church of Christ that Joseph 
Smith, as the instrument in the hands 
of God, had established upon the earth, 
and the keys which he had bestowed up- 
on the ApOstles. In opposing that work, 
Stephen A. Douglass sealed his doom 
when he aspired to the presidential 
chair. 

These things should appeal to the 
minds of all young men and young 
ladies of Israel. We should realize 
that we have the Church of Christ. We 
should realize that the power of the 
Priesthood of God rests upon the men 
that lead this Church. Why, you take 
men that come from all over the world, 
and they are surprised at the great 
mind, as they term it, that Brigham 
Young possessed, at the wonderful 
statesman he was. I recognize the 
great mind of Brigham Young; I rec- 
ognize the great man that he was, but 
I say to you that it was God speaking 
through and directing Brigham Young 
that made him the great man that he 
was. The servants of God are the 
most humble men that I have ever 
been associated with in my life. They 
take no credit to themselves; they re- 
alize that they are dependent upon 
God alone, and that without inspiration 
of His spirit they are as naught. They 
not only realize, but they know, that 
God lives and that He directs them. 
. Do I know that Lorenzo Snow is a 
Prophet of God? Yes, I do. Do I 
know that Wilford Woodruff was a 
Prophet of God? Yes, I do. Do I 
know that John Taylor and Brigham 
Young were Prophets of God? Yes, I 
do. I know it as well as I know when 
I take hold of the poles of an electric 
battery, and they turn on the current, 
that I have been shocked. Do I khow 



that the gifts and graces of the Gospei 
abound among the Latter-day Saints? 
I do. Do I stand here today a living 
monument, a living witness, that God 
has raised me from a bed of affliction, 
where I was given up and told that I 
had to die? Yes, I do. Do I know 
that God gave me the witness of the 
Holy Spirit that I should live and not 
die? Yes, I do. I say to the Latter- 
day Saints that I know by the revela- 
tions of the spirit of God to me that 
He lives, that Jesus is the Christ; that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God; 
and I pray God that we may all so live 
that this knowledge may be our guid- 
ing star, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

Promises of God— Restoration of the Priesthood- 
Saints a pure people- Consistency of prayer- 
Saints must be just— Confidence in the President. 

I doubt very much if it is possible for 
us to appreciate the blessings that we 
enjoy as a people. It may be that those 
who have been gathered from the na- 
tions of the earth appreciate the Gos- 
pel, appreciate the light and truth 
that is vouchsafed unto us, individually, 
who serve God and keep His command- 
ments. I know that my soul is filled 
with thanksgiving to Almighty God for 
the privilege I have of being a member 
of the Church of Christ. Why it should 
be so persistently called the "Mormon 
Church" is a curiosity. The Lord has 
given unto us a promise that is very- 
sweet to us, and that is, that if we will 
love Him and keep His commandments 
we shall prosper in the land. He has 
also given unto us the hope of a glori- 
ous resurrection. We do not doubt the 
resurrection; we do not doubt the abil- 
ity of God to raise us from the dead, for 
He promised the house of Israel, 
through Ezekiel, that He would bring 
them out of. their graves, ana put them 
in the lands of their possessions, and 
that they should kncnw that He wa» 
God. 

Let me refer you to the revelation 
that was given 'concerning the using of 
wine for the Sacrament. You will find 
it in the 27th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, which says: 



ELDER GEORGE TEAS DALE

3. Wherefore a commandment I give 
unto you, that you shall not purchase 
wine, neither strong drink of your ene- 
mies : 

4. Wherefore, you shall partake of 
none, except it is made new among 
you; yea, in my Father's kingdom 
which shall be built upon the earth. 

5. Behold, this is wisdom in me; 
wherefore marvel not, for the hour 
cometh that I will drink of the fruit 
of the vine with you on the earth, and 
with Moroni, whom I have sent among 
you to reveal the Book of Mormon con- 
taining the fulness of my everlasting 
Gosipel", to whom I have committed the 
keys of the record of the stick of 
Ephraim: 

6. And also with Ellas, to whom I 
have committed the keys of bringing 
to pass the restoration of all' things 
spoken by the mouth of all the holy 
prophets since the world began, con- 
cerning the last days: 

7. And also John, the son of Zach- 
arias, which Zacharias he (Elias) vis- 
ited and gave promise that he should 
have a son and his name should be 
John, and he should be filled with the 
spirit of Elias; 

8. Which John I have sent unto you 
my servants Joseph 'Smith Jr., and 
Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto 
this Priesthood, which you have re- 
ceived that you might be called and or- 
dained even as Aaron: 

9. And also Elijah unto whom I have 
committed the keys of the power of 
turning the hearts of the fathers to the 
children, and the hearts of the children 
to the fathers, that the whole earth 
may not be smitten with a curse: 

10. And also with Joseph and Jacob 
and Isaac, and Abraham, your fathers', 
by whom the promises remain; 

11. And also with Michael, or Adam, 
the father of all, the prince of all, the 
ancient of days. 

12. And also with Pater, and James, 
and John, whom I have sent unto you, 
by whom I have ordained you and con- 
firmed you to be Apostles and especial 
witnesses of my name, and bear the 
keys of your ministry, and of the same 
things which I revealed unto them: 

13. Unto whom I have committed the 
keys of my kingdom, and a dispensa- 
tion of the Oospel for the last times, 



and for the fulness of times in the 
which I will gather together in one all 
things, both which are in heaven and 
which are on earth: 

14. And also with all those whom my 
Father hath given me ouit of the world: 

15. Wherefore, lift up your hearts and 
rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take 
upon you my whole armor, that ye may 
be able to withstand the evil day, hav- 
ing done all ye may be able to stand. 

16. Stand, therefore, having your 
loins girt about with truth, having on 
the breastplate of righteousness, and 
your feet shod with the preparation of 
the Gospel of peace which I have sent 
mine angels to commit unto you. 

17. Taking the shield of faith, where- 
with ye shall be able to quench all the 
fiery darts of the wicked; 

18. And take the helmet of salvation 
and the sword of my spirit which I 
will pour out upon you, and my word 
which I reveal unto you and be agreed 
as touching all things whatsoever ye 
ask of me, and be faithful until I come, 
and ye shall be caught up, that where 
I am ye shall be also. Amen. 

We have the testimony of the Lord 
as to His having established HisChurch 
upon earth, having restored to the 
earth the Melchisedek Priesthood and 
Apostleship, and given unto man power- 
on the earth to preach His Gospel and 
to administer in the ordinances of His 
house, and we are His witnesses. I can 
also bear witness to the truth of the 
expression of President Joseph F. 
Smith this morning with regard to men, 
besides the general authorities, being 
anxious concerning this work. I know 
that men are anxious concerning this 
work, those that are living their relig- 
ion, living the principles of righteous- 
ness. I know the Latter-day Saints are 
not guilty of whoredoms and abomina- 
tions, and fornications and adultery; it 
would be impossible for the Latter-day 
Saints to be guilty of anything of the \ 
kind, for a Saint is a man who is 
sanctified, who has accepted the prin- 
ciples of redemption, whom God has re- 
deemed from death. A Saint is a man 
or a woman that worships the living 
and true God in the name of Jesus 
Christ, who acknowledges His hand in 
all things, who has repented of sins 
and gone forth into the waters of bap-

tism and been immersed in the likeness 
of the burial of Christ and His resur- 
rection, and who has received the effi- 
cacy of the precious blood of Christ, 
and who has received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, and who has the fellow- 
ship of the Holy Ghost. Well, now it 
would be impossible for them to be 
adulterers, fornicators— just impossible. 
I want you to distinctly understand 
that the kingdom of God is like a man 
that went and sowed wheat and his 
enemy came and sowed tares, >and we 
have the wheat and tares growing up 
with the wheat, and the wheat gets the 
character of the tares; but it is not so; 
it is the pure in heart that love God; it 
is the pure in heart that love the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel; it is the pure in 
heart that are faithful in the testimony 
of Jesus, and in the saying and doing 
of His will and the keeping of His com- 
mandments; they love righteousness 
and hate iniquity; and every man that 
hath the hope of a glorious resurrec- 
tion, that hath the hope of the Lord 
Jesus Christ; that hath the hope of His 
kingdom to come, purifieth himself, 
even as God is pure; and they seek to 
become perfect; they strive to be hon- 
est and upright and full of integrity; 
they strive to keep the commandments 
of God for their own dear sakes in or- 
der that they may please God . If they 
do not do that, what (worth are they? 
The ancient prophets were anxious that 
they should get this testimony that 
they pleased God. My anxiety is com- 
mon with the Latter-day Saints; we 
are in our humble way striving to serve 
God and keep His commandments, l 
came out of the world for this, That is 
why, perchance, I appreciate it so 
much, to think that my Father should 
draw me into His fold; that He should 
give me the privilege of the schooling 
and experience that I have had since 
the year 1852. 
i "We had a powerful testimony at the 
organization of the Presidency. We 
did not meet together with any such 
f eeling or idea in our hearts, that the 
Presidency should then be organized, 
but our Father in heaven by the power 
of His Spirit demonstrated unto us in- 
dividually that it was His will; we 
knew it; we had the testimony. When 
I embraced this Gospel President 



Young was presiding, and I have had 
my experience under Brigham Young, 
John Taylor, Wilford Woodrvff, and 
Lorenzo Snow. I know that tnese men 
are men of God. I know that they were 
pure in heart, and that they are pure 
in heart. I know that their disposition 
is the love of righteousness. They have 
endeavored, like the rest of us, to 
glorify God in their good works, and to 
seek to establish His righteousness. 
That is what we are striving in our 
humble way to do. 

I know that the Lord hears and an- 
swers prayers. I know the infidels ridi- 
cule the idea of prayer— the idea of ask- 
ing a blessing on the food. I think it is 
very consistent for the man that rever- 
ences God and acknowledges His hano: 
in all things, who realizes that the Lord 
provides, and who understands this in 
his experience, to say: "Our Father, 
which art in heaven we thank Thee for 
this food, and pray Thee to bless it to 
the healing and nourishing of our 
bodies, and let Thy Spirit be in our 
hearts, and guide and direct us as Thy 
children, in the name of Jesus. Amen." 
What is there curious about that? Is it 
curious that a man should have that 
faith and confidence in God? And then 
knowing his own weaknesses and his 
own inability, that he should plead be- 
fore the Lord in the name of Jesus 
Christ for the fellowship of His Spirit, 
for His protecting care, for His divine 
light, and more, for the testimony that 
we know that God lives, and that we 
know that Jesus is the Christ; that He 
has established His Churcn on the 
earth; that we have been the happy re- 
cipients ' of its blessings? "I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it 
is the power of God unto salvation, for 
herein is the righteousness of God re- 
vealed from faith to faith." There is no 
happiness in this world that is superior 
to the happiness of the man or woman 
that loves God and keeps His com- 
mandments. 

And again, we ought to be just; we 
want to have a part in the resurrec- 
tion of the just. There are two resur- 
rections, the resurrection of the just 
and the resurrection of the unjust, and 
individually we will have a part in one 
of these resurrections. Now we want 
to be just for our own sakes; we want

to be honest, to be upright and to pay 
our just debts, so that we may owe 
no man anything. We want to be 
just in all of our actions to all men and 
to treat all men right whether they see 
as we do or not — it does not make any 
difference, they are our brethren. There 
was a time when we did not see, nor 
understand, and we don't know what 
may be in the future for them. Paul 
was a persecutor of the Saints, and the 
Lord Jesus Christ called unto Him, 
"Why persecutest thou me?" Perse- 
cuting the Lord Jeans? Why, yes, when 
they persecute the Latter-day Saints 
they persecute the Lord Jesus, for we 
are His. We do not represent our- 
selves, we represent Him. We plead 
with the people in Christ's stead to bo 
fully reconciled to God. These are our 
pleadings all the time. 

I am thankful for the privilege of 
bearing my testimony at this Confer- 
ence; and when we say I know that 
this work is of the Lord, we mean, I 
know that God has established His 
Church upon the earth with Apostles, 
and Prophets, and Evangelists, and 
Teachers, and Pastors, and for the 
work of the ministry and for the edi- 
fying of the body of Christ. I know 
it. I knew it a good many years ago, 
and I have a living testimony of this 
lact, and so have you, so have you my 
beloved brethren and sisters. I walked 
down with a young man on the side- 
walk, and in conversing with him com- 
ing to meeting, his testimony and con- 
versation carried me back to the time 
when I was of his age— just as devoted 
as I knew how to be; fond of being 
in the Sunday school; fond of being in 
the Young Men's Mutual Improve- 
ment assoailaitiioins, and I'm the quorums 
of 'the Priesthood; und of being faithful 
in tithes and offerings, and in sustain- 
ing the Priesthood; striving to iteep 
clean from the blood and sins of this 
generation; and this reminded me of 
the testimony of President Joseph F. 
Smith. He remembers that when he 
held no authority in this Church he 



was just as devoted to the cause of 
truth as he knew how to be. It seems 
that it is natural for some men to serve 
God and keep His commandments; 
they have that disposition, and they 
love righteousness. I say that the 
Latter-day Saints are a righteous peo- 
ple. This is my testimony. I am 
laboring with them all the time and 
have been for a number of years, as I 
have said, and for most of the time 
have been more or less engaged in the 
ministry. I feel thankful to God my 
eternal Father beyond expression for 
the testimony that He has given to me, 
for the schooling and experience vou- 
chsafed unto me, and I pray God that 
His blessings may be continued unto 
those holding His authority. 

I have all the confidence in the world 
in President Lorenzo Snow. Why? 
Simply because for a number of years 
I have been under his schooling in con- 
nection with my brethren of the 
Twelve. We know his worth; we 
know that it has been a great benefit 
and blessing unto us; we know it in 
our experience, and our hearts go out 
to him with all the affection possible, 
for "we know that we have passed 
from death unto life, because we love 
the brethren;" we do, and we sustain 
them by our faith and prayers because 
we love them. 

My beloved fellow-laborers, God bless 
you, and give us faith and power that 
we may be true in our integrity, that 
we may never flinch, that we may be 
enabled to remain and endure to the 
end, that when we have flniished our 
probation on earth, we may enter into 
that glorious rest that is promised un- 
to all those that love God and keep 
His commandments, through Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

Come, come, ye Saints, nor toll nor 
labor fear. 

Benediction by Elder Joseph E. 
Taylor. 

Conference adjourned till Sunday 
morning, Oct. 9th, at 10 a. m.

BXiDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Benefits of Conference — Instruction of the youth — 
Family Influence— Force of example— Testimony 
to the Gospel. 

My brethren and sisters, I have en- 
joyed the opportunity of meeting with 
you in this Conference and in seeing 
the spirit that is manifest on the part 
of the Saints from all parts of the coun- 
try where they are located, in striving 
to be represented here upon this occa- 
sion. Gatherings such as we have twice 
a year, bringing us from all parts of 
the land, enable us to renew our old 
acquaintanceship, and form new friend- 
ships, look into each other's faces, and 
drink in of the spirit that pervades 
each district of country from which we 
come. If we utilize properly the talents 
that our Father in heaven has given 
us, all on their return to their homes 
and neighborhoods will carry with 
them a spirit of improvement, and a 
determination, so far as practicable, 
to awaken in their district the deter- 
mination to more fully meet the obliga- 
tions and requirements of the faith 
that we have espoused. 

We can only judge fairly by compari- 
son; and by these associations that are 
offered us the opportunity for that com- 
parison is opened up unto us — gathering 
new thoughts and ideas, and comparing 
conditions as they exist with ourselves, 
and as they exist, and are seen and felt 
in the companionship and spirit of 
other sections' of our country. We can 
go forth renewed in spirit, aroused in 
our determination to see that the sec- 



tions from which we come are fully up 
to the standard, as presented in other 
sections of the country, and in the ex- 
pression of sentiment given to us as we 
shall meet former acquaintances, and 
of the hopes and fears 'that we our- 
selves entertain, and that are manifest 
in the expressions of others whom we 
love and with whom we probably min- 
gled in former days. 

The Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
we are informed by the sacred scrip- 
tures, is "the power of God unto salva- 
tion." There are none of us that can 
question this statement made in former 
times, who have received the impress 
of that spirit upon which some of the 
brethren have spoken during the former 
sessions of this conference. It, without 
doubt, meant fully the adoption of 
rules, the acceptance of principles, the 
establishment of a standard, that 
should guide and govern our lives, or 
the lives of former day Saints while 
they were sojourning upon the earth, 
and that preparation necessary to pre- 
pare us for the conditions that exist be- 
yond the veil. Therefore, when we con- 
sider the basis of the f aith that we have 
espoused, and that the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ is indeed the power 
of God unto salvation, each one of us 
can look into our oiwn souls; we know 
the temptations and trials and beset- 
ments of our own lives; we have a full 
understanding of our own weaknesses! 
and under that faith which the Lord 
has given us in the acceptance of His 
holy Gospel, we start in to so fully and 
thoroughly educate ourselves in the un- 
derstanding of the same, that when- 
ever we comply with each condition, 
fulfill each and every obligation, there 
is registered in our own souls, by the 
spirit of our Father the word of ap- 
proval; and 'whenever, perchance, in 
the performance of our part, and the 
discharge of the various duties and ob- 
ligations 'that rest upon us, we fall be- 
low the fulfillment of the sacred duties 
that we have promised to obey, there 
is within us the feeling of dissatisfac- 
tion, of uncertainty, and of doubt.

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, 
those 'that have received of the impress 
of the heavenly gift, who have been 
partakers of that Gospel which is to be 
the power of God unto salvation to 
every one that shall obey and fulfill its 
requirements, the opportunities present- 
ed in our gathering- together upon these 
occasions, in marking the way of oui 
advancement by comparison with oth- 
ers, actuated by like hope, established 
in like determination, and pressing for- 
ward to the accomplishment of the 
same purposes.renew within us that de- 
termination, and increase the spirit and 
feeling to do and be indeed the children 
of the Father who sent us here. There 
is but little doubt that there are many 
people who, standing in our organiza- 
tion as members of the Church of 
Christ, are not fully converted to our 
principles; there are quite a number, as 
all of us know who are conversant with 
the actual conditions that exist among 
the people everywhere, who are in that 
frame of mind that they have accepted 
of the faith, because their parents ac- 
cepted it. There are some who have 
been impressed with the idea that the 
doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints conform to the 
doctrines of the Scripture, and conform- 
ing to them, they acepted of them upon 
this basis, without the particular ef- 
fort, or necessary effort to secure foi 
themselves 'the witness of the spirit of 
that Gospel. They rejoice in the evi- 
dences that are manifest upon some 
occasions in discussions or debates 
wherein the Scriptures are utilized as 
an argument in connection with our fel- 
low men to the destruction and over- 
throw of views that they may have en- 
tertained; but there are those who re- 
ceive from the divine source the wit- 
ness of that spirit which brings convic- 
tion to every fibre of the human being; 
that writes upon the heart; that fixea 
'itself upon the brain; that establishes 
itself in such a form that no matter 
what the circumstances or conditions 
are in life it is written there not to be 
effaced; and no matter where the indi- 
viduals might be, or what the circum- 
stances were, their witness for the truth 
would be given in humility relying upon 
the mercies and goodness of their Heav- 
enly Father. 



We are acquitting ourselves as a peo- 
ple very nobly in the efforts that we are 
making in scattering the seeds of the 
Gospel among the nations of the earth. 
Our brothers, our fathers, our sons, are 
performing their duties in this respect 
.with heroic courage and fortitude; -but 
when we look into the internal con- 
cerns of our country and s>tate and see 
the needs and necessities of hosts of oui 
young men especially (when I use the 
word hosts, I use it in the sense that 
there are many) who are moral, up- 
right, earnest, and devoted, so far as 
that is concerned to the regular duties 
and responsibilities of life, but whose 
minds have net been touched with the 
sacred fire, whose hearts have gone out 
in the various directions in the accom- 
plishment of their walks in life, so far 
as the temporal duties of life are con- 
cerned, and who have been led to think 
perchance father and mother, carried 
away in their enthusiasm for the faith 
that they have espoused, are not alto- 
gether in that condition or frame of 
mind that would impress them with 
that which seems so dear to father and 
mother, we realize that every effort 
made in the direction of the improve- 
ment and establishment in their minds 
of a proper understanding of the Gos- 
pel is a duty we owe to them. I realize 
that in our anxiety sometimes as par- 
ents in these matters, the constant fol- 
lowing of our sons, the constant effort 
to impress them with the same relig- 
ious fire that has been aroused in our 
breasts, may in some instances be over- 
done, as remarked to me upon one oc- 
casion by an eminent man in our na- 
tion who classes himself as an infidel. 
"I became infidel," he remarked, "to the 
faith of my fathers for the reason of 
the strict anxiety upon the part gf 
father and mother to impress me with 
their faith." While this should not be 
an excuse on the part of men for dis- 
regarding the wishes of moral fathers 
and mothers, who sought to impress 
upon the minds of their children the 
sacred obligation they owed to their 
Father in heaven, there may be in some 
few instances cause for complaint on 
the part of thoughtless boys and 
thoughtless girls in connection with 
this matter. It seems to me that the 
proper application of our home govern- 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men!, the seeking to secure the aid and 
assistance of the boys and the girls in 
the discharge of the duties of that 
home, in their taking part in family 
prayer, in their assisting in the saying 
of grace at the table, in their being 
kindly and gently pled with, in striv-. 
ing to awaken in their minds that sa- 
cred reverence or love for the Supreme 
Being, would bridge most of the 
chasms that are found in the way ot 
the development of legitimate and 
proper faith in the minds of some of 
the thoughtless ones. 

I am a believer in the thought that 
the sons and daughters of the Latter- 
day Saints are not recreant to their 
faith, or to the faith of their fathers. 
I recognize the fact in my own experi- 
ence, as I note the conditions that arise 
in many lives, that while there is a 
thoughtless period that attends every 
boy and every girl, when 'they pass a 
certain stage in their history, their 
hearts turn to their home and to the 
influences of that home, and to the 
efforts that were made to impress them 
in that home with a sacred regard for 
the name of their Heavenly Father, and 
for the sacred laws that He has given. 
And inasmuch as we fulfill the require- 
ments placed upon us to teach our sons 
and daughters the principles of that 
Gospel, that power of God unto salva- 
tion; have sought to establish within 
them honesty; have sought to fix upon 
their minds that justice and mercy 
and propriety and wisdom should gov- 
ern them as the seeds are sown; as 
their minds are guarded; as their 
hearts are cultivated; as they are up- 
lifted in their being by the upright- 
ness and consistency and prudence of 
the examples of their fathers and moth- 
ers, one by one they will find them- 
selves taking their place in the ranks 
of that religion that God has called to 
aid in carrying forth the truths of the 
Gospel which He has given to us in our 
day. 

I desire, my brethren and sisters that 
you will consider these matters; that 
there shall be adopted in the regula- 
tions of every home that wisdom and 
prudence that should characterize the 
Bishop of a ward, the Teachers of 
blocks, the High Priests, Seventies and 
Elders, and all that class of men who 



have been made partakers of the heav- 
enly gift, that the spirit of truth, 
striking our own souls and vibrating 
therein, shall make its way among the 
children of men; that all who may en- 
ter our home circle or our neighbor- 
hood circle, shall feel and see that our 
hearts are in attune to the principles of 
right, mercy, and justice and the prin- 
ciples of propriety in everything that 
tends to turn and make man and wo* 
man more noble and true. 

In connection with my brethren, I 
desire to bear my testimony to the 
truth Of the Gospel, and the sacredness 
of that mission given of God in the in- 
troduction of this work, and to the up- 
rightness and honesty and determina- 
tion that exist on the part of those you 
have sustained as guides in connection 
with this work, and to the spirit of love 
engendered in their breasts for the 
work of God and the extension of the 
principles of the Gospel on the lines of 
justice and right so far as it is possible 
for man with his weaknesses to walk 
in harmony with the wishes of our 
Father in heaven. I bear you my wit- 
ness that this is indeed the Gospel of 
Christ; that it will be indeed a power 
of God unto salvation to every man and 
every woman that shall adopt its rules 
and walk in the way marked out by 
the revealed will of our Father in the 
day and age in which we live. That 
God may bless you all, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER F. M. LTMAN. 

Organization of the Church in harmony with the 
will of God— Man is that he might be saved- 
Favorable time? for the Saints— Man's obligations 
to his Maker first — Young people should marry— 
Time snould be economized for righteousness. 

It affords me much pleasure, my 
brethren and sisters, to meet with you 
on this important occasion — the day on 
Which is to be 'consummated the begin- 
ning of a new administration in the 
Church under President Lorenzo Snow 
and his brethren. This great body of 
people gathered from all directions give 
evidence that the work of the Lord is 
still alive in the earth; that this Church 
is growing, gaining strength and poweii 
spreading .abroad in the earth, 'accom- 
plishing the design of our Heavenly

Father. Our children and those whp 
are brought into the Church, from 
abroad add strength to this great work, 
and the Lord will fulfill His purposes. 
His favor and blessing are over the peo- 
ple, and they are being established; the 
stakes of Zion are increasing, the wards, 
the quorums, the associations and the 
missions are increasing in the earth, 
and we are the witnesses that the gifts 
and graces of theGospel attend upon the 
ministry of the Lord's servants. The 
will of the Lord is made known to the 
people, and they are not long left in 
doubt, or to wonder or surmise; for we 
have attained that degree of humility, 
union and faith that insures to all Israel 
the mind of the Lord in regard to His 
purposes. It is manifest in our present 
experience how readily all Israel has dis- 
covered and learned from the Lord His 
mind in regard to the Presidency of the 
Church, and the steps that are neces- 
sary to be taken in order that the or- 
ganization of the Church may be com- 
plete and perfect; for as long as the 
Church is under the necessity of mov- 
ing without the chief presiding quorum 
—the three High Priests designated by 
the Father and sustained by the peo- 
ple — the organization is not complete.; 
and in order that the Church may have 
all the blessings ,the gifts and graces, 
the inspiration and favor of God, it is 
quite desirable that every department 
of this Church should be in complete 
organization. I say that in this move- 
ment that we have witnessed, and that 
we witness today, is an evidence that 
the Church is advancing, that the peo- 
ple are becoming schooled and better 
tried and proven in the doctrines and 
discipline of the Church.. The Lord has 
spoken to His Prophets and Apostles, 
and has announced His will; and today 
the world shall see that Israel is a 
united people, that they see eye to eye, 
and in your hearts, my brethren 
and sisters, as well as in ours, shall be 
the evidence, positive and unquestion- 
able, that the mind and will of God 
has been spoken from the heavens. Let 
every Latter-day Saint in hie and her 
own heart ask the Father that he or 
she may really feel and know, by the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that the 
organization of this Church is in har- 
mony with the mind and will of the 



45 

Father; and those who> thus seek the 
will of God shall know it in their hearts 
and souls. 

The work is advancing; it is growing 
apace and spreading quietly in the 
earth; the Gospel is being preachod; 
the people gathered and established; 
the resources and facilities of Zion are 
developing on every hand, and we are 
becoming a very remarkable people. 
The Lord will magnify and sustain 
His people; He will correct them, re- 
prove them, restrain them, and inspire 
them. He will inspire every man who 
bears responsibility in this Church. 
Every man presiding in missions abroad 
every man laboring abroad and lift- 
ing his voice to the world, calling upon 
all men to repent and- turn unto the 
Lord, will be sustained by the power of 
God; and those who preside at home, 
in the organizations of Priesthood, in 
the stakes, in the wards, in the associ- 
ations and organizations of our bretn- 
ren and sisters, will all be blessed and 
sustained. We will learn valuable les- 
sons at times, no doubt, by the things 
we suffer, and sometimes possibly by 
the mistakes we make. But the Lord 
knows our hearts, our conduct, and our 
thoughts, and He will purge us *aid 
prove us, and will save us to the utter- 
most, if We will but be saved. It is the 
design of the Father that all His chil- 
dren should be Saved. Men were not 
created to be damned; but they were 
created to be saved. Men have come 
to the earth and obtained their bodies 
that they might be saved, that they 
may be enlarged and developed, and 
that they m'ay walk in the footsteps of 
our Elder Brother, Jesus, to salvation. 
In Him we should discover the very ex- 
ample of purity, of humility and of 
obedience to God that should be fol- 
lowed by each of us. It will be neces- 
sary, if we would be the heirs of God 
and joint heirs with the Son, rhlat as He 
had but the will of God, so must we 
also have the will of God. Our wills 
must be subject to the will of the 
Father; that What the Father wills in 
regard to us, We should will — it Should 
be our will; for He only wills good to 
us, lif e, prosperity, peace and salvation, 
in time and in eternity. We can well 
afford to exchange our wills for the will 
of God — or, rather, that our wills should 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be as the will of God; that we should 
adopt the will of God as our will. '"Not 
my will, Father, but thine be done." 
For the will of God is superior xo our 
will. He knows what will be good for 
us; He knows what is good for us. He 
knows what will preserve us and will 
save us from the power of Satan, from 
the grasp of that personage who would 
drag us down into the same condition 
that he is in. The Lord knows exactly 
what is best for us; and what our Elder 
Brother has accomplished and attained 
to — we also are the sons of God, the 
junior brethren and the sisters of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, and He designs that 
we should come up as He came up, and 
accomplish what He has accomplished, 
and be worthy of the favor .and blessing 
of our Heavenly Father in time and in 
eternity, and this can only be obtained 
by serving the Lord, as He serves our 
Heavenly Father. 

Then, my brethren and sisters, it is 
very important that we should learn to 
live unitedly, to be humble, to be faith- 
ful in the discharge of the duties that 
devolve upon us, and to fulfill the re- 
quirements of our Heavenly Father. 
Now we are entering upon times and 
conditions that are to be favorable to 
the Church, and favorable to everybody 
else. Good times are coming upon the 
people — prosperous times. As we have 
been so. abundantly blessed this year, 
so may we be blessed the coming year, 
and so on for the future. And when 
the blessings of the Lord are so abund- 
antly bestowed upon us, we ought to 
make good use of them. We ought to 
listen to the counsel of wisdom, and to 
profit by our past experience, to refrain 
from contracting obligations that we 
are unable to meet. The Latter-day 
Saints should begin now, if they have 
not already, to meet all their obliga- 
tions. I believe with the favorable con- 
ditions that are opening up to us and 
to the people of the world, that we 
ought to learn to meet our obligations; 
free ourselves from mortgages entirely. 
The Lord will open the way if we will 
make good use of the blessings that He 
has bestowed upon us, that we may 
meet all our obligations.. But remem- 
ber the Lord first! I am frequently ap- 
proached by brethren to know what 
they shall do. "If I pay my tithing, I 



have other obligations and embarrass- 
ments that weigh me down. Shall I, 
under these circumstances, pay my ob- 
ligations to the Lord?" I say, Yes. 
First of all a man should meet his ob- 
ligations to his Maker -He who has 
furnished us the earth upon which we 
live, .and all the wealth thereof. We 
ought to remember our obligations to 
Him; for we are in this work for eternal 
salvation and exaltation, eternal life, 
and to become the heirs of God, through 
our faithfulness, that whatever of 
wealth the Lord possesses we shall be 
His heirs, and joint heirs with the Son, 
Who has received from the Father all 
things and all power in heaven and on 
earth. If we would be sharers in this, 
we must remember first our obligations 
to the Lord; for they are older than the 
obligations to any man. Pay the obli- 
gations in the order of their seniority 
—as they are due. First meet all our 
obligations to the Lord properly, and 
then tell the Father that we want to 
be conscientious and honest with every- 
body else— with our brothers and our 
sisters as we are with Him, Now is the 
time that we manifest our faith in the 
Lord, and prove Him; and I want to 
bear record that no man has ever failed 
to. find the promises of the Lord relia- 
ble. No man has ever paid his tithing 
properly but what has been abundantly 
blessed. I want to say, too, that no 
man has ever paid his just obligation* 
to his brother but what he has been 
abundantly blessed. There is a compen- 
sation that always comes in answer io 
the performance of every right and 
proper duty between man and his 
Maker, between man and his brother; 
for I say that a man will not be honest 
with his Maker if he be not honest with 
his brother. Be honest with the Lord 
and then honest with the brethren. 
Be honest with the world, and con- 
scientious with them in all our 
obligations and covenants; for they are 
our brethren— unbaptized, so far as that 
is concerned, but they are our brethren, 
the sons and the daughters of God, and 
our conduct, our dealings, contracts and 
business obligations with them should 
be most conscientious, honest and up- 
right. If so, then they will see that we 
are conscientious and honest in our 
dealings with our father in heaven. They

will have confidence in us, and will be- 
lieve our professions. Then, I say, 
brethren and sisters, remember the 
Lord in these time's. Let us go forward 
and discharge the duties tha't devolve 
upon us. It is a splendid time now to 
pay our debts. 

It is a splendid time now, also, for 
the young people to enter into marriage. 
Young men and young women who are 
twenty years of age and upwards 
should see to it. Parents: 'should advise 
and counsel with them, that they should 
enter into marriage. The Latter-day 
Saints are a people that believe in the 
principle of marriage. They believe it 
is one of the most sacred command- 
ments and requirementsi of the Lord 
that men and women should marry, and 
should multiply and replenish the earth, 
and fill it with the son's and daughters 
of God, training and leading them in 
the ways of righteousness by their ex- 
ample and by their instructions. Let me 
exhort you, my brethren and sisters, 
Bishops, Presidents, leading men, moth- 
ers in Israel see to it that your sons 
and daughters and those under your 
care are thoroughly taught in regard 
to this principle. We are not a people 
with one idea only; not alone the Word 
of Wisdom, not alone the law of tithing; 
but the law of marriage, the law of hon- 
esty, of virtue, of charity and of up- 
rightness among the people and be- 
tween each other. We believe in all 
these doctrines, and we believe that if 
a man would be saved and exalted in the 
celestial kingdom of God he must do all 
that it is possible for man to do. All 
the requirements of the Lord must be 
accomplished if we would attain to all 
that is to be obtained in the celestial 
kingdom of our Father. And every 
Latter-day Saint has started out for 
that— the obtaining of eternal life, and 
the greatest degree of glory that can 
be obtained in the celestial kingdom. 
Then to obtain this I say that the full 
and perfect law of the Father must be 
observed. We are to be rewarded fof 
our works. We must earn what we ob- 
tain. We have our sins upon us and we 
cannot atone for them ourselves; they 
have been atoned for by the Son of 
God. But we must repent of them, 
which we can do. Every man can re- 
Pent who will; for the spirit of repent- 



ance, a gift of God, waits upon the chil- 
dren of men, as does the light of day, 
as does air, heat and cold, and all these 
conditions that attend closely upon the 
movements of mankind. So does th<» 
spirit of faith, of humility, of 
righteousness and virtue always at- 
tend upon the people. These 
two spirits are anxious that 
we should entertain them. Why will we 
not? R is according to the will of man 
that he turns against the truth and 
closes his heart against it. The truth 
may be here abundantly on every hand, 
and we can close our hearts against it. 
Let us not do this, my brethren a,nd 
sisters. It is only a little season that 
we live here. This probation of ours is 
very brief. I discover this when I find 
that in a little time I shall be an old 
man, ready to pass away; and my 
brethren the same. Now I have passed 
half a hundred, and when men get to 
that age they become old men, and xt te* 
that their race to the end is very rapid; 
they get old in a very short time; years 
and periods become brief. Now we 
want to be prepared, and remember 
that it is only a little span. Ninety 
years, such as President Woodruff ived", 
will be looked upon, when he passes be- 
yond and looks back over his career of 
the past in mortality, as just a brief, 
brief span. It would seem as though 
we could almost hold our breath that 
long, to get over without doing anything 
that is wrong. Let us shun evil. Let 
us seek to know the mind and will of 
the Lord, obtain the Holy Ghost and en- 
joy it all the day long, and the Lord will 
lead us gently home. Oh! whaJt joy and 
happiness there is when we are serving 
God with full purpose of heart all the 
time, when sin ceases to afflict us, when 
temptations and trials are kept far 
from us. The path is straight, it is nar- 
row, but it is easy and most pleasant. 
Let us try and walk it, and be faithful 
in the discharge of every duty. 

I want to testify to you in regard to 
this work. It is the work of our Father 
who dwells in heaven. It is the work 
established by Him, and not by man. 
When I hear the brethren say, as was 
testified to here by Brother John Henry 
Smith, that the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is the power of God unto 
salvation, I say to myself, Why tne 
Christian world acknowledge that. But 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the question in the Christian world Is, 
where is the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ that is the power of God unto 
salvation? - I would testify to afll this 
'great assembly here — brothers, sisters, 
friends, strangers — that the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ which is the 
power of God unto salvation was re- 
stored in its ancient power and purity 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith. We 
possess it today. We have the Priest- 
hood of God, which is His authority and 
power. It is in the . earth, and with all 
our imperfections, weaknesses and fol- 
lies, yet hath the Lord maintained us, 
and He will do if we are fairly faithful. 
The more faithful we are the* more will 
we witness the power of God and the 
more readily will everything be accom- 
plished that comes along which needs 
the attention, of the Lord and of His 
servants; the more readily and perfect- 
ly will every gap be filled, and you will 
find the Church of God will move so 
regularly and smoothly along that there 
will never be a ripple. We may have a 
rough road to travel over, as we have 
had in the past; we may have difficul- 
ties and trials, and the world may be 
measurably arrayed against us, and try 
to destroy us or do us harm, feeling all 
the time, no doubt, in their hearts that 
they are doing the greatest possible 
good and are anxious for our salvation; 
but I want to say to you that our 
Father who dwells in heaven — that 
Father whom Jesus taught His disciples 
to pray to, "Our Father, which art in 
heaven" — that same great Parent over- 
looks these affairs, and is guiding and 
controlling the destinies of this people, 
as He is the destinies of all other peo- 
ple; and with this people abides today 
that Gospel which is the power of God 
unto 1 salvation, and it will endure and 
accomplish what the Lord has designed 
it shall accomplish — the salvation of the 
children of men, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 
Instructions should embrace temporal as well as 
spiritual subjects— Some duties of officers of 
the Church and of parents — Avoid evil speaking 
and contention— Periodicity of times of plenty 
and scarcity. Husband the products of the 
earth. 

I would like your attention, my breth- 
ren and sisters, for the few moments 



that I may stand before you, for I be- 
lieve it is difficult to make all of this 
vast congregation hear the words of the 
speaker. Some very good things have 
been said in testimony and otherwise 
which have been lost to a portion of the 
congregation; but I believe if we were 
quiet throughout this building that it 
would not be very difficult to hear an 
ordinary voice in every part of it. 

I have rejoiced exceedingly during the 
meetings that have been held here and 
have listened with attention to the re- 
marks of my brethren. Great things 
have been said; great ideas have been 
advanced; great principles have been 
dwelt upon, for our brethren have 
spoken of those things that pertain to 
eternal life. I have felt to say in my 
heart: if we have not the Gospel, the 
Lord have mercy upon us, for our fel- 
low-men will not have mercy, the world 
will not have mercy upon this people; 
but if, as we testify, we have the Gos- 
pel of the Son of God, who can prevail 
against us? Not the world, nor the ad- 
versary of our souls, if we live in har- 
mony with the revelations of God that 
He has given unto us. I know that we 
have the Gospel of the Son of God. I 
do not know that I will be saved in His 
celestial kingdom, but I know that He 
has revealed to me all that is necessary, 
in the past and the present, and will 
reveal unto me, personally, and by the 
instructions of my brethren, all that is 
necessary to guide me in the future, 
that I may return back into His pres- 
ence. I know this to be so; that it is 
the truth; and my desire for you is like 
the desire I have for myself, to again 
meet with you in the presence of our 
eoramoo Father in. His celestial king- 
dom. 

If people expect that we, who are here 
in these stands, are to confine ourselves 
to- the spiritual necessities of the king- 
dom of God, they are somewhat mis- 
taken. We have to deal with that 
which is before us, the every day life 
which we live in the localities where our 
homes and interests are situated. We 
can come here and feel well for a short 
time, but if we lay aside the spirit we 
obtain at these conferences, and which 
we will find in our meetings at home 
if we attend them— if we lay that spirit 
aside, the course of life will seem too 



ELDER BRIG HAM 10UNG.

strong for us. I never saw a time in 
my life, in my experience, when it was 
more necessary to be humble in prayer, 
in public, in private, and in family wor- 
ship than at 'the present time. I never 
saw a time in the history of this 
Church, so far as my knowledge ex- 
tends, wben we were more tempted to 
omit these commandments of the Lord; 
something intervenes, something pre- 
vents the husband and the wife from 
gathering their families, their children, 
in their household and observing this 
duty. O, I haven't time to pray this 
morning. The temptation is great to 
omit it. I . testify unto this congrega- 
tion that if you will go to your homes 
throughout the length and breadth of 
the land and will humbly seek your 
Father in prayer and in supplication, in 
private and in public, as your duty may 
call and the spirit direct, that you will 
grow and increase and life will become 
a ten-fold pleasure to you. I testify to 
you that you will create a sentiment 
and a feeling in the hearts 'of your sons 
and daughters that you will marvel at, 
and rejoice to see the reformation that 
will take place in all the households of 
the Latter-day Saints who observe this 
simple duty. Try it. Let every man 
and every woman go from this Confer- 
ence with a determination to observe 
these requirement's which God has 
made of them. We go into the Stakes 
and visit the people a great deal, and 
we find much that needs talking about. 
In some Stakes that I have visited in 
the past— I will say in the last year — 
I find occasionally that the President of 
the Stake has lost his grip to some ex- 
tent, lost 'his influence, and that there 
are opposing forces arrayed against 
him among his brethren, and sisters-— 
that tie his hands, to a great extent. 
Why these people have a power. One 
of the brethren said that when he faced 
the people before him, who are in the 
image of our God and our Savior, it 
made him tremble. These people have 
a force and a power. If you are not in 
sympathy with me when I stand here 
to teach you, then I have no influence. 
You have this power in your wards, in 
your societies and in your associations. 

In visiting some of the wards I have 
had the pleasure of visiting the Relief 
Societies, and I asked one person in re- 



lation to the visits of the Bishop to 
their meetings. "Why," the president 
said to me, "the Bishop never visits us; 
he never attends our meetings." Here 
is a neglect on the part of the Bishop 
in something that is very essential, and 
they should repent of this, and every 
meeting that is held, every interest of 
that ward, should be his especial care, 
and make it his duty to supervise it as 
far as need be, and be in perfect har- 
mony with them and have them in per- 
fect harmony with him in all their 
labors. I go again to the Sabbath 
school, and on one occasion I said to the 
presiding officer: "Who are those little 
boys on those back benches?" "Why," 
he said to me in a whisper, "those are 
our hoodlums. We work with them as 
best we can. You see that brother is 
a mild tempered man. He sits right 
there by those little fellows trying to 
keep them in order; and we use every 
effort and all the persuasion that we are 
capable of to get them to observe order, 
but I tell you, Brother Young, with all 
they get from here, their parents are 
indifferent as to what their children do. 
Parents neglect their children and they 
run hither and thither all the week long 
and when they come into the Sabbath 
school it is almost useless to try to keep 
them quiet and orderly for the little fel- 
lows have been neglected and disorderly 
the whole week." Fathers and mothers 
do not second the efforts of these excel- 
lent, disinterested teachers who go Sab- 
bath after Sabbath to their Sunday 
schools, and seek to inform their chil- 
dren's minds that they may grow up 
useful men and women in the Church of 
Christ. There is a neglect in this de- 
partment throughout the length and 
breadth of the land. Will the people of 
this Conference go from here and take 
up these subjects and say in their 
hearts: With the help of God we wtfll 
aid the Sabbath schools, for they can- 
not do it all? The president of a Sltake 
cannot do everything; the Bishop can- 
not do everything; but we are all 
neglectful in some things, and here are 
evils that must be corrected. 

I And in some localities that there is 
a disregard of the principle of tithing 
as well. Who is forced to pay tith- 
ing? Nobody; the principle upon 
which some of the brethren work with 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



whom I am acquainted is, they say in 
their hearts, and they have said it to 
me: "I want to bind the Lord. He 
has promised; I want to fulfill my part 
of that promise that it may be verified 
to me." They are punctual and they 
strive to discharge that obligation. If 
we do it not, we have no promise, but 
we have a promise if we fulfill it, 
and though we may do it imperfectly 
but with a good and honest heart and 
if we are striving to do our duty in 
this respect, God ds bound to fulfill His 
part. He always does it, as was testi- 
fied of here by the brethren who have 
spoken this morning. God always ful ■ 
fills His pant. Now, brethren, try it. 
If you come here and listen to the 
words of inspiration from our Presi- 
dency, from our brethren, the leading 
men, they fall upon, stony ground if 
you do not heed them. You must not 
do this. Go from here with the deter- 
mination that with the help of God you 
will fulfill yoiur obligations. 

There is another thing that I find a 
great evil among some of the people, 
and that is moral cowardice. A brother 
offends, and they have not the moral 
courage to go to him and say: "You 
have offended me; let us 1 make it right, 
brother, so that we can live in harmo- 
ny." Brethren, and sisters, make up 
your minds to take the Doctrine and 
Covenants and study what God says 
upon this subject; when you go to 
your homes., read it; and with the help 
of God keep enmity and jealousy out 
of your hearts. God has commanded 
it and He demands it at our handsi — 
that we have no such feelings. He de- 
mands it this day, because they are 
evils in our midst. Let me have the 
moral courage, and instead of saying 
as I have heard men. say: "I will get 
even with him," let me go to the man 
if I have got anything to say to him 
and say it in as mild a spirit as I 
can command under the inspiration of 
the Spirit, of God, and say to him: "Let 
us heal these differences." That brings 
peace, that brings love and joy, and the 
love of God will increase in the midst 
of the people. 

"We are too apt to make a man an 
offender for a word. If God was to 
make you and I an offender for a word, 
we never would rise above the existence 



we have here; we never could see any- 
thing better than we have here; but 
He would have you to never sit in 
judgment upon your fellowmen. Let 
God judge, whose right it is to judge. 
Who knows what his providences are? 
If I am injured, or tempted, or should 
have to meet sorrow or sickness or 
death, if I have lived according to the 
light that He has given me, am I not 
safe in every particular? O, yes. God 
will overrule; but don't let me sit in 
judgment upon my fellow man; let 
God judge; and let me say in my 
heart, However constrained my cir- 
cumstances may be, I acknowledge the 
hand of God in everything. 

Now, beware of the leaven of the 
Gentiles, I suppose this is too plain 
talk for this time of year, under the 
circumstances. What do I mean by 
it? I mean by that that you have re- 
ceived a knowledge of the Holy One, 
and the leaven of the Gentiles is to 
leaven that knowledge that you have 
received from God Himself until it is 
entirely obscured. 

Now, there is a great harvest; the 
earth groans with her harvest. Look- 
ing backward need I cite you to the 
past few year's experience that we have 
had, need I say to you that the day 
was when your cattle was worth noth- 
ing? The man that owned the most 
cattle was among the poorest in Zion. 
Today we are beginning to talk of cat- 
tle kings. There was no demand for 
them; no demand for grain today; but 
a little while ago, there was no demand 
for property in Salt Lake and through- 
out the State. Bye and bye, men were 
aroused and went in a sense crazy. 
These men are not all dead, and they 
are liable to go crazy again. Plenty 
will follow a dearth, and dearth will 
follow plenty. We are thriving i'n every 
particular, in every manner, in wealth, 
material wealth that is useful, that 
builds us up, that feeds and clothes us, 
that gives us homes and habitations, 
beautiful orchards, gardens, farms- 
all that we desire. We are wonderfully 
blessed in material wealth here. 
Brethren do you not suppose that there 
will come a time when these, all these 
things will be changed? Why I know 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



5] 



that such action will come. I do not 
know when, but mark it, whenever 
there Is a flush, ^t seems to me that the 
opposite follows. It is so in the rains 
that fall upon the earth; when we have 
deep snows in the mountains and 
plenty of water here, in a little time 
this plentiful supply is followed by a 
drougth. It seems to me that it comes 
in streaks. 

Well, now, this is so in our lives. 
God will temper these things to the 
good of His people. When the earth 
yields in abundance is the time to take 
care of it. When you have plenty of 
grain, plenty of wealth and the abund- 
ance of the earth is given to you, I 
say to you» go from this Conference and 
take care of it. Brother George God- 
dard said yesterday a thing that was 
written upon my mind and has been 
ever since I saw the fields north and 
South: Seeing the enormous quantity 
of the products of the earth, I felt in 
my heart that a scarcity may follow 
this plenty. I do pray that the Saints, 
above all men, will take care of the 
bounties that the Lord has given them. 

There is a great deal that comes to 
my mind in relation to this matter, 
but I haven't time to talk about it, and 
I do not think it would be profitable 
to do it here, but I can touch upon the 
points that I had in my mind and that 
come to me standing here, for the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to be mindful of. 

One of the great things for us to do 
is to be mindful of our children, our 
sons and daughters. Now some of you 
who live in the country permit your 
daughters to come to this city to get 
work. They come here to work for a 
livelihood, to get themselves clothing 
and to help their families, and for 
other reasons. Our girls want to ap- 
pear as well as anybody. They are 
certainly as good looking as any other 
class of young ladies I have met in my 
travels on the earth, and they want to 
show their good looks and be a little 
fashionable. We cannot help that; I 
do not know that they can. But there 
is a great difference between this and 
permitting them to be surrounded by 
circumstances through which they 
might be led astray. If it is necessary 



for them to go out to work, try to see 
that they get a situation where they 
at least will be respected, and return 
to you as they left you, with their vir- 
tue not destroyed, but willing to come 
into the family circle, and the family 
circle willing to receive them. 

I rejoice with you. God bless you, 
and let us one and all go from this Con- 
ference .with the determination that we 
will live as God would have us live, 
that we may attain unto the great 
blessing of eternal life. 

May God be with us in our homes 
and in our habitations throughout the 
length and breadth of the land, and 
strengthen us in the cause of truth, for 
I believe in my heart that the Latter- 
day Saints are the only people that are 
striving intelligently to be saved in 
the celestial kingdom of our God. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON 
said: 

This is a very solemn occasion, 
and the spectacle from the stand is 
most impressive. It is difficult to re- 
press emotion on seeling such an as- 
sembly. "We have come together this 
afternoon in solemn assembly, to vote 
for the authorities of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Every one present is entitled to vote — 
to vote as he pleases — that is, every 
member of the Church. They can 
either vote for or against. Every one 
has perfect liberty. And it is well 
that you should understand the method 
of voting. The brethren will be called 
upon in their various quorum capa- 
cities to vote. If their vote is an af- 
firmative vote, they will rise from their 
seats and raise their right hands. 
When they have thus voted, if there 
are any negative votes— they having 
kept their seats — they can rise and 
vote. And each one as I have said, 
will have perfect liberty to vote as he 
pleases. 

The order of voting by quorums was 
as follows: 

First — The Twelve Apostles. 

Second— The Patriarchs, Presidents 
of Slakes and their counselors, and the 
High Councilors. 

Third— High Priests. 

Fourth — Seventies. 

Fifth— Elders. 

Sixth— Bishops and their counselors. 

Seventh — Priests, Teachers and 
Deacons. 

Eighth— The entire congregation. 

In each instance President Cannon 
announced the vote to sustain the au- 
thorities successively, then said to the 
voting quorum: Are you prepared to 
vote upon this question? If so, arise 
to your feet and raise your right hands. 
"When the arffimativc vote was cast he 



called for those opposed, to arise to 
their feet. 

Lorenzo Snow, as Prophet, Seer and 
Revelatcr, and President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints in all the world. 

George Q. Cannon as First Counselor 
in the First Presidency. 

Joseph F. Smith as Second Counselor 
in the First Presidency. 

Franklin D. Richards as President of 
the Twelve Apostles. 

As members of the que rum of the 
Twelve Apcstles — Franklin D. Rich- 
ards, Erigham Young, Francis M. Ly- 
man, John Henry Smith, George Teas- 
dale, Heber J. Grant, John W. Taylor, 
Marriner W. Merrill, Arlthon H. Lund, 
Matthias F. Cowley and Abraham 0. 
"Woodruff. 

All the voting was unanimous, and 
it was so announced, until the nega- 
tive vote upon sustaining the members 
of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles 
was called from the Elders. Two of 
these arose to their feet. President 
Cannon addressing them, asked who 
they objected to and for what reason? 

Each of these two Elders said he ob- 
jected to John "W. Taylor, and the rea- 
son was certain objectionable remarks 
made by him in Conference on Friday, 
October 7th. 

They were asked if they would come 
to the stand at the close of the session 
and see whether Brother Taylor could 
make the matter right with and satis- 
fy them. Both replied that they were 
willing to do this. 

The voting for members of the quo- 
rum of the Twelve Apostles then went 
forward uninterrupted and was unani- 
mous, until the negative vote of the 
entire Congregation was called for. At 
this point a number of members of the 
Tabernacle choir, probably from twenty 
to twenty-five of both sexes, arose to 
their feet. 

On being asked by President Can- 
non who they objected to and the rea- 
son for it, they replied that they object- 
ed to John W. Taylor on account of 
some disparaging remarks he had made 
in Conference regarding the choir, on 
Friday, October 7th. They were asked 
if they were willing that Brother Tay- 
lor should personally meet with the 
choir and endeavor to make the mat-

ter right to their satisfaction. They 
signified that this arrangement was 
agreeable to them. 

It was then announced by President 
Cannon that a vacancy had been cre- 
ated in the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles by the removal of President 
Snow from it to assume the position 
of President of the Church. It had 
been decided that this vacancy should 
be filled, and announced the name of 
Rudger Clawson for the position. The 
mind and word of the Lord had been 
obtained upon the selection of Brother 
Clawson for this office. 

A motion was made and put to the 
several quorums and to the entire con- 
gregation, -that Rudger Clawson be 
ordained an Apostle, be one of the 
Twelve Apostles and a member of that 
council. The voting was unanimously 
affirmative. 

The following authorities were then 
presented to the entire congregation 
to be voted upon in the usual way 
which obtains at ordinary General 
Conferences, and were unanimously 
sustained: 

The counselors in the First Presi- 
dency and the Twelve Apostles as 
Prophets, Seers and Revelators. 

Patriarch 'to the Church— John 

Smith. 

First Seven Presidents of -the Seven- 
ties—Seymour B. Young, C. D. Fjeld- 
sted, B. H. Roberts, George Reynolds, 
Jonathan G. Kimball, Rulon S. Wells 
and Joseph W. McMurrin. 

William B. Preston as presiding 
Bishop, with Robert T. Burton as his 
first and John R. Winder as his sec- 
ond counselor. 

Franklin D. Richards as Church 
historian and general Church recorder, 
with John Jaques, Charles W. Pen- 
rose and Andrew Jenso'n as his assist- 
ants. 

As 'the General Church Board of 
Education — Lorenzo Snow, George, Q. 
Cannon, Karl G. Maeser, Willard 
Young, Anihon H. Lund, James Sharp, 
Joseph F. Smith, John Nicholson and 
George H. Brimhall. 

As Trustee-in-Trust for 'the body of 
religious worshippers known as the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints — Lorenzo Snow. 

John Nicholson as olerk of 'the Gen- 
eral Conference.

It Was stated thait the release of the 
presidency of the European mission 
had been contemplated, and that one 
of the number, Elder Edwin F. Parry, 
had already returned. By unanimous 
voite of the Conference Elders Rulon 
S. Wells and Joseiph W. McMurrin 
were 'also released, aind Plate D. Lyman 
appointed bo preside over 'the European 
mission, with James L. McMurrin arid 
Henry W. Naisbitt as his counselors. 

Similar unanimous action was taken 
with regani 'to releasing Brother 
Lautensock from the position of presi- 
dent over the German mission and the 
appointment of Arnold H. Schuithess 
to succeed him. 

President Cannon remarked that 
there was no other Church in the 
world the officers of which were sub- 
jected to such an ordeal as had been 
applied to those who had been voted 
on here today, and he felt 'thankful for 
the unanimity that had prevailed. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

Brethren and sisters, this is a very 
trying position that I occupy before 
you this afternoon. It isi true, as 
President Cannon has said, thait I have 
been placed in some trying situations. 
I was with Elder Joseph Standing at 
the time of his martyrdom, and was 
myself exposed for a few moments to 
martyrdom, but I escaped through the 
providence of the Lord. I have been 
placed behind prison bars for the tes- 
timony of Jesus, and that was a very 
trying situation. When I came out of 
the penitentiary I was told that the 
Lord wanted me to labor as President 
of the Box Elder Stake, and I assure 
you, brethren and sisters, that that 
was a great surprise to me at that 
time, and very trying. I had been 
brought up in Salt Lake City; all my 
interests, all my associations, and, as 
I thought, all my expectations were in 
Salt Lake City, and it was a great 
trial for me to be called away. No 
inducements were offered, but I was 
told that the Lord would bless and sus- 
tain me in that appointment, and I 
testify to you, my brethren and sisters, 
that I have been sustained in my presi- 
dency of the Box Elder Stake of Zion, 
and I have enjoyed my labors there. 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There is a good people in that Stakes — 
a people, I believe, 'who are trying to 
serve the Lord. They have sustained 
me and I have felt blessed and pros- 
pered in my labors there. This later 
call that has come has proven to be a 
very great surprise. I had no> knowl- 
edge of it; I had no notice of it what- 
ever, only as it has come to me today 
in this meeting. My patriarchal bless- 
ing, that was given a number of years 
ago, indicated that I would be called 
to a high appointment in the Church in 
the due time of the Lord, and I pre- 
sume that this is the appointment now. 
I feel very weak; 1 feel very humble. 
I know that unless I can enjoy the 
spirit of the apostleship and the faith 
and prayers and the support of my 
brethren and sisters of this Church I 
cannot stand, I cannot succeed in this 
labor; and therefore I earnestly pray 
that God will be with me, and that I 
may have your faith and prayers, and I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

A serious ordeal— A. godlike resolve— The Saints 
increasing In strength— Will have greater power 
in the future— glory and dominion in eternity. 

My brethren and sisters, this to me is, 
as it undoubtedly is to you, a solemn 
scene. It is wonderful what the Elders 
of Israel have succeeded in securing; 
it is perfectly marvelous the union of 
feeling and of action, found nowhere 
else in the world, among such a great 
number of people as are here this af- 
ternoon. I never felt more humble 
than I do on this occasion. It is, as 
was said by President Cannon, a seri- 
ous ordeal through which we have to 
pass from time to time — to be pre- 
sented here before the people, and all 
of our past acts and doings viewed by 
them, and we depend upon their sanc- 
tion and approval or rejection. This 
belongs to them. The Holy Spirit of 
light, that brings intelligence to us 
and an understanding of sacred things, 
belongs to every member of the 
Church. They have a right to pass 
their opinion upon those that are pre- 
siding over them. The works and 
the labors that the officers perform in 



the presence of this people may be 
known and understood by every mem- 
ber of the Church — in a general way, 
at least. There may be some things 
that the First Prsidency do; that the 
Apostles do, that cannot for the mo- 
ment be explained; yet the spirit, the 
motives that inspire the action can be 
understood, because each member of 
the Church has a right to have that 
measure of the Spirit of God that they 
can judge as to those who are acting 
in their interests or otherwise. 

Now, brethren, this much I say, and 
I say it in the name of the Lord: I 
will endeavor to be devoted to your 
interests and the interests of the king- 
dom of God. I will serve you to the 
best of my knowledge and understand- 
ing, in reference to that which will 
promote your interests in connection 
with the interests of the Almighty. I 
will do this, the Lord being my helper. 

It is an easy thing for us to rise here 
and raise our right hands in token of 
our approval of what is presented be- 
fore us. I can do that without any 
trouble, and so can you. But there 
is something involved in this rising 
here and raising our right hands in ap- 
proval of the propositions presented; 
there is a meaning to it; something 
that ought to be well considered, and 
that is, acting in the future in accord- 
ance with this manifestation of our 
approval. Now, I know — and I know 
it well; no-body can know it better- 
that if this mighty Priesthood and 
these Latter-day Saints that are before 
me will act up to that which they 
have approved by raising their right 
hands and in accordance with the mo- 
tives that undoubtedly inspired them, 
the progress of this Church will be 
more rapid than it has been in the 
past. The Latter-day Saints are be- 
coming stronger. They are much 
stronger at this Conference than they 
were at the last, as a general thing. 
There are some, no doubt, that are 
weaker, that have not the strength 
and the faith they had six months ago; 
but the people, speaking generally, 
are much stronger and, if called upon, 
could endure more and make higher 
sacrifices than they could have done 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 



55 



six months ago. There is a satisfac- 
tion in this consideration. 

In this solemn assembly, let us decree 
in our hearts, let us inwardly testify 
to the Dord, that we will be a better 
people, a more united people at our 
next Conference than we are today. 
This should be the feeling- and deter- 
mination of every man and woman 
present in this solemn assembly. T 
feel in my heart that I will try to be 
more devoted than I have been in the 
past to the interests of the kingdom 
of God and the carrying- out of His 
purposes. We are bound to rise and 
to advance in power and in influence 
in the midst of the world. There may, 
as has been suggested by one of the 
speakers, be opposition to meet of a 
nature that we have never met before; 
such things have come in the past, and 
will come in the future; but I will as- 
sure you that if we will do our duty 
with a determination that we will be 
prepared for everything; we will go 
through successfully any future diffi- 
culties that may arise no matter how 
serious they may be. "We have done 
wonders; we have passed through dif- 
ficulties and made sacrifices that are 
marvelous, when we consider their na- 
ture. And we have done, and will do 
in the future, that which we never 
could have done unless we had edu- 
cated ourselves by the spirit and power 
of God. We are a mighty people, and 
growing mightier as trials and diffi- 
culties arise. I can imagine that at 
some future period, in the other life, 
we will pass through an ordeal that 
will be as close and as serious to us as 
we have passed through today; for 
our past course and conduct will be 
fully understood. What a pleasure 
and consolation we have in thinking 
of the past, the sacrifices we "have 
made, the purity of our motives, and 
the feelings that have exercised us in 
the past in having done right and 
passed through ordeals that were of 
an unpleasant nature. Coming before 
this mighty people here, what a pleas- 
ure there is in thinking that we have 
done heretofore about as well as we 
knew how, having kept our consciences 
tolerably clear. You who are seated 



here will have opportunities of stand- 
ing in the presence of multitudes, and I 
can easily imagine, yonder in the next 
life, after we have passed along per- 
haps a thousand years or more, that 
many of you who are here today will 
have an audience before you of your 
own posterity. I am as sure of it as I am 
that I am talking to you; I know it 
just as well as I know anything. Now 
we are starting in. Most of us, no 
doubt ,have sons and daughters who 
will continue faithful to your counsels, 
and in the other life they will be with 
you and increase with you. It was 
said to Abraham on one occasion that 
his posterity should be as numerous as 
the sands upon the sea shore and as the 
stars in the firmament. His offspring- 
are being increased generation after 
generation. 

It is well for us, once in a while to 
look away ahead and see what will be 
the result of all the sacrifices and labors 
that we endure and perform in this 
life. This existence is but a moment; 
but the other life is continuous from 
eternity to eternity. This is Sunday, 
and we are not pleased to talk very 
much on Sunday, or any other day, on 
matters of politics; but I sometimes 
think that our friends here make them- 
selves a great deal of trouble and there 
are no fruits to their labors and ex- 
ertions. No matter what condition we 
are in, we ought to have that under- 
standing that we can do all our labors 
whatever they may be, as the Lord 
pleases that we should do them. We 
should perform them right and be faith- 
ful in every calling and position that 
we occupy. Whatever may be the dif- 
ficulties or the temptations that a per- 
son may labor under, he should so 
govern and control himself that in 
every condition he may act wisely and 
in a way that will increase his in- 
telligence, power and faith. It is a 
grand position that we occupy. Our 
future is glorious. We could not de- 
sire more for our happiness than 
has been prepared for us. Those who 
endure unto the end shall sit upon 
thrones, as Jesus hath overcome and 
sat down upon His Father's throne. 
All things shall be given unto such 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



men and women, so we are told in the 
revelations we have received. In view 
of these pnospcts, what should we not 
be willing- to sacrifice when duty re- 
quires? It is a great thing, we say, 
for a man to be an Apostle; yet there 
are things you can look forward to 
which are greater than this. A man 
has no reason to envy his friend be- 
cause he happens to get a little higher 
than himself. The glory that is before, 
us is open to every man and every wo- 
man, through this Gospel, which is the 
power of God unto salvation, glory and 
exaltation, in the fulness thereof. We 
have learned some things that are 
more valuable to us than a gold mine 
of the highest richness could possibly 
be. We are the offspring of God, He 
is our Father, and we have a mother 
in the other life as well. These wo- 
men that are sealed to us for time and 
eternity will, with our children be ours 
in the other life, going on in honor and 
gl'ory. The Lord has revealed this to 
us, and we know it is so. Is it not 
something grand to know these things? 
So I say, we should be a holy people, 
a sanctified people, a people that God 
loves, and worthy of being directed 
in the highest path of glory and exal- 
tation. 

It ias been a grand assembly this 
afternoon. We do not gee it every 
day in our lives. How soon such a 
gathering as this, for such a purpose 
will be again, God only knows, unless 
He has revealed it to someone, and I 
doubt whether He has. 

Now, brethren and sisters, God bless 



you. I say it from my heart, and I 
feel it— God bless you. I feel that it 
belongs to me, and my brethren here, 
to be longsuffering, kind, always ready 
to forgive, and to cherish the highest 
love for every man and woman who is 
trying to do the will of God. Do not 
be discouraged, brethren. If you can- 
not become perfect at once; if you see 
that you have weaknesses which have 
brought you into some trouble, do not 
be discouraged; but repent of that 
which you have done wrong, by which 
you have lost more or less of the Spirit 
of God, tell the Lord what you have 
done, and resolve in your hearts that 
you will do it no more. Then the 
Spirit of the Lord will be upon you. I 
say again, my brethren and sisters, 
God bless you, to the full extent of that 
word, and fill you with His Holy Spirit; 
and may we all so live that, when we 
go forth from this life into the next, 
we may have such glorious scenes as 
we have here this afternoon. Amen. 

Mrs. Emily E. Woodward of Boston, 
with much sweetness, sang a solo, 
Come Unto Him All Ye That Labor. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet. 

Benediction by President Joseph F. 
Smith. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

The stenographic work in taking an 
account of the proceedings was done by 
Arthur Winter and E. H. Hol't.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION 



Its Annual General Conference. 



The general semi-annual conference 
of the Sunday schools of the Latter-day 
Saints was held at the Tabernacle, 
Sunday evening', October 9th, 1898, at 7 
o'clock. There were present, of the 
general superintendency, George Q. 
Cannon, George Goddard and Karl G. 
Maeser; all of the members of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union Board, 
and aids, several of the Apostles, the 
Presiding Bishopric, and many Stake 
superintendents, ward officers and Sun- 
day school workers. 

The conference opened with the sing- 
ing of "America" by Professor Evan 
Stephens' juvenile class, numbering 
about 300 children. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Andrew 
Kimball. The juveniles then sang 
"We Ever Pray for Thee." General Sec- 
retary Geo. D. Pyper then called the 
roll, which was responded to by twen- 
ty-nine Stakes. 

Elder Heber J. Grant presented the 
general Sunday school authorities, and 
they were sustained as follows: 

George Q. Cannon, general superin- 
tendent; George Goddard, first assist- 
ant general superintendent; Karl G. 
Maeser, second assistant general super- 
intendent; Geo. D. Pyper, general sec- 
retary; George Reynolds, general treas- 
urer; Leo Hunsaker, stenographer. 

As members of the ,Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board: George Q. Can- 
non, George Goddard, Karl G. Maeser, 
George Reynolds, Thomas C. Griggs, 
Joseph W. Summerhays, Levi W. 
Richards, Francis M. Lyman, Heber J. 
Grant, Joseph M. Tanner, George Teas- 
dale, Hugh J. Cannon, Andrew Kim- 
ball, and Joseph F. Smith. 

As aids to the board: L. John Nut- 
tall, James W. Ure, John F. Bennett, 
John M. Mills, W. B. Dougall, W. D. 



Owen, Seymour B. Young and C. D. 
Fjeldsted. 

First Assistant General Superintend- 
ent George Goddard said: 

"I feel truly grateful to my Heavenly 
Father for the privilege of meeting so 
many of you here in the interest of our 
Sunday schools. And, as I notice so 
many in the congregation before me 
and so many of the juveniles behind 
me, it would be a gratification to my- 
self and the other authorities of our 
schools, if all the Sunday school chil- 
Iren and all the teachers and officers 
)f our Sunday schools that are here 
tonight will please rise to their feet, 
that we may see how much of a con- 
gregation of Sunday school workers 
we have got. (Almost the entire con- 
gregation arose.) 

"Forty-nine years ago there was not 
me Sunday school amongst the Latter- 
day Saints; today, we have over a 
thousand. We have over 12,000 teach- 
ers in our Sunday schools, and over 
100,000 Sunday school children— the 
largest numerically of any organization 
in the Church. We have forty organ- 
ized Stakes of Zion. Out of these 
forty Stakes, twenty-seven Sunday 
school conferences have been held, and 
some members of our Union Board 
have been present at each, since our 
last April conference. The labor now 
devolving upon the Sunday School 
Union Board is very great. We have 
correspondence all over the world. We 
meet every Thursday, hold about, on 
an average, a two hours' meeting, and 
that scarcely gives us time to get 
through the business that is required. 
The needs of all these schools are of 
that character that the Nickel Fund 
is not sufficient to meet the require- 



58 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



inents of the growing conditions of our 
/outh. Think of the mighty army! 
We have got between twelve and fif- 
teen thousand Sunday school officers 
and teachers devoting their time to 
the work without any compensation. I 
say God bless tb- Sunday school 
workers for the love they take in train- 
ing the youth of zjion to become citi- 
zens fit for any part of the civilized 
world. 

I was requested to close my remarks 
by singing a song, and a soner that had 
a good chorus to it. Six months ago, 
at our last April Conference, while 
sitting on this stand here, a young lady 
came up and asked me to rise on my 
feet, and she placed on my left breast 
a gold medal, the head line of which 
simply reads, "Who's on the Lord's 
Side?" That fact reminded me that I 
could not make-a better selection than 
to sing that very same song. 

Elder Goddard sang, "Who's on the 
Lord's Side?" At the end of the second 
verse he asked every one who would 
like to be on the Lord's side when the 
Savior ccmes to rise to their feet as an 
expression of that desire, while he 
should sing the last verse. (The full 
congregation arose and joined in the 
chorus.) 

Treasurer George Reynolds said he 
simply desired to make two or three 
business announcements. The first was 
that at our last conference the general 
board promised that they would issue 
during the present year forty leaflets: 
but finding that if they issued forty 
only they would have to leave off the 
iesisons at a point that was undesirable, 
they had decided to- is.sue eight, more: 
so that forty-eight leaflets will be is- 
sued this year, concluding with the 
Book of Mormon lessons at the end of 
the monarchy and the establishment 
of the republic amongst the Nephites. 
But the board found in their visits that 
nearly all the schools are behind; in 
fact, it could not be otherwise with 
those who, with care, teach the leaflets, 
for very few of the leaflets can be con- 
sidered, digested and understood in one 
Sabbath morning. It would take three 
mornings with many of those lessons to 
understand them properly. Therefere, 
the board had decided to cease the pub- 



lication of the leaflets for a few months, 
to enable the schools to , catch up, and 
also for those who want to go over the 
lessons the second time to perfect 
themselves therein, that they may have 
the opportunity of so doing. So the 
leaflets will be published to the end of 
the present year and then the Union 
board will cease for a short time to is- 
sue any more. He invited the Stake 
superintendents and ward superintend- 
ents and other officers interested, to 
call at the office of the Deseret Sunday 
School Union in the Templeton build- 
ing, rooms 408 and 409, to examine some 
object lesson charts, published by Ban- 
croft Bros. & Co., San Francisco— les- 
sons which they claimed were highly 
valuable in the Sunday school cau-se. 
They were more particularly intended 
to illustrate passages of Scripture 
wherein natural objects were spoken of, 
such as the different seeds, herbs, min- 
erals, money and measures, and the 
different kinds of wood, etc. 

Elder Reynolds also announced that 
the annual Sunday school conference 
of Uintah Stake would he held on the 
last Saturday and Sunday of this 
month, the 29th and 30th of October, 
and that of the Emery Stake on the 5th 
and 6th of November. Other Stake 
Sunday school conferences would be 
announced later. 

Elder Heber J. Grant read t 
letter signed by the general 
superintendency on the subject of the 
nickel fund. Continuing he said: 

"We wish it understood distinctly 
that on this nickel Sunday we desire a 
nickel from every man, woman and 
child connected with the Sunday school. 
And if any one wants to pay 'a dollar, 
five dollars, ten, or even fifty or a 
hundred dollars, we won't say no. We 
are perfectly willing to have you put a 
hundred dollar bill in the nickel en- 
velope, if you feel like doing so. Every 
dollar that has ever been paid in on 
this nickel Sunday has been used for 
the salvation of our children. As has 
been stated here by Brother Goddard, 
the board meets regularly eVery week 
and considers matters connected with 
the interests of the Sunday schools; 
they devote their time and talents for 
the benefit of the Sunday school cause, 
and have done it without remuneration.

They have traveled hundreds and thou- 
sands of miles in the interest of the 
Sunday schools. And it needs this 
small contribution to furnish them with 
the sinews of war, so to speak. We 
trust that every Sunday school super- 
intendent will see that there is a sum 
equal at least to the total number of 
officers, teachers and pupils in the 
school, reckoning at five cents eachjand 
we would be pleased if you sent more, 
because a proper use will be made of 
all the funds placed in our hands." 

"It is the desire of our general super- 
intendent, George Q. Cannon, that the 
Sunday schools should not have nickel 
Sundays for local purposes. "We have 
found that the system of nickel day 
every Sunday in the year, or at least 
once a month, has grown up on ac- 
count of this nickel fund of the Sun- 
day School Union. The nickel Sunday 
has become popular, and a great ma- 
jority of the superintendents and offi- 
cers of Sunday schools have seen how 
well the nickel Sunday has worked and 
have inaugurated this system for the 
benefit of their local Sunday schools. 
It has been and is the desire and ex- 
pressed wish of our general superinten- 
dent that this be done away with and 
that we have the nickel Sunday only 
for the benefit of the Sunday School 
Union Board, and also for the benefit of 
the Stake Sunday schools, who receive 
one-fifth of the amount collected. We 
trust that you and every one will make 
this an individual matter and be more 
earnest and ardent workers, and there 
will be no difficulty in collecting these 
funds." 

Elder Horace S. Ensign then sang 
the sacred solo, "Jerusalem," and his 
magnificent baritone voice charmed the 
large and appreciative audience. 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon said: 

"I have been informed that there is 
an indifference, a growing indifference, 
noticeable in different places in rela- 
tion to Sunday schools, and that there 
is not that interest apparent that has 
been and that should be. Of course, 
every movement of this kind must be 
sustained by energy and by those who 
are engaged in the movement taking 
an interest in it and giving it their at- 
tention and bestowing thought and la- 
bor upon it. Various suggestions have. 



been made as to how this shall be 
remedied and what steps should be 
taken to infuse, shall I say new life, 
to infuse life a little more than we 
have 'at present, into every department 
of our Sunday schools. I need not 
dwell before this audience upon the im- 
portance of Sunday school work. It Pies, 
it may be said, at the foundation of 
every association we have among us. 
The children that go to Sunday school 
soon become young men, and join the 
Mutual Improvement associations; and 
the girls grow to be young ladies and 
they have their functions to attend to, 
and they are more efficient in the path 
of success if they are trained in the 
Sunday school as they should be. 

"Now, I have in my hand some mem- 
oranda regarding Sunday school work, 
and the holding of a convention for 
Sunday school workers. My proposi- 
tion is that we should hold a Sunday 
school convention during the latter 
part of November or the beginning of 
December next; that we should have 
this not too near the Christmas holi- 
days; that it last two days, Mon- 
day and Tuesday; that three meetings 
be held each day; that the Stake dele- 
gates be guests of the Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board apportioned among 
the Sunday schools of this city while 
they stay here; that badges shall be 
prepared for the visitors, for we want 
our brethren and sisters to come and 
visit us and take part in this conven- 
tion; that President Angus M. Cannon 
and his counselors, the presidency of 
this Stake, be asked to give the pre- 
ceding Sunday evening to the Deseret 
Sunday School Union, and that the 
board divide the visitors among th° 
various wards to speak on Sunday 
school matters and help vivify the 
Sunday schools of the city. I trust 
that the presidency of this Stake will 
see their way clear to permit this and 
that it will not interfere with anything 
they may have in mind. The speakers 
chosen should be notified as soon as 
possible, to give them time to prepare, 
so that in the event of any being un- 
able to attend, the opportunity may be 
given to the board to select others. 
That is, if some are selected to prepare 
for this and tbey cannot fulfill the 
expectation or requirement, the board

shall receive notice in time that others 
may be selected for the purpose; and a 
committee of three should be chosen 
from the members of the board to ar- 
range the details of the convention and 
take charge of the preparatory work. 
Now these are points that I have writ- 
ten, so that you might get a clear idea 
of the object of the move. Here is a 
suggestive program £or the Sunday 
school convention: 

"Monday morning, address of wel- 
come; the objects of the convention; 
the Sunday school treatise; Sunday 
school teacher's meeting; how to reach 
delinquent scholars. 

"Monday afternoon, subjects: How to 
best maintain order in the school; how 
to use the Leaflets; the use of the 
Mickel Fund: home reading in connec- 
tion with the Sunday school. 

"Monday evening, how to grade the 
Sunday school; the relationship of the 
Church to the Sunday school; the Sun- 
day school as an auxiliary to the 
home; the home as an auxilary to the 
Sunday school. 

"Tuesday morning. Kindergarten and 
infant classes in the Sunday school; 
punctuality — how best secured; the 
Sunday school superintendent; the 
Sunday school teacher. 

On Tuesday afternoon, Sunday school 
choirs and their relationship to con- 
gregational singing; lesson on the pre- 
sentation of the authorities; how to 
conduct Stake Sunday school confer- 
ences; the program for 1899 Stake con- 
ferences. 

"Tuesday evening, how best to pre- 
pare a Sunday school lesson; the Bible 
in the Sunday school; the Book of 
Mormon in the Sunday school; the ad- 
ministration of the Sacrament in the 
schools. Each meeting to be opened 
by a half hour's singing practice of 
such songs as will be recommended to 
be sung at the 1899 Sunday school con- 
ferences, and such to be closed by re- 
marks from the general superintendent, 
and his assistants, as we may wish. 

"Now these subjects we would like to 
have treated upon. If the committee 
can sec- where some improvements 
can be made in this, of course I shall 
be in favor of their having latitude to 



change or to suggest additional sub- 
jects." 

Elder Seymour B. Young moved that 
the suggestions be adopted by this 
meeting. Carried. General Superin- 
tendent George Q. Cannon then ap- 
pointed Elders George Reynolds, 
Joseph W. Summerhays and George D. 
Pyper as the committee to arrange the 
details of the convention and take 
charge of the preparatory work. 

Continuing General Superintendent 
Cannon said: "I would like you to 
take hold of this energetically and let 
us have something that will be credit- 
able and interesting, that all who attend 
may go away instructed and infused 
with rife and with a determination to 
lift the Sunday school and make it 
what it should be. This committee can 
take the necessary steps to invite such 
persons or brethren and sisters from 
afar as they may deem proper; but it 
is a general invitation and we would 
like you all to come, and we will do the 
best that can be done to entertain you, 
and give you a chance to teach us in our 
wards. Give us your ideas and tell us 
what you do, so that we may get a mu- 
tual benefit in mingling together in that 
manner. 

"I may say that Brother Heber J. 
Grant's remarks about the nickel fund 
are in strict accord with my feelings. I 
do not want our Sunday schools to be- 
come begging institutions, or to become 
burdensome to our children. Do not 
make the poor children who cannot 
give the nickel feel badly. Avoid that, 
because the feelings of children are 
very delicate. "We should not do any- 
thing that would make them feel that 
they are inferior in any way to any- 
body else. I hope that what has been 
said will be remembered by all the 
teachers and superintendents." 

Second Assistant Karl G. Maeser said: 
"Members of the Sunday School 
Union board have occasionally visited 
annual Sunday school conferences 
when they have felt disappointed in 
some measure in not getting that kind 
of information regarding the condition 
of the Sunday schools, which they de- 
sired, and I ^ave been requested, there- 
fore, to speak in regard to the way and 
manner in which the Sunday school

conferences should be conducted. Now, 
the nature and object of an annual 
Sunday school Stake conference is three 
fold. The first object is to present to 
all the Sunday schools in that stake 
pattern and model exercises. Upon this 
subject I need not speak now. I refer 
to the instructions that were 
given upon this point at the 
last April Conference, when we 
met here. The second point or object 
of our annual Sunday school Stake 
conference is to give the visiting 1 mem- 
bers of the Sunday School Union Board 
am opportunity to obtain as much in- 
formation in regard to the condition of 
the Sunday schools in the Stake as time 
and circumstances will permit. That 
can be obtained in two ways: These 
visiting members of the Sunday School 
Union Board witness the class exer- 
cises, according to the instructions 
given upon that subject at the last 
April Conference. These are the best 
class exercises upon the various sub- 
jects that have been selected by the 
Stake superintendeney— the best class 
exercises that can be found in the 
Stake. That gives the visiting breth- 
ren the opportunity of seeing the con- 
dition, or judging of the condition of 
the Sunday schools. Eight class exer- 
cises of the best kind should be given, 
two on Saturday morning and after- 
noon; two Sunday morning; two on 
Sunday afternoon. Then there is al- 
ways something from a primary, first 
intermediate, second intermediate, and 
theological, class, and concert recita- 
tions of some kind; the next point at 
which we can get our information 
about the conditions of the Sunday 
schools comes from the reports of the 
superintendents of the different 
schools.. The Sunday School Union 
Board have drawn up twenty-one 
points upon which they would like to 
have answers given. A copy of this 
will be sent to every Sunday school 
superintendent throughout Zion. Each 
superintendent should prepare himself 
for this and not come up and talk a 
'goody goody' talk for five or six 
minutes or more and then sit down 
without saying anything about his 
Sunday school. This is the second 
point that gives us necessary informa- 
tion in regard to the condition of the 



Sunday school. The third point is to 
give the visiting members of the Sun- 
day School Union Board an opportunity 
to give instructions. These instruc- 
tions are based upon the answers 
which the superintendents give in re- 
porting their Sunday schools. The Sun^- 
d'ay School Union members will note 
conditions and the different points, 
based upon the observations which 
.hey have found and made during the 
class exercises, which is the second 
point upon which we can base our 
instructions. The third is the ques- 
tions which should be handed in by 
Sunday school officers and teachers, 
questions which have arisen on 
Sunday school work and the principles 
of the Gospel, which are expected to be 
taught in the Sunday schools. Suppose, 
now, we get six of these questions in- 
every one of these meetings, then we 
have twenty-four questions handed in 
during the conference, twenty-four im- 
portant Sunday school points under 
consideration. And if there is any 
point that we may not have the author- 
ity or capacity to answer, we will take 
it home and report it to the Sunday 
School Union Board, where it will be 
disposed of; and if the board has not 
the authority to answer it, our general 
superintendent, George Q. Cannon, is a 
member of the First Presidency, and 
there we can get it from the fountain- 
head, and you get your answer in due 
time. 

"And then the next point that I would 
like to have called your attention is, 
that it is not our mission to talk mere- 
ly to the comparatively few Sunday 
school workers that are attending our 
annual Sunday school Stake confer- 
ences. It is not very likely that we 
shall have all the officers and teachers 
of the whole Stake present, but we want 
to reach them all. We are not coming 
merely to make some talk, to say some 
nice things, etc., and then go home 
again. When we come it is for the pur- 
pose of putting questions, so to speak, 
alongside the Sunday school work, how 
it should be conducted, so that when 
we come around again another year, all 
these points will have been carried out, 
at least as nearly as possible, and then 
new questions can be put, becausp the 
Sunday school work is advancing and 



62

progressing. Think of what it was 
twenty or thirty years ago and com- 
pare it with today! There is no stand- 
ing still, we are going onward continu- 
ally. Now it is impossible for every one 
of us to remember all the points that 
have been brought up during a confer- 
ence. The board, therefore, desires that 
all the officers and teachers should come 
prepared with paper and pencil and let 
us see you caking notes, as we. see now 
in this and in every semi-annual con- 
ference, and then the following Sunday 
throughout the whole Stake there 
should be a special teachers' meeting 
held, for the benefit of those that have 
not had the privilege of attending the 
Stake conference. And these points 
that have been made during the confer- 
ence should be brought before that 
teachers' meeting and explained there 
while they are still fresh upon the 
minds of those who were present; 
but if j-ou wait three or four weeks 
before you do so, you forget your notes 
and the instructions will measurably 
fade from your minds. Therefore, 
care should be taken that superintend- 
ents remind the officers and teachers 
before the conference comes off, that 
they ma.-" come prepared, so that those 
who are present may take down all 
the important points, and afterwards 
bring them to the knowledge of all 
their fellow laborers throughout the 
Stake, and thus the work of the Sun- 
day schools may go on for another 
year, better and better, always on- 
ward and nearer to God our Eternal 
Father, and benefitting the youth 
whom God has placed into our keep- 
ing." 

Prof. Bassett's juvenile class then 
beautifully sang "In May." 

Elder Joseph W. Summerhays said: 
When the year 1899 shall have passed, 
fifty years will have elapsed since the 
first Sunday school was organized in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints; and it has been proposed 
that we commemorate the event by 
holding a jubilee throughout the 
Church. It was intended that some 
final instructions would be given at 
this conference, but as the fifty years 
do not end until the second Sunday in 



December, there is plenty of time. 
The committee will make their final re- 
port at the next April conference, ft, 
the meantime, however, Sunday 
school superintendents throughout the 
Church are requested to forward to 
the general secretary, George D. 
Pyper, at an early date, the history of 
their organizations which will be en- 
tered up in suitable form for some 
future day. A history of every Sun- 
day school and of every Stake organi. 
zation is desired. 

Elder Joseph M. Tanner said: it 
very frequently happens that buildings 
are not sufficiently warm and the little 
Sunday school children suffer from 
cold and sometimes contract diseases. 
He had had sufficient opportunity to 
observe this imperfect condition in pro- 
viding for the convenience and comfort 
of our children. If the janitor is ever 
in doubt as to the necessity of warm- 
ing the rooms, that doubt should be re- 
solved in favor of the children and the 
buildings be warmed. He hoped that 
superintendents would give it their at- 
tention, and see that as the cold season 
comes on the buildings are prop- 
erly warmed. In the winter time when 
the cold is severe, there is but little 
trouble, but it is during the fall and 
spring of the yeai when they think 
they can get along without fire, that 
the children suffer most. 

First Assistant Superintendent 
George Goddard said he felt very 
thankful to the many Stake superin- 
tendents. Many of them had very 
hard work to perform, manr miles to 
travel away from their homes almost 
every Sunday in the year, visivlDg 
throughout their entire Stakes. "Goo. 
bless those men and every other hon- 
est, enthusiastic worker in our schools, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen." 

Professor Stephens' juvenile class 
then sang, "Courage Shall Our Watch- 
word Be," so beautifully that it had to 
b e repeated. The class also repeated 
"We Ever Pray for Thee." 

The conference then closed, Eldei 
Seymour B. Young 
benediction. 

GEORGE D. PYPER, 
General Secretary.

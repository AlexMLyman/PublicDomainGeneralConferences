OPENING REMARKS. 

I thank God my Heavenly Father 
that I have again the privilege of 
meeting with the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints in the 
capacity of a Semi-Annual Conference. 
This is our Sixty-eighth Semi-Annual 
Conference. We have passed through 
a great variety of history from the 
organization of the Church until the 
pi-esent day. I trust that while we 
are assembled together during this 
Conference the Spirit of God may be 
with us, and with the Apostles and 
Elders who are called upon to speak 
to us", that we may be edified by the 
principles of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God, and be pre- 
pared for that work which still rests 
upon us to carry out. We have a 
great work upon our hands. It has 
been a labor from the organization of 
the Church until the present time. We 
have the world to preach to. That is 
one of the duties God requires at the 
hands of the Elders of Israel. We are 
held responsible for this work and the 
building up of the kingdom of God ac- 
cording to the best light and knowl- 
edge and revelation which God has 
given unto us. We ought to be thankful 
to the Lord for His mercies unto us. 
I feel as though His hand has beer 
visible in the establishing of His 
Church here in the Rocky Mountains, 
from our first arrival as Pioneers in 
the valleys of the mountains, when 
we found a barren desert, until the

present. The hand of the Lord has 
been with this people and with the 
Elders of Israel, and will continue to 
be. The Lord is in earnest, in fulfill- 
ment of His promises from the crea- 
tion of the world down to this day, 
with regard to His dispensations to 
man. I hope and trust that while we 
dwell in the flesh we all may realize 
and understand this. It is a great 
blessing to receive the Gospel of 
Christ, to receive the Holy Priesthood, 
and to be called to labor in the Priest- 
hood for the salvation of the children 
of men. This labor is upon us and will 
remain upon us until the coming of 
the Son of Man in the clouds of 
heaven, to reward every man accord- 
ing to the deeds done in the body. 

I pray God to bless you and to pour 
out His Spirit upon us all, that while 
we are assembled together in this ca- 
pacity we may have union of heart 
and spirit, and the Spirit of God rest- 
ing upon us, to dictate and direct us 
in our labors. Amen. 

ELDER ANTHON H. LUND. 

Missionary Work Effective.— Good Effect of Con- 
ferences.— Object of the Saints to Build up Zion 

I am pleased to have the privilege 
this morning of meeting with you, my 
brethren and sisters, and of hearing 
our President address us. I am glaa 
that he is with us and able to talk so 
that we can all hear him. This has 
been our Jubilee year— fifty .years 
since we arrived in these mountains, 
and we have all reflected more or 
less upon the history of Zion since 
the people arrived here when this re- 
gion was a wilderness. We have 
made comparisons between today and 
then, and all have, no doubt, felt to 
thank the Lord that He has so richly 
blessed His people, and though 
they have gone through times of trial, 
yet they have seen His overruling 
providences in their behalf. Zion has 
prospered; the people have been 
blessed, both temporally and spirit- 
ually; and while they have tried to 
build up Zion at home, they have not 
forgotten the great duty resting upon 
them of sending men to the different 
nations to preach the Gospel. And 
the Lord has been with them, so that 
they have been able to bring thou- 



sands into the fold of Christ. The 
best of reports are coming to us from 
the different missions, showing that the 
Lord is still with His servants, and 
that their efforts are crowned with 
more success than has attended their 
labors for many years past. This makes 
us rejoice, seeing the work of God 
prospering. 

We have come together this morn- 
ing to attend our Conference. I have 
often thought what a great blessing 
to the Saints are these conferences, 
bringing them together from the 
different parts of Zion, to where they 
can renew their old acquaintances, 
and where they can meet together 
under the spirit and influence of the 
Lord, and listen to instructions given 
them which are calculated for their 
best good. These are times of refresh- 
ing unto the Saints. And this is not 
something which has been evolved out 
of the system that God has revealed; 
but it was at first ordained and ap- 
pointed unto the Saints to come to- 
gether on these occasions. There its 
this difference between the work of 
God and the work of man — the worK 
of God has a perfect Author, what 
He commands is not an experimental 
thing, but is something that was seen 
beforehand. The consequences were 
known before the law was given. By 
studying the word of God as given 
through His prophets, we find that He 
knew as well thousands of years ago 
what was for the best good of His 
people as today, and that when the 
prophets spoke of Zion they saw it, 
understood how it should be built, and 
could foretell the Lord's dealings 
with His people. 

We have come to this country to 
build up a Zion unto our God. I hope 
that we have not forgotten the object 
of our coming. I hope that we can be 
classed among the laborers in Zion. 
The Lord has declared that the labor- 
er in Zion shall work for Zion, and he 
adds, "if they labor for money, they 
shall perish." I believe it is the 
Prophet Nephi who wrote these words. 
He wrote them in a chapter 
that is devoted to our time. After 
having described what should come to 
pass between his day and the present 
period of time, he speaks of the com-

ing forth of the Book of Mormon and 
of Zion. I have often thought how 
strange it is that men cannot see the 
internal evidence which the Book of 
Mormon contains of its truth, when 
they can read passages so plain. 

The idea of building up a Zion was 
not a common idea among the different 
denominations that Joseph Smith was 
acquainted with. Men have thought 
that Mormonism is a system made up 
of other religions. We deny this. We 
hold that it is given of God; that it is 
the same Gospel, the everlasting Gos- 
pel, as given in former days to the 
people, and again restored today. 
When you examine the Gospel as 
restored through the Prophet Joseph, 
you find that it has many character- 
istics which are not found among 
other denominations or religions. 
The idea of gathering was not be- 
lieved in by any of the religious peo- 
ple then; but in the Book of Mormon, 
published before this Church was or- 
ganized, we are plainly told that there 
should be a gathering; that the peo- 
ple should be gathered from the differ- 
ent nations of the earth. 

The Prophet Nephi, in speaking of 
Zion, gives us characteristics that 
should be found in the Zion of the 
latter days. Among them was that 
there should not be priestcraft; and 
he defines priestcraft as preaching for 
gain and for influence among the peo- 
ple. This the Lord forbids. He says 
that the people should work for 
Zion. That should be the object of 
their coming together, the one aim 
and purpose of their lives — to work for 
Zion, and not to make anything else 
the object of their lives. If they make 
money their object, He says they shall 
perish. How often have we seen this 
fulfilled! Those who have forgotten 
why the Lord called them from their 
homes and gathered them here, and 
who have made money their 
sole object, have perished spir- 
itually; they have lost the 
faith which was once so strong in 
their breasts that they were able to 
leave everything that was dear unto 
them and gather here. We want to 
take this lesson to heart. We want to 
be laborers in Zion, and work for the 



cause of Zion, and not for other ob- 
jects—that is, not to make them the 
only objects of our lives. It is not for- 
bidden us to work for money. We 
have to do this, to make our living; 
but the Prophet meant that we must 
not make it the sole aim of our 
lives, to enrich ourselves and gain 
wealth. The love of money is the root 
of all evil, has been said, and said truly. 
Not the money itself ; for rightly used, 
I believe it is a blessing. But I am 
afraid that many are not willing to 
use this blessing aright. We certainly 
should not make it the one thing that 
we seek. We want to place our labors 
where they can do the most good for 
the upbuilding of Zion upon the 
earth. If we seek first the kingdom or 
God and His righteousness, these 
other things, He has promised, shall 
be added. We have found the king- 
dom of God; but we want also His 
righteousness. That means that we 
do right in all things between man 
and man, and that we do not forgec 
to do right towards our Heavenly 
Father, and also towards ourselves. 

The Lord has asked us to do certain 
things. We will find that they are for 
our own good. These commandments 
have been given by a kind Father to 
His children. He has seen our condi- 
tions and our circumstances, and 
what He has ordained has been calcu- 
lated for our greatest benefit. When 
such is the case, we should all feel that 
we want to keep His commandments. 
We want to benefit ourselves. In 
fact, this feeling is so strong with us 
that often we forget what is righteous- 
ness, on. account of our selfishness. 
But if we will work truly for our own 
benefit, then we will keep the laws of 
God, we will seek His righteousness, 
we will try to build up His Zion upon 
the earth, and we will listen to the 
counsels which He gives us through 
His servants. If we do this, the great- 
est amount of happiness will be ours, 
and we will be able to do our share 
towards carrying out God's purposes 
on the earth. 

May God bless His Saints. May His 
kingdom prosper. May His servants 
be blessed in their labors. This is niy 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

The Divine Origin of the Church,— Officers not 
Self-appointed, — Profanity Condemned, — Obedi- 
ence Brings Harmony, — Each May Have a Wit- 
ness of the Truth, — A Prediction Fulfilled,— 
Safety in Counsel. 

I have an evidence of the truth of 
this work. I have a testimony from 
the Lord. I know that this work is 
true. I know that Joseph the Prophet 
was chosen as an instrument in the 
hands of the Lord to establish the 
Gospel in the earth in this dispensa- 
tion. I had evidence of this a great 
.many years ago. It has been over 
forty-four years since I became asso- 
ciated with the Saints in these moun- 
tains, and I have been like the rest 
of you, I have had my trials, my dark 
times, and periods of affliction and 
sorrow. I believe that all Saints have 
their trials, if they are trying to do 
right and serve the Lord. The Spirit 
of the Lord has not always been with 
me. I have been left to myself many 
times. But in these times of trial, 
the testimony that I had from the 
Lord of the truth, of the divinity of 
this work has been a great consola- 
tion to me. I have not lost it yet. 
I hope I may never lose it. I believe 
it is possible for people to lose the 
testimony and evidence they have had 
in regard to this work, and to get into 
the dark, and become dissatisfied, and 
complain and find fault with the 
brethren. I have always looked upon 
it as a very dangerous thing for a 
member of the Church to find fault 
with the servants of God, to criticise 
the actions of the Priesthood, because 
in my experience here with the people 
I have witnessed many, apparently 
good men and good women, turn away 
from the Church through indulging in 
this spirit of fault-finding and criti- 
cising the actions of the Priesthood. 

Now, we must remember that there 
is not a single officer in the Church 
who has selected himself. There 
is not one of the Presidency, nor one 
of the Apostles, that has sought the 
position he occupies today. These 
men have not desired the position, and 
have not asked for it. But the Lord, 
in the dispensations of His providence, 
has placed them in office in the 
Church. And when we complain, and 
find fault, and criticise, we must sure- 
ly know that we are criticising the ac- 



tions of the Lord, because He is the 
one that has brought these things to 
pass and placed these men in their 
positions, for the reason, I suppose, 
that they were the ones He wanted 
to carry on His work. The officers of 
this Church have been called to these 
positions, and we ought to remember 
this. We ought to sustain this work, 
sustain the organization of the Church, 
and sustain the Priesthood. Let all 
other things be a secondary considera- 
tion. The Savior said, "Seek first the 
kingdom of God and His righteous- 
ness." That is the first thing for us 
to do; then other things will be added 
unto us as we may need them. As I 
said before, I know this work is true; 
and if I deny the work of the Lord, 
it will be because I get into the dark 
and lose the spirit of it. We are lia- 
ble to do this. Hence it is not safe 
for a Latter-day Saint to forget his 
prayers, and to forget the Lord. We 
should make it the practice of our 
lives to entreat the Lord in the morn- 
ing, and in the evening, and at mid- 
day, and have within our hearts the 
spirit of prayer. 

I am aware that there are families 
in the Church that neglect their 
prayers. Heads of households neglect 
to call their families around them and 
entreat the Lord for His protecting 
care over them during the day or dur- 
ing the night. Is there anybody un- 
der the sound of my voice that neg- 
lects to do these things? If you do, 
you fail that much in living up to the 
requirements of the Gospel. There 
are in some parts of the Church peo- 
ple who profane the name of Deity. 
Now, they ought to know that this 
is wrong. Yet this spirit of profanity 
is too prevalent in some parts of the 
country. As officers and as members 
of the Church, we ought to rebuke such 
conduct in our brethren, and tell them 
kindly that it is not a proper thing to 
do. It is a bad example. It brings 
the displeasure of the Lord. It drives 
away the Holy Spirit, and we are not 
in a position to have the heavens 
opened to us, and to have our prayers 
reach into the ears of the Lord. If 
there are any Latter-day Saints here 
that indulge in profanity, I want to 
exhort you to cease from this time 
forth, and turn unto the Lord with full 
purpose of heart. 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL

When we are living in the light of 
the Gospel, our feelings will harmonize 
with the Presidency and with the 
Apostles and with the Elders that are 
trying to carry on this work. I say 
our spirits will harmonize with theirs, 
because I want to bear record and 
testimony to you that they are doing 
the very best they can for the people 
and for the advancement of the work 
of God, and the Lord is with them 
and He will bring them off victorious. 
Hence the importance, my brethren 
and sisters, of trying to cultivate the 
spirit of humility, of meekness, and 
of kindness, and attending to the la- 
bors, that pertain to us in the Gospel. 
There is something for everybody to 
do. We have all we can possibly do 
if we live the .religion of Jesus Christ. 
We cannot afford to neglect our duties 
in the Gospel. Life is too short for 
us to think of such a thing. We are 
liable to be called to an account any 
time. Scores of people that were here 
at the last Conference are not here 
now perhaps, because of circum- 
stances and conditions which they 
have passed through. This may be 
the case with some of us who are 
here. We may never come to an- 
other Conference; we may never hear 
the voice of President Woodruff or 
the servants of God again. We do 
not know that we will, unless God has 
revealed it to us. No man knoweth 
the things of tomorrow, unless God 
reveals them to him. We know the 
things of yesterday, if we have not 
forgotten them; but we do not know 
of the things of tomorrow. Hence 
the importance of all Latter-day 
Saints living according to the light 
that has been revealed to them. 

Every man and woman has the right 
to have a testimony of this work. 
We may have the evidence for our- 
selves. The hands of the Elders of 
the Church have been placed upon our 
heads, and it has been said unto us, 
"Receive ye the Holy Ghost," and we 
have a right, if we have sincerely re- 
pented of our sins and turned unto the 
Lord with full purpose of heart, to a 
witness. My conviction is that no 
man need be without a testimony of 
this work, whether he be young or 
old. The Lord is no respecter of per- 
sons, and we may know for ourselves, 
for our private use and good. Not 



that we may have revelation or a 
testimony for somebody else, only for 
ourselves. The heavens have been 
opened, and they are open to the faith- 
ful people of God today. Our prayers 
may be heard and answered, if they 
are right and inspired by the Holy 
Ghost. This is the privilege of the 
Latter-day Saints. The world do not 
have these things, because the Lord 
has not revealed the Gospel to them, 
only as He has done it through His 
ministering servants. He has organ- 
ized His Church in the earth, and the 
Gospel is being preached as a witness 
to the world. 

How literally the words of President 
Woodruff have been fulfilled that he 
uttered when the Temple was dedicat- 
ed! He said that the scale would 
turn, and the people of the world 
would be more kind to us than for- 
merly. We have seen this verified 
wherever our Elders have gone. They 
find people raised up to comfort and 
to bless them and to listen to them. 
It is so in these United States, more 
so, I presume, than it ever has been; 
it is so in all the world. The words 
of the servant of God have been veri- 
fied in regard to these things. We 
have many testimonies before our eyes 
daily with regard to this work, and 
woe be to the men and the people that 
fight against God and against Zion! 
Woe be to us who have had the truth 
and have once known the light, if we 
turn away from the work of God! Our 
condition will be far worse than that 
of those who have never heard the 
Gospel. 

Hence, my brethren and sisters, the 
importance of our listening to the 
counsel of the servants of God. We 
have a perfect organization existing 
throughout the Church, so that no 
man or woman need be left in doubt 
with regard to the counsels of the 
Priesthood. We can listen to them if 
we are so disposed; and we ought to 
do it as much now as we ever have 
done. I can remember in my experi- 
ence here when, we thought it not wise 
or safe to enter into enterprises or do 
things without counseling with our 
brethren. We thought in the midst of 
counsel there was safety, and in for- 
mer years we sought the counsel of 
our brethren more than we do now. 
Not that every man shall run to the 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Presidency of the Church or to the 
Apostles to get advice, because, as I 
said before, the organization is com- 
plete, and you need not go far from 
your own wards to get the mind of 
the servants of God. If the Bishop 
is not able to give the necessary coun- 
sel, the President of the Stake may be. 
If he is not able to give it, he may 
apply to the Presidency of the Church 
for it. If this organization was con- 
sidered and respected by the Saints, 
everything would work harmoniously 
and smoothly, and every man and 
every woman would get the proper 
counsel for their guidance. 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, the 
importance of our being humble and 
consistent in our lives, in shunning 
evil and the appearance of evil, and 
to teach our children in a proper man- 
ner. Do you not know that it is a 
very bad example for any family of 
Saints to neglect their prayers be- 
fore their children? The children will 
grow up and they will not know what 
it means to have family prayers. The 
Lord has said He will be sought after, 
and He said to ancient Israel that if 
they would draw near unto Him, He 
would draw near unto them. "We need 
to draw near to the Lord, that He 
may draw near unto us. We need the 
guidance of the Holy Spirit. We are 
not able to stand alone. We need 
the counsel and encouragement of 
our brethren: we need the advice and 
encouragement of each other. We may 
think we can stand alone; we may 
think we can go on our own responsi- 
bility; but we will fail in the end, be- 
cause the Lord has designed that the 
counsel of His Priesthood shall be 
respected among the Latter-day 
Saints. We ought to sustain our 
Bishops, and not speak evil against 
them, or against the Counselors, or 
the Teachers, or the officers of the 
ward. Let not our tongues be found 
speaking evil against our brethren. It 
tends to darkness and to sin, and will 
lead whoever indulges in it out of the 
Church, unless he or she repents 
speedily. It is a dangerous thing to 
be found criticising the authorities of 
the Church— not that they are perfect 
men, because no man is perfect. It is 
possible that " may do wrong— that I 



may give some wrong counsel; but 
that can easily be corrected, because 
here are the living oracles of God, 
and they are worth more to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints than all the Bibles, all 
the Books of Mormon and all the 
Books of Doctrine and Covenants that 
are written. The Bible is a good thing, 
the Book of Mormon is a good thing, 
and the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants is a good thing. They are the 
words of the Lord. But I say that 
the living oracles of the Church are 
worth more than all of them. If we 
could have but one of them, give me 
the living oracles of the Priesthood for 
my guidance. Of course, it is proper 
and a good thing to have it all, 'be- 
cause the living oracles of the Church 
work in harmony with what is writ- 
ten, and their counsel will not come in 
conflict wth the words of the Lord in 
former ages. But the conditions of 
mankind change. The counsel that 
was suitable for the Saints forty years 
ago may not be so suitable today. 
Hence the imDortance of having in 
our midst the living oracles of God 
to guide us day by day in the per- 
formance of our labors. 

I feel that it is a good time to be 
Saints. It is a good time to turn un- 
to the Lord and live, and not turn 
away from the Lord and die. I tell 
you that God has revealed himself in 
our day and time. He has raised up 
our Presidency and the Apostles for 
the guidance of the Church, for the 
establishing of His work and the 
building up of Zion on the earth; and 
we cannot do without them. We would 
be scattered to the four winds if we 
did not have the living oracles of God 
in our midst for our guidance. I feel 
happy in this work. I hope I will con- 
tinue to the end. I have not only had 
one testimony from the Lord of its 
truth, but many have been added from 
time to time. I have seen the mar- 
velous workings of God visible in my 
behalf, and I feel this morning to 
praise the Father because of His good- 
ness and mercy, and because of His 
sparing my life to bear record of His 
name and to bear testimony to my 
brethren and sisters and friends of the 
truth and divinity of this great work. 
God bless you. Amen.

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

The Written Word Insufficient, Prophets Kaised 
up at Different Periods, — God has Revealed Him- 
self also in those Last Times. 

Dear brethren and sisters and 
friends: I pray that the Spirit of the 
Lord may direct me in what I shall 
say this morning. I feel to bear testi- 
mony, to commence with, to the truth 
of the remarks that have been made 
by those who have preceded me. I de- 
sire to draw the attention of this con- 
gregation to a statement of Elder Mer- 
rill wherein he said that the Jiving 
oracles are of greater importance 
than the written word. I desire to 
dwell somewhat upon this point, in or- 
der to bear testimony to this position; 
for it is a sweeping assertion. As 
Elder Merrill made this remark, my 
mind reverted back over the history 
of the world and the dealings of God 
the Eternal Father with the children 
of men ever since the days of our 
father Adam. We find in the begin- 
ning that the children of men multi- 
plied from our forefather Adam and 
became very numerous upon the earth, 
and they had in their midst the writ- 
ten word of God. But they departed 
from it. What was needful under 
these circumstances? Why, it became 
necessary for the Lord to raise up a 
prophet, and he inspired His servant 
Noah to call the people unto repentance 
I mention this fact to show you that 
while they had the written word of 
God in their midst, yet they had all 
departed from it. They needed the liv- 
ing word. As the prophet says, 
"the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth 
life." Another ancient prophet says, 
"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, 
but He revealeth His secret unto His 
servants the prophets." Under the 
circumstances that I have alluded to, 
it was necessary for the Lord to raise 
up a mighty prophet, and Noah there- 
fore began to preach the Gospel of re- 
pentance unto that people. He preached 
for about 120 years — with what suc- 
cess you all know who have read the 
scriptures. Eight souls, including 
himself, were saved in the ark. 

Then when these eight souls began 
to multiply and replenish the earth 
and they became a great and numer- 
ous people, while all the dealings of 
God with His people were carefully 



recorded and the word of God, as far 
as it was written, was handed down 
to them, was that sufficient to save 
and to guide them? No. It was 
necessary for the Lord to raise up 
another prophet; and various prophets 
in turn were raised up. But the peo- 
ple went so far away from the truth 
that they became idolatrous and of- 
fered hnman sacrifice. While the 
Lord had given them commandments 
concerning the principle of atonement 
by the blood of animals, etc., they be- 
gan to enlarge upon God's law and in- 
stituted the practice of offering human 
sacrifices. The Lord was very much 
displeased with this. Nevertheless 
they had the written word before them, 
but they gave no heed to it. It became 
necessary to raise up a mighty prophet. 
Therefore, the Lord came down in the 
midst of these idolaters and appeared 
unto Abraham, who was the son of 
Terah by his second wife. The Lord 
had respect to Abraham, for he was 
a good man, and He said unto Abra- 
ham: 

"Get thee out of thy country, and 
from thy kindred, and from thy fa- 
ther's house, unto a land that I will 
show thee: 

"And I will make of thee a great na- 
tion, and I will bless thee, and make 
thy name great; and tfcou shalt be 
a blessing: 

"And I will bless them that bless 
thee, and curse him that curseth thee: 
and in thee shall all families of the 
earth be blessed." 

The Lord commanded Abraham to 
leave his father's house, because his 
father, Terah, was preparing to offer 
him as a sacrifice unto his god. 

Here is another instance where you 
will see the necessity of the Lord re- 
vealing himself and raising up a 
prophet, because all the children of 
men had gone into idolatry and had 
gone astray from the plan of life and 
salvation which the Lord had previous- 
ly revealed unto them. Nevertheless 
they had the written word in their 
midst. Did the written word save 
them? No. Would the written word 
have accomplished the object of turn- 
ing that great people from idolatry? 
No. What was necessary? It was 
necessary to do just what was done 
— for our Father in heaven to come and 
make a personal visit to Abraham.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Afterwards the Lord said, in speak- 
ing of Abraham, "I know him, that he 
will command his children and his 
household after him, and they shall 
keep the way of the Lord, to do jus- 
tice and judgment." Therefore, He 
pronounced upon him the great bless- 
ing — that his posterity should become 
as innumerable as the stars in heaven 
and as countless as the sands 
upon the seashore. When the 
children of God understand true 
wealth and that which will make 
them as God, they will find it 
in presiding over their posterity in 
their turn, as our Father is now pre- 
siding over His, and in the fact that 
they have wives and children, their 
posterity increasing and multiplying, 
and the principle of the continuation 
of lives committed unto them for ever 
and ever. 

I desire to pass along a little further. 
The children of Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob began to increase and multiply 
upon the face of the earth, and became 
a great people. Nevertheless they fell 
short of keeping the commandments 
that the Lord had given unto them. 
But they had the written word in their 
midst. Did that save them? No, it 
did not. They went into bondage un- 
to the Egyptians. What was the mat- 
ter? Was it ^hat there was nothing 
written in regard to the dealings of 
God with His people prior to their day 
that they were in this dreadful con- 
dition? No. It was because they had 
transgressed the laws, changed the or- 
dinances, and had turned away from the 
laws of life and salvation. Under 
these circumstances, what was neces- 
sary? It was necessary to raise up 
a man who could communicate with 
God the Eternal Father. Again the 
written word failed to save the peo- 
ple. The Lord appeared unto Moses 
in the burning bush, and commanded 
him to go forth and call to his assist- 
ance his brother Aaron, and say unto 
Pharaoh, in the name of the Lord, to 
let His people go forth into the wilder- 
ness. Would the written word ever 
have prevailed upon King Pharaoh 
to release the people of Israel? No. 
It was necessary for the Lord to show 
forth His mighty power in bringing 
upon that people the plagues of the 
earth, according to the voice of His 
servant Moses, whom He had inspired. 
It was necessary also for the Lord to 



smite down the first-born of all the 
Egyptians. Would the written word 
have accomplished that? Moses went 
forth, after having conversed with 
God, filled with a portion of His Spirit 
and power. He did not go forth with 
the written word of something that 
had transpired in the days of Noah, 
saying, Behold, Noah was called of God 
to preach righteousness, and the peo- 
ple did not repent; therefore they 
were destroyed with a flood. -.o; 
King Pharaoh undoubtedly was ac- 
quainted with the history of the world, 
but that had no more effect upon him 
than the blowing of the wind. But 
when the Prophet Moses came into his 
presence, and the plagues were 
poured out, one by one, upon the peo- 
ple, according to the will of God as 
predicted by His servant Moses, he 
began to soften in his heart. Finally, 
when the firstborn of Egypt were des- 
troyed, the Israelites had time 
enough to get out into the wilderness; 
but they had no sooner got out than 
they were immediately followed by 
the hosts of Pharaoh. 

I mention this to show you the ne- 
cessity of another prophet being 
raised up. I tell you there might have 
lived in ages past hundreds and thou- 
sands of prophets, but that is not suf- 
ficient for the day and age in which 
we live. I will pass on rapidly, for 
I have only four minutes left in which 
to speak; but I desire to talk to the 
subject as well as to the "mark" while 
I am on my feet. 

There is another remarkable cir- 
cumstance I wish to refer to. The 
Lord our God desired that a mighty 
temple should be built unto His high 
and holy name, after the days of 
which I have spoken. Was there any- 
thing in what the Lord had said to 
the Prophet Noah, or to the Prophet 
Abraham, or to the Prophet Isaac, or 
to the Prophet Jacob, that would 
teach the children of men how to build 
a temple unto God? No; there was no 
written word of this kind. What was 
necessary, therefore? It was neces- 
sary that the Lord our God should 
reveal His mind and will unto His 
servant the Prophet, that he might 
know how to build a temple; and He 
raised up a man to build a temple un- 
to the name of God. This was King 
Solomon. A little later on we find an-

other peculiar circumstance which 
transpired, verifying the ideas of 
Elder Merrill in his testimony here 
today. We find that King Nebuchad- 
nezzar had a dream concerning some 
of the future history of this world, 
portraying what the mind and will of 
God was concerning some things 
down even to the day and age in 
which we live. But the dream went 
from him, and he wanted this dream 
brought back to his mind with the in- 
terpretation thereof. Could he by 
reading the instructions of God to 
Solomon as to how to build a temple 
learn how to bring that dream back 
again to his mind? No; it was neces- 
sary for the Lord to call upon His 
servant Daniel, who went forth, and 
by the power of the Holy Ghost he 
told the dream and gave its interpre- 
tation to Nebuchadnezzar. 

I tell you the changing scenes of 
life are such that we need men, living 
men, that are inspired of God. As 
Christ said to the devil, when he 
tempted Him, "Man shall not live by 
bread alone, but by every word that 
proceedeth out of the mouth of God." 
I desire, my friends, to bear this testi- 
mony unto you. Let me quote from 
the 12th chapter of Paul's first epistle 
to the Corinthians, and pass by all 
the remarkable circumstances where- 
in God the Eternal Father had to con- 
tinually keep raising up Prophets and 
Seers, in order to straighten the peo- 
ple out; for the history of this world 
shows that just as soon as the people 
have a little time to multiply and to 
increase, they have turned away from 
the word of God. When Christ came, 
He instituted a peculiar system 
among the children of men, and Paul 
speaks of some things that He es~ 
tablished in His Church. 

"God hath set some in the Church, 
first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, 
thirdly Teachers, after that miracles, 
then gifts of healing, helps, govern- 
ments, diversities of tongues." 

In his epistle to the Ephesians, Paul 
also speaks on this subject. He says: 

"And he gave some, Apostles; and 
some, Prophets; and some, Evange- 
lists; and some, Pastors and Teachers; 

"For the perfecting of the Saints, for 
the work of the ministry, for the edi- 
fying of the body of Christ: 



"That we henceforth be no more 
children, tossed to and fro, and carried 
about with every wind of doctrine, by 
the sleight of men, and cunning crafti- 
ness, whereby they lie in wait to de- 
ceive." 

We are told also in the same epistle 
that God has placed these in the 
church "till we all come in the unity 
of the faith." I ask you, my friends, 
have we come to a unity of the faith 
in the world? We are divided, and sub- 
divided, into hundreds of sects and 
parties. Then what is necessary? 
Why, as in the other circumstances to 
which I have referred, it is necessary 
that the Lord our God should raise up 
a mighty prophet, to correct the chil- 
dren of men in this great error which 
they are making all over the world. 
And in accordance with this necessity, 
the Lord has in this time, as in all 
ages, come to the rescue, and He has 
raised up the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
as a prophet, seer and revelator. 
He came down and communicated 
His mind and will unto the Prophet 
Joseph in person, as He did unto 
our father Abraham, and unto 
Jacob, and unto Moses; and He 
has commanded, as President Wood- 
ruff has said here today, that this Gos- 
pel of the kingdom shall be preached 
in all the world, for a witness to all 
nations, and then shall the end come. 
Is not all the sectarian world today 
praying, "Our Father who art in hea- 
ven, thy kingdom come.and thy will be 
done?" Let me say unto you, my dear 
friends, when it does come it will 
come with apostles, with prophets, 
with inspired men, with men who are 
raised up as men were in olden times. 
Peter said, "If any man speak, let him 
speak as the oracles of God." In those 
days they spake not as the Scribes and 
Pharisees, but as men having author- 
ity. They spake not according to the 
will of man, but whatsoever was re- 
vealed unto them that spake they unto 
the children of men. 

God bless you, my dear friends, and 
lead you into the ways of all truth. 
May He pour out His Holy Spirit upon 
every soul that is in this Conference, 
that the Latter-day Saints may be 
made to rejoice, and that those who 
are not of us may be pricked in their 
hearts and come to a knowledge of

the truth, that we may all be saved 
and exalted in His kingdom, is my 
prayer, in tLe name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

The Doctrine Preached by the Saints the Same as 
that which was Taught by Christ. 

I am grateful unto God our Eternal 
Father for the privilege of attending 
this Conference. I think the Latter-day 
Saints may congratulate themselves in 
the testimony that hath been given un- 
to us, that has relieved us from all 
doubt or anxiety concerning our spir- 
itual welfare today or in the future.The 
doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ is 
different to anything else. To believe 
on the Lord Jesus Christ is to believe 
in His doctrine. If we believe in His 
doctrine, we believe in the ordinances 
of the house of God. "We understand 
somewhat concerning our relationship 
to our Father in heaven. He taught 
His disciples to pray, 'Our Father 
which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy 
name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will 
be done on earth as it is done in 
heaven." This is the sentiment of the 
Latter-day Saints — those who are 
sanctified in Christ Jesus, who have 
accepted the doctrine of Jesus Christ, 
who worship the living and true God, 
who have repented of their sins, who 
have been baptized by immersion, by 
one having authority, for the remis- 
sion of their sins, who have been 
sanctified in the precious blood of 
Christ, which follows the water, and 
who have received the witness of the 
Spirit in the gift of the Holy Ghost 
that was given unto them by the ordi- 
nance of the laying on of hands. The 
principles that we advocate are the 
principles advocated by the Lord 
Jesus Christ in His day; and are the 
only way to be saved from death, hell 
and the grave. 

We have our missionaries, in large 
numbers, preaching this everlasting 
Gospel, who are taking the glad tid- 
ings of great joy to the inhabitants of 
the earth, testifying that God has 
again spoken from the heavens, that 
He hath restored to the earth His 
Church, that He hath living Apostles 
and Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors 
and Teachers, for the work of the 



ministry, and for the edifying of the 
body of Christ. We also testify to the 
truth of these principles, because in 
our experience as individuals we 
know that the signs follow the be- 
liever; we know that the path of coun- 
sel is the path of safety; for whenever 
we have followed it we have always 
been well satisfied. The ways of God 
are not the ways of man, neither are 
His thoughts their thoughts; but as the 
heavens are above the earth, so are 
His thoughts andHis ways above ours. 
Men for ages have had the Scriptures. 
They have had the dealings of God 
with the inhabitants of the earth in 
the records that we have. But have 
they been enabled to understand the 
philosophy of salvation? Have they 
been enabled to understand why it 
was necessary that all men must re- 
pent, and be baptized (immersed) for 
the remission of sins? Have they 
been enabled to understand why it 
was essential that they should be born 
of the water and of the spirit, or they 
could in no wise inherit the kingdom of 
God? These principles are made plain 
to us, because the Lord has revealed 
them. He has restored His new and 
everlasting convenant. He has re- 
stored His holy Gospel. We are His 
witnesses of this, and we testify that 
which we do know, and we bear testi- 
mony to that which we have seen and 
that which we have felt. 

But the world will not receive our tes- 
timony. We take the Bible and show 
that these principles are in harmony 
with those taught by the ancient Apos- 
tles. It is no new doctrine. It is 
the old doctrine. It is the straight 
and narrow path that leads to eternal 
life. And we are endeavoring to 
train our children and the people to 
have faith in God, to trust in the Lord, 
to honor Him, to reverence His name, 
to love Him, and to keep His holy 
commandments. In our Sabbath 
schools we show the children what has 
been done by faith. In our exhorta- 
tions to the people we refer them to 
what has been accomplished by faith; 
believing in God, and that He is a re- 
warder of those who diligently seek 
Him, believing in His ordinances, and 
practicing them, that they may make 
their calling and election sure. We are 
striving to do this ourselves, simply

because we want a salvation; 
we want to be associated with 
the Church of the firstborn; we want 
to see the kingdom of God established 
upon the earth in power, that the 
kingdom of heaven may come and the 
will of God be done upon the earth as 
the angels do the same in the heavens. 

I will say to our friends visiting at 
this Conference, if you have not heard 
this Gospel before, I want to bear 
testimony to you that I came out of 
the world; that I heard this Gospel in 
the world; that I accepted of its prin- 
ciples, and the promises made to me 
by those who introduced it to me 
have been fulfilled. I know that the 
spirit of prophecy exists. I know 
that the gift of tongues exists. I 
know that the power of God is mani- 
fested, when faith is exercised, in the 
laying on of hands unto those who are 
sick and afflicted, in the anointing with 
oil and the prayer of faith. I know 
that the signs follow the believer, as 
the Lord Jesus Christ promised eigh- 
teen hundred years ago. The Lord 
has again revealed His will. He taught 
His servant Joseph Smith His doctrine 
and the necessity of these ordinances of 
His house, and has taught the neces- 
sity of adding works to our faith. 

What would be the use of the Scrip- 
tures to us if there were no living men 
having authority to officiate in the 
ordinances of the house of God. Where 
there is no authority of the Priesthood 
there cannot be any ordinances, to be 
of any effect. You can easily under- 
stand that the things of God are not 
known by the spirit of man, but by 
the Spirit of God; and when the Lord 
withdraws His Spirit, and when His 
authority is taken from the earth, 
then men of wisdom, so-called, change 
the ordinances, break the everlasting 
covenant, and instead of baptizing by 
immersion, that men may be buried 
with Christ by baptism, they pour or 
sprinkle water upon a child's face and 
call that baptism. Now, if the ordi- 
nance of baptism that was 
given unto us by the Lord 
Jesus Christ was being buried 
with Christ in baptism, how would it 
be possible for us to be justified by 
having a little water sprinkled in our 
faces when we were little children and 
knew nothing about it? So much for 



the wisdom of men. No man knoweth 
the things of God, except by the Spirit 
of God. When they had living Apos- 
tles and Prophets, Evangelists, Pas- 
tors and Teachers, sent of God for 
the work of the ministry, then the 
proper ordinance of going down into 
the water and coming up out of the 
water was performed. 

The Lord has taught us these prin- 
ciples today in the revelations that 
He has given. He has given us the 
ordinance of baptism, the ordinance of 
the laying on of hands; and when we 
look into the Scriptures we find that 
it was just the same eighteen hun- 
dred years ago. The Scriptures bear 
testimony, or we can quote from the 
Scriptures to show the people that it 
is no new doctrine. We have a living 
testimony, too, in the which we know 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
that there is efficacy in His precious 
blood, and that if we walk in the 
light as He is in the light we have fel- 
lowship with our brethren, and the 
blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us 
from all sin. We have faith in these 
principles, and we honor God. We 
manifest it in our works. We are not 
teaching false doctrine. We are not 
deceiving the people. We are teach- 
ing them the truth, and we call upon 
all men everywhere to repent and to 
come unto God with a broken heart 
and a contrite spirit, and worship 
Him in the name of Jesus Christ. 

If you are honest in your hearts, and 
desire to know God, whom to know is 
eternal life, He will lead you into His 
fold, as he has done us; He will re- 
veal to you the principles of 
life and salvation, as He has done to 
us; He will give you a living 
testimony, as he has given us. We 
invite all men to come unto Christ. 
We prove our doctrine by the Scrip- 
tures. We know that these principles 
are true. We know it in our experi- 
ence and in our associations; we 
know it by the signs following the 
believer, and we are grateful to God 
our Eternal Father, beyond expression, 
that we have the privilege of being 
called by His name, and we love to do 
His will and honor His ordinances. 
Every man that has the fellowship of 
the Spirit of God loves the ways of 
the Lord. He cannot help it, it is so

glorious. The Gospel has been of great 
benefit and worth unto me. It re- 
deemed me from the darkness I was 
in; it redeemed me from priestcraft, 
from superstition and folly, and has 
given me the privilege of the glorious 
light that shines in Zion. But the 
light shineth in darkness, and the 
darkness comprehendeth it not. Why 
do the people love darkness rather 
than light? Because their deeds are 
evil. That is the interpretation that 
Jesus Christ gave, and I believe it. 
Why should we not be united in the 
worship of the living God? Why should 
we not be laboring for the building up 
of His kingdom? What is the use of 
broken cisterns that hold no water? 
What is the use of trusting in the wis- 
dom of men, or in the arm of flesh? 
Why not trust in the living and true 
God? Why not wait upon Him, and 
place our faith in Him? Why not 
dedicate ourselves unto His kindly 
care and protection? I know that He 
lives. I know that He hears and an- 
swers prayer. I know that He blesses 
the administrations of His servants. 
How do I know it? Why, in my ex- 
perience. There is scarcely a day 
passes but we have some witness con- 
cerning the mercy of God and His 
goodness. I have never been enabled to 
express my gratitude to my Father in 
heaven, and I have always been will- 
ing to preach this Gospel, because it 
has been such a blessing unto me. 

I remember during the time I was 
on a mision I published two tracts — 
"The Glad Tidings of Great Joy" and 
"The Restoration of the Everlasting 
Gospel." What did I do it for? Be- 
cause this Gospel has been such a bene- 
fit and blessing to me that I wanted to 
do all that I could to tell my brethren 
and sisters of the world everywhere 
concerning it. We are the friends of 
mankind. We have shown it by 
taking our lives in our hands 
over and over again to teach 
them the truth. We plead with 
them to be reconciled with God, and 
to embrace these glorious principles. 
I was trained in the scriptures. The 
people say that we do not believe in 
the Bible. If that be the case there 
are no people on the earth that do be- 
lieve in the Bible. We do believe in it, 
and we believe in the doctrines of 
Christ. It was a simple tract that 



came into my hand— The Only Way to 
be Save*, by Apostle Lorenzo Snow— 
and then afterwards the Voice of 
Warning, that caused me to reflect 
and brought me to associate with this 
people and to wait upon the Lord. It 
aroused the spirit of faith in me. 

Now, my beloved brethren and sis- 
ters, let me say unto you, as the 
Apostle said of old, have faith in God; 
for without faith it is impossible to 
please Him. This is what the Lord 
requires of us. He will be enquired af- 
ter. As far as salvation is concerned, 
it is between the individual and God, 
between the child and the Father. 
He is our Father in heaven. We en- 
treat you to put yourselves in har- 
mony with Him; humble yourselves 
before Him and cry unto Him as a re- 
pentant sinner, and ask Him for light 
and truth. He will not deceive you, 
and truth. He will give it you. He 
will not deceive you, but guide you in 
the strait and narrow path which leads 
to everlasting life. 

I bear my testimony concerning the 
Presidency and the Apostles, with 
whom I have been associated for some 
time. I know that they are men of 
God. I know that they labor for the 
establishment of the righteousness of 
God upon the earth. I know that they 
are men called of God. I have had their 
hands on my head, and they have 
predicted concerning me, when I have 
been sent on missions, and I know 
that they had the spirit cf prophecy, 
because those predictions were ful- 
filled. Then in my associations with 
them in the work of the Lord. I 
know that they are men of God; and I 
know that the Latter-day Saints who 
are living their religion are the happi- 
est people on the face of the earth, and 
the Lord blesses them and gives unto 
them the righteous desires of their 
hearts. I am grateful unto God for 
this privilege that I have of bearing 
my testimony this morning in this 
Conference, and I pray that we may 
be kind to each other, that we may 
love God and keep His commandments, 
that when we shall have finished our 
probation upon the earth, we may en- 
ter into His glorious rest, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Necessity of a strict observance of the Sabbath. — 
Permissable enjoyment and recreatien on week 
days. — Effects of Sabbath-breaking upon our 
children. 

I am happy in the opportunity of 
listening, as I did this forenoon, to the 
remarks that were made by our breth- 
ren who spoke to us; and I was es- 
pecially pleased that President Wood- 
ruff was enabled to be here and open 
this Conference by speaking for a short 
period of time. I trust that during the 
time I may occupy, I may be permitted 
to enjoy the same spirit that was en- 
joyed by our brethren in their conver- 
sations this morning. I have no sub- 
ject upon my mind at this moment, but 
I trust that the suggestions of the 
Spirit .may point out the direction in 
which I should go, that I may be en- 
abled to touch upon some subject or 
other that shall be of interest to you. 

During the past few months, in visit- 
ing the stake conferences and also in 
attending meetings in various wards, I 
have been very strongly impressed 
with the necessity for a much more 
strict observance of the Sabbath day 
than the Saints have been giving to it, 
and in talking to the people I have 
been more impressed to speak upon 
that matter than upon any other. 

No people in the world have been 
dealt more generously with in the line 
of enjoyment — proper enjoyment — than 
the Latter-day Saints. Other religious 
peoples take little of those lighter en- 
joyments, and seem to regard them as 
sinful. But to us the Lord has been 
generous, in that we have been per- 
mitted to enjoy ourselves in witnessing 
representations upon the "mimic 
stage," to also have some pleasure in 
parties, and to enjoy ourselves in danc- 
ing. A great many religious people re- 



gard these representations upon the 
stage, also dancing, as improper and 
wrong; but I myself am most happy 
in the thought that our Heavenly 
Father, in the introducing of His work 
and in seeking to establish among His 
children a correct understanding of the 
obligations and requirements of life, 
has permitted us the opportunity of 
lightening our minds, changing our 
currents of thought, and devoting our- 
selves to reasonable and proper amuse- 
ments, that the mind might be freed 
from its constant load or strain oc- 
casioned by its so continuously pursu- 
ing the directions of those weightier 
conditions and obligations, and the 
continuance of thought upon them, by 
which the mind becomes overcharged 
and, as a result, produces sickness and 
feebleness, without there is some way 
in which it can be relieved. To my 
mind, the spirit and feeling and senti- 
ment engendered in legitimate and pro- 
per amusements produces a most 
pleasing and satisfactory effect and re- 
sult upon the mind that is thus per- 
mitted to throw off its weightier 
thoughts and enter upon legitimate 
and proper amusements, freeing it 
and enabling it to carry its weightier 
burdens more easily and more fully 
and mdre thoroughly. 

But I notice that while this spirit of 
amusement is legitimate and proper in 
the sphere of our every-day life, the 
tendency seems to be growing among 
many to disregard the Sabbath day 
and to change it from the day of wor- 
ship, the day of rest, the day upon 
which we may be enabled to commune 
with our own thoughts and to reach 
out after the inspiration of the Spirit 
of God— that tendency, I say, is a 
growing one, to change that day into 
a day of pleasure; and to my mind, as 
I look around and note that tendency, 
I am sanguine that it is not for the 
best, but, upon the contrary, that, un- 
less proper means shall be adopted to 
change this tendency, the sacred char- 
acter of that day and the obligation 
that rests upon us as the children of 
our Heavenly Father to worship Him, 
is going to result badly; and it looks 
to me that an earnest effort should be 
made by the Elders of the Church to 
more deeply impress upon the minds of 
those of middle age and upon the 
younger and growing generations, the

sacredness of that day. There is no 
reason that can be assigned among the 
Latter-day Saints why it should be 
turned into a day of pleasure-seeking, 
a day of recreation. 

The opportunities given in which we 
can enjoy ourselves with propriety in 
our social gatherings during the week 
should be appreciated by us; and while 
we may be required to labor, our time 
being largely utilized in the various 
employments upon which we enter in 
order to obtain our livelihood, these op- 
portunities for recreation present them- 
selves continuously before us. I feel 
in connection with this matter that we 
need — and we need it very badly too, 
taken as a whole — to have the entire 
time that comes as the Sabbath day to 
devote our minds and our hearts to 
communion with that Spirit that comes 
from on high. Laboring and struggl- 
ing daily and hourly to meet the 
physical needs of man, or to gratify 
some desire in the line of amusement, 
our minds are taken away from that 
regard and respect to the Sabbath day, 
and that regard and reverence and re- 
spect to the requirements of our Heav- 
enly Father in connection with the 
softening of our minds and putting 
our spirits in touch with Him, that 
the tendency to simply go to Sabbath 
school or to attend one service upon 
the Sabbath day, either in the Taber- 
nacle or in the ward meeting houses, or 
other buildings, and then to 
hitch up our teams and drive 
about the city, or into the 
canyons, or to be found following 
up the streams and fishing, and in- 
dulging in these species of recreation, 
to my mind is not in keeping with the 
spirit and nature of the work the Lord 
has set us to do. I believe that so far 
as may be practicable, our animals 
should have the same opportunites for 
rest upon the Sabbath day that we 
have. It is true that there may be 
circumstances arising, in order to dis- 
charge the legitimate and proper du- 
ties that rest upon us, that we may 
be compelled to drive our teams, or 
that we may be compelled, through 
sickness or otherwise, to be found not 
performing in its strictness the 
duties attendant upon us as members 
of the body of Christ; but with the 
generous opportunities that have been 
given to us for amusement, the chance 



that is ours to change our cur- 
rent of thought, and the require- 
ment laid upon our Father's children, 
not alone in the ages that have gone 
by, but in these days that they should 
remember the Sabbath day and keep 
it holy, we can avoid these evils. 

Again in this dispensation, the Lord 
has renewed His covenant with His 
children, and pointed out to them the 
course they should pursue in regard to 
His work. Yet day by day or Sabbath 
by Sabbath, in mingling among the 
people, in noting the conditions that 
arise, as the tendency to the violation 
of the Sabbath and to disregard the 
sacredness of that holy day increases, 
I see that infidelity will increase, be- 
cause to indulge upon that day in the 
same species of labor or careless 
amusement common upon other days, 
and to neglect and disregard the obli- 
gations we owe to that day rendered 
sacred by our Father in Heaven, upon 
which we should approach Him, will 
increase the spirit of disregard for 
our Heavenly Father in the breasts of 
those who indulge in it. I do not wish, 
in any sense, to become cranky, as we 
sometimes say of our brethren who 
strike upon a hobby and seem to work 
at it continuously, but, to my mind, 
there has grown to be a reckless disre- 
gard of that sacred requirement of 
holding holy and sacred the Sabbath 
day, in the minds of a great body of 
people who profess to be Latter-day 
Saints. It is not confined to the 
boys and girls who drift away from 
the restraints that should exist in the 
home, but it is manifest among those 
of more mature years. It is seen in 
many places and under many condi- 
tions, and it is repeated Sabbath after 
Sabbath, from month's end to month's 
end, and from year's end to year's end, 
and I trust that the faith and respect 
and reverence that should be shown in 
connection with the sacred observance 
of that day, devoted by our Heavenly 
Father to the enlightenment and up- 
lifting of His children in the knowledge 
of Himself, shall not be held so lightly 
as it seems to be growing to be in the 
minds of many people who profess to 
believe upon His name, but that, 
wherever it may be possible, they will 
obey His wish, and hold sacred His 
day, that with themselves and their 
households, they will attend the ser-

vices of the Church, and, if unable so to 
do, within the sacred folds of their 
own home circle will study the 
scriotures and seek to impress upon 
their minds a knowledge of His pur- 
poses, as shown in the sacred things 
which have come to us. 

I feel that in connection with this 
matter, a change should take place 
with us; and while we may not 
be enabled to avoid some seem- 
ing violations of that sacred day, 
I believe that the spirit of every 
member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Later-day Saints should be 
directed to a more careful and 
thoughtful and prudent observance 
of the obligations which attach to us 
in connection with that day; that those 
teams and our vehicles, that those 
that are dependent upon us, shall be 
made to feel and sense the saeredness 
of that day and their duty to their 
Maker; that their minds may be 
eased of the strain of their week-day 
labor, and have communion with the 
Holy Spirit, that spirit that brings 
joy and gladness, that awakens hope, 
that puts us in sacred touch with our 
Heavenly Father, and renders us 
obedient to His holy wish, — that that 
spirit may be with them and direct 
and guide them into its strict observ- 
ance. I believe that carriage riding 
and buggy riding in this city and in 
these larger cities among the Saints, 
has grown to be a crime, and that our 
Heavenly Father is not pleased with 
it. That is my spirit and feeling in 
regard to that matter. President Can- 
non asks, "What about bicycles?" 
Well, I say this, my brethren and sis- 
ters, in regard to this question of rid- 
ing of horses and bicycles, the driv- 
ing of teams, and such like upon the 
Sabbath day: I recognize that many 
are so situated, being miles away 
from places of worship, that they 
must of necessity drive their teams 
in order to take their families to their 
legitimate and proper places of wor- 
ship, — I have nothing to say with 
reference to this matter, but when Our 
teams are hitched up every Sabbath 
afternoon and driven for hours and 
hotirs for pleasure, I think we trench 
upon ground upon which we should 
not enter. I think, brethren and 
Sisters. remembering the good- 
ness Of our Father to us, that while 
the rest of the religious world feel 



that it is a crime upon their part to 
have social enjoyments, our Father 
has permitted us to have these, going 
upon the basis that reasonable pleas- 
ure is legitimate and right, and draw- 
ing our minds from the weighty loads 
that come to men and women in their 
struggle of life; but O, let us hold 
sacred that day that our Father has 
named as the day upon which we, as 
His children, taught in the principles 
of righteousness, should show our love 
for Him, and our love for the princi- 
ples involved in good government, in 
the balancing and shaping of the mind 
in its currents of thought along 
religious channels, and not be in a 
condition that our minds shall be 
given wholly to the enjoyment or pur- 
suit of pleasure alone, or to the 
weighty obligations of life, to the 
business affairs of life, that drift us 
away from the sacred communion of 
the Holy Spirit. 

My brethren and sisters, I ask that 
you who are under the sound of my 
voice this day will bear in remem- 
brance that God has decreed that the 
Sabbath day should be held sacred 
and holy in His sight, and He expects 
us, His sons and His daughters, to so 
regard it in our ministrations and 
labors, to only discharge such duties 
as rest upon us, that are impossible 
for us to avoid but which come 
legitimately and cannot be avoided. 
My witness to you is that they who 
remember the Sabbath day, who shall 
take the rest proposed in the change 
of thought, who shall do it in at- 
tendance upon the sacred service, 
where the worship of God is present, 
will live longer lives, will be made 
more acceptable in every respect to 
our Heavenly Father; and in their 
children and their children's children 
will the impress of that spirit to hold 
sacred the day of rest and worship 
be manifest in their lives, which will 
bring joy and satisfaction to the 
fathers and mothers because of the 
course that they pursue. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord 
may indeed be in our midst, that the 
determination shall be a fixed and es- 
tablished one that in the homes of 
the Latter-day Saints, wherever they 
may be situated.shall be found a people 
who revere and respect the sacred day 
which God has designated as a day of

res j, that that day shall not become 
a day of pleasure but, upon the con- 
trary, a day of worship, of reverence, 
and love for the Supreme Being, and 
that each one will seek to do his 
Father's bidding in this respect, and 
keep His commandments. Amen.

Sacred ground. — Maintaining Kepentance. — Ten- 
derness of heart.— Moslah's teachings. — God 
never fails. 

Twenty-five minutes will not be a 
very long practice at the mark 
straight ahead of us, but I will en- 
deavor to talk straight, with the 
help of the Lord and with the help of 
your faith and prayers, my brethren 
and sisters, and trust that something 
may be said that will be profitable to 
us. 

While listening to the brethren to- 
day, I have thought of this sacred 
spot, this building, this sacred ground 
where the Latter-day Saints are wont 
to assembl? twice a year from all over 
the Church, coming here to listen to 
the living oracles, the men who have 
been chosen by the Lord, upon whose 
shoulders rests the responsibility of 
this Church and this work which the 
Lord has established, and O, what a 
sacred spot this is destined to be! 
When I think of the great designer 
of this building, President Young, and 
his brethren who have occupied the 
stand, the pulpit here, and how freely 
the word of the Lord has come to the 
people by the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, words of wisdom, words of 
intelligence, words fraught with the 
power of God, I think what wonderful 
occasions have been in this building! 
How we have rejoiced together, and 
how we have been fed and stimu- 
lated to go forth from this central 
spot to our various fields of labor, to 
serve the Lord anew, to renew our en- 
ergies, our covenants and obligations 
to the Lord and to more faithfully 
keep His commandments, that we 
may make good our great undertak- 
ing; to repent of our sins and to ob- 
tain forgiveness; to make a repent- 
ance genuine and eternal; for I am 
brought to believe that it is possible 
for men to repent and then to unre- 
pent, and to fail to keep their repent- 



ance good; and I believe that the vic- 
tory is in retaining our repentance 
and making it good, so that the Spirit 
of the Lord may dwell richly with us. 
I believe that it has been a fault with 
the Latter-day Saints, with us all, 
perhaps, without exception, that we 
have not properly maintained oar re- 
pentance a?id kept it good; that we 
have, after we have embraced the 
Gospel and have received baptism 
properly, slackened our course; that 
we have become careless; that we 
have not maintained the broken heart 
and the contrite spirit, for be it known, 
it is necessary that men should havo 
the broken heart, the tender and soft 
heart, and the contrite spirit, or they 
are not worthy of that great ordinance 
of baptism of water and of fire and of 
the Holy Ghost. And when we have 
reached this point, that we have com- 
plied with the revelation which is so 
clear and pointed, so definite that no 
one can mistake, I believe that that 
same condition must be maintained. 
I believe that my heart should be as 
tender today as it ever was. I cannot 
afford to be hard-hearted, I cannot 
afford to be stubborn, I cannot afford 
to be haughty and high-minded; but T 
must be contrite in spirit and my 
heart broken and tender, for the 
Lord has prescribed that all those who 
humble themselves before God and de- 
sire to be baptized should come forth 
with broken hearts and contrite 
spirits, and witness before the 
Church that they have truly repented 
of their sins and are willing to take 
upon them the name of Jesus Christ, 
having a determination to serve Him 
to the end. He says: 'All who truly 
manifest by their works that thej T 
have received of the Spirit of Christ 
unto the remission of their sins shall 
be received by baptism into this 
Church." I take it that this re t uire- 
ment is necessary to entitle us to bap- 
tism into this Church, and no person is 
entitled to baptism who comes not to 
that condition. And if it be necessary 
that that condition is reached, or 
shall be reached, by those who would 
be baptized into this Church and have 
their sins washed away.to entitle them 
to receive the Holy Ghost, I bolieve 
that it is necessary also that that re- 
pentance and that broken heart and

that contrite spirit and those good 
works before the Church, shou!d be 
continued, and manifested to the end 
of life, if we would have the blessing 
of eternal life. King Benjamin, in 
talking to his people, in the fourth 
chapter of Mosiah (Book of Mormon), 
says : 

"And again I say unto you, as I 
have said before, that as ye have come 
to the knowledge of the glory of God, 
or if ye have known of His goodness, 
and have tasted of His love, and have 
received a remission of your sins, which 
causeth you exceeding great ;ioy in 
your souls, even so I would that ye 
should remember.and always retain in 
remembrance, the greatness of God, 
and your own nothingness, and His 
goodness and longsuffering toward 
you, unworthy creatures, and humble 
yourselves, even in the depths of hu- 
mility, calling on the name of the 
Lord daily and standing steadfastly in 
the faith of that which is to come, 
which was spoken by the mouth of 
the angel; and behold, I say unto 
you, that if ye do this, ye shall al- 
ways rejoice, and be filled with the 
love of God, and always retain a re- 
mission of your sins; and ye shall 
grow in the knowledge of the glory of 
Him that created you, or in the 
knowledge of that which is just and 
true. And ye will not have a mind to 
injure one another, but to live peace- 
ably, and to render to every man ac- 
cording to that which is his due," 

Further, King Benjamin says, in 
this same chapter: 

'And now, for the sake of these 
things which I have spoken unto you; 
that is, for the sake of retaining a re- 
mission of your sins from day to Jay, 
that ye may walk guiltless before God, 
I would that ye should impart cf your 
substance to the poor, every man ac- 
cording to that which he hath, such 
as feeding the hungry, clothing the 
naked, visiting the sick, and adminis- 
tering to their relief, both spiritually 
and temporally, according to their 
wants And see that all these 
things are done in wisdom and 
order, for it is not requisite 
that a man should run faster 
than he has strength. And again: it 
is expedient that he should be diligent, 
that thereby he might win the prize; 
therefore all things must be done in 
order. And I would that ye should re- 
member, that whosoever among you 
that borroweth from his neighbor, 
should return the thing that he 
borroweth, according as he doth 
agree, or else thou shalt sin, and per- 
haps thou shalt cause thy neigh! or to 
commit sin also. And, finally, I cannot 
tell you all the things whereby ye 
may commit sin; fcr there are divers 
ways and means, even so many that 



I cannot number them. But this 
much I can tell you, that if ye do not 
watch yourselves, and your thoughts, 
and your words, and your deeds, 
and observe the commandments 
of God, and continue in the 
faith of what ye have heard con- 
cerning the coming of our Lord, even 
unto the end of your lives, ye must 
perish. And now, O man, remember 
and perish not." 

What great favor we enjoy, my 
brethren and sisters, that we have 
come to the plan of life, that we have 
come to know the way that leads to 
life and salvation, to know the Lord, 
to become acquainted with Him, 
having learned of Him through the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, to 
know that Jesus is the Christ, to 
know that He is the Son of God and 
the Savior, and that we have been 
taught the principles of repentance, 
and that we have been brought to un- 
derstand it and appreciate it! How 
important it is, then, that we should 
remain faithful, that we should per- 
severe, that we should maintain the 
conditions upon which we entered 
into this Church. It is not that a cer- 
tain condition is necessary for us to 
come through the door and then that 
we may unbend and do as we choose; 
but it is important that we should 
keep the faith. It is important that 
we should keep our hearts broken and 
tender, and our spirits contrite, and 
meek, and lowly of heart, that we 
should remember the Lord day by day, 
and that we should honor Him and 
keep His commandments and work 
righteousness, for we have the power. 
The power is in us. The Lord has 
given it to us, and the Lord has given 
to all men the power to do good and 
to honor Him and to keep His com- 
mandments. Naturally all men are 
endowed with this power from on 
high. There is planted in the hearts 
of all men that spark of intelligence 
and of righteousness from God, and 
that perception of the truth known as 
the conscience of man. It is a moni- 
tor established in the heart of every 
man and every woman, by the inspi- 
ration of the Almighty. And that 
conscience should be kept unsullied. 
It should be kept free, uncontami- 
nated, and it should improve, for, un- 
der the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, 
to which those are entitled who hum- 



1 8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ble themselves before God, the con- 
sciences of men should become so 
tender and so susceptible of impres- 
sions that they would rebel against 
the insinuation of evil, however small 
it might be. For the conscience, in- 
stead of being "seared with a hot 
iron," should be improved, should be 
intensified and made stronger and bet- 
ter in the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints, for we are entitled to a su- 
perior power and intelligence. 

The Holy Ghost, that brings us in 
communion with the Father, and that 
establishes us as the living oracles- 
not alone the Presidency of the 
Church, not alone the Apostles, not 
alone the officials of the Church gen- 
eraly,— but I say that the Holy Ghost 
in the hearts of the Elders of Israel 
makes them the living oracles of God, 
and they are entitled to speak by the 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost; they 
are entitled to know the truth, and 
not to be deceived. They are entitled 
to be led and counseled as they can- 
not be led by the written word, as we 
heard this morning, and yet no peo- 
ple of the world prize more the 
revelations of the Lord that are 
written than do the Latter-day 
Saints. But it has been the living 
oracles of God that produced the writ- 
ten word, and that always must pro- 
duce the written word — not the writ- 
ten word that produces the living ora- 
cles. But the living oracles are those 
men whom God has chosen and has 
inspired and given responsibility to. 
Those are the living oracles of God, 
and they are the men that the Lord 
sustains and strengthens and pre- 
serves, and to whom He reveals His 
mind and will. And they labor among 
the people, they live among the people, 
and they go to the world and preach 
the Gospel, advertising the prin- 
ciples of life and salvation 
abroad to the world, calling 
men to repentance and to refor- 
mation. These are the living oracles, 
and we should be the living oracles, 
and we should keep good the obliga- 
tions that we are under to the Lord, 
and the promises we have made to 
Him, for He never fails. Our Heaven- 
ly Father has never failed. He cannot 
fail. His promises are all good to us. 
The failures are upon our part. It 



tvus no failure — it has never been a 
failure on the part of the Lord, in 
the choice of brethren to serve Him 
and to bear His responsibility, to bear 
His Priesthood and authority among 
lien. The failures have been the fail- 
Ares of men, on account of the weak- 
nesses of men, of human nature. But 
where men lean upon the Lord and 
trust Him, and are humble and faith- 
ful, as all men can be, God always sus- 
tains and never deserts them. He 
cannot desert them. It is not possible 
that a man can fail if he does the will 
of God. No man ever did fail in this 
work and kingdom if he maintained 
his repentance and reformation — if 
these are kept good from the beginning 
to the finish, no man can fail. Where 
men do fail, it is because of their own 
faults and of their own weaknesses, 
and not the fault of the Father. And 
there is no fault or mistake of the 
Father in the choice that is made, 
and every man who is called to posi- 
tion in this Church is called by the 
Father, by revelation, and not other- 
wise. The mind and will of God is 
known on every occasion, and we need 
have no fear when the purposes of 
the Lord are announced. "When the 
design, the rule and the order of the 
Church are announced by the Prophet 
of God, know all Israel that God hath 
said it; and we know He hath spoken. 
We know when we hear his voice. We 
know His spirit, and we know the 
voice of the true shepherd. And this 
is my testimony to yon, my brethren 
and sisters, today, in regard to this 
great work. 

And I say these sacred precincts 
where the Prophets of God have 
dwelt and labored among us all 
these years, and where the inspiration 
of the Almighty comes as a flood, and 
where the will of God is an- 
nounced to all Israel, should be most 
dear to us. What a blessed privilege! 
O, if we appreciated it as we ought to 
do, this house would never hold the 
congregation on any occasion. We 
would be crowding the very grounds 
about it, as well as the galleries, and 
every spot would be filled, if we only 
appreciated that God is here, that the 
Holy Ghost is here and is with His 
servants. How great has been the op- 
portunity and privilege that is granted 



ELDER BRIG HAM YOUNG. 



to us, and how we ought to appreciate 
it, and how we ought to be humble, 
how we ought to repent and leave off 
every wickedness and evil and in- 
iquity, and how straight we should 
walk to the line, keeping the com- 
mandments of God, shunning not only 
evil but the appearance of evil! 

I quite endorse the remarks of 
Brother Smith in regard to the sacred- 
ness of the Sabbath day. That should 
always be observed. We cannot be 
too careful in regard to all these 
things, and everything, in fact, in life; 
and we want to be prepared, my 
brethren and sisters, for the coming of 
the Son of Man, for His coming is 
near; it approaches, and it will be up- 
on us before we know it, and before we 
are prepared. Let us then, I say, re- 
pent and make our repentance good 
from this time henceforth, and say 
nothing that would mortify us, or that 
would grieve the Spirit of the Lo»xL, or 
make us ashamed. 

I pray that the Lord will sustain us. 
I pray for President Woodruff, our 
great leader, the man whom God has 
honored with long life. How his life 
has been preserved! And we pray that 
he may continue to be preserved and 
stand at our head, and be filled with 
the power of God. And I pray for 
my brethren, the Presidency, the 
Twelve, and for the Elders of Israel, 
and for all who are in official positions 
among the people, at home and abroad. 
I pray for those who are laboring, who 
have responsibility upon their should- 
ers, all the brethren and all the sisters, 
that God will bless us, and enable us 
to do His will, accomplish His pur- 
poses, and be worthy of the trust that 
He has committed to us, that when we 
have finished, we shall be selected as 
His jewels, and that it may be said of 
us 'Well done, good and faithful 
servants, enter into the joy of thy 
Lord." Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG- 

God's work in other Worlds. What a Christian is — 
Sabbath observance— Preparation to meet the 
Savior. 

I am gratified to be here in this as- 
sembly today. The last Conference, 
in April, I was unable to attend, and 
I believe that I am a living monument 
of the mercy of God, for on two occa- 
sions in the month of April — last April 



— I thought my time had come. But 
the brethren who administered to me, 
under the influence and power of God, 
raised me up and through His mercies 
I have this privilege of meeting with 
the Saints in Conference today. 
Thank God for it. 

I am pleased and edified in the re- 
marks that have been made. I rejoice 
in the Gospel, for it is the power of 
God unto salvation to them that be- 
lieve, and I see a vast congregation be- 
fore me, the majority of whom have 
believed and have identified them- 
selves with the work of the latter 
days, which God has instituted to 
save His sons and daughters who 
have dwelt upon the earth, who do 
dwell upon the earth, and all who shall 
come upon the earth. This great work 
has to do with all the creations of 
God, and this movement is in harmony 
with other labors, that are going on 
in other planets, and we will find that 
instead of being isolated and strang- 
ers to them as we are now, we will 
mingle with people who are not of us 
today, people, possibly, of other plan- 
ets. And while we now consider that 
it is a great thing to become acquaint-' 
ed with the nations that dwell upon 
the earth, then it will be the pre- 
rogative of the saved to visit other 
creations and other organizations 
—planets that have come into 
existence and are peopled by the 
Almighty— that^ we may visit them 
and become acquainted with them as 
we now become acquainted with for- 
eign people.This work extends to all the 
people. This work extends to all the 
creations of God. It partakes of God, 
and therefore the attributes that are 
planted in man are like unto His at- 
tributes, and we shall become ac- 
quainted and see as we are seen and 
know as we are known. 

I am thankful that the brethren 
have touched upon our weaknesses. 
We claim to be Christians. What is a 
Christian? It is one who does the will 
of the Father, that lives in obedience 
to the commandments of Christ. If I 
do not these things, I am not a 
Christian. Men have asked me by 
what power does a certain individual 
heal the sick? Is it in the name of 
Jesus? "O, no." Question the indi- 
vidual who is operating, and he may

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tell you, "I know not by what power 
I do this." Then I don't want any- 
thing to do with that power. When 
one who is endowed with the Priest- 
hood and the Spirit of God pro- 
nounces a blessing in the name of 
Jesus Christ, that man is acting as a 
Christian, in that respect at least. 
When there is any religious denomina- 
tion that labor, that worship in any 
other name, they are not Christians; 
and I leave it to you and to the world 
to define who are Christians in this 
generation. I do not want to malign 
airy one, but, my brethren and sisters, 
I take this as a key, and no man nor 
woman need stumble when the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ are 
taught and they are lived up to, — 
that man or that woman who so lives 
is a Christian in the true sense of the 
word. If a religious denomination 
claim to have revelation and institute 
a doctrine and eschew Christ and put 
Him away, they are simply grafting 
on to this enlightened age a system of 
heathenism, and it will not be long be- 
for they will erect their heathen gods, 
as has been done in other ages of the 
world. However they may look upon 
it, it is true. If these people are 
Christians, if these men and these wo- 
men are Christians, then they will do 
that which Christ has commanded. 

I am a witness that He has com- 
manded us to observe the Sabbath day 
and keep it holy; and I will say this, 
that there is not, in some respects, 
observed in this city anything like the 
order that I found in Carthage on a 
visit to that place some years ago; 
that is the spot where the Prophet 
Joseph and the Patriarch Hyrum 
were murdered in cold blood. You 
could not buy a drop of liquor in that 
town. You saw no ragged loafers, 
nor fences down, nor men wandering 
about the streets, but everybody was 
busy, everybody seemed to have some- 
thing to do. I was astonished, because 
I had always looked upon that town 
as the worst in the United States. 
But it was ahead of this city in 
Zion, in the order that was main- 
tained there. There is nothing in a 
name. It is said by one of the poets, 
"What's in a name?" I may bear the 
name of a Latter-day Saint, but I 
will tell you that I have not the 



flavor nor the odor of a Saint when I 
do not the will of the Father. It is 
said that "a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet." But when I 
do not live the religion of Jesus 
Christ, I have not the confidence to 
present to the people, nor the Spirit of 
God in me to be witnessed by the con- 
gregations of the Latter-day Saints, 
and I cannot deceive them, it is im- 
possible. No man can deceive this 
people. He cannot do it, because 
they are so strongly entrenched, every 
man and woman that is living his or 
her religion. First, we have the 
Presidency of the Church to give us 
revelation, to instruct us, and if God 
our Father has anything for us to do 
particularly outside of the instruc- 
tions already given, it comes through 
that channel. It comes through His 
mouthpiece, and it is passed from one 
grade to another in the Priesthood. 
And it comes to us, "Thus saith the 
Lord," if need be. Then we have with- 
in ourselves that living light and in- 
telligence, that when the word of the 
Lord comes, it seems like waters com- 
ing together, pure and undented, 
waters that blend together and are 
undistinguishable when they meet and 
are mingled. That spirit is absorbed 
by us, and we feel that what is given 
unto us is for the consolation of our 
souls. 

Now, I ought to receive whatever 
God sends me. It is a very hard 
job sometimes. If it doesn't agree 
with me, it is because I am cross- 
grained. But we should learn this 
lesson, that God will hold us responsi- 
ble, because the means, as has been 
said, are in our power by which we 
can walk a straight line without de- 
viation. Although we have weak- 
nesses, yet we can walk the straight 
line back into the presence of our 
Father. He has given us this power, 
and He holds us responsible for its 
use, just as the ten talents were 
given, and those who had them 
were held responsible for their 
use. God holds you and 
me responsible for the talents he gives 
us, or has given us, and if these talents 
are allowed to lie in the ground un- 
productive, we may pray to Him but 
it will be in vain, comparatively, for 
there will be nothing for us by way

of reward. But when they are im- 
proved, we develop until we become 
like God, for the attributes which He 
has implanted within us are godlike 
in every particular. If we do these 
things, Latter-day Saints, God will ap- 
prove of us. 

Now, why not go to from this time 
forth and say in our hearts, and put 
it into active life, that we, as far as we 
are individually concerned, will ob- 
serve the Sabbath day and keep it 
holy, and so far as we have influence 
over our families, that we will see that 
this is the case also with them. Why 
not do this? If this one thing were 
done it would be a great relief to the 
Latter-day Saints. We complain of 
hard times. Why? Because, as it 
was said this morning by the first 
speaker, so many of us are laboring for 
money, not for Christ and his Church. 
If we had labored and considered 
"first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness," all things would be 
added. This is true, or else we have 
been misled. I believe it to be true, 
to be the revelation of God. Are all 
things added to us? Well, there are 
a great many things that I wish had 
never been added; but I believe "all 
things" meant all good things, and we 
have seemed to have a great many 
very bad things added to us in this 
community and throughout the State. 
Then that is positive evidence that we 
have not obeyed the injunction laid 
upon us to seek first the kingdom of 
God and His righteousness, and all 
things would be added to us. I do not 
believe this day that there would be 
one soul wanting labor, wanting em- 
ployment, not one soul needing food, 
shelter or clothing, if we had sought 
first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness. All would have been 
provided for. I believe that these 
things have come upon us through our 
weaknesses. That is my belief. I 
believe I suffer today through debt, 
suffer in my feelings today in not be- 
ing able to meet my obligations 
promptly, because I have not sought 
the kingdom of God and His righteous- 
ness, first and foremost. Now I 
believe that the Lord will help 
us out if we will from this 
time forth begin to observe the Sab- 



bath day, and if we will go to our sac- 
rament meetings and partake of that 
sacrament worthily; if we will attend 
to our prayers; if we will know where 
our children are after dark, and where 
they are in daylight, our sons and our 
daughters; if we do not allow them to 
form into clubs, and go riding horse- 
back, in carriages, wagons and bug- 
gies, on bicycles or on foot, wandering 
up the canyon, wandering into the 
hills, or off somewhere playing cards, 
or doing something of this kind. If we 
will watch them, God wil watch us 
and give us power; if we do not watch 
them, He will not take much notice of 
any of us, I am afraid. He has given us 
these things as duties. It is our place 
to attend to them. I do not blame the 
children so much aa I blame the older 
ones, because the child may be led. 

We have influences to contend with 
here that are inimical to the Church of 
Christ. A lady stopped me on the street 
the other day, that is she looked like 
a lady and I think she was. She said, 
"O, I can't stand your endowments." 
"Why, what do you know about our 
endowments?" I said. "O, the wick- 
edness! I see you have been indus- 
trious, but O how wicked! O, that en- 
dowment house, what a terror it has 
been to me! I am not very old, but 
I have heard of it all my life!" She 
was a lady from the East. Well, I 
talked with her a little while. She 
asked me if I was a Mormon. I told 
her, just as Brother Joseph P. said on 
one occasion when a boy and a 
stranger interrogated him, "Yes, I am 
a Mormon and died in the wool." 

Well, now, brethren and sisters, 
here are our duties. O, I wish I could 
bring them home to you and to me. 
I want to be preached to just as much 
as anybody. I am one with you, as 
you can see, so far as debt is con- 
cerned. O, I am bound to go right 
along with you. I wish I could tell 
you how I view my own actions. I 
haven't language to do it. I would 
like to tell you how I view those who 
break the Sabbath day, how I look 
upon those who go out to pleasure 
resorts upon the Sabbath day. I do 
not care how much people ride in a 
carriage if they are doing the will of 
the Father, if they are going to their 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



meetings, if they are going to perform 
some duty; but when we start out on 
Sunday and slash and race, I think we 
are breaking the Sabbath day. 

Brethren and sisters, God has com- 
manded us to listen to the voice of in- 
spiration from our brethren that we 
have heard this day, especially to 
the voice of our leader. Listen to 
him. His words are to me like "apples 
of gold in pictures of silver." Every 
word that falls from his mouth, the 
simplest word that he utters, is to me 
a revelation, although his words may 
not be quick and powerful; but every 
word that he utters in conversation 
is revelation to me, fori look upon him 
as the vicegerent of God upon the 
earth. Listen to him. Listen to his 
counsels and to the counsels of his 
brethren, and let this Conference mark 
the epoch of a reformation, mark 
the beginning of a reformation in the 
midst of this people. Let us go from 
this Conference when it is ended with a 
determination in our hearts that as for 
us we will serve God with our house- 
holds as near as possible. This is the 
resolution that is wanted. This is 
what is needed in the hearts of the 
people. And let us be diligent day and 
night,diligent in keeping the command- 
ments of God, for what was said here 
7. know to be true, that the coming 
of our Lord and Master is not 
far away from us. It will surprise us 
very much, when the cry goes forth, 
"Lo, the bridegroom cometh, go ye 
out to meet him." I for one want to 
live so that when that cry is sounded 
it will be the most joyous message that 
ever saluted the ears of a human be- 
ing. That is the way I want to live, 
and I would like the people of the 
whole world — not only the Latter-day 
Saints, but the people of the whole 
earth, to live so that when that cry 
goes forth we may go out to meet Him 
with our countenances elevated to our 
Savior, beaming with joy and glad- 
ness, to meet the Redeemer, the re- 
warder of the acts that we have per- 
formed. God help us in this; God 
give us strength, for we are weak, 
and enable us to lift ourselves above 
our surroundings, above the world, and 
to set an example worthy of imitation 
by all men; which is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRE ST. WILFORD kWOODRUFF 

The Written Word— Joseph and Brlgham In Klrt- 
land — Present Inspiration. 

There are a few moments I would 
like to spend in talking upon one par- 
ticular point that has been spoken 
about today. Brother Brigham has re- 
ferred to it, and our brethren this fore- 
noon alluded to it. It is in regard to 
the written word of God and the living 
oracles. Perhaps you may think that 
Brother Woodruff is hardly a suitable 
man to speak upon this subject, seeing 
he is President of the Church, but I 
think you will find I am when I get 
through. I will refer to a certain 
meeting I attended in the town of 
Kirtland in my early days. At that 
meeting some remarks were made that 
have been made here today, with re- 
gard to the living oracles and with re- 
gard to the written word of God. The 
same principle was presented, al- 
though not as extensively as it has 
been here, when a leading man in the 
Church got up and talked upon the 
subject, and said: "You have got the 
word of God before you here in the 
Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine 
and Covenants; you have the written 
word of God, and you who give reve- 
lations should give revelations accord- 
ing to those books, as what is written 
in those books is the word of God. "We 
should confine ourselves to them." 
When he concluded, Brother Joseph 
turned to Brother Brigham Young and 
said, "Brother Brigham I want you 
to take the stand and tell us your 
views with regard to the written 
oracles and the written word of God." 
Brother Brigham took the stand, and 
he took the Bible, and laid it down; 
he took the Book of Mormon, and laid 
it down; and he took the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants, and laid it down 
before him, and he said: "There 
is the written word of God 
to us, concerning the work 
of God from the beginning of the 
world, almost, to our day." "And now," 
said he, "when compared with the 
living oracles those books are nothing 
to me; those books do not convey the 
word of God direct to us now, as do 
the words of a Prophet or a man bear- 
ing the Holy Priesthood in our day and 
generation. I would rather have the 
living oracles than all the

writing in the books." That 
was the course he pursued. When 
he was through, Brother Joseph 
said to the congregation: "Brother 
Brigham has told you the word 
of the Lord, and he has told you 
the truth." 

And now, I wanted to speak a word 
Apostle or leading man of the Church 
upon this subject. Whenever the Lord 
requires any Prophet, Seer, Revelator, 
to speak, the Spirit of the Lord is with 
him to give counsel to the people from 
time to time as he is moved upon, and 
such as the people ought to hear. But 
I want you to understand this one 
thing; the Holy Priesthood and power 
of God do not stop there; it does not 
stop with the Presidency, it does not 
stop with the Twelve Apostles, it does 
not stop with our leading men of 
Israel ; — there is not a man on God's 
footstool that is sent forth into the 
world to preach the Gospel but ought 
to have the Spirit of the Lord upon 
him and the revelation of God to 
him. And by that power these valleys 
of the mountains have been filled with 
the inhabitants of the world today; 
by that power this Tabernacle has 
been built; by that power have the; 
Elders, from the organization of this 
Church until today, performed their 
work. There is no end to the Holy 
Ghost and the power of God and the 
revelations of God to man. This is our 
position today before the world. Every 
man should have the Holy Priesthood 
with him, of some kind or other, when 
he goes to preach the Gospel; he 
should occupy some position of that 
kind. The Holy Ghost should be with 
that man. The Holy Ghost is with that 
man, revelation is with that man, if he 
lives his religion and does his 
duty before God. 

I have before me the Twelve 



Apostles who were boys — who were 
young men when they were thrust into 
the vineyard — in their boyhood, as it 
were, when they went forth to the 
islands of the sea and the nations of 
the earth, and they have done that 
work in their young days by the in- 
spiration and the power of God, and 
He will be with them until the end. 
We should all understand this. The 
Bible is all right, the Book of Mormon 
is all right, the Doctrine and Covenants 
is all right, and they proclaim the 
work of God and the word of God in> 
the earth in this day and generation: 
until the coming of the Son of Man; 
but the Holy Priesthood is not con« 
fined particularly to those books, that 
is, it did not cease when those books 
were made. It belongs to every man 
that goes forth into the world, and these 
are our principles, and these are our 
rights, and these are our duties, and 
these are our gifts. The Holy Ghost is 
not confined to any one man, but every 
one should have it. As the Lord said 
to Orson Hyde and the brethren with 
him, that were going to preach the 
Gospel; "Go forth and speak as you 
are moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
and when you speak as you are moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, that is the 
word of the Lord, that is the mind of 
the Lord, that is His Spirit, that is 
the power of God unto salvation to 
everyone that believes." 

Well, I felt I wanted to name this 
in this connection. This subject has 
been brought up so strongly here to- 
day, I felt I wanted to bear my testi- 
mony of these things. God bless you. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem,

ELDER FRANKLIN D- RICHARDS 

Books cannot give Authority nor administer Ord. 
nances — The Gospel is a practical System — No 
Keligion but Christ's reveals the Resurrection — 
The Christian Sabbath and its Importance — The 
only true Gospel and Priesthood. 

In arising to address this vast con- 
gregation, I earnestly desire a contin- 
uation of that liberality of spirit which 
was enjoyed yesterday by those 
whose privilege it was to minister unto 
us, realizing that without it we shall 
not be edified in the truth and the 
knowledge of God. In arising to speak 
upon and testify of the work of God, 
it is desirable to know what to speak 
about as well as what to say about it. 
Yesterday I felt peculiar pleasure 
and joy of spirit in listening to the 
testimonies of the brethren, because 
of the simplicity and force of many of 
the truths that were uttered. One of 
them came forcibly to my mind, as 
well as to the rest of the hearers, con- 
cerning the value and importance of 
the living oracles to the Church of 
God on the earth as being the princi- 
ple of precedence in the midst of God's 
people over written instructions that 
are given by men. Inasmuch as the 
Elders speak by the Holy Spirit, the 
word of the Lord is that their instruc- 
tions should be scripture — "shall be 
the will of the Lord, shall be the mind 
of the Lord, shall be the word of the 
Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord 
and the power of God unto salvation." 
When the declaration was made con- 
cerning the Bible, the Book of Mor- 
mon, the Doctrine and Covenants 
how deficient they would be in ad- 
ministering salvation, if they alone 



were enjoyed by the people. Now we 
know just how it has worked with all 
Christendom, to have the Bible with- 
out having authority to administer 
the ordinances mentioned in it. Now we 
may possess either of these books, 01 
all of them, and they can not baptize 
a single man, or woman, into the 
Church. There is not power enough in 
all the books to do it, nor is there 
power in all the books to give any man 
authority to do it. Consequently, then, 
it requires the authority from the Lord 
to be present to administer in all His 
ordinances. The highest authority 
that we have known — the Lord Jesus 
Christ Himself, stated, that it was not 
possible without the birth of the water 
and of the spirit to enter the kingdom 
of heaven. Said He to the learned 
Nicodemus, "Except a man be born 
of the water and of the spirit he can- 
not enter into the kingdom of God." 
That was a declaration of principle 
that was inexorable. He who created 
this earth and causes it to travel 
round the sun every three hundred and 
sixty-five days and six hours, estab- 
lished those great eternal principles 
that rule the heavens, also the law that 
except a man be born of the water 
and of the spirit he cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God; and one is just 
as much a law of nature as the other. 
The latter is the law of nature and of 
grace to man. Who could administer 
these ordinances except they received 
the authority from God to do it? These 
books can neither baptize, nor confirm 
us. They cannot confirm upon us the 
Holy Ghost nor a membership in the 
Church of Christ, neither can they ad- 
minister to us any other of the ordi- 
nances which we are receiving, and 
in which we rejoice so much, in the 
house of our God. It requires nothing 
less than a present living minister in 
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to 
administer in all the ordinances, in 
counsel, and in directing all the affairs 
of the Church of Christ. We have 
learned this, and understand it, or else 
we do not know where our safety 
lies. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a sys- 



ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 



25 



tern of things which, in order to be 
known and understood, must be lived. 
A man cannot preach with effect and 
power to another the forgiveness of 
sins through faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, or baptism for the remission 
of his sins, unless he has himself been 
baptized for the remission of his sins 
and has faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 
himself. No man can administer in 
the ordinances of the Gospel of Christ 
with effect and with power, unless he 
has first been made partaker of them 
himself; and that is how we cannot, 
any of us, preach the power of the 
resurrection, because none of us have 
been raised from the dead. When, 
by and by, the time of the resurrec- 
tion comes, men will teach it to us 
who have been raised from the dead, 
and who understand and have the 
power of it and the keys of it. That 
is why you cannot be baptized for your 
dead in the house of the Lord, until 
you have been first baptized and re- 
ceived ordinances yourself. The Gos- 
pel has to be lived in order to be 
realized and its power received. The 
man who goes forward with real re- 
pentance of heart for all his sins and 
covenants with God that he will serve 
Him the rest of his days, according to 
the best of his ability, with the grace 
of God bestowed upon him, and goes 
forward and receives this ordinance, 
rejoices in this Gospel; because this 
is the first step in it, and when a man 
does this with full purpose of heart 
and enters upon keeping the com- 
mandments of God he receives the 
Holy Spirit. The promise made to 
him is true, and is fulfilled, and every- 
body under the sound of my voice 
that has ever pursued that course 
knows that it is true. They know 
that in entering into the service and 
keeping the commandments of God 
they receive the Holy Spirit, when ad- 
ministered to by those who are au- 
thorized of God; and it gives to one 
the gift of tongues, to talk in a lan- 
guage that he does not know himself. 
That same spirit gives to another the 
gift of interpretation of what the first 
has been talking about, to the edifica- 
tion of all who have listened. It gives 
to another the gift of healing, that if 
he is sick, afflicted and distressed, 
and is living his religion, he can call 
upon the Elders, receive their bless- 



ing and be healed. If he is a minister, 
of the Lord himself, and labors to re- 
ceive it, he will have the gift to admin- 
ister the anointing to others, and 
they will be healed; or he may receive 
the gift of prophecy, of faith, of wis- 
dom, of visions, of dreams, or to hear 
the still small voice of the Holy 
Spirit giving inspiration to his soul. It 
requires a man to live in the continual 
state of humility and obedience to- 
wards God, of repentance for every 
imperfection, folly and vanity, and 
an effort to depart therefrom, and to 
sanctify himself by the working of the 
Spirit and the belief of the truth unto 
everlasting life. This Gospel brings 
with it the gifts, the blessings and 
the grace of God, so that the faithful 
Saint, as he goes along in the straight 
and narrow path, knows of the good- 
ness of God, that he is in fellowship 
with the Lord; that he is not alone 
and without God in the world, but that 
the angels are about him, and the care 
of the Lord is over him. 

Well, now, we have a Gospel that is 
full of joy and consolation. It opens 
up principles of intelligence, and revel- 
ation, of the knowledge of things past 
and present and to come. There are 
a great many other religions in the 
world, and some very powerful ones. 
For instance, there is the Mohamme- 
dan religion, and those people have a 
faith of their own, and they aire very 
numerous, about 175,000,000, they esti- 
mate, I believe. They have their 
prophet, they have their faith, they 
have their ideas of futurity, and they 
are a sort of cousin in the relation 
to father Abraham's family. His son, 
Ishmael, and Isaac's son, Esau, in 
their seed, constitute a great portion 
of that class of people. They have had 
apostles raised up among them, from 
the seed of Abraham as they say, 
and they entertain a certain amount 
of faith. In fact, the promise of the 
Lord, wherein he said he knew Abra- 
ham, that he would command his chil- 
dren after him, is manifest in that 
people, in that they believe in one God, 
and they claim one prophet, Moham- 
med. Then, again, we look to the 
eastern world, in China, for instance, 
where are said to be about four hun- 
dred millions of human beings, and 
they believe in doctrines given them 
by Confucius and by Buddhah, and 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



others. But those four hundred mil- 
lions are given up to the worship of 
idols. They are idolaters, with the 
rest; and so we may go on over the 
world, and find scores of these great 
branches of religion that have had 
their heads and chiefs, their faiths 
and beliefs. What I want to call your 
special attention to in this connection, 
is this: Has any one of them ever had 
a man of their number pass through 
death, rise again from the grave and 
declare to them the principles of hav- 
ing obtained through him or by him, a 
resurrection — been lifted up to im- 
mortality through their faith? "We do 
not find it in history anywhere in the 
earth that they have ever had such a 
testimony or evidence of a resurrec- 
tion and immortality beyond the 
grave. All that they have given to 
them is the exercise of a certain faith 
that lasts them through this life. But 
the Gospel of the Latter-day Saints, 
which is the Gospel of the former 
day Saints, as well, is different from any 
believed in by any other people as to 
all these things, and people who be- 
lieve in the real Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
the Gospel that He instituted, have 
something more and better and beyond 
what any other portion of the human 
family have to look to. 

The great Captain of our salvation 
went into the grave with marks in His 
hands and in His feet and in His side, 
and He came forth out of that grave 
in three days, and He did not go away 
without being seen. He made Himself 
known, communicated with them, as- 
sociated with them, in fact, and gave 
them a certain knowledge of the truth 
of the sayings he uttered Himself to 
Moses a good many years before, on 
the mountain. He said to Moses: 
"This is My work and My glory, to 
bring to pass the immortality and eter- 
nal life of man." This is His great 
work. The human family had, through 
transgression, come under the law of 
sin and death, and He had come to 
restore that which was lost, and to 
bring to pass the resurrection, to 
open the prison doors to the spirits in 
prison, them that were bound, and 
declared the acceptable day of the 
Lord, and bestowed gifts to men. This 
is the kind of a Captain of our salva- 
tion that we have, one who has re- 



vealed this knowledge. Said He, "As 
the Father hath power in Himself to 
lay down His life and take it again, 
so hath He given unto the Son power 
to lay down His life and to take it 
again," and He did so. Now where 
is there another among those strange 
religions that do not believe in the 
Lord Jesus Christ as their Redeemer 
that entertain any such knowledge 
and understanding of eternal life and 
of the resurrection of the dead? That 
He has obtained these, we have abun- 
dant testimony. Stephen said he saw 
Him sitting at the right hand of God, 
while he, Stephen, was being perse- 
cuted and stoned to death; and Paul 
said he had seen and heard things not 
lawful for a man to utter. And the 
Savior, after He had done those won- 
derful works in His own land, came 
over here to America, and there was 
here no chance for deception, because 
He showed them the wounds in His 
hands and in His feet. He was the 
same person that went down into the 
grave and came out triumphant over 
the grave. Now, if any of these other 
religions have had any man that has 
gone through the grave and risen 
again, they certainly have been very 
lacking in kindness not to come and 
show their fellow worshippers of that 
knowledge and that power and that 
great attainment. But the Lord Jesus 
has shown unto the Saints composing 
His Church in the different parts of the 
world, the gifts and blessings of im- 
mortality and eternal life which He 
came and brought to light. The Apos- 
tles understood the same thing. 
Paul, in writing to Timothy, says 
that "life and immortality is brought 
to light through the Gospel." So then, 
we have the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ as something that endures be- 
yond the grave, while the 
knowledge that the rest of 
the human family possesses 
only leads them to the grave, and be- 
yond that is to them dark- 
ness and ignorance, and they know 
nothing about the future, comparative- 
ly speaking. 

Jesus came and taught the people 
upon this land; He came here and 
ministered repeatedly. The Book of 
Mormon tells us that He came oft, 
and broke bread with the Saints here.

and instructed them and testified to 
them; on one occasion He came and 
told them to gather together their sick, 
afflicted and distressed, and bring 
them before Him and He healed them. 
He made a business of it, as Joseph 
Smith went through the land of Nau- 
voo or Commerce and Montrose heal- 
ing every one who was sick, of the 
people of God, and as the Savior 
wished to do in the land of Palestine. 
There He complained that He could 
not do many mighty works because 
of their unbelief; but here 
on the land of America, He found 
a greater measure of faith. He 
called together the people and healed 
their sick and distressed. On 
another occasion He blessed their little 
ones, and those little ones spoke and 
uttered things incomprehensible to 
mortals, and angels came down and 
surrounded them, and ministered unto 
them. And while the Savior Himself 
began with a degree of fearfulness 
concerning their unbelief, before He got 
through He said: "Now My joy is 
full." Yes, this great Redeemer, the 
author of life and immortality, came 
over to this land and labored among 
the Nephites, and said here, what we 
have no account of His saying «in 
that other land, at any time: "Now, 
My joy is full." On the contrary, on 
the other land, He sorrowed and He 
wept because of their unbelief and 
their hardness of heart, and He couldn't 
do many mighty miracles among 
them because of their unbelief. Thus 
we have a Savior that has gone 
through the grave, a Redeemer that has 
triumphed victoriously over hell, and 
the grave; and it is said the last enemy 
that shall be destroyed will be death. 

We see, then, that the Latter-day 
Saints have not only the advantages 
of the Holy Ghost here, and the power 
of faith; but O, the love that fills our 
hearts when we hear the pure princi- 
ples of the Gospel taught to us! How 
happy we have felt as we sat to- 
gether while the Apostles ministered 
unto us the bread of life. How joyful 
the people feel when they are full of 
love to each other. The principle of 
charity and the blessedness of the 
Everlasting Gospel belong to this peo- 
ple as it belongs to no other people. 

I rejoice greatly in this Gospel, be- 



cause it opens up unto us transcend- 
ant joys, blessings and glories in the 
future, which we have knowledge of, 
which our Savior taught, and which 
are taught to us here in our times, 
and which He has condescended to 
reveal again in these last days. 
Think of what this Savior has done 
for us here, and has gone to the 
Father to intercede for us, to forgive 
us of our sins, to heal us of our back- 
slidings; and has condescended, after 
the lapse of eighteen hundred years, 
to come with His Father, the glori- 
ous Father. The Creator of all came 
and introduced that Savior, His Son, 
to the boy Joseph Smith, when four- 
teen years of age, and taught him to 
commence a great and mighty work, 
of which we are today some few of 
the fruits. The Father said, "This is 
my beloved Son, hear him." And the 
Son taught Joseph, and sent His angels 
to administer to him, to teach, to bless, 
to bring forth the Book of Mormon, 
and to build up the Church again, 
bringing it forth out of the wilderness 
through great suffering; and we ought 
not to forget that the truth is a costly 
article, and always has been. It has 
cost the best men that have ever lived 
in the flesh, their mortal lives, and 
may yet again. It is a work that is 
made altogether of what has been 
considered as sacrifice. Indeed, the old 
Prophet said, "Gather together my 
Saints, unto me, they that have made 
a covenant with me by sacrifice." 
That is the principle upon which we 
are brought together. We sacrifice 
our sins, our pleasant enjoyments and 
worldly lusts, and turn unto God and 
serve Him. 

This Sabbath day may become a very 
grave question if we are to build up 
the New Jerusalem. It was one of the 
first things that the Lord complained 
of through the prophets anciently, 
that they had polluted His Sabbath, 
and they had profaned it, and they 
had not observed it: and when they 
got so they could do these things with 
impunity, they left off paying their 
tithing, and the Lord told them they 
had robbed God, the whole nation of 
them — they had robbed Him because 
they had withheld the tithing which 
they owed Him. And when they 
could do a few of these things, they

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



went on in their transgressions into 
fornications, adulteries and murder, 
from one step to another, to the most 
heinous crimes, until, finally, they 
could crucify the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We must look out that we do not roll 
any manner of sin as a sweet morsel 
under our tongue, but strive with pen- 
itence day by day to put away from 
us everything that is contrary to god- 
liness, that would hinder the working 
of the Spirit within us, that we may 
be able to get grace for grace, and go 
from faith to faith, until we can be- 
come pure in heart, for we are assured 
in the word of the Lord that nothing 
that is unholy or impure can enter 
into His presence. What a saying! 
No wonder the brethren said to Him, 
"Lord, are there any that shall be 
saved?" when we look at the touch- 
stone, look at the criterion, look at the 
rule by which these things have to 
be brought about. And we should la- 
bor continually, striving to subdue 
ourselves and to put away the vices, 
the sins and the besetments that do 
so daily and so easily beset us, until 
we bring this living body of clay into 
the subjection of the Spirit, that our 
souls may live. 

The Sabbath is the day that the 
Lord has appointed for a time of 
rest. He says that H^ fin- 
ished His work, and that He rested 
on the Sabbath day, the seventh day. 
When the Lord came, in His day, He 
instituted the first day of the week, 
and ever since then it has been "His 
day," and He says, that we may keep 
ourselves unspotted from the world, 
we are required to meet together on 
His day and offer our sacraments, and 
make our acknowledgements, and our 
confessions, paying our devotions to 
the Most Hiarh. It is a common thing 
for the people to violate that sacred 
law concerning the Sabbath day. 
Many of the people, if they go on a 
journey, take pains in their calcula- 
tion to make the Sabbath count 
one day in the trip; and many things 
are put off for Sunday especially. I 
would like to have it taken up with the 
people, and have the women make cal- 
culations on Saturday, and have the 
food cooked on that day, for the Sun- 
day, and then go to meeting, in- 
stead of roasting over the stove cook- 



ing, and see to having a little more 
leisure and good instruction, and feed 
the soul, instead of being so much at 
work and having so much to do on 
that day. The Lord said to Israel: 
"Six days shalt thou labor and do all 
thy work, for on the seventh day, the 
Lord thy God rested from His labors; 
and thou shalt not do any work.neither 
thy son nor thy daughter,nor thy man- 
servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy 
cattle, nor the stranger that is within 
thy gates." Now it was a strict rule 
and law and commandment to Israel 
anciently, and you will find if you will 
look into the Book of Mormon that it 
was so there, and is going to become 
just as binding upon God's people in all 
time as it ever was with them, and we 
ought to be looking to it and practic- 
ing on it, so that we can do right, so 
as to be able to do the right thing 
when we get to it. 

I testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that this Gospel is the Gospel 
of all others on the earth, the only one 
that is worthy the attention of mortals, 
as fast as it can be brought to their 
consideration. And as we haVe been 
blessed to learn these principles and 
to know them, and to know of the 
things of the future, and to know of 
some things of the past, we have reas- 
on to rejoice above all other people, 
and we have reason to deny ourselves 
of all unrighteousness just as fast as 
we can, and to learn the way of life 
and to hearken to the counsels of those 
that are called of God and to walk in 
His ways, and to receive continually 
the word of the Lord and His direction 
in all our affairs. I rejoice greatly in 
the work of the Lord, and I pray that 
His blessings may abound unto the 
people, that He may incline our hearts 
to keep His laws, to walk in His ways, 
for the law of the Lord is perfect, con- 
verting the soul. The testimonies of 
the Lord are sure, and they even 
make wise the simple. 

Now a word about the Priesthood 
and its restoration: Think of it! 
This same Lord and Savior, Jesus 
Christ, ordained Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery Apostles by Peter, 
James and John, His servants. Joseph 
and Oliver having received this 
apostleship, confirmed it upon twelve 
brethren of the Church, and those

29 



brethren have conferred it upon us 
who are in the stand today; thus some 
of us received this holy apostleship but 
the fourth in succession from Jesus 
Christ. And the fact is that the 
Priesthood has come down to us as the 
Lord promised when He said He would 
be with His Apostles always "even 
unto the end of the world." And He 
says to us concerning Peter, James 
and John: "Whom I have sent unto 
you, by whom I have ordained you 
and confirmed you to be Apostles, and 
especial witnesses of my name, and 
bear the keys of your ministry, and of 
the same things which I reveal unto 
them; unto whom I have committed 
the keys of My kingdom, and a dis- 
pensation of the Gospel for the last 
days and for the last times; and for 
the dispensation of the fullness of times 
in the which I will gather together in 
one all things both which are in heaven 
and which are on earth." These are 
the men that have received this Priest- 
hood — these that sit around me this 
morning. It was received from those 
resurrected men that have come to la- 
bor with us. This is the Priesthood 
by which we officiate, and it is not 
something that has come down through 
the ages and been lost. This is the 
Priesthood that was taken away into 
the wilderness anciently, and has been 
restored in these latter-days in its 
purity, in its simplicity and its power, 
And those who give themselves to it 
fully and faithfully in all humility, re- 
ceiving the instructions and counsels 
of those holding that Priesthood, should 
be worthy of all acceptation, and we 
ought to realize it and avail ourselves 
of the benefit of it, and be found in 
no case speaking against each other 
or the Lord's anointed. 

May the Lord give us His Spirit, in- 
tensify it in us, in our hearts, and train 
us in the principles of righteousness 
and truth, and help and inspire us in 
every good word and work, and then 
He will do better for us than we know 
how to ask or even to think. Amen. 

ELDER LORENZO SNOW.

Brethren and sisters and friends, I 
hope during the short time that I ad- 
dress you this morning I may have the 



benefit of your prayers, and the ex- 
ercise of your faith. 

At these general Conferences it is 
the privilege of everyone who attends 
to receive instruction, suited to his in- 
dividual needs and benefits, of great 
worth, and if we pay proper attention 
to what is said and exercise the proper 
faith, there will be no disappo'utment. 

Now, I wish to read a few verses 
from the Doctrine and Covenants, 
Section 110, which describes one of the 
most important events of our day. 

"The veil was taken from our minds, 
and the eyes of our understanding 
were opened. We saw the Lord stand- 
ing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, 
before us, and under His feet was a 
paved work of pure gold, in color like 
amber. His eyes were as a flame of 
fire, and the hair of his head was 
white like the pure snow. His counte- 
nance shone above the brightness of 
the sun, and His voice was as the 
sound of the rushing of great waters, 
even the voice of Jehovah, saying: I 
am the first and the last, 
1 am He who liveth. I am 
He who was slain, I am your ad- 
vocate with the Father. Behold your 
sins are forgiven you, you are clean 
before me, therefore lift up your heads 
and rejoice. Let the hearts of your 
brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of 
all my people rejoice, who have, with 
their might, built this house to my 
name. For behold, I have accepted 
this house, and my name shall be here, 
and I will manifest myself to my peo- 
ple in mercy in this house, yea, I will 
appear unto my servants, and speak 
unto them with mine own voice, if 
my people will keep my command- 
ments, and do not pollute this holy 
house. Tea, the hearts of thousands 
and tens of thousands shall greatly 
rejoice in consequence of the bless- 
ings which shall be poured out, and 
the endowment with which my ser- 
vants have been endowed in this 
house; and the fame of this house 
shall spread to foreign lands, and this 
is the beginning of the blessing which 
shall be poured upon the heads of my 
people. Even so. Amen." 

We have heard, brethren and sisters, 
very excellent principles, explained to 
us yesterday, and this morning by 
Apostle Richards, and our hearts have 
been made to rejoice in the contem- 
plation of the positions that we oc- 
cupy, of the prospects that are before 
us, and of the glorious records that 
many, and I hope all, have made in 
the past. It is strange, that there are 
so few that have come to an under- 
standing that God has revealed Him-

self unto His people, that His voice 
has been heard, as I have just read to 
you.and for what He has accomplished 
through the Holy Priesthood that He 
has caused to be conferred upon many 
of His servants. Thirteen hundred or 
thereabouts of the servants of God are 
now traveling through the world as 
oracles of God and testifying of these 
most extraordinary facts, and are 
promising in the name of the Al- 
mighty, by virtue of the divine au- 
thority they possess, that those who 
will obey the Gospel which they are 
authorized to administer, shall re- 
ceive a knowledge of these important 
truths. It is a marvelous fact that 
there are thirteen hundred men who 
are now promising in the name of the 
Lord and explaining how every per- 
son may know, and know effectually, 
know by revelation, that their promises 
are of the Almighty, that they have 
authority to thus prophesy, prophesy 
of that which is most important; in 
fact, there could be nothing of 
greater importance to mortal man 
than that which pertains to their 
prophecy, and all men have a 
right or the privilege of ascertaining, 
in a very simple way, whether that 
prediction is from God. 

This is indeed strange and wonder- 
ful. Jt is strange and wonderful to 
the world because such things have 
never been heard of or known for cen- 
turies. What is their prediction that 
is of such high importance to all peo- 
ple? Why, this: Having stated be- 
fore the cangregations of the world 
that they are authorized to preach 
the Gospel of life and salvation, that 
they are authorized to promise the 
gift of the Holy Ghost, that shall lead 
into all truth and show things to come, 
and shall testify in reference to their 
authority, then to make this predic- 
tion that such as will obey the simple 
principles of the Gospel, shall receive 
a perfect knowledge, a knowl- 
edge not by the reading of 
books, the Scriptures or any 
past revelations that may have been 
given, but they shall receive a knowl- 
edge of this from God Himself. Well 
now, all that is required of these in- 
dividuals to know that which pertains 
to their salvation, exaltation and glory 
i-- simply to do that which has been 



made plain, very plain indeed by 
Jesus Christ and by. the Apostles, as 
contained in the Scriptures of truth; 
to perform a few acts in relation to 
the principles of life or a few acts that 
will put. them in possession, after 
1. roper preparation, of this important 
knowledge. 

Jesus Christ went down into tht; 
waters of baptism and was immersed 
there by John the Baptist, who had 
authority thus to do; and many others, 
in the days of the Apostles, performed 
those ordinances that pertain to the 
everlasting Gospel. They were bap- 
tized for the remission of their sins 
by one that possessed the authority 
which, those Elders that I mentio;i 
now, possess. They possessed the au- 
thority to administer those ordinances 
■ — immersion ir. water for the remis- 
sion of sins, the laying on of hands 
for the reception of the Holy Ghost. 
These simple acts were actually per- 
formed by the Apostles in former 
days, and by the Seventies that were 
sent forth, and by all who were sent 
to preach the fullness of the Gospel. 
All that these Elders require in order 
that their predictions may be fulfilled 
is that people now shall do likewise. 

Jesuf, said on a certain occasion, 
that He would build His Church 
upon revelation: that is, Peter having 
received a revelation that Jesus was 
the Son of God and so saying Jesus 
replied, "Upon this rock will I build 
my Church and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it." The system of 
salvation and exaltation and glory 
was of such a character that there 
was this grand feature about it, all 
persons might receive a perfect knowl- 
edge of its divine source. 

When we take into consideration 
the difficulties those have to meet 
who obey these principles we see the 
necessity that they should have a 
perfect knowledge of that which they 
have received, and thus the Lord be- 
stows upon them the means by which 
they can contend against the difficul- 
ties and the persecutions and secure 
the blessings connected with these 
promises. When people follow the 
counsels of these servants of the Lord 
who are abroad preaching the Gospel, 
if they do not come to a knowledge of 



ELDER LORENZO SNOW.

the truth of these promises from 
heaven after they have obeyed, they 
ought to declare this: they should 
announce this failure to their friends, 
and to the public. I suppose, I am now 
addressing six or eight thousand peo- 
ple, and probably three-fifths of them 
have come 'from the distant nations of 
the earth, to these mountain vales, 
and these are the principles that we 
taught them, that they should receive 
a knowledge of this work, they should 
receive the Holy Ghost that would 
testify to them of the truth of the 
saying of these Elders that they had 
authority to administer the ordinances 
of the Gospel. Now, I ask, why are 
you here? Why are you sitting upon 
these seats? Why are you teaching 
your families and friends that these 
principles are of God, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God, that 
Jesus came down and talked with His 
people, the sons and daughters of God, 
as He did in former days? Why do 
you teach these principles, and why do 
you sit here instead of repairing to 
your homes and declaring that you 
never received any such divine testi- 
mony, as was promised you? 

I think if strangers came to me, as 
Elders now go to the nations, and 
testified to me that they had authori- 
ty to promise that the Holy Ghost 
would rest upon me after repenting 
of my sins, forsaking them, and obey- 
ing their message, and I did not re- 
ceive any extraordinary or miraculous 
manifestations, I certainly would not 
leave my friends, country, and home, 
as thousands and thousands have 
done. But it is a fact that I am 
speaking to thousands here that have 
come from long distances, from many 
nations of the earth, that are here 
and have been here for years and 
years; why is it they do not rise up 
and deny that they or their friends 
ever received this testimony? In 
these verses that I have read in your 
hearing, it is declared that the Son of 
God appeared in the Kirtland Temple 
sixty- one years ago, and spoke there 
to His friends. 

Years ago on my Palestine tour, I 
was one day upon the Mount of Olives, 
where Jesus left the earth and as- 
cended to His Father, witness3d by 



persons that were there present, and I 
did not doubt that I was at the place 
where, as T read in the Testament, 
that Jesus took His departure from. 
While I looked around and gazed 
about, I believed that I was there at 
that place; I believed that Jesus did 
actually take farewell of the world 
and go to His Father, because cer- 
tain individuals say and did make a 
declaration that that was the fact. 
Now I did not see these persons that 
testified to this extraordinary occur- 
rence. I saw no such persons; because 
it was over eighteen hundred years ago 
that this extraordinary circumstance 
occurred. But this that I have been 
reading in your hearing, occurred in 
this age. I was personally acquainted 
with the parties who saw this wonder- 
ful manifestation — intimately ac- 
quainted with Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery. I was acquainted with Joseph 
Smith for years. And I know Brother 
Oliver Cowdery to have been a good 
man, honorable, honest, and truthful; 
although years after this, Oliver Cow- 
dery left the Church for a while. He 
became proud and exalted, and left 
the Church; but the spirit and the tes- 
timony never left him, and after suf- 
fering the afflictions of the Lord, he 
repented and was very glad to come 
back into the Church, and he got back 
just in time to go into the other world, 
and that is just about the whole of 
it so far as Oliver Cowdery was con- 
cerned. 

Well now, these things are worthy the 
attention of the Latter-day Saints, and 
when we take them into consideration 
and bring them home to our under- 
standing, what follows? Why, that 
we should be the best people that God 
has upon the earth, and far better than 
any other. The Lord has given us a 
Prophet, to give counsels in reference 
to that which pertains to the general 
interests of the Latter-day Saints con- 
tinually, and He has blessed him 
abundantly. There is not one that 
can dispute the honesty and integrity 
of Brother Wilford Woodruff,our Pres- 
ident. We know him. Years and 
years he has been testifying of these 
things of which I have been speaking, 
and he says he knows them, he says 
he understands them distinctly; and 
we ourselves should know them. Per-

haps not quite as extensively as he 
knows them. For instance, an astron- 
omer may know a thousand things in 
reference to the revolving of the earth 
in its orbit around the sun, and know a 
great many facts in reference to the 
sun that thousands are ignorant of; 
and yet these thousands that are per- 
fectly ignorant of those many things, 
know one thing that this astronomer 
knows, they know that there is a sun, 
they see there is a sun; they know it 
just as well as he knows it. In refer- 
ence to this Gospel and our prospects 
in the next life, there are thousands 
that know it just as well as President 
Woodruff knows it; and when the 
resurrection is spoken of, they know it 
just as well as President "Woodruff 
knows it. In reference to "Mormon- 
ism," as it is sometimes called, there 
are thousands that know it just as 
well as Joseph Smith knew it. They 
know it because God has revealed it to 
them perfectly. 

There is no man that knows the 
truth of this work more than I do. I 
know it fully; I know it distinctly. I 
know there is a God just as well as 
any man knows it, because God has re- 
vealed himself to me. I know it posi- 
tively. I shall never forget the mani- 
festations of the Lord; I never will 
forget them as long as memory en- 
dures. It is in me. There is something 
to labor for, there is something to sac- 
rifice for. When the Elders go forth 
among the nations, they dare to say 
this; they dare to say that God has 
revealed himself. They dare to say 
that God has spoken to His sons and 
daughters as He did in former days, 
and they dare to say that He has 
heard the prayers of the house of Is- 
rael, He has heard the prayers of the 
honest in heart, and He has come 
down as He did in the days of Israel 
when they were in Egyptian bondage 
to deliver them; He has come down to 
relieve the distressed, and to confer 
upon them knowledge, intellectual^, 
spiritually, and to place them in a 
country where they can be blessed and 
saved from that half-starvation in 
Avhich many have been found where the 
Gospel reached them. 

Well, these are glorious principles 
that God has revealed to us, and our 
prospects are grand and glorious. Why, 
we could talk through all the days, the 



weeks and the months about the grand 
things that the Lord has prepared for 
those that are faithful and continue to 
the end. There should be greater union 
in our midst than we find today. 
There is a perfect union in the quo- 
rum of the Twelve. Should there not 
be a perfect tinion in that quorum? 
Most assuredly, every one would say 
Yes, a perfect union in the quorum of 
the Twelve Apostles; and whoever 
may be appointed to fill the places of 
those that are vacant, this union will 
still continue with us. And there is 
also a perfect union with the First 
Presidency, and should there not be? 
Every one will say, certainly, there 
should be. And should there not be 
a perfect union with the seven presi- 
dents of the Seventies? There most 
assuredly should be; we all say Yes. 
Should there not be a perfect union 
with the High Councils of the various 
Stakes of Zion? Certainly there should 
be, and there is a way to accomplish 
that union. And the same way with 
the various other organizations and 
quorums. Should there not be a per- 
fect union with the presidencies of 
Sta.kes? Certainly, and if I were a 
president of a Stake, I would not rest 
day or night until I had union with my 
counselors. Should there not be a union 
with the Bishop and his Counselors? 
Most assuredly there should be. 

Well, what is more important? 
Should there not be union in the fami- 
ly? Should there not be union with 
the husband, who is the High Priest 
in his family and expects to be with 
them in the next life, should there not 
be a perfect union with him and his 
wife, or wives, and his sons, his daugh- 
ters, his sons-in-law, and his daugh- 
ers-in-law? Most assuredly there 
should. And why should any man be 
satisfied, why should any husband and 
father of a family rest satisfied until 
he effects a perfect union, that is, just 
as far as a perfect union can be ac- 
complished? And in this matter the 
father should make himself just as 
perfect as a man can in this life be 
made perfect before his family. And 
the wife should make herself just as 
perfect as a woman can possibly do in 
this life. And then they are prepared 
to make their children just as perfect 
as they are willing and are capable of 
being made perfect. And the father

and the mother should be very careful. 
The wife should never in the presence 
of her children speak disrespectfully 
of her husband. If she thinks her hus- 
band has done wrong (he might have 
done), she should never speak of it in 
the presence of her children. She 
should take him out of the presence of 
her children and there tell him of his 
faults, in a pleasant way, but never in 
the presence of the children speak dis- 
respectfully of the father. And the 
father the same. He has no right to 
speak disrespectfully of his wife in 
the presence of her children. And I 
pray God to give the husband and wife 
the spirit and the understanding to 
correct themselves in such matters. I 
know that a great many of the difficul- 
ties that now appear, and the disre- 
spect that we find in reference to the 
Priesthood, among young people, arises 
from this fact, that there have been 
difficulties in the home circle.and there 
has been disrespect expressed in their 
presence, of the father by the mother, 
or of the mother by the father. Now 
I know these things are so. 

Well, I see my time has expired. God 
bless you, my brethren and sisters, and 
fill you with His Holy Spirit, that we 
may become sanctified, that we may 
be worthy to stand in the presence of 
God in time to come. Amen.

The Law of Tithing— Blessings Predicated upon its 
Observance — Practical Illustrations of its Results 
— Personal Testimony. 

I cannot say that I feel in excellent 
condition to address the Conference 
this morning, but it is desired that I 
should say a few words, or read a few 
words, to you, as the Spirit may direct. 
Before entering, however, upon my re- 
marks, I, perhaps, should make an 
apology, for it is really not agreeable 
with my feelings to diverge, in the 
least, from the channel of the remarks 
which we have received during this 
morning's service and throughout all 
the day yesterday; for the brethren 
have been led on spiritual matters, 
and they have spoken to us, by the 
Spirit, and have given unto us many 
very important truths, suggestions and 
admonitions, and I would delight to 
continue in the tenor of those remarks 
for the short time that I may occupy, 



but if I do not, it will be because I 
feel impresed that there is a duty rest- 
ing upon me which I will endeavor, 
by the blessing of the Lord to perform. 

I desire to remind the congregation 
that we are coming to the close of the 
fruitful season of the year, and while 
many of the people have perhaps not 
gathered as heavy crops as they would 
like to have gathered, and as they 
may have gathered in the years past, 
yet, taking our country, and valleys, 
as a whole, we are led to believe that 
the harvests have been bounteous, and 
that the Lord has blessed the earth 
this year, and has given to the hus- 
bandman excellent fruits for his la- 
bors; and it is desirable that we should 
reflect upon this matter for a little 
season.In connection with this thought, 
I will take the liberty to read to- 
you a few of the written words of the 
Gospel on temporal matters, which I 
think apply to us in our present condi- 
tion and at this time. 

In answer to a question, "O Lord, 
show unto thy servants how much 
thou requirest of the properties of the 
people for a tithing?" the Lord an- 
swered: 

"Verily thus saith the Lord, I re- 
quire all the surplus property to be 
put into the hands of the Bishop of my 
Church of Zion, for the building of 
mine house, and for the laying of the 
foundation of Zion and for the Priest- 
hood, and for the debts of the Presi- 
dency of my Church. And this shall 
be the beginning of the tithing of my 
people. And after that, those who 
have thus been tithed shall pay one- 
tenth of all their interest annually; 
and this shall be a standing law unto 
them for ever, for my Holy Priesthood, 
saith the Lord. Verily I say unto you, 
it shall come to pass, that all those 
who gather unto the land of Zion shall 
be tithed of their surplus properties, 
and shall observe this law, or they 
shall not be found worthy to abide 
among you. And I say unto you, if 
my people observe not this law, to 
keep it holy, and by this law sanctify 
the land of Zion unto me, that my 
statutes and my judgments may be 
kept thereon, that it may be most holy, 
verily I say unto you, it shall not be a 
land of Zion unto you. And this shall 
be an ensample unto all the Stakes of 
Zion. Even so. Amen. (Doc. and 
Cov., Sec. 119.) 

Again it is said: 

"Behold, now it is called today until 
the coming of the Son of Man, and 
verily it is a day of sacrifice and a day 
for the tithing of my people, for he 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



that is tithed shall not be burned at 
His coming, for after today cometh 
the burning. This is speaking after 
the manner of the Lord; for, verily I 
say, tomorrow all the proud and they 
that do wickedly shall be as stubble, 
and I will burn them up, for I am the 
Lord of hosts, and I will not spare any 
that remain in Babylon." (Doc. and 
Coy., Sec. 64, v. 23, 24.) 

I do not read the following words 
because I think they are entirely ap- 
plicable to the Latter-day Saints, nor 
because I suppose for a moment that 
there is not a large proportion of the 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints who have never 
in their hearts even thought of rob- 
bing God. But there are those among 
us who, even though they may not 
liave thought seriously that they were 
.guilty of robbing God, they carelessly 
:and through their negligence place 
themselves in a position in which the 
■children of Israel found themselves 
.anciently when the Prophet uttered 
'these words against them, and I pro- 
pose to read them as they are, and let 
them apply to whomsoever they will, 
:and whoever are not guilty, of course, 
"will feel clear in their consciences to- 
ward the Lord. 

"Then shall the offering of Judah 
.-and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the 
Lord, as in the days of old, and as in 
former years. And I will come near 
to you to judgment; and I will be a 
swift witness against the sorcerers, 
and against the adulterers, and against 
false swearers, and against those that 
oppress the hireling in his wages, the 
widow, and the fatherless, and that 
turn aside the stranger from his right, 
and fear not me, saith the Lord of 
hosts. For I am the Lord, I change 
not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are 
not consumed. Even from the days 
of your fathers ye are gone away from 
mine ordinances, and have not kept 
them. Return unto me, and I will re- 
turn unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. 
But ye said, wherein shall we return? 
"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have 
robbed me. But ye say, wherein have 
we robbed thee? In tithes and offer- 
ings. Ye are cursed with a curse; for 
ye have robbed me, even this whole 
nation. Bring ye all the tithes into 
the store house, that there may be 
meat in mine house, and prove me now 
herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I 
will not open you the windows of 
Tieaven, and pour you out a blessing, 
that there shall not be room enough 
io receive it. And I will rebuke the 
devourer for your sakes, and he shall 
not destroy the fruits of your ground; 
neither shall your vine cast her fruil 



before the time in the field, saith the 
Lord of hosts. And all nations shall 
call you blessed, for ye shall be a de- 
lightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts. 
Your words have been stout against 
me, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, What 
have we spoken so much against thee. 
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; 
and what profit is it that we have 
kept his ordinance, and that we have 
walked mournfully before the Lord of 
hosts? And now we call the proud hap- 
py; yea, they that work wickedness 
are set up; yea, they that tempt God 
are even delivered. Then they that 
feared the Lord spake often one to an- 
other, and the Lord hearkened and 
heard it, and a book of remembrance 
was written before him for them 
that feared the Lord, and that thought 
upon His name. And they shall be 
mine, saith the Lord of hosts in that 
day when I make up my jewels; and I 
will spare them, as a man spareth his 
own son that serveth him. Then shall 
ye return, and discern between the 
righteous and the wicked, between him 
that serveth God and him that serveth 
him not." (Mai. iii, 4-18.) 

Now I want to read another little 
passage of Scripture. It is ancient, 
however, but it has an application; 
and if I read it, you who hear it will 
be able to make the application, pos- 
sibly, to suit yourselves, or to suit 
your neighbors. Rather let us make 
the application to ourselves, each ol 
us, and let each of our neighbors do 
the same. 

"And as soon as the commandment 
came abroad, the children of Israel 
brought, in abundance, the first fruits 
of corn, wine and oil and honey and 
of all the increase of the field, and 
the tithe of all things brought they in 
abundance. And concerning the chil- 
dren of Israel and Judah, that dwelt 
in the cities of Judah, they also brought 
in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and 
the tithe of holy things which were 
consecrated unto the Lord their God, 
and laid them by heaps. In the third 
month they began to lay the founda- 
tion of the heaps, and finished them 
in the seventh month. And when 
Hezekiah and the princes came and 
saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord 
and His people Israel. Then Hezekiah 
questioned with the Priests and the 
Levites concerning the heaps; and 
Azariah, the chief priest of the house 
of Zadnck, answered him and said, 
'Since the people began to bring the 
offerings into the house of the Lord 
we have had enough to eat, and have 
left plenty, for the Lord hath blessed 
His neople, and that which is left is 
this great store.' Then Hezekiah 
commanded to prepare chambers in 
the house of the Lord, and they pre- 
pared them." (2 Chronicles xxxi: 5-11.) 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH.

No doubt, a good deal more could be 
read from the Scriptures in relation to 
this principle of tithing, which God has 
revealed to us in this dispensation, and 
which He requires at our hands, that 
we may sanctify, by obedience to His 
law, this land that it may become in- 
deed a land of Zion unto us; and the 
promise is, that if we will obey the 
laws of God, if we will put our trust 
in Him, if we will draw near unto Him 
He will draw near unto us, and He 
will reward us with His favor and His 
blessing'. He will rebuke the devour- 
er, and He will cause that the earth 
shall be fruitful, that it shall yield in 
its strength to the husbandman, the 
tiller of the soil, and to the herder of 
flocks, He will increase his kine, 
and will prosper him upon the right 
hand and upon the left, and he shall 
have an abundance, because he puts 
his trust in God; he draws near unto 
Him, and he is willing to prove Him, 
to see whether He will not open the 
windows of heaven and pour out bless- 
ings upon him that he shall not have 
room to contain them. Let every man 
who has received the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ receive this saying, and hearken 
to these words, for all they are worth. 
Some men may esteem them lightly, 
and those who do will, without doubt, 
fail to draw near, they will neglect to 
prove the Lord, they will not fulfill the 
commandments that He has given, and 
they will never know that God tells 
the truth, and that He is able to ful- 
fill His word and promise unto His 
people when they are willing to obey 
and keep His law. While they who 
appreciate these promises, who obey 
these laws that were given anciently, 
and have been renewed again in the 
dispensation of the fullness of times, 
for the blessing of the people, for the 
building up of Zion, for the feeding of 
the widow and the orphan, for the 
spreading of the Gospel of Christ to 
the nations of the earth, and for the 
gathering of the people from the four 
quarters of the earth, those who heark- 
en to these words, prize them as the 
truth, and apply them in their prac- 
tice throughout their lives, will come 
to know that God is a rewarder of 
those who diligently serve Him, and 
that He is able to fulfill His promises 
unto them. 



A short time ago I met with a 
brothei*— I need not call his name, for 
he is but one among thousands who 
can bear the same testimony that he 
bore, and he bears that testimony not 
only by the word of mouth but by the 
evidences of thrift, of prosperity, of 
progress and of improvement which 
surround him in the midst of the 
deserts, this season he has gathered 
in rich harvests, his farms having pro- 
duced in abundance, while the farms 
of many of his neighbors are clogged 
with weeds, and their harvests have 
been only one-half or one-third what 
his has been. How do you account 
for it? I account for it in the fact 
that God has blessed him, and so does 
he, for he is an intelligent man, a man 
that not only labors wisely and prud- 
ently, but in the fear of God, and in 
the desire of his heart to obey His 
laws. Said he to me and my com- 
panion with whom we were travelling: 
"God has blessed me because I have 
striven to keep His laws, and because 
I have been true to my family." He 
went out there upon the desert seven 
or eight years ago, impoverished by 
persecution and exile, being driven 
from his home and from his affairs, 
compelled to wander in exile for 
years, part of the time preaching the 
Gospel. He returned seven or eight 
years ago, and settled down upon the 
desert. Today, out of the earth, the 
burning sands, he has produced beau- 
tiful homes, he has fruitful fields, 
which are spread out before the eyes 
of any man who wishes to go and look 
upon them. He pays his tithing, he re- 
members his offerings, he is obedient 
to the laws of God, and he is not 
afraid to bear testimony to his friends 
and neighbors that it is through his 
obedience that God has blessed and 
prospered him, and made him what he 
is today. He is not the only one, 
there are others that are prospered in 
like manner. And I testify it is be- 
cause God has blessed him, and his 
soil, and his labors, and has given him 
the increase, securing to him the bless- 
ings for which he sought and labored. 
He has acted in good faith with the 
Lord, the Lord has known his heart, 
and has blessed him accordingly, and 
he is prosperous today in that desert, 
while as to many of his neighbors — go 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and look for yourselves at their broad 
acres. They tell the story for them- 
selves. His lands are clear from nox- 
ious weeds, because he has labored, 
and taken care of his lands, and that 
by his industry and intelligent appli- 
cation of labor, showing that God 
has inspired him, and enlightened his 
mind. The Lord has blessed him in 
his basket and in his store, in his la- 
bors and in the thoughts of his mind, 
he has been inspired and enabled to 
accomplish the work that he has done; 
I testify that it is because of man's 
. faith in the promises of the Lord, and 
his desire to obey His laws, that he is 
blessed and prospered of Him. 

I have been blessed. I have been pros- 
pered. I might have been more faithful, 
and I might have been more greatly 
blessed. But the Lord has blessed me 
insomuch that I have not lacked for 
anything that was needful for my wel- 
fare. I have not had luxury, nor 
"rolled in wealth," but God has fed 
and clothed me, with all of mine, and 
He has given us health and strength of 
body. And yet we might have done 
our duty better and been entitled to 
greater blesings, no doubt. I aim to 
pay my tithing. Now there is no use 
of my saying this unless it be true, 
because the evidences are there in the 
books. If I say I pay my tithing when 
I do not, Brother Heber J. Grant or 
some of the brethren who look after 
these things, men of figures, would go 
to the books, and they would say, "You 
said you pay your tithing, but you do 
not. We know just about what your 
income is, and here is what the books 
say." So I would stand condemned 
at once if I were to say to you that I 
paid my tithing when I did not pay my 
tithing, because not only the Lord 
would know I had not done it, but my 
brethren would know also that I had 
not done it, because the books show 
exactly what I have paid. No matter 
about that, the fact is this, I believe 
what I preach, and I do not preach 
that which I do not believe. I am 
not here for that purpose. I have not 
been called to that mission, or for that 
business. I preach that which I be- 
lieve and that which I do know to be 
true; and I do know that if men will 
obey the laws of God, God will honor 
and bless them. I have proven it 



all my life through. I saw it mani- 
fested in circumstances which occurred 
in my childhood, and I know that God 
has blessed the widow and the father- 
less when they have been obedient to 
His laws and have kept His command- 
ments. 

I can tell you the history of a widow 
woman, with a large family, who was 
more particular,if possible, to pay to the 
Lord what belonged to Him than she 
was to pay to her neighbors to whom 
she might be indebted, and she never 
was indebted to her neighbors, thank 
God, for anything that she did not pay 
to the last cent, because the Lord 
blessed her with plenty, and in her 
latter years she did not have to bor- 
row of her neighbors, nor did she have 
to call upon the Church for support 
either, but she paid thousands of dol- 
lars in products and money into the 
storehouse of the Lord, although she 
was a widow with a large family to 
support. I know this. I can testify 
of this, and that the Lord Almighty 
blessed her, not only in the products 
of her fields, but in her flocks and 
herds. They were not devoured. They 
were not destroyed. They did not lie 
down and die. They increased. They 
did not stray away; and thieves did not 
steal them. One reason for that was, 
she had a little boy that watched them 
very carefully under her direction, and 
prompting. Her eye was upon every- 
thing, she had supervision over every- 
thing, she directed those whom she 
employed, and her children; and I am 
a witness — and here sits another wit- 
ness [Patriarch John Smith] — that 
God, the Eternal Father, blessed her 
and prospered her while she lived.and 
she was not only enabled to maintain 
herself and children that were left to 
her in poverty, in a day of trial, and 
when she was driven out into the wil- 
derness, but she was able to feed 
scores of the poor, and to pay her 
tithes besides. "Verily the Lord pros- 
pered her, and she was blessed. I re- 
member one time when that same 
widow went to the tithing storehouse 
in this city with a load of potatoes in 
the spring — they had been kept over 
winter. And one of the tithing office 

clerks said to her, "Widow , T 

don't see any use of your having to 
pay tithing; you ought not to pay 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



37 



tithing. You ought to keep what you 
have." She said to him, "William, you 
don't know what you are talking 
about. I pay my tithing that I may 
be blessed." "Would you deprive me," 
she said, "of a blessing?" "No," he 
said, "I would have you keep your 
tithing and bless yourself with it." 
Said he, "There are a number of able- 
bodied people here that are well quali- 
fied to work and produce their living, 
but they are living from the tithing, 
and I don't see that a widow should be 
required to pay her tithing to feed 
those that are not working for it." 
Now these are about the words of this 
man, who was employed at the tithing 
office. But "no," said the widow, "I 
propose to pay my dues to the Lord; 
I propose to pay my tithing, and any 
man that would prevent me from do- 
ing this would deprive me of a bless- 
ing." Where is that man and his fami- 
ly today? He apostatized. He didn't 
last long in the Church. He turned 
away, and went back to the east some- 
where and took his family with him. 
He probably long since has gone to his 
rest. And not one of his family is in 
the Church. I bear testimony of these 
things because I know what I am 
talking about. I want to tell you a 
little more: While this widow was 
paying her tithing and being blessed, 
there was a little boy who really 
thought that tithing office clerk was 
about right. That widow's boys had 
to work very hard, and they knew how 
those potatoes were raised. They knew 
how the corn and other grain ^was 
raised, they knew what it was to lake 
care of the sheep, and the horses and 
the cows that were tithed, and all 
about it. They knew how it was done, 
for they had it to do. And one of the 
little boys of that widow thought that 
clerk was more than two-thirds right 
about it. By and by the widow died, 
but she left very comfortable property 
for her children, dug out of the desert 
here: the children were young, 
and I confess to you that they 
were not as faithful in paying their 
tithes and their offerings as their 
mother was; they had lost their 
mother, and what was the result? In 
a few years, everything that she left 
them had gone to rack and ruin. That 
was the result. The cattle were turned 
out upon the range, and that was the 



last they ever saw of them. The 
neighbors' cattle broke into the fields 
and destroyed the crops, and they did 
not reap the harvests they had done 
before; and it was only a few years 
after the death of the widow when the 
children had not much to show for 
what was left them, and it was not 
until they became old enough to ap- 
preciate the truth, and to commence 
to obey the laws of God and keep His 
commandments, that the Lord began 
to bless them again, to build them up, 
to increase their substance, and to give 
them what was necessary for their 
good. And as they have obeyed the 
commandments of God, the Lord has 
blessed them. He will continue to do 
it while time endures, if they continue 
faithful; and throughout the countless 
ages of eternity they will reap the re- 
ward of fidelity to the cause of truth 
and to the laws of God; and so will 
all the people of Israel. I testify of 
this to you in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn commencing: 

Come, let us anew our journey pursue. 

Benediction was pronounced by El- 
der Edward Partridge. 



The choir sang the hymn which com- 
mences: 

Com 2. dearest Lord, descend and 
dwell, 

By faith and love in every breast. 

Opening prayer by Elder Abram 
Hatch. 

Awake, yo Saints of God, awake! 

Call on the Lord in mighty prayer, 
That He will Zion's bondage break, 

And bring to naught the fowler's 
snare,

also. To arise before a congregation 
of this size is almost appalling, and no 
man that realizes the responsibility or 
teaching the people, it seems to me, 
would dare do so unless he felt that the 
Lord would assist him and be with 
him. 

"We have heard a great many ex- 
cellent instructions during yesterday 
and .this morning. We have had 
spiritual instructions, and also instruc- 
tions concerning practical duties, al- 
though there is nothing connected with 
our religion that is not really practical. 
We can apply that word to all the 
duties that devolve upon us as indi- 
viduals and as a people. 

We have heard considerable concern- 
ing the authority that God has re- 
stored. I feel that this is an im- 
portant theme, and one that cannot be 
dwelt upon too much in our hearing. 
There has been noticeably, it seems to 
me, considerable change in the Church 
in relation to that authority, and its 
claims upon and its standing among 
the people. Anything that contributes 
to weaken that authority or to lessen 
its value in the minds of the people is 
something to be avoided and, I believe, 
to be dreaded. The success and the 
triumph of the work of God thus far 
can only be attributed to the fact that 
the Lord has placed in His Church His 
Priesthood, and has given it authority; 
for to its guidance, to its influence 
and activity among the people, can 
be ascribed the prosperity of this work 
of our God. To no other cause can we 
attribute the deliverances that have 
been wrought out in our behalf. Its 
operations have been most beneficent. 
We have heard considerable concern- 
ing it in the remarks that have been 
made. But I have noticed myself a- 
mong the Latter-day Saints that 
where the people of God pay attention 
to the written word, and cher- 
ish and observe the written 
word, they are always better 
prepared to hear the oral instructions 
of the servants of God; they are bet- 
ter prepared to receive those instruc- 
tions; they have greater interest in 
seeking to obtain instructions, than 
they have when they are careless 
about the written word of God. I have 
felt for some time that there is an in- 
difference, not to call it by any 



stronger name, among the Latter-day 
Saints in regard to the word of God. I 
would like to ask this congregation, 
how many of you read the Book of 
Mormon, the Bible, the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants, and the dis- 
courses of the Elders as they are pub- 
lished? How many of you make a 
practice of reading the word of God 
as it is in these records, and as it ap- 
pears in published discourses? I am 
afraid that if you were interrogated 
upon this point many would say, "I 
have not read the Bible for such a 
length of time; I have not read the 
Book of Mormon for such a length of 
time; I have not read the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants for such a 
length of time; I do not read the dis- 
courses of the Elders that are pub- 
lished; I do not take the paper that 
contains them; I prefer other papers." 

I hope I am not doing the people of 
God injustice in making this state- 
ment; but I believe that comparative- 
ly few of the Latter-day Saints are in 
the habit of reading the words of God 
that He has given to us in the records 
that have come to us. I believe there 
are families, from what I hear and 
what I notice myself, that do 
not open the Book of Mormon, 
or the Bible, or the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, from one 
month's end to another. These books, 
if they are in possession of families, 
too frequently lie covered with dust, 
untouched, and not read. Do I do any 
injustice in making this statement? It 
I do, I am glad of it — that is, I would 
be very glad if what I say is not cor- 
rect, and that the Book of Mormon, the 
Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants and 
the discourses of the Elders are 
perused regularly, and sought for with 
avidity. If we talk about the living 
oracles and want to pay respect to 
them, how shall we do this? Shall we 
do it by never reading their words — by 
paying no attention to that which they 
say? That is a very poor way of do- 
ing. We ought to listen to their words. 
When we cannot hear their words, we 
should read them; for they are the 
words of the authorized servants of 
God. I feel that there is a great neg- 
lect among us in this respect. I notice 
it in my own family, I notice it in 
other families, and still in my own

family I do the best I can in these 
matters. But you will find that, 
among certain classes, scientific works 
are more read, magazines are more 
read, novels are more read, publica- 
tions that do not contribute to faith 
are more read, and the result is that 
we are in danger of a wave of in- 
fidelity and unbelief sweeping through 
our land, to the injury of the faith of 
the rising generation. It is a thing 
that fills me with more fear than al- 
most any thing else concerning our- 
selves and our children. Tou cannot 
take a magazine up — the best and most 
popular magazines — without finding 
articles in it that are — I was going to 
say designed — but their purport and the 
drift of their arguments are opposed 
to the truths that are contained in the 
Bible, Book of Mormon and Doctrine 
and Covenants. Talk with young men 
who go to universities and colleges, 
and you will find that many are more 
or less imbued with these ideas. I 
need only refer to a few — the age 
of the earth, prehistoric man, the crea- 
tion of man, man's entrance upon the 
earth, the nature of man's descent. 
The truth concerning these principles, 
is being undermined and weakened 
so that at the present time, if it were 
not for the Bible, the Book of Mormon 
and the Doctrine and Covenants, we 
ourselves would be at sea. But those 
who do not receive the Book of 
Mormon and the Book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants as divine 
are in a deplorable condition; 
they do not know what is true. Many 
of the clergy are in the same position 
as the rest of the world; they have 
adopted the new ideas concerning these 
scientific discoveries. Hundreds of 
clergymen, who call themselves min- 
isters of the Gospel, do not believe in 
Adam and Eve and their creation; do 
not believe in the Mosaic account of 
creation; do not believe that 
man is a son of God, descended 
from God; but they believe that the 
earth has been in existence and peo- 
pled by man ages before the period 
given in the Mosaic account. There is 
no doubt that the earth is much older 
than many of us think it is. But they 
mingle truth with error, and they build 
up fallacies, and they are propagating 
them; and the Latter-day Saints, who 



read this literature.and do not read the 
word of God, are in danger of losing 
their faith. 

We have in these three books to 
which I have referred the pure word of 
God— at least in two of them— uncoi- 
rupted, undefiled; and we can 
read them with a knowledge 
that they are true. We have 
the word of God in the Bible; but 
it has been translated by uninspired 
men. And no matter how men may 
pile up arguments and build theories— 
they may build them as high as these 
mountains of ours, and they may ap- 
pear to be true, yet we know they are 
not true where they come in contact 
with these records of ours, because we 
know that these records are true. God- 
has revealed them, and the Book of 
Mormon has been translated by a man 
of God and has come to us in purity. 
Therefore, when we read about our 
father Adam and our mother Eve, read 
about the fall of man, the creation of 
the earth or the peopling of the earth, 
about the Son of God and His atone- 
ment to redeem us from the ''ill, we 
know that those principles are true- 
and from God. 

It is important that we as a people 
should understand these things, and 
that we should build our faith mv 
pregnably upon the rock of revelation, 
constant revelation; not alone the 
revelation given two thousand years, 
ago but also the revelation given to- 
day] and which comes to us in its purity. 

I have been impressed very much of 
late with the danger to which our 
young people are exposed. When the 
parents neglect to read the word of 
God, when they prefer novels, maga- 
zines, or any kind of light reading, 
and do not set the example by read- 
ing that which God has given to us, 
you may expect the children to do the 
same. They will not take up the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon and 
the Book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants to read, because when 
they read these illustrated pa- 
pers, these catchy prints, these 
light novels, everything of a serious 
nature loses its interest. To people 
who are fed on highly seasoned food,, 
a plain diet is not inviting;men who 
have been accustomed to stimulants 
crave stimulants. People who read the 



4 o 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



class of literature I refer to are in the 
same condition mentally; they desire 
the sensational, and reading which 
does not have some of this element in 
it possesses but little interest. The re- 
sult is, our books and our discourses', — 
that which God reveals — go without 
being perused. 

I do not want to dwell on this — it is 
not necesary. I leave it with you to 
reflect upon it. I look upon it as a most 
serious matter that should be called to 
the attention of this Conference. I 
Wish I had language to make you all 
realize the danger we are in from mis- 
chievous literature, and the necessity 
for a reformation in our reading 
habits. Do not wonder at your sons 
and daughters going astray and losing 
the faith, when they do not read the 
word of God. 

Do you know what I believe about 
the living oracles? I believe that the 
bondage we are in today — I want you 
all to hear what I have to say, for I 
want to say it considerately — the bond- 
age we are in today is due to the 
neglect of this people in listening to 
counsel; and not only in not listening 
to it, but in not seeking it. We are in 
bondage — in debt. As a community 
we groan under a load of debt. We 
have, it is said, hundreds of unem- 
ployed people. I do not know how 
many there are, but reports come to 
the effect that they are numerous. 
Why is it? If this people had listened 
to the counsel of the servants of God, 
or had sought it, would this be the 
case? Certainly not, in my opinion. 
God has not led us here to these 
mountains to starve. He has not given 
the spirit of gathering to these Lat- 
ter-day Saints in the remote parts of 
the earth and brought them here to 
walk the streets in idleness, with 
their hands in their pockets. He 
has not given his spirit to such 
an extent that the authorities may 
have to repress it, and say 
to the Elders abroad, "Restrain the 
people; do not let them come here for 
the present." Why, what an incongru- 
ity, what a strange thing, to say that 
God would give the spirit of gathering 
to the people to come where they could 
not get employment, and where they 
would go hungry and have to live on 
charity; or, after they had come, re- 
turn to their own lands, as some have 



done. To me, the very sight of this 
condition is an evidence that there is 
something wrong, or something has 
been wrong. 

Let me refer to the railroads here. 
How many Latter-day Saints are em- 
ployed on the railroads in this State? 
I wonder who can answer. Who built 
these railroads? How many railroads 
are there in this State that the Latter- 
day Saints did not build and own? 
There are but few in this State ol 
Utah that they did not build and own or 
control. Hundreds of Utah men were 
employed on these railroads. Suppose 
that every man that had owned any 
share in them had said to himself, "I 
shall not part with my stock in these 
agencies, if I can help it; I shall main- 
tain my holdings in these roads, so 
that my fellow citizens can get em- 
ployment on them, and the policy not 
been adopted in our State of sending 
to remote states for people to do the 
work that our own citizens ca,n do," 
what would have been the result? 
Why, today, instead of our people 
walking around unemployed, as many 
have to do, they would find abundant 
employment. I do not want to risk a 
guess at the number that would be em- 
ployed; you can guess as well as I. 

Herein we are reaping the conse- 
quences of our selfishness and want of 
prudence. Do you wonder at it, when 
God has told us so plainly what we 
shall do? When God has placed men to 
guide us and to counsel us, and their 
counsels have been neglected and dis- 
regarded? I wonder that God has 
been so merciful with us as he has 
been in these things, and that He has 
not scourged us more than He has. 
I look upon the highest duty that I 
have in connection with the service of 
God — after personally laboring to 
make myself pure and to conform to 
all the requirements of the Gospel — 
my first duty after that is to build up 
Zion. God sent me to earth for that. 
He has given me His Spirit for that. 
He has gathered us together to build 
up Zion. It is the highest, the noblest, 
the plainest duty that God has as- 
signed to us, as a people and as in- 
dividuals. Up to this hour I have 
never labored for anything else. I 
would not go anywhere to build up 
anything else. I have never had the 
inclination to do it. I wanted every 



PRESIDENT GEORGE O. CAN SON 



41 



minute of my time, every faculty of 
my mind and body, every power and 
talent that God has given me, to be 
devoted exclusively to the building up 
of Zion. I have no other aim in life, 
and I want no other aim. Now, if this 
be my motive, I should not do any- 
thing at any time to injure Zion. If I 
own stock in a railroad, or in any other 
public enterprise, and am offered a 
good price for it, I should first ask 
myself, Is the sale of this consistent 
with the building up of Zion? Through 
the invitation of President Young, I 
was one of the original incorporators 
of one of our railways. I could have 
sold my interest in that at several 
times for a considerable sum of money. 
But I desired the control kept here, 
and I said, No, I will not sell. But 
the control passed out of the State, 
and though the stock has decreased 
very greatly in value, I have had the 
satisfaction of knowing that I have 
not contributed in any manner to 
the bringing about of the condition of 
things which I now deplore. 

Now, when I say "building up 
Zion," do I mean by that, building up 
a system that is peculiar to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and that will exclude all 
but Latter-day Saints? No. There is 
where the misconception arises 
in regard to our views and 
aims. Whenever Zion is built up 
as it should be, we will have 
a condition of things that will be the 
admiration and the attraction of the 
whole world. There will be no heavy 
taxation. There will be no officers 
working for enormous salaries. There 
will be no bribery. There will be no 
unthrift, money being spent lavishly, 
improvidently, and in a way to oppress 
the people. Whenever Zion shall rule, 
the very opposite of this will be the 
condition of society. The widow can 
live on her lot, and not be taxed to 
deprive her of it. The workingman can 
have his acre and a quarter, with his 
improvements on it, and can hold it 
without being taxed out of it. That 
will be the condition when Zion shall 
prevail. There will be no oppression. 
There will be no sin permitted that the 
law can reach. There will be a condi- 
tion of society that all honest, virtu- 
ous and upright men will admire. I 
labor with all my might, and have 



done since I was old enough, to bring 
to pass that happy condition. I pray 
for it with all the faith I can. It is 
my constant thought, by night and by 
day. I labor for it as well as pray for 
it. For I want a reign of righteous- 
ness to be ushered in. I want to see 
a condition of things in this State that 
shall be such as I have feebly attempt- 
ed to describe. And I know that the 
Latter-day Saints have the same de- 
sire. We may be mistaken at 
times; we may be misled; we 
may do foolish things; but 
underneath, underlying all our 
thoughts and all our acts, is the in- 
tense desire to see a better condition 
of things brought about, not for our- 
selves alone, but for all. And I want 
to say to you here to day that it never 
will be brought about until the voice 
of experienced men, especially inspired 
men, will be listened to. In any other 
community, where right prevails, men 
would not say concerning these men 
that are around here what they do 
about us. It is because we are mem- 
bers of a church that we are assailed; 
because they do not want the influence 
of that wisdom and that experience 
felt among the people. Here are men 
on this stand who have helped build 
this commonwealth. They laid the 
foundations of it. They carried it for- 
ward. They helped enact the laws that 
have governed it. And when this Ter- 
ritory passed out of the control of 
those who were influenced by the 
policy of these men, it was in a con- 
dition that was most admirable. It 
was out of debt, and lightly taxed. It 
was in a condition that people look 
back to now and admire, and regret 
that we cannot have such a condition 
exist today. Do not mistake me, and 
think that I mean the Latter-day 
Saints should have exclusive control of 
civil affairs; not so; no more than 
others should have exclusive control. 

Brethren and sisters, we talk about 
listening to the oracles of God. Do you 
listen to them? Do you think them 
entitled to your support and your con- 
fidence? If you had offered to you a 
good bargain in selling out some im- 
portant enterprise, would you jask 
yourselves, "How is this going to af- 
fect the interests of Zion?" Or would 
you say, "I can make money out of 



4 2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



this, and I will take care of myself?" 
I say to you that whenever Latter-day 
Saints come to the latter conclusion 
they will lose by it. The money that 
they get will not do them nor their 
children good. I only state a 
truism when I say this. To prove it 
we have only to look around us and see 
results. The men that have sought 
counsel and followed it have been 
blessed in all they have done. The 
money they have made has been pros- 
pered, because it has been made prop- 
erly — it has been made with a view to 
carrying out the purposes of God. 

I would like to bring these questions 
home to us in a practical manner. Let 
us look at them as practical men. We 
are here in the State of Utah. It is 
our duty to build up this State. Not 
for the Mormons alone — do not mistake 
my position — not for the Mormons, but 
for every man and woman that wants 
to live an honest and upright life and 
to be a good citizen. With the views 
and the knowledge I have, I should de- 
plore a feeling that would prompt us 
to build it up for ourselves alone. We 
are in the world, and a part of the 
world. God has given us a mission in 
the world, and we know how to fill it. 
We cannot be accused of egotism if 
we say that we know how to build up 
this country. We know what policy to 
pursue to make this community a hap- 
py and prosperous community. The 
proofs are in sight. We do not talk 
as men who have not had experience. 
We understand the question. And we 
know that if the people would listen 
to the counsels that are given to them, 
they would be led in a path of safety, 
a path of peace, and a path of pros- 
perity. But there is every effort being 
made, and has been for some time, to 
destroy this influence, and many of the 
Latter-day Saints, apparently, have 
not had discernment enough to dis- 
cover the spirit that actuates those 
who are making these attempts. 

I pray God to bless us in this Confer- 
ence, to fill us with the Holy Spirit, 
and to give unto us the words of life 
and salvation and cause our hearts to 
rejoice. I want us to see our errors. I 
want to talk about these errors. I 
want to warn, where we need warning 
: — and we do need warning. I know we 
are not as we should be. I am not 



satisfied myself with my own condi- 
tion. I am not satisfied with the 
condition of the Later-day Saints. 
I do not want to say anything to lull 
you to sleep. I do not want to sing 
any siren songs in your ears. It is 
pleasant enough to talk about those 
pleasant things; but here is a condi- 
tion of things before us that we can- 
not close our eyes to. How shall this 
condition be remedied? How shall this 
people be led and guided out of the 
difficulties in which they are involved? 
What can we say to you, to point out 
the dangers that you are in. and to 
show you the path that you should 
tread to escape these dangers, and to 
be the people that God designs we 
shall be. There is only one way — and 
we will all have to come to it — and 
that is to listen xo the voice of God 
in our midst, and ask for it, and not 
be as some are, "Don't talk to me. I 
don't want any church interference. I 
don't care how much you know; you 
may have all the experience in the 
world; but I don't want to talk to you, 
you are an officer in the church, ana 
I don't want any ecclesiastical inter- 
ference with me." Why, that spirit — 
where will it lead us to? You can 
answer that question yourselves, each 
one of you. I believe in the principles 
of government. I have my views con- 
cerning them; you all have, no doubt. 
But shall We, who know what we do, 
accept party as the paramount issue 
among us? When I heard the propo- 
sition that the Latter-day Saints 
should divide on party lines, I advo- 
cated it. I have not changed my feel- 
ings in regard to it. I know that it is 
better for us. But we need not set up 
party as an idol and worship it, as 
though it was a new-found idol, 
which we should bow down 
to and worship. That is the 
other extreme. We should not go 
to these extremes. We should act like 
wise people, and do that which is the 
best for us in every way. I do not, in 
saying this, wish to say one word 
about politics, only to clear myself 
from any suspicion of saying anything 
in opposition to the maintenance of 
party lines. As I have said, I believed 
in the division on party lines when 1 
heard it was being attempted. I knew 
it was the right thing to do. I have

been glad ever since that we did it, 
and I would not have it changed if it 
could be helped — and it can be 
helped. We should not interfere 
with each other in our party rights, 
our party beliefs, or party allegiance. 
But do not go to such extremes; do 
not be carried away by them. 

I pray God to bless us with his Holy 
Spirit, that during this Conference we 
may have a time of rejoicing. I 
humbly ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

John Nicholson ?s Clerk of the Gen- 
eral Conference. 

All of the voting to sustain the au- 
thorities was un?mimous. 

In presenting the names to fill the 
vacancies in the quorum of the 
Apostles and the First Council of Sev- 
enties, President George Q. Cannon 
said: 

It is well known to the Latter-day 
Saints that there are two vacancies in 
the quorum of the Twelve. Apostles, 
one through death, and another 
through the severance of a person 
from the quorum. We now propose 
to fill those vacancies, and present to 
the Conference the name of Matthias 
F. Cowley to be one of the Twelve 
Apostles. 

It may be well to state to this Con- 
ference that Brother Matthias F. 
Cowley is at present the second coun- 
selor to the President of the Oneida 
Stake of Zion. He is a man that has 
labored in the ministry very zealously, 
and is known, to all acquainted with 
him, as a man of worth. 

(His name was then put to the Con- 
ference, and he was sustained by 
unanimous vote.) 

It is now proposed that Abraham 
Owen Woodruff be ordained one of the 
Twelve Apostles. 

He has been a missionary to Ger- 
many, has acquired the language 
there, has labored very zealously in 
that mission, and since his return has 
been very zealous and indefatigable 
in his labors here among us. He is a 
youthful, but a promising man. 

(His name was then presented, and 
the vote to sustain him was also 
unanimous.) 

I may say, before sitting down, that 
the mind of the Lord was diligently 
sought for in relation to these appoint- 
ments, and we can say to you that the 
mind of the Lord was obtained, and 
we know that the men who have been 
chosen are the men whom the Lord 
has designated to us to fill these 
positions. 

There is a vacancy in the Seven 
Presidents of the Seventies. It is now 
proposed that Joseph W. McMurrin 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be ordained to fill the vacancy occa- 
sioned by the death of Elder Edward 
Stevenson. 

(His name was presented, and he 
likewise was sustained by unanimous 
vote of the Conference.) 

I wish to add in relation to this ap- 
pointment, the mind of the Lord was 
also sought, and this is as it came to 
us. Elder McMurrin is now on a mis- 
sion in Great Britain, and is one of 
the Presidency of the European mis- 
sion. 

"We wish to say to the Saints who 
are assembled here that neither of 
these brethren has known of this till 
now; so you must not be surprised if 
they are embarrassed. "When we de- 
cided upon it, it was understood that 
we should keep this to ourselves until 
they should be presented here. We 
did not want anyone to know about .it 
or to talk about it, and they are as 
much surprised, I suppose, as any of 
you can be. 

PRE ST. WILFORD WOODRUFF. 

said: I want to say to these two 
young men whom we have called to 
fill these places, they are occupying a 
very important position, a position of 
great responsibility, and we hope and 
trust that, although young men, they 
may have the spirit and power of 
their calling and Priesthood and Apos- 
tleship, and be enabled to magnify it 
and fulfill the duties required at their 
hands. "We will give our brethren time 
to express themselves now with regard 
to their views of the kingdom of God 
and the Priesthood unto which they 
have been called, and their purposes 
in magnifying and fulfilling this duty 
that is now resting upon them by the 
vote of the house of Israel. 

ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
weak on this occasion, and I do not 
know how to express myself. But I 
accept of the call with the same feel- 
ing that I have always accepted of the 
calls made of me by the authorities of 
this Church. I am in full sympathy 
with the organization of i the Holy 
Priesthood, and every sentiment which 
has been expressed at this Conference 
finds a cheerful and a complete 
response in my heart. I am grateful 



to the Lord for the testimony which 
He has given unto me in my youth 
concerning the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and the work 
which he was instrumental in the 
hands of God in establishing upon the 
earth. I know that it is true. I am 
grateful for this witness, and I trust 
that I shall be able, by the help of the 
Lord and hy your faith and prayers, 
my brethren and sisters — for I ask 
them, and I need them, to be able to 
show my appreciation of the truth 
and the work in which we are en- 
gaged, by my course in life. I recog- 
nize the fact that there is no amount 
of profession or pretension which sat- 
isfies the injunctions of the Gospel 
and that which goes to constitute the 
characteristics of a true Latter-day 
Saint. It requires that we shall square 
our lives by the precepts of the Gospel 
and the commandments which have 
been delivered unto us by the au- 
thority of God in this dispensation. 

I do not know that I need to occupy 
more of your time, my brethren and 
sisters. I feel weak and humble; in- 
deed, I feel unworthy; for I know my- 
self better than my friends know me, 
and I cannot express my feelings on 
this occasion. But I will endeavor to 
do my duty, by the help of the Lord. 
I will endeavor to keep the counsel of 
the servants of God, and to obey the 
requirements that are made of me 
from time to time, by the servants of 
God that are appointed to preside in 
the Church of Christ in this dispensa- 
tion. I know that these men are 
Prophets of the living God. And I 
know this day that a prophecy has 
been fulfilled which was uttered by 
Apostle John "W. Taylor many years 
ago. 

May God bless you, my brethren and 
sisters, and all Israel, and enable us to 
accept, not only in sentiment and 
theory, but in actual practice, all the 
counsel that is given unto us bearing 
upon the duties which the Gospel en- 
joins upon the Latter-day Saints; and 
if we do this I know that God will 
bless us and sustain us as his people, 
and no power will prevail against this 
work. May God bless you, and may I 
have your faith and prayers in my 
calling. I humbly ask it, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ABRAHAM OWEN WOOD- 
RUFF. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel very 
weak in attempting to express myself 
on this occasion, and I pray that the 
blessings of God may rest upon me, 
that I may enjoy your sympathy, while 
I seek to do so. Though I have not 
placed myself in this position, I have 
no doubt as to the inspiration of those 
men who have called me; and in occu- 
pying it I realize that I am not called 
to a position above the people, but to 
be one of them and a servant of the 
people of God. I feel that this is my 
mission. As Brother Cowley says that 
this day a prophecy was fulfilled 
which was uttered some years ago by 
one of the Apostles present today, I 
can indeed say the same as being ful- 
filled in my case. My father intimated 
as much to me something over three 
years ago, while I was upon a mission 
to Switzerland, Germany and Austria, 
although I have never mentioned this 
matter to a living soul. He told me 
that that was the mind and will of 
God concerning me at that time. T 
have sought to overcome my weak- 
nesses; and in standing before you I 
realize that I stand before my God, 
stripped of everything which will hide 
any of the deeds of my life, and real- 
ize that I appear in His eyes in a 
different light to what I appear in 
your eyes. I realize that I have had 
weaknesses, but God knows that I 
have sought with all my heart to 
overcome them and to fit and prepare 
myself for any call which He might 
make of me. It will be the pleasure of 
my life, and my greatest object and 
desire, to be your servant, and to as- 
sist in building up Zion. I believe 
that Jesus is the Christ, and that there 
is a living God. I have been placed in 
circumstances in my short life where 
I have had to prove this to be the 
case or to prove that belief in God was 
a deception. I also believe that Joseph 
Smith was a true, inspired servant or 
the living God, and that the princi- 
ples which were revealed through him, 
of faith in God, of repentance, of bap- 
tism, of the laying on of hands for the 
reception of the Holy Ghost, and the 
other principles connected with this 
Gospel, are of God and are necessary 
to salvation. I believe that the organ- 



ization that existed in the primitive 
church exists in this Church today; 
that we have the living oracles of God, 
and that these men who have been 
called to these positions are inspired 
servants of God. My Father in 
Heaven is a witness that I have never 
sought or desired any prominence in 
this world, but have rather desired to 
lead a quiet life, thinking myself not 
worthy to be anything but the least 
in the kingdom of God. And I know 
not why I should have been called to 
this position, were it not that I am 
the least, or have cause to be the most 
humble among you all. 

May God help me, and give me 
strength to do what is right and to 
discharge my duties, and be true to 
the confidence which my brethren have 
placed in me, and which you place in 
me upon this occasion. This is my 
greatest desire, and that I may be 
true and faithful, and useful in doing 
good, proclaiming the word of God, 
sustaining the authorities of the 
Church, and in looking out for your 
general welfare. May God give me 
this power; and if so, I will covenant 
—if He will give me strength, to over- 
come my weaknesses and to resist the 
evil of this world. I do covenant with 
you, as I have done with my God and 
do now with my God, that I will seek 
with all the power which He will give 
me and which He has given me, to be 
a faithful servant unto you, and to 
dedicate my life and all the energies 
which God has given me to the build- 
ing up of His kingdom and to the pro- 
claiming of His word. May God help 
me to this end, and help us all to ful- 
fill our duties, is my humble prayer, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF. 

Some experiences connected with the Ministry— 
His call to the Apostleship— The Saints to be 
Afflicted if they do not Labor for Zion— Redemp- 
tion of the Dead 

I feel thankful to God my Heavenly 
Father that I have lived to see the 
day when I have one of my own pos- 
terity called to this office— a privilege 
which all my predecessors, presidents 
and counselors, who are in the spirit 
world, have had. Their sons are sit- 
ting before me here. I need not men- 
tion them; you know them yourselves. 



4 6 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



I have had this desire in my heart, 
and the Lord has granted it unto me, 
and I am very thankful for it. I am 
satisfied that these two young men we 
have called will magnify their calling. 
I am satisfied that it is in their hearts 
to do it. 

I want to remark here the difference 
— I was thinking of it while the breth- 
ren were talking — between the posi- 
tion of my son and our brother here 
and my positon when I was called to 
the Apostleship. While in the worst 
apostasy we ever had in this Church, 
when Apostles and leading men were 
fighting the Prophet of God, the Lord 
told me to rise up, choose a companion, 
and go to Fox Islands. A great deal 
that I have done, and in my missions, 
I have been led by inspiration of Al- 
mighty God to do. I knew no more 
what was on Fox Islands than I 
knew what was on Kolob. I chose 
Brother Jonathan H. Hale as a part- 
ner. We went through Canada, and 
there met John E. Page, who was la- 
boring there. We administered to one 
woman that was possessed of the 
devil, which was cast out. We healed 
the sick, and the blessings of God 
were with us. We crossed on Lake 
Ontario, and from there down to Al- 
bany, and Farmington, my native 
place. I there met my father and my 
mother. It was the first time I had 
seen them since I had been a Latter- 
day Saint. I held a meeting among 
them. I baptized my father, my step- 
mother, my sister, several uncles and 
aunts, and organized a small branch 
of the Church, composed of all my 
relatives except one — a Methodist 
preacher, who was boarding at my 
father's house. Old father Smith told 
me, when he blessed me, that I should 
bring all my father's house into the 
Church. I certainly baptized every- 
body that was in the house at the 
time I was there. I then went on my 
way to Fox Islands. When I got there 
I found two congregations — a Baptist 
minister, a meeting house, a Baptist 
congregation, on the north island; a 
Methodist minister, a Methodist con- 
gregation, without any meeting house, 
on the south island. I commenced 
preaching there, and very soon saw 
why the Lord had sent me there. 
There was a people there wishing for 



the ancient order of things. I bap- 
tized most of those congregations. 
Without dwelling upon it, I will say I 
baptized over 100 while there. 

While in the ministry there I re- 
ceived a letter from Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet of God, in which he told me 
that the Lord had given him a revela- 
tion, and named to me the persons 
that were called to fill the places of 
those who had fallen. My name was 
among them. He said that he wanted 
me to gather up the Saints I had bap- 
tized and bring them to Zion. What 
were the circumstances? I was on an 
island of the sea. There was not a 
horse or an ox on the island. There 
was not a man or a woman that knew 
how to harness a horse. I told one of 
the brethren, who had some money, 
that we must furnish a train of 
horses, wagons, harness, etc., and he 
proposed to advance the money for 
that purpose. He went with me ana 
we bought about fifty horses; anu 
then I had to match these horses, and 
get harness to fit them. I went to a 
wagon-maker and engaged twenty or 
twenty-five wagons. I did this in 
order to prepare the people to go with 
me, according to the words of the 
Prophet. I arranged everything, agreed 
with this brother to furnish the money, 
and left in advance with the under- 
standing that they were to leave the 
first day of September. The letter to 
me was dated the first of August. I 
went to Maine, as my wife was there 
with her first child. I waited for this 
company to come to me, but they did 
not come till the first of October. We 
had then to travel from Maine to Mis- 
souri through snow, rain, and mud. 
However, we passed through it all, 
and got up there, according to the com- 
mandment of the Lord to me. 

That was the way I was called to 
the Apostleship, and what I had to go 
through. I have felt from that day to 
this that it has been good to serve the 
Lord, good to honor God and to obey 
His commandments. No matter what 
we may be called to do, or what office 
we may be called to fill, if we trust in 
God and do our duty, we will be car- 
ried through. Of course, I am here 
among you now. But I have been on 
the sick list a good while. Still the 
Lord has blessed me, and I have got

back to my former state, in a measure, 
of health and strength. How long- the 
Lord will permit me to live I do not 
know anything about; but I have to 
acknowledge the hand of the Lord in 
all these affairs with myself. I have 
been edified at the teachings that have 
been given us at this Conference. 
What President Smith has said, what 
President Cannon has said, is true. 
They have spoken upon principles 
that we should lay to heart. 

I tell you, brethren and sisters, the 
God of heaven has set His hand to 
build up Zion, in fulfillment of all the 
revelations of God to man from the 
days of Father Adam down to this 
day. The counsels that have been 
given here today are just and true, 
and we ought to observe them. I can- 
not sin, you cannot sin, we cannot 
turn from the commandments of God 
in anywise, but we are the losers by 
it. Again, I will say to this congrega- 
tion, God Almighty will afflict these 
Latter-day Saints if they do not pm- 
sue the course they are called upon to 
pursue. The Lord will build up Zion 
and carry out His purposes; but we 
will be chastised unless we listen to 
the counsels of the servants of God. 
If these Latter-day Saints turn to the 
right or the left, on political questions 
or on other principles, to separate 
themselves one from another and from 
the commandments of God, the Lord 
Almighty will hold them responsible, 
and they will be chastised for doing it. 
I know this as well as I know I am 
alive. I am anxious for the salvation 
of the Latter-day Saints. I do not 
know anything about what you are on 
politics, but we should be united to- 
gether and labor together to build up 
Zion. We have been called from the 
nations of the earth to do that; and 
if we do not do it, the judgments of 
Almighty God will rest upon us. I 
feel myself that the time has come 
when we ought to look around and 
about ourselves, and see what we are 
doing and what we should do. My 
prayer to God is that we may open our 
eyes to see, our ears to hear, our 
hearts to understand the word of the 
Lord and the responsibilities we are 
under. We stand here, a little handful 
of men and women in the eyes of the 
world, but we are called to build up 

Zion. 



Here we have four Temples, thank 
the Lord our God! Into those Temples 
we enter and redeem our dead. We 
have blessings which have never been 
given to any other generation since 
the days of Jesus Christ and the Apos- 
tles. The Lord has raised up a people 
for this purpose. You hold the keys of 
the destiny of your fathers, your 
mothers, your progenitors, from gen- 
eration to generation; you hold the 
keys of their salvation. God has put 
that power into your hands. But if we 
do not do what is required of us in 
this thing, we are under condemnation. 
If we do attend to this, then when 
we come to meet our friends in the 
celestial kingdom, they will say, "You 
have been our saviors, because you 
had power to do it. You have attend- 
ed to these ordinances that God has 
required." 

I will say to this congregation that 
the very men whom God raised up to 
lay the foundation of the American 
government — those noble men, from 
Washington down — have been to men 
in these Temples and required the or- 
dinances of the House of God at their 
hands in their behalf. They have told 
them the position they occupied in the 
spirit world, and those men have gone 
forth and fulfilled these requests, and 
those noble men have received the 
ordinances of the House of God. A 
great many things have been required 
of us as a people, and as far as we 
have fulfilled them, so far we are justi- 
fied. But do not let us lose the hold 
we have got. Do not let us turn our 
backs upon the commandments of 
God, and do those things that will 
place us in difficulties in days to come. 

The eyes of the heavens are over us; 
the eyes of God himself, the eyes of 
every Prophet and Apostle in the 
spirit world, are watching you, watch- 
ing this Priesthood, to see what they 
are doing and what they are going to 
do. It is of far more importance than 
we realize and comprehend. Let us 
awake to the ordinances of the House 
of God and do our duty, that we may 
be justified, for Christ's sake. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

"We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 
Benediction by Elder Seymour B. 
Young.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THIRD DAY. 



The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn: 

"Now let us rejoice in the day of sal- 
vation, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam, 

Good tidings are sounding to us and 

each nation, 
And shortly the hour of redemption 

will come." 
Prayer by Elder James H. Hart. 

"We're not ashamed to own our Lord, 
And worship Him on earth," 

was sung by the choir. 

ELDER C. D. FJELSTED. 

The Lord has led His people— Christ's promise has 
been fulfilled. 

I do not know if I shall be able to 
speak loud enough for such a large 
congregation. My voice is not very 
strong.but I feel thankful to our Heav- 
enly Father that we have this great 
opportunity of meeting together in a 
Conference, to have the privilege to 
sit and listen to inspired men that are 
full of wisdom and good counsel to 
us. We can certainly say we have had 
quite a feast during this Conference, 
and I for my part feel to thank God, 
the Eternal Father, that we have a 
living Priesthood amongst us, to direct 
and to guide us and to bless us; and 
there are no people that I know of 
on the whole earth that ought to be 
as grateful to our Heavenly Father 
for His blessings as we ought to be. 
The doctrines that we have listened to 
are of an excellent character, and we 
know they are from God, and I wish 
that we all carried them out that it 
might please the Lord to bless us still 
more. His hand has been over this 
people. He has led us unto this day, 
and we have confidence that He will 
continue to lead this people and that 
we will be able to help to build up 
the work of God. We can say surely 
the testimony that was promised to 
us and to everybody by the Savior 
when He was here has been 
realized. He said anyone and 
everyone that will do the will 
of my Father shall know if 
this is the work of God or not. We 



can testify by receiving this Gospel 
that we have received that testimony, 
that this is the work of God and not 
of man, and therefore I say we ought 
to be the best people on the whole 
earth; that we are called upon to be 
Saints; and that the Lord has given 
us the testimony that this is His work; 
and I say, Lord bless all Thy servants, 
Lord bless all who take an active part 
in building up the work of God, that 
they may be prospered in the land, and 
that the plans of the Wicked One to 
overthrow this work may fall to the 
ground, and that the kingdom of God 
may be built up and that His blessings 
may follow the people. This is my 
prayer and desire in the name of Je- 
sus. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS. 

Endorsement of the Conference proceedings — 
Testimony of the Truth. 

My brethren and sisters, I have been 
exceedingly happy during this Confer- 
ence, and, with you, have enjoyed the 
blessings thereof, and my heart is 
filled with gratitude for this great 
privilege of being numbered with the 
Church of Christ, with having a name 
and a standing in the Church. I have 
rejoiced exceedingly in the outpourings 
of the Spirit of the Lord upon His ser- 
vants, and their words and utteran- 
ces and their actions have had a 
response in my heart, and the Spirit of 
the Lord has testified to my spirit that 
all that hath been done is of the Lord, 
and with my whole soul I accept the 
counsels and instructions that have 
been imparted to us. 

I desire to bear my testimony not 
only to those truths that we have re- 
ceived during this Conference, but to 
the truth of the work of the Lord. I 
rejoice that through His grace the 
truth of this work hath been made 
known unto me. I have said to some 
of my intimate friends that I think it 
is a good thing that the Lord has made 
it known to me, for if He had not made 
it known beyond all doubt, it is very 
questionable with me if I could believe 
it. But I have received that testimony 



ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS.

and am pleased with the opportunity 
of saying- so once more to you, and I 
desire to live in harmony with it, and 
be saved in the kingdom of God. I 
know of no greater reward to strive 
for than this, and with all my soul, I 
desire to overcome the weaknesses 
and imperfections of humanity and at 
the last be received into the king- 
dom of our God. I hope that I may have 
strength to do so, and that the same 
strength may be given to the Saints of 
God and that the kingdom of God may 
come on the earth and His will be 
done here as it is done in heaven; all 
of which I pray for in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS. 

The wonders wrought by the Saints through the 
power of God— Completeness of the keys and 
authority of the Priesthood. 

It affords me great pleasure this 
morning, my brethren and sisters, to 
be present with you in this vast con- 
gregation, to worship the Lord our 
God, to learn of His ways that we 
may walk in His paths; and it gives me 
still greater, consolation to know that 
His people are still led by the Spirit 
of divine revelation, that notwithstand- 
ing our weaknesses, our shortcomings, 
our lack of faith, God is still with us. 
He is still guiding His people, and with 
me there is not the slightest shadow 
of a doubt but what all His holy pur- 
poses will be accomplished. I know 
that this is the work of God, I know 
that He is guiding His people. Of 
this I am more satisfied than of any 
other fact with which I am acquainted. 
I have no fears on this point, for the 
Holy Spirit has witnessed from the 
beginning, that God is with us, that 
this is not the work of man. Had it 
not been so, it would have failed long 
ago. It would never have brought to 
pass the wonderful, the miraculous re- 
sults, I might say, that we see have 
been accomplished by the revelation of 
God to Joseph Smith and to His people. 
No earthly power could have accom- 
plished what has been done by the 
people who belong to the Church of 
Jesus Christ. The results are mar- 
velous, not only in the building up of 
this commonwealth in these valleys of 
the mountains, not only in the preach- 
ing of the Gospel to so many of the 
nations of the earth, but also in the 



indirect results that have followed the 
ministry of the servants of God, the 
results that have followed materially, 
spiritually, intellectually, and in every 
way that I can think of. 

Our influence in the history of the 
world in this century is marked, and 
will be still more marked as the cen- 
turies roll round; and from a distance 
men will be able to perceive what has 
been really accomplished by those who 
for so long were despised, of whom so 
little was thought, and to whose mes- 
sage such a deaf ear was turned by 
the greater portion of the peoples of 
the world. And I can say, while I 
feel my littleness, while I acknowledge 
my insufficiency, yet I do greatly re- 
joice that God has accounted me 
worthy to be one of His people, to 
be one of the workers with Him in the 
great work of the regeneration of 
the world, in the fulfillment of His 
purposes, and in the bringing about of 
that reign of righteousness upon the 
earth, when all shall know Him, and 
when every man in every place shall 
meet a brother and a friend; for I de- 
sire to see righteousness brought 
about, I desire to see peace established 
upon the earth, I desire to see love 
abound amongst all the sons and 
daughters of Adam. I have no pleas- 
ure in iniquity, no pleasure in turmoil, 
in rioting; no pleasure in contention; 
but I desire to live to see the name of 
God glorified, to see the principles of 
eternal truth vindicated, to see Israel 
become God's first born upon the earth, 
and occupy the positon God has in- 
tended for His people; and I desire 
to see this earth prepared for the com- 
ing and reign of the Prince of Peace, 
of Jesus, our Redeemer, the Son of 
God. 

And these things I know will be 
brought about, will be accomplished 
by the labors and ministry of the ser- 
vants of God, under the direction of 
those who hold the keys of power in 
the midst of His people, to whom He 
reveals His mind and will. And I am 
doubly thankful to know that there 
is not one key of the Holy Priesthood, 
not one power belonging to God's 
kingdom, not one key of authority, not 
one principle pertaining to the building 
up of righteousness upon the earth, 
that God has withheld from His 
people, in these the latter days . I

realize that all these things have been 
given unto us. There is nothing lack- 
ing, but all that is necessary, if we will 
obey, to give us power to return into 
the presence of God, and to enjoy the 
blessings of the celestial kingdom 
throughout the eternities to come, are 
ours, are with this Church, have been 
revealed of God. We have been made 
partakers of all these things. There 
is nothing wanting. Not one link is 
left out. They are all ours if we will 
be faithful to God and to His cause; 
and this is my testimony, my brethren 
and sisters. I know it is true, and I 
bear it in the name of the Lord Jesus, 
our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 

Labors in the SoutL— The Mutual Improvement 
cause— Necessity of study and reflection— The 
great sin of uDchastity. 

I feel very humble, my brethren and 
sisters. I have discovered in my short 
career that I don't amount to very 
much; that all that I have tried to 
do within myself I have failed in. The 
only blessing of real comfort that I 
have received is in laboring in the 
ministry. Some men are more easily 
tired than others, and as far as 
I am concerned. I desire to be 
free in what I say, and I hope 
that I may be moved upon by 
the Holy Ghost, for I can testify to the 
children of men that I know what the 
Holy Ghost is, that is, I know what its 
influence is. I know that I have felt 
that joy, that peace, that satisfaction, 
that burning within me that comes 
from the influence of the Spirit of the 
Lord. 

I have labored for the past six 
weeks in company with Apostle Ly- 
man through the southern part of the 
State, largely in the interests of the 
Young " Men's Mutual Improvement 
Association, and I discover in associat- 
ing among the people that there is a 
great missionary work to be performed 
here at home. There are something 
over twenty-five thousand young men, 
from fourteen up to my age, and only 
a very small percentage of that num- 
ber are laboring earnestly and ar- 
dently to gain information and knowl- 
, edge pertaining to this great work. 
Talk about your missionary fields of 



labor, talk about the nations of the 
earth; I comprehend that the angel 
came with its message that the Gos- 
pel might be preached to every nation, 
to every kindred, to every tongue and 
people; but I want to testify to you, 
my brethren and sisters, that the ris- 
ing generation at home are being 
neglected. They are not being reached 
by the Priesthood of God; and if there 
is any place on the great earth where 
there needs an awakening and an up- 
lifting, it is right here in Zion, and, I 
want to say to you, the fathers and 
the mothers are helpless, and they 
know not what to do. I know the 
cause, too, and the sin will rest upon 
the parents. They have not followed 
this counsel, to instruct their children 
when they are young. President 
George Q. Cannon said we were in 
bondage, to a certain extent, because 
we had not followed counsel, and I 
want to testify that it is true, and I 
want to say that there is a great sin 
resting upon some of the fathers and 
mothers, because they have not 
taught their children faith, repent- 
ance, baptism, and the reception of 
the Holy Ghost when they were eight 
years old, and they are now reaping 
the sorrow of their neglect. We neea 
missionaries. I take the position that 
we need one hundred to start out with, 
to commence this mission here at 
home; and I don't know, before they 
get through with it, but they will 
have to preach on the street corners 
like the Elders do in the states and 
in Europe. 

A part of our labors in the southern 
part of the State were in the interest 
of a new magazine; for the general 
board of the Young Men's Associations 
have discovered that it is absolutely 
impossible to reach the four hundred 
and ninety-one associations in the 
Church without a magazine. But in 
that number of associations, we have 
16,580 young men that are enrolled, 
with an attendance, perhaps, of eight 
thousand. There is something like ten 
thousand that are not enrolled, and 
this missionary work must be begun. 

In our associating among the peo- 
ple, we discovered, and I want to testi- 
fy to what one of the brethren spoke 
in reference to that matter, that 
our people are not a reading peo-

pie, they do not diligently read the 
Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants. I 
want to say to you that I was so sur- 
prised that I have not language to ex- 
press it, when we discovered how few 
of our people, with the numerous hosts 
of children, there are that are taking 
the Juvenile Instructor. Why, we 
found places where a few years ago 
they took thirty or forty Juveniles, in 
some instances they are only taking 
three or four now. If that is not proof 
enough that they are not reading, why, 
I don't know what other proof you 
want. We have, however been sus- 
tained by the people of the south, and 
in the Stakes of St. George, and Kan- 
ab, and Panguitch, and Parowan we 
have met with a very kindly reception; 
and I believe there has been a re- 
awakening. 

But I want to say to the people, 
if you will permit me, something I 
have on my mind here. I would like 
to read to you a little from the Doc- 
trine, and Covenants, to show you the 
condition that we are in, some of 
us. It is a revelation given to 
Oliver Cowdery. It seems that he had 
the gift of translation, and he was 
somewhat impatient; and the Lord 
spoke to him in this manner — and I 
want to apply this to the rising gen- 
eration, I want to apply it to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, from the age of four- 
teen to ninety — we expect all of them 
to join the Young Men's Association 
between those ages, and as Apostle 
Lyman said, there is not anybody 
permitted to join the association who 
is older than President Woodruff. 
We believe that men who are aged 
should study just as much as young 
men. I want to ask the Latter-day 
Saints if that is a true doctrine, that 
when a man gets old he should quit 
learning and stop studying, and cease 
to progress. I want to read you what 
the Lord has said in this line, speaking 
to Oliver Cowdery: "Behold, you have 
not understood. You have supposed 
that I would give it unto you when 
you took no thought save it was to 
ask." Have you misunderstood, my 
brethren and sisters? Have you fan- 
cied that all you have to do is to ask 
and you shall receive, knock and it 
shall be opened unto you, and if you 
lack wisdom, ask of God who giveth 



to all men liberally and upbraideth not, 
and that you can sit down and make 
no other effort? As one of the breth- 
ren expressed it: "I fancy that the 
minds of some of us are chloroformed," 
and we have imagined that we would 
be saved in our ignorance, when the 
Lord has said, "Whatever intelligence 
you attain unto in this life will rise 
with you in the resurrection." Now 
He taught this lesson to Oliver Cow- 
dery: "But, behold I say unto you, 
that you must study it out in your 
mind. Then you must ask me if it 
be right; and if it is right, I will cause 
that your bosom shall burn within 
you; therefore you shall feel that it 
is right." Now these are the last days-, 
spoken of by the prophets; these are 
the "perilous times." And I want to* 
say to you that mountains of obstruc- 
tions will be placed before this people,, 
and if you have not been tried, you: 
will be; if you have not been tested,, 
you will be, before you gain eternal 
life. And before we pass our opinion 
unwisely, as we do, it is well for us 
to "study it out in our minds." 

I am fearful that some of the Latter- 
day Saints simply come to the leaders 
and listen to the servants of God, and 
they never study it out in their minds; 
they never go to the written word, 
and compare it with the servants of 
God in their doctrines and teachings, 
and consequently they are unable 
to judge righteously, and they are 
losing confidence. Their confidence is 
being shaken, and they are unable to 
judge, because they have not first 
studied it out in their minds, because, 
as a people, we are mentally lazy. I 
will say that, because I do not expect 
to preach here again for a long time. 
If any of us have got a bad taste in our 
mouth for anything that has trans- 
pired, why, let us repent, let us study 
it out in our minds, and then go to 
our Father, in humility, and ask Him if 
it is right, and if it is right He will 
cause a burning within our bosoms, 
and we shall know that it is right; 
but if it be not right, we shall have 
no such feelings, but we shall have a 
stupor of thought. And how greatly 
blessed are we in that direction! We 
are all blessed, more or less, with a 
stupor of thought. 

But I pray the Lord to bless this peo- 
ple. Why, you are a wonderful peo-

GENERAL CONEERENCE 



pie. The Lord has blessed you as 
He has blessed no other people. He 
has given you the Holy Ghost. Re- 
member how particular He was with 
His Apostles, with His servants that 
He sent out to preach the Gospel. He 
promised them the Holy Ghost, "whom 
the world cannot receive," and we are 
in a different situation to what the 
world is. As Paul says: 'What! - 
know ye not that ye are the temples 
of the Holy Ghost, and that ye are not 
your own; and if any man defile the 
temple of God, him shall God destroy, 
for the temple of God is holy, which 
temple ye are." Now I want to say 
to you people, in soberness, and with 
consideration — I don't want to be an 
alarmist, I don't want to be a revival- 
ist; but I want to say to you, the great 
sin that is creeping in among this peo- 
ple, together with other worldly sins, is 
the sin of adultery. This is creeping 
in amongst us, and in some instances 
our dau-hters are running the streets 
as common harlots, and we, seeming- 
ly, cannot help ourselves. But I want 
to say to you, there needs be an awak- 
ening. I want to tell you there needs 
to be a fear planted in the hearts of 
the youn~ people. Take the Book of 
Mormon. Go to the 316th page, and 
read what Alma said to his son Cori- 
anton, who had left the ministry, and 
had followed after the harlot Isabel. 
He told him what a terrible crime 
adultery was, that it was next to the 
shedding of innocent blood. O, I am 
fearful that our young people do not 
compreherM that great sin that is 
creeping in amongst us; and, as the 
Prophet Joseph said, a man that com- 
mits adultery cannot enter into the 
celestial kingdom of God. If he en- 
ters any kingdom, it will not be the 
celestial kingdom of God. I pray that 
our people may be moved upon to be 
a virtuous, to be an honest, to be a 
faithful people; this is the prayer of 
my heart, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

MATTHIAS F. COWLEY- 

Beneficial character of Mutual Improvement as- 
sociations — Operation of the Holy Spirit — Re- 
ception of blessings predicated upon Obedience 
— Secular education does not prevent crime. 

My brethren and sisters, in standing 
before you a short time, I humbly so- 
licit your faith and prayers, that some- 



thing appropriate may be suggested to 
our minds. I have rejoiced, and do 
rejoice, in the instructions of this Con- 
ference; and our joy may be said to 
consist, through the Holy Spirit, in the 
propriety and the practical value of 
the teachings imparted unto us 
through the servants of the Lord. 

I have been highly edified in the re- 
marks directed to the youth. I feel 
especially interested in the cause of 
Mutual Improvement, because I recog- 
nize in it an institution established by 
the wisdom of the Lord through His 
servant, President Young, affording 
the young men and young women of 
Zion an opportunity to exercise the 
talents with which the Lord has en- 
dowed them. And it is a work of great 
magnitude. It is necessary, as stated 
by President Cannon and Brother 
Kimball, that we should study the 
Scriptures and become conversant 
with the principles of the Gospel, with 
the predictions of the Prophets, and the 
purposes of theAlmighty concerning us 
and mankind at large, and, not only 
in the direction of these particulars 
which are designated as strictly re- 
ligious, but to become acquainted with 
all good principles. I think it is in sec- 
tion 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants 
where the injunction is placed upon us 
by the Lord through the Prophet Jo- 
seph, and it is always binding, that 
we should seek for wisdom by study, 
out of the best books, by prayer and 
also by faith; that we should become 
acquainted with the laws of the king- 
doms and nations of the earth, and 
with the law of the kingdom of God; 
should become acquainted with things 
which are above the earth and which 
are in the earth; we might say, become 
informed regarding all things as the 
Lord, through various agencies, gives 
us opportunities for acquiring knowl- 
edge. 

What a broad field of study for the 
youth of Zion! "Would any man with 
intelligence and honesty dare to attri- 
bute narrow-mindedness to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints? I think not. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints are not afraid to come 
in contact with the world in every 
form. They are not so narrow but 
what they are willing to receive truth 
wherever it can be found. We recog- 
nize the fact that there are fragments 
of truth scattered abroad in the earth, 



ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY.

that they have been handed down 
among the chldren of men on the pages 
of history and by tradition from gene- 
ration to generation. Many of the 
oriental religionists that are designat- 
ed by the more enlightened as heath- 
en have ideas which are not at vari- 
ance with some of the principles of the 
Gospel. In reading the history of 
Mexico, we find statements there re- 
garding traditions of the ancient in- 
habitants of that land in reference to 
the Deity and in regard to the coming 
of a God to this earth; and we can see 
that it has reference to the mission 
of the Son of God among the children 
of men. And so in regard to the people 
of Asia and other countries of the 
globe. The youth of Zion should be 
conversant with these things. 

There is one grand and glorious prin- 
ciple, that should be understood by 
the young people to guide them in 
their studies and investigation in re- 
gard to all things, and that is, the 
possession of the Holy Spirit. No man, 
says the Apostle Paul — and it has been 
repeated in every Gospel dispensation 
— "can understand the things of God 
but by the Spirit of God." He may un- 
derstand the things of man by the 
spirit of man; but the Spirit of 
God has a mission, as stated by the 
Savior in the 16th chapter of St. John, 
where he says, "Howbeit, when the 
spirit of truth is come, he shall guide 
you into all truth, for," he says, "he 
shall not speak of himself" — here is 
another lesson in that passage: even 
the Holy Spirit does not assume au- 
thority to speak — "for he shall not 
speak of himself, but that which he 
heareth, that shall he also speak. He 
shall take of the things of the Father 
and shall show them unto you," show- 
ing that the Spirit of the Lord associ- 
ates with the Father and the Son, 
and communicates the mind and will 
of the Lord to the people, who are so 
happy and so blessed as to enjoy that 
great gift. If we can understand the 
things of man by the spirit of man, 
we can also understand the things of 
man by the Spirit of God, for it 
"searcheth all things." How essential 
it is that the young men and the young 
women of Zion should enjoy the com- 
panionship of the Holy Spirit, the im- 
portance of which cannot be spoken, 
it cannot be fully realized. And to 



enjoy that spirit, we should understand 
another principle, and that is that to 
possess it we must harmonize our lives, 
our daily walk and conversation with 
certain requirements that the Lord has 
made of us. It is one thing to receive 
the Holy Spirit; it is another thing to 
keep it constantly with us. We re- 
ceived it on condition of faith in God 
and in His Son Jesus Christ, and the 
condition of repentance from all sin— 
a genuine repentance, a laying aside 
of the things which are obnoxious to 
God. We received it on condition of 
accepting the simple ordinance of 
baptism in water for the remission of 
sin. We received it on condition of 
the imposition of hands by men au- 
thorized of the Almighty to perform 
that sacred ordinance for the gift of 
the Holy Ghost. We never can isolate 
the principles of the Gospel, and expect 
by the mere outward acceptance of 
that ^ principle, to enjoy the blessing 
which is attached to it. No man has 
received a remission of sins by baptism 
alone. No man has received the Holy 
Ghost by the imposition of hands 
alone. There must be associated with 
it the fulfillment of the conditions that 
belong to these fundamental steps 
which introduce us into the Church of 
Christ. Simon the sorcerer was bap- 
tized by Philip. He went through the 
ordinance in form, but the Apostles 
Peter and John came down from Je- 
rusalem and laid their hands upon and 
baptized the Samaritans; and those 
that were penitent only, who had pure 
faith in God, pure conviction that Je- 
sus was the Christ, received the Holy 
Ghost and enjoyed some of the gifts 
thereof; and when Simon the sorcerer 
saw that they enjoyed this gift, he 
offered the apostles money, and he 
said unto them, "Give unto me also 
this gift that on whomsoever I lay my 
hands they may receive it also." And 
the Apostle Peter.by the authority and 
power of God which rested upon him, 
said unto him: "Thy money perish 
with thee, seeing thou hast thought to 
buy the gift of God with money. I 
perceive that thy soul is in the gall of 
bitterness and sin." 

So it may be said of all the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Men have embraced 
the Gospel, that is, in form. 
Some have been introduced into the 
Church formally, but they have

dropped by the wayside. We found 
hundreds of backsliders in the states 
of Missouri and Illinois, who had em- 
braced the Gospel, many of them in 
the days of Joseph Smith. Some had 
received a testimony and sinned 
against it and became embittered, while 
others had not received it in sincerity 
of heart, and they were easily led 
aside. I want to impress upon the 
youth that to enjoy this Spirit, we 
must not only receive it by the ordi- 
nances of the Gospel, but we must take 
a course in life that we can keep it 
coristantly with us. The Spirit of the 
Lord will not associate with evil in any 
form. As quoted by Brother Kim- 
ball, the Spirit of the Lord will not 
dwell in unclean temples; and the 
Apostle Paul felt so Impressed with 
this that on one occasion he said to 
the Corinthian Saints: "Evil com- 
munications corrupt good manners," 
and he cautioned them to avoid evil 
association, to avoid coming in contact 
with the influences that were of the 
world. The Savior gave this caution 
to his disciples, when He said unto 
them, "Beware of the leaven of the 
Gentiles." The young people should 
understand that the foundation, the 
stepping stone to Mutual Improvement 
is the reformation of life. If there is 
a young man that is guilty of any 
habit that is contrary to the injunc- 
tions of the Gospel, the first step neces- 
sary is to lay that aside. Lay aside 
the habit of smoking cigarettes, lay 
aside the habit of chewing tobacco, 
lay aside the habit of swearing and 
profanity, and Sabbath breaking, and 
seek unto God in humble prayer for 
the enjoyment and the impressions of 
the Holy Spirit. 

If we will do that, the Lord will pre- 
serve us from scepticism and infidelity. 
One of the brethren in his remarks 
spoke about neglecting to read the 
Scriptures and thereby becoming an 
easier prey to infidelity. I thought of 
my own testimony regarding this 
work, that no matter what might be 
the skill of the sceptic or the infidel 
in his efforts to tear down and destroy 
the standards of Christianity that 
every young man might feel 
as I felt myself, that no 
matter what may be their 
theory, however plausible may appear 



their reasoning, I know that this is the 
work of God, regardless of these 
things. I know that there is a spirit 
and a power associated with what they 
denominate Mormonism that is beyond 
and above the power and the natural 
intelligence of man. I have received 
this testimony. But, in addition to 
that, my young brethren, we should 
become so conversant with the prin- 
ciples of truth, and also with the theo- 
ries, if necessary, that are advanced 
by the world against the true doctrines 
of Christ, that we may be able, when 
under the influence of the Spirit of God, 
to refute them and show their incon- 
sistency by the light of truth. 

I have often been impressed with a 
few statistics that were published by 
President John Morgan, several years 
before his decease. He wrote, I think 
to the wardens of the penitentiaries at 
Detroit, and Joliet, 111., and Sing Sing, 
New York, and he asked the question 
of the keepers of those government 
houses of correction to give him a clear 
and truthful statement as to what per- 
centage of the convicts in their respec- 
tive prisons could read and write; he 
also wanted to know what percentage 
of them had an understanding of 
grammar and rhetoric. "When the 
answers came back, if I remember cor- 
rectly, they showed that there were 
fully ninety per cent of all the crimi- 
nals in those houses of correc- 
tion that could read and write; 
and there were some — I think 
seventy-five per cent of them 
— that were quite grammatical in their 
conversation; a still smaller per cent 
that had a very good understanding of 
arithmetic and other branches, and 
some of them were highly educated. I 
remember the statement by President 
Morgan that there was a greater per- 
centage of well educated people in the 
penitentiary, compared with the whole 
of the inmates, than there was out- 
side of the prisons as compared with 
the entire population of the United 
States. To me this was a great les^- 
son. It was a lesson that impressed 
me that the mere education of the in- 
tellect is not sufficient. Men may un- 
derstand astronomy, they may under- 
stand mathematics, they may be effi- 
cient in the beautiful art of music, they 
may be conversant with law and the

science of civil government as it ob- 
tains in the nations of the earth, and 
at the same time they may be corrupt, 
they may be dishonest men, their mo- 
tives may be impure in the sight of 
God. 

No man, no matter what may be his 
natural attainments, if he does not en- 
joy the Spirit of the living God, if his 
life is not circumspect, squared by the 
principles and doctrines .of the Son of 
God, is a well educated Latter-day 
Saint, he does not enjoy the true light, 
he is not a safe man to follow. An- 
other striking thing in the history of 
this work is that when men — no mat- 
ter how prominent they have become 
— have ceased to follow in the counsels 
of the Prophets of God, or have violat- 
ed their covenants in any respect, 
especially if it has been in a serious 
manner, they have ceased to enjoy the 
light that comes from the Father. 
There is one man spoken of in the 
Book of Mormon in connection with 
the Prophet Joseph Smith. You know 
that Nephi prophesied that of the seed 
of Joseph that was sold into Egypt in 
the last days, the Lord would raise up a 
Prophet whose name should be Joseph, 
and his father's name should be Jo- 
seph; and he said that this Prophet 
Joseph in the last days should not be 
mighty in speaking, but he should be 
mighty in writing the words of the 
Lord, like unto Moses. And he says, 
"God will raise up unto him a mouth- 
piece like unto Aaron." Now by read- 
ing the Doctrine and Covenants, we 
know who that mouth-piece was. We 
know the name of that man that en- 
joyed so much of the Spirit, during his 
faithfulness, that his tongue was elo- 
quent and powerful; but when he 
ceased to follow the line of his duty, 
when he despised the day of small 
things, when he became lifted up in 
the pride of his heart, became jealous 
of his associate, the Prophet, and be- 
gan step by step to turn aside from the 
course of rectitude whch the Gospel 
enjoined upon him, that man lost his 
power, lost his influence; he lost his 
tongue of eloquence, and went down 
into oblivion. I heard, many years 
ago, President George Q. Cannon say 
that when he was a boy he was present 
in Nauvoo when that man stood up be- 
fore a congregation and sought to lay 



his claims before the people to be the 
guardian of this Church, and I re- 
member distinctly that President Can- 
non said, he spoke as he had never 
heard him speak before, that is, his 
remarks were characterized by weak- 
ness, a lack of power and a loss of 
what he had previously enjoyed. 

These are lessons that ought to be 
stamped upon the hearts of the young 
men. Such way-marks are scattered 
along the path of the history of the 
Church from the days of the Prophet 
Joseph until the present time. 

It is a testimony of the divine au- 
thenticity of this work, that no man 
has a monopoly on the mercy of God. 
He may be ever so great in the eyes of 
the people, he may be ever so promi- 
nent in his position in the Holy Priest- 
hood, but he must comply with the 
conditions, as every man and woman 
in this Church must do, in order to 
retain the blessing and the favor of 
God. No man has a monopoly on the 
work of God. No man can sin with 
impunity. No man can turn aside 
from the path of rectitude, without 
meeting the consequences which are 
specified in the Gospel of our Lord and 
Savior. So, my young brethren, re- 
member this, that while men may be- 
come educated in the world, they may 
become powerful physically, they may 
become powerful mentally, but until 
they are educated spiritually and the 
moral properties of their natures are 
reached and touched and cultivated, 
the soul is not educated, for "the spirit 
and the body is the soul of man." It 
is not complete without, and God has 
provided that in this Church, and in 
the glorious plan of salvation, the en- 
tire soul shall be educated in the ways 
of truth, and in the knowledge of 
things that are good and elevating in 
the sight of God. Remember, there- 
fore, that we should cultivate the 
Spirit of the Lord in our hearts, and 
keep it ever as our constant guide. Lay 
aside everything that would grieve 
that Spirit, listen to the counsel of the 
servants of God, heed the warning 
voice which they have given unto us; 
and then I testify unto you, that the 
doctrines of this Church as stated by 
the Lord to Joseph, the Prophet, will 
be distilled upon your minds as the 
dews from heaven, and you will be

proof against scepticism and infideli- 
ty; and the day will come when the 
sons and daughters of Zion shall grow 
up without sin unto salvation. God 
bless you. Amen. 

ABRAHAM OWEN WOODRUFF- 

The young who have experience should take an 
interest in wilful backsliders — Force of example 
— Potency of prayer— Truth in God. 

My brethren and sisters and friends, 
I have been highly edified this morn- 
ing and interested in the remarks of 
the brethren, and I trust that the 
words which I may be led to utter will 
not detract any from the interest, 
from the good feeling and the good 
things which we have already received. 

I believe that there are not a great 
many young men who have sought 
for a testimony of Je"sus Christ who 
would not, if called upon, leave all 
which they have and dedicate their 
time to the preaching of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ abroad; but 
how many of us, after returning home 
from our missions, still take that 
active interest in the spreading of the 
truth and the preaching of the Gospel 
that we did in the missionary field? 
How many of us will pass by com- 
panions and young brethren who, 
perhaps, have drifted from the way 
of truth and will never heed them, 
never seek to bring them back to the 
path upon which they should walk, 
and show them an example. We are 
negligent, I think, my brethren and 
sisters, in this regard. We will travel 
hundreds of thousands of miles, per- 
haps, to preach the Gospel in foreign 
lands, but, as Brother Kimball has al- 
ready intimated, we neglect this duty 
at home. We do not seek as we should 
do to set examples to our young 
brethren and sisters and get them to 
take an active interest in the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is no 
doubt as to the undesirable condition 
existing among some of the young 
people with whom we are associated 
in this Church. Still, at the same 
time, we are more prone to censure 
them for the evils which are done than 
we are to show them a way whereby 
they may escape them. 

In preaching the Gospel here at 
home, I have met with circumstances 
which taught me that there are 
parents in this Church who teach 



their children to keep the Word of 
Wisdom, and they will go right ahead 
drinking their tea and coffee; or the 
father will go on chewing tobacco, or 
smoking his pipe. At the same time 
they will, perhaps, tell their children 
that they should be exemplary, set- 
ting a good example to others. We 
can preach the Gospel— especially 
fathers and mothers — more through 
example than by precept. If we teach 
our children while they are young to 
pray, and if all through their lives 
they are called upon morning and 
evening to surround the family altar, 
they will not depart from that custom 
of prayer, and they will not lose that 
faith in God which was instilled into 
their minds at their mother's knee 
and around the family altar, although 
they may, perhaps, for a time forget 
these things. They may, perhaps, 
be mixed with the different 
elements that are foreign to the 
Spirit of God. and become neglectful 
of their duties. Still, sometime in their 
lives, the better part of man will 
crop out, and the teachings they 
have received by the fireside will 
come to them as a blessing and a sup- 
port. We are all here to gain experi- 
ence, as I understand this life. At 
the same time, how much evil, and 
how much suffering could be prevent- 
ed if greater care were taken in 
preaching the principles of the Gospel 
at the fireside, and not depending on 
mere Sunday religion as much as we 
do. We should, I believe, make the 
Gospel of Christ a part of our every 
day life. How many times I have 
seen the example where children had 
been taught to pray, that they would 
grow up and be men and women of 
prayer, they would have faith in God. 
Once, while upon my mission, I had 
a little experience which pleased me 
very much, in receiving a letter from 
a sister of mine who resides in this 
city. She said that during the time 
that she was writing the letter, her 
son, then a little over two years old, 
came to her knee and asked where hl» 
uncle was. She replied, "upon a mis- 
sion." He said, "a mission is a long 
time, isn't it?" She replied, "It will 
be two or three years." He says, "well, 
write uncle in the letter that I pray for 
him." This knowledge that I had ot 
the prayer of this little child, and ol

the prayers of my relatives and dear 
friends at home, in my behalf, was a 
greater support to me than almost 
anything, any knowledge that I had 
except the knowledge that Jesus was 
the Christ. I knew that the prayers 
of those innocent children would be 
heard. And so it is, the prayers of 
our relatives and our loved ones, sus- 
tain us in any position. But when we 
return from abroad, perhaps we be- 
come negligent, and perhaps those who 
have been praying for us while abroad 
forget about us, and think it is not as 
important to pray for us at home as 
when we were away. But it is just as 
important. There are many tempta- 
tions here in Zion with which we have 
to battle as well as when we are in 
the world, because evil will come unto 
us, but we do not need to give it a 
resting place in .our lives. 

I think if the Word of Wisdom were 
more strictly taught among our peo- 
ple, there would be a good deal less 
sin; but how can we teach the Word 
of Wisdom among the people without 
first teaching them faith in God. You 
may teach a young man not to smoke 
tobacco or use stimulants in any way, 
but if he has not faith in God, you 
might as well talk to a post as to that 
young man. He must first have faith 
in God, and have a hope of a blessing 
and a reward through obedience 
to His laws. These are principles 
which I think at least the young 
Latter-day Saints should lay to heart. 
I think we should seek to keep those 
commandments which have been 
given to us. We should seek to keep 
the Word of Wisdom, because it has 
been revealed of God, and if we do we 
are made great promises. We are 
promised that we shall run and not 
be weary, and that we shall have 
health and strength given unto us. 
I believe if this commandment, the 
Word of Wisdom, were more strictly 
observed among the people, there 
would be less use for the physician 
or surgeon, that there would be less 
need for calling in a doctor for every 
trivial affair than there is today. 
We are willing to trust to God for the 
minor matters, but when something 
confronts us, which appears to be im- 
possible with us, then we will call in 
human aid, and thereby we show 



our lack of faith. It is true that all 
the assistance and all the skill that we 
can produce is necessary, perhaps, at 
times to remove the obstacles which lie 
in the way of nature, and I believe 
that it is the will of God that we 
should do all we can for ourselves, and 
then He will add His blessing. But 
many times we want to do it all our- 
selves, and do not want God to do any- 
thing at all. In other words, we trust 
in man more than we do in God. We 
have seen the example, many times, of 
people who have put their trust in 
certain men. We find that if those 
men fall, that if those men get into 
darkness, that their followers go with 
them. But God will never Pall. God is as 
eternal as the heavens. All who put 
their trust in God will never fall, if 
they continue. And we should trust 
this power, in great things as well as 
in minor affairs. So I think we should 
practice more the exercise of faith. I 
recollect reading in the closing part of 
the "Voice of Warning" comparisons 
which Apostle Parley P. Pratt has 
made between the doctrine taught by 
the Church of Christ and those held 
and practiced by the so-called Chris- 
tian world. I think today that he 
could line up a great many of those 
passages on one side, instead of put- 
ting them opposite each other. I 
think we fail in many ways in fol- 
lowing the things of God; and things 
which we have been in the habit of 
laying to the Christian world, so- 
called, I think we are practicing them 
ourselves; and we all know that there 
is need to perform in our own lives 
these things in which we believe. We 
cannot attempt to reform a body of 
people, or to promote their welfare, 
without taking an interest in them, 
and applying the principles to the in- 
dividual. We can assist each other in 
doing right. Two men who pledge 
themselves to their God and seek 
unitedly to do right are stronger, I 
believe, in carrying out such a resolve, 
and they have less difficulty in over- 
coming wrong. I have often thought 
that this, perhaps, was the reason why 
our Bord and Savior commanded His 
Apostles and Seventies to go out two 
by two. We find in the case of the 
Elders in traveling that way, that 
where at least one of them has implicit

faith in God, he is enabled to do a 
good missionary work in the interest of 
his companion, at least. 

May the blessings of God attend us. 
May we be zealous in defending that 
which we know to be good, and in 
defending the Zion of God. I testify to 
you, in the name of Jesus, that I have 
a testimony that what is called Mor- 
monism is the power of God unto sal- 
vation unto all who believe and obey. 
May God bless you, for Christ's sake. 
Amen. 

ELDER J. D. T. McAL LISTER. 

I have heard with pleasure the re- 
marks of our brethren who have min- 
istered unto us in this Conference. 1 
have been mellowed in my feelings, 
and the Spirit of the Lord has been 
made manifest. I have been especially 
interested and edified this morning in 
hearing our young brethren who have 
been called to the Apostleship. Their 
words to me were like living fire, to the 
young and rising generation, and they 
are true before the Lord, and should 
be listened to, not only by our young 
people but by those also who are fur- 
then advanced in life. We are here to 
do the Father's will. We are here to 
promote His cause. We are here to 
help mankind, and get them above the 
groveling ways that they 
have fallen into, and cause 
their minds and all that 
is within them to soar aloft and to 
receive more of that life that reaches 
into immortality, eternal life, and to 
enjoy the full blessings of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ and the ordinances of 
the house of God, for therein we have 
blessings for this life and the life to 
come. Therein we learn of His ways, 
we learn to walk in His paths. We 
receive that power and blessing, and 
the keys that are necessary to en- 
able us to understand and comprehend 
His will, His mind, and His word. 
To do this, we listen to the sweet 
whisperings of His Spirit, to the coun- 
sels of His servants who are minister- 
ing in the authority of the holy Priest- 
hood. I honor these men, because they 
honor God, and He honors them, be- 
cause of their faithfulness and their 
diligence, untiring in their work and 
labor, ministering day and night for 
the good of this people. I feel to cher- 
ish them and hold them up before God, 



our Eternal Father, that His choice 
blessings may be upon them continu- 
ally. It warms and cheers my heart 
to see our venerable President here 
with us, and so well; and I have seen 
him so sick, and almost near to death, 
raised up by the power of God and 
the good acts of his brethren. I am 
getting along a little bit in years. I 
have seen the travails of these men 
and their sacrifices for the good of this 
people, and I feel to bless them. I feel 
that within me which says, God bless 
these men, and if you so desire, say 
amen. (General response by the audi- 
ence of Amen). That is the way I 
feel about it. Peace be unto you and to 
all Israel, to all who love the truth, 
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG- 

A visit to the Irrigation Congress — Old land- 
marks—The Missionary field. 

My brethren and sisters, I was in- 
formed this afternoon when I first 
came into the building, that the breth- 
ren with whom I associate in the Coun- 
cil of the Seventies had had the honor 
and privilege of speaking this fore- 
noon; so I thought that they had done 
my part as well as theirs. Neverthe- 
less, I acknowledge that I am honored 
to stand before you in this vast as- 
sembly, and if I do not have the Spirit 
of the Lord to impress me with some- 
thing to say, my standing here will 
have been in vain; for without that in- 
fluence that comes from the Holy 
Spirit, as was truly said here yester- 
day, . no man can edify this vast con- 
gregation. 

I had the pleasure of visiting the Ir- 
rigation congress in the town of 
Lincoln, Nebraska. That is the town 
where the state prison is located, 
where my fellow laborer, Brother 
George Reynolds, was kept in durance 
vile for a short time for the Gospel's 
sake. I did not know the exact cell 
that he occupied, or I should have 
visited it. But I rejoice, for more than 
one reason, for the privilege of visit- 
ing the city of Lincoln. It lies about 
fifty miles from the main line of the 
Union Pacific, which is located on the 
old Pioneer road on which Brigham 
Young and his Pioneer band traveled 
on their way to Salt Lake valley fifty 
years ago. As I journeyed over the 
plains, I could locate many old camp- 
ing places that we used to stop at 
during our transit across these arid re- 
gions by mule and ox teams, years 
before the railroad was established. 



During our session of the Irrigation 
congress, no person from Idaho, or 
from Arizona, said anything about ir- 
rigation, and that was the avowed 
theme that we all expected to talk 
about, read about and write about dur- 
ing the congress. There seems to be an 
idea that irrigation started somewhere 
in the state of Ohio. I am not really 
informed as to whether they associate 
that fact (which is not a fact, how- 
ever,) with the original home of the 
Mormons in that state. Then they 
drift along the lines into Nebraska; 
and one of their foremost publications, 
after the coming congress had been 
located at the city of the plains, 
known as Cheyenne, published an item 
on the following morning to the ef- 
fect that it was a great mistake to hold 
the Irrigation congress at Cheyenne; 
it ought to have been located at Chica- 
go, the central place of the irrigation 
district, Cheyenne being on the extreme 
western limit of that district. The west- 
ern portion of the congress unitedly 
favored Cheyenne for the coming sea- 
son, where the congress will no doubt 
be held, as it was so decided by the 
congress ;andl believe that some idea of 
the irrigation system and the plan by 
which the pioneers and their followers 
were so successful in wringing bread 
and other necessaries of life from the 
desert region upon which they located, 
will no doubt be more fully understood 
or at least discussed in that congress. 
We had a very pleasant time, however, 
and were greeted with great kindness 
•and shown great respect, not only by 
the members of that congress, but by 
the citizens of Lincoln. The governor 
gave us a reception and ball the even- 
ing after my arrival, in which we were 
greeted and feted to our heart's con- 
tent. Nebraska's people are something 
like our own people: they evinced by 
their language and by their hearty 
welcome accorded to us the true west- 
ern hospitality. 

While there I hunted up the mission- 
ary headquarters of the Nebraska 
conference, and visited with the sis- 
ter who keeps the house and four of 
the Elders who are located in that dis- 
trict. I enjoyed myself very much in 
this association. I was invited very 
cordially to remain over a few days 
and attend their conference; but I had 



6o 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



a kind of longing to" be present at this 
greater gathering, and on that account, 
and some others of minor importance, 
I hurried home. 

I rejoice because I have a testimony 
to bear of the truth of the Gospel and 
of the organization of the Holy Priest- 
hood upon the earth, and seeing so 
many of my brethren and sisters to- 
gether this afternoon who, like myself, 
have the testimony and the witness for 
God in their hearts and shining 
through their countenances. By the 
spirit which is in the house, I judge 
that you have come together for the 
purpose of being fed and strengthened 
and built up in your most holy faith. 
I rejoice that we have had a great 
celebration during the Twenty-fourth 
of July and the days previous. A 
great deal of information concerning 
this people has been scattered abroad 
throughout this continent, especially 
the Avestern and the eastern states, 
through representatives which they 
had here — newspaper reporters and 
publishers, and prominent men — during 
that celebration; and the fame of the 
Latter-day Saints will continue to 
spread over the land. 

A gentleman asked me, during a re- 
cess of the congress, how many Elders 
we had in the missionary field. I told 
him that we had something more than 
twelve hundred at this present time. 
He said it would almost seem incred- 
ible that the Mormon people, so small 
in numbers as they were and so iso- 
lated as they had been for many years 
from their neighbors upon the East, 
could possibly have so many Elders in 
the field preaching the tenets of their 
faith. But I assured him it was a 
fact. He asked me how they were 
traveling, and how they were support- 
ed from day to day. I informed him 
that many of them traveled as did the 
ancient disciples and Apostles of the 
Lord Jesus, without purse and without 
scrip, trusting in the kindness of the 
people and in the spirit that prompted 
them, to win the hearts of those among 
whom they traveled, that they might 
be ministered unto, and be fed and 
clothed. The gentleman said that 
this was another feature of the disci- 
ples who associated with our Lord and 
Savior in His ministry, and one that 
was worthy of commendation in any 
religious denomination, and one which 



he thought was calculated to try 
the faith of those who traveled in this 
condition. I said that it did not re- 
quire the wealth of great religious de- 
nominations, or the wealth of individ- 
uals, to spread the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ; that one living witness, 
with a testimony of the truth in his 
heart, could go forth and win his way 
among the people, and preach the Gos- 
pel to thousands; and the few that 
would embrace these principles, in their 
turn became witnesses for God; ana 
the Gospel was continuously spread in 
this manner. Granting that to be true, 
said he, how much greater is your 
chance for spreading the Gospel with 
twelve hundred missionaries constantly 
in the field. 

I bear witness that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God; that the organi- 
zation of the Holy Priesthood is cor- 
rect and true today, and after the an- 
cient pattern; and that if we are faith- 
ful to the truth and to the trust com- 
mitted to us, we shall not fail of sal- 
vation; for the Lord has promised it to 
us, and He never fails. God bless you, 
my brethren and sisters, and increase 
your faith and your power to do good, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 

God is -with His people— The Purpose for which he 
has Gathered them— A Mission for All— No Work 
done for the Dead will be in Vain— The Earth and 
its Inhabitants to be Kedeemed. 

I have greatly enjoyed this Confer- 
ence. It has seemed to me that' the 
Spirit of the Lord has been poured 
out in great abundance upon the 
speakers and upon the hearers. At 
every meeting which we have held we 
have received valuable instruction, and 
the testimonies that have been borne 
to us concerning the work of God have 
been prompted and inspired by the 
Holy Spirit, and all the proceedings of 
this Conference have been joyful to 
me. I thank the Lord, in the midst of 
the congregation, that I have been 
permitted to be present and to enjoy 
the good spirit which has been poured 
out upon us. 

I also have a testimony to bear con- 
cerning this great work, and feel will- 
ing now, as I always have felt ever 
since I joined the Church in my boy- 
hood, to bear that testimony, in public 



ELDER C. W. PENROSE.

or in private, when called upon so to 
do. I know that this work is the work 
of the Lord. I know that God has been 
with His people from the organization 
of the Church to the present day. I 
know that His Spirit was not only 
with His servant Joseph, whom He 
called to lay the foundation of this 
work, but that it has been with those 
who have succeeded him. They have 
been prophets, seers and revelators, 
and the Lord has been with them. 
This work has not been built up by 
the power of man, by the learning of 
this world, by the riches and influence 
that come from the world, but it has 
been by the power of God. And I 
rejoice to know that that power is 
still with His servants and with His 
people, and that, notwithstanding our 
many failings and weaknesses and 
shortcomings — some of which have 
been pointed out during this Confer- 
ence — we are the people of the Lord; 
that He has gathered us from afar— 
from the east and the west, and the 
north and the south, and has brought 
us up here into these chambers of the 
mountains, that we may build up 
Zion, that we may help to establish 
righteousness in the earth, that we 
may be witnesses for God and for .the 
truth in the midst of an unbelieving 
generation. I feel very thankful in 
my soul for the testimony of Jesus 
which has been planted in my heart 
through obedience to the Gospel. God 
gave me this witness when I was a 
boy, when I came out from my friends 
and my associates and joined the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. He put His Spirit into my 
heart, and I thank God that it has 
never departed from me. The Lord has 
been with me, as with the rest of His 
servants, in traveling in the ministry; 
and I have seen His power made mani- 
fest in various ways. While I have 
been in this Conference, my mind has 
reverted to many things that occurred 
in my history in connection with the 
Church in the past, and in all these 
things I have had cause to rejoice, and 
to thank and praise the Lord. 

God has brought us here, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to these mountains 
not merely to gather around us the 
things of this world, to make us happy 
and comfortable temporally; but He 



has called us here with a mission to 
build up Zion, to publish the Cospel 
of peace to all nations, to gather His 
people, to establish His kingdom, to 
prepare the way for the coming of our 
Lord Jesus Christ to reign as King of 
Kings and Lord of Lords, and all the 
promises which God has made to us 
will be fulfilled. Every word that has 
been spoken under the influence ot His 
Spirit by His servants will come to 
pass. The blessings pronounced upon 
our heads when we were confirmed in- 
to the Church; the blessings promised 
to us by the Patriarchs when they 
laid their hands upon our heads and 
blessed us; the blessings promised to 
us in the House of the Lord — every 
word will be fulfilled; not one thing 
will fall to the ground. We may fail, 
and fall by the way, through our own 
follies and our own transgressions, and 
our own weaknesses and short- 
comings; but the work of God 
and the word of God will abide 
forever, and the kingdom and 
the greatness of the kingdom un- 
der the whole heavens will, as the 
prophet predicted, be given to the peo- 
ple of the Saints of the Most High — 
a people whom Christ will have pre- 
pared for His coming. 

We should take to heart the counsels 
which we have received while we have 
been gathered in this glorious Confer- 
ence, and carry them home with us, 
and, if our families have not been 
present, teach them to our households. 
The brethren who have come from 
distant points, who bear the Holy 
Priesthood, should carry home with 
them the spirit of this Conference and 
the teachings that have been given, 
and disseminate these things among 
the people, that the fire which has 
been kindled upon this altar may be 
taken to every part of the land of 
Zion, and the hearts of the righteous 
be made to rejoice. I know that it is 
a good thing for us to be in perfect 
harmony with those who preside over 
us in the Holy Priesthood — the officers 
in our wards, and in our Stakes, and 
with the Presidency and Apostles of 
the Church. The mind and will of the 
Lord is with them, and when we are 
in harmony with them we shall be in 
harmony with the powers that are on 
high. This is what God desires to ac- 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



complish on the earth — to bring a 
people to Him who shall be in har- 
mony with Him, in whom His Spirit 
can have free course and be gorified; 
a people who shall be sensitive to the 
whisperings and operations of His di- 
vine Spirit flowing down from His 
presence. For He designs to regener- 
ate and redeem the earth upon which 
we stand;' and we, His people, whom 
He has gathered from afar, are to be 
the instruments in His hands of bring- 
ing about this great work. The earth 
is to be redeemed, and all the in- 
habitants thereof; and our mission 
on earth is to labor with the Lord 
for the accomplishment of this pur- 
pose. And this should be first and 
foremost with us. All other things 
should be put aside as subordinate. Not 
that we need to cease from our ex- 
ertions to make ourselves happy and 
comfortable with the things that come 
from the earth — not by any means; 
but that these should be consecrated 
to the Lord; that all our efforts, all 
our exertions, should be with a view 
to building up Zion and establishing 
His glorious purposes in the earth; 
that we may help to save the sons and 
daughters of Adam — those that are 
living on the earth and those that 
have passed away and gone behind 
the veil. 

This is our work. To this God has 
called us. This is what we are here 
for. This is why we have been sent 
from the courts on high — our first 
birthplace — down on the earth. We 
are the children of God, and the Lord 
has called us to dwell on the earth in 
the later days, that we might work for 
Him and bring about this glorious pur- 
pose — the redemption of the earth and 
the inhabitants thereof. We are to 
preach the Gospel; we are to gather 
Israel; we are to go into the houses 
that have been prepared, to minister 
in behalf of our dead, that they may 
be redeemed. And we need not think 
that anything we do. there will fail, or 
be done for naught. It will all count. 
I have heard people say, "How do we 
know that the persons we are baptized 
for in the House of the Lord will ever 
have any benefit from our administra- 
tions? We do not know whether they 
will receive the Gospel. We do not 
know whether they will repent. Are 
we not working in the dark?" Not at 



all. The Lord has promised that the 
time shall come when "every knee 
shall bow and every tongue confess 
that Jesus is the Christ, to the glory 
of God the Father." So, then, our 
works performed vicariously in the 
House of God — our work for our dead 
— at some time will count. It will not 
be thrown away, if our friends who 
have gone before us into the spirit 
world do not immediately obey the 
Gospel. The time will come when they 
will be glad to receive it, and then the 
ordinances performed for them will 
stand to their good. As the Prophet 
Joseph declared, when he wrote on this 
subject, that which is recorded on the 
earth is recorded in the heavens, and 
though the books on the earth might 
be burned we shall find that a record 
is kept on high, and that in the 
heavenly archives the names of those 
who have been baptized for, and those 
who are baptized for them, will be 
written and will stand to the credit 
of those for whom these services have 
been performed. So that our work for 
our dead will abide and will stand, 
and the time will come when every one 
who is administered for will rejoice 
and be thankful that some good friend 
or relative has been in the House of 
the Lord on earth and ministered in 
his or her behalf. . 

This is a great work we are engaged 
in, and no tongue can tell its magni- 
tude. When our minds begin to open 
concerning it, we feel as though we 
could talk for a year about it, and 
then we could not tell all about it. 
It comprehends the salvation of all 
that can be saved on earth, the living 
and the dead; and then the redemption 
of the earth itself, its purification, its 
sanctification, that it may be brought 
up among the ransomed and redeemed 
worlds, and shine in its own glory, be- 
ing graced with the presence of its 
eternal Creator, where the ransomed 
of the Lord shall walk in white, where 
perfect harmony shall abound, and 
where every soul living shall praise 
the Lord, in the earth, around the 
earth, and under it, and in the sea, 
and all things that pertain to it will 
be filled with praise, with joy, and 
with glorious life. This is the work we 
are engaged in. We are called to this, 
my brethren. 

Now then, let us lay this to heart. 



ELDER C. W. PENROSE. 



63 



Let us be stirred up in our souls in 
regard to this great work that God has 
called us to. Not only has He called 
the Prophets and Apostles and leaders 
of the Church, but every man and every 
woman and every child born in Zion. 
We are all called with a holy calling. 
We are the Lord's people, and He has 
put this work upon us, and it is for us 
to do it. If we do, great shall be our 
joy, and eternal shall be our reward. 
You need not think that any good you 
do escapes the notice of Him on high, 
who shall be our Judge. Our acts are 
recorded. God understands us. He 
knows the motives that move us in 
our souls. He knows the intents of 
our hearts. And though we may some- 
times misjudge each other, we shall 
not be misjudged by the Almighty. 
He understands us, and He knows our 
failings, our weaknesses and our 
shortcomings. Now, let us see to it 
that we keep in view continually that 
we are God's people, that we must be 
different from the world, that God has 
called us out of the world, that we 
may be His people, and His servants, 
to build up Zion, to establish righteous- 
ness, to bring about all things pre- 
that are past. For, these are the times 
that are past. For these are the times 
of the restitution of all things; this is 
the time for the coming of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, our Elder Brother; this 
is the work preparatory to His coming. 

Now, let us unite in spirit. Let us put 
away from ourselves all things that 
offend, everything contrary to the 
genius and spirit of the Gospel and to 
the counsel and direction of the Lord; 
and let us look for light and intelli- 
gence to the sources that God Al- 
mighty has put in His Church for that 
purpose. I have been very much 
startled, quite recently, to know of 
people who are opposing certain 
movements simply because they un- 
derstand that the leading authorities 
of the Church want them. Just think 
of that now for a moment! The idea 
of men, holding the Priesthood too, op- 
posing a thing because they believe 
' that the authorities of the Church 
want it! What condition of mind 
must they be in? 

Brethren and sisters, let us take to 
heart the counsels that we have re- 
ceived in this Conference, and carry 



home the spirit with us. Let us re- 
member that God Almighty has estab- 
lished an order in His Church— the 
order of the Holy Priesthood— for the 
guidance of His people, that they may 
be one. They cannot be one unless 
they unite on this principle; and 
His Spirit will not be in 
their hearts to harmonize and unite 
them except they listen to the guides 
that God has placed to lead them in 
the path of life. These are important 
things. I know the time was in the 
Church when every man desired with 
his whole heart to find out what was 
wanted of the Lord through His ser- 
vants, and then he desired to accom- 
plish it. That should be the spirit 
dwelling in our hearts today. Do we 
not need guidance now as much as we 
ever did? Do we not need the hand 
of the Lord to lead us along and 
take us out of our difficulties— 
our financial troubles, our labor 
troubles, these social difficulties 
that are around us as well as around 
the world I say we do. We need the 
light of the Lord, the voice of the 
Lord; and God has placed in His 
Church, just as much today as He did 
anciently, 'Apostles and Prophets, 
Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, for 
the work of the ministry, for the per- 
fecting of the Saints, for the edifying 
of the body of Christ." If God has 
anything to reveal to this people as 
a Church, He will reveal it through 
the head, through the man that He 
has placed to hold the keys; and He 
will bless all His servants who are 
Prophets, Seers and Revelators with 
the spirit of their calling, if we up- 
hold and sustain them, not only by 
our faith and our prayers, but by our 
works. 

I desire with all my heart to be 
faithful and true to the Gospel, to en- 
dure to the end of my earthly career; 
and then I know I shall be safe 
when I get on the other side. I de- 
sire to do all I. can while I breathe the 
breath of life to build up this glorious 
work. I know of nothing that a man 
could be engaged in that is worth as 
much. My whole soul was in the 
Church when I came into it; I feel 
glad that I am the same today; that 
my heart is set to help to build up 
the kingdom of God in any way that

my services can be available. I thank 
God for the testimony of the truth. I 
thank God for the spirit that has been 
present at this Conference. I thank 
God that He has given me this wit- 
ness, and I desire to serve Him and 
keep His commandments, and to aid 
others in doing- so to the extent of my 
ability. May God bless this people, 
and may Zion grow and increase and 
spread abroad, and become the joy of 
the whole earth. I know that God 
will redeem His people. I know that 
Eden will bloom again. I know that 
Paradise will be restored. I know that 
Satan will be bound.with all his hosts, 
and that this earth, and the children 
of men that belong to it, will come 
forth from darkness and death, each 
in his place and time and season; and 
God will save His children, and He 
will glorify those who labor for 
righteousness, and crown them with 
eternal life and everlasting joy. God 
help us to be faithful, for Christ's 
sake. Amen.

Mission of the Saints — How Satan will be bound — 
Approaching Judgments — Wickedness of the 
world — Cleansing process in progress — Who are 
the children of God? — The Spirit of Revelation 
with the Church — Return of the Ten Tribes. 

The hopes and anticipations of the 
Latter-day Saints are probably dif- 
ferent from those of any other people 
in Christendom, if not in the world. 
We are looking forward, as Elder Pen- 
rose has said, to the time when prim- 
itive conditions will be restored; Avhen 
we shall have paradise on earth, when 
Eden will be restored to the earth, 
when Satan will be bound, when a 
reign of righteouness will be ushered 
in, when sin will be banished from the 
face of the earth, when what has 
been termed Millennial glory will be 
ushered in. We anticipate that this 
will be brought about not entirely by 
the Lord's intervention, but by man, 
directed by the Lord, laboring to ac- 
complish these results. I do not know 
any other people on the face of the 
earth who indulge in these anticipa- 
tions, or who expect these results to 
be brought about in the manner in 
which we do. It is generally thought 
that this will be done by the mani- 
festation of God's power, independent 



almost of human agency and effort; 
but we have been taught that we are 
the children of God, and that He works 
out His results by aiding His children, 
teaching them, and having them exer- 
cise their agency in the direction that 
He points out. This being the case, 
we should take to heart the instruc- 
tions we have received, and real- 
ize that the Lord has given unto us 
a mission, and that we are called upon 
to exert our utmost abilities to ac- 
complish the ends that have been 
predicted. I think if all of us would 
do this, and feel that the accomplish- 
ment of these results depends upon us, 
individually as well as collectively, it 
would have the effect to stimulate us 
and to stir us up to great diligence. 
I believe that those of us who will not 
labor to accomplish these ends will be 
removed from the midst of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. I do not believe that 
people can stay in this Church, as the 
end approaches, and remain inactive, 
indolent, indifferent, and sinful. God 
has called us to do this work; and 
when He calls men, as we have seen, 
to go on missions to accomplish cer- 
tain results in the preaching of the 
Gospel, if they do not labor in that 
mission as they should do, He takes 
His Spirit from them. So also, hav- 
ing this great mission assigned to us, 
and it being made incumbent upon us, 
and having received charge concern- 
ing it, if we do not seek to accomplish 
that mission, the Lord will withdraw 
His Holy Spirit from us. He will not 
permit us to go on and live lives of 
indifference and sinfulness in regard to 
His work. It is individual salvation 
that is to be accomplished. If I am 
saved, and if Satan is bound as .far 
as I am concerned, it must be by my 
doing that which God requires at my 
hands. God will not take away from 
me my agency. If I am determined to 
listen to Satan and to be influenced by 
his spirit, He will suffer me, in the 
exercise of my agency, to do that. 
But I must take the consequences of 
thus doing. We see that illustrated in 
the history of Abel and Cain. Cain* 
loved Satan more than God and he 
listened to him; he became the servant 
of Satan, to the extent of doing that 
which he required of him. Now, he 
could have done otherwise; he could 



PRESIDENT GEORGE O. CANNON. 



65 



have done as Abel did; but he chose 
to do differently, and he had to endure 
the consequences of his conduct. 

We talk about Satan being bound. 
Satan will be bound by the power of 
God; but he will be bound also by the 
determination of the people of God 
not to listen to him, not to be gov- 
erned by him. The Lord will not bind 
him and take his power from the earth 
while there are men and women will- 
ing to be governed by him. That is 
contrary to the plan of salvation. To 
deprive men of their agency is con- 
trary to the purposes of our God. 
There was a time on this continent, 
of which we have an account, when 
the people were so righteous that 
Satan did not have power among them. 
Nearly four generations passed away 
in righteousness. They lived in purity, 
and died without sin. That was 
through their refusal to yield to Satan. 
It is not recorded that Satan had no 
power in other parts of the earth 
daring that period. According to all 
history that we have in our posses- 
sion, Satan had the same power over 
men who were willing to listen to 
him. But in this land he did not have 
power, and he was literally bound. I 
believe that this will be the case in the 
millennium; and 1 reason upon it 
as I do upon that happy condition 
that is described in the record of 
which I speak. I expect that before 
Satan is fully bound the wicked will 
be destroyed. You are familiar with the 
history which the Book of Mormon 
gives of that period. There was a 
great destruction among the people. 
The Lord visited them in a most ter- 
rible manner. Dreadful calamities fell 
upon them, and the wicked were liter- 
ally wiped out, just as much as the 
antedeluvian world was wiped out by 
the flood. That wicked generation 
was completely extirpated, and those 
only were left who were righteous. I 
look forward to the same kind of 
destructions preceding the glorious 
events that will take place in the near 
future. The earth will be visited by 
fire. President Smith yesterday told 
us that "he that is tithed shall not be 
burned (at His coming.") I believe that 
there will be literal fire come upon the 
earth, and calamities and destruc- 
tions of so universal a character that 



the earth will be burned, so to speak, 
so that there will be but few men 
left. If the covering could be taken 
off our city, and of the cities of the 
world— I would not compare our city 
to many; but even if it were taken off 
our city, we who are here today would 
be appalled at the sight. The abomi- 
nations and secret wickedness that are 
practiced among the nations are in- 
truding themselves among us. Un- 
speakable practices are creeping in. 
They are varied in character. If we 
spoke of them at all, we would have to 
disguise their abominable character. 
In our own nation, and in the na- 
tions of the earth, there is a condition 
of things that, if we knew of it, 
would appall us. Let me allude to one 
instance. 

In England a short time ago a man 
who had posed in society as a man of 
culture and of taste, and who lectured 
upon esthetics, was found to be guilty 
of a most abominable crime — a crime 
for which under the old law the pen- 
alty was death; a crime which was 
practiced by the nations of old, and 
caused God to command their destruc- 
tion and extirpation. This crime was 
proved against this man, and some of 
his associates were what are called 
noblemen. He was sent to prison. His 
term of imprisonment having expired, 
he comes from prison, and is now en- 
gaged, it is so published, in writing a 
book, and, we suppose is received 
into society, though guilty of this 
nameless crime. And is this common? 
If we may believe that which is told 
to us, without going into researches 
ourselves, it and other kindred wicked- 
ness, is far too common. The same 
sin that caused the utter destruction 
of Sodom and Gomorrah! This and 
other abominable crimes are being 
practiced. How will these be stopped? 
Only by the destruction of those who 
practice them. Why, if a little nest of 
them were left that were guilty or 
these things, they would soon corrupt 
others, as some are being corrupted 
among us. In coming to these moun- 
tains we hoped to find a place where 
we could live secluded from the 
abominations of Babylon. But here 
in this secluded place wickedness in- 
trudes itself, and is practiced in this 
land which we have dedicated to the 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord as a land of Zion! How can this 
be stopped? Not while those who 
have knowledge of these filthy crimes 
exist. The only way, according to all 
that I can understand as the word 
of God, is for the Lord to wipe them 
out, that there will be none left to 
perpetuate the knowledge of these 
dreadful practices among the children 
of men. And God will do it, as sure 
as He has spoken by the mouths or 
His prophets. He will destroy the 
wicked, and those who will be left 
.will be like the Nephites after the 
wicked were all killed off; they were 
righteous men and women who lived 
for over two hundred years according 
to the law of heaven. 

The duty that devolves upon us is 
to live pure ourselves, and to have 
our children live lives of purity. There 
is too much looseness among us. 
Much as we are taught concerning 
virtue, we occasionally hear of acts 
that cause us the greatest pain — 
young people indulging in unvirtuous 
actions; children born two, three, and 
four months earlier than they should 
be. It is an extraordinary condition 
that the first children of some mar- 
riages are born sometimes five months 
and even less after marriage. This 
is an evidence of something very 
wrong. And this is not all. We can- 
not tell what is done in secret. This 
is made public, because the evidence 
of sin comes to light and cannot be 
concealed without the commission of 
more hideous crime. And this among 
a people such as we are! It is a dis- 
grace to us. Yet much of it is due to 
our neglect. Fathers and mothers do 
not pay that attention to their chil- 
dren, to their habits and their associa- 
tions, that they should do. If 
,hey watched them with care, 
and enquired of them where 
they went and with whom they 
associated, and threw safeguards 
around them, such things would not 
happen. There are conditions of 
society, even among other nations, 
where such things are very uncommon, 
because of the habits of the people. 
Fathers and mothers guard theii- 
daughters with the greatest circum- 
spection and vigilance. France is one 
of those nations. Although France is 
said to be a corrupt nation, the daugh- 



ters of the people are watched and 
their association with the other sex 
is guarded so that nothing of this 
kind scarcely ever happens. But with 
us there is too much familiarity be- 
tween the sexes. It is wrong; it leads 
to bad results. The commission of 
sin makes lives of unhappiness. No 
woman can forget the trespass of her 
husband, and no man can ever forget 
his own sin. It is painful through 
life for them to think about. We 
should, as a people, guard against 
these things. All sorts of evils are 
introducing themselves. We have 
men here with whom a woman can no 
more be trusted than she could be in 
the den of a wolf — and men of res- 
pectable appearance, and who act as 
though they might be gentlemen. 
Parents would be as safe in trusting 
a daughter to a wild beast as to one 
of them. This class of men prey upon 
the other sex, and have brought 
themselves to think that it is neither 
sinful nor wrong. They destroy 
virtue wherever they can, and take 
pride in it. They do not believe there 
need be any virtue among men, and 
all women whom they can induce to 
comply with their wishes they view 
as their lawful prey. And these peo- 
ple come among us, and consort with 
us! Our young men, too, consort with 
them, and some of them take lessons 
from them. We have heard lately of 
an occurrence of this character that 
has stirred our souls to the very cen- 
ter. 

When will these things end? When 
God visits the wicked with His judg- 
ments, as He will do. Then these 
practices and the wicked and the 
knowledge of their wickedness, will be 
destroyed. Then, I hope, the filthy 
details and the exact forms and 
methods of these abominations will 
be kept secret, as the Prophet Alma 
counseled his son Helaman concern- 
ing the secret oaths and covenants 
of the Jaredites, that had come down 
from the days of Master Mahan, of 
whom we read in the new transla- 
tion, and who was the head of that 
secret organization that banded 
themselves together to commit mur- 
ders and works of darkness. Alma said 
to Helaman: 



F RESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



67 



"Therefore ye shall keep these secret 
plans of their oaths and their cove- 
nants from this people, and only their 
wickedness, and their murders, and 
their abominations, shall ye make 
known unto them; and ye shall teach 
them to abhor such wickedness, and 
abominations, and murders; and ye 
shall also teach them, that these peo- 
ple were destroyed on account of their 
wickedness, and abominations, and 
their murders." 

So, I trust, it will be with us. The 
knowledge of the wicked and their 
destruction will be preserved in our 
midst; but the abomination and the 
wickedness itself will be concealed 
from human knowledge, so that wick- 
edness may be abolished in the earth, 
and the reign of righteousness be 
ushered in. 

My brethren and sisters, in talking 
in this strain I am not indulging in 
any theory. I do not wish to deal in 
the least exaggeration concerning 
conditions that exist. My duties have 
called me to mingle with the world 
considerably; but I have avoided 
knowledge of things that were open 
to me if I had chosen to look at them 
or to enquire about them. Notwith- 
standing this, it has been impossible 
for me to avoid knowing considerable 
about many wicked practices, and how 
little of sin is attached to them by the 
people of the world. It is this that is 
the fearful feature in society. Men 
may seduce; men may be guilty of 
vileness; men may get disreputable 
names for their association with the 
other sex; and yet society will re- 
ceive them and condone their offenses; 
in fact, it has seemed to me sometimes 
as though men of this character, with 
a certain class of women, were more 
attractive than pure, modest, diflldent 
men. They seem to think more of them 
because of the fame they have 
achieved in their conquests of virtue. 
But a poor girl that falls in such a 
way, she is trampled in the dust and 
becomes a lost soul! And her own sex, 
while admiring the seducer and receiv- 
ing him into their society, will fre- 
quently be the most fierce and vehe- 
ment in their denunciations of their 
poor sister who has fallen by the wiles 
and seductive influences of the man. 
Now, all this is wrong. Yet this feel- 
ing is among us to some extent, also. 
Men ought to be held, and I believe 



the Lord does hold them 111 such 
cases, to a far stricter accountability 
than he does women. The woman has 
her own passions to contend against; 
but when she has the man's impor- 
tunities added to these, shall not the 
woman be viewed with mercy, and be 
looked upon differently ,to that vile 
creature who, possessed of strength 
and power, adds his importunities to 
her weakness and overcomes her, and 
makes her the victim of his unholy 
lust? I say, Yes, Yes! Such men will 
be damned; and if there is any deeper 
damnation than another, they will be 
consigned to it. 

Now, if we want our generations 
to live in the earth, and to have them 
go down through the thousand years; 
if we want to have representatives 
among the children of men during 
that happy period, we have to lay the 
foundation for that now. As we have 
been told during this Conference, the 
day of the Lord cometh: it is near at 
hand; and if we and our children live, 
it will be because we try to be pure. 
No generation from this time forth 
can live for any length of time unless 
they are pure; for God has said it, 
and His word does not return unful- 
filled. Even now you can see how this 
Church is being cleansed as we go 
along. Look at the families that we 
have known in the Church, and see 
how they are being thinned out, just 
as though we were passing through a 
sifting machine. And when we see how 
few of those whom we have known 
have clung to the iron rod and main- 
tained their faith, we are led to ask, 
who then can be saved? Then how 
many families there are who, after 
the death of the father and mother, 
are not numbered among the Saints 
of God! This is a cleansing process 
which is going on, and it will continue 
to go on more and more, because we 
are advancing. The Lord will hold us 
to a stricter accountability than He 
ever has done, because we have more 
light, and because of the near ap- 
proach of the end. The end does ap- 
proach, and the Lord Jesus will come 
in the clouds of heaven, as has been 
predicted, and He will reign on the 
earth, and over a pure people. His peo- 
ple will be cleansed and made pure 
by the destruction of the wicked and

the preservation of the righteous. That 
is the reason every wise man and 
woman observes the Word of Wisdom. 
They want to live and be preserved 
when these calamities and judgments 
shall sweep through the earth. We 
ought not to have to preach it for a 
minute among a people such as we are. 
Every man and woman should be 
determined to keep that Word, that 
they may have the blessing, that they 
and their children may live and not 
be killed with pestilence and sickness. 
Such persons will desire every child 
of theirs to avoid violating the coun- 
sel of God in these things. Thoy will 
also say, besides observing the Word 
of Wisdom: "I want to pay my tithing. 
I expect there will be a burning some 
day, and I want to be preserved when 
the day of burning comes. I want to 
keep the law that will bring the ful- 
fillment of the promises of God." 
Should not we here in this year 1897, 
live in this way? 

Many have supposed that by this 
time the Lord would have come in 
His glory. He has not yet come in that 
manner. But He is coming, and His 
■coming is near at hand. Therefore, 
we should each endeavor to live so 
that we shall be prepared for His com- 
ing; Ave should prepare the way by 
keeping His commandments and liv- 
ing so that Satan will be bound, so 
far as we and our families are con- 
cerned. It is incumbent upon us that 
we should live this way; for the Lord 
will not, I can assure you • CI speak 
having knowledge upon this point), al- 
ways bear with us. Elders cannot wear 
themselves out as they have done in 
the past, and as they are still doing, 
in preaching the word ' of God to this 
people, and the Lord not hold tho peo- 
ple accountable for their disobedience, 
if they reject that word. The Lord will 
have a pure people. He will have a 
people whose hearts are changed. 

Some religious societies, you know, 
believe altogether in faith as the only 
essential to salvation. On the other 
hand, I have heard some of our Elders 
go to the other extreme and almost 
look upon work as being all that is 
necessary, because of the saying of 
James. But the word of God which we 
have teaches us that we must 
be born again, and our hearts must be 



changed, and every evil desire crushed 
out. Our whole natures should be 
changed by the operations of the 
Spirit of God and the principles of the 
Gospel. I think it was Brother Cow- 
ley who spoke concerning some apos- 
tates whom they found while laboi'ing 
in the mission field in Missouri. When 
they belonged to the Church they had 
not received and enjoyed the Spirit of 
God. There are some probably here 
today who have never had their hearts 
changed, never had new desires, never 
been converted from their old de- 
sires, and the "old man" is with them 
still. There have been people whom, 
probably, we have all known, who 
would cheat, and lie, and get drunk, 
and do other evil things, just as much 
as if they never had been brought 
into the Church of Christ. Are these 
the children of God? No; God does 
not own such people. When men and 
women join the Church in sincerity, 
they repent of their sins, and they 
have new desires. The desire to Jo 
evil is taken from them. The Spirit 
of God will not dwell in a man that 
has evil desires and does not try to 
quench them. We as a people -rhould 
seek to be converted in this respect, if 
we have not been. If we are as wicked 
and have as wicked inclinations 
since our baptism and our association 
with the Church as we had before, 
then we need to be converted and be 
born again. 

We hear a good deal of talk about 
re-baptism, and the First Presidency 
and the Twelve have felt that so 
much re-baptism ought to be stopped. 
Men, when they commit sin, think 
if they can only get the Bishop to re- 
baptize them, they are all right and 
their sins are condoned. It is a falla- 
cy; it will lead to destruction. There 
is no such thing in the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. It is repentance 
from sin that will save you, not re- 
baptism. If you have been baptized, 
then, if you commit sin, repent of the 
sin, confess it, and make the confes- 
sion as broad as the knowledge of the 
sin; confess it to your brethren and 
sisters, and ask their forgiveness; 
and do not imagine that when you 
commit sin you can slip into the 
waters of baptism and you are all 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



69 



right again. Do not delude your- 
selves, brethren and sisters. Sinners, 
be not deceived by such a fallacy. 
Something more than this is neces- 
sary. "We need to repent of our sins, 
and to confess them to God. We need 
to come before the Lord with broken 
hearts and contrite spirits, and be- 
fore the Church with the spirit of 
confession. We should not be afraid 
to confess our sins; for there is no 
man among us that is not a sinner. 
Of course, there are different degrees 
of sin, and there is a difference in the 
degrees; but no man or woman, in 
listening to the confession of another, 
need pride himself or herself and say, 
"I am not a sinner. Here is this poor 
creature, a sinner; oh, how I pity 
him!" If we come to God m humility, 
He will show unto us our sins, and our 
imperfections, and our faults; and we 
will feel merciful to our brethren and 
sisters who, like ourselves, are weak 
and erring. We will be full of pity 
for them, and we will forgive them. 
This is the feeling that should exist in 
every bosom when men and women 
who commit sin come and confess 
their sins and are humble and con- 
trite. When Latter-day Saints hear 
such things, there is a feeling of pity 
wells up in their hearts, and their 
souls overflow with sympathy, and 
they say, "Yes, yes, we'll forgive you, 
and we'll try and forget all about it. 
Go on, dear brother, (or sister) repent, 
and do better from this time forward, 
and we will give you our faith and 
prayers." That is the way Saints 
should feel when their brethren and 
sisters commit sin and repent of it. 

The Lord, also, is moved with com- 
passion; the angels are moved with 
mercy and sympathy; and the Lord 
Jesus, who stands as a Mediator be- 
tween our Father and ourselves, is 
filled with compassion for His 
brethren and sisters when they com- 
mit sin and repent of it. Oh! all 
heaven is moved by the repentance of 
a sinner, and stirred up with a desire 
to help the poor creature who con- 
fesses his sins and repents truly and 
sincerely. 

Brethren and sisters, now that this 
Conference is drawing to a close, let 
us endeavor to profit by the teachings 
we have heard. I have been gladdened 



during this Conference over one thing. 
I believe the nomination of the two 
brethren who are appointed to fill the 
vacancies in the quorum of the 
Apostles came as a surprise to the 
community, if not to the Saints. 1 
have not seen what the papers have 
said at different times; but I un- 
derstand they have been picking and 
choosing and mentioning the name 
of every man that is at all conspicu- 
ous in the Church, as likely to be 
chosen. It is evident that the Lord 
did not tell them anything. Since 
these names were presented yester- 
day I have had several come to me 
and tell me that the Lord had re- 
vealed to them that these men would 
be chosen. One man said to me that 
last April, when they were presenting 
the names of the authorities in the 
Stake to which he belongs, it was 
made manifest to him that Matthias 
F. Cowley would be one of the Twelve 
Apostles. He said so to his com- 
panions, and told them to write it 
down, as it would be fulfilled. Sev- 
eral instances of this kind have come 
to my knowledge. I have not mingled 
much with the people, because wo 
have been so busy; but I have been 
gratified beyond expression to learn 
from these instances that the Lord is a 
God of revelation, not to the First 
Presidency and the Twelve alone, but 
that the Latter-day Saints as a people 
have the spirit of revelation. It is a 
blessed thing to live in an age when 
God reveals His mind and will to 
those who seek for it. It is not al- 
ways that we have everything told to 
us; but when we want to get light 
upon any subject, the Lord has pro- 
vided the way. He is a God that hears 
and answers prayers. He does not 
conceal Himself. I am thankful that 
we are not as Israel was in the days 
of Elijah. The prophets of Baal cried 
aloud, jumped upon their altar, cut 
themselves with knives, and indulged 
in all sorts of extravagances to reach 
the ear of their god, while Elijah 
taunted them and said, perhaps he was 
asleep or had gone on a journey. 
That is the condition of the world to 
a great extent. I speak this without 
intending any disrespect, because 
there are just as good people in the 
world as we are; but I say it because 



7o 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there is no revelation among- them, 
nor any idea that it can be obtained, 
and therefore, men call in vain when 
they do call; though there are honest 
souls who believe the Lord will hear 
their prayers, and whom He does 
hear. When the Prophet Elijah called 
our God heard and answered him. 
So it is with this Church. It is the 
Church of Jesus Christ, and when its 
members call upon God they get 
revelation from God, according to their 
faith and diligence and the responsi- 
bility that rests upon them. As I said 
last night at the Priesthood meeting, 
there has never been one minute since 
this Church was organized that it has 
been destitute of the knowledge of God 
and the voice of God. The will of God 
could be obtained; it has been ob- 
tained. And the Church will never be 
left without it. The authority is in 
the Church to lead it, as Brother 
Reynolds said. The angels and heads 
of dispensations that have been upon 
the earth have come and restored the 
keys they held and bestowed them 
upon the Prophet Joseph Smith; and 
he sealed them upon the Apostles. 
The same authority, the same keys, 
the same power that had been con- 
ferred upon him, he transmitted in 
their fullness to the Twelve Apostles. 
In this way the keys and that au- 
thority have been preserved pure and 
in the fullness of their power on the 
earth, and are here in the midst of 
this people. In this respect we stand 
at the head. 

It is written that the ten tribes will 
come forth from the north country, 
and they will come here to those who 
hold the keys in this dspensation, to 
receive the blessings they do not have 
themselves. Here is Ephraim, and 
Ephraim holds the keys. The ten 
tribes are there, but the authority to 
hold the keys is here. God is doing a 
mighty work among the nations of 
the earth, unknown to us to a great 
extent. Powerful a.gencies are operat- 
ing under His direction in all the na- 
tions, to bring to pass the fulfillment 
of His designs. While this is all going 
on, and we may seem only like a little 
handful in the midst of the millions of 
the earth, here in the midst of this 
people the authority is held which God 
recognizes, and here are the keys by 
which the purposes of God will be ful- 



filled. ' All that has been spoken by 
the mouths of the holy Prophets will 
be accomplished. There will be a high- 
way cast up; the ten tribes will re- 
turn, and they will come to the chil- 
dren of Ephraim to receive their bless- 
ings. 

There is everything, therefore, to 
encourage us. Let us live so that we 
shall be heirs and recipients of these 
great blessings. Let us endeavor to 
have our families live so that we 
shall be prepared for the coming of the 
Lord; that we will not listen to Satan, 
that our children will turn a deaf ear 
to his persuasions, and that we our- 
selves will set them the example; that 
we will teach them to remember, above 
all things, to never commit any sin 
that will cause them to lose their 
standing in the Church of Christ. 

God bless you all, bless everyone 
who has attended this Conference, and 
fill us with the Holy Ghost, and help 
us to do right. God bless our beloved 
President Wilford Woodruff. God be 
praised! He has heard the prayers of 
His servants and people in His behalf, 
that his life might be preserved, and 
he is with us today, filled with a 
vigor — considering his age and his 
sickness — that is really astonishing. 
God bless him, and bless all that per- 
tains to him, and preserve him. We 
would like to have him live forever, if 
we could. God bless you all, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRE ST. WILFORD WOODRUFF. 

CLOSING REMARKS. 

It is time to close this conference; 
but before closing I want to say a few 
words to the Latter-day Saints. I have 
attended conferences under the presi- 
dency of Joseph Smith during his life 
time, from 1833; I have attended con- 
ferences under President Brigham 
Young nearly forty years, from the 
time of the death of Joseph Smith un- 
til his own death; I have attended 
conferences under the presidency of 
John Taylor, and I have attended 
conferences as President of the Church 
myself since that period. That re- 
sponsibility has rested upon me, and 
rests upon me today. Sixty-four 
years of my life have passed away as 
a member of this Church. I do not 
know that I shall ever address you 



PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.

again; I cannot tell anything about 
this; but I feel strongly impressed to 
say a few words to you upon prin- 
ciple, although it is late. 

I want these Latter-day Saints to 
lay to heart what has been said to you 
by the Apostles and Elders who have 
spoken at this Conference. I want 
to say another thing. I prophesy, in 
the name of Israel's God, the day has 
come when the mouths of Wilford 
Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, Joseph 
F. Smith, and these Twelve Apostles, 
should not be closed because of the 
opinions of the children of men. There 
have been feelings that these men 
holding high positions — the Twelve 
Apostles and Presidency — should say 
nothing about politics. I want to say 
to you here, the day has come when 
God Almighty requires at your hands 
to unite together in your temporal 
business, and in your politics, so far 
as it is wisdom. I do not care whether 
a man is a Republican or a Democrat, 
in that he is free; but it is your duty 
to unite in electing good men to gov- 
ern and control your cities, your local 
affairs, and I will state that when you 
do not do this you are losers of the 
blessings of Almighty God. I 
want to tell you this upon 
this occasion. My mouth shall 
not be closed upon these 
principles. I know it is the duty of the 
Latter-day Saints to unite together 
in your local affairs, the election of 
your city councils, the election of men 
to act for you in the affairs of state. 
Lay aside your extremes in democ- 
racy and republicanism, as far as is 
wise in that matter, and in other than 
local matters as Latter-day Saints 



unite together within your party lines 
and appoint good men. When you do 
that, God will bless you. You won't 
all be taxed to death and lose your 
property, if you will appoint good men 
and pursue this course. 

I take the liberty, as President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, of making these remarks. No 
matter what the feelings of men may 
be towards me; I shall not stay in this 
country very long. But I realize 
very well that this people are groaning 
under poverty, under affliction, under 
taxation, and in positions that they 
ought not to be if they would. only unite 
together and do their duty. And this 
idea of a person being afraid of some- 
body because he is a Democrat or a 
Republican, it is all wrong. I feel 
like saying to you, as the President 
of this Church, and do state, that it 
is your duty to unite together and ap- 
point good men to act in every capac- 
ity for the public welfare. Therefore 
let us do our duty, walk uprightly be- 
fore the Lord our God, and leave the 
consequences with Him. "Do what ic 
right, let the consequences follow;" 
which may God grant, for Christ's 
sake. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, The 
nations bow to Satan's thrall. 

Benediction by Patriarch John 
Smith. 

Conference adjourned for six 
months.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Semi-Annual General Conference. 



The semi-annual meeting of the Des- 
eret Sunday School Union convened in 
the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sun- 
day, October 3, 1897, at 7 p. m. In ad- 
dition to the general superintendency, 
there were present nearly all the mem- 
bers of the Union board, many leading 
Church authorities and a large repre- 
sentation of earnest Sunday school 
workers. The meeting was called to 
order by Assistant General Superin- 
tendent George Goddard. 

The Tabernacle choir sang: "Hark! 
Listen to the Trumpeters." 

Elder George Teasdale offered the 
opening prayer and the choir sang, 
"Glory and Love to Men of Old." 

Elder John M. Whitaker, the gen- 
eral secretary, called the roll of 
Stakes, and presented the general Sun- 
day school authorities, who were 
unanimously sustained as follows: 
George Q. Cannon, general superin- 
tendent; George Goddard, first assis- 
tant superintendent; Karl G. Maeser, 
second assistant superintendent; George 
Reynolds, general treasurer; as mem- 
bers of the Deseret Sunday School 
Union Board, George Q. Cannon, 
George Goddard, Karl G. Maeser, 
George Reynolds, Thos. C. Griggs, Jos. 
W. Summerhays, Levi W. Richards, 
Francis M. Lyman, Heber J. Grant, 
Jos. M. Tanner, George Teasdale, Hugh 
J. Cannon and Andrew Kimball. 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon stated that it was due to 
Elder John C. Cutler that an explana- 
tion be made as to the reason why 
his name was not presented as a mem- 
ber of the Union Board. Elder Cutler 
has a great many duties to perform, 
and has recently been called to the 
Bishopric of one of the wards; and this, 
with many other labors, prevents his 
attending to the duties of a member 
of the board and it was therefore, at 
his request, partially, and with great 
reluctance on the part of the Union 
Board, that he was allowed to with- 
draw. But it is expected that he will 
remain an honorary member, and 



when opportunities present themselves, 
attend the Sunday school conferences. 
Brother Andrew Kimball has been se- 
lected to fill the vacancy caused by 
Brother Cutler's resignation. Elder 
John M. "Whitaker then read the fol- 
lowing circular letter: 

"Salt Lake City, Utah, 

April 1, 1897. 
To Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, and 
Stake Superintendents of Sunday 
Schools: 

Dear Brethren. — Members of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union Board 
have had the pleasure, during the past 
two years, of attending annual Sun- 
day school conferences in the thirty- 
seven Stakes of Zion. During these 
visits they have had much satisfaction 
in meeting with several thousand offi- 
cers and teachers, who are faithful 
fellow-laborers in the great Sunday 
school cause. The great majority of 
them, we are pleased to learn, are ob- 
servers of the Word of "Wisdom. God 
bless them. 

We indulge the hope that the time is 
not far distant when it can be truth- 
fully said, that all the teachers of our 
hundred thousand children are not 
only keeping and teaching the Word 
of Wisdom, but other principles of the 
Gospel, such as honoring the Sabbath 
day, sustaining the Priesthood, and 
observing the law of tithing, etc. 

To aid you in attaining so desirable 
a consummation, we suggest that 
when vacancies occur in any of our 
Sunday school organizations, these 
vacancies be filled, as far as prac- 
ticable, by those who practice and 
teach the above mentioned principles. 

By observing this simple and con- 
siderate method, glorious results will 
soon follow, without the least dis- 
turbance of any of our present co- 
laborers. What a delightful begin- 
ning of the millennial reign of our 
Savior on the earth it will be for the 
scores of thousands of our Sunday 
school teachers and children to be- 
come practical observers of the above 
named principles! Let us earnestly 
strive to fortify our children to resist 
the many temptations and allurements 
of the enemy. 

Tour Brethren, 
GEORGE Q. CANNON, 
GEORGE GODDARD, 
KARL G. MAESER. 
General Superintendency of Sunday 
Schools."

Assistant Supt. George Goddard said 
he remembered forty-eight years ago 
when all the Sunday school children be- 
longing to the Latter-day Saints 
could be accommodated in a room lOx 
15; now it would require eight such 
tabernacles as the one in which the 
meeting was being held to accommo- 
date all who were earnest, faithful 
Sunday school workers. He con- 
sidered this a wonderful change, but 
looked forward with bright anticipa- 
tion for a greater increase in the same 
length of time in the future. He 
spoke of the pleasure members of the 
board had in attending the thirty-six 
annual Sunday school Stake confer- 
ences since April last, and noted with 
pleasure the rapid growth and interest 
in this work. To further help the offi- 
cers and teachers he referred to the 
following list of questions, regarding 
the conducting of Sunday schools, 
that have been sent to each 
school for their guidance, and trusted 
that close attention would be paid to 
them by all, in attaining the 
object so much desired. Elder 
Goddard called attention to the 
importance of using the little Sun- 
day school hymn book, and of all tak- 
ing part in all the songs of the school. 
He stated that Elder John M. Whit- 
aker, who had been a faithful secre- 
tary now for about nine years, had 
been called to take a mission to the 
Eastern States, and all communica- 
tions for the Union board should for 
the present be sent to General Secre- 
tary Deseret Sunday School Union 
Board. 

LIST OF QUESTIONS. 

"Superintendents will please report 
on the following questions at the an- 
nual Sunday school conference of their 
Stake in the year 1898: 

Do your school exercises begin at 
10 a. m.? 

Have most of the children Sunday 
school hymn books? 

Do all the children rise and sing in 
concert? 

Is the Sacrament properly admin- 
istered ? 

Have all the children over eight 
years old been baptized? 

Is your school properly graded? 

Do each of your teachers own q 
treatise and study it? 



How often do you hold teachers' 
meetings? 

Do all the officers pay tithing, and 
is it taught in the Sunday school? 

Do all abstain from tea, coffee, to- 
bacco and strong drink? 

How many of the school officers take 
the Juvenile Instructor, and are there 
any for the use of the school? 

Do you strictly honor Nickel Day? 

Do you observe the Monthly Past, 
and is it taught? 

Does your school use the Leaflets? 

Do you try to get all the children in 
your ward enrolled, and look after ab- 
sentees? 

Do you sustain the general and local 
Church authorities by your votes and 
acts? 

How many are there in your ward 
who should, but do not, attend Sun- 
day school? 

How many names have you enrolled 
on your record? 

What is your average attendance of 
teachers and pupils?" 

Elder George Reynolds called atten- 
tion to the distribution of Nickel En- 
velopes to be used on the 31st of Octo- 
ber this year in collecting the "Nickel 
Fund." If enough had not been sent to 
the schools, by application to the secre- 
tary, they could have the number re- 
quired. It was desirable, he said, that 
this fund be sent immediately after its 
collection, in the most convenient form 
to him, as general treasurer, but not in 
the envelopes as some had done in 
the past. In regard to the leaflets,Elder 
Reynolds stated that thirty-two num- 
bers had already been sent to the 
schools, and the other eight, making 
the forty promised for 1897, would 
soon be sent. These were on Bible 
subjects. He regretted that in some 
schools no use was made of these im- 
portant lessons; in others they were 
used perhaps once and laid around, 
wasted, or destroyed. He urged that 
they be taken great care of, used as 
they are intended, and much good 
would follow. 

It had been deemed wise, should 
the authorities of any of the 
Stakes prefer to have their annual 
Sunday school conference between 
now and April, 1898, to so hold them. 
The Stakes desiring this should at 
once notify the board, and if on the 
dates set, members of the board can 



74 



DESERET SbNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



attend, the Stake authorities will be 
promptly notified. He also called at- 
tention to the importance of every 
school at least, and as many officers 
and teachers as possible, taking the 
official organ of the Sunday school, 
the Juvenile Instructor; for, on many 
occasions.questions had been asked and 
information sought by letter, that had 
been fully answered in that paper. 

Elder T. C. Griggs called attention 
to the following items: 
. First— The Stake Sunday school 
Visiting Book, in which visits 
to various Sunday schools of 
their respective Stakes are to be ful- 
ly recorded, should be brought to the 
annual Sunday school conferences to 
be inspected by the mem- 
bers of the board; and at the 
close of the present year, should 
be fully made up and sent to the 
General Secretary to be examined by 
the board. 

Second— The necessity of Stake 
superintendents carefully looking after 
the organization of branch Sunday 
schools in remote parts of their Stakes 
and fostering the same, thus enabling 
all the Sunday school children to at- 
tend without going too far from their 
homes. These branch schools might 
be organized and maintained for a 
time as a part of the ward school; and 
one of the school superintendency 
of that school could attend each Sun- 
day and aid in the conduct of the 
branch school until it is able to take 
care of itself. 

Third— The questions and answers 
on General Church Authorities should 
be carefully studied and made a special 
feature of the 1898 annual Sunday 
school Stake conferences. 

Elder John Robinson sang the solo, 

"Grant us, Oh Lord, Thy Peace." 

Elder Jos. W. Summerhays alluded 
to the importance to each Sunday 
school obtaining one of the New Bible 
charts, attention to which had al- 
ready been called by a cir- 
cular to each school. Regarding 
the Book of Mormon Chart No. 
2, he stated that it was now being 
printed, and would shortly be ready 
for distribution. One copy will be sent 
free to each school. 

Assistant General Superintendent 
Karl G. Maeser stated that in visit- 
ing the various annual Sunday school 



conferences during the present year, 
the members of the Union board found 
a lack of comprehension in class ex- 
ercises rendered on such occasions. 
It was intended that at these gather- 
ings the very best class work in the 
Stake should take part so that others 
teaching the same department could 
profit by the exercise; and he sug- 
gested to Stake superintendents, as 
they visit the various schools, to note 
the best class work done in the vari- 
ous departments, best leaflet exercises, 
singing, etc., and when preparing a 
program for the coming annual Sun- 
day school conferences make it up 
from these. For example, a primary 
exercise from one school, a first inter- 
mediate department exercise from an- 
other, etc., having the best in every 
case, that others teaching the same de- 
partments may be benefited. 

Elder Maeser recommended that not 
more than eight or ten at most from 
these representative classes be se- 
lected to render the exercise at the 
conferences, and those selected should 
be drilled to speak clearly and dis- 
tinctly so that all might hear. He sug- 
gested further that arrangements 
might be made by the ward superin- 
tendents, with the Bishops, to convey 
those thus selected to the conference, 
and believed if this plan were followed, 
the annual Sunday school conferences 
would accomplish one of the special 
objects of their establishment, viz.: 
bringing together the best class work 
in the Stake for the benefit of all in- 
terested. 

PRE ST- GEORGE Q CANNON 
There has been a small book pub- 
lished by the Deseret Sunday School 
Union called "The S. S. Treatise." I 
find on page seventy-four (74) in that 
little work suggestions concerning the 
lessons to be taught to the Theological 
class, which I now read: 

"In treating of the call of Abraham, 
show how the people had fallen into 
idolatry, and the design God had in 
calling him from his father's house." 
The next sentence says: "Take up the 
founders of the Chaldean and Egyp- 
tian empires. Follow the growth and 
decay of these and succeeding na- 
tions as you proceed." 

Our attention has been called to 
the fact that in some of the Sunday 
schools, there is considerable atten- 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



75 



tion devoted to questions like these I 
have read — "Take up the founders of 
the Chaldean and Egyptian empires. 
Follow the growth and decay of these 
and succeeeding nations as you pro- 
ceed." 

I have been told that in some of our 
schools this has been followed to 
a very great extent and far beyond 
that which was designed in the get- 
ting up of this Treatise. I might 
read from page 80 — I have just hap- 
pened to turn to that. I see here is a 
subject: "The wars between, and 
persecutions of the Catholics and 
Protestants by each other." And then 
a little afterwards, "Give a sketch of 
the United States government, etc." 
^ Some of our teachers are pleased to 
dwell considerably upon the history 
of these different nations, and the re- 
sult is that some of the lessons are 
so devoted to what may be called pro- 
fane history, that is, ancient his- 
tory, that there is very little 
said about the Gospel, and very little 
said about the Lord. 

OBJECT OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 

I think this is an error, and such 
lessons as these should not be carried 
too far. Our Sunday schools are for 
the purpose of teaching our children 
the principles of the Gospel. We must 
not make our Sunday schools too much 
like district schools. That is not the 
purpose. The Sunday schools are to be 
entirely devoted to the teaching of the 
principles of the Gospel. We want to 
make Latter-day Saints of our chil- 
dren. If I send a child to Sunday school 
I want that child taught the Gospel. 
He can read and learn history, and 
a great many other things outside of 
the Sunday school, that ought not to 
be taught in the Sunday school. In 
the Sunday schools we should confine 
our labors to the object for which they 
have been established. 

I was speaking today in our meeting 
of the Sunday School Union Board 
that I am averse to the multiplication 
of rules, or of anything that will fet- 
ter the Sunday school teachers. We 
want to teach the children the simple 
principles of the Gospel. Care should 
be taken by the superintendency to see 
that this is done, and that the 
time of the Sunday school is 
not occupied in teaching subjects, 



the knowledge of which can be 
obtained outside of the Sunday 
school. I wish this could be impressed 
upon the minds of our superintend- 
ents and teachers. The Sunday school 
is a school, as I have said, and as you 
all ought and do understand, for 
the purpose of giving our chil- 
dren instructions in the princi- 
ples of the Gospel to indoctrinate them 
in its principles, and if, in 
the schools, we give them 
any history at all, it should 
be the history of our Church, 
and the dealings of God with His 
people; that is, from a sacred stand- 
point, a religious standpoint. 

Of course, information concerning 
the history of peoples can be given, 
or brought to bear occasionally, illus- 
trating God's dealings with mankind 
to prepare the way for the carrying 
out of His work. This is proper, but 
it is not proper to go into extended 
lessons upon secular history. 

INTERRUPTIONS IN SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 

Some time ago I was visiting one of 
our quarterly Stake conferences, and 
I found a good many of the Latter- 
day Saints had come from afar, 
driven long distances, to be present at 
the meetings, and the fore- 
noon, according to instructions, 
was devoted to the Sunday 
school. The meeting house was not 
large enough to admit of the gather- 
ing together of the children and 
Saints who had come from a distance. 
It seemed too bad that those who 
come such distances should have to 
wait until the afternoon meeting in 
order to get instructions, and I sug- 
gested that we should meet at nine 
o'clock with the Sunday schools, and 
hold the meeting say until half past 
ten, and dismiss and allow the Saints to 
come into the meeting house and for 
the conference to then be opened. The 
object in doing this was not to inter- 
fere with the Sunday school, but to 
prevent too much interference with 
the conference of the Stake. I 
thought both purposes could be an- 
swered by such an arrangement. 

In consequence of this it was sug- 
gested that the Sunday schools in the 
Stakes should meet at nine a. m. in- 
stead of ten, where the Stake quarter- 
ly conference was to be held, and 



76 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



where the building was not large 
enough to accommodate the adults ar 
well as the children. This, I believe, 
has been carried out to some extent. 
But lately we have heard that other 
conferences have been held, and the 
Sunday schools have been notified that 
they could meet at 9 a. m. instead of 
10 a. m. 

Now it is a rule that has prevailed, 
and it has been given out by the 
First Presidency, that the Sunday 
morning should be devoted to the Sun- 
day schools, and we do not want this 
arrangement, made for the Stake 
quarterly conferences, to be made per- 
manent with anything else. In other 
words, we do not want the Sunday 
schools to be changed from time to 
time to suit the convenience of other 
organizations. Therefore, we would 
like it to be understood by all superin- 
tendents of Sunday schools, that 10 
o'clock is the hour for the meeting of 
the Sunday schools, excepting in in- 
stances of the Stake quarterly confer- 
ences as I have mentioned. 

It is found by depriving, our chil- 
dren from attending the Sunday 
school, that it retards the progress 
of the school, and there have been 
remonstrances to the Union board in 
relation to this matter, requesting 
that the Sunday schools be not inter- 
fered with by funerals, or other dif- 
ferent meetings held on Sunday morn- 
ing. Sunday inorning has been as- 
signed to the Sunday schools, and 
should not be interfered with. 

Another point in connection with 
the Sunday school organization. 
There is a good deal of zeal being 
manifested at the time, very praise- 
worthy zeal, in the organization of the 
M. I. A. throughout the Stakes of 
Zion. It has come to us that in some 
instances the local officers have taken 
Sunday school workers out of the 
Sunday schools and appointed them to 
labor in the M. I. A. "We do not wish 
in the least — I do not — to curtail the 
influence, efficiency and good work 
being done by organizations so potent 
for good as are the M. I. A.; but we 
do not wish, and it is not proper, that 
one organization should interfere 
with another. The Sunday school 
workers should be permitted to work 
in their respective schools and ought 



not to be taken from their work. And 
on the other hand the Sunday school 
officers should not in any manner im- 
pair the efficiency or good work be- 
ing done by the M. I. A. Both organ- 
izations can run parallel and perform 
their labors and not interfere in the 
least with one another. Upon this 
point I think we should all agree, and 
ought to be very careful in our move- 
ments so as to preserve good feeling 
and to repress anything that would 
cause a spirit that is not of the Lord 
to arise. We are all laboring for the 
same purpose, speaking in general 
terms — and we should rejoice in the 
prosperity and success of every one ot 
these organizations — the Primary, 
Sunday School, Relief Society and 
everything of this character. I do 
not know another people upon the 
face of the earth so much organized 
as we are. We have organized gath- 
erings covering the life of the people 
from infancy to old age, and 
we should do all in our power to 
maintain their efficiency, and to pro- 
mote them and aid them in doing the 
good work designed for them. 

INFLUENCE OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 

I am greatly pleased with the in- 
terest manifested this evening by so 
large a congregation attending this 
meeting. We have cause to be very 
thankful to the Lord for that which 
He is doing in the training of our 
children. I have said before it was a 
most timely organization — that of the 
Sunday school in our midst — the or- 
ganization of a system by which they 
can be carried on systematically and 
thoroughly. There was perhaps at one 
time some doubt and disinclination on 
the part of different persons in the 
Stakes and wards regarding Sunday 
schools. Some officers did not care to 
attend the Sunday schools, and thought 
it was interfering with other 
matters, and other organizations. But 
that feeling has gone. I do not think 
there is a Bishop anywhere now or 
any other officer who is brought in 
contact with the people who does not 
feel pleased and thankful that there 
is such an organization as the Sunday 
school. It must be a help to the 
Bishops and to the teachers and to 
all the quorums and different officers 
— the High Priests, Seventies, Elders,

Priests, Teachers and Deacons 
throughout all the Stakes of Zion. 
Consider the condition we would be 
in if these schools were not organized! 
We would have our country filled with 
denominational Sunday schools- 
schools taught by those who do not 
believe in our doctrines, whose aim 
it would be to propagate their doc- 
trines and destroy the faith of our 
children in the Gospel as we under- 
stand it. But with this thorough 
organization, as Brother Griggs has 
told you this evening, in discussing 
how we may become more thoroughly 
organized by the establishment of 
branch Sunday schools, we can throw 
safeguards around our children and 
prevent them from imbibing unbelief. 

WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT. 

I want to say here that there is a 
wave of unbelief sweeping over the 
land, and we can feel the effects of 
it among us. The leading magazines 
or the popular magazines, are filled 
with ideas tending to unbelief, scienti- 
fic hypotheses that are designed to 
destroy faith in the Bible, faith in the 
creation of the world, faith in the cre- 
ation of man, faith in the origin of 
man, and in the existence of God. Now 
these doctrines are being spread very 
insidiously. They are being taught 
in all the universities and colleges, 
speaking generally, of the land, with 
but few exceptions. There is a gen- 
eration growing up who do not be- 
lieve in the cardinal principles of the 
Bible taught by our fathers, before 
the Gospel in its fulness was revealed. 
These doctrines are being undermined 
and it becomes the duty of the Latter- 
day Saints — it is the mission of the 
Latter-day Saints — to uphold these old 
truths and doctrines that have come 
down to us from God through the 
ages, to strengthen the faith of our 
children in them, and, so far as we 
can, to neutralize the effect of these 
false doctrines that are being taught. 
And our Sunday schools are among 
the greatest agencies to be used for 
this purpose — the teaching of our 
children the principles of the Gospel, 
and counteracting this dreadful unbe- 
lief and darkness that is spreading 
over the land. I feel that this is of 
great importance to us. I do not know 
of an organization today among any 
other people who are in the position 



we are, that are so well prepared to 
counteract these things, because we 
have the books and records that God 
has given. We have the Bible, but 
not that alone. They may indulge in 
their "higher criticism," and tell us 
that those whose names are attached 
to the various books of the Bible were 
not the authors of them; but 
we have something more sure 
than all their criticism. The Book ot 
Mormon is of divine origin, divinely 
translated by the gift and power of 
God, and this has come to us by the 
power of God, and we know it is pure. 
It was not translated by man's ability, 
hence we have a more sure word of 
prophesy, something to base our faith 
upon. We can call upon these testi- 
monies because we know they are 
impregnable and cannot be destroyed. 
In addition to this we have 
the word of God — the Book of 
Covenants, that has come from 
the Lord to us. It is the word of God 
to us who live now. Therefore we have 
three witnesses. They may assail the 
Bible, as they do, and endeavor to 
prove that the writings attributed to 
different men were not written by 
them. We leave that to them. They 
can do as they please with their learn- 
ing; we will cling to the Bible because 
we know that whatever errors there 
are, are the errors of uninspired men 
who have done the translating. But 
they must not, and they can not, tread 
upon other ground that we have. They 
have assailed the Book of Mormon 
from an outside standpoint, and claim 
that it was translated, or as 
they say, written by some one else 
than Joseph Smith. But we have dis- 
proved that, and the Book of Mormon 
comes to us pure, having been trans- 
lated by divine power, and it contains 
incontrovertible internal evidence to 
those who read it and know anything 
about the power and spirit of God — iv 
comes to them with internal evidences 
of its divinity, and they know it is 
true. Therefore we have this, be- 
sides which we have the Doctrine and 
Covenants, and these three witnesses 
enable us to occupy a different posi- 
tion from any other religious denom- 
ination upon the face of the earth. 

We should consider and teach our 
children all these things and fortify 
them against the pernicious doctrines

being circulated and being taught in 
the institutions of learning in the land, 
and fortify them so that they will not 
imbibe the errors which will pass 
away, for they are not true. Of course 
Yi the theories set forth by scientific 
men — some scientific men — there 
is some principle of truth. 
Evolution has some truth connected 
with it. But very many of these 
theories are misleading. 

I felt that I desired to say so much 
upon this subject to impress the Sun- 



day school teachers and superintend- 
ents with the importance of confining 
our Sunday school work to the mission 
of the Sunday school, that is, teaching 
our children the principles of our re- 
ligion. God bless you all. Amen.

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

It is now my privilege to read a Statement by the First Presidency of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

STATEMENT BY THE FIRST PRESIDENCY 

The meeting of the Saints in this General Conference finds the 
world still war-torn. Millions of the Lord's children are suffering and 
mourning. All the woes and misery that attend armed conflict are spend- 
ing their force upon them. 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 5 First Day 

From these afflicted peoples comes the prediction that the approach- 
ing winter will bring famine. If famine shall come, the history of the 
past shows it will likely bring plagues with it. 

Our brethren and sisters are found on both sides of this terrible 
struggle. On each side they are bound to their country by all the ties 
of blood, relationship, and patriotism. 

As always happens in such cases, each side claims to believe it is 
in the right. Each claims to feel it is fighting for its very existence. 
As the war progresses in its cruelty and horror, each may come to aim 
at the complete subjugation or extermination of the other. 

THE LORD'S WAY 

This would be an inhuman and unrighteous purpose. God's way 
requires that nations shall live in peace and amity, one with another. 
The Master's command was : 

Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use 
you. (Luke 6:27-28) 

The Saints on either side have no course open to them but to support 
that government to which they owe allegiance. But their prayers should 
go up day and night that God will turn the hearts of their leaders towards 
peace, that the curse of war may end. 

God is not pleased either with war, or with the wickedness which 
always heralds it. When He uses war, it is to wipe out sin and un- 
righteousness. 

The hearts of all the Saints are torn with grief over the sufferings 
of their brethren and sisters who are taking part in this struggle. So, for 
the Saints this is a fratricidal conflict. They so mourn over it. Their 
prayers ascend to our Heavenly Father that the war may come to a 
speedy end. 

To those Saints who are stricken by this great tragedy, we say live 
righteously, pray constantly, and the Lord will answer as your faith and 
works and His all-wise purposes allow Him. 

To those whose wickedness has brought this strife and turmoil, 
we say repent lest the Lord shall smite you in His wrath. He will not 
hold you guiltless of the innocent blood of your f ellowmen. 

To all the nations, we say adjust your differences by peaceful means. 
This is the Lord's way. 

America's opportunity to be peacemaker 
To our nation we repeat the Master's admonition : 

Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of 
God. (Matt. 5:9) 

How infinitely greater it is to lead nations to peace, than to subdue 
a nation to chains. Let America put her house in order, forsake 
selfishness, greed, and avarice, abolish unrighteousness, wipe hate from 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR.

her heart, hold in loyal friendship the good and upright of all nations 
and peoples. Then to her shall come the high destiny of the peacemaker. 

PRAYER FOR PEACE 

We humbly pray our Heavenly Father, that He will send to the 
earth His messengers of peace, that this terrible war shall afflict no more 
nations and spread no farther over the face of the land, that fear and 
frenzy shall be driven out from their place among the peoples, that hate 
shall be banished from the souls of men, for where hate abides, there 
righteousness cannot live ; that sanity shall again assert its sway, and that 
love shall fill the hearts of men even to overflowing. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Taking advantage of the fact that I am conducting the meeting, 
and in order to put myself out of misery as early as possible, I wish now 
to say something to the Conference, and, as I wish to make it as con- 
cise as possible and be sure to say the things as nearly like I want to say 
them as possible, I have submitted it to writing. 

PAMPHLETS 

Reports come to us that pamphlets are being circulated among the 
people under circumstances that lead some to believe they are published 
and distributed under some kind of approval or sanction from the Gen- 
eral Authorities of the Church. These pamphlets are said to contain 
extracts from early sermons delivered by the early leaders of the Church, 
the parts of the discourses printed having to do with world conditions 
which the compilers of the pamphlets apply to the situation existing in 
the earth today. 

COMPILATION AND DISTRIBUTION NOT AUTHORIZED 

The General Authorities have had nothing whatever to do with the 
preparation of these pamphlets nor have they sanctioned or approved 
their compilation or issuance. When the General Authorities shall 
wish to do anything of this sort, they will do it under their own names 
and will not hide their identity behind some Church member. 

It is also reported to us that in many cases, these extracts as ap- 
pearing in the pamphlets are in effect garbled and that moreover when 
read in the full text in which they appear, they take on quite a different 
meaning from what they seem to have when torn from their context. 
A text should always be studied for its real meaning in connection with 
the full context. 

Furthermore, it is our information that these pamphlets are in some 
instances being surreptitiously merchandized even in the Temples, and 
also in Priesthood quorum meetings. This should not be done. The 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Temples are holy places ; they are not book stores ; they are not places 
in which propaganda is to be carried on. The people are warned against 
all these perversive activities. Moreover, Priesthood quorum meetings- 
are not book-selling gatherings ; they are meetings for the study of the 
Gospel and the carrying on of the regular Priesthood activities. 



, There are too many marriages of our young people that are mere civil 
marriages — marriages for time. This is much to be regretted. It is a 
situation that calls for remedy from every Bishop, from every aux- 
iliary organization, and from every parent. 

After its absence from the earth for hundreds and hundreds of 
years, the Lord revealed in this Dispensation of . the Fullness of Times, 
the principle of the eternity of the marriage covenant, and He restored 
to the earth the divine authority to consummate it. This revelation 
and this restoration makes of marriage a holy relationship, out of which 
and out of which only, can come man's greatest glory and exaltation. 



You young people are trifling with your divine destiny, you are 
treating lightly a great commandment, you are casting aside as dross the 
greatest opportunity that comes into your life, when you fail or refuse to 
be married in our temples where husband and wife may be sealed for 
time and for all eternity by the men bearing the holy Priesthood of 
God. A civil marriage — and that is all any marriage is that is performed 
outside the temple — merely legalizes a marital relationship. It has none 
of the effects of a sealing for time and eternity. 

You young people, if you think enough of one another to marry at 
all, you should love one another enough to wish to perpetuate your 
association forever ; if you do not think enough of one another for that, 
you may well hesitate long before you decide to go forward in life 
otherwise. The situation is not changed by having your Bishop or 
President of Stake, or some ex-Bishop friend, or like person, perform 
the ceremony for time. All these are civil marriages only. 



In his eloquent oration on the Pioneers last July, President Bryant 
S. Hinckley read the following statements made by Brigham Young : 

Talk about these rich valleys, why there is not another people on 
earth that could have come here and lived. We prayed over the land, and 
dedicated it and the water, air, and everything pertaining to them unto 
the Lord, and the smiles of heaven rested on the land and it became produc- 
tive and today it yields the best of grain, fruit, and vegetables. . . . There 
never has been a land from the days of Adam until now that has been 
blessed more than this land has been blessed by our Father in heaven; 
and it will be blessed more and more if we are faithful and humble and 
thankful to God for the wheat and corn, the oats, the fruit, the vegetables,

the cattle, and everything He bestows upon us, and try to use them for the 
building up of His kingdom on earth. 

I can remember, and so can all you older brethren and sisters, when 
our lands were in the heydey of their productivity. We can remember 
when the snow drifted deep in the mountain gorges, when the run-offs 
of the springtime made our streams rushing torrents that watered our 
lands and spread out upon them the rich fertilizing sediments from the 
mountains, when our farmers and stockmen were prosperous, when we 
merited the symbol adopted for the State — a busy hive of industry, when 
our homes and fences and barns and corrals were in repair, when our 
farmers' words were as good as their bonds, and both were A-l. 

CHANGING SCENES 

The old time snows have not been falling in the mountains for 
many years. Our farms are run-down, many acres of them are idle, our 
fences and barns and corrals are falling down, our homes are unpainted, 
the roofs leak, our streets are full of weeds, too many of our meeting 
houses are shabby, we look too much like idling ne'er-do-wells. Another 
fifty years of this will almost return us to the desert. 

Again quoting Brother Brigham : 

You inquire if we shall stay in these mountains. I answer yes, as 
long as we please to do the will of God our Father in heaven. If we are 
pleased to turn away from the holy commandments of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, as ancient Israel did, every man turning to his own way, we shall 
be scattered and peeled, driven before our enemies and persecuted until 
we learn to remember the Lord our God and are willing to walk in His 
ways. 

There are other enemies than human persecutors. We can be our 
own worst enemies, and drive ourselves away from our most cherished 
possessions. 

LAND BLESSED THROUGH PRAYER AND EFFORT 

Would we not better pray again over this land and the air and 
the water and everything pertaining to them? Would we not better 
turn our reliance to our own efforts and their fruits as blessed by the 
Lord? Why should the Lord bless the land we do not farm? Why 
should He give us water for that land we are not using ? Why should 
He give us crops when we do not plant ? Why should He bless us with 
His blessings when our reliance is put not in Him but on government 
gratuities for not working, for not farming, for not doing the things 
that have been man's allotted part since Adam was driven from the 
Garden. 

The Lord cannot be pleased with shiftless idleness ; those of us in 
default must mend our ways. 

The tragedy of all this is, that the innocent must as always suffer 
at least in part the punishments that afflict the guilty. The rain falls 
on the unjust as upon the just, and the lands of the just parch as do 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. October 5 First Day 

those of the unjust. Yet God will not forget those who serve Him 
and keep His commandments. Their reward is sure, in their happiness, 
in their blessings of contentment, of health, of the consciousness of a 
life well lived, in their salvation and exaltation. 

CHURCH GRAIN ELEVATORS 

As the press has announced, the grain elevator which has been 
under construction at the Church Storage Square has now been com- 
pleted. Its capacity is 318,000 bushels. With what may prove to be a 
spirit of forecast, it has been named Church Elevator No. 1. The 
Church also has an elevator at McCammon, Idaho, with a capacity of 
some 80,000 bushels, and a small one at Sharp's Spur, Levan Ridge, with 
a capacity of 8,500 bushels — or a total wheat storage capacity of some 
400,000 bushels. 

The Church has borne the cost of securing and building these 
elevators. The Relief Society Wheat Fund will be used by the Relief 
Society to fill the elevators with wheat. The Church will assume the 
upkeep, maintenance, repair cost, as also the cost of storage of and in 
these elevators. It will be necessary from time to time to replace this 
wheat so stored. The Church will absorb the losses incident to this 
operation, and if at any time such operation yields a profit, this will be 
applied towards the costs of running the elevator. 

So far as possible, all labor incident to this storage operation will 
be Welfare labor. 

A relatively small part of the storage space in these elevators will 
be used by the Welfare Committee for storing various grains in con- 
nection with their various operations. 

WHEAT DONATIONS RESTORED 

Thus we return to its original form the donations of wheat, made 
by the people to the sisters, and by the Relief Society sisters themselves, 
beginning back in the time of Brigham Young. These donations were 
made at the sacrifice of comforts and sometimes of necessities. In the 
beginning they frequently represented the result of gleaning the wheat 
fields by the sisters themselves, — a grievous toil ofttimes, but one that 
brought joy to their hearts at the time and a reward from their Heavenly 
Father in the hereafter. Our fathers and grandfathers, our mothers 
and grandmothers were fashioned in heroic molds ; they were built of 
the virtues that make mighty empires. It is not too much to hope and 
pray that we of our day may measure to their stature. 

WELFARE PLAN 

The Welfare Plan is growing daily in its efficiency, thanks to the 
untiring devotion of the Welfare workers in the Wards, and Stakes, and at 
the central office. 

The Plan has now been in operation a little over four years. During 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



11 



that time it has helped an average of about 50,000 individuals annually. 
Experience has been gained that has enabled those in charge so to 
perfect their plans that, as was stated at the last April Conference, 
we feel assured that short of a great worldwide calamity that should 
affect the very foundations of our whole economic life, the Church 
will be able to care for the indispensable needs of its worthy poor, in 
time of want. This was our first objective, — to maintain life. 

TO REBUILD CIVIC, RELIGIOUS LIVES 

Co-equal with that was the rebuilding in those who had a temporary 
misfortune, of a full civic and religious life. It was the aim that no 
one of them should come to feel that because he had suffered a financial 
setback, he had had closed against him any social or spiritual activity 
or opportunity for progress and ultimate achievement. No Bishop 
has done his full duty, and no Ward Relief Society has met its full 
opportunity, that has left any needy Ward member in doubt on these 
matters. 

From the very beginning, the problem has been to keep away from 
ambitious and often ill-considered plans and schemes for remaking society 
and recreating our economic structure. It would have been a simple 
matter to begin visionary undertakings that would not only have bank- 
rupted the Church but that would have broken the heart and courage 
of all of us by the greatness of our disaster. We have therefore gone 
slowly and watched each step taken. The Lord has been with us in 
this plan. 

EXPANSION OF PLAN 

As by-products of securing the necessaries of life for the needy, 
we have adventured into a few other fields where we felt we could 
help those who were near distress as well as those actually in need. 
We have created an organization that has made small character loans to 
men and women who could not borrow from financial institutions ; we 
have set up a manufacturing establishment for the renovating and build- 
ing of household furniture and fixtures, which gives employment par- 
ticularly to willing but aged unemployables, and that provides cheap 
articles for the needy. We have set up an agricultural committee to 
help find farms for young men especially who wished to farm and 
whose training and experience gave some reasonable assurance they 
could farm successfully. We have now set up a committee whose business 
it is to investigate what, if anything, the Church may wisely undertake 
to do, consistent with its resources, to help by advice or otherwise in 
setting up cooperatives, both for production and marketing. 

MEASURES TAKEN TO PRODUCE WELFARE MATERIALS 

One of our aims has been to produce as fast and as fully as possible, 
within the program itself, all the materials we need to carry out our 
Welfare work. We are doing this first by making surveys of the needs 



1 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Day 

of each Ward and Stake of the Church, then by making a budget of 
production covering these needs, and then by assigning these budgetary 
needs among the various Stakes able to produce them. The first year we 
were able to furnish only some 10% of what we used. This proportion 
has constantly risen each year until last year we produced approximately 
58% and this year we expect to produce, in our better organized regions, 
substantially 70% of our needs, and we hope by another year to make 
it nearly 100%. There will always be a few articles, such as spices, for 
example, that we must buy. 

In doing all this, we have acquired and are operating a coal mine, 
we have helped in starting lumber mills, a plaster mill, we are now 
setting up a poultry farm, and are preparing to install a milk processing 
plant. Other things will be added as rapidly as consistent with a wise 
development. Lastly we have set up, as an experiment, a small revolving 
fund to be used in building very modest homes for those who are in a 
position to get some help from financial institutions. This can easily 
lead into such large outlays of money that we are going ahead very 
carefully and slowly. We never forget that the funds we are handling 
are stamped with the most sacred trust that can mark money, for they 
are the tithes and offerings given by the Saints to build up the Church 
and Kingdom' of God. Out in the Northwest they are carrying on 
locally such a housing program under most promising circumstances. 
The same sort of operations are going on in many other parts of the 
Church, principally under the direct sponsorship of Priesthood quorums. 
All this is most gratifying and encouraging. We are very hopeful that 
out of all these experiences we shall be able to work out a successful 
plan for such undertakings, but, I repeat, we are going slowly and 
cautiously, and here, as always, we must look primarily to the local 
groups themselves to carry on this work, not alone the work of supplying 
the labor therefor, but the burden of furnishing the finances, also. The 
Church cannot undertake, the undertaking would be too vast, to furnish 
the money for this and other like matters, the Church Wards and Stakes 
or Priesthood quorums furnishing merely the labor. These agencies 
must also look forward to furnishing the great bulk if not all of the 
finances as well as the labor for such special projects. 

WELFARE PLAN FOR MUTUAL HELPFULNESS 

As was expected, there are now appearing certain tendencies which 
unless we meet them squarely and correct them at once, will lead to the 
creation of a Church dole system, the very last thing the Church intends 
to do. From the foundation of the Church until now, idleness has 
been condemned as unworthy of Church members, as destructive of 
character, as violative of the true Christian life, as contrary to the com- 
mand given to Adam as the law of this world "In the sweat of thy brow, 
thou shalt eat bread." The Lord has repeatedly spoken about it in our 
time. 

The task which the Welfare system has now most urgently to do 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



13 



is to provide work for those who receive help. We urge all of the 
people to cooperate with the Ward Welfare Committees to this end. 
It should be possible for plans to be worked out by which any man 
in a community having a job to be done could go to his bishop and state 
his need ; that then the bishop, either directly or through the Stake or 
regional organization, could supply this man with the help needed for 
the job ; the man having the work done would pay to his bishop, as a 
contribution to the Welfare Plan, the cash value of the labor at the 
regular wage values ; to the man doing the work at the instance of the 
bishop, the bishop would give as compensation for his work, an order 
on the storehouse for the things which the man needed, or in some 
cases the man might be given part cash, the order on the storehouse 
and the cash to furnish sufficient to meet the needs of the one doing 
the work. Such an operation will give the Welfare worker something 
to do, it will enable the member having the work to do to get the work 
done as cheaply and as well as he could get it done otherwise and it will 
give to the member having the work done and to the Welfare worker 
joy and satisfaction over their mutual helpfulness. I want to say to 
the people of the Church that we have found these Welfare workers 
capable and industrious in what they undertake. They are not the kind 
of workers that the W. P. A.'s are sometimes described to be. Welfare 
workers are frequently men who from one cause or another are no longer 
employable in regular industry but who, like their younger fellow Welfare 
workers, can and will still do a day's work for a day's pay. We honor 
all such men and are grateful to the Lord for their integrity, industry, 
and devotion to their duty, and for their loyalty to the Church. 

"good times" 

By the present outlook, there will be for the next months a great 
increase in industrial activity, which may be expected to have a general 
reaction on all business, and if so we shall have a period, longer or 
shorter, of so-called good times. We members of the Church should 
not be misled by this. The great bulk of the money which is to be ex- 
pended in this industrial expanse will be wholly unproductive from an 
economic standpoint. The nation will be billions poorer, not richer by 
these expenditures, in so far as our economic, commercial, and industrial 
national life is concerned. These billions must be raised either by 
increased taxes, which we must expect will increase the cost of living, 
or by further borrowings that will greatly increase our public debt and 
so add to our taxes, or the money may be raised by both means. As I 
said at another Conference, after the war with all this destruction of 
wealth — that is property — is past, we must be prepared to face anothei 
depression, the depth and duration of which we may not now know 
We shall hope that this temporary "prosperity," as we shall probably call 
it, that may come, will not lead the Welfare organizations and workers to 
relax any effort to perfect their organization so as effectively to carry 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Day 

on their relief work. I assure you we shall hereafter need all the help 
we can now plan and provide for. 

COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE INAUGURATED 

In saying this I am not passing any judgment upon or making any 
criticism of our preparedness program. We must be able to resist 
invasion. But I may point out that for the first time in our history we 
are inaugurating universal compulsory military service and apparently 
we are preparing to maintain a great standing army, both of which have 
been under a wise ban during our whole national existence, because they 
have been deemed dangerous to our Constitutional government and to 
our free institutions. 

INVASION A REMOTE POSSIBILITY 

It may also be observed that we have had built in our minds a sort 
of frenzy of fear of foreign and subjugating invasion. Responsible 
military opinion credibly reported, is to the point that while desultory 
air raids causing great damage and considerable loss of life, might, 
under more or less ideal weather conditions over the whole Atlantic, 
be made against some of our Eastern coast cities, yet an armed invasion 
by great foreign armies sufficient to conquer us, is such a remote 
possibility under existing means and methods of transportation as should 
not make us hysterical, and we are nearly so now. 

It does seem that if the navigation of a channel 20 miles wide can 
hold up a belligerent from making even an attempt at armed invasion 
for a period of weeks now ripening into months, that the navigation of 
an ocean 3000 miles wide might be a suff icient barrier to any great armed 
invasion at all, and we need not take too seriously threats by that 
belligerent to do so, or his brags either. One hundred thirty odd millions 
of free people, with unlimited resources and the highest industrial de- 
velopment in the world, will give some pause to the most ambitious 
ruler. Nevertheless, until the world quiets down and sanity comes 
back to men, we should be prepared to repulse such an invasion if it came. 
Our preparation should be solely to repel invasion, not to conduct an 
aggressive war nor to make conquests. But let us not fall into a panic 
of fear. 

WAR 

In the hope that it may tend to mitigate some of the hate now 
rising that threatens to engulf us, as well as for our peace of mind 
and our ability to gauge future happenings, it seems well that we should 
be under no misapprehension as to the present status of the United 
States in the existing European conflict. By all the rules and principles 
by which nations have governed their conduct in the past, the United 
States has already committed several hostile acts and we are in fact now 
at war, 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



15 



It is the settled law of war, that the private citizens of neutral 
states may, without in any way jeopardizing the neutrality of their 
sovereign, carry on commerce with either or both belligerents subject 
to certain rights of search, seizure and confiscation by the belligerents 
in cases of trading in contraband of war or in case of violating a legal, 
effective blockade; but it is just as well settled that no neutral state 
can itself supply one belligerent with the materials of war, without thereby 
losing its character as a neutral and becoming itself a belligerent. 

The nations of the earth in their last voluntary and near unanimous 
statement of the law on these matters, declared : 

The supply, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by a neutral power 
to a belligerent power, of warships, ammunition, or war material of any 
kind whatever, is forbidden. (Hague Convention XIII, 1907) 

U. S. NEUTRALITY VIOLATED 

There seems no question but that we have supplied to one of the 
belligerents, our own secret inventions for waging war, our own air 
armament, and now our own armed vessels of war, fully provisioned 
and in every way equipped for immediate belligerent service. Opinions 
differ as to whether or not Congress authorized the last transaction, 
but Congressional approval would not change the international character 
of the act but only give relief from the violation of our own law. 

We have been the victims of a similar act upon the part of Great 
Britain. In 1863, the Confederates were fitting out at Birkenhead, 
opposite Liverpool, two iron-clads for use against Union commerce. 
Our Minister in London repeatedly called the situation to the attention 
of Earl Russell, who replied that the British Government "could not 
interfere in any way with these vessels." Mr. Adams, answering, ex- 
pressed "profound regret" at this conclusion of the British Government, 
and added : "It would be superfluous in me to point out to your Lordship 
that this is war." The British Government then acted. 

As the result of other and many acts of the sort threatened here, 
we demanded arbitration as to whether or not Britain had violated 
her neutrality. Britain, be it said to her eternal credit (for our charges 
touched really her honor) consented. The result of the arbitration 
was the largest single award of damages in our favor ever rendered 
by any arbitral tribunal. 

HOSTILE ACTS 

Again there seems no doubt but that we now have made some kind 
of an alliance with one of the belligerents, Canada, that if her enemy 
shall attack her, we shall join in Canada's defense. Thus agreeing to 
give aid and succor to one of the belligerents against the other, if it is 
attacked by the other, and such attack is of course the normal course 
of war, is on our part a hostile, belligerent act against Canada's enemy. 
So we are at war also on that score. 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Day 

Finally, while the details are not known, we are said to have leased 
some naval or air bases from one of the belligerents without, it is as- 
sumed, consulting the other belligerent. These leases are probably 
in such form and made for such purposes as also constitute hostile acts, 
for it is inconceivable that Britain, following her centuries-old policies, 
would lease to any power any of her territory for military use and 
occupancy, except she was to receive military aid as the result. 

So we are at war. We should not be misled as to the nature of our- 
acts, if and when Britain's enemy strikes back at us. In such event, 
should we be told that Britain's enemy commits against us an act of 
aggressive, inexcusable warfare, we should know that this will not 
be fact, for under the rules and principles of war we have already 
in effect declared war against that enemy. 

As already stated, I have said these things in the hope that it may 
assuage a little the hate that will be piling up if and when that act comes. 
A Latter-day Saint cannot hate anybody. The hates of the last war 
are the moving cause of this one. So it will be to the end, unless 
we shall conquer hate. This the Gospel helps us to do. 

REGISTRATION 

Utah has an honorable record for its service and support of this 
nation in times of war. The people of the Church share in that record. 
The people of the Church are patriotic. In this time of preparation 
for eventualities which we all pray may not come to us, we people must 
do- our full share. We shall confidently expect that no young man 
member of the Church, will seek to evade his full responsibility. We 
feel assured that every young man will do his full duty, and live 
the precepts that guide the Church and its membership "in obeying, 
honoring, and sustaining the law." We ask our young men who 
go into training camps to remember always the teachings of their parents 
and of the Church; we ask them to keep themselves unsoiled, in body 
and mind; we ask them to remember that our faith requires that they 
be 'honest, true, chaste, benevolent, and to do good to all men, . . . and 
that if anything is virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, 
they should seek after those things.' If they shall do all these things 
we promise them the blessings of the Lord. 

FAMINE AND PLAGUE 

As has been already noted, both belligerents appear to have predicted 
famine for the other. One of the belligerents has, according to the press, 
predicted plague for the other. If this prediction means that the one 
making it intends to infect the other with plague, by some means or other, 
then it must be said that such infection would mark a degree of infamy 
and savagery for which the modern world holds no parallel, and against 
which all the instincts of humanity would cry out and all Christian 
principles adjudge condemnation. 

But war always brings plagues which seem to find their best breeding 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



17 



places in great groups of men brought together in armed camps. We 
may not confidently expect that plagues will not break out in Europe, 
nor that breaking out there, they will not appear amongst us. I have 
pointed this out before. 

Our hazard will probably be increased through our great training 
camps, which must also be manned by a great group of physicians, sur- 
geons, and nurses that will be taken from their service to the whole 
people. 

We at home owe it as a duty to ourselves, to our country, and to 
humanity, to keep ourselves as free from contagion, as fully healthful, 
as possible. 

THE LORD'S DISEASE-PREVENTIVE LAW 

The Lord has told us how to do this. Many have not hearkened 
to His word, who would not deny its truth ; others have not believed 
it was His word. But God will vindicate His commands, by blessing 
those who keep them, and by permitting the ordinary laws of nature to 
operate, uncontrolled, upon those who do not. 

President Grant has for half a century been preaching the Word 
of Wisdom to the people. If we had followed his counsel, we could 
now face the future fearlessly. If sickness and disease shall overtake us, 
we shall then remember. It is to be hoped that if disaster shall overtake 
any of us, we shall not be in such a situation that we must reproach 
ourselves for a failure to live the disease-preventive law of the Lord. 

How glorious are the blessings promised to those who do keep 
God's laws : 

And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel 
and marrow to their bones. 

And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 

And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. (D. &. C. 
89:18-21) 

THE PROMISE 

This does not say and this does not mean, that to keep the Word of 
Wisdom is to insure us against death, for death is, in the eternal plan, 
co-equal with birth. This is the eternal decree. But it does mean that 
the destroying angel, he who comes to punish the unrighteous for their 
sins, as he in olden time afflicted the corrupt Egyptians in their wicked- 
ness, shall pass by the Saints, who are "walking in obedience to the 
commandments," and who "remember to keep and do these sayings." 
These promises do mean that all those who qualify themselves to enjoy 
them will be permitted so to live out their lives that they may gain the 
full experiences and get the full kowledge which they need in order to 
progress to the highest exaltation in eternity, all these will live until 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Dag 

their work is finished and God calls them back to their eternal home, 
as a reward. 

These blessings will come to those who qualify as sure and certain 
as life itself. 

Whenever we are inclined to appraise the dealings of God with 
His children, we should remember that God's ways are not man's ways, 
and that behind what we see and understand, are the all-wise purposes 
of an All-wise God. 

May God bless us, preserve us, and help us to keep His command- 
ments always, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation and Choir sang the hymn, "We Thank Thee, O 
God, for a Prophet." 



ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I do not remember any occasion in my life that I have been more 
deeply impressed with the remarks of Brother Clark than I have been 
today — timely, wise, prudent — and I wish that every American citizen 
could have heard them. When I see this vast audience, knowing that 
every soul here was deeply interested — f or I took particular occasion to 
see whether they were or not, — and I noticed there was no restlessness, I 
am convinced beyond question of a doubt that every word uttered re- 
ceived a hearty response in the hearts of the people, and created a spirit 
of testimony as to the wonderful conditions portrayed to us. 

QUOTATIONS FROM THE SCRIPTURES ON PRAYER 

I thought this morning that I would refer to Matthew, sixth chapter, 
(v. 5-13) in which we find the following: 

And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for 
they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the 
streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have 
their reward. 

But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou 
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father 
which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 

But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen do; for they 
think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 

Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what 
things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 

After this manner therefore pray ye ; our Father which art in heaven, 
hallowed be thy name. 

* * * * 

Ask, and it shall be given you ; seek, and ye shall find, knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you : 

For every one that asketh receiveth : and he that seeketh findeth ; and to 
him that knocketh it shall be opened. (Matt. 7:7-8) 

All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. 
(Matt. 21 : 22) 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



19 



Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, 
believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. 

And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: 
that you Father also which is in heaven may forgive your trespasses. 
(Mark 11:24-25) 

SERVANTS OF THE LORD BLESSED THROUGH PRAYER 

If you remember the time when Peter was imprisoned by Herod 
who was persecuting the Church, and prayer was made without ceasing 
by the Church of God for him. Peter was bound with chains and smitten 
between two soldiers, and the keepers before the door kept the prison. 
Behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the 
prison, and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, "Arise 
quickly," and the chains fell off from his hands ; and the angel said unto 
him, "Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals." So he did, and he said : 
"Cast thy garment about thee and follow me." He went out and followed 
him, and he wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; though 
he saw a vision. 

When Paul the Apostle was preaching to his brethren in Asiaj they 
were very sick and despaired of their lives, but the prayers of the people 
restored him to health and strength. 

Have we in this day and age forgotten how to pray ? Are we draw- 
ing away from our Father in heaven with our hearts ? Let us remember 
the passage in James, chapter 1, verses 5, 6, 7: 

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 

But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is 
like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 

For let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord. 

STORY OF A WOMAN'S CONVERSION 

I heard a story of a woman, a fine woman of good family, who came 
through pain to the habit of drink and drugs. She fought against it with 
all the strength of her strong will and mind, but she could not conquer it. 
She went to a doctor and he helped her for a time. Then again she went 
under. She left her home and country and went alone to a strange land, 
hoping a new environment would put her on her feet, but she went down, 
and still further down. She met a Christian who talked to her of God. 
Her father and mother were intellectuals of their country ; they had re- 
jected God. She listened to the stranger who was a Christian, and long- 
ed to believe, but she could not, too deep was her conviction that God is 
only a wish fulfilment for weak people to hold onto. 

One night there was a terrific electric storm. She was so frightened 
for fear of the thunder and lightning that it made her almost like her 
' nerves were shattered. She walked the floor in fear of the terror of the 
storm. Finally she fell upon her knees and cried out : "You ! You ! if 
there is a You ! send me a sign ; stop this storm — stop it !" She crept back 
into bed, shaking and sobbing. The next thing she knew it was morning ; 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Dag 

the sun shining, and the birds were singing outside her window; not a 
cloud was in the sky. She had the feeling as though the world had just 
been made, and she with it, new and clean ; life was new and holy. There 
was a God. The woman who had taken care of her came to see how she 
had stood the night through that awful storm ; all night long it had rained. 
She stared at the woman unbelieving — the storm had been stopped — and 
then a smile and a light spread over her face. Never in all her life, not 
even when a child, had she slept through a storm. There was a God, and 
He. answered, but in His own way. 

She was won over instantly, she was cured. All desire for drink or 
drugs had been washed away. She became a power for good and gave 
her whole life to helping people find God. 

MISSIONARIES SENT IN ANSWER TO PRAYER 

I am thankful to my Father in heaven that He has answered my 
prayers and the prayers of my mother who prayed for the true Gospel to 
come to her while she was in a foreign country. He sent the missionaries 
of Christ's church with the truths of the Gospel to her in answer to her 
prayers. I am grateful that she taught me how to pray and to have faith 
that my prayers would be answered. St. John said : 

And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything 
according to His will, he heareth us : 

And if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we 
have the petitions that we desired of him. (I John 5:14-15) 

A PIONEER EXPERIENCE 

After the pioneers had been here nearly two years the harvest was 
going to be a bounteous one, and they were very happy and thankful to 
their Father in heaven. But myriads and myriads of black locusts swarm- 
ed the fields, mowing down all they could on their onward march ; the 
crops seemed doomed. No food was there to carry them through the com- 
ing winter ; the nearest food was a thousand miles away, and it could come 
to them only by ox-teams. Famine itself came in its form 
over the ground. It smote the hearts of brave men with fear; not for 
themselves, but for their wives and children, dearer to them than life 
itself. Every effort to stop the plague of insect hordes failed. Des- 
peration seized the people, and in this hour of trial and threatened tragedy 
there came to them the faith that God was their sole refuge. They prayed 
for help. Out of the sky came great winged clouds of gulls. They settled 
down on the fields. At first it looked like they came to help the crickets 
destroy. But their real purpose was soon apparent; they came to prey 
upon the destroyers. All day long they gorged themselves, disgorged, 
and feasted again. The white gulls fell upon the black crickets like hosts 
of hell until the pests were banished and the people saved. The birds then 
returned to the lake. Kneeling, the grateful settlers wept tears of joy over 
their temporary deliverance, and thanked their God for this answer to 
their prayers. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



21 



My father passed through that experience. I have heard him repeat 
it to his family many many times. The first time I heard it I was a small 
boy and it is too long for me to tell the story that he told me. But I want 
to say to you that there never was, as I know or have read about, a divine 
blessing from God when the people had to depend upon Him entirely, 
greater than on the occasion referred to. 

Prayer is practiced in the Kingdom of God. Part of our prayers 
should be devoted to our leaders ; they have great responsibilities. Oh, so 
many of the people do not realize the responsibilities that fall upon the 
President and his Counselors these days. It has been so from the begin- 
ning and as long as there is life it will continue to be so. Let us pray for 
our leaders at all times instead of criticizing them ; pray that they may be 
given courage to continue with unflagging zeal from year to year ; pray 
for the power of God to be upon them. 

FAITH IN GOD SHOWN BY GREAT MEN 

There is on the Sub-Treasury building in New York a fine piece of 
statuary of George Washington at Valley Forge, kneeling down in pray- 
er in the woods. That figure explains a great deal the strength of Wash- 
ington's life. It is no accident that the two greatest Americans to whom 
we all look up and most admire — Washington and Lincoln — were men 
of prayer and men of faith in God. Their strong belief in God was the 
rudder which guided the ship. Abraham Lincoln on one occasion said 
to his physician: "One rainy night I could not sleep. The wounds of the 
soldiers and sailors disturbed my very bones, pierced my heart, and I 
asked God to show me how they could have better relief. After wrestling 
some time in prayer he put the plans of a sanitary commission in my 
mind and they have worked out pretty much as God gave them to me 
that night. You ought to thank your kind heavenly Father and not me 
for the sanitary commission." 

Benjamin Franklin said: Conceiving God to be the fountain of 
wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for ob- 
taining it ; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was 
prefixed to my tables of examination, for daily use : 

O powerful Goodness ! bountiful Father ! merciful Guide ! Increase in 
me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolu- 
tions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy 
other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours 
to me. 

William DeWitt Hyde wrote "A Boy's Prayer" ; 

Give me clean hands, clean words, and clean thoughts. Help me to 
stand for the hard right against the easy wrong. Save me from habits 
that harm me ; teach me to work as hard, and play as fair in thy sight alone 
as if all the world saw. Forgive me when I am unkind, and help me to for- 
give those who are unkind to me. Keep me ready to help others at some 
cost to myself. Send me chances to do a little good every day, and grow- 
more like Christ the Savior. 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Dag 

George Careless wrote the music of one of the most beautiful songs 
we have in my opinion : 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 
Uttered or unexpressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 

Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 
The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye, 
When none but God is near. 

Prayer is the simplest form of speech 
That infant lips can try ; 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 
The Majesty on high. 

Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 
The Christian's native air; 
His watchword at the gates of death; 
He enters heaven with prayer. 

One who prays to his Father in heaven will not go far wrong. God 
will be mindful of him. God bless you all, and may we not forget to pray, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I might enjoy the 
inspiration of the Lord's Spirit the moment or two I stand before you. 

It seems that the minds of some of us run in parallel channels. 
Brother Smoot has addressed you on the subject I had in mind. 

BLESSINGS ENUMERATED 

I am very grateful for membership in the Church ; I am grateful for 
my forbears who made it possible, by accepting the Gospel in Europe and 
coming to the Promised Land, for me and mine to enjoy peace and plenty. 
I am particularly grateful for the Priesthood of God which has been 
restored in these the last days, through the instrumentality of a prophet. 
I have only gratitude in my heart for the leadership in this Church, who 
have and are continuously advising and counseling people as to their 
spiritual and temporal needs. This advice and counsel is motivated and 
inspired from divine sources. 

As parents a wonderful opportunity is ours, particularly in that 
everyone of our sons can hold the Priesthood of the Lord and receive 
all the blessings attached thereto. The Priesthood is a shield against 
temptation; it motivates and inspires young men to the highest and 
noblest of deeds, and every young man, whether he holds the office of 
Deacon, Teacher or Priest, is a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. In 
accepting the Priesthood, young men, in all reality, enter into a contract 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 23 



with Christ whereby they will serve him faithfully and loyally when 
called upon to do so by those who are in authority, and the Redeemer 
will bless them, magnify them, and sustain them in their Priesthood 
work. All of these young men perform the various functions of their 
offices not in and of themselves as individuals, but, as I have said, as 
servants of the Lord Jesus Christ each one of them being commissioned 
to perform the duties of his particular office. 

It is a wonderful thing to contemplate that John the Baptist, the 
forerunner of the Redeemer who held the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood 
in the days of the Lord Jesus Christ, returned to earth, bestowing this 
divine gift of authority upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, giving 
them the right to preach the Gospel of repentance, to baptize for the 
remission of sins, and to enjoy the ministering of angels. 

OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOYS IN PRIESTHOOD 

Elbert Hubbard declared, "Be patient with boys. You are dealing 
with soul stuff ; destiny awaits just around the corner." I am not hesitant 
in declaring there are no boys the world over where destiny is awaiting 
around the corner as it awaits with glorious opportunities for the young 
men who hold the Priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Among them 
will be found the leaders of tomorrow : Bishops, Stake Presidents and 
General Authorities. With this future lying ahead of our young men, every 
parent must realize his and her responsibility in the task of guiding and 
directing these boys in thought and deed and qualification, in order that 
they shall be worthy and fully prepared to assume the duties and obliga- 
tions of tomorrow. 

May I say to those of our brethren who have the honor and privilege 
of associating with these boys in their Priesthood work, there is no work 
that can bring a higher degree of pleasure and satisfaction. Only a 
little time is required to get the confidence of a boy, and there is no con- 
fidence that is more implicit, and no friendship more loyal and devoted 
than that of a boy. 

STORY OF A BISHOP'S SUCCESS 

There was once a Bishop who had the high honor of ordaining 26 
young men to the office of Deacon. The experience of ordaining so 
many young men made a deep impression on his mind, and he asked 
himself the question, "What obligations have I assumed now as the 
Bishop of this Ward in bestowing this Priesthood upon these young 
men?" And after careful and prayerful thought he arrived at the con- 
clusion, there rested upon him and his two associates in the Bishopric, the 
responsibility of so guiding and directing the activities of these Deacons 
that when the time should arrive for advancement each and every one of 
them would be worthy and fully qualified to receive the office of a Teach- 
er. 

The first step in this program was to get the confidence of these 
young men. They were encouraged to present their problems to the 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Day 

Bishopric; problems of work, school problems, and the multiplicity of 
problems that boys of this age generally have. The boys responded, and 
these three magnificent men were always willing and prepared to render 
counsel and advice. Social activities were encouraged, the homes of the 
Bishopric, were frequented by the boys. Eventually these young men were 
ordained Teachers, and later the office of Priest was bestowed upon 
them. Eventually the day arrived when the young men reached the age of 
prospective missionaries. All of them were called ; twenty-five responded, 
the other one having a physical ailment which prevented him from accept- 
ing a call. These young men were ordained Elders, went out in the world, 
and with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, preached His plan of 
salvation with vigor and force. These young men were honorably released, 
returned home, and all of them are now married and rearing fine Latter- 
day Saint families. In addition to this they are considered among the 
outstanding citizens of their communities. I am sure you will agree with 
me that this is an outstanding achievement. And why? Simply because 
three men took a little interest in some boys. The achievement of these 
good brethren can be the blessing and accomplishment of any one man or 
group of men that will manifest interest in the young men of the Church. 

a boy's prayer answered 

I was deeply impressed by Brother Smoot's address on prayer. 
May I say there was never a time in all history when the habit of praying 
should be encouraged as now. Young men who hold the Priesthood of 
God are more inclined to call upon Him for assistance than the young 
men who have failed to receive the glorious blessings of the Priesthood. 
I recall an instance that occurred during the darkest days of the depres- 
sion. 

There was a poor widow and her family struggling against great 
odds to sustain and maintain themselves. In this family group the oldest 
child was an 18 year old son who was deeply touched because of the 
family situation and the terrific struggle his Mother was having in 
solving their economic problems. One day he declared to her, "Mother, 
if you will permit me to go to California I can secure employment and at 
least render some small assistance to you." The mother replied and said, 
"Son, permit me to think this over for a day or two." After two or three 
days she called her son to her side and said, "I give you my consent ; 
you may go to California upon one condition, and the condition is that 
you will always pray as you know we have prayed in this home morning 
and night, and although we have had our problems, the Lord has blessed 
us and assisted us in many ways." 

With his mother's permission, this young man gathered his few 
clothes in a bundle, took some food and water, and went on his way. He 
had planned to secure a ride across the barren wastes of the American 
desert from some passing motorist, but during these dark days of the 
depression very few people were traveling, and consequently he trudged 
for two days over the desert, at the end of which time an inventory of his 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



25 



food and water indicated that unless someone picked him up he would 
soon find himself in a very precarious situation, and in addition his shoes 
were about worn out. 

As he analyzed his condition there came back to him with a flash 
the advice of his mother — to pray regardless of where he might be. 
Looking up he saw in the distance a building, which proved to be a 
deserted service station. Standing by it was a dilapidated bill board. Ar- 
riving at the old building he went around to the rear of the billboard, 
knelt down and poured out his soul to the Lord, telling Him that unless 
someone came to deliver him, the possibilities were that he would perish. 

That day a friend of mine was traveling across the desert, his des- 
tination a large city in California where a convention of his company was 
to be held. As he sped across the desert he was cognizant of the fact that 
he had passed an old deserted service station. Going on for some distance 
the impression came to him which seemed to convey the message that he 
should turn around and go back. At first he thought little of it, but the 
impression came the second time stronger than before. Finally he turned 
to his wife and said, "Mother, I have had two rather peculiar experiences. 
Something tells me we should turn around. Do you know of any reason 
why we should ?" She replied, "No, but if you have had an impression I 
suggest that you turn around." He turned his car around in the middle 
of the desert, and upon approaching the old deserted service station and 
the dilapidated billboard, was hailed by the boy. The good man stopped 
and the boy asked if he might have a ride. Of course the reply was "yes." 

The man, his wife and the boy again started on their way toward 
California. Naturally the boy and the man became very friendly, the 
boy declared to the man, "You are an answer to my prayer. I had 
neither water nor food, my shoes are worn out, and I knew that in and 
of myself I could do nothing, and so I went back of the billboard and 
asked the Lord that someone be sent to deliver me." The full significance 
of the impressions that the man had experienced now dawned upon him, 
and with a tear in his eye he said, "Yes, son, I know that I am an answer 
to your prayers." 

Brethren and sisters, in this great Church many of our boys and 
girls could well afford to follow the example of this young man in 
being prayerful, and without doubt the Lord will hear and answer their 
prayers. We should teach them to pray ; teach them to be loyal to the 
leadership of this Church and particularly to follow the admonitions of 
the men who have been selected and appointed by the Lord to guide and 
direct the destiny of this people. I challenge anyone to point out one 
instance where the President or his counselors or the Quorum of the 
Twelve have ever given any advice but what it was for the good and 
benefit of the people. 

THE AUTHORITY TO BAPTIZE 

As parents we should impress upon our young people that as servants 
of God they act in their Priesthood capacities because the authority they 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 5 First Day 

hold has been restored to earth from a divine source. Teach them that the 
Priesthood is the divine right bestowed upon men whereby they act as 
His servants and agents in performing the ordinances of the Gospel and 
in building up the kingdom. This thought was impressively demonstrated 
to me while laboring as a missionary in the State of Missouri. A lady 
presented herself to my companion and I, applying for baptism. The time 
appointed was a Sunday afternoon on the banks of the Spring River, 
outside of Carthage, Missouri. Upon arriving at the appointed place we 
discovered that another minister and his group had preceded us, and the 
ordinance of baptism was being performed. 

We listened with a good deal of attention and interest to the baptis- 
mal prayer uttered by the minister. These were his words : "Under the 
great commission I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son 
and the Holy Ghost, Amen." The term "Under the Great Commission" 
stimulated some thought on my part. Returning to our room we opened 
our Bibles to see if we could discover what the minister presumed to 
call "The Great Commission." We found in the last few verses of the 
last chapter of the book of Matthew what is commonly known as "the 
Great Commission." As you will recall, the Savior was bidding farewell 
to his disciples for the last time, admonishing " them in the following 
words, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost : Teaching them to 
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am 
with you alway, even unto the end of the world." 

These verses the Lord spoke but to eleven men, commissioning 
them to go into the world preaching the Gospel of repentance and per- 
forming the ordinance of baptism for the remission of sins. Consequently 
he did not designate anyone who might have the desire to preach or 
baptize, which brings forcibly to mind the words of the Apostle Paul when 
he declared, "And no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that 
is called of God as was Aaron." 

What a glorious thought it is to contemplate that the Priests of 
the restored Church of the Lord Jesus Christ have been called as Aaron 
to perform the ordinance of baptism or any other Aaronic Priesthood 
duty because of divine light. The young men who perform the ordinance 
of baptism under no condition or consideration ever have to beg the 
question of authority, using such terms as "Under the Great Commission." 
But they declare emphatically and with full knowledge, "Having been 
commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen." And may I add they are 
the only group in the world who have the right to declare "having been 
commissioned of Jesus Christ." 

SERVICE BRINGS ITS REWARD 

I humbly pray that the Lord of Israel will bless, guide and direct 
us in our responsibilities of leading the youth of Zion in paths of right- 
eousness. When the day of responsibility comes, they will be willing, 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



27 



qualified and worthy to serve in any capacity. Such service will bring to 
them the greatest of heavenly rewards, a reward that cannot be stayed by 
the hand of man or the evil one, a reward predicated on obedience to 
the Lord, for He always keeps His promises and rewards them that serve 
Him. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, "For whoso is faithful unto the 
obtaining these two Priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magni- 
fying of their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of 
their bodies. 

"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of 
Abraham, and the Church and Kingdom, and the elect of God." 

May I earnestly suggest to you, there is nothing in this world that 
is of greater value than to achieve a place in the Celestial kingdom, 
wherein your sons and daughters may become the very elect of God, which 
I pray will be the blessing of everyone of them, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

The Singing Mothers sang the anthem, "Holy Art Thou," Sister 
Ruth Jensen Clawson, soloist, Sister Olive F. Rich directed the singing. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I would like to repeat my slogan of last Conference : Brethren and 
sisters, "Drive carefully." There is no reason why we should have a 
tragedy of death at almost every Conference which we hold. Brothers 
and sisters, if you will just take a little more time to get home or to get 
here, we will excuse you for being late at the meetings if you do so, 
and then we will not have these tragedies. 

Elder Joseph T. Finlinson, President of the Deseret Stake, offered 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

SUSTAINING THE AUTHORITIES 

We shall now sustain the General Authorities of the Church. 

For the benefit of those in the audience and those listening on the 
air, who may not understand this proceeding, I will make the following 
brief statement. 

CHURCH OFFICERS SUSTAINED BY ASSEMBLY 

In this Church all the General Authorities and other Church-wide 
officers are "sustained", — in a certain sense, "elected" — by the body of 
the Church in a General Conference, which is, speaking politically, a 
constituent assembly. 

NOMINATING POWER RESTS WITH PRESIDENT 

In this Church, the power of "nominating" or calling to office, is 
not in the body of the Church. This power is vested in the General Au- 
thorities of the Church, and in final analysis in the President of the 
Church who comes to his place under the guidance of inspired revela- 
tion. As a matter of fact, as our Articles of Faith — more or less the 
equivalent of the creeds of other Churches — declare : 

"We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by 
the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel 
and administer in the ordinances thereof." 

When the presiding authority has so "nominated" or chosen, or 
called any man to office, that man is then presented to the body of the 
Church to be sustained, in political language "elected." 

Thus the body of the Church has no calling or "nominating" power, 
but only the sustaining, or politically speaking, the "electing" power. 

When the presiding authority presents any man to the body of the 
Church to be sustained, the only power which the assembly has is to vote, 
by uplifted hand, either to sustain or not to sustain. 

MEMBERS CANNOT PROPOSE MEN FOR OFFICE 

Obviously, neither the body of the Church, nor any of its members, 
can propose that other men be called to office, for the calling of men is 
the sole power and function of the presiding authority. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



29 



Therefore all debate, all proposals of other names, all discussions of 
merit and worthiness, are wholly out of order in such an assemblage. Any 
person attempting so to interrupt the proceedings would be a disturber 
of the public peace, amenable to the ordinary peace officers of the law 
and would of course be so dealt with. 



I ought to say that any person having any charge to make against any 
officer of the Church can do so before the regular Church tribunals es- 
tablished for that very purpose of affording means of carrying out the 
discipline of the Church. But this sustaining, constituent assemblage of 
the Church is not such a tribunal. 

We shall now proceed to propose the General Authorities of the 
Church for the sustaining vote of this great body of Priesthood and 
Church membership. 

This is a solemn ceremony. You members of the Priesthood are ex- 
ercising one of your greatest privileges and highest prerogatives. 

GENERAL AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH 

President Clark then presented for the vote of the Conference the 
General Authorities and General Officers of the Church, also the General 
Auxiliary Officers, and they were sustained by unanimous vote of the 
congregation, as follows :

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

The morning breaks, the shadows flee ; 
Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day- 
Majestic rises on the world. 

A HIGH OBJECTIVE GIVEN 

I can think of nothing more expressive of the joy and gladness which 
came to our forebears as they contemplated the value and extent of this 
great work which we have the honor now to represent. We are engaged 
in a great and glorious enterprise, — the establishment of God's kingdom 
in the earth. I know nothing which is calculated more to keep our 
thinking right and our devotion firm than to keep that transcendent 
mission of the Church ever present in our minds. 

When I contemplate this high objective which is given to our people 
I recognize the need of applying our energy, our devotion, and our love 
to the accomplishment of this outstanding task, and I am almost over- 
whelmed at times with the tremendous responsibility, the obligation, and 
the opportunities which are entailed. I know nothing that would more 
help us to discharge this responsibility than to live in accordance with 
the principles of the Gospel of Christ. 

A CONCLUSION REACHED BY PRESIDENT GRANT 

I recall that some months ago — maybe it has been a year or more 
now — President Grant one morning came into our temple meeting and 
said in substance this: "Brethren, I have been thinking for a long time 
what I could best do in the closing years of my administration to advance 
the work of God and bless the people," and he said : "I have reached 
this conclusion that there is nothing I can better do than to persuade 
the people simply to keep the commandments of God." We all agreed 
with him, and upon reflection I think that all will concur that that is the 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



33 



best and most effective thing that we can do for the advancement of 
the great cause we represent. 

THE SOVEREIGNTY OF CHRIST MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED 

In order that we may better keep the commandments I am persuaded 
that there must ever be stored in our hearts a deep and abiding love for 
our Savior Jesus Christ, who is the King of this earth, who is at the head 
of the Kingdom of God, and whose humble servants we are. We worship 
Jesus Christ as the divine Son of our Eternal Father. We are committed 
to the great philosophy of faith which He gave to the world. 

We are not inclined, for which I am grateful, to worship merely 
His attributes, however desirable they may seem to us. We do not 
deny the sovereignty of the King Himself. In my humble judgment 
one of the reasons why the Christian faith has not made more progress 
in the world and has not more effectively influenced the life and the 
conduct of men and of nations lies in the fact that men have not, deep 
in their hearts, acknowledged the sovereignty and the Lordship of Jesus 
Christ. It is true that many of them have advocated His philosophy of 
life ; they have admired His great altruistic sayings, and the policy of the 
good neighbor, the friendship He has taught, His kindness, His mercy, 
but they have refrained from acknowledging Him as the divine Ruler 
with power to order our lives and provide for us the one true way by 
which we can best serve Him, establish His kingdom in the earth and 
win our way back into His presence. 

THE POWER OF GOD IS WITH HIS CHURCH 

My brethren and sisters, I realize that it seems indelicate and 
presumptuous to some of our friends to make the declaration that here 
and here alone in all this wide world is to be found the true commission 
coming from Jesus Christ to His servants ; that here only is set up the 
Church which is the foundation of the Kingdom, in the extension of 
which is to be realized our Father's purposes for the redemption and 
blessing of all mankind. I am aware that that statement does seem 
presumptuous, and I make it only because I am constrained to do so 
by the revelations that have come from God, and by the deep-seated 
conviction that I have that every word of it is true ; that the holy Priest- 
hood which has been given to men in this dispensation is the authentic, 
veritable power of God, that it came from divine source, and that they 
who first received it have given a true accounting of their heavenly 
experience in its bestowal. 

I recognize the fact that most of us men are weak and frail individ- 
uals, and it may seem to our friends of the world that we are scarcely 
worthy or capable to exercise the functions of this divine power. I 
myself feel weak as I contemplate this investiture of power, and I con- 
stantly pray that God will give me more strength and more wisdom and 
discernment in the exercise of the functions of the holy Priesthood. I 
do know, however, that God will qualify those who truly keep His 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Dag 

commandments and in whose hearts is an abiding love and a resolution 
to cherish this great and holy power that God has given to us. That 
power is needed in the world today. Thank the Lord that it is here to 
speak to the children of men. While they may not listen to it nor heed 
it, as coming from divine sources, there will come a time when men 
will recognize its authority and its import in the direction of the affairs 
of this world. 

THE LORD MAGNIFIES HIS SERVANTS 

I am not discouraged because I recognize that our numbers are still 
relatively small. Some one has said that there is but one Latter-day 
Saint to every ten thousand in the population of the world. It would seem 
an almost impossible task to disseminate the principles of truth with such 
a minority. But I remember that old saying that "God and one man are a 
majority" and I have confidence to state that if we keep ourselves in 
line with our duties; if we fully live these principles of the truth that 
we are charged to teach, God will give us power, He will magnify our 
work, He will make our messages reach into the far corners of the earth. 
He will sustain His own. 

I recognize too that in our weakness and frailty we are not able to 
carry forward the work as expeditiously as we might like. I believe 
that every delinquent man who holds this Priesthood retards the progress 
of God's work. I wish it were possible to appeal to these thousands of 
men who have received this divine commission to mend their ways. I 
am convinced that they who will not use and magnify this Priesthood 
will in the end lose it. I am satisfied in my own heart that this power 
was given to us for service. I interpret it in terms of service ; I am sure 
that the mere ordination is not sufficient, and only those will be ultimately 
chosen who make their lives conform to the principles upon which the 
Priesthood is founded. Then they will be vessels through which the 
Spirit of Almighty God may come to His children here in this earth. 

REPENTANCE A SAVING PRINCIPLE 

I trust that those who have been thoughtless, careless, and neglectful 
may repent of their ways. I deem it a great disaster for men who have 
had hands laid upon their heads in ordination to this divine power to 
forsake it. We hold out the hand of friendship and brotherhood and 
kindness and mercy and the principle of repentance and forgiveness 
to those who will repent. 

Of all the principles announced by our Savior, none has ever found 
a higher place in my affections than the principle of repentance and 
forgiveness. It seems that this kind and merciful provision of the Gospel 
is more adapted to human weakness than almost any other. I trust that 
our officers and all of us shall show the spirit of forgiveness and kindness 
towards those who do repent. I know of no parable that breathes more 
the true spirit of Christ than the parable the Savior told of the prodigal 
son, and I have always felt that he told the parable for the benefit of 
the father even more than for the benefit of the children. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS

He had that wayward Son take from his father his heritage, his 
patrimony, and waste it, and go away from his home, to spend that which 
had been given him in dissipation and riotous living, violating all the laws 
of his father's household, committing every sin in the category, and then, 
in the story, the boy was subjected to the utmost misery in penitence for 
his wrong-doing. After he had spent his wherewithal and was reduced 
to starvation, he was required to beg work from a friend he had known 
in his better days, sent to his estate; and, finally he came to that ig- 
nominious position of swineherd, a keeper of the hogs. We are told that 
so abject was his degradation that he was forced to eat the husks with 
the hogs which he fed. And then the spirit of repentance came over 
him and he recognized his great wrong, and he cried out to heaven, 
"I am no more worthy to be my father's son," and he pleaded for for- 
giveness. Making a resolution founded upon his penitence he found his 
way sorrowfully back to his father's home. Under the old Jewish law 
the father' would have turned him out, but the Savior vested the father 
with a divine love, and when he saw his wayward son return in penitence 
he went forth to meet him. He raised him up and clasped him in his 
arms, and called forth to his servants to bring a robe and put on him 
and to bring a ring and put on his finger, which was the symbol of his 
restoration to his father's household, and cried out, "Bring hither the 
fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry, for this my son was 
dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found." 

That is the way in which the Savior brought the spirit of repentance 
and forgiveness, and it becomes us, members of His Church, to carry that 
spirit in our hearts, and to exercise it toward our brethren and our sisters. 
To those who have made mistakes we hold out this glorious principle of 
repentance — come back, forsake your sins, and be received into the 
household of faith and the brotherhood of the Priesthood. 

JOY THROUGH FORGIVENESS 

I have never seen happier people than those who have repented. 
I remember one time — I do not know whether the President will re- 
member it — taking a young man to President Grant, a young man who 
had made a grievous error, heartsick and broken he was about it, and he 
said to me, "Do you think I could ever be forgiven." 

I said : "I will take you to the President." 

We went to the President, and the President became convinced 
that he had truly repented, and he forgave him. Of all the joy and 
happiness that I have ever seen written on a human countenance I think 
I saw the utmost on the face of that youth as he appreciated this gift of 
repentance and forgiveness. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we know the great purpose of our 
Church. We know of the need of its glorious principles in this sad and 
torn world. God help us to live, so to keep the commandments, so to 
have the spirit of Christ, that we may establish His mighty work in the 
world, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Fridzy, October 4 First Day 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I have certainly been interested, my brethren and sisters, as you 
have been, in the very splendid remarks and counsel that have come to 
us so early in our Conference. 

ADMONITION TO PROVE ALL THINGS 

The other day I was reading the words of Paul where he gave us 
the admonition to "prove all things, and to hold fast to that which is 
good." 

When I was a young boy my Sunday School teacher gave us this 
information. He said, "The flies are God's scavengers. You have noticed 
that just outside of the kitchen door the flies collect around the dishwater 
and other materials that may be thrown onto the lot and if it weren't 
for the flies eating up the waste material, we would all get sick." Of 
course this information was undoubtedly as good as could be had by 
him, or perhaps others, in regard to this matter. The fact that this had 
been told to us in Sunday School and by a man we all very much loved 
was no indication that the thing was right. Later in life we found that 
we could not hold fast to it because newly discovered evidence had proved 
it untrue. 

If we follow the admonition of Paul and put sufficient time into 
proving all things we will be able to find the things to which we should 
hold fast. In the various scientific fields this has been followed exten- 
sively, and it is the only method that can be followed in order to arrive 
at the truth. I have this thought in mind : that we are very much con- 
cerned and we spend considerable time in proving scientifically whether 
things are right or wrong, eventually arriving at a basic truth, which 
always remains a truth and as such helps in arriving at other truths. 

In the things that have to do with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
I am quite sure that we are not using this method to the same extent 
as we might use it in proving all things, and then in holding fast to that 
which is good. I heard one of our speakers say that we were on very 
poor ground when we thought our testimonies were sufficient in regard 
to some of the things that we declared that we knew. He said that very 
frequently, even when it came to testimony, we should put it on one 
side so that we might prove it right again. I can see no more advantage 
in eliminating the truth and the testimony that God gives us in religious 
things than I can see in continually disregarding basic truths of science. 
In arithmetic we might say that two times two are four is always correct, 
we prove it daily by its use. We get no place, we are confused when, 
in order to re-prove this proposition, we say two times two are five. 
It seems to me that this is the thing we do every once in a while with 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

THE VALUE OF A TESTIMONY 

The Lord in His mercy gives to us a testimony and demonstrates 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



37 



it to us in such a conclusive way that we know that we do have a basic 
religious truth for our testimony. For example, we know and we testify 
individually and collectively that God is a personal being and that we are 
made in His image. If our experiences and investigations, and His 
inspiration to us have proved this to be a basic truth, we should hold 
fast to it because it is good. 

Men in the past have not been able to understand our conception 
of God. They cannot see that anything in the shape of man could be 
able to have the ability, the power, and the majesty that dwell in God 
the Eternal Father. As we move through life we do have men who in 
a measure assume the qualities and majesty of God, and feel that they 
are quite necessary to the affairs of life, but these men are gradually 
eliminated as was the house that was built upon the sand. Perhaps the 
only trouble is that they are able to do so many wicked and bad things 
before the waves come. 

We have the same proposition in relation to the Word of Wisdom. 
We know the fundamental truth of the Word of Wisdom is based on a 
truth that cannot be eliminated or removed by any type of argument or 
reason. For instance, in coffee we have caffein that is harmful, yet we 
sometimes reason that the same thing that makes coffee objectionable 
may not be so objectionable when it is used in some other way. It 
just indicates that we have not proven the thing so thoroughly that we 
have been able to hold fast to that which is good and make it a part of 
our lives. 

THE SCRIPTURES MAKE CLEAR THE TRUTH 

The Lord has said: "Search the scriptures, for in them ye think 
ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me." Thus we 
have a way of finding the truth regarding God and His relations to us. ' 
We have a way of establishing the truth so thoroughly in our hearts 
that we will be able to hold fast to it. Perhaps if we had had the same 
interest and used the same time and the same thoroughness in searching 
the scriptures of the Lord as we have used in the field of science, we 
would find that we were growing in the ability to hold fast to that which 
is good, and not let it get away from, us. 

We have practically the same advice given to us in the Book of 
Mormon, but we seldom have a desire in our hearts to know whether 
this book is right or wrong. If we will go to this book, according to 
Moroni, and read it in a prayerful way, with faith, desiring to have a 
testimony and to find out as to its truthfulness, by the inspiration of 
God and the power of the Holy Ghost we shall know the truth. 

We who have taken this admonition, we who have accepted this way 
of proving the things of God, have readily found out, if we have done the 
thing sincerely, that the Book of Mormon is true, and that God gave 
it to His prophet, Joseph Smith. 

SAFETY IN KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS 

There are so many things in life that are vital to us. If we would 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Day 

go where we want to go, if we would have the blessings that we would 
like for ourselves and our loved ones, we must find out the things of God 
and then hold fast to them and never let them get away from us, either in 
times of tribulation or temptation, or times of joy and happiness. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to guard His word in that light 
and live sincerely the precepts and the admonitions given to us, for the 
Lord has said: "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Perhaps at 
the end of our lives we will have demonstrated how much love we have 
for God by the number of commandments that we have kept and held 
fast to. May He so bless us, I humbly pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

The Singing Mothers sang "Songs My Mother Taught Me," by 
Dvorak. Sister Permilla Bean directed the Chorus. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Since we are living at a time when wars of the greatest known mag- 
nitude are being fought between some of the most powerful nations of 
the world, very naturally we are wondering what the results are going 
to be and particularly what part our own country will play in this intense 
and most disheartening conflict. We are all extremely anxious to know 
whether or not our government is so constituted that it can endure in- 
definitely, or whether the time is now approaching when government 
of the people and by the people and for the people is to perish from the 
earth. 

Dr. Andrew D. White, great scholar, wise diplomat, historian, and 
the first president of Cornell University, said many years ago that 
since all the republics of the past have failed, he had made a careful 
study for the purpose of determining whether in our republic there 
is any element that did not exist in those republics which have not endured. 
His conclusion was that the only new and outstanding characteristic 
of our republic is its public school system and he expressed the view 
that if our nation is to endure indefinitely it will be because of the broad 
democratic training and education in our public school system that we 
are giving to all the citizens of our nation. 

PUBLIC EDUCATION NOT ENOUGH 

But there are those who have strong convictions that public school 
education alone is not enough to preserve indefinitely and in peace, the 
life, the liberty and the prosperity of this our beloved country, the United 
States of America. Many are of the opinion that other elements are 
necessary. Religion, morality, righteousness ! These are elements which 
must be factors in the make-up of any nation, it is said, if that nation 
is to endure indefinitely. 

Experience has taught that morality is the life of a nation and 
religion is the life of morality. "Arming a country with guns and tanks 
and airplanes is not enough," says Roger W. Babson. Selecting men 
for the army, the navy and the air force on physical fitness alone will 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



39 



not suffice. "If our defense program is to succeed," he continues, "the 
entire country must experience a re-birth, for in the end, only righteous- 
ness can save a nation." 

REVELATIONS PERTAINING TO THIS LAND 

Our modern revelations, as recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants 
of the restored Church, (Section 58) declare that this is the land upon 
which the Zion of God shall stand. The faithful are to have this land 
as an inheritance for their children forever and forever. Here the poor 
and the lame and the blind and the deaf are "to partake of the supper 
of the Lord." But in this land, these revelations tell us, the law of the 
Lord must be obeyed, and here, the record says, no man is to be in 
bondage to any other man, and it declares that the Constitution of our 
country was prepared under divine guidance. The Prophet Joseph 
when dedicating the Kirtland Temple prayed that the Lord would have 
mercy on all the nations of the earth, and he appealed especially for the 
Lord to have mercy upon this our own government, so that the principles 
of freedom and justice for all men guaranteed by the Constitution of the 
United States might be "established forever." 

Then again, the inspired words of the Book of Mormon assure 
us that inasmuch as we live the righteous life and keep the Lord's com- 
mandments, we shall prosper here in America which the Lord says again 
and again is "a land choice above all other lands." The faithful, accord- 
ing to this divine record, are to enjoy this as a land of their inheritance 
and adds that this "land of promise" is for them and for their faithful 
children forever. Those faithful ones who have been "gathered here 
from other nations" are also to enjoy this as a land of liberty. The 
righteous inhabitants of this country, this inspired record continues, 
"shall never be brought down into captivity." Here "there shall be none 
to molest them," none to "take away this, the land of their inheritance." 

A LAND OF PROMISE 

It is gratifying and satisfying to us who have faith in the inspired 
words of this divine record, the Book of Mormon, to read further that 
"This land shall be fortified against all other nations," it shall be a land 
of liberty and upon it there shall be no king. This inspired book says 
further that God has preserved this country for a righteous people, and 
that whatever nation shall possess this land of America, shall serve God 
or else that nation "shall be swept away." "Whatsoever nation shall 
possess this land," the divine record continues, "shall be free from 
bondage, and from captivity and from all other nations under heaven, 
if they will but serve the God of this land who is Jesus Christ." 

Our fathers came to this land of promise and under divine guidance, 
as we believe, they established our Constitution and government which 
guarantee freedom, liberty and justice to all men. Having been led and 
guided by providence very appropriately they adopted these words as 
the motto of our country, "In God We Trust," and it is fitting therefore 
that the people of our nation sing : 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 

First Day 

Our father's God to Thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To Thee we sing ; 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light, 
Protect us by Thy might, 
Great God, our King ! 

COERCION IN GOVERNMENT NOT THE LORD'S WAY 

The Lord Himself has always favored government by the people. 
You will remember that in the days of Samuel the Prophet the Lord 
instructed him to let the people have whatever form of government they 
desired. They clamored for a dictator, a king, and because the Lord 
respected the right of free-will and human choice, because He recognized 
the right of men to govern themselves, and that it is better that humanity 
be self-governed, even though they are poorly governed, than to be com- 
pelled to obey even the divine law, He told the Prophet to let the people 
have a king, a dictator, since they insisted upon it. And the Bible tells us 
that after the decision of the Israelites to have a king, their dictatorial 
rulers wasted the substance of the people, they took away their personality 
and their freedom, and oppressed them with heavy taxes and other 
burdens. Instead of making a government for the people, as in a democ- 
racy, the people became the subjects of the dictators who did not rule 
for the good of the many but to bring power, wealth and idleness to a 
few. 

Our government is founded on the principle laid down by the Lord 
Himself : that a man is capable of self-government. This is in harmony 
with the divine intent expressed by the Creator when He said : 

Let us make man in our image, after our likeness and let them 
have dominion . . . over all the earth. 

This important statement of man's right and ability to rule is 
expressed in our Declaration of Independence thus : "Governments derive 
their just powers from the consent of the governed." And no doubt 
those forms of government in which there is an assumption to rule 
without the consent of those who are to be governed are responsible for 
that forceful expression, "Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God." 

PROVISION MADE FOR THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT 

Wisely did our forefathers organize our national institution with 
three different, distinct departments, each one to be entirely separate 
from and independent of the other two. These three departments are 
the Legislative, the Executive and the Judicial. These able and far- 
seeing patriots and statesmen thus made these three separate and distinct 
departments the cornerstone of our republic and the guarantee that in 
our land there shall never be a dictator. 

Among those who created this great free government were Puritans 
whose ancestors had struggled for generations in England and in Hol- 
land to secure the right to think, the right to be free, and the right to 



40 

Friday. October 4 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



41 



worship God in whatever way they saw fit. In England, in those early 
days, non-conformity with the rules, regulations, beliefs and doctrines of 
the established Church was neither permitted nor tolerated. Puritanism 
contained the principle of true religious toleration. And doubtless the 
ultimate tendency of the views of the Puritans was to republicanism 
rather than to monarchy although in England the Church and the State 
were considered one and inseparable. 

Eight restless years the Pilgrims spent in Holland where they had 
gone to find religious liberty and free government. They discovered 
soon, however, that for them Holland could not be a permanent home. 
Bradford says that when they looked toward America they were actuated 
by a great hope and an intense inward zeal to lay a good foundation 
in those then remote parts of the world for the propagating and the 
advancing of "the gospel of the Kingdom of Christ." They struggled 
to prepare stepping stones, at least, to assist others in the accomplishment 
of this great and important gospel service. 

Thus were the Puritans inspired to come to America and here 
help to prepare a people and frame a government providing such religious 
tolerance that it was possible for God the Father and His Son Jesus 
Christ to come to these United States and here restore and establish the 
Gospel in its original fulness. Under these just and liberal laws it was 
possible for the ancient church to be established again with all its keys, 
rights and authority to teach, preach and proclaim the fundamentals 
of righteousness in preparation for the coming again of our Lord and 
Master who is to bring joy, happiness and peace to the world. 

TWO ANTAGONISTIC FORCES AT WAR 

These great present-day battles, to which I have referred, the 
greatest of all time, are contests between two forces which are utterly 
antagonistic. One of these is impelled by the despotic passion to rule 
mankind and rob human beings of their free agency, and the other 
has for its cherished ideal the right and ability of man to rule himself. 
The one contemplates government dominated by dictators ; the other is 
the plan of the Almighty who created men free and equal and endowed 
them with the right and the intelligence to be their own sovereigns. 
The Creator never intended that a tyrant should assume the role of 
dictator and lord it over the sons and daughters of God under the 
despotic motto : "Might makes right." 

Our forefathers interpreted this great fundamental principle of 
freedom for mankind in these words: 

All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with 
certain inalienable rights. To secure these, governments are instituted 
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. 
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, 
it is the right of the people to abolish it. 

The aim of our patriotic fathers was to establish a government 
that would guarantee to them and to their descendants to the last genera- 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Day 

tion freedom, security, and happiness. They expressed their feelings 
in the Declaration of Independence which says: 

Appealing to the supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our 
intentions, we do in the name and by the authority of the good people of 
these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these United States are 
and of right ought to be free and independent states. 

. And the exalted republican principles for which these great and 
mighty leaders stood are thus expressed : 

We the people of the United States in order to secure the blessings of 
liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this Con- 
stitution for the United States of America. 

JESUS PROMOTED THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND 

Christ Himself did not come to the great and to the mighty of the 
earth; He came to humble shepherds who were watching their flocks 
by night. But for His teachings, His announcement and defense of the 
sacred right of all men, you and I today might be the slaves of tyrants, 
the bondsmen of cruel masters. Clarence True Wilson said : 

From the scorching fires of every persecution there has arisen some 
leader with a tongue of fire who has been inspired by the love of Jesus 
Christ to call men to a higher, a purer and a better life. Jesus promoted 
the rights of mankind. He is the Creator, he is the Architect of the 
republican form of government. 

His Church stands on the principle of human brotherhood. He 
taught that he who humbleth himself shall be exalted, that this world of 
ours is for us all and not for a select few. No one ever chose for his 
followers and associates men less gifted, more simple, plain and humble 
than did Jesus when he selected his twelve Apostles. And yet see into 
what heroic, noble, able, death-defying characters they became. Thus 
the Savior Himself demonstrated that the humblest men may develop 
into the highest characters. He had high regard for the plain people. 
Every example He set, every doctrine He taught was, it seems, intended 
to show that genuine greatness is in the act of service. He taught the 
equality of men and the dignity of those who are poor and stricken. 
The longest sermon he ever preached was delivered, it is said, to a motley 
crowd of peasants and fishermen. To this audience of ordinary people 
he gladly gave those great ideas and ideals contained in that matchless 
religious appeal, the Sermon on the Mount. - 

THE CHURCH AND THIS GOVERNMENT 

Our nation, our country and this Church, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, seem to conform to what was predicted 
and specified by the ancient prophets. We verily believe that in our 
present combination of Church and government we have what the Proph- 
et Daniel said had been shown to King Nebuchadnezzar in his famous 
dream. The king was shown things that are to come to pass in these 
latter days. Many nations and many kingdoms are to be destroyed, 
but the God of Heaven is to set up a Kingdom which shall never be 



\ 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



43 



destroyed, a Kingdom that shall not be left to other people, a Kingdom 
that shall break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms, and, the 
Prophet adds, it is a Kingdom that shall stand forever. It is the stone 
cut out of the mountain without hands, the stone that is to become 
a great mountain; yes, the prophet says it is the stone that is to 
fill the whole earth. (Daniel 2) It is our belief that this refers 
to our own land, choice above all other lands, and to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, with its principles of free agency and self- 
government. 

PEACE ACHIEVED THROUGH UNSELFISHNESS 

And now, in the name of Him who is our only King, Jesus the Son 
of God, let us as members of the Church and as citizens of this great 
nation, unite in an appeal to our heavenly Father, with whom nothing 
is impossible, to bring to us and to all mankind that glorious blessing 
of peace, good will and understanding, for which righteous people all 
over the world these days are so devoutly praying. And when making 
these our heartfelt, prayerful appeals may we never -forget that only 
by living unselfish lives, by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, 
visiting the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and extending 
to all men their God-given liberty, can we hope to secure joy and 
happiness and everlasting peace. 

By our faithfulness and devotion to these righteous principles may 
we bring to our beloved nation and to the distressed people of all the 
world these choice blessings, I humbly pray, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen. 

ELDER MARVIN O. ASHTON 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been impressed as you have by the services thus far this 
afternoon, and of course what was said this morning. I do not know 
what part of President Clark's talk impressed you most, but I know 
what gave me the most comfort. It was when he said : "I will now speak 
and take a hand in putting myself out of misery." Shocked as I was in 
hearing one of the Authorities make such an intimation, I thought, "Well 
that certainly helps some of the rest of us out." After all, as someone 
has said, "There is as much human nature in one of us as the rest of us." 

There are two things that a person prays for in trying to fill this 
speaking responsibility. One is, he prays that he will feel at ease to the 
extent that he might say what he would like to say ; and, second, that what 
he does say may be tempered with inspiration from above that he will 
be wise in saying nothing that would be improper. I certainly pray 
that I may be blessed in these two regards this afternoon. 

VISITS TO STAKES BRING ENCOURAGEMENT 

The Presiding Bishopric have been going through the Church con- 
siderably lately. We see what is going on here, and what is going on 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Day 

there, and of course in some of these places we see what is not going 
on. It is a wise observation that we should not be pessimists. We are 
cautioned to observe the bread part of the doughnut as well as the hole. 
Now it is not my purpose in any sense to be a pessimist. I want to 
appreciate the food of the doughnut as well as the space inside. 

When you see two hundred lads of the Aaronic Priesthood take part 
in a chorus in a Stake conference, you begin to realize that somebody is at 
work with boys. When you see some Stakes do outstanding things you 
thank God for such leadership. The other day in one of the Stakes I 
called at a little home and saw sitting on the floor three deep — they had 
to sit on the floor to be accommodated in the house — about fifty-five 
to sixty young people, ninety per cent of whom having attended their 
sacrament meeting this night, now assembled in a Book of Mormon 
class, wholesomely conducted by themselves. You see those things and 
you are impressed. 

When you see a little Bishop stand up and say that he could account 
for every one of his Lesser Priesthood boys for the past ten years, and 
each one of them js wholesome, clean, and sweet, it makes you appreciate 
what some people are doing. Of course that sounds pretty much like 
the fellow they tell about crossing the plains, driving a swarm of bees. 
He contended he did not lose a bee. But I believe that Bishop. God 
bless him ! 

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PICTURE 

Now for just a minute let us look at the inside of the doughnut. 
You cannot ostrich-like put your, head under the sand and say there is no 
danger about you. You have to take facts as they are. There is a fact 
thrown out to you and to me that is a challenge, and I mention it. This 
is our work; I mean the Aaronic Priesthood. It is the work of the 
Presiding Bishopric. There are right now 36,733 adult Aaronics in this 
Church of record; men twenty years of age and above who are not Elders 
or hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. May I remind you that the average 
attendance at sacrament meeting of these men is five per cent. I have 
too much sense to condemn that group of men. The best gold we have, 
we' shall find in those men if we dig down deep enough and use the right 
process in "smelting the ore." Now there is a challenge to you. 

Another way of saying it is that out of ten boys from twelve to 
twenty you are really teaching or training only six the way you should. 
Now put that figure in front of us — 36,733. Look at it sideways, from 
the front and from the back, any way you want to look at it ! It is there 
staring us straight in the eye. Someone has said, "Let us have the 
strength to face a fact though it kills us." Let us face the facts. 

Now what about your pedagogy, what about your human kindness, 
what about your boys' men — ability, and all the rest of the virtues that 
we of ttimes brag about ? I ask you the question, where is it all ? Where 
are those other four ? Why don't we touch their lives more successfully 
than we do? 



ELDER MARVIN 0. ASHTON

APPEAL FOR BETTER LEADERSHIP 

Sometimes I think we give the boys an acid test and a burning test. 
Let me explain what I understand that means: If you will take a bone 
that has stood on an anthill for three or more years, (I don't care how 
dry it is), and you soak it in muriatic acid, as dry as that bone is you 
can tie it in a knot. You have nothing but gristle or animal matter left. 
Now take what you have left and put the torch under it and you haven't 
very much left of that bone. The muriatic acid in one case eats up the 
mineral or the lime, and the burning eats up the animal matter. 

Now that is just what some of us do with boys. I am looking now 
at the inside of the doughnut. I am looking at those things we do not 
do. I am keeping in mind all the time some of the fine things that we do. 
You give the boy the acid test and then the burning test. Now let us 
see what we mean by the acid test. Here is one : — you give the boy 
improper supervision. Someone has said, "We are not shepherds, we 
are sheep herders." We "taketh" them not down into green pastures, 
but we "draggeth" them over cacti and rocks, and before we get through 
with them, their mouths are Heeding from briars and thorns we "suf- 
fereth" them to eat. Sometimes if you get a good boys' man for the boys, 
along comes a petty vacancy in the Ward and you let him go. Somebody 
suffers. There is not a bigger job in this Church than taking care of these 
boys. The boy of today is the man of tomorrow. When our deacon 
comes to his quorum meeting, too many times he is met with an unpre- 
pared program. He is met too many times with a leader who knows little 
or nothing about boy psychology or the first principles of getting his 
interest. We fumble him about with our clumsiness and lack of con- 
sistent follow-up until up his sleeve, while he respects us, his soul rebels 
against our promiscuousness. 

When you see these figures — just four out of ten — you may think 
of that poem, "The Charge of the Light Brigade," and say to yourself, 
"Someone has blundered." We'll have to wake up; we'll have to put 
more life into our stewardship, if you please, of these boys. I cannot 
think of anything that better illustrates what I want to say than a story 
that has been told before. I apologize for alluding to it again, but it 
may crystallize better what I am trying to say. 

A Scotch minister had trouble with a good brother in his congre- 
gation who would go to sleep. The minister stood it as long as he could.. 
Finally he called Sandy to him and told him he would have to stop 
going to sleep ; he could not stand it any longer ; that he was setting a 
bad example. The brother insisted he couldn't help it. Finally the 
minister's eyes brightened, and he thought he had some real inspiration. 
Said he : "When you come to Church next time, bring a little snuff in a 
can; and when you feel yourself getting drowsy, just apply a little bit 
of snuff in your nose." 

Then his good church patron had some inspiration and he came 
back with: "Wouldn't it be an awful good thing if you'd put a wee 
bit o' snuff into your sermons." We'll have to put more snuff in our 
teaching of boys. 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Day 

I wouldn't have a lad that wouldn't wiggle, and if you think the 
way some of you folks take care of this wiggling lad, the way you handle 
him is right, you are sadly mistaken. I hate to say it, but I do not hesitate 
for one minute. I have seen conditions that warrant my saying it. The 
leadership sometimes of these boys is dead on its feet. We do get into 
ruts, and boys that look for a little spark of animation from us are disap- 
pointed. 

In a lecture that was delivered before a hospital convention the 
other night, a wise observation was made by the speaker. He spoke in 
hospital terms because they understood them. He warned them against 
a disease altogether too prevalent. This ailment has afflicted too many 
men who are supposed to lead boys. The lecturer said : "If you get the 
disease there is no need of being vaccinated ; that won't do you any good ; 
they cannot operate ; when you get this disease, the only thing you can 
do is to blast. Now here is the disease : it is metallurgic fever. It is the 
condition in the body where the iron in the body turns to lead and centers 
in the seat of the trousers." 

Here is another way of saying the same thing: 

Man was not made to sit entranced 
And press, and press, and press his pants, 
But rather with an open mind 
To circulate among his kind. 
So, my friend, beware the snare 
That lurks within the cushioned chair. 
To run the race it has been found 
Both feet must be upon the ground. 

THE TRUE STORY OF A BOY 

Now I say these things seriously. We ourselves are in a deep 
slumber and we expect to keep awake a wiggling, wholesome, American 
boy. That is an acid test. What may be another acid test ? — not putting 
the proper value on a boy. Do you look to the value of the heart that 
beats under his coat, or do you see only the outside of the coat ? Many 
a good mother misjudges a boy because he is not a Lord Fauntleroy. 
Because he doesn't keep his hair combed, you think he is on the road 
downward. Sometimes you do not . see him as he really is. He puts 
his worst foot forward; he is in the "ugly duckling" stage. But if he 
were treated anywhere near right, he would develop into a bird of - real 
plumage and grace. 

To illustrate : A little girl of the slums was found dangerously sick. 
There must be a blood transfusion at once. Her ragged urchin brother 
was accosted: — would he give his blood for his sister? "Sure," he 
thundered back. After they had worked on his arm for a few minutes, 
its whiteness, because of the wash, he had not witnessed before, almost 
frightened him to death. The pumping apparatus was set to work and 
his sister revived. When he learned that his sister fared well, notice 
the deep-seated surprise back to the doctor. (I hope you get it.) "Fine, 
Doc, but when do I croak?" 

Do you in judging look at the thread-bare ragged apparel, or are you 



ELDER MARVIN 0. ASHTON

bent on discerning the sacrificing thump of the heart that beats deeper 
down in his soul? 

Christ said that no greater thing can any man do than to give his 
life for his fellows. That young lad thought that when he was asked to 
give his blood for his sister, it meant that he was giving his life. We in 
our civilization box the ears of the lad until his ear drums are numb 
and he is deaf the rest of his life, and that same fellow is the man who 
gives you your electric light today. We put a dunce cap on an Einstein, 
and our schools court martial the boy who may be the military general 
of tomorrow, who cuts through smoke and shrapnel to victory and makes 
this the "land of the free and the home of the brave." 

Not understood. Poor souls with stunted vision 

Oft measure giants by their narrow gauge ; 
The poisoned shafts of falsehood and derision 

Are oft impelled 'gainst those who mould the age 
Not understood. 

Not understood. How many hearts are aching 

For lack of sympathy? Ah, day by day 
How many cheerless, lonely hearts are breaking 

How many noble spirits pass away 
Not understood. 

Oh God, that man would see a little clearer 
Or judge less harshly where they cannot see, 

Oh God, that men would draw a little nearer 
To one another, they'd be nearer Thee 
Not understood. 

With this boy is our vision stunted and do we measure him by our 
narrow gauge? Fathers and mothers, you make some mistakes. Teachers 
in schools, and we in the Church should see a little clearer and judge less 
harshly. 

TEACHERS MAY INFLUENCE BY EXAMPLE 

Now to the burning test to this lad : I mention it as the third test, 
but not the least. The burns that take place here go down into the bone. 
Now I am speaking of the example that we set as the teachers of this 
boy. What kind of men do your Bishops pick to teach these boys? 
what kind of life are we, whom the boy is supposed to look up to, living ? 
If you please, will our lives "hold water?" Do we have a long face on 
the Sabbath day and in holy places, and play a different tune in our 
conduct in the affairs of men in the ordinary business of life? In my 
judgment there is nothing doing more harm in this Church today than 
men who are trying to play a double game. The boy always finds it out. 
You can't fool him. By our conduct we often pull up by the roots the 
most precious sprouts of confidence ever germinated. 

To illustrate what I am driving at : Maybe some of you remember 
Deacon Jones, who is mentioned in the book, "David Harum." He was 
a sanctimonious, wonderful fellow on the Sabbath day, but during the 
week you had to hold on tight to your eyebrows or he would take them 
too — one of those two-faced "angelic" souls that grace this world ; the 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, October 4 First Day 

kind Christ speaks of in his rebuke to the old Pharisees ; a front as pious 
as apple sauce, but a trail on the sands of time of dead men's bones. 
He was on his deathbed ; he was doomed to go. He had made quite an 
impression on some of the village who did not think very straight; but 
he did not fool the boys. The boys had his number. He began to sink, 
and sink, and finally he got so low that instead of answering the doorbell 
or the knock on the door by the inquirers, they had a blackboard put out 
in front of his abode. Every half hour the attending physician gave his 
temperature and his pulse. There was quite a commotion in the village, 
everybody was watching that blackboard. Well, the boys watched it, too, 
and they ~were waiting for an opportunity to express themselves. (If 
you ever want to get the proper value on yourself, ask the boys.) I think 
the last bulletin read, "8:05 a. m. — pulse 50, temperature 86." When 
nobody was looking, a bright lad, with mischief bent, who knew the 
Deacon, slipped up with a piece of chalk, and excitingly recorded : "8 :22i/2 
a. m. Much excitement in hell; Deacon Jones not yet arrived." 

As Bobbie Burns put it, "The man of independent mind looks and 
laught at a. that." 

DISCIPLINE MOLDS CHARACTER 

Now I would not have you think for a minute that I want you to 
pamper this boy. Let him stand on his own feet. One man said : "One 
of the greatest crops that America is reaping today is the spoiled child." 
Some of you people who have worked all your lives are as guilty as the 
man of wealth. You say, "I have had such a hard time in my life that 
I certainly won't let my children go through the same thing." And the 
spoiling process goes on. I do not think that we appreciate to the full 
extent what this means. Does your girl or boy know how to spell 
"gratitude" ? Do you let your boy fight for what he gets, or do you hand 
him all his desires on a silver platter. 

I remember at our home, for years and years, we had a cow. (I 
won't forget the cow because of certain responsibilities I had connected 
with it.) Every time a calf would come to town, father would in the 
course of events send at the proper time for the butcher. But there was 
one little heifer that father said we would keep. When that animal 
was about nine months old, father came home one day with a big strap 
with spikes driven from the inside out. He said that it was to go over 
the calf's nose. In other words, the day had arrived when the calf must 
be weaned. I wonder sometimes if we parents use the same philosophy 
on our children? Do we wean them? I am speaking now figuratively. 
Many a boy becomes eighteen, or twenty, goes through school, and, if 
you please, remains not weaned. Many a boy is spoiled because you 
can't spank grandmothers. Yes, too, because you can't spank parents. 
Until the last few years, I have thought that the cow ought to have worn 
the strap and the spikes ought to center in that part of her anatomy 
that the calf was most interested in. But I have changed my mind entirely, 
I think that as far as the children are concerned, the strap still belongs 
over their noses with the spikes going out. Parents should be painfully 



ELDER MARVIN 0. ASHTON 



49 



reminded when the occasion arises that the weaning is in process. America 
will learn before she gets through that her children should know more 
than stepping on the gas, smoking Turkish blends, and ordering up choco- 
late eclairs and tutti-fruitis. Yes, and what's true of the children of Uncle 
Sam is doubly true of this Church. 

I took a piece of plastic clay 
And idly fashioned it one day, 
And as my fingers pressed it still 
It moved and yielded to my will. 
I came again when days were past, 
The bit of clay was hard at last ; 
The form I gave it still it bore 
But I could change it never more. 

I took a piece of human clay 

And gently formed it day by day ; 

I molded with my power and art 

A young child's warm and yielding heart. 

I came again when days were gone, 

It was a man I looked upon. 

The form I gave him still he bore ; 

But I could change him never more. 

Now, may the Lord bless us in this boys' business. Don't forget 
while we are putting the acid test and the burning test on this lad, tobacco 
shoots her shrapnel, liquor drops bombs from the sky, and then you 
find indolence and bad habits walk arm in arm with the boy to destruction. 

Let's handle this boy more scientifically. Let's give him more 
attention. He's more valuable than our crops, our hogs, and our business. 
He is the man of tomorrow. Give him the right start. The boy is like a 
zipper; start him right and he'll come through. Don't jerk him, you 
might tear the meshes and then you haven't a track to travel on. 

May God help us to hold these boys, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel very happy, my brethren and sisters, in my religion and the 
association I have with you this morning in worshiping the Lord in 
General Conference of His Church. Personally I appreciate your attend- 
ance at this Conference. I enjoyed very greatly, with others of my 
brethren and their wives, greeting about seven thousand five hundred 
people, leaders of the Church, at a reception held in the Hotel Utah 
Thursday evening ; and I suppose you are all here, or most of you, today. 
To me it is an evidence of your faithfulness, brethren and sisters, and 
appreciation -of the Gospel, realizing that many of you have come from 
afar, great distances, and at more or less expense, and I believe that 
you have come in discharge of a sacred religious duty, and with a desire 
to mingle with the Saints of God, and to worship Him in His appointed 
way. 

FAITHFUL LATTER-DAY SAINTS COMMENDED 

I feel full of blessing for you and all the faithful Saints. I know 
the integrity of the Latter-day Saints, the sacrifices that many of them 
are making for the Gospel's sake. May God bless you and reward you 
abundantly therefor, and keep you in the faith. Those who are indifferent 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



51 



and careless in regard to their religion, I hope that the Spirit of the Lord 
will strive with them, that men in high places of responsibility will strive 
with them, and that they may be brought into real activity and apprecia- 
tion of the Gospel, and take advantage of their opportunities in making 
their calling and election sure, while they are here and have the oppor- 
tunity, and I desire to be one with them. 

I suppose that we are all candidates for the highest degree of glory 
in the Celestial kingdom. In order to attain to those heights we must 
serve the Lord and work the works of righteousness, as outlined by 
the Gospel which the Lord has given us for our guide. 

One of the articles of our f aith reads : 

We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may 
be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EVIDENCES OF THE GOSPEL 

There are, I may say, two principal incentives for men to yield 
obedience Unto the Gospel in order to obtain salvation. We may say 
the one is the external and the other the internal evidences of the Gospel. 
If we ever attain to a fulness of glory it must be by the keeping of the 
commandments of the Lord, by living by every word that proceedeth 
forth from His mouth. We must have faith in order to do so. Faith 
is the first principle of revealed religion, the foundation of all righteous- 
ness, and the moving cause of all action. Faith comes by the word of 
God. Hence we preach and teach, that men and women may have faith, 
that they may repent of their sins, yield obedience unto the laws and 
ordinances of the Gospel, and through the atonement of Jesus Christ 
obtain eternal life and exaltation. 

The internal evidences of the Gospel are experienced by those who 
have received the Gospel, and they have the benefits of the external 
evidences as well ; while those who are non-members of this Church have 
practically but the external evidences. 

When I speak of internal evidences, I regard the Holy Ghost as 
the soul of Mormonism, and Mormonism is the Church and Kingdom of 
God established on the earth, with the everlasting Gospel restored in 
these last days. 

We look at a man of fine physique and personality and admire him, 
but we do not know his real worth until we become acquainted with 
him and learn that he is a man of character, a man of integrity to truth 
and the principles of righteousness, and then we love him more dearly. 

THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE HOLY GHOST 

People on the outside look at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints and admire its organization, its institutions, its accomplish- 
ments ; but they have not felt as the Latter-day Saints have felt, who 
have embraced the Gospel and helped to make Mormonism what it is 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

today. When a person has had faith to repent of his sins, and yielded 
obedience in the waters of baptism, and had hands laid upon him by 
those having authority, for confirmation to membership in the Church, 
and received the Holy Ghost, it is his right, through continued faith- 
fulness, to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost with him all the 
time, to be, as it were, a lamp to his feet and a light to his path through 
life, to know the course that he should pursue, and have strength and 
power to pursue that course. 

That is the will of the Lord, and I understand what the Lord meant, 
when He said : "He that doeth the will of the Father shall know of His 
doctrine"- — it meant that very thing. Those who have taken that course 
in sincerity do know, by the revelations of the Lord, through the Holy 
Ghost, that His course is right, in accepting of the Gospel ; that this work 
in which we are engaged is indeed the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

The scriptures tell us: "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, 
except by the Holy Ghost." I bear you my testimony, brethren and 
sisters, that I do know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, and added 
evidences of the Gospel, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer 
of the world. I feel that I know it just as well and by the same means 
that Peter knew, when the Savior asked His disciples : 

Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 

* * * * * 

And Simon Petter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
of the living God. 

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon- 
Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven. 

MEN KNOWN BY THEIR FRUITS 

The Savior gave a test that people who are not members of the 
Church might apply in their investigation of the Gospel, particularly 
in regard to prophets, that they might know a true prophet from a 
false one. It is contained in the seventh chapter of Matthew, where He 
said : 

Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, 
but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 

Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 

Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt 
tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 

A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree 
bring forth good fruit. 

Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and 
cast into the fire. 

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. 

By the fruits of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
its membership, we may be known as God's people, and this work as 
His work.

THE PROPHET ISAIAH QUOTED 

I desire to read to you, brethren and sisters, a few words from 
the prophecy of Isaiah, who spoke under the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost and for the Lord, so that this that I am going to read to you is the 
word of the Lord, and was intended for us. I read from the twenty-ninth 
chapter : 

Stay yourselves, and wonder ; cry ye out, and cry ; they are drunken, 
but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 

For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and 
hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he 
covered. 

And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that 
is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, 
I pray thee : and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed : 

And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read 
this, I pray thee : and he saith, I am not learned. 

Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me 
with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed 
their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the 
precepts of men: 

Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people, even a marvelous work and a wonder ; for the wisdom of their 
wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall 
be hid. 

THE PROPHECY FULFILLED 

Those of us, brethren and sisters, who are familiar with the circum- 
stances surrounding the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the 
establishment of this work in the earth, can readily see in it a fulfilment 
of the word of the Lord as He spoke it through His servant, the prophet 
Isaiah. It was to be a marvelous work and a wonder that the Lord should 
bring forth at this particular time, when the Book of Mormon should 
come forth. The Book of Mormon itself contains a fulness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, as taught by Him to the ancient inhabitants of 
this American continent, and it is before the world today. 

In the beginning of this work, in the days of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, a wonderful work was accomplished. He laid the foundations for 
an ever growing and increasing organization and activities in the Church 
intended for the honor and glory of our Father in heaven. He was taken 
away in early manhood. He gave unto us the revelations of the Lord, for 
our guidance. At the time of his death there was but one auxiliary 
organization in the Church, that of the Relief Society. That organization 
has become a marvelous organization. Yes, I may say it has become 
a marvel in the eyes of men and women within and without the Church. 

ORGANIZATIONS PERFECTED 

It was in the days of President Brigham Young that the Sunday 
School organization was established. It has grown and increased until 
it is a mighty organization in the earth, a marvelous work and a wonder, 
the like of which cannot be found anywhere else. 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

It was in President Brigham Young's day that the Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations were organized. 
Each of them has become a marvelous work and a wonder. 

It remained for the administration of President John Taylor to give 
to the Church the Primary organization, which is another marvelous 
work and a wonder in the earth today. 

DEVELOPMENT OF CHURCH UNDER PRESENT ADMINISTRATION 

It remained for President Heber J. Grant and his administration 
to carry on this great work in its development, increasing the Stakes and 
Wards of Zion. In the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith they had but 
one or two Stakes, and now we have a hundred thirty-two. They had a 
few Wards, and now we have more than a thousand Wards. We have 
Missions established, and for more than a century we have been carrying 
on at tremendous expense. Today we have something like two thousand 
missionaries constantly in the field. The expense to the Church and to 
the individual missionaries and their friends, valuing a missionary's time 
at $900.00 a year, reaches nearly $4,000,000.00 per annum. This gives 
evidence of the faith and the knowledge of the Latter-day Saints that 
they are engaged in God's work, and are willing to make sacrifices for its 
advancement in the earth. 

In the days of President Heber J. Grant and his administration 
there has been organized in the Stakes of Zion a missionary system, 
known as the Stake missionary work of the Church; and be it known, 
brethren and sisters and friends, according to the statistics of the Church, 
in the past two years, with fewer missionaries employed, there have been 
more converts made within the Stakes of Zion than in the mission field. 
If we compare the cost of maintaining the missionary work abroad, 
this work carried on at home is without practically any cost to the Church 
and its membership. The missionaries maintain themselves. They carry 
on their vocational work. They can sleep in their own beds at night, eat 
at their own tables, and the work goes forward, — a marvelous work 
and a wonder, to the credit of the present administration of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Another outstanding accomplishment in the administration of the 
present President of the Church is that of the Welfare work of the 
Church. Those of you who heard President Clark's talk yesterday 
morning upon this subject of the welfare work of the Church must have 
been convinced that it is indeed a marvelous work and a wonder, evidence 
that the present President of this Church has been divinely called as 
God's mouthpiece and prophet unto this people. Do we need these 
evidences? If so, we should make use of them and let them have their 
influence upon our minds, at least to lead us to a careful and thorough 
investigation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is preached today. 

This could not be accomplished, of course, by the leadership of the 
Church alone. It involves the faithfulness and integrity of the member- 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



55 



ship of the Church ; and may the Lord bless you, brethren and sisters, for 
such integrity and faithfulness. 

DUTY OF MEMBERSHIP OF THE CHURCH 

So this is the work of God, and it will go on, until God's purposes 
have been fully accomplished in the earth. It is for us as members of 
the Church to do our duty and to stand in holy places and watch the 
judgments of God go by. This we will do if we have the right spirit and 
are living our religion without any fear or trembling on our part, for 
we know that God will take care of His own. 

I bear my testimony to you, brethren and sisters, that I do know 
that this is God's work; that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living 
God ; that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and is and ever will be, 
as also his successors, one by one, down to the present time, and not 
the least among them President Heber J. Grant. Thank God for him. 
May he be preserved unto us and unto his work many years to come, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

Twice each year, for the last few years, I have had the privilege 
and pleasure of sitting and looking into your faces, and contemplating 
the things that are transpiring in your hearts. But I want to say to you 
now that it is greatly different from sitting and looking at you, in this 
position which I now occupy. Just a few feet above my seat makes con- 
siderable difference. 

There is one thing that we all have been contemplating, and I know 
that we have come to some definite conclusions concerning it, and that 
is the well-being and the safety of this people who have been gathered 
out from every nation and from every branch of people upon the earth, 
here to this land which has been consecrated and dedicated of God, our 
Eternal Father, for the gathering place of His own. I believe that we 
will come to the conclusion that we are perfectly safe in our daily walks 
and talks, if and when we devote ourselves to God's great work, in the 
right spirit. 

THE LIBERTY BELL 

You know that through one hundred and eighty-four years there 
has now come down to us a rather national emblem — ■ it has become 
almost a shrine. I speak of the old Liberty Bell, which, though voice- 
less for these many years, has served so well, and which was eagerly 
looked upon by the people on July 4th, 1776, as it rang forth its message 
that this country was in very deed free from tyranny and free from that 
which had caused mankind so much distress. You know it was brought 
from England in 1732, and it rested in the State House in Philadelphia 
for a number of years. Then in 1753 it cracked and was remolded by 
American workmen. This did not last very long. It cracked again, and 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Dag 



then was remolded. But the strange thing to me is this, that some twenty- 
five years prior to its being cast the last time, out of the scripture men 
sought that which was molded into its crown and that was, as it came 
from the holy writ : "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto the 
inhabitants thereof." 

Now, this bell was in use by the City of Philadelphia until July 
8th, 1836, when it cracked while being tolled at the funeral of Chief 
Justice John Marshall. 



It seems strange that God has prepared the way for His people, and 
perhaps strange to us that God is now preparing the way for His people, 
but such is the case. In the beginning of this earth of ours for this 
thing which God prepared for His children, He gave some definite, 
pointed instructions, and was rather jealous of what He said and what 
He desired, and to us have come these things which we would like to obey 
and love to keep. 

God has also given unto each of us the one and only tool by which we 
might gain honor and success and exaltation, or on the other hand, misery 
and disgrace and absolute degradation. Now, that tool is the free agency 
of man to choose between right and wrong, and God has safeguarded it, 
from time to time called our attention to it, and brought it home to us. 

LIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING TO BE STRIVEN FOR 

I read in the Doctrine and Covenants this : 

Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one 
another, and both are edified and repoice together. 

And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. 

That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and con- 
tinueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and 
brighter until the perfect day 

And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know 
the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you; 

He that is ordained of God and sent forth, the same is appointed to 
be the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant ol all. 

I feel that we should never imagine that we have seen the light at 
one time, and it becomes therefore unnecessary for us constantly to 
strive to glimpse those flashes from heaven that are coming to us, as they 
did in the past. I would that we might open the windows of our souls 
and receive that light which God desires to give and is giving to his people. 



You recall when Christ was with His Twelve, one thing that has 
always rather impressed itself upon me, was the time when the Twelve 
and Christ were together, and the Twelve, some of them were contending, 
one with the other, as to who might be on the right-hand side of God 
and who on the left, and these things were said: (This is in Mark, the 
tenth chapter.) 



FREE AGENCY A GIFT FROM GOD 



LEADERSHIP THROUGH SERVICE 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY

But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that 
they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over 
them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 

But so shall it not be among you ; but whosoever will be great among 
you, shall be your minister ; 

And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. 

The salvation of man is not brought about by force or coercion or the 
powers of dictatorship. These are not the methods God has used, nor are 
they the methods God will use. 

Refer to your Pearl of Great Price, and read in Moses that which 
God gave to us then : 

And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying : That Satan, whom thou 
hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was 
from the beginning, and he came before me, saying — Behold, here am I, 
send me. I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul 
shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor. 

But behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from 
the beginning, said unto me — Father, thy will be done, and the glory be 
thine forever. 

Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to 
destroy the agency of man, which I the Lord God, had given him, and also, 
that I sriould give unto him mine own power, by the power of mine Only 
Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down. 

Constantly there has come ringing into our ears these admonitions, 
these things, which bring us up standing, to realize that it is God who 
speaks to His people, to direct them and to cause that their minds may 
run in the proper channels. 

god's word given to his people 

The following was given in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith : 

Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that will hold him guiltless 
that obeys not my commandments? 

Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and have not fulfilled ? 

I command and men obey not ; I revoke and they receive not the bless- 
ing. 

Then they say in their hearts : This is not the work of the Lord, for his 
promises are not fulfilled. But woe unto such, for their reward lurketh 
beneath, and not from above. 

Now. these passages of scripture that I have read to you, I have read 
them for this one purpose, and they have led me to this thought, that 
every single last soul of us here, and all the members of this great Church 
of God, scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land, have 
seen the light, and we have had that light confirmed by the testimony of 
the Holy Ghost in our hearts and souls, that this is God's work, that God 
in His own way has wrought and brought to pass that which you and I 
now behold. 

Think of God's message. Think of His methods, the choosing of 
Moses, the call of Abraham, and the placing of Joseph sold into Egypt, 
the sending of His Only Begotten Son among the children of men, to

bring about that which Christ wrought, which is sung by the millions upon 
this earth here today. Then think of the marvelous thing that He did in 
His quiet, unostentatious manner ; how Moroni appeared to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, to bring forth this great work that you and I are now en- 
gaged in. 

All this being true, all this having been revealed to us, we knowing 
of its truth and virtue, I think is it quite necessary that we bring our- 
selves to understand that with the establishment here upon this earth of 
God's prophet, God's servants, we can say in our hearts that these 
are the servants of God, chosen absolutely and literally by Him for the 
guidance o'f His people here upon this earth. 

SUCCESS IN LOCAL MISSIONARY WORK 

Now, just one word: I am thrilled with that which has been told to 
you people by Brother Richards, Apostle George F. Richards, concerning 
the work which is going on here in the Stakes of Zion. Your sons and 
daughters have been sent abroad. They have been marvelously blessed. 
But here in your own Stakes, up and down these great stretches, your 
sons and husbands and daughters and wives are in this great missionary 
work, and up to July of this year we were just fifty-one baptisms 
ahead of the same time last year ; and during this last month one hundred 
ninety-four men joined this Church, who never knew of its truth before. 

So I rejoice, and say to you I feel that it is not necessary that we 
should feel overly concerned about what will happen to us, if we will 
do that which God desires us to do. 

God bless you, I pray in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I had rather half-heartedly cherished the idea that the broadcast 
tomorrow morning would be accepted as my contribution to this Confer- 
ence. It was almost the case six months ago, but five minutes at the last 
of the closing session saved the establishment of such a precedent, I 
am sorry to say. 

Usually when I occupy this position, which is at least once a week 
and often two or three times a week, I have the benefit of a radio script 
in front of me. It is much more comfortable, but not nearly so spon- 
taneous. I ask at this time that if the Lord has a message that He would 
like me to speak, He will prompt it. I feel very weak in addressing 
this congregation. 

THE NEED FELT FOR TRUE LEADERSHIP 

In our conduct of the Tabernacle Choir broadcast over the nation- 
wide Columbia network each Sunday morning, and over the nation-wide 
Canadian Radio Commission stations, and also by short wave and by 
electrical transcription across the seas and into other continents, we 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS

receive mail postmarked from almost every section of the globe, and 
literally from every nook and corner of America. 

This mail reveals that people are hungry for leadership, that they 
are searching earnestly for a foundation on which to place their feet, 
for a fixed destination toward which to strive, and that they are sick to 
death of the confusion and the contradiction that they see about them. 
This hunger for leadership in one sense is a very happy thing, and in 
another sense it may be a very dangerous thing. When people are in 
that frame of mind it makes it much easier for a false leader to win 
their following. 

I am impressed with the fact that our responsibility in this Church 
is the responsibility of leadership, and that we must take it, whatever 
it may cost us, because the Lord has told us that we have been sent to be 
a light unto the world and to be saviors of men ; and if we don't give 
this leadership, others will assume it, to the sorrow of mankind and to 
our own condemnation. I feel sure that this leadership must enter into 
all of the activities of living. 

President Clark mentioned here, yesterday morning, the fact that 
our fathers and grandfathers had prayed over the land and the water 
and the air, and all of the physical elements of production, much to their 
credit and to their blessing. I feel sure that we need to pray over a good 
many other things, including our scholarship, our academic activities, our 
political activities, our social activities. I am sure that we need to pray 
over every phase of thought and of life. 

It is a very difficult thing to take leadership in this day — so much 
is being discovered; so much is happening; so confused are the issues, I 
think it safe to say, without contradiction, that in a public sense we can't 
be sure of much of what we hear or much of what we see or much of what 
we read ; that the phrase, "evil and designing men," has a much broader 
application, than the limited sense in which we use it in connection with 
the Word of Wisdom. Those things that are printed and spoken to 
shape our thinking, in all fields of communication and human contact, 
are largely designed and colored and adulterated and modified to bring 
men into the line of thought of other men, often without regard to the 
facts or the truth of the matter in question. It is very difficult to know, 
and I think man unaided, of himself, and without some Higher Help, 
cannot know what to believe and what not to believe of the maze of 
material that daily passes before our eyes and comes within the range of 
our hearing. 

THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH 

A cherished friend of mine, whose life paralleled mine for many 
years, up to a few years ago, when there was a parting of the ways, is 
now in one of America's greatest institutions of learning, and has achieved 
international eminence in his scientific field. A few weeks ago he wrote 
me and said : "I am conducting researches in many fields, and I am just 
beginning to learn the high cost of finding out the truth about anything." 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

And he continued: "The problem is so complex that all we can do is 
arrive at half-truths and first approximations." 

I wrote him back and said : "It must be a great comfort to you, in 
your work, to know that you are a member of a Church that will accept 
everything of truth that you ever find in your researches, in whatever 
field of thought or activity, and all that we ask of you is to pursue them 
beyond that stage of half-truth and first approximations of which you 
have spoken, and conduct them to their final end, where there will be 
no question about their eternal verity — to that point where the generations 
to come will not of necessity repudiate them." 

I have a strong feeling that our young people who go into our 
universities and colleges should have before them constantly the promise 
of Moroni, that "by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth 
of all things," which is repeated in substance in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants to the effect that "the Holy Ghost . . . showeth all things and teach- 
eth the peaceable things of the kingdom." I never remember having 
gone into an examination of any consequence in my life without making 
it a matter of prayer. I know that the young man or young woman 
who approaches any problem in the academic field, or any other field, 
would have a great advantage if he would keep as his constant companion 
the spirit of our Father in heaven, which would give him an active sense 
of warm assurance when he was in the presence of truth, and would give 
him a contrary feeling when he was not in the presence of truth. It 
wouldn't give him knowledge without study, or discovery without search, 
or truth without effort, but, granted that he pursued his work intelli- 
gently and diligently, he would have a great advantage in all of his 
findings and doings, academically and otherwise, if he made the spirit 
of all truth his constant guide. 

STRENGTH COMES THROUGH PRAYER 

This is the thing the Latter-day Saints have that helps them to take 
leadership regardless of the confusion and the contradiction about us. 
I know that in my home my widowed mother was constantly in an 
attitude of prayer. My most vivid memory of her — and I cherish it 
dearly — is a memory of her on her knees, pleading with the Lord, her 
Father in heaven, for a solution to the many problems and difficulties 
that beset her life. I suppose that I had had as much formal education 
by the time I was fourteen years old, in terms of days spent in school, 
as she had had in all her life, and yet after I had had the privilege of 
acquiring university degrees I could still go to her when I was troubled, 
and find the right counsel and the right answers to whatever was con- 
fronting me, and I am grateful to have had such a mother and such a 
home, and to have had evidence of the effectiveness of that approach, 
that promise which through prayer and through diligence and through 
walking in the ways of our Father, makes it possible for the Latter-day 
Saints to assume leadership, and we can do it in no other way, except 
by keeping constantly in touch with the spirit of our Father in heaven, 
by which we may know the truth of all things. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



61 



This is our promise, if we live for it. It is the means whereby we 
can take leadership in spiritual matters, in economic affairs, in social 
conditions, and in all the ways of life — and the only way. 

SAFETY IN FOLLOWING TRUE LEADERSHIP 

Besides this we have our living prophet, for whom I am grateful, 
and I hope to follow after him all the days of my life. I know that when 
I don't follow him I am wrong, and I know that when I do I am right, 
even if I don't agree with him. To those who only follow him when 
they do agree with him he is not a prophet unto them. I am grateful to 
the Lord for preserving the life of President Grant. I know that the 
leadership of this people is a responsibility that weighs heavily upon 
him, and that he would avoid it if he could, ofttimes, but he has no choice 
in the matter ; and by looking to his counsel and example we may also 
be helped to know when we are right and when we are not right in the 
presence of all the confusion we see about us. 

I wish to leave you my testimony that I know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that He shall one day reign upon this earth, in His 
own time, and that all those things that the prophets have spoken in all 
generations will come to pass, regardless of the belief or unbelief of 
men; and that he who leads us today speaks for God in the affairs of 
this world in this generation. 

May the Lord bless you and be with you and help you to give' the 
leadership that the Lord intends that you shall give, lest others take it, 
and lest we thereby be condemned for not having taken the place that 
was rightfully ours, and for which we had the guidance if we had lived 
according to the laws of God, our Father. 

May He bless us all. I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A bartone solo: If Christ Came Back Today," (by O'Hara), was 
sung by Elder Walter Welti. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This crowded house on a week-day with beautiful weather, is an 
answer to the cry of the ancient prophet of Israel : "There is faith in 
Israel." It is good to be one of you in this, the Church of Christ. 

I have been impressed to speak to a theme which may not be strictly 
spiritual, but which in its relations to Gospel living seems to me to be of 
prime importance. 

PREPAREDNESS A PART OF THE GOSPEL PLAN 

Preparedness is today on every tongue. There is danger ahead, and 
defenses must be set up. Preparedness is not a new word to Latter-day 
Saints. For one hundred and ten years our voice has been one of warning 
to prepare against the commotion and calamities of the last days. We 
have taught and continue to teach that full preparedness and complete 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

defense against the devastation by evil is the acceptance of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. When every knee shall bow and every tongue confess 
that Jesus is the Christ we may look for the peace of Eden, but not before. 

Our land is setting up defenses of powder and steel. That is well 
enough. But there are intangible defenses more powerful which direct 
the use of material defenses. These must be fostered, if our preparedness 
shall be adequate. To one of these defenses I call your attention — to 
the education we give our children, particularly in schools, as a determin- 
ing defense against evil. 

TRUE EDUCATION A PROTECTION AGAINST EVIL 

Latter-day Saints believe in education ; the Church itself is but a 
great teaching institution. We understand that to learn we must be 
taught ; and also that our actions are determined largely by the teachings 
we receive. Therefore, we teach our children as a preparation for life. 

The example was set by the Lord. When Adam and Eve were 
placed in the Garden of Eden, in forgetfulness of their past, the Lord 
came and taught them the Gospel. This was done again later, to others, 
as eternal truth was forgotten or corrupted among the children of men. 

There is no place for ignorance in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Light 
and truth, ever increasing, the only safe protection against evil, must ever 
guide this people and all the world, if humanity shall find peace and 
happiness. 

Thus has come the exceedingly high educational standing of Latter- 
day Saints — above that of any other group of like numbers in the world. 
We expect ever to seek after knowledge and to share in the great truth- 
advances of these latter days. 

However, knowledge alone contributes little to human welfare. Only 
when used for the good of man does it acquire real value. "The Glory 
of God is intelligence" ; but the intelligent man gathers knowledge and 
proceeds to use it in harmony with the divine plan of salvation — for 
the blessing of the children of men. True learning comes when knowledge 
is used. Correct use gives life to knowledge. In Mormon terminology, 
wisdom and intelligence are synonymous. Wisdom in the use of knowl- 
edge is as important as knowledge itself. 

Such beliefs have made the Latter-day Saints supporters of all 
sound educational endeavors. We look upon our public schools, from 
kindergarten to university, as the finest expression of democracy. They 
are levelers and equalizers of our citizenry. They offer the even chance 
in life for rich and poor, weak and strong. 

THE DUTY OF SCHOOLS 

Therefore, we have given our public schools a great trust ; and have 
endowed them with tremendous power. Our children are in their keeping 
during most of the formative years of life. As the schools teach so will 
the coming generation think and act. The conditions in our land today, 
good or bad, may well be laid at the doors of our schools, which nourished 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



63 



us in our immaturity with ideals which in our maturity are being trans- 
lated into action. 

In return for this trust we expect our schools to be preservers of 
the principles of human welfare ; bulwarks against every insidious, sub- 
versive foe of human freedom ; defenses against all invaders of human 
rights; teachers of the way from war to peace, from poverty to pros- 
perity. In times of moral, social or economic upheaval, our schools, 
ideal-builders, must be among the nation's most powerful defenses. We 
rely on our schools, for example, to prevent the unspeakable, blazing 
evil now raging in Europe from starting a conflagration in our land. 
We teach with easy precision protection against communicable diseases. 
It is more important to teach immunity against untruth; to show how 
the fruits of our civilization may be preserved and increased. Among 
the many instruments of democracy, the schools must stand foremost in 
preparing the people against coming evils, and for a better future day. 

We are in the midst of a changing day. It is folly to believe that we 
can go on happily with millions of men unemployed, and as many millions 
living under an inadequate standard of living. There will needs be much 
readjustment to secure prosperity for all. Many activities must be re- 
directed to make every able-bodied person self-supporting. In this re- 
alignment of forces, and reorganization of resources, the schools must 
take an active, practical part. 

To do this, to be worthy of their high commission in this troubled 
day, two major objectives must be courageously reemphasized and ac- 
complished by our schools. 

RELIGIOUS TRAINING MUST BE ENCOURAGED 

First, moral and religious education must be given hereafter an 
honorable and corresponding place by the side of the traditionally im- 
portant subjects of the curriculum. For the safety of the nation, moral 
teaching should be given, at definite hours, in every publicly supported 
classroom. There must be eager cooperation with every project, such 
as our L. D. S. Seminaries and Institutes, to supply religious instruction 
outside the school. There must be no whining and hiding behind a 
misinterpretation of the constitutional provision for religious liberty. We 
still say on our coins, "In God we trust." There must be no attempt 
to place the sole responsibility upon the Church. The strongest defense 
of this or any other nation is not of sword and shot, of long range cannon 
and bombs from the sky. It lies in the spiritual domain of life, among 
the intangibles. The human will, according to its training, determines 
whether steel shall be shaped into swords or plowshares. The "fifth 
column" and other corroding influences, and all evil, often disdainful of 
exploding bombs, are conquered and chained only by spiritual weapons. 
Thinking citizens, the country over, are recognizing the danger of a 
citizenry, untaught and untrained in the moral and spiritual principles 
upon which human welfare has ever rested. Unless our schools reso- 
lutely place such training foremost, they will have sown to the whirlwind. 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

IMPORTANCE OF PRACTICAL EDUCATION 

Second, the right of way, after moral and religious training, in 
every school and college curriculum, must be given to useful knowledge 
■ — knowledge that may be used in making a living, in meeting the actual 
and daily needs of life. Unless this is done our physical defenses will 
prove inadequate, and economic chaos will increase. We must dignify 
and ennoble the necessary tasks of life, to secure contentment among 
humanity. 

The activities of life center upon the business of making a living. 
Every man worthy of life desires to be able to sustain himself and a 
family of his own. This has always been an objective of the Latter-day 
Saints. In our welfare program the need of caring for the poor, necessary 
and beautiful as it is, is less important than the attempt to find ways and 
means to enable the poor to provide for themselves, and to raise the 
standard of living of all to meet their natural wants properly. Universal 
self-support will be a mighty defense against any enemy. A contented, 
self-supporting people will resist the cheap, enslaving offerings of evil. 

Practical education must be featured as never before. Men and 
women must be taught how to use the natural resources about them for 
their support in life. The economic possibilities must be set forth, of 
waters, soils, forests, mountains and hills. To solve the problems of 
the day, and of tomorrow, we need more trained farmers and mechanics, 
skilled craftsmen, business men and housewives who are so educated 
that they can do their work intelligently, and therefore with respect for 
their calling ; and who are ready to wrestle joyfully with the gifts of earth. 
For these are the only true producers of wealth. There would be more 
prosperity and home happiness if more men toiled with the hand as well 
as with the head, and if every girl were trained in the processes of main- 
taining and running a household successfully with emphasis on child 
care and training. Such education for boys and girls should begin in the 
lowest grades for some do not reach high school and many fail to enter 
college. 

Such education does not require special industrial or vocational 
schools. That would defeat the spirit of democracy, for every boy, rich 
or poor, should learn how to support a family, and every normal girl 
looks forward to the joys of wifehood and motherhood. Besides in a true 
democracy, class consciousness must be avoided. Such important training 
should not be neglected nor left to chance. Our present system of edu- 
cation should direct from year to year, from grade to grade, the thought 
and training of students toward the application of knowledge to useful 
ends — life-sustaining ends. The colleges should gladly receive students 
so trained, and continue the training under college environment. 

Culture accompanies such training. The discipline of the mind is 
the essence of culture. The so-called "common pursuits," have in later 
years been invested with a variety of newly discovered knowledge. They 
are in this respect not surpassed by the so-called "professions." The 
study of agriculture and home making may be made as cultural as of 
astronomy ; or of our own government as that of ancient Rome. Failing 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



65 



to recognize this, thousands of young people have failed to find their 
places in life. They find no jobs for they have not been trained to work, 
too often only to seek to avoid work. In the words of Brigham Young, 
"Education is the handmaid to honest labor." 

Moreover, they who have learned to work, and who have acquired 
their belongings through personal toil, are the safest members of society. 
They believe in private property; and what is more, they believe in 
allowing others to gather about them material benefits. They will be the 
last to attempt to dispossess others of property won through honest toil. 
Teaching men and women to work and to earn a living is the best 
insurance against the false economic doctrines which flood the land. 

OPPORTUNITIES LIE AHEAD 

One other thought remains. The pioneers who entered these valleys 
conquered the desert with such knowledge and strength as they possessed. 
Since that day, knowledge has increased immeasurably. By the inven- 
tion of machines, man's strength has increased a thousand fold. Re- 
sources of earth lie about us which were beyond the reach of the early 
pioneers, but which may now be developed with our new knowledge 
and added power. There are more opportunities for youth today than 
in the pioneer years. It is our own fault if this has not been taught by 
our institutions of learning. In the development of practical education 
the pointing out of such possibilities will be of major importance. 

MORAL AND SPIRITUAL TRAINING ARE FACTORS AGAINST EVIL 

If the schools shall be powerful factors in building defenses against 
evil, and in preparing against the enemy, they must face about from 
traditional views and give undivided attention on the one hand to moral 
and spiritual training, and on the other to practical education. Such 
teaching, for that matter, has been the counsel and advice of the Church 
from the beginning. Never was it needed more than now. 

We who have been entrusted with parenthood must anxiously plan 
for the welfare of our children and the coming generations. If changes 
are needed, let us make them. The schools are ours, and the responsibility 
for the coming race is ours. The time has come when schools must train 
our children for safe living, that is for greatest usefulness, which 
means greatest happiness. 

The vast majority of the teaching profession, looking into the future, 
agree in the main with the view which I have here expressed. They 
recognize that schools must reflect the wishes of the people, by whom 
they are supported ; and as good citizens, themselves, are ready to help 
our schools foster truth and destroy evil, thus making them main de- 
fenses of our nation. 

As a Church we have always tried to be in the forefront of pro- 
gressive changes. An uncertain future looms before us. As far as we 
have influence we should turn our educational endeavors towards a 
secure and happy future. If we do so, we shall help build a mighty 
defense against threatened disaster. 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

The outstanding characteristic or difference between the religion 
of the Latter-day Saints and that of the various churches in the world 
is the fact that God has endowed this work with power from on high. In 
other words, divine authority is the distinguishing feature between the 
Church of God and the churches of men, that have been established by a 
great many various sects of so-called Christianity. 

PLAN OF SALVATION OF DIVINE ORIGIN 

The principle of authority was made manifest in the very beginning 
of the promulgation of God's work, and that occurred in that primeval 
day, before the earth was created, when God had assembled together 
His sons and His daughters to hear the glad tidings of great joy. 

It is only a natural and obvious conclusion which everybody should 
concede that if there be a plan of life and salvation, that it must be one of 
divine origin, for only God can save His children. And we ought to re- 
cognize the fact that we are here in a state of mortality ; that death has 
come into the world as a result of disobedience in the Garden of Eden, 
under very peculiar circumstances ; and the purpose of this thing is that 
mankind might be given the privilege of choosing between good and evil, 
and undergoing a test or a trial, and for that purpose God created this 
earth and placed His children upon it, that we might receive that educa- 
tion and that knowledge and understanding, that education pertaining to 
our spiritual and temporal welfare, that we might be able to combat with 
the powers of evil. 

How could we ever be saved, how could we ever be exalted, unless we 
should have the benefit of this earth life experience, and be in attendance 
and ready to learn in God's great school which He has established for 
the education and benefit and blessing of His children ? It must be then 
conceded that the plan of life and salvation would be one that was de- 
vised by the Lord Himself, and cannot be of any human invention. That 
being the case, we must look to Him for that all- wise plan and for that 
perfect system by which we may be prepared to receive what God in- 
tends we shall receive. 

man's three estates 

There are three estates of man : The first estate was when we dwelt 
with God as His spirit children, in His holy habitation, before the world 
was made, as we read in our favorite hymn : 

O my Father, thou that dwellest 

In the high and glorious place, 
When shall I regain thy presence 

And again behold Thy face? 

In thy holy habitation 

Did my spirit once reside? 
In my first primeval childhood 

Was I nurtured near Thy side? 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



67 



That tells, in those beautiful lines of Eliza R. Snow, what occurred 
before the world was made, to which the Lord referred when He said 
unto His servant Job : 

Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, 
if thou hast uderstanding. * * * 

When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted 
for joy. 

That is a question that implies a great deal. It contemplates and in- 
fers that there was a time and a place where God had assembled His 
children together to hear a proclamation. What was the occasion? We 
are told there that it was a time of rejoicing, and the Lord had assembled 
His sons, and His daughters, too, I doubt not, to hear the glad tidings of 
great joy. It was the proclamation of God's plan for the salvation of His 
children, for the education and the improvement of the children of God. 
It involved the creation of this earth, and it involved the knowledge of 
good and evil, that we might be tried, and for this purpose was it created 
that we might in our second estate through obedience to His plan qualify 
ourselves for the third estate, namely: eternal life in the Kingdom of 
God. 

COVENANTS MADE BY THE LORD 

We read all through the scriptures, both in ancient and in modern 
scriptures, that the Lord has made a covenant with His people. He has 
always called those to whom He has given a dispensation of His prov- 
idence, "His covenant people". What was that covenant? We hear a 
great many talk about the new and everlasting covenant, even among our 
own people, and we sometimes jump at the conclusion that it refers ex- 
clusively to the marriage covenant. The marriage covenant is truly a 
very great and important part of that everlasting covenant, but it is only 
a part. 

The Lord made it known to the Prophet Joseph Smith, as you will 
find it recorded in Section 66, paragraph 2, of the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants, that the "new and everlasting covenant" is nothing more or less 
than the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its fulness, as it was reveal- 
ed and proclaimed in that primeval day when the great and noble ones, or 
the "morning stars," sang together and all the sons of God shouted for 
joy — the day the Lord made known to them the terms of His everlasting 
covenant, setting forth what He expects us to do, and also informing us 
what He will do if we comply. 

What is a covenant? Our standard dictionaries define a covenant 
as "an agreement entered into between two or more persons or parties." 
It is just such an agreement that the Lord promulgated and announced 
to His spirit children, that filled their hearts with joy and gladness, and 
whereupon the morning stars, the great and noble ones, sang together and 
all of the sons and daughters of God made the heavens ring with the 
shouts of joy and gladness over these glad tidings. 

It is that one and only way that the Lord has ever revealed, that one 
and only plan, that one and only Gospel that was promulgated in that

early day. It is that which has been given to the children of men as the 
power of God unto salvation. It was first given to our father Adam, af- 
ter his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. The Lord revealed that cove- 
nant to him, and explained precisely what it was and declared that it was 
the plan of salvation. It was continued with Enoch, and was also re-es- 
tablished with Noah and his sons after the deluge. 

It was again given to Abraham, and with him the promises of the 
everlasting covenant were made as frequently as stated in the Bible, and 
later it was established with Moses after the delivery of the children of 
Israel from their long bondage in the land of Egypt but under the "lesser 
law," the law of carnal commandments, the rebellious and stiff-necked 
Israelites not being prepared for the higher law, but were given the les- 
ser law as a school master to bring them to Christ ; and when our Lord 
came in the meridian of time, He again set up His Church and established 
the same everlasting covenant, but now under the higher law. 

In the light of these various dispensations, we can readily see the 
meaning of the words of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, which I 
now quote : 

O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them 
that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children to- 
gether, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not ! 
(Luke 13:34.) 

During each of these dispensations many generations have been 
brought into the fold by entering into the covenant through the holy 
waters of baptism and have gone to their reward, but let it be remember- 
ed that the Devil and his angels also came and led the children of men 
again into darkness and error and a general falling away from the Truth 
ensued, and always for the same reason as it was described by the Prophet 
Isaiah when he said, "because they have transgressed the laws, changed 
the ordinance and broken the everlasting covenant" and thus the earth 
has been defiled. (Isaiah 24:5). 

ABRAHAM SHOWN SOME OF THE LORD'S WORK 

I have just stated that it was with Abraham that the promises were 
made ; let me now add that it is from the writings of Abraham and those 
of Moses that we learn the particulars concerning the everlasting cove- 
nant as these writings are contained in the Pearl of Great Price, from 
which I now quote : 

Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was ; and among all these there were many 
of the noble and great ones : 

And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said : These I will make my rulers ; for he stood 
among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he 
said unto me, Abraham, thou art one of them ; thou wast chosen before thou 
wast born. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said 
unto those who were with him : We will go down, for there is space there, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon 
these may dwell ; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. 

That is our part in the covenant, to do all things whatsoever the Lord 
our God shall command us. All things that the Lord our God shall com- 
mand us are embodied in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its ful- 
ness, for the Lord has said that "man lives not by bread alone, but by 
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God". 

Then comes the Lord's part : 

And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon. 

Very significant language. What does that mean? It means simply 
this, that there shall be added to our immortal spirits these bodies of flesh 
and bones. 

And they who keep their second estate — [that is, our present estate 
here after we have received these bodies of flesh and bones] — They who 
keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and 
ever. (Pearl of Great Price. Abraham 3:22-26) 

What a glorious promise ! A never-ending glory that is to be added 
upon the heads of those who keep their second estate, by doing what the 
Lord commands them, obeying His glorious Gospel. That is the only plan. 
It is God's plan, and has been given to the inhabitants of the earth in the 
various dispensations of His providence. 

THE COVENANT RE-ESTABLISHED BY THE SAVIOR 

When the Lord our Savior came and dwelt upon the earth, the 
everlasting covenant was re-established among the children of men, un- 
der the higher law. Previous to the coming of Christ the lesser law osten- 
sibly, but very imperfectly, was being administered by the various sects 
of that day. The children of Israel, fresh from their bondage in the land 
of Egypt, where they had imbibed much of the idolatry of that nation, 
were not prepared for the higher law, and the Lord gave unto them the 
lesser law as a schoolmaster to bring them unto Christ. 

But when the Savior came and ministered among men He estab- 
lished His Church and Kingdom anew, under the higher law. In the 
former dispensation it was the law of carnal commandments, they not 
being prepared for that higher law. Moses was complaining to the Lord 
that he was slow of speech and felt himself incompetent to lead the peo- 
ple, and he asked the Lord that He would give him someone in his stead. 
The Lord was not pleased altogether with his request, but finally it was 
granted, and He said unto Moses : "Take thy brother Aaron and his sons 
to act in the office of the priest." Then He conferred upon Aaron a part 
of the glory that was upon Moses — not all. The glory which was upon 
Moses was the glory of the Melchizedek Priesthood. The part that was 
given to Aaron is known to us as the Aaronic Priesthood. That was the 
beginning of this order of the Priesthood, and yet it is to endure forever. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Dag 



The Aaronic Priesthood continued to minister in the affairs of the 
Church and the Lord took Moses out of their midst and with him the 
holy Melchizedek Priesthood, but the Aaronic Priesthood remained in 
the Church until the coming of John the Baptist. (Doc. & Cov. 84:25 
and 26). 



From what I have said and from the inspired writings of the proph- 
ets, which I have copiously quoted, it will be obvious that there have been 
many dispensations of God's providence in every one of which prophets 
have been raised up duly commissioned of God to act in His name, foi\ 
as the Prophet Amos has declared it : "Surely the Lord God will do' 
nothing but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets :" 
(Amos 3 :7). 

It will also be apparent that the everlasting covenant, or in other 
words "the Gospel of Jesus Christ" has been the very essence of God's 
dealings with mankind, even from the days of Adam until now — yes, 
and even antedating the creation of this earth to that primeval day "when 
the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for 



It will also be noted that after each and every one of the various 
dispensations there has been a falling away and darkness has covered the 
earth and gross darkness the minds of the people, as prophesied by Isaiah 
the prophet. (Isaiah 60:2). 

Even the glorious Messianic dispensation when Jesus ministered 
among men and set in His Church firstly Apostles and secondly prophets, 
etc., for the work of the ministry, that we be not tossed to and fro by 
every wind of doctrine, was no exception to the rule for it, too, was 
soon followed by a universal apostasy ; and, indeed, heresies were creep- 
ing into the Church while the Apostles were still living, (see I Cor. 
11:18, 19) but after the Apostles "fell alseep" and the prophetic spirit 
disappeared, they fell into the deepest gloom of darkness and superstition 
and paganistic ceremonials and mysticisms which were entirely foreign to 
the simple ordinances of the Gospel as they were taught and practiced in 
the primitive Church by the Savior and His Apostles. For a full dis- 
cussion of this subject let me refer you to the series of radio addresses 
delivered by the late President B. H. Roberts over Radio Station KSL, 
which has been published in book form under the title of "The Falling 
Away". 



Now, however, came the promise of another dispensation, even 
"The Dispensation of the Fulness of Times". This dispensation has al- 
ready been ushered in through the visitation of heavenly beings and 
the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, by whom the Lord 
has again set up His Church and Kingdom and established His everlast- 
ing covenant restoring the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its 
primitive purity. This is the Church and Kingdom which the Lord has

set up never again to be thrown down nor given to another people, but it 
shall stand forever, as foretold by the Prophet Daniel. (See Daniel II). 

And now again as on all previous occasions, He has endowed His 
Church with power from on high, the all important and outstanding 
feature which has always distinguished His Church from the man-made 
churches of the world. 

May we ever have an abiding testimony of the Truth and may our 
faith ever manifest itself in the works of obedience. May we hearken to 
the counsels of our leaders, upholding and sustaining them in their high 
office, for they are God's servants zealously laboring in building up His 
Church and Kingdom upon the earth, I pray in the name of our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

We have a number of released Mission presidents. We hope to 
hear from as many of them as possible. In order, however, that we may 
hear as many as possible, we shall ask them to be good enough to con- 
fine themselves to five minutes time. Anything under five minutes is 
five minutes. Five minutes is not six or seven or ten. 

Our first speaker will be President Joseph Jacobs, of the Palestine- 
Syrian Mission. 

ELDER JOSEPH JACOBS 

Former President of the Palestine-Syrian Mission 

My dear brothers and sisters, I bring you greetings from the Saints 
in the Palestine-Syrian Mission. It was my privilege and blessing to be 
called to preside over that historic and interesting Mission in 1937. 
Although in numbers the Saints in that Mission are relatively few, yet 
in faith and works they are a great people. While there and since re- 
turning home, their reports show that over ninety per cent of those who 
should pay tithing, do so. In the payment of Fast offerings, in the at- 
tendance of their meetings, and other Church activities they compare 
favorably with the highest group in the Church. 

About three weeks ago I received a report from that Mission 
field about the condition of the Saints. The report states that they are 
all firm in the faith, are continuing their meetings, tithing is being paid 
regularly, and an entire family has applied for baptism. 

Incidentally, the report was mailed the latter part of May but just 
arrived here. 

Being literally located at the cross-roads of the world, from time 
immemorial wars have been numerous in that part of the world. And 
because of its geographical position it is dangerous to remain in that 
land whenever war breaks out in any of the nearby nations. Because of 
these conditions, that Mission has been closed four times since it opened 
in 1890. Intervals of closing range from two to thirteen years. But 
every time the Mission opened, the new Mission president has been 
able to find many of the Saints and has discovered to his surprise that 
they were still in the faith and carrying on. 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Dag 

I rejoice in the privilege and opportunity that has come to me to 
proclaim the Gospel in that land — in the land where the Savior of the 
world did His missionary work while He was on the earth. Over twenty- 
five years ago a Patriarch promised me that it would be my privilege and 
blessing to preach the Gospel to them that are of the House of Judah. 
That promise has been fulfilled. 

The Lord was with us in our labors. He blessed us so that our 
way was always open. None in Our family nor any of our missionaries 
was seriously ill. We were not persecuted as the former missionaries 
were in the past in that land. Our efforts were blessed with some bap- 
tisms and many friends. 

That you may appreciate our difficulties I shall just mention one 
item. We used five different and distinct languages in our mission field, 
each with its own alphabet, grammar and syntax. 

Once I was giving an illustrated lecture to a group of professors 
from the University of Beirut. When I showed the Pioneer Trails 
film and praised the achievements of the pioneers and how they made the 
desert blossom as the rose, it sounded to them like I was over-rating 
the accomplishments of the pioneers and the beauties of Utah. At the 
end of the lecture one doctor stood up and asked to say a few words. 
He said he wanted to substantiate what I said. "Not only that, but," 
said he. "Rev. Jacobs did not state half of the beauty of Utah. I have 
been in Utah. Every city and village I passed through was clean and 
well arranged. I went through the Tabernacle grounds and want to 
witness to you that every word that Rev. Jacobs said is true and more so." 

One day I was explaining our beliefs to a minister. I read to him 
our first Article of Faith. When I got through reading it, he said, 
"Well that is nothing new — I believe in all of that. Why" he said, "I 
have made a special study of God, / know all about Him. In fact I 
wrote my thesis on God when I obtained my degree from college." 
When I mentioned that our God is a personal God, as we believe the 
Bible teaches, we disagreed. "We do not need a God in this day and 
age," he said, "we are too civilized to believe in such fancies." How 
thankful I was that God had blessed us in our day with a living prophet 
to reveal eternal truths ! 

I want to thank my Heavenly Father for the privilege of living 
in this land of promise — in this land which is choice above all other 
lands — in this land of Zion. And above all I want to thank Him for 
my membership in this Church. 

May our Heavenly Father bless the leaders of this nation that we 
may be kept in the paths of peace. May he bless our Prophet and Presi- 
dent and his associates that they may lead, guide, and direct this Church 
to its glorious destiny. And above all. may He bless us all with the 
spirit of humility and obedience so that we may follow our leaders and so 
live as to be worthy of all the blessings He has seen fit to grant us and 
may yet bestow upon us, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 
To the minute ! 

Obedient to my usual custom, I want to thank this choir for the 
splendid music which it has rendered. 

Remember, please, brethren and sisters, to drive carefully. Let us 
have no accident if it be in any way possible to avoid it. One police 
officer has sent word asking that I be good enough to add to my slogan, 
and I use his words : "Please ask the pedestrians to show a little sense." 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel". 
Elder Alonzo J. Gilbert, President of the Idaho Stake offered the 
closing prayer. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the great Conference convened Saturday af- 
ternoon, October 5, at 2 p. m. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We are again blessed with the presence of President Grant at this 
service, and we are grateful to our Heavenly Father for this blessing. 
President Grant has asked me to conduct the services. 

The music this afternoon will be furnished by members of the 
Tabernacle Choir. Not all of the members can attend, owing to their 
being employed in places from which they cannot be excused, but those 
who can attend are here. While we sang very well this morning, I sup- 
pose we will have to admit that they can sing better than we did. 

The choir is under the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall. Elder 
Alexander Schreiner is at the organ. 

The choir and the congregation sang the hymn : "O Ye Mountains 
High," by Charles W. Penrose. 

The opening prayer was offered by President Joseph R. Chris- 
tiansen, of Moroni Stake. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang "Holy Spirit, Truth Divine," by Handel. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My Brethren and Sisters : We Latter-day Saints are certainly a 
peculiar people, due in part to our characteristic religious beliefs and 
claims. Yet we are a very practical people, combining religious faith 
and the affairs of daily life into what we may call a "way of life." It is 
to some phases of this "way of life" that I wish to call your attention. 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Dap 

We gladly accept the view of the Psalmist, declared in these words : 
"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that 
thou visitest him ? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, 
and hast crowned him with glory and honour." (Psalms 8:4, 5) 

OBSERVANCE OF LAWS OF CHURCH WINS RESPECT 

A few weeks ago I heard President Clark tell a factual story of 
the failure of a fine upstanding young man to be employed by a large 
financial organization. The young man possessed ability, a fine person- 
ality, a good education and excellent initiative. He had been a valiant 
worker in the Church. The opening with the organization was intended 
to lead to an important executive position. Our brother failed of 
employment because he was found to be smoking. 

His prospective employer knew the Church teaches the Word of 
Wisdom, and further, that the young man in question had formerly both 
taught and practiced the Word of Wisdom. So why did he take up 
smoking ? President Clark did not say. But was it not because he lacked 
moral courage and foolishly thought smoking would help him to succeed 
in the business world? 

President Clark's statement reminded me of a conversation I had 
28 years ago with our late lamented Simon Bamberger, former governor 
and long a prominent business man of Utah and a non-Mormon. At 
the time of our chat Mr. Bamberger said he personally interviewed 
the applicants for important jobs with his companies. "If a Mormon 
applied we preferred that he be a returned missionary," he said, "but 
never employed him if he admitted that he even occasionally drank 
coffee or liquor, or smoked a cigarette." To my question "why" Mr. 
Bamberger answered, "I know these young men taught your Word 
of Wisdom while missionaries. On coming home if they fail to live 
the Word of Wisdom, I believe the answer is one of two things — they 
are either weaklings or hypocrites. The Bamberger Company wants 
neither weaklings nor hypocrites in its employ." Neither did the great 
organization of which President Clark spoke want a weakling or a 
hypocrite in its employ. 

All the world who have heard of the teachings of Mormonism 
know that the Church stands for total abstinence from the use of narcotic 
drinks and drugs, including tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco. But there 
are some members of the Church who admit they took to the use of one 
or more of these forbidden things in the belief that it would help them 
socially, professionally or in business. Was and is this a mistaken belief ? 
Certainly very many desirable opportunities have been lost by our people, 
as indicated by the examples just mentioned, because they lacked the moral 
courage or the good judgment to say "no" when they were tempted. 

A little study of the matter will convince us that the weak always 
admire the strong, the unclean delights to see the clean, the foolish envy 
the wise. In this drifting, sinful world a clean, high type, beautiful charac- 
ter is beloved by the multitude even though the vast majority of them do 
not attain to his high moral plane of living. No member of the Church, 



ELDER JOSEPH P. MERRILL 



75 



young or old, male or female, will ever handicap himself or herself 
in the association with decent people by maintaining the high moral 
standards of living advocated by the Church. On the contrary, smoking 
and drinking by reputedly good Mormons will always hurt them, never 
help them, in gaining respect from worth-while non-members. They 
may succeed, but it will be in spite of their lapses rather than because of 
them. 

CHARACTERISTIC DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH 

But let us go further and be reminded that "unto whom much is 
given much is required." The Latter-day Saints make many more 
religious professions than do ordinary Christians. We have many char- 
acteristic doctrines, among which are those relating to the personality 
of the members of the Godhead, of the divine calling of Joseph Smith, 
of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon, of the universality 
of the resurrection of the dead, of salvation for the dead, of the eternity 
of temple marriages, of personal pre-existence in the spirit world, and 
several others. The God whom we worship is a real personal being having 
the very form in which we ourselves are made, a God who hears and 
answers acceptable prayers and gives revelations to those worthy of and 
entitled to them; a God who said "this is my work and my glory — to 
bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Pearl of Great 
Price, Moses 1:39) 

Another characteristic and basic doctrine of Mormonism is that of 
eternal progression. We are spirit children of our Father in heaven and 
were conscious, intelligent, spirit-body personalities in the forms we 
now possess at the time of the great rebellion in heaven when Lucifer, 
the Son of the Morning, fought with the Father's loyal hosts, among 
whom we were numbered, in order to establish force as the dominant 
factor in man's salvation. Lucifer (Satan) and his rebels were overcome 
and cast out, coming down to earth where they have been ever since. 

satan's influence in the world 

These things are well-taught among us so that we understand them 
in outline, at least. My purpose now in reminding you of them is to call 
your attention to the fact that Satan, a spirit brother of ours, is a real 
existent personal being with a spirit body and is here among us with a 
multitude of helpers. He is infinitely more than a mere idea, a thought, 
or figment of the imagination. Now a thing sad to see is that Satan has 
enormous influence and power among men which he exercises to their 
hurt, sorrow and death. What makes this particularly sad to see is 
that it is wholly unnecessary for men to yield to Satan's power. God 
has given each one of us the strength, with His help, to put Satan behind 
us. In yielding to him men do not live up to their high privileges. They 
seem not to remember who they are — sons of a royal Father, the supreme 
commander of the universe, a Father who loves them so much that He 
gave Jesus Christ, His greatly beloved, first-born and only begotten 
Son in the flesh, to die a tortuous, ignominious death that they might 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

^'Saturday, October 5 Second Dag 

have the opportunity of being redeemed and live again forever in His 
glorious presence. Yes, brethren and sisters, God has given us the 
power and Clearly indicated the way to overcome Satan. 

FREE AGENCY A BLESSING FROM GOD 

But let us ever remember, in this connection, one thing more — God 
has given us our free agency. In this connection it is also well to remem- 
ber the truth expressed by a beautiful hymn in these words : 

Know this, that every soul is free 
To choose his life and what he'll be ; 
For this eternal truth is given, 
That God will force no man to heaven. 

He'll call, persuade, direct aright, 
And bless with wisdom, love and light ; 
In nameless ways be good and kind ; 
But never force the human mind. 

Freedom and reason make us men ; 

Take these away what are we then ? 
People often complain that God is either non-existent or merciless 
and devoid of love, otherwise He would not permit such a monstrous 
and inhuman tragedy as is today being enacted in Europe and elsewhere. 
But no one who understands the Father's doctrine of free agency can 
ever give any sympathy or support to such complaints. But time does 
not permit me to give further attention now to this point. 

ATTRIBUTES OF GOD INHERITED BY HIS CHILDREN 

I wish to give emphasis to the fact that since we are spirit children 
of our Father in heaven it is perfectly natural that we should possess 
at least in embryo and microscopic quantities the attributes of our Father. 
And looking at these attributes as they are developed in our finest char- 
acters — as they were beautifully exhibited in the earthly life of Jesus, 
for example, we may get concrete ideas about the nature of God who 
possesses these attributes in perfection. 

One of these is intelligence. Indeed, intelligence is His glory. 
Intelligence governed by wisdom is also the glory of man, the attribute 
that chiefly sets him apart from the mere animal. Possessing this attribute 
it is easy to understand why it is right for him to be given his free agency. 
We are therefore entirely in accord with the doctrine expressed in the 
Declaration of Independence at the birth of our nation — that man is 
endowed by his Creator with the inalienable right to life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness. 

RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN ACTS 

But free agency entails upon man a weighty obligation — that of 
being responsible for his conduct. And particularly is this the case in 
full measure in our land of liberty. As residents of America and as 
members of the Church, privileged as we are with an understanding 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



77 



more or less complete of who we are, of our relations to one another, to 
our fellow-men, to our country and to our God, we have indeed been 
given much — are more highly favored than nearly all other men. But 
we say this humbly and thankfully, not boastfully. We say it also in 
full realization of the fact that because the Lord has given us much 
He will in justice exact much at our hands. He will hold us accountable 
for all that we do. 

And here let me particularize a little, indicating a few of our obliga- 
tions. The Lord requires us to develop the attributes with which we 
were born. We cannot be saved in ignorance. The law of growth is 
activity. No one is exempt from this law. But to grow properly 
the activity must be suited to the growth desired. Playing foot-ball may 
develop an athlete but it will not make a musician. An intellect governed 
by wisdom is man's proudest possession. Conduct actuated by the golden 
rule yields him the greatest happiness. Responsibilities fully met con- 
tribute most rapidly to God-like growth. 

But in all of these things let us remember that Satan is ever near 
to handicap us if he can. It is easier to drift than to row. So Satan 
always prompts us to drift. To grow strong in body, mind or spirit, 
one or all, self-discipline is absolutely essential. But if we please our 
Maker we must grow ; therefore we must discipline ourselves, that is, 
we must bring our conduct into harmony with the inexorable laws of 
divinity that govern growth. I have already indicated a rule of conduct 
that is in complete harmony with the great law of moral growth — the 
golden rule. 

Now to particularize still more. We Latter-day Saints profess so 
much that logic, reason, and consistency require us to demonstrate our 
honesty and sincerity by living according to our teachings, e. g., observe 
the Word of Wisdom. But this is not all. The Lord requires us thus 
to live in order to win His favor. And He cannot be deceived. He knows 
our hearts and our thoughts. 

Are we reasonable and wise in what we do ? To know what is best 
to say, what is best to do and to know how best to do it is to possess 
inspired wisdom, probably our greatest gift. If we live worthy of divine 
guidance, as we are privileged to do, we shall not go very far astray. 
We spend great sums and send thousands of missionaries forth to preach 
the Gospel. Do we so live that our lives are sermons in harmony with 
the teachings of our missionaries? If not, why not? If not, we shall cer- 
tainly be condemned. Let us not forget it. 

We live in this land choice above all other lands. Are we worthy 
to enjoy its incomparable blessings? Do we discipline ourselves, self- 
imposing upon us whatever struggles and sacrifices may be necessary 
in order that we shall preserve inviolate the principles bequeathed to 
us by the fathers of our country, many of whom spilled their blood 
and gave their lives that their descendants might be free? 

INTELLIGENT VOTING COMMENDED 

Brethren and sisters, the obligations of American citizenship are 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

numerous and sometimes heavy. But to a genuine Latter-day Saint, 
diligently trying to keep the commandments of God, it is a real pleasure 
to bear these responsibilities. May I remind you that among the greatest 
of them is the duty of wise voting. Perhaps few, if any, of us fully meet 
this responsibility. To do so we must keep ourselves informed of the 
necessary pertinent facts relative to candidates, remain free from the 
influence of prejudice and all deceptive propaganda, give no support of 
any kind to demagogues and their deceptive promises, but be willing 
to labor and to sacrifice as much as necessary that our government and 
our country shall be kept free from the hands of those who would 
despoil them. , 

To refresh your memories of the attitude of the Church in these 
matters please re-read Section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants 
on "A Declaration of Belief Regarding Governments and Laws," adopted 
by a unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church held at Kirtland, 
Ohio, August 17, 1835. 

The following taken from the Declaration is a key sentence : "We 
believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are 
framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free 
exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protec- 
tion of life." The Church cannot look with any degree of favor upon 
any proposition whatsoever that would oppose to the slightest extent 
this statement. 

Brethren and sisters, our free America, the America of our fathers, 
is gravely in danger, not from enemies without but from enemies within. 
It is the duty of all Latter-day Saints, living under the stars and stripes, 
as well as of all loyal citizens, to forget their petty differences and their 
ignoble personal selfishness, and rally to her support. This may best 
be done by holding inviolate the Charter of our liberties — the Con- 
stitution of the United States and all good laws made in harmony there- 
with. This certainly requires that we shall be careful and elect to make 
and administer the laws only people who are wise, patriotic and morally 
worthy — only men 'and women of high character. 

God bless America, God bless His faithful children, and give 
them the strength, moral courage and wisdom, through their desire and 
worthiness, to keep His commandments I humbly pray in Christ's name. 
Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy and President of the New England 

Mission 

I am happy to come from Boston to attend this Conference, and 
to report to the parents of the missionaries laboring in New England that 
they are a noble band of young men and women, and we are proud 
of them. They work very hard and it does not take long for them 
to prove themselves true servants of God.

LABORS OF MISSIONARIES PRAISED 

New England is a difficult mission because we have so few members 
of the Church, but what we have are as true and noble as ever lived. If 
we have a branch of six or eight or ten members that have been converted 
in New England, we call it a large branch, and your sons and daughters 
go into these districts and sometimes far out on the borders of Canada, 
for we have Saints in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It is a fine 
people that we labor among. Boston is said to be the hub of America 
and the center of culture, and there are some twenty universities and 
colleges in Boston alone. So you see we are among a people who have 
always believed in education. You would be happy to see your boys and 
girls laboring, and could you be in the city of Lynn, a manufacturing 
center, at a Sunday morning meeting, you would find ten or fifteen 
young girls and boys, from the Methodist Church, singing in our choir 
there, and our Elders sitting in the Methodist Church of a Sunday 
evening taking part in their choir. 

A TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW ENGLAND 

You would like New England people. Many of them are des- 
cendants of the old Puritan stock; that stock that was represented in 
England by such men as Oliver Cromwell and John Milton. They came 
to America to build new homes and to be free to worship God as they 
wanted to worship. We speak unkindly sometimes of those people because 
they were very strict in their habits. They were Calvinistic and though 
they had their faults, they had their strong characteristics. They would 
not tolerate immorality. They would not tolerate impurity in politics. 
Said John Milton on one occasion: "Politics is the science of govern- 
ment and no politics can be pure until there is brought to bear on this 
great science the ideals that God governs in the affairs of men.." We 
do misunderstand them, it is true, but they were strict in their home 
life. I wish that today in the world we had more of the iron men like 
Cromwell, Admiral Coligny, and Governor Bradford of Plymouth 
Colony. 

AMERICAN IDEALS CORRUPTED 

One of the great wrongs going on in America to-day is the idea 
held by millions of people that they have the right to enjoy the things 
of life which they have never earned. It is a form of dishonesty that 
is corrupting the youth of to-day, it has already corrupted millions. It 
has produced an aversion to hard work. Idleness and the love of pleasure 
have taken away many of our American ideals given to us by the 
fathers of this nation. The hate of man for man has grown in this 
country as it has grown in the lands across the seas. These forces have 
torn down religious ideals, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord finds 
little lodgment in the hearts of men. Our civilization is suffering from 
a breakdown in character because our teachings have not had a sufficient 
effect on the actions and lives of individuals. We speak of reforms, 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

Human nature can only be reformed by a strengthening of prophetic 
religion. A new day for social betterment can come only through the 
revelations of God to his people — the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ. Ben- 
jamin Franklin warned us in the Constitutional convention at the very 
birth of this nation that our government will end in despotism if the 
people become corrupt. This nation must turn back to God. 

HONOR DONE TO C. E. DALLIN 

I should like to tell you about a lovely thing that happened in Boston 
two weeks ago to-morrow. It concerns the unveiling of the "Paul 
Revere monument," created for the city of Boston by our well known 
sculptor, Cyrus E. Dallin. The monument was inspired by the poem of 
Longfellow's which runs: "Listen, my children and you shall hear of 
the mid-night ride of Paul Revere." In 1884 Dallin entered his model 
in competition with ten other sculptors, the country's foremost. He won 
over men like Andrew O'Conner and Daniel Chester French. Dallin 
was told by the committee to execute his statue and it would stand in 
Copley Square. Then a sculptor named Trueman H. Bartlett wrote to 
the Boston Transcript : "It is the most outrageous piece of effrontery 
and lack of intelligence on the committee's part to have selected that 
model — a model of an impossible man on an impossible horse — ." These 
words had their effect, and the appropriation promised was never made. 
Dallin sought at intervals for fifty-five years to induce various mayors to 
appropriate funds for the statue, and a few years ago, he appealed to 
the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts, also without success. 
Several months ago, he presented his case to the five trustees of the George 
Robert White fund, who have the income of some $6,000,000 at their 
disposal for the erection of works of art. An appropriation was made for 
the statue and Dallin came into his own. The wrong done over half a 
century ago to a struggling art student of 23 was righted. There are 
compensations in life for long waiting when ideals are at stake. 

The statue stands in the north end of Boston near Paul Revere's 
old home and on the mall near the old North Church, from the tower of 
which hung the lanterns on the night of the nineteenth of April, 1775. 

I was present at the unveiling of the monument and heard Mayor 
Tobin of Boston say : "This day, I have the honor in behalf of the city 
of Boston to right a wrong that was done over a half a century ago. ... I 
have the honor of introducing to you Mr. Cyrus E. Dallin, the sculptor 
of this beautiful statue." Mr Dallin arose, bowed to the crowd and sat 
down again. He had won at last and his noble heart was filled with 
gladness. 

Dallin's "Massasoit" the Indian who made peace with the Pilgrim 
Fathers, stands overlooking the sea at Plymouth Rock, and his "Appeal to 
the Great Spirit" stands in front of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
What, pride we all have in the beautiful Angel on the cap-stone of our 
Temple here, which was also made by Dallin. It is possibly his master- 
piece. Dallin's story of how he came to make the statue at the request 
of President Wilford Woodruff is one of the loveliest things I ever heard.

AN APPEAL FOR LOYALTY TO THE CONSTITUTION 

That Sabbath day after the dedicatory exercises of the monument 
of Paul Revere, an old priest stood before hundreds of Italians in the 
old church near by and spoke on the "God-given Constitution of the 
United States." It did my heart good to see those alien people pay 
deference to our flag and to Paul Revere. Herein is a lesson. You Ital- 
ians, you Germans, and French, you Scandinavians and all other foreig- 
ners who have joined the Church and come to America have found 
freedom and liberty as you have never known before, and you may 
rest assured that this is a country blessed of God, and its Constitution 
was written by men who were God-inspired. Be true to your country 
and its Constitution which is for all time, for never can anything better 
take its place. The ideal of America was stated by President Grover 
Cleveland in ! Philadelphia at the centennial exercises in honor of the 
drafting of the Constitution in 1887. Said President Cleveland : "When 
we look down one hundred years and see the origin of our Constitution, 
when we contemplate all its trials and triumphs, when we realize how 
completely the principles upon which it is based have met every national 
need and every national peril, how devoutly should we say with Franklin, 
'God governs in the affairs of men,' and how solemn should be the thought 
that to us is delivered this ark of the people's covenant and to us sealed 
with the test of a century. It has been found sufficient in the past, and it 
will be found sufficient in all the years to come, if American people are 
true to their sacred trust. Another centennial day will come, and millions 
yet unborn will inquire concerning our stewardship and the safety of the 
Constitution. God grant they may find it unimpaired ; and as we rejoice 
to-day in the patriotism and devotion of those who lived one hundred 
years ago, so may those who follow us rejoice in our fidelity and love for 
Constitutional liberty." 

FAITH OVERCOMES FEAR 

My brethren and sisters, let us grow in faith ; that faith which will 
regenerate our lives completely. If we have the enlarged faith in the 
living God that was taught us by the Master, nothing can hurt us. Do 
you recall the story of the three men who were thrown into the fiery 
furnace because they would not bow down to the golden image erected 
by Nebuchadnezzar and give up their knowledge of the Living God? 
The Jews were in the furnace of affliction, but they were not afraid. 
When the three men — Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stood before 
the priests of Babylon, they answered : "If it be so, our God whom we 
serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; but if it be not 
according to His plan, be it still known unto thee, O king, that we will 
not worship thy gods nor the golden image. 

"And the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of 
their head singed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them, for there 
was with them in the furnace a fourth whose aspect was like unto the 
Son of God." 

What a lesson for the martyrs of the day in which we live ! 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

I pray for the blessings of God upon us all, that we may be unto 
all people a light and life and a help in this darkened world, I ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

BISHOP LEGRAND RICHARDS 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

As has been expressed during the meetings of this Conference, this 
is a great Church, a great people, and great have been our accomplish- 
ments. I was impressed as my father, Elder George F. Richards, opened 
the meeting this morning by his enumeration of some of the great things 
the Church has achieved up until the present time. I believe that we are 
only in the process of preparation for far greater achievements and 
accomplishments, for the Lord expects it at our hands. This is His Church 
and it is His Kingdom. Its destiny has been decreed and proclaimed by the 
prophets of old, and ultimately it is the Kingdom that shall fill the 
earth. With that thought in mind we should seek to prepare ourselves 
for every event of the Lord's providence concerning us and be prepared 
to carry on His Kingdom. 

THE PRIESTHOOD AS A MEANS OF BRINGING PEACE 

Brother Clark expressed in his opening remarks not a great fear 
that we should be attacked by any foreign foe, and I have felt that way 
in my own heart f or some time. But in analyzing the prophecies of the 
scriptures it seems to me that we are in some danger lest there should be 
people arise against people, and this in our land, as well as nation against 
nation, and I have always felt that if we could live nearer to one another, 
love one another as the Lord intended we should do that this brother- 
hood that is being built up through the Priesthood that we bear would 
be the thing that would preserve us against bloodshed. In the revelations 
in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that the day will come when 
every man who is not willing to take up his sword and fight against his 
neighbor should flee to Zion for safety, but if we keep close to the spirit 
of this great Priesthood that we bear, this brotherhood, we should be able 
to live at peace with one another and not have to take up the sword 
against our neighbors. 

TOLERANCE IN POLITICS COMMENDED 

With the wonderful achievements of the Church I feel there are 
some weaknesses that we should have pointed out. You will remember 
that Paul, in indicating the purpose of the organization of the Church, 
said that among other things it was for the perfecting of the Saints. 
Ever since I was a young man there has been one thing that has not 
been pleasing to me. It seems to me that it is a disturbing influence and 
probably the most disturbing of all influences in the midst of the Latter- 
day Saints, and that is this political discord. I know I am stepping in where 
angels fear to tread, but since I am not a politician I think I might be 
privileged to say a word or two on this subject. Notwithstanding the 



BISHOP LeGRAND RICHARDS 



83 



loyalty we bear to the Church, and all the service we render, somehow our 
minds become darkened when we talk of political things, and those who 
otherwise should be the best of friends and the best of neighbors become 
at variance with each other. I have heard President Grant tell in years 
gone by of some of the brethren who went Ward Teaching together and 
before they separated they were fist-fighting because they got into argu- 
ments over politics. I was with a group of brethren one day, when the dis- 
cussion became so hot that one brother said, "If the Savior should come 
back to the earth and He was a member of the other party I would oppose 
Him." I could understand this statement, but I did not believe the brother 
meant it. He saw me walk away in disgust so he hunted me up the next 
day and apologized for what he had said. 

This extreme attitude has always annoyed me. My family has 
sometimes said, "How is it that you do not take a more active part in 
politics ?" And I have said, "Because I love my friends too much, and 
I have seen too many men lose their friends because of their activity 
in politics." I do not see, brethren, why we cannot stand for correct 
principles and not have to. "haul through the mire," so to speak, each 
other just because we go out after a political position. I sometimes won- 
der if our brethren realize how much they do to destroy the faith of the 
youth of the Church and cause unfavorable criticism and comment by 
those who are not of the Church when they assail each other as has been 
the practice for all the years since I have been old enough to remember. 
We ought to feel that we owe our allegiance to the Church and to the 
Priesthood and to our brethren. We should love our brethren until the 
love that binds us together will be stronger than the cords of death, and 
this ought to cause us to sustain and uphold each other under all circum- 
stances and not permit the evil one to get an inroad into our midst be- 
cause of these disturbing influences. 

SAFETY IN FOLLOWING ADVICE OF CHURCH LEADERS 

Another word about politics, if you will permit it. We have had 
testimonies today from some of the brethren. I was particularly im- 
pressed with what Brother Evans said, that he believed in following the 
Prophet of the Lord even though he did not think he was right, because' 
he found he always was right, and he said those of us who are not willing 
to follow him when we do not think he is right do not believe that he is 
a Prophet of God. This accords with my feelings along this line. I have 
had the privilege for the past two and a half years, with my counselors, 
of meeting weekly with the First Presidency of this Church, and I want 
to testify to you here today, my brethren and sisters, that they are in 
very deed prophets of God, and I am willing to follow them when their 
judgment is different from mine because to me they are more than ordi- 
nary men ; they are men clothed upon by the power of God. When we 
raise our hands to sustain them as prophets, seers, and revelators, we 
ought to think twice before we criticize their judgment and their recom- 
mendations. 

A report came to the office the other day from one of our brethren 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

who said, "Well, if the President expresses his opinion on these political 
matters, the people will do just the opposite to what he says." We would 
not like to believe that this is true among the Latter-day Saints, but if 
there are any of us who feel that it is true, we ought to search our own 
hearts and see if that is the kind of faith we have in the leaders of this 
great Church. There are those all over the world including religious 
leaders today who are looking with despair upon the present conditions 
of the world and they are wondering how we are going to find the way 
out. While I was in the South, I read in one of the largest newspapers in 
Atlanta a long article written by Bishop Candler of the Methodist 
Church of Atlanta, a man who is respected all over this nation, and one 
of the great leaders of his people. After decrying the conditions, the lack 
of faith and the lack of leadership in the world, he closed his article with 
these words, 'We need the reappearance of prophets sent of God." When 
even religious leaders feel the need of prophets sent of God why shouldn't 
we feel the need of following the prophets who are in our midst who 
are sent of God ? Shortly after that, in the city of Atlanta, in November 
1936, Bishop Ainsworth addressed a conference of Methodists relative 
to alarming conditions observed today and urged the people of all faiths 
to engage in a crusade to save civilization from moral decadence. And 
then the Bishop added : "Never in the nation's history was the arresting 
voice of a prophet of God more needed than it is today. Tremendous 
forces of reconstruction are at work and their mighty currents are chang- 
ing the shore lines of our civilization. Millions of our people have lost 
their moorings. Civilization has reached the crossroads and the more 
serious minded leaders of the race are wondering where we are going." 

If this be the opinion of religious leaders of the world and they 
openly acknowledge that never in the history of the world has the arrest- 
ing voice of a prophet been so needed as it is today, why shouldn't we pray 
for faith and courage to follow the prophets the Lord has given us? So 
far as I am concerned I wish we as Latter-day Saints had the faith to 
follow these men whom God has chosen to lead us, endowed with the 
inspiration and revelation of heaven, so that their voices and their judg- 
ments and their instructions and their advice would have first place in 
our lives regardless of any political party or political doctrine. It seems 
to me that it has almost come to the point in our Church where even if they 
express their thoughts on some of the very fundamentals for which the 
Church has ever stood, for which every prophet in this great Church has 
stood, they are criticized by some of the brethren on the grounds that they 
are meddling in politics. 

WARNING OF DR. JOHN M. REINER 

There stood in this pulpit in January 1898 Dr. John M. Reiner, a 
Roman Catholic Priest of New York, who had been attending the meet- 
ings regularly for some time, and President Woodruff and Brother 
Penrose were on the stand. President Woodruff called him up to the 
pulpit. He stood here, and after giving the reasons why he had found 
it necessary, impelled by the reports he had heard, to make investigation 



BISHOP LeGRAND RICHARDS 



85 



of our claims, he made this statement : "The Church of God need never 
fear an enemy from without, but the enemy within your walls, he who 
walks with you side by side into your tabernacle, or into your temple, 
he who makes the same profession, he who speaks the same language, 
he who pretends to have the same religion and believe in the. same 
revelations and to be guided by the same authority, but whose heart is far 
from God and who lives an ungodly life. He is the worst enemy you 
have and in due time if you do not clean out your house from such people, 
God Himself will smite you with pestilence." 

I believe, my brothers and sisters, that our greatest danger as a people 
is from within, and I would like to believe that the Latter-day Saints 
believe in the leaders of this great Church to the point that they are willing 
to accept their counsel and advice. I think sometimes we almost bind them 
so that when they have the inspiration of Almighty God and would like 
to speak to us they hesitate for fear some of us will feel that they are 
interfering with political affairs. If I had my way I would weclome the 
day, come it as soon as God may grant, when these men with whom I am 
associated so intimately and whose very intimate thoughts I know and 
their desires for the welfare of this people and the welfare of the King- 
dom of God, might not only be issuing instructions to this great Church 
but to this great nation, which we are told is a land choice above all other 
lands and over which Christ our Lord, as decreed, shall reign, as King of 
Kings and Lord of Lords, because in this land it is decreed that the new 
Jerusalem of the Lord our God shall be established. 

A PRAYER ANSWERED 

I heard an experience the other day of one of our Stake Presidents, a 
grand and noble man, and I respect him, and I am going to take the 
liberty of repeating it here without mentioning names because it illustra- 
tes the kind of faith I think we ought to have in these leaders of ours. 
Sometime ago an article was published over the signature of the First 
Presidency and it seemed to irritate him and it irritated others because 
it dealt with some political measures, and he thought it was not right for 
the Presidency of this Church to express themselves on such matters. He 
went into his office to think it over, and he went into his private room 
and prayed about it. When he came out from that moment of prayer, 
he decided that if these men were prophets of God they had a right 
to speak, and it was his place and his responsibility to follow them and 
to respect their counsel and advice. That is the kind of faith I like to see 
in this Church. 

A LESSON IN THE SAVIOR'S WORDS TO PETER 

I think sometimes as I listen to men criticizing the leaders of the 
Church, and we have some among us who do that, of the words of the 
Savior to Peter of old. You will remember that constantly Peter was 
checked on by the Master, and shortly before His crucifixion, He said, 
"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift 
you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." Peter was sure 
he was converted and so he answered. "Lord, I am ready to go with Thee 
both into prison and to death". And He said, "I tell thee, Peter, the 
cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou 
knowest me." 

And so I feel sometimes when we are not willing to follow the counsel 
and advice of our leaders, in substance, we, as Peter of old, deny that 
we know them ; for surely we know them not in their true positions and 
in their true work as prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ except we be 
willing to follow them even though it be unto death itself. 

The Master said," They have Moses and the prophets ... if they hear 
not the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from 
the dead." 

God grant that ye may stand as united brethren and that we uphold 
those whom God has appointed to preside over us, and if we do this, my 
brethren and sisters, I have no fear but that this Church shall hurriedly 
and speedily take its place as God has decreed. God bless you all I pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Choir sang "Still, Still With Thee" by Shelley. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a source of great joy to me, my brothers and sisters and friends, 
to meet with you in the sessions of this Conference and to partake of 
the spirit of these gatherings. I rejoice greatly in the presence with us 
today of President Heber J. Grant in the measure of health and strength 
that he enjoys. I pray with you that he may continue to enjoy vigor 
and life and accomplish the mission which he has before him in great 
measure, as long as he desires. I pray for the blessings of the Lord to 
attend his Counselors. I sustain them fully and wholly, and I sustain 
all of the General Authorities and all the local authorities ; all the Stake 
Presidencies and Ward Bishoprics and Mission Presidents ; and all who 
have part in this work. I realize how great and responsible this work 
is, and what a joy there is in the accomplishment of righteous deeds. 
I pray that the Lord may bless me in the things I may have to say this 
afternoon. 

There have been many important messages presented to us today 
and yesterday. I sense all that has been said as being of great importance 
and welfare to us, and I desire that I may sustain in every respect the 
responsibilities that rest upon me, in common with you, to measure 
up to every duty and labor to the very fullest extent possible. I have 
in my heart nothing but great rejoicing in the work in which I am engaged 
with you and I desire to qualify in the fullest measure for every under- 
taking, responsibility, and blessing that the Lord has given me. I 
realize that the blessings of the Lord are with us. I realize that His 
desire is for our progress, our salvation, and our exaltation in every 
respect, to the extent that we will fulfil every commandment that He 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 87 



has given us. And so I say that I am prepared, and desire to measure 
up to every responsibility that the Lord has given. I have great joy 
and satisfaction in consideration of the kindness shown to me by my 
brethren, and by all of you, my brethren and sisters. 

My mind has rested to some extent on the responsibilities of the 
Priesthood, but this subject has been touched upon by some who have 
spoken, so I have decided to speak of other things. 

HUMAN AND DIVINE GOVERNMENT 

There are many principles revealed and many covenants made by 
the Lord with His children who have taken upon them His name to 
serve Him. There are other agreements or covenants made by men one 
with another which are to do with civil affairs, and are intended to be 
honorably complied with. We call these agreements or covenants. The 
agreements or promises made to mankind by the Lord are in the nature 
of divine covenants, or divine understandings, and these the Lord has 
made to His children, through His faithful servants. To the extent that 
mankind has fulfilled the conditions they have received the blessings 
and the promises the Lord has made. 

I might relate a number of these things. You are familiar with 
them in the history of the world and the hand-dealings of the Lord with 
His children. He made promises to Adam that he should have dominion 
over every living thing. Adam was true to his covenants and he fulfilled 
his part. And so it has been with Enoch and with Noah. When Noah re- 
ceived the commandment of the Lord he fulfilled that covenant faithfully 
and received a blessing. So with Moses and other ancient prophets. Com- 
ing down through the various dispensations we find that John the Baptist 
received the authority and followed the instructions of the Lord to preach 
the Gospel. To him was given authority to perform the ordinance of 
baptism upon those who manifested repentance ; who first had faith in 
God, and who had grown in the spirit of repentance and the desire 
to be forgiven of their transgressions or shortcomings. John the Baptist 
received the keys of that authority and held them in all the centuries 
from the time of the Savior until the nineteenth century. And the 
Savior himself gave to mankind the promise that through faith in God 
and through repentance they could be baptized and receive the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, whereby they should receive the confirmation of the 
baptism by fire and the Holy Ghost. 

COVENANTS IN THIS DISPENSATION 

In this dispensation the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph many 
things and gave him instructions, and among other instructions which 
were given and blessings which he received was the restoration of the 
holy sacrament of the Lord's supper; and in like manner the eternal 
covenant of marriage, — one of the greatest promises made to men in 
earlier days which has been restored again in these days. 

How sacred and important it is that men and women should qualify 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

— those who have accepted the truths of this Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and have received authority of the holy Priesthood by divine restoration 
— to partake of the spirit of this responsibility and this covenant, and to 
enter into that promise and that blessing. We and our children are entitled 
to receive these blessings if we live for them, and observe them with all 
our hearts, in love and kindliness, in justice and righteousness. 

THE COVENANT OF ETERNAL MARRIAGE 

Now my brethren and sisters, I consider this quite important. I 
felt I would like to talk briefly about this particular covenant the Lord 
has given. In earlier days, in the early history; of mankind, we 
are told that for this cause should a man leave father and mother and 
cleave unto his wife, and they twain should be one flesh. We are intelli- 
gent beings. We are eternal beings, and inasmuch as we try to do the 
will of the Lord and keep His commandments He will bless us and 
fulfil His promises to us. And so, in this latter day, He has given this 
covenant through the authority of the holy Priesthood, restored again 
in these days, whereby His sons and daughters who have observed to 
do His will and have received the authority and fulfilled the covenants 
shall be entitled to go forward and be united for time and for eternity, 
and that that covenant should be binding upon them to the extent that 
they live for it throughout all time. It is a remarkable thing to think 
about, to realize what eternity means. It sobers one considerably when 
one thinks of entering into a covenant of this kind, not only for this 
life, but for the life to come. It justifies very careful consideration on 
the part of those who enter into it. The man and the woman should be 
worthy ; they should exemplify in their lives every principle of the Gospel 
to the very best o E their ability, and they should strive to grow in patience 
and in kindliness, in good-will and love towards each other, and especially 
try to exemplify the finest and highest principles of the Gospel and of 
the Priesthood they have received. 

A PRINCIPLE WITH PROMISE 

The Prophet Joseph Smith received many instructions in this last 
dispensation of the fulness of times, and among them were other com- 
mandments and other instructions given of the Lord, one of which was 
the principle of tithing, which is the Law of the Lord, given to mankind 
that through their faithful observance of that principle they should 
grow in righteousness and in truth, and be prospered. It is a principle 
with a promise, and all Latter-day Saints who have undertaken to observe 
that principle are blessed, blessed particularly spiritually, but also pros- 
pered temporally, so that they are able to meet their obligations. I testify 
to the truth of this, because I know the Lord is a loving Father. He has 
given us great blessings in the observance of this as well as of every 
other commandment. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE 

With regard to the matter of marriage and divorce, not only in this 
nation, but in all the nations of the world, I would like to say that scandal- 
ous conditions prevail to a large extent. People have neglected eternal 
marriage ; they have done away with the eternal covenant and have 
substituted therefor civil covenants which endure only until death. 

Conditions throughout the nations referred to are far from what they 
should be. Instead of marriage being recognized as a sacred covenant, as 
given by the Lord to mankind, it is too often a temporary tie between 
man and wife, subject to divorce. Such conditions I say are too prev- 
alent in the world. Men and women are too illy situated to sense the 
seriousness and the vitality, importance and righteousness of the eternal 
covenant. 

CAUSES OF DIVORCE 

In going over some of the causes of divorce in this nation I find 
that there are three main causes: First is cruelty. Generally speaking 
that is more prevalent in the case of the woman, who feels she is unfairly 
treated by her husband. Thirty-two per cent of the cases of divorce are 
for cruelty ; twenty-eight percent are for the cause of desertion ; and 
seven and one-half per cent for adultery, which is a very serious charge. 
These are some of the causes which bring about divorces and are obtained 
by women, which would indicate that the women are more badly treated 
by their husbands than the husbands by the wives. 

There are more legal causes for divorce on the part of the wife 
than the husband. One-third of the divorces occur after four years or less 
of marriage. One third of the divorces are from five to nine years ; 
and one-third of divorces are for over ten years. That indicates something 
of the conditions with regard to that principle. 

The Ladies Home Journal, about a year or two ago, made a survey 
of the causes of divorce. They found that sixty-nine percent of the women 
believe in divorce. Money, they say, is the chief cause of friction. 
Young people, they find from the conclusions, should be taught more 
about sex before they are married. Sex instructions, they say, should 
be given by their parents. 

Now, these are some of the conditions which prevail in the world. 
The Latter-day Saints generally believe whole-heartedly, thoroughly, 
loyally, truly and eternally, in the principle of eternal marriage — marriage 
for eternity as well as for time — and yet there are many young people 
in the Church who are not subscribing to this condition — this eternal 
covenant. They are missing a great opportunity. Too many hasty mar- 
riages are very often the occasion for hasty divorces. But those who 
enter into the covenant of eternal marriage, in my judgment, are those 
who carefully consider what they are doing, wisely, prayerfully, and 
earnestly striving to be led and guided into righteousness, so that they 
resist hasty marriage and every influence that is not in harmony with the 
Spirit of the Lord. 

As an example of what has been achieved by the Latter-day Saints 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

in overcoming- this condition of hasty marriages and divorces, and the 
tendency to disregard the covenants that are made, I want to call your 
attention to the records, because the Church has kept a record for years 
with regard to these statistics which are of concern to us. They have 
been kept as accurately as they could be obtained. 

STATISTICAL COMPARISONS 

I should like to refer you to certain results which indicate some of 
the comparisons of marriage and divorce in the nation of the United 
States as compared with those of the Latter-day Saints. The last year 
of which we have records was in 1938. The marriage rate of the United 
States as a whole was 10.41 per thousand population, as compared with 
17.5% per thousand population of the Latter-day Saints, which is 
70% greater. The divorce rate was 1.71 per thousand population as 
against 1.04 for the Latter-day Saints. This was about 40% less. But that 
result was obtained from the record of civil marriages, and not from those 
performed in the temples of the Lord. In the Latter-day Saint Temples 
where such ordinances are performed the result was, for those who 
entered into marriage for eternity .28 per thousand population, or about 
83% less. That indicates something of the difference where people 
observe this covenant that the Lord has given for our eternal welfare. 

It is a matter of great importance to every Latter-day Saint. 
Worthy parents sense the importance of teaching their children this 
eternal principle. Stake Presidencies, Bishoprics, and all the officers 
throughout the Church realize that in teaching this divine principle they 
are instructing worthy young people in the proper observance of an 
eternal principle of great promise and blessing to all who righteously 
observe it. 

This is one of the great things to think about, that the covenants 
they make in this life will endure for eternity, if they live in harmony 
therewith. The blessings of God will attend those bonds if worthily 
observed. The conclusions are that those who do these things through 
their willingness and righteous desires to observe these commandments, 
grow in virtue and regard the sacredness of the covenants and generally 
are more faithful and dependable and worthy than those who marry 
for time only. 

WHAT OTHERS SAY ABOUT US 

Now I would like to say another word. Some time ago I noticed a 
newspaper article coming from the Coast with regard to eugenics and 
marital conditions among the Christian peoples of this nation. This 
briefly states that Dr. Paul Poponoe, social expert and director of the 
Institute of Family Relations, addressing the California division of the 
American Eugenics Society, referred to an investigation made by Dr. 
Ellsworth Huntington of Yale University in the following words : "Dr. 
Ellsworth Huntington at Yale University has calculated the number of 
great grandchildren likely to represent the present day leaders in the 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



91 



United States. This is based on a study of persons listed in 'Who's 
Who,' and therefore represents the fertility only of eminent persons, 
not of the rank and file. He finds the Mormons have a prospective 
advantage of more than 400 per cent over their nearest competitors. 
Jews are almost at the bottom of the list. 

"From the sample in 'Who's Who,' 1000 leading adherents of the 
Mormon faith at the present day will be represented by 10,200 great 
grandchildren. 

"A thousand Lutherans will have only 1950 great grandchildren; 
Baptists 1560; Methodists 1458; Roman Catholics 1310; Congregation- 
alists 1125; Unitarians 1025; Episcopalians 910; Jews 755; and Uni- 
versalists 500. 

"The low birthrate of the modern Jew is almost world-wide." 

Now, that is a challenge to mankind as to what the Latter-day 
Saints, who are faithful in the observance of this eternal covenant, 
represent in comparison with mankind generally. Prominent people in 
other churches, because they have not observed to do these things which 
make for greater stability, greater love, greater patience, greater con- 
sideration, and every other quality, are not able to measure up to the 
same standards as the Latter-day Saints have achieved. 

May the Lord bless us and help every one of us to strive to harmonize 
our desires with our families to these fine standards that we have referred 
to that the Lord has established. He is blessing mankind to the extent 
that we live and keep His commandments, and I testify to you that 
these principles are true. The Lord is kindly towards His people. May 
His blessings continually attend us. I testify to you that this is His work, 
the restoration of the Gospel in these days. These brethren who preside 
over us are men who are guided by the inspiration and power of the 
Lord. I pray that we may desire to live in such a way that we may be 
worthy of the trust vested in us, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

■ 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

You brethren, returned Mission Presidents, we shall now turn to 
you to give us the balance of the afternoon. Again I suggest to you that 
we should like to hear as many as we can. We can hear more if you 
will speak five minutes and quit than if you speak ten minutes, and any- 
thing under five minutes is five minutes. 

Will Brother William T. Tew, Jr., formerly president of the East 
Central States Mission please come to the stand. 

ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, JR. 

Former President of the East Central States Mission 

I am very happy to be here this afternoon and to take the place 
of my old friend, A. Richard Peterson. We were together in school, 
preparing for our missions abroad. In years past we both filled missions 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday. October 5 Second Day 

in foreign lands, and we have also been in foreign lands and at home 
presiding over missions during the past few years. 

I am happy to be here today to mingle with my brethren and sisters 
in this great tabernacle. We have been thrilled today listening to this 
great choir — the harmony, the volume, the fervor, the enthusiasm, the 
inspiration that seems to fill these singers has in turn thrilled this 
audience and the unseen audience that perhaps numbers hundreds* of 
thousands. 

Since returning home about five or six weeks ago I have been asked 
many times, "Are you glad to be home?" I can honestly say to my 
brothers and sisters that I am glad to be home. I was glad when I was 
in the mission field, but when my mission was completed and I was re- 
leased, why shouldn't I be glad to be back among my brethren ? I believe 
that when one puts his whole soul into the missionary work for a period 
of three years or more, he deserves a release. If he doesn't put his soul 
into it, he deserves a release long before the three years are up. 

We have had great joy in our mission. The Lord has blessed us 
with health and strength, and He has increased our testimonies of the 
Gospel. We have had great joy in mingling with our Saints abroad, 
many of whom are here today at this great Conference. We have 
enjoyed the companionship, the loyalty and love of your boys and girls 
who have been sent there as missionaries. I want to tell you, my brethren 
and sisters, there is nothing in the world more dear to me than the love 
of these young people who have filled honorable missions in the mission 
field. They are an inspiration to those who labor among them ; they are 
the stalwart defenders of the faith ; they are the "hope of Israel" because 
the "hope of Israel" is the youth of Zion. The future of this Church 
and the salvation of our Church rests with the youth. 

My brethren and sisters and friends, I have been impressed very 
much within the last few days studying things regarding our Savior's 
life. One of the things that occurred to me last evening as well as this 
afternoon is the experience of our Savior as a boy of twelve in the 
temple of the Lord. When His mother sought Him she found Him 
both asking and answering questions among the wise men and lawyers 
of the temple. His question to her was, "Wist ye* not that I must be 
about my Father's business?" I do not know any greater ideal, any 
greater goal or objective in life that you and I can have, or that young 
people can have in their souls than the one embodied in that question. 
We should be about our Father's business, and the question arises in turn, 
"What is our Father's business ?" 

We have been told that the Lord's work and the Lord's glory is 
to bring to pass man's immortality and man's eternal life ; and eternal 
life we are told is a quality of life, the kind of life that God Himself 
lives, that kind of life that Jesus, the Christ, came to give — life abundant, 
rich and full and joyful. That is the Lord's business ; that is my business 
as one of His children ; that is your business, my brethren and sisters, as 
the children of the Lord. Though we grant the fact that the Lord is 
Omnipotent, it seems to me that in this realm of His work, bringing 



ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY 



93 



to pass man's eternal life, the Lord does need you and me, because I 
claim — I may be wrong — but I claim the Lord cannot give me eternal 
life, that quality of life, that degree of joy which is celestial, unless I 
am willing to do my duty and keep His commandments, assist my fellow 
men in learning His commandments and encouraging them in keeping 
those commandments. 

I am sure the Lord spoke a glorious truth when he said to Oliver 
Cowdery and others : "If you should labor all your days in crying re- 
pentance unto this people, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how 
great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father !" 

And so we have rejoiced in the mission field in devoting ourselves 
to the service of the Lord. We have brought into the Church in the 
last three years between twelve and thirteen hundrd souls, converts and 
children. We have traveled over a hundred thousand miles. I have 
attended and preached in more than a thousand meetings. How much 
good has been done rests of course with the future. 

My brethren and sisters, we have increased in testimony. We bear 
our testimony to you this afternoon that this is the work of the Lord, 
and the only way to bring peace and joy to the world is by knowing 
the Lord's commandments and by keeping them. 

My five minutes are up. From the bottom of my heart, I want to ' 
thank the parents of those boys and girls who have served in the mission 
field. I do thank them and am grateful for their lives, for their devotion 
and for their service. May the Lord bless these young people at home 
that they may keep in the harness, that they may be kept in the faith, 
that they may be an inspiration to all those with whom they associate, 
I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY 

Former President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I desire to take this occasion to express the gratitude that Sister 
Nibley and I feel for the opportunity we have had to serve as missionaries 
in the Northwestern States Mission. This was my second mission, and it 
was her first. I can say that we enjoyed every minute of our time. 

We were sent out, according to President McKay, for two and a 
half to three years, but we remained there three years and eight months. 

Oregon was not a new country to us, as my father had been there 
many years previously, and I had been there as a child. We have thou- 
sands of Latter-day Saints in the northwest, and many more are migrat- 
ing out there on account of business and other opportunities. Besides 
the Portland and Seattle Stakes we have some ninety-two branches and 
Sunday Schools. We left 130 missionaries, whom we dearly love. 

When I received my release from the First Presidency, I did not 
know whether I wanted to come home or not, I felt so interested in my 
work. I remembered what my father told me about his mother when she 
was dying ; she turned to him and said : "Charlie, this dying is no doings 
of mine." (Laughter) 



r 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Saturday, October 5 Second Day 

One of the things which has pleased us has been the fine leadership 
we have had from President Grant and his Counselors. As Bishop 
Richards said, so I say, that the Latter-day Saints have the finest leader- 
ship in the world, our First Presidency. I express my loyalty to them. 
No one wrote me more frequently than President Grant, kind, loving, 
encouraging letters. I received many from him. When I opened his 
letters and read : "Dear Preston," and found that they closed, "Yours 
affectionately, Heber J. Grant," I felt close to my President. He was 
my President thirty-five years ago when I was a missionary in Europe, 
and now he is nearing his eighty-fourth birthday, and I thank my 
Heavenly Father that he has been preserved to us. 

President McKay has been all that a brother and leader, could be, 
and we have loved him and his leadership, and we love him now. I did 
not hear from President Clark so frequently, but President Qark, I 
always knew you were there, and I knew you were back of us. 

Brother and sisters, we tried to look after your missionaries. We 
never took our eyes away from them ; we watched them by day and by 
night, and encouraged them so that they would return home and be an 
honor to you. We watched their health, we watched everything pertain- 
ing to them. 

I think our converts are being made in the northwest principally 
through the Latter-day Saints who reside there. They bring their neigh- 
bors to Church, and we are baptizing the neighbors of our Saints. Many 
hundreds have joined the Church. During our presidency over 2,000 
were baptized in the Northwestern States Mission. 

Now, with the other mission presidents here, I do not know whether 
I should say it or not, but during the first six months of this year the 
Northwestern States Mission led the Missions of the United States 
in tracts distributed and Gospel conversations, and in baptisms per 
missionary. 

I am grateful that we received an honorable release from the First 
Presidency. We are happy to be home, and we shall continue to serve 
in any capacity to which the Brethren call us. 

I bear you my testimony that this is the work of God, that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, sent to restore the Gospel in this last dispensa- 
tion. I leave you this testimony, and I do it humbly, in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang "I Will Give Thanks Unto the Lord," by Campbell- 
Tipton. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

I am afraid, my brethren and sisters, you will have to say that this 
choir is better than we were. I thank them, and I thank their employers 
who permit them to come and sing for us so beautifully this afternoon. 

Elder Asael E. Palmer, President of the Lethbridge Stake, offered 
th closing prayer. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 95 



THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, October 6. 

The great Tabernacle was crowded to capacity with people who had 
assembled many of them more than an hour in advance of the time to 
begin this session, to listen to the Conference proceedings. The large 
Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle was also crowded 
with people, and thousands in addition assembled upon the Tabernacle 
grounds, where, by means of amplifying equipment that had been in- 
stalled, they listened to the services as given in the Tabernacle. 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., who conducted, opened the meet- 
ing promptly at 10 o'clock. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

There are literally thousands of people who cannot get in the 
Tabernacle at all this morning, and hundreds are standing in the en- 
trances and aisles. Please do the -best you can to give some of them 
seats. On the sides, too, as well as the center, and up in the gallery. 
Be good enough to move as close together as possible. It would be very 
helpful. 

We are again blessed with the presence of President Grant, who 
will preside at this meeting and who will speak to us. He has asked 
me to conduct the services. 

The music this morning will be by the Tabernacle Choir, under the 
direction of J. Spencer Cornwall. Elder Alexander Schreiner is at the 
organ. 

The hymn, "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning," (By Wil- 
liam W. Phelps), was sung by the choir and congregation. 

Elder John B. Reed, President of the San Luis Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

GRATITUDE FOR FAITH OF PEOPLE 

It is needless for me to tell you good people how grateful I am 
to be here today. I missed the Conference six months ago, and I am 
grateful beyond expression to all of you good people, to the Saints gen- 
erally, and to some people who are not members of our Church for your 
and their faith and prayers in my behalf that I should be healed. I 
am grateful to the doctors who so kindly, carefully, and energetically 
at home, and while in Los Angeles, gave me the benefit of their services. 

I lack the capacity to express the gratitude and thanksgiving in my 
heart for the blessings of the Lord to me and this people. I humbly 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

pray that while I am speaking to you this morning the Spirit of the Lord 
may be and abide with me. I do not expect, however, to preach to you this 
morning, I simply desire to express my gratitude to the Lord, and I 
expect to have the pleasure this afternoon, as my doctor, Silas Smith, 
consented that I may speak again, at the close of the Conference. 

KINDNESS ACKNOWLEDGED 

I am grateful to my friends in California, to my relatives and to 
my railroad, banking and insurance friends, to Mr. Chandler of the 
Los Angeles Times, and to all of the officials of the Church in California, 
because of their fine attention to me and their interest in my welfare. I 
am grateful for the fine treatment I receivd at the Catholic Hospital in 
Los Angeles. 

I am very thankful for our fine Conference, for the wonderful 
attendance here today, and for the magnificent body of the Priesthood 
that were together last night. 

THE FILM "BRIGHAM YOUNG" COMMENDED 

I am thankful beyond expression for the very wonderful and splen- 
did moving picture that has been made of Brigham Young. I have heard 
some little criticism of it, but we cannot expect the people who do not 
know that Brigham Young was in very deed the representative of God 
upon this earth, who do not know his wonderful character, to tell the 
story as we would tell it. We know that he was a prophet of the living 
God and the representative of the Lord here upon the earth. There is 
nothing in the picture that reflects in any way against our people. It is a 
very marvelous and wonderful thing, considering how people generally 
have treated us and what they have thought of us. Of course there are 
many things in the picture that are not strictly correct, and that is 
announced in the picture itself. It is of course a picture and we could 
not hope that they would make a picture at their expense, running into a 
couple of million dollars, to be just as we would like it. We know that 
Brigham Young was a powerful and wonderful man, the greatest man 
of his day, and one of the great things about Brigham Young was that 
he always gave credit to Joseph Smith for everything that he did. He 
claimed that he was simply building upon the foundation laid by the 
prophet of God, who had seen God and conversed with Jesus Christ. 
He never doubted for one minute the final triumph of the people here in 
Utah. He was a man of God, and the people thought the world and all 
of him. 

THE CHURCH MAKING FRIENDS 

I am very thankful for the health of the people. I am very thankful 
for the very marvelous and wonderful change that I find wherever I go 
in the attitude towards the Mormon people. To be known as a Mormon, 
living the Gospel of Jesus Christ, is a recommendation to all those that 
know us as a people. As the years come and go the Word of Wisdom 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



97 



and all the various teachings and doctrines laid down by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and so faithfully and strongly carried out by Brigham 
Young are making us friends all over the world. 

BLESSING AND PRAYER FOR PEACE 

The doctor told me I could have five or six minutes, or even ten. 
I have occupied only about five, but as I am going to talk to you again at 
the close of the conference, and as I do not want to overdo in the least 
degree, I shall simply say, God bless you, one and all. God bless the 
honest the world over. God bless all good people, and hasten the day 
when people shall seek to God for guidance and direction, when wars 
will cease and peace will reign, is my prayer, and I ask it in humility 
and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. I bless you by 
the authority of the holy Priesthood of the living God that I hold, and I 
do it in the name of Christ, our Redeemer, Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

President Grant : words cannot express the gratitude of the people 
for your presence, your message, and the degree of health which you 
have. May the Lord continue to bless you is the prayer of all the 
people of the Church. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am delighted, brethren and sisters, with this opportunity of stand- 
ing before you for just a few short minutes this morning. The gathering 
of men who were here in this building last night, and the gatherings of 
men and women who have been here during this Conference, give new 
testimony to the fact that there is in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints still a fervent faith in God, our heavenly Father. 

PESSIMISM AND OPTIMISM 

There are people in the Church who have the temerity to say that 
our condition is such as to justify, perhaps, God our heavenly Father in 
taking the Gospel from us. I have had at least one man cite to me the 
sixteenth chapter of Third Nephi, tenth and eleventh verses, in which 
God says that when certain conditions shall prevail within the Church, 
He will take the Gospel from us, citing as justification the fact that 
we are now in such a condition that we might lose it — a pessimistic view, 
indeed, I take it. 

I insist on feeling, brethren and sisters, that I am an optimist. As 
I move about among you people I have many opportunities to see how you 
feel, to realize your trust in God our heavenly Father, and I believe that 
there is in the Church today still the same faith that characterized our 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



grandfathers and grandmothers when this Church was re-established in 
our dispensation. 

If you will permit, I would like to cite you just one or two instances 
which make me feel this way. 



One time when I was in the Mexican Mission I passed through 
a little town in Arizona, and asked a man how he felt regarding the 
depression. He said: "We feel just as we always do, Brother Ivins. 
It is always depression in this section." I happened to know that that 
man had a family of six or eight, and that every boy and girl that he 
had, who was of age, had performed a mission for the Church, one of 
them at that very time serving in the Mission over which I had the 
privilege of presiding. 

Not very many weeks ago a man came into my office with his son. 
He said : "Brother Ivins, I am presenting this son for a mission." The 
few questions that I directed to him brought out the fact that this was 
the ninth child of his to fulfil a mission for the Church ; that in addition 
to those nine, he had supported his brother on a mission, and was at that 
very time supporting a man, who was not of his family, in the New 
England States Mission. 

One time when I was interviewing a young man in Idaho, his father 
having brought him in, said: "Brother Ivins, we recommend this boy 
for a short-term mission. If, however, the leaders of the Church feel 
that he should serve a full term, they are welcome to his services, but in 
that event my wife and I will be forced to sacrifice our home, which 
represents the savings of our lifetime. We are willing to do it if the 
Church requires it." 

Those things indicate to me that in those instances, at least, there 
is a fine degree of faith within the Church. As we move around we inter- 
view prospective missionaries who are to be called to go out into the 
world, and we ask them some very pertinent and sometimes very delicate 
questions, to find out just what their attitude is, and how they have lived. 
I find, to my utter pleasure and satisfaction, that almost without 
exception those young men and young women are able to tell me, and 
look me honestly in the eye when they do it, that in preparation for this 
great event in their lives they have lived clean and pure lives. 

Now, when that type of faith exists within the Church I am not 
particularly worried as to the future. I feel that God is going to be 
justified in honoring the Priesthood which He has here in the Church at 
this time, and that He will not feel like taking the Gospel from us. 



iO' l KsWe had portrayed the accomplishments of the Church Welfare 
work, the other day, in the program of one of these meetings. Nobody 
can look at those things and tell me that there is not faith still in the 
Church. I think we are meeting those problems with a wonderful display 



FAITH IN MISSIONARY WORK 



4 



LOVE OF NEIGHBOR EXHIBITED IN WELFARE WORK 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



99 



of faith. It gives me an unbounded satisfaction to realize that men are 
willing to devote their time and their talents, not only without compensa- 
tion, but at their expense, for the welfare of their fellows. 

The injunction of Christ was that we should love God, our heavenly 
Father, first, and our neighbor second ; and this is indication to me that 
we do, most of us at least, love our neighbors, for we are willing to work 
for them, and work for them for nothing, help them over their pitfalls 
and out of their troubles, and to a higher state of living. 

Now, why should we be terribly pessimistic over this outlook, when 
we realize that those conditions prevail? We do recognize the fact, 
however, that there are conditions within the Church which need rectify- 
ing. There are too few of us who are living fully and completely up to 
our opportunities. 

MELCHIZEDEK PRIESTHOOD PERCENTAGES 

I have had the privilege of checking, this year, the relationship 
between the number of families in the Church and the number of mem- 
bers in the Melchizedek Priesthood. I find that in some of the Stakes the 
proportion between families in the Stake and members of the Melchizedek 
Priesthood is as low as fifty-five. In other places it runs up to eighty-eight 
or ninety. In Colonia Juarez, the other day, I checked that very item, 
and I found those people down there having representatives in the 
Melchisedek Priesthood to the extent of eighty-eight per cent of their 
families, I believe ; but just recently another Stake checked as low as 
fifty-five. 

What does this mean? It means, to me, that too few of us are 
taking advantage of the sealing ordinances in the temple. Things like 
that, and other things, need rectifying, to be sure, but I insist, and I 
leave it to you as my testimony, that there is within this Church an 
honest, true faith in God our heavenly Father, and I think the mani- 
festations of these Conference meetings bear me out in that testimony. 

I pray that God will help us to keep it bright within our hearts, 
that we may never falter in His service, and that He will be pleased to 
honor us and bless us in our operations. God bless you all, Amen. 

TABERNACLE CHOIR AND ORGAN BROADCAST 

During the period from 10:30 to 11:00 a. m., the regular weekly 
National Broadcast of choral and organ music and brief spoken com- 
ment was included as part of the Conference proceedings. This program, 
now in its twelfth year of continuous nationwide broadcasting was pre- 
sented by the Tabernacle Choir and Organ, and broadcast through the 
courtesy and facilities of the Columbia Broadcasting system network, 
throughout the United States and Canada, and by short-wave transmis- 
sion to many foreign lands. This broadcast originated with Radio Sta- 
tion KSL, Salt Lake City, and, exclusive of routine introductory and 
closing announcements, was as follows :

Announcer, Richard L. Evans : "And Jesus made as though he would 
have gone . . . But they constrained Him, saying, Abide with us : for it is 
toward evening, and the day is far spent." (Luke 24 :28-29) And blessed 
are they who abide His coming, as the gathering storm and the growing 
darkness of our times bring with them those events that move us on 
toward another eventide of which the prophets of all generations have 
spoken. And there is that about the record of prophecy which, even 
though it may not be pleasant to our ears, strikes conviction to our souls. 
For "all things must come to pass in their time." (Doctrine and Covenants 
64:32) Time and the relentless march of events brought by its passing 
have been portrayed in musical symbol by the composer Vierne, and 
we now hear "Westminster Chimes" moving with the sweep of the 
hours and the march of the years — but "the day or the hour no man 
knoweth; but it shall surely come." (Doctrine and Covenants 39:21). 

"Westminster Chimes" — Vierne ..Organ 

Announcer, Richard L. Evans: And then Stephen said unto them: 
"As your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your 
fathers persecuted ?" This accusing question could be asked of any genera- 
tion, for men have always persecuted those who have seen ahead of their 
own time — whose vision has been enlarged and whose understanding has 
been quickened by that Spirit which giveth light to every man that cometh 
into the world (Doc. and Cov. 84:46) — in all fields of thought and 
knowledge, pertaining both to things here and things hereafter. The 
Isaiahs, the Galileos, the Noahs and the Columbuses, the Peters and the 
Pauls, have never been popular in their own day — but they have been 
so right in spite of the unwillingness of their own generation to believe 
them. And it would not seem to be popular to say now in our day that 
the unprincipled chaos in which we find our world was foreseen by 
the prophets of God and will find no cure and no lasting peace until men 
turn to Him and pattern their lives in accordance with His ways. Mere 
lip service will not be acceptable, and the temporary repentance that is 
forced by immediate fear and present stress will not be mistaken for 
obedience and a contrite heart. Let the cynic enjoy his brief day ; let 
the man without faith deny it, and let the unbelieving take such hope 
as they can find. But the unchangeable facts remain, and there rise to 
meet the dissenting chorus, the words of Stephen: "Which of the 
prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? And when they heard these 
things, they were cut to the heart . . . And they stoned Stephen." (Acts 
7:51-59) "And he kneeled down and cried: To thee O Lord I yield my 
spirit." This event of New Testament record was given musical setting 
by Mendelssohn in the St. Paul from which Richard Condie and the 
Tabernacle choir now sing.

Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 

For nearly twenty centuries millions of Christians have prayed for 
the coming of the Kingdom of God, and for more than twenty centuries 
millions of people have persistently rejected the conditions indispensable 
to the realization of this era of peace and brotherly kindness. 

Even though the essentials for a better world have not been generally 
accepted, yet mankind has ever striven for a better way of living. In 
every progressive age of the world's history thinking people have been 
dissatisfied with their current social and economic conditions, and have 
sought for remedial changes. Many of their hoped-for Utopias, however, 
though they have inspired men to action, have ended only as dreams 
and phantasies. 

In response to this urge for change, the twentieth century is no 
exception. Indeed, during the last fifty years people have witnessed 
greater political unrest, more stupendous upheavals than have probably 
• occurred in the same length of time in the history of the world. European 
monarchies have been overthrown, and rising out of the monarchial ruins 
have come the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia, the Fascist regime 
in Italy, the Nazi rule in Germany, and the Fascist form of government 
in Spain. Democracy, as exemplified in Great Britain and her dominions, 
and in the United States, has successfully withstood the battling horrors 
of a World War, and now, after only a quarter of a century, is again 
either actually participating in or standing on the brink of a second 
devastating conflict. 

If, in the spirit of charity, we say that misguided men have brought 
all this about because of their desire for a better government, the fact 
still remains that civilization is encompassed by social upheavals that 
threaten to divert if not entirely thwart the progress and happiness of 
the present generation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



FUNDAMENTALS IN DISCARD 

Humanity is passing through one of its most crucial experiences. We 
are in the midst of a revolution both of thought and mode of life. Beliefs 
of parents are questioned, old ideals are in the discard. Communism, 
Naziism, Fascism, Totalitarianism are giving birth to new conceptions 
that strike relentlessly at beliefs and teachings which were accepted a 
decade ago as fundamentals and unassailable. "Under the influence of a 
science as superficial as proud," writes M. Paul Gaul tier, a leading 
publicist of France, "old beliefs have been turned into ridicule, conscience 
is treated as a superstition, and honesty as a prejudice. Self-interest 
alone remains as a motive, and pleasure as the sole end of life. For 
too many people," he continues, "evil consists not in infringing social 
laws, but in getting caught. Morality and duty figure in their eyes as 
so many prejudices out of fashion, and vestiges of centuries gone by." 

Granting the severity of this arraignment, the fact still remains that 
moral and religious skepticism is too generally apparent, and political 
chicanery, fraud, and civic unrighteousness all too common. 

In the words of an assistant Secretary of State: "We seem to be 
slipping backward in the long march of progress. We are in danger of 
losing part of the precious heritage for which our ancestors fought and 
gave their lives. Human liberty, democracy, parliamentary government, 
freedom of speech, tolerance, faith — these in important parts of the 
world have ceased to exist. Autocracy and dictatorships are demanding 
men's allegiance. Political institutions are cracking ominously. Demo- 
cratic government is fighting for its life." 

To climax these distracting conditions, war, with all its attendant 
horrors, is sweeping the earth as a devastating conflagration, leaving in its 
wake only ashes, agony, and death. 

Truly, the time has come as perhaps never before when men should 
counsel together, and in wisdom determine how the world may be made 
a better place in which to live. 

THE PERFECT GUIDE 

To achieve this desired end, the first and most important step is to 
choose as leader one whose leadership is infallible, whose teachings when 
practiced have never failed. In the present tempestuous sea of Uncertain- 
ty, the Pilot must be one who through the storm can see the beacon in the 
harbor of peace. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims that 
there is but one such Guiding Hand in the Universe, but one unfailing 
Light, and that the Light of Christ who said : "I am come that they might 
have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." An active, 
sincere faith in the basic teachings of Jesus of Nazareth is the greatest 
need of the world. Because many reject this truth is all the more reason 
why sincere believers should proclaim it. 

The ultimate purpose of Christianity is to develop honorable, upright 
individuals in an ideal society known as the Kingdom of God. No one. 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



103 



not even the unbeliever, can gainsay this as a most worthy goal. True, 
nearly two thousand years of trial have failed to bring about even an 
approach to the realization of either the perfecting of the individual or 
the establishing of an ideal society. As a result, Christianity and its 
handmaiden, Democracy, are now on trial before the world tribunal. 
The fact is, however, that conditions in this war-torn world instead of 
proving, that Christianity has failed, emphatically bear witness that men 
are forever learning, but never coming to a knowledge of the truth ; or, 
as one man cynically remarked, "Men's lives consist mostly in making 
the same mistakes over again." 

Christianity, as summarized in the divine admonition, "Love the 
Lord thy God, and thy neighbor as thyself" has never yet been accepted 
and practiced by the nations of the world. Were that principle even 
partly applied, our advanced scientific knowledge, our almost unlimited 
mechanized power, our unexcelled opportunities for education would 
be directed, not as now, for the destruction of human beings, but for 
the betterment of individuals, and for the advancement and redemption 
of mankind. 

As the first essential to a better world, therefore, we declare with the 
Apostle Peter that there is "none, other name under heaven given among 
men whereby we must be saved." 

IMPROVEMENT IN MORALS 

It is charged that "one of the distinctive traits of modern society in 
every country is the sinking of the moral ideal in the minds and life of 
the people." Manifestly, then, a second essential in world betterment 
is the raising of the moral standard. 

If anyone listening in is saying to himself "this is trite," then I say 
such a thought itself justifies the call for men who will re-dedicate them- 
selves to the principles of honesty, justice, tolerance, and love, and who 
will practice these virtues in their business and professional activities. 
"And this life is possible," as someone has declared, "in social conditions 
the most diverse, and with natural gifts the most unequal. It is not 
fortune, or personal advantage, but our turning them to account that 
constitutes the value of life." "Nothing," says Emerson, "can bring 
you peace but the triumph of principles." 

In the light of political scandals recently disclosed in some of our 
States, what a brilliant though discarded gem, for example, is the plain, 
every-day principle of honesty. Though as genuine as the blue-tinted 
diamond, how little it is valued in a world where "business is honey- 
combed with dishonesty, and the political world abounds in duplicity and 
chicanery." Even to repeat such a charge makes one feel heavy-hearted. 
In contrast, recall the calm assurance, the confidence that pervades your 
soul when you konw you are in the presence of one whom you can trust. 
Let us re-polish, and make more brilliant this old-fashioned principle so 
essential to human happiness. Would that all men and nations might 
unite with the Church in saying: 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 6 Third Day 

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in do- 
ing good to all men. 

A RE-DEDICATION TO PRINCIPLES OF UNSELFISHNESS 

Man needs a re-dedication to the principles of unselfishness. No 
peace or freedom can come to this world so long as men live only for 
themselves. It is true that self-preservation is the first law of nature, 
but it is not a law of spiritual growth. He who lets selfishness and his 
passions rule him binds his soul in slavery, but he who, in the majesty of 
spiritual strength, uses his physical tendencies and yearnings, and his pos- 
sessions to serve purposes higher than personal indulgence and comf ort, 
takes the first step toward the happy and useful life. This truth was taught 
not only "in the Beginning" when the Gospel was first revealed to man, 
but also when the Savior began His earthly ministry. On the Mount of 
Temptation was enacted the first scene in the Christ's earthly drama of 
the abundant life. There He resisted the challenge to gratify His 
appetite ; He turned aside the appeal to His vanity and pride ; He scorned 
the bribe of worldly wealth and power, as in spiritual victory He said to 
the Tempter, "Get thee hence," and "angels came and ministered unto 
Him." Only thus by the brilliant triumph of the spirit over the flesh can 
we hope for a better world. 

UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION 

Finally, if we would make the world better, let us foster a keener 
appreciation of the freedom and liberty guaranteed by the government 
of the United States as framed by the founders of this nation. Here 
again self -proclaimed progressives cry that such old-time adherence is out 
of date. But there are some fundamental principles of this Republic 
which, like eternal truths, never get out of date, and which are applicable 
at all times to liberty-loving peoples. Such are the underlying principles 
of the Constitution, a document framed by patriotic, freedom-loving men, 
who Latter-day Saints declare were inspired by the Lord. 

This date, October 6, has been set apart by churches as "Loyalty 
Day." It is highly fitting, therefore, as a means of making the world 
better, not only to urge loyalty to the Constitution and to threatened 
fundamentals of the United States government, but to warn the people 
that there is evidence in the United States of disloyalty to tried and true 
fundamentals in government. There are unsound economic theories ; 
there are European "isms," which, termite like, secretly and, recently, 
quite openly and defiantly, are threatening to undermine our democratic 
institutions. 

Today, as never before, the issue is clearly defined — liberty and 
freedom of choice, or oppression and subjugation for the individual and 
for nations. 

As we contemplate the deplorable fact that within the brief space 
of one year, TEN European nations have lost their independence, that 
over TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION people have sur- 
rendered all guarantees of personal liberty, deeper should be our grati- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



tude, more intense our appreciation of the Constitution, and more 
strengthened our determination to resist at all costs any and all attempts 
to curtail our liberties, or to change the underlying system of our govern- 
ment. , , ,. .' . ; , 

CONCLUSION 

When the people who call themselves Christian militantly enlist 
under the leadership of the One to whom they refer as King of the 
World; when they accept as facts and not as theories His moral and 
spiritual teachings; when for selfishness they substitute kindness and 
thoughtf ulness for others ; when they aggressively defend the principles 
of true liberty, then may we begin to realize the hope that Wrong may 
be abolished, Righteousness be enthroned in human hearts, and honest 
relations and justice become the daily practice of society. Then, and 
not until then, will the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of 
our God. 

Then shall all shackles fall ; the stormy clangor 
Of wild war music o'er the earth shall cease ; 
Love shall tread out the baleful fire of anger, 
And in its ashes plant the tree of peace ! 

The Tabernacle Choir sang, "To Thee O Lord Do I Lift Up My 
Soul," by Kalinnikoff, and "Doxology." 

J. Spencer Cornwall led the singing, Alexander Schreiner was at the 
organ, and the program was announced by Richard L. Evans.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We have all been edified, instructed, and built up by President 
McKay's great address. 

Our next speaker will be Elder George Albert Smith of the Council 
of the Twelve. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

No normal man, having partaken of the inspiration that we have 
enjoyed this morning while singing the praises of our Heavenly Father 
and listening to the addresses of the brethren, could stand in the presence 
of an audience like this without realizing his need for divine guidance. 
I would not undertake this responsibility if I did not believe that the 
Lord would help me in what I may say. 

This is the 222nd Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat- 
ter-day Saints. Each one preceding it has been favored by the Lord in

that he has fulfilled his promise to his sons and daughters who were 
assembled in worship, that he would be with them to bless them, and he 
is fulfilling that promise today. 

SABBATH OBSERVANCE UPLIFTING 

This is the Lord's day, an appropriate time for us to meet together 
in His name, for He has commanded that we should assemble on the 
Sabbath to pay our devotions to the Most High. I know of no more 
beautiful spot in all the world than this in which- people are permitted to 
worship. I avail myself of the opportunity to thank those who look after 
this block, particularly Brother Nauman, the good man who has devoted 
much of his life to making Temple Square delightful to all visitors. The 
flowers that have adorned the stand during this conference are his 
contribution to our happiness in this sanctuary and I know of no place 
where flowers are more appropriate than in the House of the Lord. 

What an uplift would come to the world if all of our Father's chil- 
dren on this, the Sabbath day, instead of warring on one another were 
seeking Him in worship and humbly praying for His all-wise guidance 
in conducting their lives. With that attitude among men war would cease, 
but if men continue to refuse to obey the counsels of the Master of 
heaven and earth destruction will increase until civilization may disappear 
from the earth. 

PROPHETS HAVE RAISED A WARNING VOICE 

The Lord has warned us of our danger and advised how to escape it. 
Amos, the prophet, said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He 
revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets." Many prophecies 
are already fulfilled and others will be in the near future. 

Centuries have passed since our first parents began their mortal 
existence and were advised by the Lord how to obtain happiness. For 
hundreds of years we have had His instruction through His prophets 
recorded as scripture so that we could know what He had desired of us. 
Isn't it strange that after centuries of opportunity to know the truth as 
taught by the Father of all a majoriy of the people of this world do not 
believe it or accept him as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. That 
they do not accept His teachings is evident that they do not believe in 
Him, and it is disappointing that in the year 1940 in our own land there 
are many who fail to realize that God is our Heavenly Father. 

Men cannot justify their delinquencies before the great Judge by 
declaring that they have not had the opportunity to know, for all down 
through the ages prophets of the Lord have been teaching what He desires 
us to know, and in our own day and age opportunity unparalleled in the 
history of the world has been offered to the children of men to know that 
there is a God and that we are His children. Here we are in worship 
enjoying the peace and the inspiration of our Heavenly Father with the 
assurance that He can hear and answer our prayers. Yet in some parts 
of the earth today there are multitudes who are seeking to destroy one 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



107 



another. They have no desire to worship God or accept His advice. They 
prefer to have their own wrong way and be wilful in having it. 

The Holy Bible is a most wonderful record and if there ever was 
a time when we should know what it contains it is now. Many would 
be surprised if they would read it, to discover that some of the predictions 
that were made by the servants of the Lord thousands of years ago are 
now in course of fulfilment. It would astonish some people to know that 
the Prophet Isaiah, seven hundred years before the birth of Christ, 
predicted His coming. Two hundred years before the fall of Babylon he 
predicted its destruction, and told in remarkable detail what would follow 
even down to this day. He said (Isaiah 13 :19-22) : 

And Babylon, the glory of Kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' 
excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from genera- 
tion to generation ; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall 
the shepherds make their fold there. 

But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall 
be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall 
dance there. 

And the wild beast of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, 
and dragons in their pleasant palaces ; and her time is near to come, and her 
days shall not be prolonged. 

' If the Lord had not revealed it to him Isaiah could not have known 
these things. We today are witnesses that that promise is still in effect, 
notwithstanding that when the prophecy was uttered Babylon was the 
greatest city in all the world, the wealthiest and the most powerful of all 
kingdoms, and was governed by the greatest of all earthly kings. 

Sometimes we forget that the Lord has spoken and we fail to inform 
ourselves to His decrees. Read the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel 
with reference to Tyre, or the strong city, and how they were fulfilled and 
the city overthrown. The ruins are still visible in the bottom of the sea, 
and the original site is a barren rock. 

The dream of Nebuchadnezzar about the great image, interpreted 
by Daniel more than two thousand years ago, was still in process of ful- 
fillment when the Church of Jesus Christ was organized in 1830. 

Read in Joshua, Chapter 6, of the threat against the man who dared 
to rebuild the city of Jericho and its remarkable fulfillment when Hiel 
after hundreds of years, disregarding Joshua's warning, lost his two 
sons when he laid the foundations and set up the gates of the city. 

The scriptures are replete with the prophecies of the servants of 
God that are fulfilled. They were humble men such as are here in this 
house today ; but under the inspiration of our Heavenly Father the heav- 
ens were opened to them, the future was revealed and they predicted with 
certainty what should occur. They could foretell the future but it re- 
quired the Master of heaven and earth, our Heavenly Father, to fulfill 
their promises. 

A PROPHECY FULFILLED IN LATTER DAYS 

We find one promise was made that particularly points to us. I refer 
to that of Micah when he said: (Micah 4:1-2) 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

The mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top 
of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills ; and people shall 
flow unto it. 

And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to 
the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he 
will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths ; for the law shall 
go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

Can you think of any place but this to which the people of the various 
nations of the earth have been gathered in fulfillment of this prediction? 
Micah did not know of himself that God would establish this Church ; he 
did not know that another prophet would come and predict things with 
reference to this time ; no man could know. But the Father who knoweth 
all things revealed it to him ; he predicted it, it was recorded and the chil- 
dren of men are fulfilling the prediction. 

Dozen of passages in the scriptures could be cited as evidence that 
our Heavenly Father in mercy and kindness has been talking to the chil- 
of men all down through the ages, not only telling them what would occur, 
but pleading with them to turn from the error of their ways lest destruc- 
tion should overtake them. 

The destruction of Jerusalem was foretold by Jeremiah, a prophet 
of the Lord, and his prediction fulfilled to the very letter. The scattering 
of Judah was predicted by the Prophet Ezekiel hundreds of years before 
it occurred and Judah is still scattered. Isaiah named the man who should 
rebuild Jerusalem a hundred years before he was born. How did that 
prophet know that his name would be Cyrus if the Lord did not reveal 
it unto him ? 

PROMISES MADE REGARDING AMERICAN CONTINENT 

In the Book of Mormon, "The American volume of scripture," the 
Lord has given to us information pertaining to this land upon which 
we dwell and called it a land favored above all other lands. I recommend 
that not only you Latter-day Saints read the Book of Mormon, but that 
our Father's other children read it. They will find that it contains, in 
addition to what the Bible has told us about the world, what the Lord 
has said about this Western Hemisphere — that this should be a land of 
liberty unto the Gentiles and that no king should dwell upon this land, but 
that He, the God of Heaven, would be our King and would fortify this 
land against all the nations, that this should be a land of peace and happi- 
ness, on condition that we would honor the God of this earth, the Father 
of us all. The factor controlling this promise is that we must keep the 
commandments of our Heavenly Father or it cannot be realized. 

MODERN PROPHECIES 

In our day the Prophet Joseph Smith has spoken. Through him 
there have been given to the world many things that are important, many 
revelations that later were fulfilled. 

Nearly thirty years before the Civil War commenced in our country 
he predicted that it would occur and that it would begin in South Carolina. 
How did Joseph Smith know that if God did not reveal it to him? How 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



109 



could he pick out the very place that it should begin ? I think it would 
be desirable to read what the Lord said at that time, December 25, 1832. 
Doctrine and Covenants, Section 87 : 

Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come 
to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually 
terminate in the death and misery of many souls ; 

And the time will come when war will be poured out upon all nations, 
beginning at this place. * * * 

With the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall 
mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of 
heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of the 
earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an 
Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all 
nations. 

Just as in the centuries that are past when the Lord spoke through 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and his other prophets he has spoken in our 
day through His prophet, Joseph Smith. When the Church was still build- 
ing the beautiful city of Nauvoo, Illinois, he predicted that the Latter-day 
Saints would he driven from their homes, that they would find a place 
in the tops of the Rocky Mountains, and that they would become a mighty 
people in the midst thereof. How did he know? He knew by the same 
power that Isaiah and the Prophets of old knew with reference to the 
things , they predicted. 

Read the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants that inform us 
how we may escape the calamities that are to cover the earth and afflict 
all mankind. We are better than other people only as we live better. We 
have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The responsibility of disseminating it 
among the children of men has been magnificently performed in all parts 
of the world by more than 60,000 of the sons and daughters of the living 
God. To the ends of the earth from this sacred building have been broad- 
cast by radio songs of praise, accompanied by the great organ sermons 
of truth, expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving intended for the 
blessing of all mankind. We meet today in this great Tabernacle built 
during the poverty of the people and dedicated to the Lord, the father of 
our spirits, and while we have been sitting here the voice of one of his 
faithful servants has gone out not only to all parts of our nation but to the 
islands of the sea and other distant lands. 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHURCH MEMBERS 

Our Heavenly Father, through His faithful representatives, has told 
us of the important things that should occur and we can read about them 
in His holy scriptures. If we really desire to be saved and exalted in His 
celestial kingdom He has told us how to proceed and has warned us that 
we must discharge the obligations entitling us to that exaltation. While 
we enjoy this blessing it carries with it a tremendous responsibility. Every 
man and every woman under the sound of my voice who has accepted the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, who has gone down into the waters of baptism 
and been confirmed a member of His Church should so live that others 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Dag 

seeing their upright lives may be constrained to accept the Gospel of our 
Lord and prepare to become faithful sons and daughters. 

Now in conclusion, let me say that God lives, I know that the Bible 
contains His holy word. I know that the Book of Mormon is a history 
of the ancestors of the American Indians and tells of God's hand-dealings 
with His children here in America in an early day. I know that the 
Doctrine and Covenants contains the promises of our Heavenly Father 
to the children of men — wonderful promises that can only be realized by 
us if we make ourselves worthy of them by living correct lives. Let us 
who have accepted the Gospel of our Lord evidence our knowledge of its 
truth, let us demonstrate our assurance of its power and set such an 
example before all the world that our Father's other children, whom he 
loves as much as he loves us, may desire not only to search the old scrip- 
tures but to read the new scriptures and listen to the voice of His servants 
who today are in different parts of the world calling all men to repentance, 
with the promise that if they will repent and receive the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ as revealed by Him in former days and in this latter-day, all — not 
just a few — but all may be exalted in His celestial kingdom and obtain 
glory, immortality and eternal life. That we may be worthy of our 
heritage, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 

Acting President, European Missions 

My brethren and sisters, I am very pleased and thankful to report 
that in spite of the unsettled and rapidly changing conditions in Europe, 
our Missions are functioning almost as usual, in the hands of local people. 
All headquarters, with the exception of one, are maintained. That one 
exception is the French Mission. The headquarters at Paris have been 
closed temporarily, but Brother Gaston Chappuis, who has just returned 
from Paris with his wife, received permission just before leaving to visit 
Belgium, and he reports that the work there in that part of the French 
Mission is well organized ; and before we left Switzerland this spring, the 
other part of the French Mission in Switzerland was placed in the hands 
of a very capable brother, and the French-Swiss district is also progess- 
ing nicely. 

As I stated, all other Missions are well organized. We receive letters 
quite regularly. We have asked for at least a letter a month. These letters, 
of course, are censored, and the brethren cannot report about other than 
Church affairs — nothing political. On all the mail from continental 
Europe we find stamped upon the envelope the word "Geoffnet," or 
"Gepruft," the German word for censored ; and the letters coming from 
Great Britain are stamped in large letters, "Opened." 

All the Missions report that Sunday Schools, Relief Societies, sacra- 
ment and Priesthood meetings, as well as branch and district conferences 
are being held as usual ; and nearly all of the Missions report baptisms. 
In a letter received last week from one of the Missions, they reported 



ELDER THOMAS E. McKAY 



111 



fifty-five baptisms for the first eight months of this year. Three of the 
Missions have' reported an increase in tithing and Fast offerings, as com- 
pared with the same period last year. 

We are very happy, too, and thankful to report that in those coun- 
tries that have been invaded not one of our members, whether a soldier 
or lay member, has lost his life or been injured. In Norway, and also in 
Holland and Belgium, a number of our members lost their homes and 
everything of an earthly nature that they had, but their lives were spared. 
One brother is reported missing in the British Mission, but it is hoped 
that he is in Switzerland. 

In a letter just received from our brother in charge of the French- 
Swiss district, in expressing his appreciation for a few extra 
Eras that we had sent him — he was very honest — said : "I am receiving 
the Era already from Brother Ursenbach," (a former Mission Presi- 
dent), "but I am very glad to get these extra numbers, President McKay, 
because we send them out to the Tommies who are interned here." Until 
that time we had not realized that some of our British soldiers were 
interned in Switzerland. Once in a while a little political news creeps 
through. 

We are pleased also to report that in Great Britain all members 
of our Church holding the Medchizedek Priesthood have been excused 
from army service, so as to take care of their Church work. The follow- 
ing is a copy of a letter to Brother Andre K. Anastasiou, acting President 
of the British Mission regarding this matter : 

Sir: 

I am directed by the Minister of Labour and National Service to refer 
to your recent meeting with an officer of this department and your letter of 
22nd July regarding the position under the National Service (Armed Forces) 
Acts of men in Holy Orders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

In reply, I am to state that it has now been decided that men in the 
major Orders may be regarded as covered by the provisions of Section 
11 (1) (e) of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 193.9. Such 
men are not, therefore, liable to be called up for service under that Act 
and they are not required to register when other men of their age class 
are called upon to do so. 

As regards the list which you submitted with your letter of 22nd July, I 
am to state that all the men referred to therein will be regarded as covered 
by the statutory exception conferred upon men in Holy Orders except the 
two Priests named. 

I am, Sir, * • " 
Your obedient Servant

Now brethren and sisters, in conclusion may I express my heartfelt 
appreciation for the opportunity that has been given to me to continue, 
although rather remotely, in contact with these brethren and sisters in 
war-torn Europe. For nine years I had the privilege of associating with 
those people, and, brethren and sisters, they are good people. They love

the Gospel ; they are finding in very deed that the Gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation. It is a great comfort to them. They write : "We 
are all right ; we have the Gospel." 

May I commend to you, brethren and sisters, in concluding, the beau- 
tiful remarks of President Grant at the opening of this session, permeated 
with tolerance and love ; also the message of the First Presidency read 
at the opening of the first session of our Conference. Read that, and 
re-read it. Tolerance and love permeated every sentence. 

Who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul 
May keep the path, but will not find the goal; 
While he who walks in love may wander far, 
But God will bring him where the righteous are. 

God help us to walk in love, to keep His commandments, that we 
may enjoy true happiness here in this life, as well as in the life to come, I 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

The Lord moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform. I 
know that all of our hearts rejoice in the report which President Mc- 
Kay has been able to make. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang, "Alleluia," by Mozart. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder George H. Robinson, Presi- 
dent of the Bear Lake Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 :00 p. m. 

THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened Sunday, Oc- 
tober 6, at 2 p. m. 

Once more the Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, and again the 
large Assembly Hall was filled with listeners, and thousands of others 
congregated on the Tabernacle Square, where, by means of amplifiers, 
they listened to the Conference proceedings as given in the Tabernacle. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

We are again happy that President Grant is present and presiding. 
He has asked me to take charge of the meeting. 

This afternoon the music will be by the Tabernacle Choir, under 
the direction of J. Spencer Cornwall. Dr. Frank W. Asper at the organ. 

The choir. and congregation sang, "Come, Come, Ye Saints." 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 1 1 3 

The opening prayer was offered by President Thomas E. Towler, of 
the Wells Stake. 

The Choir sang "Lamb of God" (Haydn). 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

And again this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the 
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come, or 
the destruction of the wicked. 

THE CALL TO REPENTANCE 

These words were spoken by our Savior to His disciples shortly 
before his crucifixion. They have reference to the day in which we 
live. In fulfilment of -that prediction the Elders of this Church have 
been preaching the Gospel in the nations of the earth for one hundred 
and ten years, they have been raising the warning voice and crying 
repentance. It was not only expedient, but it was inspirational that the 
Presidency of this Church, at the opening of this Conference should 
send forth a petition or an epistle not only to the Latter-day Saints, but to 
the people of the earth, calling them to repentance and giving unto them 
a warning. 

From the very beginning the Lord has called upon the Elders of the 
Church to raise the warning voice, and we read : 

Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of Him who 
dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: 
Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the 
sea, listen together. 

That is the call from the Lord to every soul upon the face of the 
earth, to give heed to His warning. Then continuing He says : 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not 
hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow ; for their 
iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall 
be revealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of 
my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord 
have commanded them. 

And so they have gone forth, bearing witness of the restoration 
of the Gospel, preaching repentance, warning the people of the calamities 
that were to follow their preaching. 

A WARNING TO THE WORLD 

Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have 
decreed in them — (that is, in the Elders) — shall be fulfilled. 

And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these 
tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal 
both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious ; 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 6 Third Day 

Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall 
be poured out upon the wicked without measure — 

Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every 
man according to his work, and measure to every man according to 
the measure which he has measured to his fellow man. 

Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that 
all that will hear may hear : 

Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh. 
Then again the Lord gave this instruction : 

Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come 
upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, 
Jr., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments ; 

And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets — 

The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the 
mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, 
neither trust in the arm of flesh — ■ 

But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, 
even the Savior of the world; 

That faith also might increase in the earth; 

That mine everlasting covenant might be established ; 

That the fulness of my Gospel might be proclaimed by the weak 
and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

That proclamation was given in the very beginning of this Church ; 
it is found in the Preface which the Lord Himself wrote to this book of 
commandments. 

Further, again the Lord says : 

For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know 
that the day speedily cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 
peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power of his 
own dominion. 

And also the Lord shall have power over His saints, and shall reign 
in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the 
world. 

That was said more than a hundred years ago. Peace has been 
taken from the world, the devil does have power over his own dominion 
today, and the Lord has not yet come to dwell with His Saints, but that 
also shall be fulfilled. 

THE JUDGMENTS TO COME 

Let me present another petition to the nations of the earth and to 
the Elders of the Church: 

Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand. 

For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven ; 
the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of 
God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations : 
Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again. 

Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked. 

Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, 
both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves 
for the great day of the Lord ; 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 115 



For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to 
repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the 
thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking 
to the ears of all that live, saying — Repent, and prepare for the great 
day of the Lord? 

Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east 
unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and 
make the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words — Repent ye, 
for the great day of the Lord is come? 

And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: 
Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who 
made you. 

O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you to- 
gether as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would 
not! 

How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and 
by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of 
thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, 
and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice 
of f amines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, 
and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, 
and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and 
would have saved you with an everlasting- salvation, but ye would not ! 

Behold the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation 
is full. 

Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord 
your God. 

Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time — for the 
last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

THE WORD OF THE LORD TO THE MISSIONARIES 

Again speaking to the missionaries in an early day the Lord said : 

Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh 
every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor. 

Therefore, they are left without excuse, and their sins are upon their 
own heads. 

He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken. 

Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that you may be perfected 
in your ministry to go forth among the Gentiles for the last time, as many 
as the mouth of the Lord shall name, to bind up the law and seal up the 
testimony, and to prepare the saints for the hour of judgment which'is to 
come : 

That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abom- 
ination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to 
come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first Elders continue 
in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time 
is not yet come ; their garments are not clean from the blood of this gen- 
eration. 

Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free ; entangle not your- 
selves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord comes. 

For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and 
fro as a drunken man ; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to 
give light ; and the moon shall be bathed in blood ; and the stars shall become 
exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that f alleth from 
off a fig-tree. 

And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the 
people. 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that 
shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the 
ground and shall not be able to stand. 

And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the 
voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves 
of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 

And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall 
fail them; for fear shall come upon all people. 

And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud 
voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O 
inhabitants of the earth ; for the judgment of our God is come. Behold, 
and lo, the Bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet Him. 

These are the words of the Lord to His servants, and to the nations 
of the earth. As I look into your faces I see before me hundreds, 
thousands, who have been gathered out from the nations of the earth, 
either you or your parents, but you heard the Gospel in foreign lands. In 
obedience to this call you are here today. Nations have refused to hear 
the testimony of the Elders of Israel as it has been proclaimed, and the 
Lord has withdrawn them from among the nations, that is, many of 
them. He has done that because they have rejected the truth, and because 
of their wickedness. War comes because of wickedness ; it never comes 
because of righteousness, but through the violation of the laws of God. 

THE WORD OF THE LORD HAS GONE FORTH 

Now, the Lord has predicted all these things. We have known 
this ; it has been taught to us for a hundred years. We have been in- 
formed that it is necessary to keep the commandments of the Lord, for 
us to repent of our sins, for us to walk in ways of righteousness, and do 
the thing that the Lord would have us do. The nations have had procla- 
mations made to them from time to time. In the early days of this 
Church it was very customary for the Presidency of the Church to send 
forth a proclamation, not only to the Saints, but to the inhabitants of 
the earth, calling upon them to repent, to turn from their ways of wicked- 
ness to ways of righteousness, accepting the fulness of the Gospel as it 
has been revealed. 

It is nothing new — should not be — to us to see these calamities and 
these destructions taking place upon the face of the earth. We have been 
warned; the Authorities of the Church have spoken from the very 
beginning calling attention to these things. We have seen and we have 
read in the records the Lord has given us, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
the Book of Mormon, and the Pearl of Great Price, that all these things 
were due to come in the dispensation of the fulness of time. 

Now let me read this other scripture : 

Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is 
Zion— THE PURE IN HEART; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the 
wicked shall mourn. 

For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly as 
the whirlwind ; and who shall escape it ? 

The Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report 
thereof shall vex all people ; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come ; 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



117 



For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations 
and all their wicked works. 

Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatso- 
ever I have commanded her. 

But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will 
visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, 
with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire. 

THE WAY OF ESCAPE 

Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have 
accepted of her offering ; and if she sin no more none of these things shall 
come upon her. 

We have the means of escape through obedience to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Will we escape ? When I see, even among the Latter-day 
Saints the violation of the laws of the Lord, I fear and I tremble. I 
have been crying repentance among the Stakes of Zion for thirty years, 
calling upon the people to turn to the Lord, keep His commandments, 
observe the Sabbath Day, pay their honest tithing, do everything the Lord 
has commanded them to do, to live by every word that proceedeth forth 
from the mouth of God. 

By doing this we shall escape the calamities. 

I am going to repeat what I have said before, for which I have 
been severely criticized from certain quarters, that even in this country 
we have no grounds by which we may escape, no> sure foundation upon 
which we can stand, and by which we may escape from the calamities and 
destruction and the plagues and the pestilences, and even the devouring 
fire by sword and by war, unless we repent and keep the commandments 
of the Lord, for it is written here in these revelations. 

So I cry repentance to the Latter-day Saints, and I cry repentance 
to the people of the United States, as well as to the people of all the 
earth. May we turn to live in accordance with divine law, and keep 
the commandments the Lord has given, I humbly pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the TvOelve Apostles 
The blessed Savior said : 

Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in 
me. John 14:1. 

Again 

For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with 
all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a 
thousand years, and the wicked shall not stand. 

(Doctrine & Covenants Section 29 :11.) 

BLESSINGS TO FOLLOW JUDGMENTS 

The earth, in spite of these dark, gloomy days, is moving forward to 
a glorious ideal. The good that seems imprisoned is working toward 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

deliverance and triumph. "We believe that Christ will reign personally 
upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its para- 
disaical glory." 

The judgments that are raging in the earth are testimonies to the 
Latter-day Saints that God's blessings will follow, for He loves mercy 
more than judgment. 

STRENUOUS WORK NEEDED 

If Paul were to return to the earth now would he say to the Ameri- 
can people what he said to the people of his day ? 

The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 

I think that America stands in need of the gospel of strenuous work. 
We are becoming a soft people ; we like our nights of pleasure and our 
days of loafing. There would not be nearly so much sin in the world 
today if men and women would work more and play less. It is becoming 
a practice to talk much of our rights. These rights of course are sacred ; 
they are God-given, but if we neglect to use them they become a curse, 
as it were, and God will take them away. 

Why not talk more about obligations to man, to country, and to God ? 
We are under deep obligation to care for our fellow-creatures. Think 
of this wonderful truth in the Book of Mormon : 

When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the 
service of your God. 

god's purposes to be fulfilled 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the mother of 
men because it has given so much. This heaven-inspired Church Welfare 
Plan creates in us a fine desire to be sympathetic and to work, and to help 
others to work. The joy that we gain from service to men is not easily 
measured. 

Wars may come, and they will go. I do not believe the Millennium 
is imminent; this Church is consecrated to the task of preaching the 
Gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. We have scarcely 
scratched the surface. Where we are baptizing one today, in the not 
distant future we are going to baptize fifty, aye, a hundred, for God's 
purposes are sure to be fulfillled. He does not delight in the death of 
the wicked. He loves His children and through His servants, He is 
pleading with them to come to the light, which results in obedience to Him. 

ETERNAL RICHES REMAIN 

The days are dark ; we suffer temptation, we suffer hardships of 
various kinds, but there is one thing that depression and war cannot take 
from us. I refer to the gift of eternal life. We should put more trust in 
the spiritual values of existence. The things which are seen are temporal ; 
but the things which are not seen are eternal. Wars may rage, famine 
may come, earthquakes and the like, and depressions, but these things 
cannot take away the eternal riches of Jesus Christ. Some of these riches 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



119 



are the glorous atonement, salvation for the dead, the second coming of 
the Son of God, the glorious resurrection and the eternity of the marriage 
covenant by which we are united in marriage on earth and in heaven by 
the power of the holy Priesthood. Thieves and misfortune cannot take 
these things from us, for they are immortal, God-given, and shall survive 
death and destruction. The Apostle Paul sings this glorious refrain of 
gratitude : 

It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at 
the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 

THE LOVE OF THE SAVIOR 

What a wonderful thing it is to have a mediator, the Lord Jesus, 
who intercedes for his brethren. 
And Paul continues: 

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or 
distress, or persecution, or famine or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 

* * * * 

Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that 
loved us. 

For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor 
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 

Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate 
us from the love of God, which is in Christ our Lord. (Romans 8:34-39). 

For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to 
be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. (Romans 8:18). 

Ere long the skies will rend and Jesus Christ shall descend in glory 
with all his holy angels. Then will begin the long foretold Millennium, for 
which women have wept and for which men have prayed. Christ shall 
reign upon the earth in glory and in power from the rivers to the end of 
the earth. In that glorious Millennium we shall have good government, 
freedom from corruption; we shall rejoice in the divine reign of Him 
who is Prince of Peace and King of Kings. 

When He comes 

He will rule the world with truth and grace, 
And make the nations prove 
The glories of His righteousness 
And wonders of His love. 

Even so, blessed Lord Jesus, come quickly. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am delighted, my brethren and sisters and friends, to greet you 
upon this occasion, and to feel the impressions of the holy Spirit of God 
that have been manifest all through this great Conference. It is always 
an inspiration to see the large congregations of the Church gathered 
together as we see them during the periods of our Annual and Semi- 
Annual Conferences — people who have come from great distances, people 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

who have in their hearts the testimony of Jesus, who are led to do the 
things they know are right, and who desire to walk in the path of God. 

EVIDENCES OF A MARVELOUS WORK IN THE EARTH 

This is an evidence of the marvelous work and wonder that our 
Eternal Father is performing in the earth. He has gathered out from 
among the nations the progenitors of those who are here in the Church 
at the present time ; and those who are here have accomplished the things 
that He intended. But the power of the adversary has been so violent 
that it has curtailed free agency among the children of men. I say unto 
you, my dear brethren and sisters, that the free agency of men is limited ; 
there are not many peoples in the earth today who enjoy such freedom 
as can be enjoyed in a great democracy like this. Our Eternal Father has 
established this country for the work that He has designated to take 
place in these latter days. 

MESSAGE TO BE TAKEN FROM PRIESTHOOD MEETINGS 

When I looked upon the congregation of men last night in the 
Priesthood meeting I was deeply impressed. I saw in the faces of those 
men a firm determination, a resolution to carry out the plan of God. It 
will be but a few hours before they go back into their fields of labor in 
all the Stakes of Zion, and there they will teach the Gospel to the children 
of men, and testify to those who belong to the Church that this was and 
is the Church of Christ our Lord. They will admonish them that the 
time has come for men to measure up. They will encourage them to 
gather out from among the communities where they live those who might 
receive the truth. How many of us know our neighbors How many of 
us think about the men or the women who may be living near us, who are 
not members of the Church? I take it that this great body of Priesthood 
is concerned about these, our brothers and sisters, and that their desire 
is to carry to them the Gospel message. 

OUR DUTY TO THOSE WHO COME HERE TO LIVE 

There are many people who come into the Stakes of Zion who do 
not really know why they come here, take up their abode and live among 
us. But we may well believe that they have been directed here for the 
purpose of baptism, for the purpose of hearing the voice of their Redeem- 
er. We pray constantly for our missionaries who go abroad, that they 
may search out the honest in heart, but we little think about those in our 
midst who have been moved upon by the spirit and power of God to come 
into this land where they may receive the blessings that are theirs by 
right. For in the great plan of our Eternal Father, established before the 
foundations of this earth were laid, all men who would believe, all who 
would be valiant for the testimony of Jesus, were given the opportunity 
to hear the truth. It was ordained that they should be made partakers 
of these great blessings- — the blessings that were to be theirs here and 
in eternity. Of such are the congregations of the Latter-day Saints 
composed. 



ELDER RUDGER CLAW SON

But there are thousands of men yet to hear the Gospel, there are 
thousands of women who might be turned into the channels of real 
service for which there is such an abundance of opportunity, under 
the leadership of the women's organizations of the Church. There is 
a great work for us to do, and there is no time for us to wait, for this 
is the work of God, this is the great day which our Eternal Father de- 
clared through His holy prophets, centuries ago, He would establish in 
the last days. This Church is never more to be thrown down or given 
to another people. This is the day of salvation. We invite the children 
of men everywhere to investigate the doctrines we believe. I invite my 
friends who may be listening in to take time to read the doctrines of the 
Church, to read the things that the Lord has revealed, and become 
acquainted with them. Let me repeat that there are many fine men and 
women in this world, many of whom live within our gates, who might be- 
come members of the Church, if they could be made to see the great plan 
of our Redeemer. It is our responsibility and privilege to carry this 
message to them. 

A TESTIMONY OF THE TRUTH 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I know that this is the work of God. 
There is no doubt in my mind that the Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith was the prophet whom the 
Lord selected before the foundations of this earth were laid, to bring 
about His righteous purposes in your day and mine. That great plan of 
God shall continue as long as the earth shall stand. And it will be carried 
to the children of men through the guiding leadership of the Holy Ghost. 

A great miracle has taken place among us. Our Father's prophet, 
our leader, the man that we love, has been partially restored to health 
and is able to be here and speak with power and influence. May we 
sustain him, may we sustain each other, sustain the things the Lord has 
revealed to us, that His work may become stronger, and that His plans 
may be carried out as He would desire them to be, I pray in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

President of the Council of the Twelve 

My brethren and sisters: You see here on the pulpit a movable 
platform that can be raised up and let down to suit the speaker. It is not 
a Republican platform; it is not a Democratic platform; (Laughter) 
it is a Church platform and I can hardly reach up to it. (Laughter) 

AN INSPIRING CONFERENCE 

Brethren and sisters, I feel that it is a high honor to be asked to 
stand here and address this wonderful congregation of Latter-day Saints. 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October b Third Day 

This is a marvelous attendance, a marvelous work and a wonder, to 
have a building here that will accommodate between 8000 and 9000 
people. "That was the attendance last night at the General Priesthood 
meeting. It was a very inspirational and instructive meeting as were all 
the meetings of the Conference. And haven't we had a wonderful day 
today? Think of the beautiful music that is furnished by the Tabernacle 
Qioir. Their voices go out to all the country around, to all the world, 
as it were, and yet they remain with us. The Choir is entitled to great 
credit for the wonderful work it is doing. 

I am sure, my brethren and sisters, that you feel as I do, that we 
are very happy indeed to have the President of the Church, who has been 
ill, with us on this occasion and at this Conference. It is fitting that he 
should be here, and we could not be fully satisfied without him. But he 
is here. He is looking pretty well and he feels well. I heard him say 
that he is feeling fine. 

Now there is hardly anything lacking, but if there is one thing 
above another that I would like it would be the gift of eloquence to 
express myself before this congregation. You know some of the brethren 
of the Twelve, if not all of them, except myself, have the gift of elo- 
quence ; and it helps to stir up the congregation, and it is restful to have 
a little eloquence punctuate one's remarks when speaking. 

Let me tell you at this point that I forgot to look at the time when 
I came to the pulpit so I shall ask President Clark, when I have talked 
about twenty minutes, to let me know without your knowing it. (Laugh- 
ter) 

THE GOSPEL FURNISHES TEXTS 

Permit me to say this : There is a wealth of material in the standard 
Church works sufficient to furnish texts for our brethren who speak 
from the pulpit, and also the sisters when they speak. I think we should 
be pretty careful in our religious gatherings to preach the Gospel. That's 
the important thing. Lectures, in many instances, are very fine aids 
in their place, and there is a place for them — particularly scientific 
lectures and historical talks. The Lord has intimated that we ought 
to read good books and become acquainted with the things of the world, 
but in our special gatherings of the Saints we ought to be sure to preach 
the Gospel. It is an elaborate subject, it is very comprehensive. The 
Gospel covers a wide range, and the principles of the Gospel are most 
important, and therefore I am to tell you right now that I would like 
to say a few words upon two great movements in the Church. 

TEMPLE WORK FOR THE DEAD 

One is the missionary movement which was mentioned by Brother 
Joseph Fielding Smith in his talk. That is one of the subjects that I 
wanted to bring before you, and the other subject is the work for the 
dead. These are two highly important subjects, because we are under 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 



123 



injunction of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith to look after 
the matter pertaining to the dead. The living can take care of themselves 
if they will, the opportunity is before them. We have the temple and 
they can go into it and get their endowments, their blessings and sealings 
but the dead cannot do that. I am speaking now of our ancestors in the 
spirit world, because every man here has a line of ancestors behind him, 
and every woman here has a line of ancestors and it is our business 
to look up our ancestors and get what information we can. 

Now upon my mother's side we have done a very good work because 
we have had the names to do it, but on my father's side we have been 
stopped because of a break in the line somewhere, and we have not until 
lately been able to get back very far. The names we did get we have 
done the work for and that is very fortunate. I hope the Lord will open 
up the way and give us some more names. I would say to you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, do not forget your dead, because you owe them this 
much effort to do something for them. They lived in a day when the 
Gospel was not upon the earth ; they certainly have a claim upon us and 
I am prompted to say that if we refuse to recognize our obligation to do 
the work for our dead the Lord will reject us as a Church, because you 
know that souls are very precious unto him and we cannot afford to 
neglect this matter. 

With some people it is difficult to get to the temple because they live 
some distance away, but they should make an extra effort to do so, and 
some people living very near to the temple have not done their work for 
the dead, and yet they have means but they have overlooked it. We 
cannot afford to go to sleep over this matter. 

Perhaps my time is up, but I have not heard from President Clark 
yet. (Laughter) A person sometimes gets more interested in his own 
talk than does the congregation. (Laughter) So we have to ask the man 
in charge to notify us when to stop. I am rather glad it is that way 
because if we did not feel an interest in what we were saying ourselves, 
who would feel an interest in it? (Laughter) 

MISSIONARY PREPARATION 

I am very much interested in the missionary work that has been 
going on in our Church for a hundred years. It is brought down to a 
fine point because one of the Presidency of the Church, Brother David 
O. McKay, has a hand in it. A committee looks after the groups of 
missionaries who come up to Zion for a little training; they have to 
have a little teaching before they can go out and preach the Gospel. They 
ought to have a good deal, but they will get some experience in the mission 
field. It is wonderful what the Lord can do with these young men who 
are going out; and mark you, these young men who are going out as 
missionaries could not do very effective work without divine authority, 
so they come up here and get it. They go to the Temple and get the 
Temple blessings, and they go into the study room and listen to lectures 
on the Gospel, after which the hands of the Council of the Twelve 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



Apostles and First Council of Seventy are laid on their heads conferring 
the authority to preach the Gospel. The result is that there are hundreds 
of thousands of people in the spirit world who benefit from the work 
of these young men. 



I think I might have time to read just a -stanza or two in relation 
to this subject. The Lord said in Section 18 (I have heard President 
Grant quote this section — it is a very important matter) : 

Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ; 

For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; 
wherefore He suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and 
come unto Him. 

And He hath risen again from the dead, that He might bring all men 
unto Him, on condition of repentance. 

And how great is his joy in that soul that repenteth!_ 
Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 
And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto Me, how great shall 
be your joy with him in the kingdom of our Father! 



When I was at law school, I was made one of the editors of the 
Law Review. The boys who were working on the Review came to call 
me "Simon Legree — the slave-driver." It looks as if I were building a 
reputation here in the Church along the same lines. 



There is much concern today about the cause of liberty in the world. 
People are anxiously asking, "What is going to be the outcome of this 
war, and what will happen to the world if the dictators win?" I do not 
know the answers to these questions. It is not necessary that I should 
know, nor that you should know. 



It is important, however, that we do not permit ourselves to be 
unduly distracted when the hidden purposes of events and their end are 
not immediately clear to our perception. The lifetime of an individual is 
but a short span when reckoned against the stretch of history. What- 
ever the present may forebode, or the immediate future may bring we 
shall be better able to maintain our composure if we are fortified by an 
abiding "faith and confidence in God and in the triumph of His work" 
if, in the phrase of Bancroft we can say, "Eternal wisdom marshals the 
great procession of the nations, working in patient continuity through

the ages, never halting and never abrupt, encompassing all events in its 
oversight, and ever effecting its will . . . . " 

man's power fades 

Alexander conquered the world but the great general was scarcely 
dead when his vast empire crumbled and soon was no more. Cromwell 
made himself a mighty ruler but his power passed away with him. Na- 
poleon startled the world by the brilliancy of his achievements, but he 
was so unfortunate as to live to see the mighty empire he had welded 
fall apart before his eyes. 

Those who now are turning the world upside down will also die. 
The mischiefs they have wrought will then, if not sooner, by degrees 
be undone. The peoples of conquered nations, and of the conquering 
nations, too, for that matter, are not going to be content perpetually to 
submit to the stifling oppression under which they now suffer nor to the 
smothering of their instincts of freedom. It has always been the case 
that when tyranny becomes oppressive enough people revolt against it and 
shake it off. 

CALMNESS COMMENDED 

But all this does not mean that nations or peoples should resign 
themselves to the fate of being subdued. The struggle back out of the 
thraldom of tyranny is always waged through blood and sacrifice and 
heart-breaking rigors and disciplines. Bitter suffering must be endured 
before the will is steeled to the endeavor. 

It is infinitely wiser and safer to preserve the good one has than to 
suffer its annihilation and then have to go over the toilsome, grueling 
and thorny way of getting it back again. But the process of preservation 
is not facilitated by hysteria. The hysterical mind does not conceive ra- 
tionally, nor plan coherently nor execute effectively. Let us try in these 
difficult times to sift the truth out of the welter of confusion, to view 
it calmly and to decide with sobriety. 

LIBERTY A PRINCIPLE OF LIFE 

Of this we can be sure: Liberty is a thing of the spirit. A man 
must nourish it and cherish it in his heart as he does love for his wife 
and children. Except for its manifestation as a quality in human life it 
has no existence. Governments cannot confer it; they can only protect 
the individual in the enjoyment of it. Navies and armies cannot bestow 
it; they can only defend its exercise. No people can possess it unless 
they make themselves worthy of it. 

The lessons of Europe are fruitful for us if we will but read them. 
We are amazed at the ease with which some heretofore great nations 
have been subdued. The superficial explanation is lack of proper mili- 
tary armament. The true reason lies deeper and is the cause for the 
lack of preparation. 

Whether their undoing came from disloyalty, treachery, sedition, 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Dag 

resulting in betrayal, or whether it came from taking into their family 
bosoms designing aliens and falling prey to their seductive propaganda, 
or from the indolence and love of ease, and craving for the flesh pots 
which made them unwilling to subject themselves to the necessary ex- 
ertion and discipline and self-denial to protect their heritage does not 
much matter as it all comes to the same end anyway. 

The question forced upon us is, why should the people of a great 
nation become disloyal and seditious, why should they be beguiled by 
seductive portrayal of alien ideologies, why so flabby and soft and in- 
dolent and comfort-loving as to be unequal to the exertion of protecting 
their birthright ? 

CAUSES OF DOWNFALL OF NATIONS 

A building does not crash when the first termite begins to bore into 
its supporting beams. But when these have been allowed to multiply and 
continue their burrowing and tunneling and eating there comes a day 
when the fiber of the wood is so thoroughly destroyed that under the 
impact of some shock or addition of weight the support gives way and 
the structure comes tumbling down. It would be absurd to say that the 
new weight or the shock caused the structure to fall. We sometimes are 
bewildered at the sudden collapse of a man's character which theretofore 
had been rated high. It will generally be found that the degenerating 
process had been working in him a long time before the crash came. 

Strong nations, commanding great resources, do not fall in the days 
of their strength before an invading enemy. They first disintegrate from 
within. When their vital internal structure has been eaten away then the 
hollow shell collapses before the first onslaught of a virile foe. 

What we have been witnessing in Europe is not so much the con- 
quering might of an organized power, great as that is, as the mere push- 
ing over, with some minor and notable exceptions, of the hollow frame- 
works of governments whose sustaining spiritual integrity had already 
gone into decay. 

CONDITIONS IN AMERICA 

Now what of ourselves ? We know that we harbor here large num- 
bers, alien as well as native born, who openly advocate the superiority of 
alien principles of government over our own. Others there are who 
devote themselves to coddling the sowers of seeds of sedition and dis- 
loyalty. And with a discouraging universality we see the evidences of 
calculating self-interest, greed, indifference — a materialistic, grabbing, 
senseless scramble for the things which it is so mistakenly supposed will 
give a sense of security or satisfy the restlessness that is our very plague. 

We are saying that we face a great crisis, that the very existence of 
our nation is at stake. And yet one class of people is being told and is 
telling itself that it will not give up one whit of certain alleged gains it 
has made. It is willing to prepare for the emergency provided that it is 
not called upon to sacrifice anything. Another class is demanding as- 
surance against loss, and still another as a matter of self interest and 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



127 



expediency is willing to let vital things wait. By sections and communi- 
ties we are joining in the mad scramble. I read that the defense com- 
mission is being harassed and hampered by the clamors of localities, 
chambers of commerce, pressure groups, and politicians for the location 
of this or that industry in this or that place without regard for military 
requirement or efficiency of the whole program. We want to save our 
country if we can conveniently, but if it goes down we want to be able 
to say that our congressman got us a liberal part of the public funds and 
be sure that we hand ourselves over to the conquerer with plenty of pub- 
lic works on hand and our local vanity satisfied. 

Concerted action is required but jealousies and envy divide us. Our 
appraisals of value are inconstant and bewilderingly shifting. While in 
truth the interests of all classes are inseparably bound up together we 
have driven great wedges separating the industrialists from the laborers, 
and the agriculturists from both and the consumer from all the others. 
For a long time we have been stigmatizing large industries and denounc- 
ing them as baleful. Now we are frantically urging them to grow bigger 
and are offering capital for that purpose. What we have heedlessly de- 
cried as evils we now recognize as being our only hope for a speedy and 
large armament. One of our largest industrialists was within the year 
denounced as a national menace. Now we are dependent upon him in an 
inordinate degree to make us the defensive implements we need, all of 
which shows the folly of our periodic surges and revulsions of feeling 
toward the integrated elements of our nation. 

SPIRITUAL STRENGTH NEEDED 

This is all contrary to the spirit of universal brotherhood taught by 
the Savior of the world, and is our most alarming portent of danger, far 
more alarming than the power of any foreign foe. In recent years we 
have heard much over our country about economic security and about 
various notions for material betterment. Greater ease, more comfort, 
less toil have been flashed before us as symbolizing the highest ideals 
of human attainment. But we have heard almost nothing about spiritual 
strengthening, tightening of moral disciplines, subordination of person- 
al desires or the development of the wholesome spirit of give and take 
which make for a greater national unity and a more healthy and trustful 
and confidence-begetting relationship. Here is a task for the Church. 

I have noted with keen interest for a number of years now that 
from this pulpit in these Conferences, with growing emphasis there have 
been voiced persistent and reiterated pleas for a greater devotion to and 
cultivation of the spiritual values of life which ought to flow from our 
belief in and acceptance of the divine mission of the Savior of the world. 
The people have been begged to discipline themselves to the virtues of 
kindliness, unselfishness, self-denial, humility, reverence and justice ; 
to be abstemious, industrious, thrifty and self-reliant. Apparently 
thoughtful men among the laity are being shocked by world events into 
a realization of the perils which lurk in neglect of these bulwarks of 
strength. 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. Octobet 6 Third Dag 

About two years ago some observant British leaders sent out the 
warning to the people of the realm that the great issue which divides the 
world is at bottom a spiritual conflict in which good and evil spirits are 
working through mankind. "When the evil spirits conquer," said they, 
"the collapse of private and public morals sets in, the spirit of discipline 
and sacrifice dies," and they warned that Britain must make its choice 
between spiritual restoration and annihilation. How prophetic those 
words were stands now revealed. It might have been better for England 
if she had given earlier heed to them. 

winston churchill's notable words 

I am sure every listener must have thrilled to the appeal of Winston 
Churchill when upon his assumption of the premiership he warned his 
countrymen that he could promise them nothing but blood and tears and 
toil and sweat. That was, at the time of his speaking, a new note in the 
utterance of a modern public man, strange to our ears. And how magnif- 
icently Britons responded to the rallying call of their great leader who 
dared to tell them the naked unpleasant truth ! 

INDOLENCE SAPPING STRENGTH OF THE NATION 

I wish every man and woman in America might read and ponder 
an article by Dr. Alexis Carrel appearing in the September issue of the 
Reader's Digest. "Amusement" said he "has been our national cry; 'a 
good time' our chief concern. The perfect life, as viewed by the average 
youth or adult is a round of ease or entertainment, of motion pictures, 
radio programs, parties, alcoholic and sexual excesses. 

"This indolent and undisciplined way of life has sapped our indi- 
vidual vigor, imperiled our democratic form of government. Our race 
pitifully needs new supplies of discipline, morality and intelligence. 
Strange to say democracies have made no consistent effort to inculcate 
these qualities in their citizens. Although vast social betterment schemes 
have been projected, we have forgotten that these ultimately depend for 
their vitality upon the individual citizen. 'You cannot carve rotten wood,' 
says the Chinese proverb. Nor can you carve decayed character into the 
durable underpinnings of a better race." 

Forty men of prominence recently warned the people of America 
that "The democratic way of life, must be based ultimately on the reli- 
gious principle of the Fatherhood of God, and the worth and dignity of 
man when regarded as a child of God. It must uncompromisingly op- 
pose any effort at the deification of the State or the suppression of in- 
dividual liberty and sense of moral responsibility." 

A FORCE FIGHTING AGAINST GOD 

So long as armed aggression is rampant in the world proceeding 
upon the principle that the only deterrent to the gratification of every 
rapacious desire is the limit of brute force, peaceably inclined peoples 
must prepare themselves to repel that force. But, cautions the warning 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN

manifesto, unless a spiritual and moral resuscitation is worked and res- 
pect for religious values built up we shall arm in vain. 

We have used our freedom to renounce all discipline, and in the 
marvelous achievements of this industrial and scientific age we have 
grown arrogant and have discarded our ancient faith. The iconoclasts 
have been at work. — Those egotists who cannot rest happy so long as 
an unsullied name, eclipsing their own, Is allowed to stand untarnished, 
have been busy with their smear pots. They are called by the very ugly 
but very appropriate name de-bunkers. Nothing so much needs de-bunk- 
ing as they themselves. Because they cannot dissect God and examine 
His parts they have denied that He is; they have scoffed at the divinity 
of Jesus and because His benignity and purity and unselfishness and all- 
embracing compassion so far transcend their cynical powers of com- 
prehension, they have characterized Him a pretender and notoriety-seek- 
ing rabble rouser. The Ten Commandments are ridiculed as a defense- 
less and untrue imposition upon a primitive, uncultured and migrant 
people. Washington and Lincoln and the other great characters of his- 
tory they have with profane hands dragged down from their high pedes- 
tals and have dissected bit by bit, searched out and with malicious glee 
thrown upon the screen the distorted and magnified image of their every 
foible and blemish. The founders of our government, the f ramers of our 
Constitution are converted into self-seeking aristocrats bent only on pre- 
serving their advantages of station, while that great instrument itself is 
made the embodiment of palpably absurd and now outmoded eighteenth 
century philosophy. They are determined that nothing shall remain 
sacred or be revered. They have suceeded only too well. To maintain it- 
self strong in the present a people must be sustained by the conscious- 
ness of a noble past and the hope of a glorious future. Too much of the 
nobility of the past and the hope for the future has gone into eclipse. 

PRINCIPLES THAT LEAD DOWNWARD 

The gifts of this industrial age are mechanisms, gadgets, ease, lux- 
ury, diversions. These we have set up as principles by which we live in 
the place of faith in the nobility of man, reverence for his Maker and the 
discipline of our bodies, minds and spirits to the divine law. Our sub- 
stituted principles we find not to be principles at all but merely incident- 
als. Put to the test of realism they come tumbling down about us and men 
stand bewildered by their own impotence and futility. They have lost the 
sustaining power of great convictions. As for our government they are 
not convinced it is better than some others ; they do not really believe in 
our freedom, nor that it is in peril both from within and without, nor 
that its loss would be calamitous. They are not sure why they live in the 
earth at all, what life's purpose is nor what it is they want to do. 

TEACHING THE TRUTH NOT AN EASY TASK 

There must be a new cementing of shattered convictions, a re-estab- 
lishment of wavering faith, a calling back to basic principles. This again 



130 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Day 

is a task for the Church. It is a work for you Presidents of Stakes, and 
Bishops of Wards and other leaders. In its fulfilment you will have large 
need for moral courage because your leadership will involve your telling 
people unpleasant truths, things they would rather not hear. It will re- 
quire you to lead them in hard ways. 

As I read the history of the ancient prophets they were more often 
than not the bearers of unpleasant messages. It fell to them to tell kings, 
judges, rulers and people that the courses they were following portend- 
ed disaster and to admonish them against persistence in such courses. It 
was not an easy nor an inviting labor. It did not make them popular, but 
frequently jeopardized their lives and drove them into hiding. 

Jesus himself passed through the same experience. The next day af- 
ter He had miraculously fed the multitude the crowds sought Him on the 
opposite side of the lake whither He had gone in the night time. As they 
pressed upon Him He said to them, "Ye seek me, not because ye saw the 
miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." Then He 
proceeded to unfold His doctrine which imposed high requirements up- 
on any who would be His followers, stressing the preeminence of spir- 
itual values over material satisfactions. 

"It is," said He, "the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh prof iteth 
nothing ; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are 
life." His listeners complained that His sayings were hard, and began 
melting away. Sorrowfully and pathetically the chronicler records : "From 
that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him." 
So long as they were the recipients of gratuitous benefits they were 
eager followers, but their ardor turned cold when they found that the 
price of discipleship was renunciation and reformation. But that alone 
was then and is now the way of salvation. 

The Choir and congregation sang "Come Let Us Anew." 
PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Partly for the benefit of those who are on the air, and who cannot 
see us here, I wfsh to say that it is with profound gratitude and joy that 
we now turn the balance of the time over to President Grant. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is needless for me to tell you good people how grateful I feel that 
I am able to speak to you at the close of this Conference. As a rule I 
never put my remarks on paper, but my mind is not working as well 
the last five or six months as usual, and I therefore asked my secretary, 
Brother Anderson, to copy quite a number of things that I know off by 
heart, at least I did before my illness, but I do not know whether I know 
them today or not, so I am going to read to you. 

QUOTATION FROM "THE POWER OF TRUTH" 

There is nothing in all the world for which I am so grateful as an 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



131 



absolute knowledge that we, the Latter-day Saints, have the true Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. I read from William George Jordan's book "The 
Power of Truth." There are eight articles in the book. One year I 
distributed 7,500 copies of the first article, autographing them all, to 
friends. The author says : 

Law is the eternal truth of nature — the unity that always produces 
identical results under identical conditions. When a man discovers a great 
truth in Nature he has the key to the understanding of a million phenom- 
ena ; when he grasps a great truth in morals he has in it the key to his spirit- 
ual re-creation. For the individual, there is no such thing as theoretic 
truth; a great truth that is not absorbed by our whole mind and life, and 
has not become an inseparable part of our living, is not a real truth to us. 
If we know the truth and do not live it, our life is — a lie. * * * 

In exact proportion to the basic truth they contain do religions last, 
become permanent and growing, and satisfy and inspire the hearts of men. 
Mushrooms of error have a quick growth, but they exhaust their vitality 
and die; but truth still lives. 

The man who makes the acquisition of wealth the goal and ultimatum 
of his life, seeing it as an end rather than a means to an end, is not true. 
Why does the world usually make wealth the criterion of success, and riches 
the synonym of attainment? Real success in life means the individual's 
conquest of himself ; it means "how he has bettered himself," not "how 
has he bettered his fortune?" The great question of life is not "What have 
I?" but "What am I?" * * * 

Truth is the sun of morality, and, like that lesser sun in the heavens, we 
can walk by its light, live in its warmth and life, even if we see but a small 
part of it, and receive but a microscopic fraction of its rays. 

Which of the great religions of the world is the real, the final, the abso- 
lute truth ? 

It is the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, again restored to the earth 
by personal administration of our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus 
Christ. 

I shall now read what the Lord says — not what I say. It is not what 
Joseph Smith said, but what the Lord said to him : 

How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

FEW ARE CHOSEN 

Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson- 
That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, 
in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw them- 
selves ; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen 
to the Priesthood or the authority of that man. 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, October 6 Third Dan 

Behold, ere he is aware he is left unto himself to kick against the pricks, 
to persecute the saints, and to fight against God. 

LEARN BY EXPERIENCE 

We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, 
they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned; 

By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost ; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him 
whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy. 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death. 

A CONSTANT COMPANION 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall 
thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine of the 
Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an un- 
changing scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
forever and ever. 

These words coming from God I appeal to you people to read and 
reread. I have read them hundreds of times. They are from Section 
121 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and are among the greatest words 
ever given to the Prophet Joseph Smith as recorded in the Doctrine and 
Covenants. They were given to him in Liberty Jail shortly after he had 
been tried and sentenced to be shot, in connection with his brother 
Hyrum and others, by the State Militia. Thank the Lord for raising 
up General Doniphan, who declared that he would have nothing to do 
with such cold-blooded murder, and that he would withdraw his brigade. 
His remonstrance so alarmed them that they dared not put the decree 
into execution. 

I now read again — not the words of Joseph Smith, but the words of 
the Lord given to Joseph Smith : 

NONE TO ESCAPE 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not 
hear neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow ; for their iniqui- 
ties shall be spoken from the housetops and their secret acts shall be re- 
vealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 

Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them 
to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. 

Wherefore fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have de- 
creed in them shall be fulfilled. 

TO ENDS OF EARTH 

And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these 
tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both 
on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall 
be poured out upon the wicked without measure — • 

Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man 
according to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure 
which he has measured to his fellow man. 

Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all 
that will hear may hear; 

Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh ; 

And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and His sword is bathed in 
heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed ; and the day cometh that 
they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of His serv- 
ants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be 
cut off from among the people ; 

BROKEN COVENANT 

For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine 
everlasting covenant ; 

They seek not the Lord to establish His righteousness, but every man 
walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image 
is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, 
which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon 
the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Tun., 
and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; 

And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets— 

The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the 
mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither 
trust in the arm of flesh — 

But that every man might speak in the name of God, the Lord, even 
the Savior of the world; 

That faith might also increase in the earth ; 

That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

PROCLAIM FULNESS 

That the fulness of my Gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and 
the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

Behold, I am God and have spoken it ; these commandments are of me, 
and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner 
of their language, that they might come to understanding. 

And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known ; 

And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed ;_ 

And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might 
repent ; 

And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and 
blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time. 

And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my 



134 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. October 6 Third Day 

servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to translate through the 
mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon. 

And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have 
power to lay the foundation of this Church, and to bring it forth out of 
obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living Church upon the face 
of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking 
unto the Church collectively and not individually — 

ALLOWS NO SIN 

For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance ; 

Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord 
shall be forgiven; 

And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which 
he has received ; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the 
Lord of Hosts. 

And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth ; I the Lord 
am willing to make these things known unto all flesh ; 

For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 
peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his 
own dominion. 

And also the Lord shall have power over His saints, and shall reign 
in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

TRUTH ABIDES 

Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself ; 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same. 

For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen. 

LEAVES BLESSINGS 

I know as I know that I live, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of mankind. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and the instrument 
in the hands of God of again restoring to the earth the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, the plan of life and salvation. I leave my blessing 
upon the righteous people of all the world. I bless the Latter-day Saints 
at home and abroad, those holding positions of trust, and those that have 
gone forth to proclaim the Gospel. I promise them that the Spirit of the 
Lord shall attend them if they live clean and pure lives. 

I thank the Lord for this privilege of bearing my testimony again 
and making this declaration to the Saints in this Conference assembled. 
May God's blessings attend you through time and all eternity, is the 
earnest and sincere prayer of my heart. God bless you. Amen.

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith 

Taken from his sermons and writings as they are found in the Documentary 
History and other publications of the Church and written or published in 
the days of the Prophet's ministry 

Selected and arranged by the Historian, Joseph Fielding Smith, and his 
Assistants in the Historian's Office of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

Many of these discourses and writings appear in the Documentary 
History of the Church, but others have not been included in these volumes, 
but are scattered through the early publications of the Church. It has 
been difficult even for the student to obtain these because the old publica- 
tions are not accessible for general use. 

SPECIALLY PRICED AT $2.00

(Their Authors and Composers) 
By

song." 

So writes the author, George D. Pyper, in this fascinating story of an

Well illustrated throughout, this work will take a high place in literary 
circles, and will win a permanent spot in the hearts of all lovers of great 
and good music.

The hymn, "An angel from on high," was sung by Cyrus Martin, 
Irene Rich and the Tabernacle choir. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very thankful indeed for the opportunity of meeting with 
the Saints in another General Conference. I rejoice in the very splendid 
turnout that we see here today, and realize that, even with the overflow 
meeting in the Assembly Hall, there are many who will be disappointed 
in not getting room in this building or the adjoining one. But it is 
estimated that fully one hundred thousand people will hear these services 
today over the radio. 

I understand that the amplifier installed here will make it entirely 
unnecessary for me to raise my voice beyond that which would be 
needed in an ordinary hall. I am very glad of this for the reason that 
exerting oneself in order to be heard is very much more of a strain 
than to talk in just an ordinary voice. I should be very glad to know if 
any in this audience are failing to hear distinctly what I am saying at 
the present time. If so, will they kindly raise their hands. I discover 
that everybody is hearing my remarks, and I am not talking any louder 
than would be necessary in a room containing only a few hundred 
people. 

I earnestly and sincerely desire the faith and prayers of the Latter- 
day Saints to attend not only myself but all of the speakers during 
this conference, that they may be inspired by the Lord to say those 
things which will be calculated in their nature to encourage the Saints 
to renewed diligence in discharging the duties and obligations that rest 
upon them as members of the Church. 

CHANGES IN OFFICERS 

It will be interesting to you, no doubt, to know regarding the 
changes that have taken place since our last conference. 

The Wayne stake now has a new president^Brother William 
F. Webster.

alma's cry for repentance 

I will read from the 29th chapter of Alma in the Book of 
Mormon : 

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, 
and cry repentance unto every people ! 

"Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, re- 
pentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our 
God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content 
with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it 
be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men according 
to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



knoweth nut good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to 
him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or 
death, joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to 
perform the work to which I have been called? 

"Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the 
ends of the earth? 

"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and 
tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should 
have ; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that 
which is just and true. 

"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do 
not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me ; 
yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands 
of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy." 

THE JOY OF MISSIONARY WORK 

I believe that every Latter-day Saint who has received a testimony 
of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged has this same 
feeling that Alma had — a desire that all the world might hear the 
testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. When men and 
women receive a testimony of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, they are anxious that all the world should have that same 
knowledge and faith. They are anxious that the gospel should go to 
every honest soul. And there is no other labor in all the world that 
brings to a human heart, judging from my own personal experience, 
more joy, peace and serenity than proclaiming the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I remember that while I was laboring in Japan, on account 
of my failure to learn the language, I was not entirely happy in my work 
there. I remember going out into the woods, kneeling down and pray- 
ing to God that when my work was finished there I would appreciate 
it if I were called to the British Isles to succeed Brother Francis M. 
Lyman. Shortly after uttering that prayer I received a cable : "Come 
home on the first vessel." When I arrived home President Smith told 
me that they had decided to send me to Europe to succeed Brother 
Lyman. He said, "We realize that the two years or more that you 
have been in Japan have been anything but satisfactory from the stand- 
point of the joy that comes into the hearts of the missionaries in bring- 
ing souls to a knowledge of the truth, and we want you to have at least 
a year of real, genuine, missionary experience." When I went into his 
office and bade him goodbye, and said, "I will see you in a year," he 
said, "We have decided to make it a year and a half." I said, "Multiply 
it by two and say nothing about it, and it will please me," and that 
is exactly what he did. I was there a little over three years, and never 
have I had sweeter joy, more genuine satisfaction in my life than 
during those three years, when I had no thought except the spreading 
of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

THE WORTH OF SOULS 

We have recorded in the 18th section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants the following: 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



5 



"Remember, the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore, 
he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on conditions of repentance. 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And' if it so be that you should labor all j our days in crying repentance 
unto this people and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your 
joy with him in the kingdom of my father! 

"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my father, how great will be your joy if you should 
bring many souls unto me ! 

"Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my rock, and my salvation. 

"Ask the Father in my name, in faith, believing that you shall receive, and 
you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are expedient 
unto the children of men. 

"And if you have not faith, hope and charity, you can dc nothing. * * * 

"Behold, Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there 
is none other name given whereby man can be saved." 

The foregoing revelation was given through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, and they were instructed 
to seek out twelve apostles who should have the spirit of the mission to 
go forth and proclaim the gospel of glad tidings which the voice out 
of the heavens declared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigdon, as follows : 

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings which the voice out of the heavens 
bore record unto us — 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it 
from all unrighteousness; 

"That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his 
power and made by him." (Doc. and Cov. 76:40-42.) 

MEN HAVE SEEN CHRIST IN OUR DAY 

In that same revelation we find, and I have repeated it time 
and time again: 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the only begotten of the father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

We have this testimony to bear to the world, that men in our day 
have seen Jesus Christ; that he has restored to the earth the gospel 
of life and salvation ; that in the Kirtland temple the Savior appeared 
to Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith, also Moses, Elias and Elijah and 
that the keys of every dispensation of the gospel were committed into 
the hands of those two men. They were given this authority and it is 
a source of great joy. (Doc. and Cov. 110.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



WHAT THE CHURCH IS DOING TO PROCLAIM THE GOSPEL 

I rejoice in announcing that the Church is doing more today in 
the spreading of the gospel, and it has a larger body of missionaries in 
the field proclaiming the gospel, than at any other time in its history. 
A year ago we called for volunteers of men of maturity, men of 
experience and testimony, men who were seasoned in the gospel, to go 
out into the field for a period of six months. Hundreds responded 
to that call, and I have listened to some of the most remarkable and 
wonderful testimonies of the manifestations and blessings of the Lord 
to those men, as I have conversed with them upon their return home, 
that I have ever heard. The signs verily follow the believer in this 
Church, and people receive the witness of the Spirit wherever the 
gospel is preached. 

THE COMMAND TO PREACH THE GOSPEL SUPREME 

I have culled out a few quotations from the Doctrine and Covenants 
that I would like to read here: 

"Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in 
the authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father, and 
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." 

"And he that believeth shall be blest with signs following, even as it is 
written." — (Section 68: verses 8, 10.) 

"And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and 
tongue, and people. 

"And the servants of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice : Fear 
God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; 

"And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and, the sea, and the foun- 
tains of water." — (Section 133:37-39.) 

"I the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say ; but when ye do not what 
I say, ye have no promise." — (Section 82:10.) 

The one supreme thing that devolves upon me, upon you and upon 
every Latter-day Saint is the preaching of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, in public and in private, and above all to proclaim the 
gospel in our lives, by being absolutely honest in keeping the com- 
mandments of the Lord. 

WHO IS FITTED TO TEACH THE GOSPEL? 

No man can teach the Latter-day Saints under the inspiration of 
the Spirit of the living God, or proclaim to the world, that there has 
come a commandment from the Lord in our day for men to observe the 
ancient law of tithing, unless that man is a conscientious and honest 
tithe-payer. On the other hand, the inspiration of the living God 
attends those men who proclaim the law of tithing when they are 
obeying it themselves. No man can, under the inspiration of the Spirit 
of the Lord, warm the hearts of the Saints, or benefit the people of 
the world, by proclaiming the Word of Wisdom, who does not obey it 
himself. But the man who obeys the Word of Wisdom can touch the 
hearts of the Latter-day Saints in proclaiming that wonderful revela- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRAN1

tion that the Lord has given to us for our health and our benefit, and 
above all that has been given to us with a promise attached thereto. 
I desire to read that revelation from first to last: 

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

"A Word of Wisdom for the benefit of the council of High Priests, 
assembled in Kirtland, and the Church, also the saints in Zion — 

"To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation 
and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the 
temporal salvation of all saints in the last days—" 

And let me say right here that I am convinced beyond the shadow 
of a doubt that if the Latter-day Saints had observed the Word of 
Wisdom, and if the money that has been worse than wasted for tea, 
coffee, tobacco and liquor, had been utilized for missionary service, 
we would have had the millions of . dollars for the work of the Lord 
that has been expended for that which the Lord Almighty says is not 
good for man. 

"Given for a principle with premise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and 
the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of 
wisdom by revelation — 

"That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, 
behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling 
yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 

"And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, 
of your own make. 

"And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of 
your bodies. 

"And, again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle to be used with 
judgment and skill. 

"And, again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

"And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained 
for the constitution, nature and use of man — 

"Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof ; 
all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

"Yea, flesh also of beasts and of fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained 
for the use of man with thanksgiving ; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly ; 

"And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of 
winter, or of cold, or famine. 

"All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of 
life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, 
and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth ; 

"And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger. 

"All grain is good for the food of man ; as also the fruit of the vine ; that 
which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground. 

"Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, 
and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley 
for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain. 

"And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

i bedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow 
ill their bones ; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

"And shall run and, not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen." 

Let me read again: 

"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ycu do not 
what I say, ye have no promise." 

PROMISES OF GOD CONDITIONED ON OBEDIENCE 

There is no promise made to you or to me or to any Latter-day 
Saint that the destroying angel shall pass us by, or that we shall have 
hidden treasures of knowledge, unless we obey the Word of Wisdom, 
and the way above all other ways for men and women to teach their 
children the necessity of obeying the Word of Wisdom is by obeying 
it themselves. 

"There is a law irrevocably decreed, in heaven before the foundations of this 
world, upen which all blessings are predicated — * 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that 
law upon which it is predicated." (Doc. and Cov. 130:20, 21. ) 

I believe beyond the shadow of a doubt that there are hundreds 
and thousands of Latter-day Saints who but for the obeying of the 
Word of Wisdom would not be here today. When they have been 
attacked by serious diseases and have been in a critical condition 
physically, having obeyed that law, having fulfilled an irrevocable law 
of God, he was bound to bestow the promised blessings, and they have 
come to the afflicted ones. 

PARENTS MUST TEACH THEIR CHILDREN BY EXAMPLE 

We find recorded in section 68 : 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, cr in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the 
sin be upon the heads of the parents." 

"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized. 

"And their children shall he baptized for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands." 

"And they shall also teach their children to prav, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord." 

And the best way in the world to teach your children to pray and 
to walk uprightly before the Lord is to pray yourselves, thus setting 
an example of prayer, and to walk uprightly before the Lord yourselves. 
When a man fails to be honest as a tithe-payer, when he fails to observe 
the Word of Wisdom, the teaching of his children to obey those laws 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GR. INT

will have but very little effect. There is more in example than can 
possibly come by teaching. No amount of knowledge will save a man; 
no amount of marvelous revelations and visions and dreams will save 
a man. But the keeping of the commandments of the Lord and the 
obeying of those things which the Lord has revealed to us for our 
salvation, will give us a power and influence with our children for good, 
and we will be able to make an impression upon their hearts that will 
keep them in the straight and narrow path which leads to life eternal. 

JOSIAH QUINCY'S TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH 

When I picked up the memorandum that is supplied to me of the 
songs that are to be sung here this morning, I found that the first song 
that we were to sing today was, ''We thank, thee, O God, for a Pro- 
phet," and I remembered and immediately hunted up the quotation, a 
very remarkable tribute to the Prophet Joseph Smith, from Josiah 
Qjuincy, at one time the mayor of the great city of Boston; and while 
it has been read time and time again in our hearing, and published often 
at home and abroad, I thought I would like to read to you again the 
wonderful testimony of Josiah Ouincy, from a book entitled, The Figures 
of the Past. He says: 

"It is by no means improbable tbat some future text-book for the use of 
generations yet unborn will contain a question something like this : 'What 
historic American of the nineteenth century has wielded the most powerful 
influence upen the destinies of his country-men?' And it is by no means im- 
possible that the answer to this interrogatory may be thus written : 'Joseph 
Smith, the "Mormon" Prophet.' And the reply, absured as it doubtless seems 
to most men now living, may be an obvious commcnplace to their descendants. 
History deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The man 
who established a religion in this age of free debate, who was and is today 
accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High — 
such a rare human being is not to lie disposed of by pelting his memory with 
unsavory epithets. Fanatic, imposter, charlatan, he may have been ; but these 
hard names furnish no solution to the problem he presents to us. Fanatics and 
imposters are living and dying every day. and their memory is buried with 
them; but the wonderful influence which this fqunder of a religion exerted and 
still exerts throws him into a relief before us, not as a rogue to be incriminated, 
but as a phenomenon to be explained. The most vital questions Americans are 
asking each ether today have to do with this man and what he has left us. * * 
A generation other than mine must deal with these questions. Burning questions 
they are, which must give a prominent place in the history of the country to 
that sturdy self-asserter whom T visited at Nauvoo. Joseph Smith, claiming to 
be an inspired, teacher, faced adversity such as few men have been called to meet, 
enjeyed a brief season of prosperity such as few men have ever attained, and 
finally, forty-three clays after T saw him, went cheerfully to a martyr's death. 
When he surrendered his person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the 
shedding of blood, the prophet had, a presentiment of what was before him, 'I 
am gi ing like a lamb to the slaughter,' he is reported to have said, 'but I am as 
calm as a Summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense and shall 
die innocent'." 

(And a further quotation: "And it shall yet be said that I was 
murdered in cold blood," which is not in Josiah Quincy's statement.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"I have no theory to advance respecting this extra-ordinary man. I shall 
simply give the facts of my intercourse with him. 

"A fine looking man is what the passer-by would instinctively have murmured 
upon meeting the remarkable individual who had fashioned the mold which 
was to shape the feelings of so many thousands of his fellow mortals. But 
Smith was more than this, and one could not resist the impression that 
capacity and resource were natural t9 his stalwart person. I have already men- 
tioned the resemblance he bore to Elisha R. Potter of Rhode Island, whom 
1 met in Washington in 1826. The likeness was not such as would be recognized 
in a picture but rather one that would be felt in a grave emergency. 

"Of all men I have met these two seemed best endowed with that kindly 
faculty which directs, as by intrinsic right, the feeble or confused souls who are 
looking for guidance. 

"We then went on to talk of politics. Smith recognized the curse and 
iniquity of slavery, though he opposed the methods of the abolitionists. His 
plan was for the nation to pay for the slaves from the sale of the public lands. 
'Congress,' he said, 'should be compelled to take this course, by petitions from 
all parts of the country ; but the petitioners must disclaim all alliance not rec- 
ognized by the Constitution and which foment insurrection.' It may be worth 
while to remark that Smith's plan was publicly advocated eleven years later 
by one who mixed so much practical shrewdness with his lofty philosophy. 
In 1855, when men's minds had been moved to their depths on the question of 
slavery, Ralph Waldo Emerson declared that it should be met in accordance 
'with the interest of the south and with the settled conscience of the north. 
It is not really a great task, a great fight for this country to accomplish, to 
buy the property of the planter, as the British nation bought the West Indian 
slaves.' He further says that the United States will be brought to give every 
inch of their public lands for a purpose like this.' We who can look back upon 
the terrible cost of the fratricidal war which put an end to slavery, now say 
that such a solution of the difficulty would have been worthy a Christian 
statesman. But if the retired scholar was in advance of his time when he 
advocated this disposition of the public property in 1855, what shall I say of 
the political and religious leader who had committed himself, in print as well as 
in conversation, to the same course in 1844? If the atmosphere of men's opinions 
were stirred by such a proposition when war clouds were discernible in the 
sky, was it not a statesmanlike word eleven years earlier when the heavens 
looked tranquil and beneficent?" 

It was a statesmanlike and an inspired proposition from a man 
who was in very deed a prophet of the true and living God. 

"General Smith proceeded to unfold still further his views upon politics. 
He denounced the Missouri Compromise as an unjustifiable concession for the 
benefit of slavery. It was Henry Clay's bid for the presidency. Dr. Goforth 
might have spared himself the trouble of coming to Nauvoo to electioneer for 
a duelhst who would fire at John Randolph, but was not brave enough to protect 
the Saints in their rights as American citizens. Clay told his (Smith's) people 
to go to the wilds of Oregon and set up a government of their own. Oh, yes, 
the Saints might go into the wilderness and obtain the justice of the Indians, 
which imbecile, time-serving politicians would not give them in the land of 
freedom and equality. The prophet then talked of the details of government. 
He thought the number of members admitted to the lower house of the national 
legislature should be reduced. A crowd only darkened counsel and . impeded 
business. A member for every half million of population would be ample. The 
powers of the president should be increased. He should have authority to put 
down rebellion in a state, without waiting for the request of any governor ; for 
it might happen that the governor himself would be the leader of the rebels. 
It is needless to remark how later events showed the executive weakness that 
bmitn pointed out — a weakness which cost millions of treasure. * * *

"Born in the lowest ranks of poverty, without book learning and with the 
homeliest of all human names, he had made himself at the age of 39 a power 
upon the earth. Of the multitudinous family of Smiths, none had so won 
human hearts and shaped human lives as this Joseph. His influence, whether 
for good or evil, is potent today, and the end is not yet. 

"I have endeavored to give the details of my visit to the 'Mormon' prophet 
with absolute accuracy. If the reader does not know just what to make of 
Joseph Smith, I cannot help him out of the difficulty. I myself stand helpless 
before the puzzle." 

JOSEPH SMITH'S PROPHECY OF THE MIGRATION WEST 

The Latter-day Saints do not stand helpless before the puzzle. 
They rejoice in the wonderful inspiration of the man who prophesied 
that "the Latter-day Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and 
many would be put to death by their persecutors, and others would lose 
their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, but some would live 
to go and make settlements, build cities and see the Saints become a 
mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains." 

What kind of a place was the Rocky Mountains when this re- 
markable prophecy was uttered? One of the greatest American states- 
men, Daniel Webster, is reported to have said regarding it: 

"What do we want with this vast, worthless area? This region of savages 
and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and whirlwinds of dust, of cactus 
and prairie dogs ? To what use could we ever hope to put these great deserts 
or those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their very base 
with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast of 
three thousand miles, rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting and not a harbor on it? 
Mr. President, I will never vote one cent from the public treasury to place the 
Pacific coast one inch nearer Boston than it now is." 

GOVERNMENT PLACED STAMP OF DIVINITY ON PROPHET'S UTTERANCE 

I rejoice in an individual testimony of the truth of the statements 
of Joseph Smith, that his name should be had for good and evil in 
all parts of the world ; that the time would come when not only a city, 
a county and a state should be arrayed against the handful of people 
called "Mormons," but the day would come when the whole United 
States of America should be arrayed against them. And the army of the 
United States was sent against them, and the government of the United 
States did confiscate all of the property belonging to the Church. Day 
after day and month after month during the litigation for the return 
of the Church property I picked up the paper and read, "The United 
States of America versus the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints." And I have laid the paper down and said, "Thank the Lord 
that the United States have placed the stamp of divinity upon the 
utterances of the Prophet Joseph Smith." 

THE GREAT OBLIGATION OF THE SAINTS TO DECLARE THE RESTORATION 

Our boys and girls go out into the world with a love of the gospel, 
young, inexperienced men and women, and God gives to them the 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



witness of the Spirit and an individual testimony so that they can stand 
up and say before all the world, "I know that God lives, I know that 
|esus is the Christ, I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the true 
and living God, and that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the plan 
of life and salvation, has been restored to the earth through his in- 
strumentality. The one and great thing that devolves upon me, upon 
you, and upon all Latter-day Saints is that this proclamation shall be 
sent to all the world, and I rejoice in knowing that it has never been 
carried with more force and by a greater number of faithful, diligent 
workers than at the present time. 

May God bless each and every one of us who has a testimony and 
a knowledge that He lives and that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith was . a prophet of the true and living God, so to order our 
lives that all men seeing our diligence, our humility, our charity, 
our love of our fellows, may be led to investigate the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of the Lord our Redeemer. 
Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

CONCERNING PLURAL MARRIAGES 

Here is a statement that I would like to read : "Notwithstanding 
frequent verbal and printed instructions issued by President Joseph F. 
Smith and counselors to the effect that the solemnization of plural 
marriages was prohibited by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and these instructions having been reiterated time and time again 
by myself as President, cases occasionally arise where certain individuals 
are teaching that it is legitimate to enter into plural marriage, and that 
such marriages can be performed by certain members of the Church 
claiming to have authority to do so. 

"The revelations of the Lord inform us most plainly that there is 
but one man on earth at a time who holds the keys of this sealing power ; 
namely, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. As President of the Church, I once again solemnly declare 
that no man living has the authority to solemnize a plural marriage; 
and I hereby announce that it is the bounden duty of every Latter-day 
Saint, male and female, who knows of any such pretended marriage 
being performed, to inform the proper officers of the Church, in order 
that the Church's honor may be maintained and that such individuals 
may be dealt with according to the rules and regulations of the Church 
and excommunicated therefrom." 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

My brethren and sisters: I rejoice greatly, and praise the Lord, 
who is our strength, and upon whom we depend for guidance and 
support, for the manifestation of his goodness to us as it is exemplified 
in this large assembly of Latter-day Saints who are gathered here for 
the semi-annual conference of the Church. 

As I look upon this congregation and review the circumstances 
which have brought it together, going back into the remote past, and 
see, or appear to see, how literally the Lord fulfills his promises to 
people with whom he enters into covenant, my heart is made to rejoice. 

PURPOSE OF THESE GENERAL ASSEMBLIES 

The purpose of these general assemblies of the Church is that 
those who have been chosen to preside over it, and its members may 
be brought together from time to time where report of the progress 
and development of the work of the Lord may be made, when instruc- 
tion may be given, when we may be admonished, where admonition is 
necessary, and encouraged where we need encouragement. 

FEATURES WHICH DIFFERENTIATE OUR CHURCH FROM OTHER CHURCHES 

There are so many distinctive features which differentiate the 
Church from other religious denominations that it is impossible, in a 
short period of time, to refer to even a comparatively small number 
of them. This is one of those distinctive features, this great gathering 
of the Church, which occurs twice during the year. Another dis- 
tinctive feature is that these people who are assembled here, who make 
up the membership of the Church, are its controlling influence and 
power under God. Those who preside are placed here by the voice 
of the Spirit of the Lord, and sustained by the voice of the people. 
The people uphold them with their faith and prayers and they depend 
upon the Lord for inspiration and wisdom to properly direct the 
affairs of the Church for the benefit of all its members. It is not a 
Church in which the individual members depend entirely upon the 
instruction and testimony which come to them from their presiding 
officers. The testimony of the truth which brings them together 
is their individual gift and right, and they are here and adhere to 
the faith because the Lord has manifested his truth to them by the 
power and gift of the Holy Ghost, and they are not dependent upon 
others for this knowledge. 

AN ALLEGED RETROGRADE MOVEMENT IN THE CHURCH 

Only a short time ago, just a few months, during the present 
year, a gathering of representatives of other religious denominations, 
from all parts of this intermountain country, assembled at Salt Lake 
City. They discussed the interests of their various organizations, and 
among other things, as usual, discussed the Church of Jesus Christ of 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Latter-day Saints, which they continue to refer to as a non-Christian 
organization, and they took great comfort, apparently, in the reports 
which were made from various representatives of those denominations 
to the effect that they had at last succeeded in battering down the 
walls of this American Islam, that Christianity was making way 
among the Latter-day Saints ; that the activities of our elders were 
decreasing; and the tithes of the Church gradually being depleted. 
In other words, that there was a retrograde movement in the Church 
which appeared to encourage them in the hope that its members might 
eventually be converted to the Christian faith. I shall not enter into 
a discussion of this matter. The proceedings of this great convention 
were published and may be read. I thought, as I looked upon this 
congregation of men and women, that it is sufficient answer to these 
people. We encourage and bless them in their righteous efforts, and 
the Lord will bless them for all the good that they accomplish. But 
they are ignorant of the fact that these Latter-day Saints, these 
people whom they are endeavoring to convert to Christianity, have 
been converted, not by argument, not by reason alone, but by the gift 
of the holy Spirit through which they bear testimony to the divinity 
of the mission and character of the Redeemer of the world as no 
other people. 

THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND THE DOMINANT CHURCH IN MEXICO 

Reviewing the occurrences of the past six months, and to a care- 
ful observer they have been pregnant with events indicating the rapid 
approach of the consummation of the work of the Lord, I have been 
impressed with two occurrences more particularly than others during 
that period of time. The present attitude of the civil government in 
the Republic of Mexico toward the dominant church in that Republic 
is of greater importance to the world than we generally understand. 
It is not a question which involves Mexico alone, but is one which 
involves all of the churches of the world, and the results which shall 
be achieved there, whether the civil government of Mexico shall 
prevail in its present attitude, or whether the church which is opposed 
to it shall prevail, will have a great influence upon the relationship of 
the church and state everywhere. 

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE MUST BE DETERMINED 

It appears to me to indicate that a time has come when the proper 
relationship which should exist between Church and State, between 
civil and ecclesiastical law, between those who administer civil govern- 
ment and those who stand as Jrepresentatives of the church or the 
various religious denominations of the world, must be determined. 

That there is a proper relationship is clearly defined in the word 
of the Lord, and in the teachings of the Redeemer himself. Give to 
Caesar that which belongs to him ; render obedience to the civil law. 
Give to God that which belongs to him, and render allegiance and 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



15 



service to him. This can be done very readily if people can only be 
brought to understand the proper relationship of these two great 
administrative powers. One of the accusations made against Christ 
our Lord was that he had declared himself to be a king. Yes, he 
said before Pilate, I am a king, but my kingdom is not of this world. 
I am not here in antagonism to the kingdom of Herod, or to the 
empire of Rome. My kingdom pertains to the life to come. I am 
here to teach people the way which will lead them back to God, where 
they will attain to everlasting life, and where they may be crowned 
as kings and priests of the Most High. 

L. D. S. MORE THAN OTHERS DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION 

I shall not enter into any lengthy discussion of this question. 
I only desire to call your attention to it. Latter-day Saints are per- 
haps more directly interested in it than any other people in the world, 
from the fact that the Republic of Mexico is made up in the great 
majority of its citizens of people whom the world calls Indians, but 
to whom the Latter-day Saints refer as Lamanites, people whom we 
believe to be of the chosen and promised seed of Abraham, brought 
to this continent and established here under the direction of God our 
Father, under the leadership of their inspired prophets. 

THE LAMANITES OR INDIANS OF MEXICO 

They developed a great civilization, but finally through unbelief, 
infidelity, and indifference to the word of the Lord, and the teachings 
of the Christ who ministered among them, fell into darkness, became 
divided into tribes, were decimated by civil war until they finally 
so far lost the spirit of the gospel of Christ that they became idolaters 
and offered human sacrifices, practices that were entirely foreign 
to the teachings of their fathers. It was in this condition that the 
conquerors of Mexico found them. Their prophets had warned them 
that this would come to pass. They had exhorted them to turn from 
idolatry, had declared to them that they should be trodden down of 
the Gentiles, who would come to this promised land, but just as 
definitely and surely as their subjugation by foreigners had been de- 
clared, so did the Lord promise to their fathers that they should be 
redeemed; that a remnant of tfiem should survive and be brought 
back to a knowledge of. the truths of the gospel of Christ and of 
their real origin. And so we look forward to the evolution of con- 
ditions in that country that will bring about the fulfilment of this 
latter promise. No people of modern times have been so down-trodden, 
so persecuted, so afflicted, so burdened with unreasonable burdens as 
have the people of Mexico during the past four hundred year's 
Nothing in the way of suffering could be inflicted upon humanity 
that has not been inflicted upon them. Mercilessly treated by their 
conquerors, reduced to slavery, they have suffered throughout all these 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



generations. The Lord in his mercy, and undoubtedly by means so 
natural and common that many will not see his hand in it, will redeem 
them from that condition. 

RETRIBUTION HAS COME TO THEIR PERSECUTORS 

And retribution has come to their persecutors. It is a remarkable 
fact that of these men who brought that nation into subjugation, there 
was not one, so far as I am aware, who did not pay the penalty for 
the suffering he inflicted upon them during his mortal life. Columbus, 
the discoverer of this country, the man who was entitled to honor and 
glory far greater than he ever received, consented to the 'traffic in 
these peoples as slaves and sent them by shiploads to the old world. 
You all know how he died at Vallad'olid, in Spain, how he was cast 
into prison, how he was stripped of the honors which belonged to him, 
and died in that condition. 

Hernan Cortez, the conqueror of Mexico, suffered the same fate. 
Francisco Pizarro and his friend Almagro, the conquerors of the Peru- 
vian empire, likewise suffered. Pizarro killed Atahaulpa, and later 
killed Almagro, his bosom friend. The younger Almagro killed Pizarro, 
and he in turn was killed by the governor of the country. Thus one 
by one retribution came to them. I believe this law to be as inevitable 
as fate itself ; that we reap that which we sow. 

SHALL CHURCH OR GOVERNMENT RULE, OR EACH IN ITS SPHERE? 

So, my brethren and sisters, we feel interested in this movement, 
this conflict which is now on in that country and which shall determine 
whether or not the civil government or the church shall rule, or 
whether the church and the civil government will join hands and in 
harmonious obedience to both civil and ecclesiastical law go on to the 
development of this continent as God our Father would have it develop. 

THE BRITISH-ISRAEL MOVEMENT 

Another thing in which I thought you would be interested is a 
great movement which is just on in Great Britain, which has been of 
exceeding interest to me. An association is in existence there which is 
sponsored by many of the great scholars and statesmen of Great Britain, 
called the British-Israel movement. The British people are under- 
taking to determine who their ancestors were. They have become 
obsessed with the thought that they are of Israel, and are investigating 
and studying, going back into the old traditions and folk-lore of Wales, 
of Ireland, of England and Scotland, in an endeavor to determine the 
origin and destiny of the British race. And this in brief is what they 
are finding out: In the first place that the word "British" itself is 
very significant. Tasked a Jewish Rabbi the other day the derivation 
of the word "British." He said in Hebrew it was composed of two 
words, "Brit"— a covenant, and "ishV— a man. A covenant man, or a 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



17 



man of the covenant, the covenant which God our Father made with 
Abraham, the covenant in which he promised him that his seed should 
become as numerous as the stars of heaven — a covenant in which he 
promised him that kings should come out of him, and that through him 
all of the nations of the earth should be blessed. 

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTIGATION 

I cannot take the time to go into detail, but it is sufficient for me 
to say that these investigations show very conclusive, if not definite, 
evidence that at an early date in the history of the world, not long 
after the ten tribes were led away captive into Assyria by Shalmaneser, 
the tribe of Dan appeared in Ireland and went over into the Scandi- 
navian countries, and there again you will find this singular coincidence, 
(Dan is one of the tribes of Israel) that Denmark means Dan's Land, 
or the Land of Dan. 

I noted down here, that I might not be too long, just a few of the 
developments in this investigation. It was after the scattering of the 
ten tribes that Troy was established, and it is made almost definitely 
certain that the Trojans, and the nations who lived in the time which 
we call the age of fable, where the remnants of those scattered tribes of 
Israel which left the head of the Euphrates river and traveled north over 
the mountains into Northern Europe. They say that the early appear- 
ance of the tribe of Dan is very clearly proven. Later came another 
division of this same people to Scotland, where they were established. 
There appeared in Ireland, six hundred years before Christ a great 
Israelitish lawgiver, who enforced the observance of the Ten Command- 
ments and established a school of the prophets, who was called Ollam 
Fodhla, two Hebrew words said to mean "wonderful prophet." A 
medallion now in existence in Great Britain is said to identify this 
man with the Prophet Jeremiah. 

An old manuscript which has been dug up in the British Museum 
identifies a great character who came there about the same time as 
Joseph of Arimathea, who came with his daughter Anna to that 
country. This man, the evidence indicates, was a younger brother 
of the father of the Virgin Mary, thus Anna became the cousin of 
the Virgin. The royal family of Great Britain trace their genealogy 
back direct to this woman Anna. There can be no doubt in regard to 
this. The only question in doubt is the identity of Anna and some of 
the scholars in Great Britain agree that she appears to have been a 
cousin of the Virgin Mary. 

SYMBOLISM OF THE BRITISH COAT OF ARMS 

The British coat of arms I desire to refer to just for a moment. 
T think that none of us has very seriously undertaken to define its 
symbolism and meaning : The lion of the house of David is shown on 
it ; the unicorn, to which the Lord likened Joseph when he said that 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his horn should be like the horn of the unicorn, which should push the 
people together from all parts of the earth ; the harp, which was the 
banner of David. There are ten symbols on the British coat of arms, 
which appear to represent the ten tribes of Israel. And these were 
not put there because of the knowledge which modern Britain had 
of their significance at the time of their adoption. It was the heraldry 
which had been handed down to them from generations long past. 

WHAT THE SAINTS HAVE TRIED FOR YEARS TO TEACH THE BRITISH 

The thing which interested me most was that these British people 
are just beginning to find out what the Latter-day Saints have been 
trying to teach to them for nearly a hundred years. This great con- 
gregation of people which is assembled here this morning — if you 
should go to the Presiding Patriarch of the Church, whose right it is 
because of his calling to designate your genealogy — he would almost 
without exception declare you to be the seed of Joseph, and in the great 
majority of cases through the lineage of Ephraim, for this is the land 
which was given to Ephraim — these everlasting hills. His blessing 
was greater than that bestowed upon his ancestors. Jacob said that it 
extended to the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills. And so tlTis 
pushing together is occurring, and here Ephraim is gathering in ful- 
filment of the unchangeable words of the prophets of the Lord. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, there is much more — oh, a world 
of interesting evidence that is being unearthed, not by enthusiasts, not 
by foolish people, but by scholars, by Egyptologists, by men who 
understand — until the thought is becoming almost universal in the 
British Isles, that Israel is there, where we have always known them 
to be. 

A STUDY OF THE PYRAMID OF GIZEH 

Another interesting development is a more careful study of the 
great pyramid of Gizeh in Egypt. What is it? Why was it put there? 
It is one of the most wonderful things that exist in the world, a miracle 
in stone. We cannot call it anything else. It stands in the spot where 
the Prophet Isaiah said the Lord should establish an altar which would 
stand as a sign and a witness to the Lord in the land of Egypt in the 
latter days. It is said to be the only perfectly oriented structure iri 
the world, and yet it was put there at a time when the civilization of 
the world was not supposed to have developed as it is developed at the 
present time. It is the largest structure in the world. It is said to 
record the history of the Adamic race during the six thousand years 
of its existence. It was called by the ancient Egyptians, Khuti, which 
in Hebrew means the Urim, or Urim and Thummim. Its exterior 
was polished so that it reflected light as nothing of similar kind had 
ever done before. It is not the tomb of a king. Its measurements are 
said to be the most accurate that the world knows at the present time. 
Its proportions are in exact measurement and harmonize with the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



19 



surface of the earth. It represents the relationship of the earth to the 
heavenly bodies. 

I opened the Pearl of Great Price a few months ago and read 
the story of Abraham in Egypt, where the book tells us that he was 
sitting upon Pharaoh's throne, discussing with those people astronomy 
and the mysteries of godliness with which they were not familiar. 
According to eminent scholars of Great Britain the pyramid is so 
accurately arranged in its measurements and symbols that it has out- 
lined many great and important events which have occurred since its 
erection, which apply to the Israelitish people. It indicates a date on 
the 6th or 7th of April — there is a little difference of opinion but 
some great event was to occur on the 6th or 7th day of April, which 
is interpreted to be the date of the crucifixion of the Redeemer of the 
world. Its measurements indicate the beginning of the great war in 
1914, and its termination in 1918. More than ninety per cent of the 
events chronicled, according to measurements, have already been ful- 
filled. The scholars of Great Britain tell us that between the present 
date and 1936 or 193&', the record so far as it applies to this monument 
in stone will have been completed. There is nothing which appears 
after that date. And so they look for the accomplishment of great 
events during this period. 

I do not give this to you, my brethren and sisters, as correct in 
every detail, but it is the conclusion of some of the best informed men of 
the British Empire, and is not out of harmony with the word of 
the Lord as he has revealed it to us. It is not out of harmony, if you 
have been a close observer during the past six months, with the things 
which have occurred in the world at large. It is not out of harmony 
with the words of the Redeemer himself who warned the world that in 
this dispensation, and not far from this time, for it is nearly a hundred 
years since the organization of the Church, that he will consummate 
his work so far as it applies to the Gentile nations of the world. 

PREDICTIONS FROM THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 

I am going to take the liberty to read a few words from the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that my study of these things has brought 
to my mind. There are here the Presidents of the missions of the 
Church. There are in this congregation thousands of men and women 
who have gone out as missionaries from the Church declaring these 
truths to the people, as President Grant has stated : 

"And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people. 

"For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall 
cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and 
shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice 
of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea 
heaving themselves beyond their bounds. 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And all things shall be in commotion; and surely men's hearts shall fail 
them; for fear shall come upon all people." 

BE PREPARED FOR COMING GREAT EVENTS 

Do you see anything, my brethren and sisters, in current events 
which indicate the approach of a period of this kind? Be prepared 
then for it. In what way? Just by serving the Lord. Just b} 
continuing- in devoted work in the gospel of his kingdom. Just by 
observing the laws of the land and, the laws of the Lord as they are 
exemplified in the discipline of the Church. There ought not to be 
a violator of the civil law in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. There should not be a boot-legger, should not be a blasphemer ; 
there should not be a man or woman bearing false witness against his 
or her neighbor. There should not be a man or woman whose heart 
and spirit is not in harmony with the doctrines taught by the Redeemer 
of the world. And if this condition can be attained and shall con- 
tinue in the Church; if we shall be as we declare we are, subject to 
kings and to potentates, to presidents and to governors, wherever our 
lot is cast, and at the same time go. on in our devoted service to the 
Lord our God, keeping his commandments, having faith in the words 
of his servants, the prophets, looking steadfastly forward to the ac- 
complishment of his purposes, I promise you that when this time of 
awful trouble comes which the British seers say is at our very doors, 
and it will come, his protecting hand will be over us, and he who is 
powerful, he who can deliver, he who can protect, will give us pro- 
tection and deliverance. 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIESTCRAFT AND PRIESTHOOD 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, keep us all from the 
sins of the world, keep us clean and unspotted, make us more devoted 
if possible to his word and more loyal and patriotic to the government 
of which we form a part. For without this government the Church of 
Christ could not exist, unless God should manifest his power in an 
unusual manner in our behalf. He has raised up this government and 
the men who direct its affairs for our protection and benefit, for the 
protection and benefit of the people of the world in righteousness. 
But whenever people depart from the way of righteousness, whenever 
priestcraft shall take the place of Priesthood, God's mercy will be 
withdrawn. (Distinguish between the words — priestcraft is that system 
by which men pretend to speak and act in the name of the Lord 
without authority and without power ; Priesthood is the keys and 
authority to properly act and speak in the name of the Lord, and 
the power of the Priesthood will be manifest in the Works of 
those who exercise it. And that characterizes the lives of these 
men. these apostles who are before you, these presiding seventies, 
and presidents of missions. They exercise the Priesthood of the Lord 
our God through proper authority, and they exercise it in a proper way.) 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



21 



When priestcraft shall assume that which does not belong to it, then 
God's mercy and protection will be withdrawn. Go on and read the 
remainder of this eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
(I do not like to read it here) because it tells us what is going to 
happen to priestcraft, and it is coming with those other manifestations 
of the power of the Lord which are so prevalent. 

May the blessing of the Lord be with you, my brethren and sisters. 
We pray for you, we work for you, we love you. Our only desire is 
to be of service to you, forgetting ourselves. And I want to bear 
witness that never in the history of the Church have men more un- 
selfishly directed its affairs than at the present time. I know this 
from my association with these men, with the Presidency, with the 
members of the Council of the Twelve. They are here to sacrifice every- 
thing for the welfare of the members of the Church of Christ. God 
help us all to follow -that example, I pray through Jesus Christ. Amen.

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The meeting opened at 2 p. m., Sunday, October 3, 1926; President 
Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the man 
who communed with Jehovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder John M. Baxter, president of the 
Woodruff stake. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Go, ye messengers of glory." 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

My brethren and sisters: It has always been a considerable task 
for me, at the general conferences, to address these large gatherings of 
Latter-day Saints, although I have had many years' experience. Ap- 
proaching a task of this kind gives one a feeling of awe. 

A GREAT WORK ^ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SAINTS 

I rejoice in the work that the Lord has accomplished with the help 
of his Saints, imperfect as most of us are. Under his guidance and 
direction we have been able to accomplish a igreat work. I believe 
that he would say now, as he said to the Church in former days, that 
he is well pleased with his Church collectively — not individually, but 
collectively.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



GRATITUDE TO GOD FOR THIS AGE AND NATION 

I feel very grateful for the privilege of being here. I often think 
what a grand thing it is to be permitted to live in the world today — this 
wonderful age of the world, with its marvelous developments of science 
and art, and the great progress that has been made from the conditions 
of the world as they existed two or three hundred, or even a hundred 
years ago. What a different world ! And what a wonderful land of 
liberty we are living in — a choice land; under the freest and best of all 
governments on the face of the earth; where there is more security, 
more protection for the rights and liberties of the people, than there is 
in any other nation. The hand of the Lord has guided the destinies of 
this great nation, for he it was that planned it. 

He tells us in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith which we 
often quote : "I, the Lord, raised up wise men for this very purpose" ; 
that is, to found this government; and it has had divine guidance all 
the way through. The people here in the United States, even those who 
are not so well off financially, are housed better, fed and clothed better, 
and better situated than the rich and well-to-do in most other nations. 
Never before in all the history of the world has there been a nation 
like this, of such commanding importance, and yet not desiring any- 
thing but what rightfully belongs to it. I 

REVERENCE FOR GOD 

I was glad to read the inaugural address of President Coolidge, 
delivered a year ago last March, particularly the closing paragraph 
wherein 'he showed such reverence for God. He concluded the address 
with these words : 

"America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force. No ambition, 
no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions. The legions which 
she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but with the cross. 

"The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankind is not 
of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no purpose save to merit the 
favor of Almighty God." 

"She cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of Almighty 
God". These words constitute an acknowledgment of God in the af- 
fairs of the nation, and a desire to be governed by the spirit of right- 
eousness and justice, to do good and to uphold the principles of freedom. 

THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY 

The liberty that we enjoy today has come only after a hard struggle 
in the world. Four hundred years ago the fight for freedom was on. 
The reformers, as they are called— Martin Luther, John Knox and 
others— rose up and protested against the tyranny to which they were 
subjected. They demanded more liberty. They were few in number 
compared to the many millions, but under the blessing of the Lord 
they conquered. (Finally, little by little, liberty was conceded to the 
people by the potentates and popes that then ruled the world. But it 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY

was a hard struggle and cost some of the best blood of that period. The 
Rise of the Dutch Republic, by Motley, gives a graphic description of the 
terrible sufferings endured by the Dutch people in this long fight for 
liberty. For the liberties that we enjoy today we are indebted in large 
measure to the people of the Netherlands. For many years they fought 
most valiantly for religious freedom and the extension of the rights 
and liberties of the citizen against all the might and power of 
Catholic Spain, backed by the Spanish Inquisition. They were small 
in number and weak indeed compared to the thousands and tens of 
thousands of Spanish troops, led by the notorious Duke of Alva. But 
they finally conquered. Why ? Because the guidance of the Lord was 
with them, and he gave them his favor and blessing. 

A hundred years later the same desire for liberty was again man- 
ifested. Oliver Cromwell was raised up, and he fought a good fight 
and kept the faith. We are also largely indebted to him, and to those 
who fought with him, for the freedom that exists in America today. 

A hundred years after that we find George Washington and the 
patriot fathers contending for the liberties of the people, and the Lord 
gave divine guidance to them. They could not have succeeded without 
his help. His power and his hand were over them. 

So, as we heard from President Ivins this morning, it comes about 
in the progress of the spirit of freedom and liberty, that the Lord has 
prepared the way in this nation for his Church to be established. 

(DISTINCTION BETWEEN DIVINE GUIDANCE AND DIVINE AUTHORITY 

But here let me emphasize one thought. To all of these men — 
Luther, Knox, Cromwell, Washington, and their compeers — there was 
given divine guidance. But they did not have divine authority. The 
Lord today gives divine guidance to good people of the world who seek 
him — and many millions do. It is true that there is a divinity that shapes 
our ends (and the ends of nations, too) rough-hew them as we will. But 
he has not given to the'm divine authority. As we heard this morn- 
ing, religious denominations sometimes meet together and pass resolu- 
tions against us. They are without divine authority. And there is a 
marked distinction between divine guidance and divine authority. People 
can see and acknowledge the guiding hand of Almighty God in the 
formation of this government and in its growth and development. It is 
plain to many that we have enjoyed his favor as a nation. But as to 
divine authority, that is different. Let me read from the very first 
revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants : 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, [We heard from Presi- 
dent Grant this forenoon of the necessity of preaching this gospel to all the 
nations of the earth] by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in 
these last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 

"Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants." 

That is a little different from divine guidance.

CliNER. IE CONFERENCE 



In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, when he was 
only seventeen years of age, in 1823, we read: 

"Behold, I will reveal unto you tlie Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the 
proph< t, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 

• And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the 
fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. 

"If it urn not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming." 

DIVINE AUTHORITY CONFERRED BY HOLY MESSENGERS 

Was that divine authority bestowed? Let me read another section. 
On the 15th day. of May, 1829, an angel of the Lord, known as John 
the Baptist when he lived upon the earth in the days of the Savior, 
appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and conferred upon 
them, in these words, the (Priesthood of Aaron : 

"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priest- 
hood of Aaron, which hold,s the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the 
gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 
and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do 
offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness." 

Here is divine authority. Do any of our friends or neighbors make 
such a claim? We know the claim of the (Catholic church, and all we 
say in response is that "By their fruits ye shall know them." These 
were the words of our Savior, and that is enough on that score. But 
our Protestant friends do not even have that much of a claim. They 
have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. And because 
they do not have the authority themselves they think no one else has. 

I have read to you. how the Lord conferred the lesser Priesthood 
upon the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Let me read 
from the 27th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Prophet 
Joseph, in preparing for a sacramental meeting in August, 1830, started 
to go to a neighbor's house to secure wine for the sacrament, because 
that is what had been used. He was met by a messenger from the 
Lord and instructed that he need not go for wine ; that pure water 
should be used instead : 

"It mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partakt 
of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory — 
remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my 
blcod which was shed, for the remission of your sins." 

Then this messenger goes on to tell the prophet that the day will 
come when he, Joseph Smith, would be able to sit down with Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob, with Moses, with Elias, with others of the ancient 
worthies and partake of the sacrament "and also with all those whom 
my Father hath given me out of the world." So, some of us may have 
the privilege of being there. But he said further, that the iProphet 
would have the privilege of sitting down "with Peter, and James, and 
John, whom I 'have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and 
confirmed you to be apostles, and especial witnesses of my name, and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIB LEY 



25 



bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which I revealed 
unto them." 

Here was divine authority in these last days, conferred by holy 
messengers, the same men, Peter, James and John, of whom the Lord 
Jesus Christ said, in his time : "Ye have not chosen me, but I have 
chosen you and ordained you." The Lord Jesus himself ordained those 
three men, and they came, as I have read, and conferred the holy apostle- 
ship upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. So here is divine au- 
thority to act in the name of the Lord. Our claim is that the authority 
of the Priesthood has been conferred upon men and given to this 
Church which is the Church of Christ. It is not given to the nation. 
But the nation has had divine guidance, as I have said. Individuals 
not of our Church may have divine guidance ; but divine authority, to 
act in the name of the Lord, to baptize, to lay on hands, to say : "Re- 
ceive ye the Holy Ghost," as the apostles of old said, and then to have 
them receive it, that is a different proposition. 

WITNESSES OF THE BESTOWAL OF DIVINE AUTHORITY 

Upon these statements of divine authority we rest our case, as the 
lawyers say. If these heavenly messengers did not come to Joseph 
Smith and confer upon him this divine authority, then is our preaching 
vain and our faith is vain also. But we know, and the world may 
know also by the fruits of "Mormonism" that there is divine power in 
this organization. Moreover, we have witnesses. Through Joseph 
Smith the Lord called three special witnesses, to whom was given the 
great manifestation of the truth of the Book of Mormon. We have not 
only three witnesses to the testimony of this divine auhority, but we have 
three hundred thousand of them, and more, that can rise up and testify 
that by the power and influence of the Holy Ghost they know that this 
is the work of God, that it is the power of God unto salvation. It is not 
a form of godliness without any power; it is tJie power of God unto 
salvation, the salvation of all those who will accept it, in this land 
and in every other land. That is the difference between this Church and 
all other .churches in the world. We call upon all the world to know 
that that divine authority is here, in this Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and that it is nowhere else. God bless you. Amen. 

STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

God is in heaven, but he is not- far removed from them that seel« 
him. He is a friend who never fails. One can always trust him. 

THANKS AND GRATITUDF 

I thank God for the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 
for the great conceptions of life which it offers for the comfort and 
the encouragement and the hope of all mankind. 

I thank him for the Church with all its great institutions, -built 
up and maintained under the power of the holy Priesthood for the 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



salvation of the souls of men, and for their direction in the great 
cause of truth. 

I thank God for the Saints, the blessed Saints, who make up 
the Church of Christ, who have testimonies of the divinity of Jesus 
Christ, our Lord and Master ; who know of the great mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and who seek to carry forward the mighty 
work which he was instrumental in establishing. I am grateful 
to be identified with the Saints of God. . i 

I thank God for the Priesthood, for that great power just 
spoken of, a very portion of Godhood itself, which enables men 
to administer the ordinances of the Everlasting Gospel, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, and with his authority. I am grateful for 
the fraternity and the friendship which come from associations in 
the Priesthood. 

I thank God for my brethren of the stakes, where my duties 
call me, for my associations with them, for their uniform kindness 
and consideration and love. Brethren, I love you, I love you in 
the bond of the holy Priesthood, and I trust that that bond may 
always keep us together. ;Thank God for the handclasp of a man 
who is united with me in the Priesthood of God. Never neglect 
those friendships, brethren, be one and you will be Christ's. 

I am grateful, beyond my power of expression, for the com- 
panionship of my beloved brethren who surround me, my col- 
leagues, my true friends, men whose examples stimulate and en- 
courage me and protect me from temptation and error. I am grate- 
ful for their confidence in me, and I have continually prayed that 
in some measure I might be worthy of that confidence. 

The Lord is good. All his judgments are righteous. He makes 
no mistakes. Never complain at the judgments of God; never 
mock him. Always trust him. He will never forsake you. Seek 
the things of eternity; they are worth while. All other things 
are of but passing worth and comparatively valueless. 

Oh, I thank God for the home and for the great conception 
of family which we have, Ifor the eternity of these sacred and 
beautiful relationships that under the power of the Priesthood have 
been established. If there were nothing else given to the world by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith than our great and beautiful conception 
of home and family, he would have made the greatest contribu- 
tion ever made to humanity by any man who has lived. 

I praise his great name, the name of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
I know that his mission was divine. My heart, my soul, and every 
faculty of which I have possession, confirm that knowledge. The 
work that he established is the work of the living God. 

In your presence, humbly, I consecrate and dedicate all that 
has been given to me to the establishment of that work. May we 
all make it prosper as God would have us do, I pray humbly, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish that it were given to all of the audience to stand here 
and see this magnificent sight as we are standing and singing our 
songs. Of course, we get a view that those of you in the audience 
cannot have. This is a wonderful inspiration — to view such an 
audience, the main body of this house full of men holding the Priest- 
hood of God, and the power of Almighty God, to declare his will 
to the world. 

REED SMOOT 

I could do no better than repeat the words that have been spoken 
by President Grant. I had it in my heart to do so, and I want to say 
amen to all that he has just said, also I want to express my appreciation 
for the privilege of attending this general conference. While we were 
singing the last song, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah," 
and the one before, I thought, if the author of these two songs were 
allowed to be present and hear the words sung by this wonderful and 
enthusiastic audience, such an audience as cannot be found in any other 
place on earth, his heart would be filled with joy and praise-giving. The 
fundamentals of the gospel of Jesus Christ are found in the words of 
these two songs. Where else in all the world could you see an audience 
of ten thousand people every one of them capable of quoting every) 
word of the song, and every soul interested in singing the praises to- 
God as contained in these two songs? 

NEVER DESPAIR 

The other day a middle-aged man called to see me. It was about a 
question in which he was deeply interested, and after I advised him 
that his wishes, as far as any action on the part of our government was 
concerned, were useless, he began to talk to me about his life and 
what he had been called upon to sacrifice for the gospel's sake. He 
said that he became almost discouraged and was almost at the road 
of despair. I thought, my brethren and sisters, that that condition, 
if a man reached it, is a most dangerous one, and at that time if 
a word of encouragement or a helping hand could be extended, it 
may save him. I remembered when I was going to school as a 
young boy of being asked to learn and repeat an article found, 
I think, in the National Fifth Reader, entitled "Never Despair," and as 
I had it with me I read it to him. I think, my brethren and 
sisters, that perhaps it would be a proper thing to call it to your 
attention, and I shall do so, in part : 

"There is no trait of human character so potential for weal or woe as 
firmness. To the business man it is all important. Before its irresistable energy 
the most formidable obstacles become as cobweb barriers in its path. Dif- 
ficulties, the terror of which causes the pampered sons of luxury to shrink 
back with dismay, provoke from the man of lofty determination only a smile. 



( , ENERAL CONFERENCE 



The whole story of our race — all nature, indeed — teems with examples to show 
what wenders may be accomplished by resolute perseverance and patient toil. 

"It is related of Tamerlane, the celebrated warrior, the terror of whose arms 
spread through all the eastern nations, and whom victory attended at almost 
every step, that he once learned from an insect a lesson of perseverance, which 
had a striking effect upon his future character and success. 

"When closely pursued by his enemies — as contemporary tells the anecdote 
— he took refuge in some old ruins, where, left to his solitary musings, he espied 
an ant tugging and striving to carry a single grain of corn. His unavailing 1 
efforts were repeated sixty-nine times, and at each several time so soon as he 
reached a certain point of projection, he fell back with his burden, unable to sur- 
mount it; but the seventieth time he bore away his spoil in triumph, and 1'efiJ 
the wondering hero reanimated and exulting in the hope of future victory. 

"How pregnant the lesson this incident conveys ! How many thousand in- 
stances there are in which inglorious defeat ends the career of the timid 'andi 
desponding, when the same tenacity of purpose would crown it with triumphant 
success ! Resolution is almost omnipotent. Sheridan was at first timid and, 
obliged to sit down in the midst of a speech. Convinced of, and mortified at, 
the cause of his failure, he said one day to a friend, 'It is in me, and it shall 
come out' 

"From that moment he arose, and shone, and triumphed in a consummate 
eloquence. Here was true moral courage. And it was well observed by a 
heathen moralist, that it is not because things are difficult that we dare not 
undertake them. 

"Be, then, bold in spirit. Indulge no doubts — they are traitors. In the prac- 
tical pursuit of our high aim, let us never lose sight of it in the slightest in- 
stance : for it is more by a disregard of small things, than by open and flagrant 
offenses, that men come short of excellence. There is always a right and a> 
wrong; and if you ever doubt, be sure you take not the wrong. Observe this! 
rule, and every experience will be to you a means of advancement." 

THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOSPEL IN US MUST COME OUT 

My brethren and sisters, it is in us, it must come out. We 
have the testimony in our souls that Jesus is the Christ, that 
Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the living God, that God, 
through him, established this Church in this dispensation, never- 
more to be thrown down or given to another people. As I looked 
at the f aces of this vast audience of the priesthood before me, I 
wondered if there is made that determined effort for success, 
that firmness maintained that is so essential to success in every 
vocation of life, and in their belief in any principle; that if it were, 
what could not be accomplished. I am not afraid of the ultimate 
success of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. God 
is at the helm. I can see every year that passes by, step by step, 
it is gaining its way and men are studying the results of it ; men 
who hold mighty positions, men of affairs. While, of course, they 
have not the knowledge that it was from God, they can't but 
look at the results of it, and they can't but see there is some- 
thing in the gospel of Jesus Christ greater than mere numbers of 
souls. If we are faithful, if we are true to the covenants that wQ 
have made with God, if we have, an eye single to his glory, if wa 
think more of God's work and its success than of our own in-i 
dividual success, or our own individual positions in this world, I 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



29 



say to you now that the gospel of Jesus Christ will grow just as fast 
as God wants it to grow, ,or knows that the people are ready for 
it to grow. 

PREJUDICES NOT ALL ELIMINATED 

The prejudices against our people that have been so bitter in 
the past are not all eliminated yet. Perhaps they never will be 
until final success comes, but I want to testify to you that this 
wall of prejudice is crumbling, it is being destroyed in the minds 
of the opposition when they see the results of "Mormonism" in 
the community in which "Mormons" live, and I haven't any doubt, 
my brethren and sisters, that the final triumph of the work of God 
will come in his own due time. I thank God for his Spirit made 
manifest to us this day. My heart gave echo to all that has been 
said, and I am, with my brethren, interested in the advancement of 
the Church that it may spread to all the four corners of the earth, 
that the testimony of the elders shall be heard in all lands. 

A WEALTH OF SPIRITUALITY AND FAITH 

I wondered when we were singing the last song if every per- 
son in the world could have heard it — and that time may c'ome 
when they can do so, if they desire — what effect it would have 
had upon them. 1 know that no stranger, no man, could have 
been in this building today and heard the song that was sung and 
the power that was manifested by every one who took part in the 
singing and not have been touched to the heart. He never 
could have said there is not faith among the people known 
as the "Mormons." He never could have claimed that there was 
not a wealth of spirituality and faith emanating from those who 
have taken part in the singing and speaking, both would have im- 
pressed him with the earnestness and with the truthfulness of the 
words that were sung and the testimonies of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ as proclaimed. 

GOD LIVES AND THIS IS HIS CHURCH 

My brethren and sisters, I want to leave with you today that 
testimony for which I prayed so long. My mother said if I would 
keep myself unspotted from the sins of the world it would come, 
and this is that testimony, that I know that God lives and this is 
his Church. I hope, as long as I have breath, that whatever is re- 
quired of me as a servant of God, I shall be perfectly willing to do, 
to make sacrifice of any name or nature, even unto life itself; and 
if a humble prayer, offered to my heavenly Father morning and 
night, will keep me in that same frame of mind, I shall glorify his 
name and thank my Maker for that testimony. 

May God's choicest blessings be with his people. May they 
increase in wisdom, and may their works be such that the world 
seeing them will concede that they are directed from other sources 
than man, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

RICHARD R. LYMAN 

We believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet; that Joseph Smith 
is a prophet ; and that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, through him, 
has been re-established upon the earth. 

BEAUTY, POWER AND GLORY OF THE CHURCH 

In this Church organization, as I see it, there is every element that 
will make people stronger, better and happier, and I am of the opinion, 
at times, that we ourselves, who are the living elements of this great 
Church, do not comprehend its beauty, its power and its glory. 

ADDRESSES AT THE OFFICER'S MEETING, Y. M. M. I. A. 

We had a meeting of the officers of the Young Men's Mutual 
Improvement Associations of the Church, in the 'Bishop's Building, this 
morning at 8 o'clock. We listened to addresses given by four of 
our ninety-six Y. M : . M. I. A. stake superintendents. We have 
one stake superintendent in each of the ninety-six stakes of the . 
Church. 

These superintendents are but young men. I wish all of you 
could have heard the four who spoke this morning. They stood before 
that great group of Mutual Improvement workers like generals at the 
head of an army. 

I was so profoundly impressed by the scripture which one of these 
speakers quoted that I am going to read it to you : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the 
children of men." (Doc. and Cov. 4:1.) 

This, the L. D. S. Church, is that marvelous work. And the more 
I study it, the more marvelous things I find in it. 

MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE 

The whole Christian world is pretty generally agreed, I believe, 
that there is hardly a more important element in the teachings and in 
the example of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ than that expressed 
by the Apostle Paul when he said : "Remember the words of the Lord 
Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than it is to receive." 
(Acts 20:35.) 

Measured by this matchless measuring stick given by the Lord 
Jesus Christ, the L. D. S. Church is marvelous. In all the world 
there is no other institution which, in proportion to its size, has 
in it so many volunteer workers, or so many who contribute so lavishly, 
of both time and money, as do its members, into whose souls has come 
the conviction, as a result of faith, prayer and righteous living, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that by obedience to the laws and ordinances of 
the gospel men may be saved, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet. 
Match if you can in any other organization anywhere the unselfishness 
of our army of two thousand missionaries who preach the gospel, as 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



31 



we believe it, in nearly every quarter of the globe without money and 
without price. These not only give their time to this great cause, but 
they pay their own expenses. 

OUR VOLUNTEER WORKERS IN THE CHURCH 

It is not, however, of the missionaries abroad, but of the volunteer 
workers at home that I desire to speak on this occasion. 

Each of these ninety-six stake superintendents of the Y. M. 
M. I. A. has two counselors, a stake secretary, and when completely 
organized at least five other stake board members. To each one of 
these board members is assigned the chairmanship of a specific com- 
mittee. Thus in all the Church we have in the Young Men's Mutual 
Improvement organization in the neighborhood of a thousand stake 
officers. We have in addition about five officers for each ward, or 
approximately four thousand ward officers. There are therefore in 
the Young Men's organization as stake and ward officers approximately 
five thousand men. 

Since the Young Men's organization is but one of the five aux- 
iliary organizations of the Church, and, further, since the other or- 
ganizations probably have approximately the same number of officers 
as has the Y. jM. M. I. A., this means that throughout the Church 
we have approximately twenty-five thousand officers in these auxiliary 
organizations. Twenty-five thousand volunteer workers ! Where else 
in all the world can such another volunteer group be found? These 
are struggling for the good of humanity without any hope of reward, 
except the satisfaction which comes from living -in accordance with 
that Christian principle that it is more blessed to give than to receive. 
The L. D. S. Church is the marvelous work referred to which has come 
forth among the children of men. 

Let me make it clear that I am not now speaking of the Church 
organization proper. I am not referring to the presidents of stakes 
and bishops of wards and the presiding officers of the various quorums 
of the priesthood. The twenty-five thousand officers I refer to, are 
serving in our auxiliary organizations, and these are but helps in 
the government of the Church, they do not constitute the main 
Church organization. 

MISSIONARY WORK IN THE Y. M. M. I. A. 

But let me refer further to the remarks of our Mutual Improve- 
ment superintendents who spoke at our 8 o'clock meeting this morning. 
Another of the four speakers outlined the plan of work which he and 
the other volunteer workers of his stake propose to carry out. He 
reported progress regarding the Y. M. M. I. A. card record. His 
remarks were somewhat like this : "In our stake the organization for 
doing missionary work is practically complete. We have prepared a 
card for all the male members of our ward between the ages of twelve 
and thirty. If one of these, in any ward of our stake, does not attend 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our Mutual Improvement meetings, our plan is to have him visited at 
leasl once each month. These cards are already in the hands of our 
missionaries. On the hack of the card, which contains the name of 
the individual visited, the, visitor will record his own name, the datf of 
his visit and any comments concerning this individual case which may 
seem necessary." 

Thus we propose in this Young Men's organization, to reach every 
boy in every ward, however poor, however unfortunate that hoy may 
he. We expect to extend the helping hand to the boy who, for any 
reason whatever, may Ik- required to fight a difficult or an unfair fight. 
Each and every month we propose to "visit the fatherless in their 
afflictions," and with the help of divine Providence keep all young 
men in every part of the Church "unspotted from the world." (James 
1:2?.) 

Let me explain further what we expect to do with these young 
men, if the missionaries succeed in bringing them to the meetings of 
our organization. If you have a son who is careless, we are going to 
try to make him serious and industrious. If your neighbor has a son 
wiio is careless, we propose to do the same thing with him also. 
Wherever we find a boy who is not interested in study, we hope to 
arouse within him an interest in his school work. Where we find boys 
who are living in idleness, it is our aim to encourage them to be 
ambitions and to go to work. If we find a boy who is a spendthrift, 
we aim to impress upon him lessons of frugality. We^aim to teach 
young men to stand erect, to step with the elastic step, to practice the 
teachings of the Scout organization, to be true to God and to country, 
to help other people at all times, to keep themselves physically strong, 
mentally awake, and morally straight. In short, we are struggling to 
make these Mutual Improvement members perfect, even as our Father 
in heaven is perfect. 

LABORS OF GENERAL BOARD MEMBERS 

We have, as members of our General Board, those who have had 
extensive scientific training. We have among them men who are 
teachers, men who are experts in psychology. Many of our General 
Board members are products of the best schools of our country. 
Unitedly these Hoard Members have prepared a program for young 
men so broad that we hope to be able with it to reach and touch ef- 
fectively the life of any man's son, whatever may be the qualifications 
of that son. 

PROGRAM OF INSTRUCTION IN THE M. I. A. 

( hir program is so varied that we expect some portion of it 
will appeal to something in the life of every boy. And with these 
numerous activities our plan and hope and expectation is that we 
shall lie able to give to every boy at least enough religion, enough in- 
formation concerning the teachings and the love and the example of 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

Jesus the Son of God, to fill him with genuine ambition and to keep 
him walking in paths of virtue. 1 

If a young man is interested in debate, we are providing an oppor- 
tunity for him to express that impulse. If he is interested in dramatics, 
here he will find an opportunity to give expression to his natural 
fondness for playing" the part of another. If, perhaps, he has a 
natural interest in music, opportunity will be provided in our Mutual 
Improvement program for him to give expression to this musical urge 
or impulse. Whatever his aim, his desire, his ambition, we are aiming 
to provide in our Mutual Improvement organization an opportunity 
for him to express it. 

We give to our Mutual Improvement members lessons in honesty. 
We teach them to be true, to be chaste, to be benevolent. We teach 
them that we believe in doing good to all men at all times. We teach 
them, in the language of the Doctrine and Covenants, to "Remember 
faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, 
godliness, charity, humility, diligence." (Doc. and Cov. 4:6,) 

These, the fundamental elements in the gospel of Jesus Christ — 
these are the doctrines and principles and practices we are aiming to 
bring into the lives^of the young people of the Church. We desire to 
.have them, by keeping the commandments, receive as a part of their 
lives, their very beings, that something, that unexplainable something, 
that came into the life of Saul of Tarsus. It was a light from heaven, 
but it touched his life, it touched his soul, it transformed a heart of 
hate into a heart of love. It transformed Saul of Tarsus into Paul the 
apostle. It is the aim of our organization in the teachings of this year 
so to train our young folks that they may know as Job knew when he 
said: "I know that my Redeemer liveth." (Job. 19:25.) When 
we are teaching them to live that prayerful life, that life of faith, we are 
teaching them to practice that righteous living which brings into human 
hearts that knowledge for which we seek, that knowledge we desire 
all our young folks to have ; namely, a conviction that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that Joseph Smith is his prophet. 

I shall conclude with the words from the Doctrine and Covenants 
which one of our superintendents used this morning : 

"O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart,- might, mind and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day." (Doc. and Cov. 4:2.) The 
Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to read a few verses from 
the 26th chapter of II Nephi, beginning with the 23rd verse, as 
follows : 

THE GOSPEL UNIVERSAL 

"For behold, my beloved brethren, T say unto you that the Lord worketh no* 
in darkness. 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"He doeth not anything save it he for the benefit of the world; for ht 
loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all 
men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake 
of his salvation. 

"Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say 
unto you, Nay; but he saith : Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk 
and honey, without money and without price. 

"Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the syna- 
gogues, or out of the houses of worship ? Behold, I say unto you, Nay. 

"Hath he commanded any that they should, not partake of his salvation? 
Behold I say unto you, Nay; but Ihe hath given it free for all men; and he 
hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance. 

"Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of 
his goodness? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the 
one like unto the ether, and none are forbidden." 

I read now from the 33rd verse: 

"For the Lord doeth that which is good among the children of men; and 
he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth 
them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none 
that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he 
remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile." 

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING 

It has been my privilege in association with my companions, 
Brothers Rulpn S. Wells and Rey L. Pratt, during the past year 
to come to a better understanding of the Lord's feeling towards his 
sons and daughters, as expressed in this scripture that I have just 
read to you. As you have heard, we were assigned to go as the 
first missionaries of the Church to South America. 

FIRST MISSIONARY VISIT IN SOUTH AMERICA 

However, you students of our history will remember that 
Bother Parley P. Pratt made a visit to the west coast of that coun- 
try about seventy years ago. He remained for a few months, until 
his means were exhausted, struggling with the Spanish language. 
He was not so fortunate as we were, because we had his grand- 
son, Brother Rey L. Pratt, who is a master of the Spanish language. 
That enabled us to do a work that Brother Parley was unable 
to do. Then I am also sure that there has been going forward 
in South America, in these last seventy years, a marvelous change 
that was necessary to prepare the hearts of the people and the 
governments for the coming of the gospel message. We knew, 
however, that it was not going to be easy, but we were willing 
to go to the ends of the earth, to make any kind of sacrifice, to 
discharge the great obligation which the Lord has placed upon 
his Church, to bring to all men the glad news that he has spoken 
again, and has established his Church in the earth, that all flesh, 
black and white, bond and free, Jew and Gentile, all may know 
of these good things which the Lord has done.

RECENT MISSIONARY WORK IN SOUTH AMERICA 

We took a long journey into that south land — and, by the way, 
there were some who wondered why we did not go to San 
Franscisco and sail to South America from that point, but if you 
will look up the map and draw a line straight south from New,. 
York City, your line will carry you about two hundred miles west 
of Valparaiso, on the coast of Chile. So practically all of South 
America lies east of New York City. We sailed from New York 
City on the 14th day of November, and after six days and six! 
nights we reached one of the islands of the West Indies. We felt 
sure that we were a long distance from home. We might have 
been in Europe by that time. Then we sailed nine days and nine 
nights without seeing land, and then found ourselves opposite the 
eastern point of South America, and not many hundred miles west 
of the British Isles. Then three days more and we were into the 
harbor at Rio de Janeiro, off the coast of Brazil. Then five days 
more and we reached our destination at Buenos Aires, the great 
^southern capital, a city of two million two hundred fifty thousand 
people. I said to some of the brethren that it was a strange expe- 
rience as we passed out of New York City in a cold winter's wind, 
to go into the balmy summer climate of South America, where 
summer there is winter here ; to pass under the equator and have 
the sun move off to the north and arise in the northeast and set 
in the northwest and the moon to follow likewise ; and all the stars 
we knew to disappear, and a new heaven and a new earth came 
into view, for it was a different kind of earth from ours, different 
vegetation, climate, people, and to me a different language, until 
I felt like one entirely removed from the world I knew. I am 
grateful, that we had Brother Pratt's assistance in speaking the 
Spanish ; and Brother Wells' assistance in speaking the German, 
for we had two families of German-speaking people in Buenos 
Aires who had joined the Church in Germany. With Brother 
Wells' assistance we succeeded in carrying the work forward 
among the German-speaking people of that section, and before 
Brother Wells had to return it was our privilege to take six of 
them into the waters of baptism, the first converts baptized in 
South America. Brother Wells' return was a great sorrow to us 
because of his companionship and his knowledge of the German 
language, but his illness was such, and it continued to recur, 
that we felt his life was in danger. He was an exceedingly sick 
man, and yet Brother Wells would have been glad to have stayed 
there and laid down his life. It was a great disappointment to us 
to have him go home, but it was necessary, and he was willing to 
respond to the suggestion and as cheerfully go as to stay. 

Then Brother Pratt and myself continued our work with the 
German people as best we could, but it was difficult. I had to 
tell Brother Pratt in English what to tell them, and he told it 
in the Spanish to a German girl who could speak a little Spanish. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



She interpreted it in German to our friends, and the answer came 
hack in the same grapevine way. But we were successful in hold- 
ino- them and in increasing interest among others until our little 
.■roup erew. When Brother Stoof reached us, being a master of 
the German language, he was able to take up that work and push 
it forward, so that it is in a very prosperous condition today. There 
are a number of others who have become interested. 

DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED 

The principal work that Brother Pratt and myself undertook 
was among the Spanish-speaking people, and I would like you to 
know that Spanish is the language of South America. While there 
are here and there small groups of English and small groups of 
German-speaking people, practically all of them speak Spanish. 
So that one is as helpless down there without Spanish as he would 
be in the United States without English. We undertook to secure 
a hall, |but there were no halls such as we have in this country. 
Conditions are different. When we did try to rent some of them, 
we could not secure them because they were recreation halls, and 
the chief activities were going forward on Sunday night, and they 
did not .Wish a religious service to disturb them. So for two 
months we battled with that problem. We tried to rent office 
quarters to make halls out of them, but were unsuccessful. 

At last we did secure a place and rented all of it, a store and 
living quarters, and then we began to invite people to come. In 
the meantime, however, we had gone to our friends who live in 
the suburbs or outskirts of the city. That was not the easiest 
work to do, because we traveled two hours on the street car and 
then walked two miles, not on paved streets, but on lanes, through 
fields, in mud, in dust, and all character of weather, and then when 
we did this all we could get to come to our meetings, for nearly 
two months, were children. 

"a little child shall lead them" . • 

There was no prejudice against us, in fact the great majority 
of the people did not even know there was a United States of 
North America or anything about it, much less did they know any- 
thing about the "Mormon" Church. 'The chief lack of interest was 
because we were not Catholic. The whole country is Catholic, 
as you know. Nevertheless we said: "We shall not abandon our 
effort to reach the people." And we learned anew that "a little 
child shall lead them." We continued with those children, teaching 
them to sing, teaching them to pray, to repeat the Lord's prayer, 
the Articles of Faith, and the Ten Commandments. They carried 
these prayers and songs into their homes, and then one .parent 
appeared, and another, and another, and we finally organized a 
group meeting of adults, and continued to teach the children. 
The children brought their parents- — and that was true in several 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



37 



places that had opened for us. Then we moved forward into homes 
of those who had become interested, and to our great joy we saw 
that the same wonderful response was being manifest in the hearts 
of the people of that land as elsewhere, and a splendid Spanish 
woman, came forward and signified her absolute conviction that 
we had brought the truth. She resisted all kinds of opposition that 
was arrayed against her, and it was our privilege to bring her into 
the fold of Christ. I want to bear witness that there is not in the 
Church anywhere a more devoted, faithful Latter-day Saint than 
Sister Sifuentes, in the city of Buenos Aires. I am therefore moved 
to say that I do believe that the Lord is no respecter of persons 
or of nations, and that all who will receive him and his message 
shall likewise have equal privileges in his blessed gospel. She 
became an active and energetic missionary. 

ITALIANS INTERESTED IN THE RESTORED GOSPEL 

Then some Italians became interested. There are two million 
of them in the Republic of Argentina. When our assistants came, 
Brother Stoof and his wife, Brother Sharp and Brother Stoddard, 
splendid workers, we introduced them into those places where we 
had started meetings, and our largest group increased until we 
had an average attendance of about sixty adults. We left them 
with places for meetings every night in the week, except Saturday 
night, and three places on Sunday. We left a small group con- 
verted, for eleven of them signified to us their intention of joining 
the Church and bore testimony to the truth of the message wei 
had brought them. When we finally did leave, there were as many 
tears shed at our departure in Buenos Aires as there had been in 
Salt Lake City when we left here a year ago. Since leaving that 
land four splendid Italians, three men and a woman, have joined 
the Church, and others in addition to the eleven that I have referred 
to have become interested. 

It was a long, hard fight for us. I have no word of censure 
for the people. They had prejudices against the religion we were 
advocating because it was not Catholic. We were foreigners and 
strangers to them. But I rejoice in saying to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that God was good to us and he opened the door so that 
ultimately we had the privilege of laying the foundation of the 
Church in that land, and from a membership of four adults, 
when we reached that land, we have left twenty-four Latter-day 
Saints, with the work started in those three languages.- We met 
no opposition, as far as the government is concerned, notwith- 
standing there is a union of church and state in all the So'uth Ameri- 
can republics, save Chile. There was a separation of church and 
state in Chile a year ago. Yet there is religious liberty in all 
those countries for our missionary work. 

A DIFFICULT MISSIONARY WORK 

I found great difficulty in fully satisfying myself, because of my 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



inability to preach the gospel to them through not knowing their 
language ; however, I learned to read it and converse with the peo- 
ple. T satisfied myself in part, however, by assisting in the splendid 
work that Brother Pratt was performing, by inviting the people to 
our meetings, and having him translate into Spanish the testimony 
I wanted to bear to the people of that land. I had the privilege of 
visiting twelve thousand five hundred homes, giving them this 
printed message and inviting the people to our meetings. We held 
two hundred thirty-four meetings, so that Brother Pratt was very 
busy preaching to the people. We enjoyed the experience, al- 
though we had to do things just like- we did when we started out 
in the commencement of our missionary work, like we did when 
we traveled without purse or scrip. It was the most difficult 
piece of missionary work that I have undertaken, but I thank the 
Lord that success has come out of it, that a foundation has been 
laid, and I am convinced that it is possible for the gospel to be 
carried to all the people of that land. 

VISIT TO THE INDIANS ON THE GREAT ANDES PLATEAU 

It was our privilege, through the permission of the Presidency, 
to return via the West coast. We were anxious not to go away 
from South America until we had seen the Indians of that land. 
So in the Northern part of the Argentina we met them, hundreds 
of thousands of them. We passed up to the plateau of the great 
Andes mountains, a plateau five hundred miles long by a hundred 
and fifty miles wide, at an elevation of twelve thousand feet, in- 
habited by Indians. We lived for some three weeks with them, slept 
in their houses, ate at their tables, saw millions of them. There 
are two million eight 'hundred sixty thousand people in the Republic 
of Bolivia, nearly two million of them being pure-blood Indians. 
There are four million six hundred twenty thousand people in 
Peru, and more than three million and a half of them are pure- 
blood Indians. There are two classes of Indians. One is the half- 
breed, a descendant of the Spanish soldier, and the majority of the 
leaders of South American countries have Indian blood in them, 
but unfortunately they do not esteem that Indian blood, but are 
rather more proud of their Spanish blood. Not until the day shall 
come when they come to an understanding of who they are, and 
that the Indian blood is of Israel and is of the best blood in the 
world, will their hearts turn in sympathy and love to the down- 
trodden and oppressed of their own brothers and sisters, the full- 
blood Indians. 

CONDITION OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN INDIANS 

I have never seen a more industrious, hard-working lot of 
people in my life than the millions of Indians we saw in Bolivia and 
Peru. My heart went out to them in anxious desire, for I saw 
them as they are in Mexico, in poverty, robbed of their lands and 
their glorious civilization, a much better civilization than was 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



39 



brought by Pizarro. A better civilization than they have in those 
countries was destroyed ruthlessly, and they were murdered, and 
their lands taken. They were despoiled and have been trodden 
down and have remained very largely in a state of semi-slavery 
until today. With all their toil and labor they ought to be a rich 
and independent people, if they could only have the returns that 
come from their labor. But the majority of the returns are taken 
by the land holders, for fifteen per cent of the men in South 
America own ninety-five per cent of the land, and these conditions 
have obtained for many years, until they are in a state of poverty, 
and yet they are in the majority in many of those countries. 
But the right of suffrage is only extended to those who can read 
and write, and the majority of the Indians cannot read or write. 
Few schools are provided for them to learn to read and write, and 
they are like a great sleeping giant. Many of them ispeak the 
Spanish language. So Brother Pratt and I cannot see why the 
missionary work shall not quickly come unto them. 

THE DAY OF THE INDIANS' REDEMPTION DRAWING NIGH 

It was our privilege to call on the government officials of 
both Bolivia and Peru, and to explain our mission and desire to! 
have missionaries go to those lands. We were assured that our 
missionaries would be welcome, and that there would be no ob- 
jection on the part of the Government. It is our desire that those 
precious promises made to their forefathers shall be fulfilled. They 
shall pass through the same changes that are going forward in 
Mexico, but they shall come out of their serfdom and bondage into 
the light of freedom in religious, as well as in political matters, 
and the day of retribution and their redemption, I am sure, is 
not far distant. 

SPAIN AND ITALY ENTITLED TO HEAR THE GOSPEL 

I desire to bear testimony to what President Ivins said here 
this morning. ,1 believe that the beginning of this gospel dis- 
pensation, as set forth in one of these revelations, was the com- 
mencement of the times of the Gentiles. I believe that that gen- 
eration which saw the dawn of this gospel dispensation shall not 
pass away until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled, and after 
the days of the Gentiles cometh the day of Israel. I am anxious, 
therefore, that in the period which yet remains to the Gentile na- 
tions to hear the gospel message, we shall send forth the help nec- 
essary, not only to those South American countries,, but my soul 
has been turned towards Spain, since I have been in that South 
land, and also toward Italy. I do not feel we are justified in the 
opportunity we have given to either Spain or Italy or France or 
China or to other nations to hear the gospel ; so I am looking 
forward for the time to come in the very near future when those 
lands shall be fully given the opportunity. Not many of them 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



may come into the fold, and yet I believe that there is some of' 
the blood of Israel in Spain and in Italy, and that the people are en- 
titled to the opportunity of hearing- the gospel before the day of 
judgment shall come. I bear witness to you that the Lord is al- 
ready beginning the work for the redemption of the house of Israel. 

THE GOSPEL TO DELIVER THE CHILDREN OF FATHER LEHI FROM BONDAGE 

God gave us the Book of Mormon and the chief reason, as 
set forth in one of the revelations, is that it shall be the means 
of bringing to the descendants of Father Lehi the knowledge of 
the Redeemer of the world, and to establish them in the faith of 
their fathers. I bear witness to you that nothing on earth shall 
ever bring them out of their thraldom save the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I rejoice, therefore, that the day dawn is breaking, 
the night is dispelling and the day of their redemption cometh. I 
have wept over them, as I have seen them dwelling in ignorance 
and poverty in the midst of the ruins of great and glorious cities 
their fathers built. Such ruins I have never seen elsewhere of 
mighty temples and cities, the evidence of their past wonderful 
civilization ; and then, as I looked upon these poor, wretched souls 
who have reached their state of degredation, of poverty and misery, 
through sin, transgression and oppression, I have prayed to God to 
bring to pass their deliverance according to his promises, and I feel 
sure that that day is at hand. May the Lord put it into the hearts 
of men and women to continue to respond and carry the gospel mes- 
sage wherever it is wanted, and discharge the mighty responsi- 
bility that rests upon this Church before the day of judgment shall 
come, that the Gentile dispensation, when it comes to a close, will 
find us having discharged our obligation; then cometh the day of 
Israel, the day of her redemption in all lands.- I bear witness to 
you that swiftly moving events are at our very doors. I bear 
witness that God is crying repentance to the world in the testi- 
monies of thunder, of lightning and tempests, and if they do not 
repent he will thresh the nations. 

THE TASK AND DUTY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

There is no safety, so far as the Latter-day Saints are con- 
cerned, only by keeping the commandments of God. As I looked 
at the Church from the distance of eleven thousand miles, I admired 
what we have done in subduing the desert and making it blossom 
ike the rose, building our temples, tabernacles, and factories; 
but rising above them all and more splendid and glorious than 
all else is the manhood and the womanhood that has been estab- 
lished in the earth by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. It is the biggest thing we have done, and may God help us 
to use all we have or may possess as but a means to the glorious 
end of establishing here a civilization the like of which the world 
does not know ; that they may come from the East and the West,

from the North and the South, to learn of our ways and to walk 
in our paths. It is our task to perfect the lives of these men and 
women, boys and girls, until they shall be the light of the world, 
the salt of the earth. God give us the vision to see it, to work' 
until we shall be successful, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

TABERNACLE CHOIR VISITS CALIFORNIA 

About the first of July members of the choir numbering 250 took 
an excursion to California^ where they gave a series of fine con- 
certs. The expense incurred was approximately $12,000. All of 
this amount except $991.25 was paid from the receipts of the con- 
certs given. The balance was paid out of the treasury of the choir, 
it being their proportion of receipts from concerts given locally 
prior to that time. 

Credit should be given the authorities and members of the Los 
Angeles stake for helping to make this trip a success, for they all 
gave of their time, and were enthusiastic in their efforts to have 
the people of Los Angeles and surrounding territory hear the choir. 

The choir is worthy of the support of all the people who 
hear it so often, but when they give a concert many of us do not 
feel the moral obligation, as well as the small financial obligation, 
to assist the choir by attending their concerts. 

PETER WHITMER FARM PURCHASED 

President Brigham H. Roberts was authorized to purchase, and 
succeeded in purchasing, the Peter Whitmer Farm, where the or- 
ganization of the Church took place. The deal has been closed, and 
we are now the owners of the building where the Church was 
legally organized. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Worthy is the Lamb." 
The closing' prayer was offered by Elder George Albert Smith, of 
the Council of the Twelve. 

The conference adjourned until Monday, 10 o'clock a. m., October 

4. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 



An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, October 3, 1926. 

Elder Charles H. Hart, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The singing" was furnished by the Tenth ward choir of Salt Lake 
City, Elder Norman Martin conducting ; Elder Tracy Y. Cannon, 
organist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah," after which the choir sang an anthem, "Loyalty." 

Prayer was offered by Elder David R. Lyon, of the Ensign ward, 
Salt Lake City. 

The choir sang the anthem, "As the dew from heaven distilling;" 
Sister Mary Salt, soloist. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, it is a pleasure for me to 
be with you tills morning. I regret that we can not be in the 
Tabernacle where we could listen to the opening address of our Presi- 
dent, for no doubt we shall miss something through not having that 
privilege; yet jl am sure that if we have faith, desiring the blessings 
of the Lord, we shall be blessed with his Spirit and shall have a time 
of rejoicing here. 

As I looked upon the great throng as they were making their way 
early this morning to find seats in the Tabernacle or in this building, I 
remarked to Bishop Cannon that they were showing their faith by 
their works. The fact that so many will come out in a rain storm 
such as we have this morning, making the atmosphere so disagreeable, 
shows that these people here hope to be fed the bread of life; and 
I sincerely pray that those who are assembled will not go away hungry, 
and that the Lord will bless me while I address you and will give me 
strength and wisdom to speak to you words of truth and encourage- 
ment. We have all, no doubt, discovered that there is always more to 
be gained through personal contact with the speaker than through read- 
ing his addresses alone, for personal contact enables us to catch the 
spirit of the remarks better than can be done through the written word. 
This may explain why so many are willing to face wind and rain to 
be Where they can hear the words of those whom God has chosen and 
whom we sustain as our leaders, for they are anxious to receive that 
spiritual food which comes to those who attend such gatherings, hungry 
for spiritual food. Each individual may test for himself the Savior's 
words: "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteous- 
ness : for they shall be filled." What a wonderful privilege it is to par- 
take of this spiritual uplift which brings us together in one great cause! 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

I found an interesting example of this during the latter part of 
July. I was called, by the First Presidency of the Church, to take charge 
of an excursion of the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir to California. It 
was a pleasure to accompany them ( and help to look after them, although 
a strenuous undertaking. The Choir train carried more than three 
hundred fifty people, two hundred fifty of whom were choir mem- 
bers. They gave nine concerts in ten clays and traveled every night 
but one. During the trip each member seemed <to have a desire to make 
the most favorable impression upon the people, both in their singing and 
in their conduct, which was above criticism. Through the help of 
President McCune, of the Los Angeles stake, and his associates, Presi- 
dent McMurrin, of the California mission, and the missionaries labor- 
ing under him, we were received cordially and had full houses wherever 
concerts were given. This enabled us to return home, having paid our 
expenses through the receipts from these concerts and from others given 
at 'home prior to our departure. 

On the way, and before we entered the city of Sacramento, an 
official of the Chamber of Commerce of that city boarded the train, 
and, coming to the car where I was, he said, "Bishop Smith, I have 
come up here because I desire to talk to you concerning matters which 
we consider important and I knew I could not have much of your time 
when you arrive in Sacramento. It is my business to look after the 
Tourists' Department and the Colonization Department of the Sacra- 
mento Chamber of Commerce and the development of the Sacramento 
Valley. After studying the situation carefully, -we jhave decided to 
request that your Church give us a stake organization in this district." 
I asked him whether or not he was a member of the Church, although I 
did not think he was, for when he boarded the train he was smoking a 
cigar. He answered, "No, I am not a member of the Church." Then 
I asked, "What do you know about a stake organization ?" His answer 
was, "I know that it is impossible to get your people to gather in one 
place in any great numbers unless they have an organization to keep 
them at work and supply their spiritual needs, and we want to fill this 
valley with Latter-day Saints. 

"Years ago," he said, "settlers in this valley started to get the water 
out upon the land. Among these settlers were a few 'Mormon' families. 
The first year these people failed, and their crops failed, and many of the 
settlers moved away. The next year they continued their work and 
planted their crops, but were not successful in getting sufficient water 
to save all of them, and still more of the people moved away. The 
'Mormons' stayed and continued digging ditches to provide a means 
of getting water on to the land. They worked with one another and for 
one another, divided their substance, and helped one another in every 
way, that all might succeed. They showed none of the spirit of selfish- 
ness commonly found, and were filled with hope that they should event- 
ually succeed and make prosperous homes for themselves. The next 
year they succeeded and put water on to the land, and their ground 
became productive, a garden spot in a desert ; and those who had moved 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



away, and others who had come in to look and see what had been 
done,' were encouraged. Then men with money, seeing what had been 
accomplished, and having dreams of what might be accomplished, 
came in with their money, and the result is that the Sacramento Valley 
is today the best watered valley in California." 

I have not verified that statement, but the thing of interest to me 
is that this man and many others have discovered a principle that is a 
fundamental doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints : That to succeed we must cooperate one with another, we must 
help one another, we must set aside all feeling of selfishness which is 
found in all the world in this day, and we must have an interest in 
our brother and render assistance to him whenever it is possible to do 
so, whether that assistance be temporal or spiritual ; and this 'help should 
be rendered in the spirit of love and good fellowship, following the 
teachings of the Savior. This spirit must be manifest in great abund- 
ance before Zion can be finally redeemed, for Zion is to be redeemed 
only when the people keep the celestial law ; and this ,is a state prepar- 
atory to the coming of our Lord and Savior to establish his kingdom 
in the earth. 

Down there in California men whose only interest is to make 
money, and who are seeking to bring settlers in upon their land, for the 
main purpose of bringing" wealth to them and their communities, see a 
way of capitalizing this principle, a principle which I believe many Lat- 
ter-day Saints have not fully discovered, although it is a dominating 
factor in their success. In order to succeed, we must have the spirit 
of this ,work, and when I say we must have the spirit of this work, I 
mean the God-given power of discernment which keeps before us the 
vision of eternal life ; and unless we serve God we cannot possess this 
spirit, and the nearer we draw to him, the more this spirit is felt. Hav- 
ing discovered this, his servants find that strength that comes- from 
personal contact with one another and through hearing the word. This 
is, no doubt, one reason w'hy so many have gathered here today, in spite 
of the storm, to hear the wx>rd of the Lord. It is what causes them to 
stay where they can serve God as he has commanded them to do. One 
of the apostles of old has stated in I Corinthians 3:13-19: 

"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, 
because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man's work of 
what sort it is. 

"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive 
a reward. 

"If any man's wcrk shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself 
shall be saved ; yet so as by fire. 

"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God 
dwelleth in you? 

"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy ; for the temple 
of God is holy, which temple ye are. 

"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise 
in this world,, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 

"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, 
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness." 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

We see how those Latter-day Saints in California referred to were 
tried, how their work was revealed, how their success came through 
the spirit of cooperation and unselfishness, just as the pioneers who 
settled this valley performed their work in unselfishness, and whose 
sufferings and hardships were tempered with songs of thanksgiving and 
praise ,to their God, for through their faith and their works they hoped 
to get a reward, perhaps not in this life, but surely in the life to come. 

Man may easily deceive himself, and say in his heart, "There is 
no God." He may see no injurious effects irorn contaminating his 
body through mental debauchery or physical contamination, and "Why 
should God interfere?" they may ask. Members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, who have received the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, should have no trouble in answering these questions, for they 
believe their bodies to be the temples of the living God and that his 
Spirit dwells within only when that dwelling place is clean and made 
fit to house that spirit. 

We have recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants the revelation 
known as the Word of Wisdom. It was not given as a commandment 
or by constraint, "but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing 
forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all Saints 
in the last days — 

"Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all Saints, who are or can be called Saints." 

Since this time, it has been accepted as a revelation and made 
binding upon the Church. When first given, it seemed revolutionary 
in its nature, but now, after ninety-three years we find leaders in health 
movements and physical culturists advocating these principles. They 
mean more to us than to others, for they look only for physical strength 
to enable them to enjoy life. We add to that a desire to make of our 
bodies fit dwelling places for the Spirit of God which, when possessed, 
brings joy unmatched by physical strength alone. Time will not permit 
me to dwell at length on the many wonderful promises made in this 
revelation. I am, therefore, referring only to the use of tobacco and 
strong drinks : 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last 
days, I have warned ycu, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word, 
of wisdom by revelation — 

"That inasmuch as any man drinkcth wine or strong drink among you, behold 
it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling 
yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 

"And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the 
vine of your own make. 

"And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of 
your bodies. 

"And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with 
judgment and skill." 

It may seem strange, but nevertheless is a fact, that men who use 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tobacco or liquor soon lose the spirit of Church work. Let me give you 
an example of what I mean: . 

The other day I met a young man, a member of the Church who 
has filled a mission and who knows the doctrines of the Church, and 
who at one time was active in Church work. He had a cigar in his 
mouth, and I asked, "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?" He answered, 
"You 'don't know how good a cigar is after meals." And I answered, 
"You and the Lord for it. He says it is not good, and the fact that 
it is a filt'hy habit and what the Lord has said, would keep me from it, 
even though it did taste good." He answered, "This doesn't hurt any- 
body. It is jail nonsense to think tobacco hurts a person. I am just 
as strong physically today as I have ever been." I asked, "Are you, 
mentally?" He answered, "It has not hurt my mental condition a bit. 
I can carry on my business as well as ever I could." "How has it 
affected you spiritually?" "Well," he answered, "I don't think it has 
hurt me spiritually. I still have a testimony of the gospel." I asked him 
if he' attended his meetings. "No," he answered. "Are you active in 
your Priesthood quorum?" He said he was not. "Do you pay your 
tithing?" "Well, I am not a full tithepayer ; I pay a little once in a 
while." I said, "Now, honestly, do you ever do anything in the Church 
at all?" "No," he answered, "I must admit that l'do not." "And why 
don't you?" After a moment's pause he answered "I don't know." I 
then quoted for him a part of the passage quoted above, and as he 
looked at me he said, "Well, I don't know. I have never looked at it 
in that way before." 

My mission calls me, as one of the presidency of the Aaronic 
priesthood, to study the conditions of the young men in the Church. I 
have seen them grow into manhood, become active in Church work ; and 
I have seen some drift away and become inactive. In every case in- 
vestigated — and I have studied many — the cause of their indifference 
has been traced to the use of tobacco; and I am satisfied that. the use 
of tobacco or liquor will drive the Spirit of the Lord from a person 
and leave that' person to grope in darkness. To partake of and enjoy 
the Spirit of the Lord and the blessings promised, we must keep the 
commandments and remember that every man's work shall be made 
manifest, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire. 

I don't know that the Lord meant that he would destroy the body in 
the literal sense of destruction, although there is no sound argument 
that can be used to show that liquor and tobacco do not have an inju- 
rious effect upon the body. They are injurious not only to the physical 
body, but to the spiritual body as well. I have yet to find one person 
who has had the Priesthood of God conferred upon him who indulges 
in the use of tobacco and who insists upon continuing in this habit who 
has retained the Spirit of God and continued active in the Church. This 
is evidence to me that it destroys a man's usefulness and spirituality. 

I suggest' that we give some little thought to this, that we may see 
for ourselves, not for the purpose of ridiculing our brethren who are 
so weak that they give themselves over to these filthy habits, "but to 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



47 



encourage them and to strengthen ourselves, in order that we might 
see the dangers lurking in our midst and keep ourselves free from these 
dangers. Let us cultivate the Spirit of the Lord ; let us cultivate that 
spirit of cooperation and love which the world has discovered exists 
in our midst, and let us go to those who are engaging in these per- 
nicious practices and encourage them to clean themselves up, in order 
that they too may be fed spiritually and may partajce of the blessings 
of God which he has promised. Do we truly believe that we are the 
children of God, created in his image, and that we are bought with a 
price, the price of the blood of our Redeemer shed for us? If so, let us 
glorify God in our bodies and in our spirits, which are God's. We 
should always be in possession of the Spirit of God and should give 
heed to its whisperings, for without that Spirit, we are told, we cannot 
know the things of God. His Only Begotten Son suffered and was 
crucified that we, as his children, might enter again into his presence 
and partake of his joys. He has provided different degrees of glory 
and has given us to understand that we are to inherit the degree we 
earn, through our faithfulness upon this earth, which we are told is 
a preparatory state. Being a kind and loving Father, he has given every 
opportunity for us to know of the things that we should know to prepare 
us for the glory in which he dwells. 

One of the ancient apostles has said: 

"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in 
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal 
bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 

"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 

"Fop if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit 
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. 

"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." 

May we conduct our lives that we shall never grieve that Spirit 
or cause it to depart from us, but may we possess it always to guide us 
and help us in our efforts to serve God, is my prayer which I ask in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER M. HOWARD RANDALL 

President of the Morgan Stake 

My brethren and sisters: I must confess that this is a surprise to 
me to be asked to say anything at this conference. I have en- 
joyed the exercises and the remarks made thus far this morning. 
My heart is in the work. I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
is true. I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints was organized and instituted through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and that he was an instrument in the hands of God in doing 
this work. I am proud to be numbered as a Latter-day Saint, and 
to be with you to bear testimony to the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I have had a good many thoughts while sitting here this morn- 
ing, and I feel that if every one of us responded to the calls made 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



upon us, carried the responsibilities placed upon us as members 
of this Church, that this work would be more successful. I fear 
that sometimes there are men and women upon whom we place 
responsibilities who, to a certain extent, shun those responsibilities, 
and feel that they are not so important as thought by those who placed 
the responsibilities upon them. I often wonder why it is that men and 
women who have accepted the gospel, and have a testimony burning 
in their souls that Jesus is the Christ, shun these responsibilities. 
I often wonder why it is that they do not sense the responsibilities 
placed upon their shoulders. 

Not long ago I listened to the testimony of a young man who 
had been on a mission. What Brother Smith said brought it to 
my mind. He and another elder had filled missions and were given 
honorable releases. Just previous to their departure, a family 
of Saints gave a little banquet in their honor. Just as they closed 
the banquet, they passed tea around, and asked them if they would 
have a drink of tea. The elder that was with this young man said, 
"I have received my release ; it is all right for me to drink tea."' 
He drank five cups ! After it was over, the lady took the other) 
elder aside and made this remark, "I have always understood that 
ten cups of tea would kill a man. He drank five cups. I wish I had 
given him the .other five." The elder taken- aside said, "I wished 
I could have given him the other five cups myself. To think I 
have labored two and a half years preaching the gospel and then 
the elder I had labored with and associated with do the thing Ij 
had been teaching people not to do — the very thing he had been 
teaching them not to do!" The result was that he left, disgraced; 
people were disgusted with him. 

At this same gathering I heard of a missionary who had 
labored two and a half years in England and had been successful in 
converting a young lady and her mother to the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 'They came to the valleys of the mountains, expecting to 
see the Saints living the gospel, but she told me, "To my surprise, 
as I walked down the sidewalk in Salt Lake City, I met the very 
man who had taught me the gospel in England walking down the 
street with a cigarette in his mouth." And she wrote to this 
elder, "I am disgusted with 'Mormonism,' with the elders who 
taught me the gospel in England, to think that, after I have come 
to Zion, they live as they do live. I looked to see men of God,: 
living the things they had taught me ; but on the contrary, I see 
some of these young men are not living as they ought to live.'" 
They bring disgrace upon the cause of God, and upon the great: 
majority who live their religion. I would not have you think, my 
brethren and sisters, for one minute, that I would justify the 
woman in leaving the Church, because of this. But I do believe 
that men and women who accept membership and positions in the 
Church should live so that when they come in contact with other 
people, it may be seen that they are living their religion. 

I often wonder if I am going through life failing to sound the 



ELDER M. HOWARD RANDALL 



49 



warning voice that I should sound. When I meet my Maker on 
the other side, if the question is asked, "Did you do your full duty 
as a servant of God and as a Latter-day Saint in teaching the men and 
women that Jesus is the Christ and Joseph Smith a prophet of God, and 
in performing every obligation that God asked you to perform, or did 
you evade the responsibilities he placed upon you?" I often wonder 
what my answer will be. 

One time, when I was stake superintendent of Sunday Schools, 
a woman came to me and said, "My son has more confidence in 
you than in any other man that I know of in the stake." I won-, 
dered then, as I have wondered since, if my life was of such a 
nature as to affect this young man growing in this Church, growing 
in knowledge and information, or taking the downward road that 
leads to destruction ; and whether, if my life affected him in a 
way that caused him not to live as he should, I would be held 
responsible in any degree for his action. The thought came back 
to me that if my life affected men and women so that they did 
not live right, I would be held responsible in the end for some of 
those conditions. I believe it is my duty, my responsibility, to live 
the life of a Latter-day Saint as the Lord intended I should, that T 
shall listen to the whisperings of the Spirit of God and obey them, 
that I may not be found in by and forbidden paths, or in company 
that the Lord does not desire a servant of his to be in. I should 
be exemplary and carry with me the dignity of my position, the 
sense of responsibility that God has placed upon me and live and 
magnify the same before him. I hope and pray that when I meet 
on the other side with my children or associates that none can say 
that I did not do as I should, that I did not teach them by the proper 
example. 

I remember a number of years ago visiting a family in our 
stake. Previous to visiting them, the lady of the house came and 
asked if we would not please talk to her son about his drinking 
beer. I remember going into the home. The elder with me talked 
to the young man and said it was not right to get drunk, as he 
was doing, that it was breaking his mother's heart. The young 
man turned around to the elder and said, "I want you to under- 
stand that my mother is responsible for the life I have lived. When 
I was a boy twelve or fifteen years of age. my mother set me 
down to the table with crackers and beer. It created a desire 
for beer, and I cannot leave it alone." Could you have seen that 
mother, as she sat by the old stove, the fire burning bright and 
showing the tears running down her cheeks, it would have grieved 
your heart. 

I do not know whether the son told the truth. There may have 
been some truth in it. I felt that a young man should have had 
respect enough for his mother not to have made the statement 
in her presence, at least. On the other hand, I have wondered 
many times since, "Were the words of that young man true? Did 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his mother's, life affect his life in such a manner that he did not care 
for her teachings? 

I want to tell you, brethren and sisters, that these are serious 
reflections. The souls of the children of God are precious in his 
sight. It should be the aim and desire of every father and mother 
to teach fthe gospel in a way that will impress men and women. 
I believe with all my soul that it is true. The young men and wom- 
en of the Church today are growing, and to a great extent, their 
destiny is in our hands and power to place them in an armor that 
will lead |them upward in the cause of truth, that they may bei 
virtuous and live as God intended, or downward against his will. 

We spend thousands of dollars to convert men and women 
who live in foreign lands and in America, who are not worth any 
more, or as much, perhaps, as the men and women who are in our 
midst, who are our neighbors day by day and who are starving for 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. Perhaps some of you may say, "They 
have plenty of opportunity to go to the organizations,, where the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is taught.'' It is true, but the responsibility 
that God has placed upon us carries with it enough importance to 
teach wherever we are, that we should bear the testimony that 
Jesus is the Christ, and in such a manner that it will convince men 
that it is of God. 

A little piece of poetry I sometimes read as I visit the Sunday 
Schools of our stake, called "The Sunday School Automobile," ap- 
plies to every organization in the Church : 

All rules cf success considered, the most essential element is "Getting 
started." Therefore, use a self-starter on your Sunday School automobile. 
Use the brakes of patience and self-control. 
Put large quantities of hope in the grease cups. 

Use a perseverance brand of gascline as motive power, instead of hot air. 
Have the timer properly set, EARLY. 

Have the carburetor properly adjusted, admitting a mixture of equal parts 
of earnestness and will power. 

Use the primer of enthusiasm. 

Best results can be obtained by using the four cylinders of knowledge — 

The knowledge of self, 

The knowledge of company, 

The knowledge of work, 

The knowledge of children (men). 
Advance the sparker of ambition for more speed. 

Open wide the throttle of faith in yourself, in your work, and in your 
calling, to secure more power. 
Use the polish of courtesy. 

Use tires of stick-to-it-iveness, on non-discouragement rims. 
Use the Golden Rule steering wheel 

Put on search lights of character, and with the foregoing equipment, the 
Sunday School automobile will take every hill of disappointment and discourage, 
ment on high gear. 

I believe, brethren and sisters, if these things were put into the 
life of every man and woman who accepts responsibility in this 
Church, if we would sense that responsibility, if we would first 



ELDER M. HOWARD RANDALL 



51 



take an inventory of our own lives and gather out the weak points 
and improve upon them, that we would be successful as individuals. 
It is said the chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and it is so 
with men and women who accept positions in this Church. I have 
delighted in working in the organizations of the Church. I consider 
it an honor to be permitted to work in the organizations for the 
growth, development, and benefit of the human family. My desire 
is that we may all sense this responsibility. 

My testimony is that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of the living God, that he gave his life as a testimony that 
his doctrine and teachings are of God. I recall his words when 
he left Nauvoo to go to Carthage jail. When he looked upon 
Nauvoo he said, "I have a conscience void of offense toward God 
and toward all men. I shall die innocent. It shall yet be said 
of me, 'He was murdered in cold blood'." 

My grandfather heard a message delivered to the governor, 
saying, "They intend to kill the prophet," and he said, "If yo t u 
know anything about it, keep still." My grandfather said it al- 
ways seemed peculiar to him that a man who held a responsible 
position, and who was, no doubt, in a position to prevent certain 
conditions, should say, "If you know anything about it, keep still." 
My testimony to you is that the present leaders of this Church are 
men inspired of God and doing their utmost for the advancement of 
those who are members of this Church. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us with his Spirit, protect 
us from harm, and extend to us and create within our minds a : 
greater desire to love and honor the authorities and to honor our* 
call, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

A duet, "Come unto me," was sung by Earl Martin and Ronald 

Salt. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

The next speaker will be President Soren M. Nielsen of the 
North Sanpete stake. Brother Nielsen was formerly stake super- 
intendent of Mutuals, and a military leader. He is now proving 
himself to be a real captain as a president of the North Sanpete 
stake. 

ELDER SOREN M. NIELSEN 

President of the North Sanpete Stake 

I appreciate the kind words of our presiding authority here this 
morning. I have learned to love President Hart through my acquaint- 
ance and my associations with him. He was present at the time I was 
set apart as president of the North Sanpete stake of Zion and had 
something to do, I am sure, with my being chosen. 

Last evening after arriving in the city, I was dining with a 
person from home who said he intended to leave the city some time 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



today for home. I urged upon him to attend some of the sessions of 
the conference hefore he returned. When he informed me that time 
would hardly permit, I rather insisted that he attend at least the 
Opening session of the conference, this morning in the Tabernacle, 
as that, I thought, was the most important session of the conference, 
the most interesting, and he would feel well paid for spending that 
much time in the city. This morning, when the president of the 
Church read my name as one to speak here, it came as a thunder- 
holt from the sky, and I have been wondering since if that is my 
penalty for singling out one of the sessions of the conference as be- 
ing better than another. I am sure, my brethren and sisters, whether 
it is the opening session or the closing session, it matters little to Lat- 
ter-day Saints who are present to participate in the Spirit of the Lord 
and to be fed the bread of life. I am sure the message delivered in 
one session is as important as that in another, provided our hearts 
are in tune with the mission and purpose of this Church. I am con- 
vinced of that this morning, for I have thoroughly enjoyed myself 
here, and I pray that while I occupy this position, the same Spirit 
may actuate my thoughts that has prompted those who have spoken 
before me, and that has influenced the rendition of the songs and the 
music listened to this morning. 

I was impressed with the testimony of Bishop Smith in his con- 
versation with the non-member of our Church in California. We see 
on every hand where men are trying to capitalize the organization of 
this Church for the purpose of making money. I remember reading 
in the public press of a certain organization that- had offered to con- 
tribute to this Church a site for a temple in one of the California 
cities. Their sole motive, my brethren and sisters, was to bring Lat- 
ter-day Saints there in a body, sell them real estate, perhaps, or in 
some other way enrich their pocketbooks. 

I want to contrast that with the motive of a man with whom I 
held a conversation just recently, a man whom I have known all my 
life. We have grown up, virtually, together, at least since boyhood — 
he a member of the Presbyterian Church, and I affiliated with the 
Latter-day Saints. He said to me, "Brother Nielsen, I have come 
to the conclusion that if there is a true Church of Christ on the face 
of the earth today, it is not the Presbyterian church, but that it is the 
'Mormon' Church. I have learned to appreciate you people. I have 
marveled at the accomplishments of the membership of your Church. 
I have learned to love and admire you and others with whom I have 
mingled all my life. I have learned that there is nothing uplifting 
or that will tend to uplift the souls of men that the Latter-day Saints 
are not seeking. There is nothing that will tend to destroy the char- 
acter of individuals but that the Latter-day Saints are always ready to 
condemn it. They are constantly striving for the development of the 
talents of their children ; they are anxious to see them grow, and they 
make liberal provisions for their education and their advancement in 



ELDER SOREN M. NIELSEN 



53 



life. The social and community life of no other people can be com- 
pared with theirs. When I compare a community of Latter-day Saints 
with one made up of other organizations, I note that when men and 
women belong to lodges and secret organizations there is a tendency 
to pull apart, to segregate themselves into classes, each one destroy- 
ing, or at least tending to destroy, the efforts of the other. I see no 
good in lodges or fraternal organizations. I see definite good in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They are banded to- 
gether working for a common cause — and that always characterized by 
the highest ideals." 

I said to him, "I have noted you in recent years especially, that 
you have been more friendly to us, and I have predicted to others 
that you some day would become a member of this Church ; I trust 
that I shall not be disappointed." 

And he said to me: "I am ready now, if I only dared, if I only 
had the courage, to enter the waters of baptism, but I know what will 
happen to me; I shall be ostracized by my family and friends, those 
who have been near to me all the days of my life, and I have not 
the moral courage to break away from those associations to become 
one of your people. I know the criticism that would be heaped upon 
me. . And yet I am a Latter-day Saint. I am willing to confess that 
I have accepted of the gospel, that I believe it ; and even now, if I had 
the least assurance that through my membership in the Church I could 
enjoy a small portion of the growth and development that I have noted 
in others, in your Church, even though I am pretty well along in life, 
if I could be able through affiliation with your Church to learn to 
stand before an audience, to express myself in public (he is a tal- 
ented man, by the way, but (timid), if I could acquire that knowledge 
and ability, even now I believe I would become a member of your 
Church, in spite of the criticism that I know would come to me." 

I promised him that if he would come into the Church, accept the 
Priesthood, lend himself to its influences and teachings, he would live 
to see the day that he would be an active member of this Church and 
that his voice would yet be heard publicly in the defense of its truth. 

Brethren and sisters, I want to express to you my appreciation 
for my membership in this Church, for the fact that I see, as this 
brother has discovered, that there is no place in the world I would 
rather be than here. I thank my Father in heaven for the fact that 
the missionaries of this Church have invaded foreign lands and 
preached the gospel to my family and made it possible for me to come 
here and enjoy the associations and the blessings of membership in 
this Church. I have heard many of, the testimonies borne in this 
building ; I have been here at Mutual Improvement conferences, where 
our testimony meeting is usually held, and I have heard some inspir- 
ing testimonies borne. Usually they begin by saying, "I have been 
taught the principles of the gospel by my parents. I am thankful that 
I was born in a Latter-day Saint home, etc. I am thankful that I have 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



been able to go on a mission and receive tbere a testimony of the gos- 
pel." 

I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that being born in 
the Church is not necessary. I was not born of "Mormon" parentage, 
though my mother is a member of the Church. I was not raised in a 
Latter-day Saint home, strictly speaking. I have never been on a 
mission. But through my affiliation with the auxiliary organizations 
and the Priesthood quorums of this Church, I have acquired a testi- 
mony of the divinity of this gospel. I have learned to know that this 
is the Church of Christ, that it was reestablished under the inspiration 
of our Father in heaven and through the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and that those who adhere to its teachings, make the ideals 
of the Church their ideals, will enjoy greater blessings than any other 
people on the face of the earth ; also, that we can become a happier 
people, and more fully comprehend the purposes of life than any one 
else, through the study of the gospel. I pray, brethren and sisters, that 
all of us may sense our responsibility as Latter-day Saints. 

In conclusion, may I say that I am confident that the influence 
brought to bear upon the individual to whom I referred has come 
from the example set by members of his community, not by their ser- 
mons. I believe that the family life of the people of that ward, the 
community life, the social activities, in other words, the conduct of 
those people as Latter-day Saints, have converted him to the principles 
of "Mormonism," and not the sermons they have preached on the Sab- 
bath day. May we so order our lives, brethren and sisters, that those 
who are watching us, and observing our actions, may come into the 
fold of this Church through the example we set, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

Assistant Church Historian 

In just three years and a half from now the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints will be one hundred years old. It has been, and is, 
a most remarkable organization. There never has been another one 
like it upon the face of the earth. We do not have to compare the 
Church to which we belong with any of the so-called Christian churches 
of today, so far as members and progress are concerned, but we can 
-consistently compare it with other dispensations that the Lord has 
established upon the earth for the salvation of mankind ; -and particularly 
do we take pleasure in comparing it with the Church which was organ- 
ized more than eighteen hundred years ago by the Savior himself and 
his apostles. We can also draw comparison between the Church to 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



55 



which we belong and the Church organized among the Nephites about 
the same time that the Church was organized in what we call the old 
world. But the history of the Nephite Church is very brief. And the 
same might be said of the history of the original Church organized in 
Palestine, or in Asia. 

There are some comparisons that I sometimes think of. Jesus 
was thirty years old when he commenced to preach. Up to that time 
we have but very little knowledge of what he did. Joseph Smith was 
twenty-five years old when he, as an instrument in the hands of the 
Lord, organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1830. 
After one hundred years had passed away from the time that Christ 
commenced his ministry we find (by referring to the historians of that 
day, such as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the Acts of the Apostles 
and the writings of the historian Eusebius, who wrote the history of the 
first 325 years of the so-called Christian church), that there was 
scarcely anything left of the original church. It is a strange thing that 
such should be the case, but it was undoubtedly in the providence of 
the Lord. Before the first century of that dispensation had passed 
away all the apostles had been killed except John ; other leaders of the 
church had also gone to their rest, most of them falling as martyrs to 
truth, for that was a time of martyrdom. John, who did not taste 
death, as we understand it, was the only apostle left. So, at the end of 
one hundred years from the time that Christ commenced his ministry 
in (Galilee the great majority of the people who belonged to the 
original church had passed away, either by natural death or had 
fallen as martyrs, or gone into apostasy. The falling away had become 
so universal during the latter part of the first century of the Christian 
era that there was scarcely anyone, to speak of left professing the true 
gospel of Jesus Christ when the century ended. False doctrines had 
been introduced into the church, and the falling ,away, which had been 
predicted by Paul and others, had indeed taken place. 

It is different with the dispensation to which we belong. When 
this Church shall be one hundred years old, the historians will be 
able to record that it never before was any stronger or its member- 
ship more numerous. We can easily judge the condition of the 
Church three years and a half hence. At the present time we can 
say that the Church never had so many organized stakes of Zion 
as it has now, and never before so many bishop's wards, nor so 
many missionary fields at one time ; that is, if we make exception 
of a few temporary missions established in the early days of the 
Church; but, taking it all throughout, the Church to which we be- 
long never had a more prosperous existence than it has at the 
present time, when we refer to the thousands of noble men and' 
women in it. We may regret that there are some weak members, 
who are not as true to the gospel of Jesus Christ as they might be, 
but there is a sufficient number of faithful men and women, both 
young and old, to warrant my statement ; the majority of the mem- 
bers of this Church would be an honor to any community. That 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



really should prove to all that we have borne good fruit, and our 
actions are now being copied by many of the people of the world 
who have figured with organizations that have been less successful 
than ours has been. \ . . • 

It is one thing to make history, another thing to write it. If 
it had not been for the writers I have mentioned, who belonged to 
the original Church, what would the doings of Christ mean to 
us? We would have known next to nothing of his activities. The 
doctrines he taught would have been hid in mystery and conjec- 
tures. For instance, if Matthew, or some other historian, had not 
recorded the Sermon on the Mount, we would not have had that 
splendid exposition of gospel truths. And if somebody had not 
recorded the many other beautiful sayings _ of Christ and his 
apostles, what would we have known of the ministry of Christ and 
of his apostles? We would merely have, had some vague ideas 
handed down by tradition that would lead astray more than lead 
aright ; but because these things that are written, we have at least 
some knowledge of these earlier dispensations. 

In our day, the first thing the Lord did after the Church to 
which we belong was organized with six members, in the little 
village of Fayette, Seneca county, New York, was to command that 
a Church recorder should be appointed, a man who should write 
down what was taking place. That man was Oliver Cowdery. He 
had previously assisted Joseph Smith the Prophet in translating 
the Book of Mormon ; and now, after that sacred record had been 
completed and printed, his labor with the pen was continued 
through his appointment as the first Church recorder. Since that 
time we have had recorders and historians in the Church who have 
been more or less faithful, and more or less efficient in doing their 
work. Soon Oliver Cowdery was appointed to other positions in 
the Church, and another man was called to be Church recorder. 
But as that man was not very faithful in the discharge of his duties 
the early history of the Church is not as complete as we would' like 
it to be. There are certain very important dates lacking because 
John Whitmer did not do his duty. Nevertheless, we have suf- 
ficient to show that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is a most complete and successful organization, and we also re- 
joice in the promise made that it shall never come to an end. Other 
dispensations have ceased to exist, but this one to which we belong 
will continue, and the Church shall finally grow into the Kingdom 
of Heaven, over which Christ shall reign as King of kings, and Lord 
of lords. 

It requires much effort and labor to keep track of the thou- 
sands and tens of thousands of missionaries who have gone out 
from the headquarters of the Church to preach the gospel. We 
are, at the present time, engaged in making a list of them. In a 
few weeks we expect to complete the same, and we will then be 
able to state approximately how many elders, and how many mis- 
sionary sisters, have been sent out from the headquarters of the 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



57 



Church to preach the gospel in different lands and climes. We 
will also have a good idea of how many people have been baptized 
since the Church was organized, notwithstanding the fact that 
many important Church records have been destroyed or lost. We 
will also know approximately how many branches of the Church 
have been organized in the different countries of the world, where 
our missionaries have labored. You will, perhaps, be surprised 
to learn that they are numbered by thousands, and you will be 
astonished to Know that at one time there were nearly a thousand 
branches of the Church in Great Britain alone. We will surely 
have something interesting to tell the Latter-day Saints when the 
Church is one hundred years old. 

It has already taken much time and money, and also neces- 
sitated much travel, to gather material and record the events of 
the history of the Church from the beginning to the close of the 
nineteenth century. Years ago we found, at the Historian's office, 
that we could not locate ourselves within the walls of that little 
building which stood across the street from where the large Church 
building now stands, and there write histories of the stakes of 
Zion and of the different missions of the Church. We found it was 
necessary to go abroad, travel extensively and gather material for 
history in many lands and climes. Your humble servant has had the 
pleasure, if I may call it such, to be a globe trotter. Some people 
have thought that I have traveled more than necessary, but I know 
better than that, and am convinced that I have not traveled nearly 
as much as I should have done in order to become a good and' 
reliable historian. Yet I have traveled about 490,000 miles in the 
interest of the Church, and I have come to the conclusion that the 
work accomplished could not have been done in any other way than 
by going into the f'eld for material. We have had Church recorders 
and historians all the time since the organization of the Church, 
and they have found it possible to record facts as they have been 
reported to headquarters from time to time ; but the recorders could 
never . make a complete . history of this Church unless they go abroad, 
visit with the elders and saints in different parts of the world, 
peruse records and become acquainted geographically with the 
stakes of Zion and the countries of the world. Then, in connection 
with the reports that are sent in from year to year, they can write 
history, and it may be said that these reports are now better than 
they have been before. A complete history of this Church, in my 
opinion, can never be written unless that mode of procedure is 
followed. 

We do not know what will take place in the near future ; only 
this we believe, that great events are close at hand. But we do 
sincerely hope and pray for a general awakening in the interest of 
Church history. Sometimes, when I visit some of the stakes of 
Zion in the interest of history I am looked upon as a sort of Rip 
van Winkle, or some ancient of days, who has been asleep for 
twenty years, or more, and it seems as if some people are actually 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



annoyed by it. I do not say this as a slnr upon the Saints generally. 
This lethargy can perhaps be traced to the fact that for years only 
very little attention has been paid to Church history in a public 
way. We preach about the Word of Wisdom. Imagine what the 
consequence would be, if our brethren from time to time did not 
open their mouths to draw attention to that particular word of God. 
Even, after mentioning it and speaking about it repeatedly, such 
conditions exist as those we have had explained to us in this meet- 
ing by the brethren who have preceded me. Now, inasmuch as 
the importance of history has not been mentioned much of late 
years, the people have become careless about it, and quite fre- 
quently we hear somebody say, "We have enough to do with the 
present and looking out for the future; let the past alone." It may 
be true that the present is more important to us than the past ; and 
yet I contend that without knowing something about the past, we 
do not know where we come in as elders of the Church laboring in 
the vineyard both at home and abroad. It is necessary for us to 
know how w r e fit in as we continue the labors, commenced by) 
Joseph Smith the Prophet and continued by Brigham Young and 
his successors. In Great Britain we need to know how the present 
missionaries fit in with the labors in earlier days by Heber C. 
Kimball, Orson Hyde, Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, Wilford 
Woodruff, and many others. We from Scandinavia need to know 
how our present missionaries fit in with the labors commenced by 
Erastus Snow and his fellow-laborers seventy-six years ago. With- 
out some knowledge in regard to the past, we scarcely know where 
we are at. We know we belong to a great organization, but not 
always what our particular duties are in building upon the founda- 
tion that the heroes and heroines of this Church laid many years 
ago. 

My message as one of the historians of this Church is this : We 
want cooperation ; we need a general awakening in regard to the 
importance of record-keeping. We must become better posted in 
regard to the history of this Church, the most important organiza- 
tion of its kind that ever existed upon the face of the earth. We 
cannot sit still and quietly at the Historian's office and steer the 
great ship of Zion historically, we need the cooperation of the local 
authorities and the people generally. We want the stake clerks 
and ward clerks, and clerks of the priesthood and auxiliary organ- 
izations to stand by us. And when we send out, or go out, for in- 
formation we want to examine and peruse the records that are in 
existence for historical material. We raise our voice against the 
destruction or the losing of records, and draw attention to the folly 
of looking upon record-books in the same light that a school boy 
looks upon his copy book — when it is written full it is of no further 
use. The records of a ward or quorum are entirely different from 
that. A blank book is worth nothing to the historian, but being 
filled with records it is, in many instances, worth its weight in gold. 
We would, therefore, earnestly insist that the brethren and sisters 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



59 



in charge of records, or even private journals, do not destroy them 
or lose them. The time will surely come when they will be wanted. 
Probably much that is in them may be mere chaff, that never will be 
worth copying - , but there will always be something found in these 
records that will be of use to k the historian. I cannot remember that 
I ever in my life have perul&d a record book of any kind — and 
I have perused thousands of them — but what I have found some- 
thing in it of historical importance. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us wake up to a realization of the 
fact, that there is something of vital importance for us to know in 
the past, as well as in the present and the future. I speak as one 
who has devoted almost his entire life in the historical field, and 
who for many years has endeavored to draw attention to the fact 
that the writing of history is the next thing to making it. M'ay 
God bless us and enable us to be faithful and diligent in discharg- 
ing the duties pertaining to our respective callings in the service of 
God, I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I think you will agree with me, my brethren and sisters, that we 
have had a musical and spiritual feast here today, and now I am 
anxious that during the few remaining minutes I may be able to continue 
the feast that has thus far been served to us. 

Among the minor prophecies given to Joseph Smith was the 
prediction of the angel Moroni, that Joseph's name should be known 
for good and for evil among every nation, tongue, and people; that is, 
that good and evil should be spoken of him among all people. "For 
many years the great preponderance of the things uttered and written in 
fulfilment of this prophecy was against him, but now the tide is turn- 
ing. Mr. Cody, better known as ''Buffalo Bill," in writing the preface 
to his book entitled, The Great Salt Lake Trail, called attention to the 
fact that the libraries were full of books written about the "Mormon" 
people, "generally," he said, "against the people, and usually with an 
inexcusable ability at exaggeration." There is this to be noted, that 
wherever there has been one to raise up his voice against the prophet 
or his people, there has been one equally strong in his defense. The 
prophet gave the instance of Mr. Reid, the lawyer who defended him 
in one of the fifty-five trumped-up cases that were brought against 
Joseph. Mr. Reid said that the thought came to him that he must 
go and defend the' Lord's anointed. Said he, "I did not know what it 
meant, but thought I must go and clear the Lord's anointed." 

There is this peculiarity, that even those who have attempted to be 
spiteful toward the prophet and his followers have often unwittingly 
contributed to their good. That was true in one of the early books 
written against the prophet by Pomeroy Tucker of Palmyra, in his 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



book entitled, The Origin of Mormonism. He gives us the picture 
of Martin Harris, one of the most prosperous farmers in the neigh- 
borhood, being willing to sacrifice his fertile, eighty-acre farm on the 
north side of Palmyra, and his wife and family, for the testimony of 
the gospel. He also tells us of writing to Sidney Rigdon for help and 
encouragement in the production of this anti-"Mormon" book, at a 
time when it would have appealed most strongly to Sidney Rigdon, for 
at that time he had returned to Pennsylvania a disappointed man in his 
vain ambition to lead this Church. But he got no aid or comfort from 
Sidney Rigdon. 

In a later book, by Gregg, bearing the euphonious title, The 
Prophet of Palmyra, an affidavit is presented from the ex-Governor 
of Utah, Mr. Harding, in which he gives his testimony of Joseph and 
Oliver, walking through the woods every morning a considerable dis- 
tance with a small "take," as the printer calls it, of manuscript of the 
Book of Mormon for the publication of that volume by Mr. Grandin of 
Palmyra ; and so sacredly did they esteem that manuscript that they 
would not permit it to be in the care of the printer or in his office over 
night, but walked a long distance through the woods to have returned to 
them the portion of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon which they 
had delivered in the morning. 

It is interesting to note the views of those who attempted to be 
friendly and who express opinions as to the perpetuity of "Mormon- 
ism." Here is Mr. Gregg, seriously declaring at the conclusion of his 
book in which he purported to write in all fairness, his conclusion that 
before the end of the twentieth century the story of the Golden Bible 
would be but a memory — quite a different conclusion from that penned 
by the writer of a book entitled, A Tramp With a Poet Through the 
Rockies, to the effect that "Mormonism" "has a great future in America 
— it is not a dying cult." 

Quite recently we have had some very warm commendation by 
different writers. Many of you have read in the Saturday Evening 
Post that friendly article in which it was said:^ 

"It is a common practice to speak with admiration of the business 
organization of large corporations, and there is little doubt that the executives 
whose powerful intellects are. responsible for the economic and efficient 
operation cf the countless departments and divisions of a great steel company 
or great oil company are entitled to a large amount of respect and esteem. 
There is little doubt that there is no other organization in the world that obtains 
from its employees the loyalty and labor and the results that the 'Mormon' 
Church so bountifully receives from its five hundred thousand unpaid mem- 
bers. This statement may possibly be laughed off. but only after a spell 
of laughing so protracted and so forced as seriously to damage the most 
powerful laughing apparatus in existence." 

So, if there is any one who wishes to laugh off that thoughtful state- 
ment in the way suggested, they are welcome to do so. 

In the September number of the Pacific Netvs, Mr. C. I. B. Moore, 
the Vice-President of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company of 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



61 



California, who • traveled through Southern Utah, wrote this concern- 
ing our people : 

"I want to say right here that my visit to Utah gave me a very favorable 
impression of the 'Mormon' people. We saw many evidences of th.ir thrift 
and intelligence and found those we conversed with most agreeable 'and 
hospitable people, and in many instances educated and well informed. As 
good citizens, I doubt whether Uncle Sam possesses any more favorable type." 

A Utah man who travels the United States over in a civk position 
told me yesterday of some kindly words given to him recently at 
Atlantic City by the multi-millionaire, C. Z. Mitchell, of New York, 
sometimes called the dean of electricians, or the dean of the electrical 
field. He met this man from Utah at the close of a meeting of the 
electrical convention and expressed very friendly regard for any one 
from Utah, and then explained to representatives from other states who 
stood near, "I have a fine feeling toward your state ;" and to another, 
"There is much that can be said in favor of your state ;" and to a third ; 
"I could say a good deal in praise of the state you are from, but I want 
to say that Utah, in my opinion, -stands without a peer. I am thinking 
of her people, and I say that for sobriety, sincerity, industry and honesty 
of purpose, and the cardinal virtues generally, I feel that the Utah 
people have no equal." - And then he went on to refer to his experience 
in meeting President Joseph F. Smith and his counselors and said that 
whatever they said to him they said in great sincerity, and that he was 
much affected by jthe simplicity and the democratic attitude of the great 
president in assisting him on with his overcoat at the close of the 
interview. 

Recently I was told of this incident that occurred in ,the Michigan 
University about thirty years ago when there were a number of Utah 
boys there. Some of the evangelical preachers of Ann Arbor sought 
to have these boys expelled from school on the ground that they were 
simply missionaries of the Church and not there for the purposes of 
scholarship. The dean called one of the Utah students before him and 
asked him if the accusations were true, and he was assured that they 
were not true, but that the Utah boys were there as legitimate students 
for purposes of study only. And then my friend said to me : "I was 
surprised to hear Dean Hutchinson, dean of the Law Department of 
Michigan University, say that both morally and intellectually the students 
from Utah stood higher than the students from any other state in the 
Union, and that he would strongly oppose any effort to expel them 
from the institution." . 

Mr. Frankau, a writer for the Sunday Pictorial, London, gave us 
some interesting words as the result of his visit here. I think our 
young sisters may be interested in the compliment he pays them. He 
is answering, of course, the old theory that existed in his country that 
the missionaries were in England for the purpose of winning young 
women to bring them to Utah for questionable purposes. The writer 
disposes of the question in this language : 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And if anybody after reading this article, still imagines that 'Mormon' 
missionaries come to Great Britain for the purpose of decoying British 
spinsters of certain or uncertain ages into secret harems, I can only advise 
him to take a little walk down State street or South Temple avenue of 
Salt Lake City, when the high moon is riding molten above the elms and 
poplars which Brigham Young planted, and observe the many Utah maidens 
whose bright eyes regard the stranger sidewise from under isilken lashes 
as he passes by; for they are very, very alluring, these Utah maidens, 
st> alluring indeed that 'Mormon' polygamy, if it ever comes to be restarted 
will most certainly begin, like 'Mormon' charity, at home." 

In the future there will be scarcely any excuse for people to be so 
uninformed as to slander this people, because they can go to such a 
book as that recently issued by Macmillan & Company, entitled, The 
Fruits of \Mormonism, and can see from United States census figures 
how this people stand on all the vital questions — of the high birth-rate 
and the low death-rate, the high marriage-rate and the low divorce- 
rate, the low insanity percentage, the high charitable-rate, the high 
educational standing, and from all those things that are known as vital 
statistics, determine from impartial government statistics the true stand- 
ing of this people. 

Time will not permit to continue along this line, but it is for us 
to be prepared to receive praise as well as censure, and we may ap- 
propriate praise without immodesty, knowing that it is said concerning 
the people collectively and not individually — a very telling distinction, 
which the Lord made through the Prophet Joseph Smith in speaking of 
this Church, as recorded in the first section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants. May we always merit the good spoken of us. Amen. 

The choir sang, "And the glory of the Lord," by Handel. 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder Quayle Cannon, of the 
Bountiful First ward. 



SECOND OVERFLOW' MEETING 

The second overflow meeting of the conference was held in the 
Assembly Hall at 2 o'clock p. m., Sunday, October 3, 1926. 

Elder Levi Edgar Young, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The singing was furnished by the LeGrande ward choir of Salt 
Lake City; Elder Charles C. Martin, conducting; Elder Frank W. 
Asper, organist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel," after 
which the choir sang the anthem, "Song of the Redeemed." 

Prayer was offered by Elder David R. Lyon, of the Ensign ward, 
Salt Lake City. 

The choir sang the anthem, "By Babylon's Wave." 



ELDER WILLIAM I ONES

ELDER WILLIAM JONES 

President of the Moapa Stake 

If I can but control my fluttering heart, I shall be pleased, rrrv 
brethren and sisters, to respond for a few moments to this call made on 
me by the President of the Church. In doing so, I desire that the bless- 
ings of the Lord shall be with me to direct what I shall say, for 1 
realize that of myself I am not capable of saying anything that will be 
profitable to you who have assembled this afternoon to be instructed 
upon the word of the Lord. Therefore I pray that the blessings of the 
Lord shall be with each of us, that our time here will not have been 
spent in vain. 

I was thrilled, beyond my words to express, with the meeting of 
this morning, by the spirit that was manifest, by the things that were 
uttered by the President of the Church, and by President Ivins, and 
also with the things we listened to this morning in the officers' meeting 
of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, and I am 
grateful that I have had this opportunity of assembling and listening 
to these valuable thoughts. I hope I shall get fresh inspiration from 
them, and from the meetings to follow in this conference, so that, as 
I return to the stake over which I preside, I may be able to carry back 
to the people the spirit of this great gathering and the valuable things 
imparted, and to be imparted, by the servants of the Lord called upon to 
speak to the Latter-day Saints. 

I thank the Lord, above all else, that I have a testimony concerning 
this great latter-day work. I hope and trust that this testimony the 
Lord has given to me will be an abiding one, that during the rest of 
my life I shall be able to retain it in my soul and make it a part of my 
very being. As I enjoy this blessing, my brethren and sisters, I desire 
that this same blessing may be upon you and upon every Latter-day 
Saint who has gone down into the waters of baptism, and had hands 
laid upon his head for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and who has 
been given a testimony concerning this great latter-day .work. I hope 
and pray that each one who has entered into covenants with his Maker 
may have the Holy Ghost to abide with them. 

I was impressed very much this morning in listening tO' what was 
said, and the words of the Savior came to me and have been upon m) 
mind since then. If you will bear with me for a moment, I would 
like to read some of his words, as recorded in the 14th chapter of 
St. John, beginning at the 14th verse : 

"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. 
"If ye love me, keep my commandments. 

"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that 
he may abide with you forever ; 

"Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth 
him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and 
shall be in you. 

"I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: 
because I live, ye shall live also. * * * 

"lie that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me : 
and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and 
will manifest myself to him." 

The very fact that we have gathered ourselves together in this confer- 
ence is an indication to me that we love the Lord and that we are exemp- 
lifying in our lives the words of the Redeemer of the world wherein he 
says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." , The people in this 
conference have gathered from all parts of the Church, some of them 
coming hundreds of miles, paying their own expenses on the railroads 
and in the hotels, and all because of their love for the Redeemer of the 
world and the work that he has established in the dispensation in which 
we live. We are sending missionaries into the nations, and to every 
part of the known world, with the message of the restored gospel, and 
they go out, as you are. aware, bearing their own expenses, meeting the 
scoffs and the scorns of the people of the world and many of them 
enduring the hardships because of the love they have for the gospel 
which has been made a part of their lives. Where else can you find 
such fove manifest in all the world as is shown by the Latter-day Saints, 
willing" upon every occasion (it matters not what the sacrifice might 
be) to go where they are sent, to' bear this message of glad tidings of 
great joy to people who do not know as we know, that the Redeemer 
of the world liveth? 

I rejoice in the fact that we have identified ourselves with an 
organization that has for its object the love of humanity. Members of 
this great organization realize the responsibility of carrying this great 
message to the nations, regardless of cost, regardless of their time and 
means, and even the sacrifice of their own lifes, if it becomes necessary. 
It is because of this love that our parents and our grandparents accepted 
the gospel in their native lands, and emigrated from the various parts 
of the world to this intermountain country, the place that the Lord 
spoke of through his servants as the dwelling place of latter-day Israel. 

I thank God that I was born of parents who had the love of God 
in their hearts, that when the gospel came to them they accepted it in 
the circumstances that it found them. They were willing to make 
sacrifice, willing to leave all that they had and journey westward to 
this land surrounded by these lofty peaks that we see on every hand. 
Many are the trials and hardships that our grandparents endured. My 
grandparents on my mother's side accepted the gospel in Sweden. 
They suffered much persecution prior to and during their journey here. 
They had but very little means to migrate to this western land. They 
had to stop upon various occasions and earn money, that they might 
continue their journey, and upon one occasion, when they were earning 
money in order that they might proceed upon their journey, it was neces- 
sary that they leave some of their children with friends. The friends with 
whom they left the children became attached to them, and when they had 



ELDER WILLIAM JONES 



65 



earned sufficient money to take them on a little farther, they went to 
gather their children. Some of the people were unwilling to give them 
up, and it was necessary for them to go into court in order to get them. 
They did so, and the court gave them their children, but after the court 
had decided in their favor and they went on their way, the people that 
were after some of their children waylaid them upon the road and took 
from them one boy, and from that day until the day of their death, thev 
never had the privilege of again beholding the face of that son. That 
is just one instance, my dear friends, of the many trials and hardships 
that they had to endure because of the love in their souls of the gospel. 
It enabled them to journey thousands of miles to this western country 
and establish their children here. Upon their foundation we can build, 
in the enjoyment of the blessings of the Lord. I rejoice with you that 
we are surrounded with the comforts that the Lord has blessed us with, 
that we have plenty to subsist upon, to make ourselves comfortable and 
happy, and that, above all else, we still retain in our hearts that same 
love manifest by our fathers and mothers who accepted the gospel in 
the land of their birth. This knowledge and this love came to them 
through earnest prayer and through seeking after the word of the Lord. r 
They were honest in heart, they desired to serve God and keep his 
commandments, and when the servants of the Lord found them, they 
recognized the voice of the true shepherd and embraced the truth, 
but it was because of earnest prayer and desire upon their part to know 
the will of the Lord, and to keep his commandments. The Lord has 
told us in the scripture that I have read to you that he will manifest 
himself to us. I bear witness to you that the Lord does manifest him- 
self to the Latter-day Saints. He may not do it by personal contact 
in each individual case, but, through the promptings of the Holy 
Ghost, he manifests himself to the Latter-day Saints from time 
to time as needed, that they may be kept in the path of truth 
and righteousness. I know beyond any doubt that if we study the 
Spirit of truth, the Holy Ghost, and put ourselves in condition to detect 
its promptings, that it will continue to manifest itself to us. But I 
want to say to you that it requires study. We must conduct ourselves ' 
in a way and manner that when the Lord speaks to us we may recognize 
his voice and carry out the instructions given to us as individuals. The 
Prophet Moroni, you know, gives the keynote, as recorded in the Book 
of Mormon, Moroni 10. The Lord says, speaking through Moroni : 

"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be 
wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful 
the Lord hath been unto the children of men, frcm the creation of Adam even 
down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are net true : 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he wilf manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

I bear record to you that our fathers and mothers, when the gospel 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



came to them, asked, as Moroni here gives us to understand, in His 
name, and when they asked, they received knowledge concerning the 
doctrines, as to whether ttoey were of men or of God. ■ The injunction 
given by the Savior, the Redeemer of the world, is that you ask in his 
name and you shall' know whether the doctrine is of man or whether 
they come from our heavenly Father. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us as individuals, as members of 
this great organization and as elders of Israel, that each one shall per- 
form 5 his part well, that we shall realize the responsibilities we owe 
one to another, and especially the responsibility that we owe to our 
heavenly Father in bearing our part, in helping to preach the gospel 
and do the work at home and abroad, for the salvation of the living as 
well as flie dead. I bear record that there is no joy, no pleasure, no 
happiness to be enjoyed in all the world, outside of the service of the 
Redeemer of the world. It matters not how much money men may have 
to spend in getting happiness in this world, there is no real joy outside of 
his service. I bear you this as my testimony, my brethren and sisters, 
in all humility, and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 

Assistant Church Historian 

It is an unexpected pleasure accorded me to be sent over from the 
Tabernacle to speak before this congregation, taking the place of some- 
one else who was expected to come. I shall not detain you for more 
than a few minutes ; but, while I am before you, I desire to bear my 
testimony : the testimony that we are endeavoring to establish in the 
hearts of the young people of Zion. The slogan of the Mutual Im- 
provement Associations for the current year, runs somewhat like this, 
"We stand for a testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith." 
We cannot be effective missionaries, promulgating the doctrines of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, unless we have a 
testimony of the divine calling of Joseph Smith, the prophet. We 
cannot have a testimony of his divine calling unless we have also a 
testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, 
the Redeemer of mankind. 

The arguments which establish faith in the divinity of our Lord 
and Savior apply particularly to the establishment of faith in the divine 
calling of Joseph Smith ; for Joseph Smith was raised up of God, and 
he received his commission through the personal ministry of the Father 
and the Son to bear witness that they live and are interested in the 
affairs of men. He had nothing to give the world except what they 
commanded him. His visions, visitations of angels and revelations were 
all directed by, and in the name of, the Lord to give to mankind anew 
the doctrines which Christ taught in the meridian of time with the 
ordinances and principles, organizations and governments necessary 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS

in the dispensation of the fulness of times to the establishment of the 
kingdom of God on earth; never to be taken from the earth, never to 
be given to another people ; but to remain here triumphant over every 
obstacle and foe, over all other governments and institutions of men. 
Associated thus as the testimony of the divinity of Christ is with the 
testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith, how invaluable, my 
brethren and sisters, it is to us. What distinction a testimony of the 
truth of Joseph's mission gives us, and what joy, in going about in 
the midst of our fellow creatures upon the face of the earth, even among 
those professing Christianity, to say nothing of those of the heathen 
world ! 

We are called upon, because of the testimony that we do receive 
concerning Joseph Smith's mission, to be instructors, to be leaders. 
We cannot be otherwise. I will illustrate it. Take_ our young men 
called to go as missionaries to the various nations of the earth. Usually 
the injunction put upon them, in the blessings they receive when they 
are set apart, is to get the spirit of their mission — the spirit of their 
mission! I remember President Brigham Young said to me when he 
laid his hands upon my head, "Get the spirit of your mission." My 
father's only instruction was, "Get the spirit of your mission ; do not 
know too much, but believe all you can." I did not know at the time 
what that sentence meant, but I was not long in my field of labor 
before I discovered it. There came upon me the spirit of my mission. 
Now, what was that? It was the exercise of the gift of the Holy 
Ghost conferred upon me when I was a child. It was the exercise of 
the authority to minister in the name of Jesus Christ, given me when 
I was ordained an elder. I found within three weeks after engaging 
in my mission that I was veritably, in effectiveness I will say mildly, 
an authorized representative of the Savior of this world ; having the 
right to speak in his name, having the right to call upon my fellow 
creatures to repent ; promising them that if they would do so they would 
receive forgiveness of their sins ; showing them the way and proving it. 

Does not all that constitute leadership among men? What would 
not the ministers of the world give for so potent a power, so actual 
an authority? It cannot come and it has not come and does not, in 
this world, in this time, in this generation, in this age of the world, 
except through the ministry of Joseph Smith, whom God called, and 
to whom the Father appeared, to whom the Son spoke and delivered 
that message of life and salvation to all the children of God that dwell 
upon the face of the whole earth. Joseph Smith knew that he had 
that vision ; he could not deny it. A minister tried to get him to ; his 
supposed friends, his associates, his relatives, and others tried to 
dissuade him from the assertion that he had seen such a vision, had 
received such an authority, had obtained such power ; but he knew 
whereof he spoke, and in the integrity of his heart he maintained his 
testimony and he maintained it throughout his life to the day of his 
death. He sealed that testimony with the blood of a martyr for the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



truth, not less, but for God and the truth, for the fact that God is 
and had spoken to him, and had delivered through him a message 
to all of his children. 

My brethren and sisters, I would not speak* thus if I were not 
able to bear witness that V have received such a testimony. I know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet, not alone because of the spirit, I will 
say, of my mission, which confirmed that testimony and that knowledge, 
and indeed awakened my soul to its reality and to know the life of 
Joseph Smith — I have studied it. 

I remember one day in England, President George A. Smith, 
first counselor to President Brigham Young, . was upon his return 
journey home after having visited Europe and Asia, the Holy Land, 
and he sent for me to come and stay with him at the little hotel in 
London, and to be his companion and guide for about ten days, during 
which time we visited a great many places of note, of historical interest 
and value. I knew them pretty well, for I had been there for more 
than a year. We also visited a great many notable people. We were 
taken by noblemen of England to their homes. We were entertained 
at their tables. We were taken into the House of Lords and House of 
Commons and the Law Courts. We were shown by several men of 
renown courtesies and attentions that were in exchange for courtesies 
and attention they had received, perhaps, as travelers going across the 
continent and stopping for a few days in Salt Lake City. 

It was most delightful for me, an education to accompany Presi- 
dent George A. Smith, who was a historian and who knew history. 
We would go into St. Paul's Cathedral, for instance, and stand before 
statues of generals, men of letters, and men of renown of one kind 
and another, and he would tell me little personal incidents in their 
lives. My accompanying him was one of the most valuable educational 
incidents in my life. But I have not time to dwell upon that, but upon 
this : Before he left London to come home he said to me, "Junius, I 
want to see if it is possible to find the home of my ancestors ; the 
place that they went from in going to America. They went to America 
about the year 1635. They settled in Topsfield, Essex county, Massa- 
chusetts, and that is the only clue I have as to where they might have 
gone from in England. Can you find Topsfield, Essex county, 
England?" "Well," said I, "I have been all over Essex county, because 
my field of labor was there, but I do not recall Topsfield." So I 
got a geography and searched but there is no Topsfield in all England 
spelled as it is in Massachusetts. There is a place in Essex county 
named Toppesfield, and I presume it would be pronounced Topsfield. 
He said, "That is near enough." So we set out, took a train to a 
station, not knowing we could have gone nearer; that was seventeen 
miles away from that little country village upon the Colne river, in 
Essex. Then we hired a trap and rode across country for seventeen 
miles, a beautiful drive. We came to the little village of Toppesfield, 
and it was nightfall, and we went into the inn there to stay over night, 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 



69 



the "Green Man Inn." Before we retired we ordered supper. Brother 
George A. could not wait for supper nor wait for morning, but thought 
we should try and see if we could not confirm the suspicion that we 
were on the sacred ground that was trodden by his ancestors. And so 
we went into the churchyard, and I got down on my knees before 
headstones and traced out the inscriptions with my finger. Presently 
I came upon some Smiths, upon some Thomas Smiths, Samuel Smiths, 
the same names that were among the Smiths, and one generation ahead 
of those that were found in Topsfield, Essex county, Massachusetts. 
Brother George A. Smith said, "We have struck the right lead. Let 
us go and get some supper." And so we went back to the little inn 
and had a very delicious supper of country things — some fresh eggs, 
and home-cured ham, and some lettuce, and pepper grass, I remember, 
and some other things. The reason I mentioned those is because of 
something witty that Brother George A. said. In the course of the 
supper, after eating quite heartily, he said, "Junius, pass the forage" — 
referring to the green stuff. 

After supper, we went up into an upper bed room. It was under 
a thatched roof with a dormer window. There was a little old fashioned 
bedstead, and there we knelt down by the side of the bed and Brother 
George A. Smith poured out his heart in prayer and in thanksgiving to 
the Almighty. George A. Smith knew that the gospel was restored to 
the earth. George A. Smith knew that God had appeared to Joseph, 
his kinsman, and had revealed the everlasting gospel. He knew that 
Joseph Smith had been true to his testimony. He poured out his heart 
and soul in prayer, and in that prayer he thanked God for the oppor- 
tunity he had had of going abroad, of traveling over Europe and meeting 
the peoples of the different nations, of going to the Holy Land, and 
of traversing spots that were made sacred to us because the Savior 
of the world had trodden those same paths and places. He had seen 
all that. Then he came to this humble little village in Essex and said, 
"And above all, O Lord, I thank thee that I am permitted to tread the 
lanes that were trodden by my ancestors, that I am permitted to receive 
here information that will open the doors for those of my kindred that 
have gone before, and may do a work for them that will effect their 
salvation eternally, according to the gospel revealed through thy serv- 
ant, Joseph." I could almost repeat his prayer ; I never before listened 
to such a prayer. I never before felt that I was so near, so close to the 
Almighty. I will say, yes, I never before felt the nearness of the 
Savior of the world as I felt it while we knelt in that room and Brother 
George A. Smith poured out his soul in thanksgiving and praise to God. 

Well now, from that time I have studied and followed the history 
of the Smiths. I have written a good deal upon it. I have had the 
privilege of doing some things to help to commemorate and hold up in 
honor his name before mankind — the name of Joseph Smith, unto whom 
the angel of God, Moroni, standing before him said, "I am a messenger 
sent from the presence of God to you," as he called him by name, 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"and there is a work for you to do, and your name shall be spoken for 
good and for evil among all people, and nations and kindreds and 
tongues. It shall be had for good and for evil among all nations." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I will clinch my personal testimony. 
I have a right to. I know through traveling very extensively in the 
world, pretty well all over Europe, having crossed the Atlantic Ocean 
ten times, and pretty well all over America, for I have been in every 
state but two, and among this people called "Mormons." You know, 
young men and young women — who were young when I was — you know 
whether I have borne my testimony. It is this: I have discovered 
that the world has spoken the name of Joseph Smith for evil; they 
have traduced his name ; they have wickedly attempted to break down 
and destroy the influence of his mission ; they have lied about his 
kindred, about his ancestors, about his family, about their lives. I 
went all through that in Vermont and in New York. I have said time 
and again to people there, "Why, Joseph Smith and his family were 
just like you and your families," and proved it to them. "Go to the 
records, in building your churches, your schools, and in holding every 
office that anybody else held. They had the respect of their neighbors. 
They were industrious, they were upright, they were an honorable 
family, and here their descendants are, holding up their names in honor. 
And we, Latter-day Saints, a million of us, have held up Joseph Smith's 
name in honor, that his name might be spoken for good." 

This is my testimony to you, as I have said to many people, while 
standing on the hearthstone of the cottage where he was born, where 
his mother washed and dressed him as a babe. Over the mantle-piece 
there is hung his portrait by the side of his mother's, at the other side 
his brother Hyrum's, and under Joseph Smith's painted portrait, framed 
in a little gold frame, are the printed words which I have just quoted 
to you, from the lips of Moroni, saying that his name should be spoken 
for good and evil. I have said to hundreds, and those who have 
succeeded me in the management of that memorial in Vermont have 
said to thousands since, "Read that now ; you of the world, unbelievers 
in 'Mormonism,' have been speaking the name of Joseph Smith for 
evil ; we Latter-day Saints have built this monument and this memorial 
to show our love, our admiration and our testimony and bearing our 
witness for good, that his name might be spoken for good. So, between 
you and us we have fulfilled the words of the angel of God, and proved 
Joseph Smith, who quoted them and gave them to the world, a prophet 
of God." 

May the Lord bless us all with a testimony that shall abide in our 
souls, a light to our paths, a guide to our,, footsteps. There is nothing 
so precious as this ; there is no truth so certain as this ; there is no 
institution, there is no purpose of Almighty God, against whom none 
can prevail, so certain as the triumph of this work known as the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Amen. 



ELDER A. E. PARKS

ELDER A. E. PARKS 

President of the Gunnison Stake 

My brethren and sisters: I do not suppose that I shall again have 
the same peculiar feeling that I had when my name was announced 
in the conference this morning, as a speaker for this afternoon's session. 
It was a feeling of great fear, and yet into my heart came a desire to 
perform the mission that the president of the Church had called me to 
perform. I came into this building with the same fear — a fear of you 
and a fear of myself, but as I heard you sing that wonderful song, 
"Redeemer of Israel, our only delight," the fear of you left me, 
because I knew that I should have the privilege of talking to men and 
women who had in their hearts a testimony of the gospel, and that 
when the spirit of that testimony was upon them, who had time and 
again borne testimony to the fact that they knew God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, the son of the living God, that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the true and living God, and that notwithstanding their 
many weaknesses, God had blessed them. I knew that I would have 
the privilege of talking to men and women who, in their hours of 
trial, had called into their homes the bishop of their ward, the president 
of their stake, who had been with them, who had laid hands upon the 
heads of their loved ones and to their loved ones had come health 
and strength, and into their hearts had come the peace of the gospel, 
and my fear of you had [left me entirely, though for myself it still 
remains, that I might not have the ability, the power to make the 
contact with the Spirit of our Father in heaven that might leave a 
message with you today. May I not ask that the few moments I stand 
before you that you offer a silent prayer in my behalf, that God may 
give me the power to say something that you may carry home, that will 
make you a little better, make you a little happier, that will give us 
a little more power that we may perform the mission to which God 
has called us, and also that he will give to you an understanding heart, 
that what I say may find lodgment therein? 

I know, brethren and sisters, beyond the shadow of doubt, that 
there is in this gospel of Jesus Christ a power beyond the power of men, 
that will take men and women of mediocre ability and raise them up 
and magnify them so that they may perform a wonderful service to 
which they have been called by God, so that they may perform the 
service of representing our Father in heaven upon this earth, so that 
they may come to the people and convey to them, under the authority 
of God, the power of the Priesthood, that they may be changed in 
their minds, so that the Spirit of God may actuate them, may impel them 
forward to do the thing that God would have them do. 

I think there is one principle of the gospel that is more important, 
probably, than all else, and it is that of which I wanted to speak this 
afternoon. It is this principle announced by our Savior, through Joseph 
Smith, that we should be one, and if we are not one, we are not his. 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The question has often come to me, "How may we be one?" It has 
come to you, too, I know. Some of our brethren and sisters think 
that it is to carry out their own particular ideas, their own views, and 
a few have gotten together and tried to carry them out. I do not 
believe that it is true. I believe that when the Lord said we should be 
one, he meant that we should be one with those who preside over us, 
be one with the prophet of God. Is not that true? The Lord has 
said some marvelous and wonderful things for the blessing of those 
who would be in harmony with those whom he calls to leadership. 
In the matter of priesthood, he says, in the 84th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

. "For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which 
T have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit 
unto the renewing of their bodies. 

"They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of 
Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God. 

"And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord ; 

"For he that receiveth me receiveth my Father ; 

"And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore 
all that my Father hath shall be given unto him." 

How could that be possible, that all the Father hath should be 
given unto them? ,And to make it sure. 

"This is according to the oath and covenants, which belongeth to the 
priesthood, * * * which he cannct break, neither can it be moved. * *" 

And I have often wondered how it could be, how I could be one 
with God, how we could be one with God. And a testimony of it came 
to me. We shall never have the authority of God ; he will always 
preside. . We brethren who have received the Priesthood have received 
authority to act in the name of God, and to the extent of that authority 
we may act, and any act we perform in righteousness under that 
authority is a binding act and God will recognize it. But there needs 
to come something else into our lives, and that is, if we would be one 
with God, if we would have the power of God, we must exercise that 
Priesthood, must magnify it by our lives, by our clean living, and by 
our service. 

It is a wonderful testimony borne to you by Brother Junius F. 
Wells, who received the spirit of his calling and was the means in the 
hands of God of establishing our wonderful Young Men's Mutual 
Improvement Association. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the Lord has said that the time 
would come that those who would not receive the servants of the 
Lord, nor hear the words of the prophets and apostles, and the 
servants of the Lord, should be cut, off from among the people. 
The prophet Mormon bore that testimony but he said some other 
marvelous things. There is one marvelous promise, with which I 
am going to close, after warning you, if I may, against those who 
would come into your lives and sow the seeds of discord and put 
a bar between you and the men whom God has called to lead this 



ELDER A. E. PARKS 



73 



Church ; between you and the bishop of your ward, or the ward teachers, 
or the president of the stake, or the president of the Church. I would 
warn you that those men and women who would do this are not actuated 
with the spirit of God but by the spirit of evil. I will read to you what 
the Lord says in regard to that in the 121st section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

"Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith 
the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith 
the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I com- 
manded them. 

"But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of 
sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves. 

"And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring 
them into bondage and death — 

"Wo unto them ; because they have offended my little ones they shall be 
severed from the ordinances of mine house. 

"Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, 
and they themselves shall be despised by those that flattered them." 

Let me read again : 

"But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, 
and are the children of disobedience themselves." 

Do not .permit it. As you love your lives, your salvation, the 
salvation of your boys and girls, brethren and sisters, never let a word 
be said in your house or hearing against the constituted servants of the 
Lord, because I tell you, when they go out of the way, the Lord him- 
self will remove them, that his people will not be deceived. But there 
is one thing, brethren and sisters, that you can do, and it will make a tie 
between yourselves and our Father in heaven, between your children and 
our>Father in heaven that can never be broken — they may drift one way 
or another, but ultimately they will come back and receive the blessings 
of the gospel — and that is the thing that the Lord has revealed in the 
21st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which he said: 

"Wherefore, meaning the Church, thou shalt give heed unto all his [speaking 
of the president of the Church] words and commandments which he shall give 
unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me ; 

"For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience 
and faith." 

Here is the most wonderful promise, one which would make this 
gospel an absolutely vital force in your lives : 

"For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you ; 
yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, 
and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory." 

I want to leave with you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, 
that I do know beyond the shadow of a doubt that God does operate 
through these men whom he has called to lead in Israel. You may go to 
your bishop with any problem, and if you will act on his advice given 
you as you go prayerfully to receive it, you may know it is the word 
of God to you. You may go to the president of the stake and president 
of the Church in their proper order, and receive that same blessing. T 
do know that President Heber J. Grant is the prophet of God, and i-

actuated by the power of God, and the counsel he gives us in these 
conferences is the word of God, the living scripture to us, and if 
we obey it, we and our families may return to the presence of God 
and receive those blessings that are ours. May this be the lot of all of 
us, I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I desire to endorse all that has been said concerning the di- 
vinity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who came in the 
meridian of time and at the close of his earthly mission died that we 
might live ; also all that has been said concerning the divine mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith whose spirit was reserved to come 
upon the earth in the latter days to establish the gospel of Jesus 
Christ again, with all its powers and keys and blessings. It is the 
privilege of every Latter-day Saint to know that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, and that the Prophet Joseph Smith was 
divinely appointed and ordained for the great work which he per- 
formed in his brief ministry in these latter days. No Latter-day 
Saint should be satisfied until these testimonies burn within him. 

It is the mission of this Church to declare to the world these 
two great truths. The Christian world toda}' is greatly concerned 
with the problem of the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, 
and this problem arises from the lack of testimony concerning these 
two great personages. Confusion and dissension will be with the 
churches of the earth until they conform to the laws and ordinances 
of the gospel. The members of these churches will have to exercise 
faith in the Redeemer as the Son of God and sincerely repent of their 
sins ; then go down into the waters of baptism for the remission of 
these sins, and receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands 
by those who have authority to do so. Then by prayer, faithful- 
ness, obedience, humility and meekness they may obtain a testi- 
mony of Jesus Christ and Joseph Smith, knowing that Jesus is the 
Redeemer of the world and that through the Prophet Joseph the 
gospel was restored to the earth. 

The work of the Lord is moving rapidly. More missionaries 
are in the field than ever before. Mature men are sparing time to 
go into the mission field again for a period of about six months, 
and they have carried the message of the gospel to old acquaint- 
ances as well as new. It is hoped that from year to year the num- 
ber of missionaries who are carrying the gospel message to the 
inhabitants of the earth will increase. 

Another temple is almost finished, being located in Mesa, 
Arizona. Five temples are now in daily operation, and this new one 
will, no doubt, be ready early in the coming year. It has been built 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



75 



from the donations and gifts of the Latter-day Saints and from the 
tithes. It is a wonderful building, everything being of the latest in 
temple architecture. Thousands of men and women are waiting 
to enter that House of the Lord to do ordinance work for the living 
and the dead. 

Elder Junius F. Wells mentioned the old landmarks of the 
Church, the Memorial Farm in Vermont, the Hill Cumorah in New 
York, and other places. The Church has recently acquired the farm 
of Father Peter Whitmer in Fayette, Seneca county, New York, 
consisting of about one hundred and twenty acres of land. It was 
on this farm that the Church was organized on the sixth day of 
April, 1830. Some may say, Why purchase this property? I am 
satisfied that the day will come when these historic places will be 
visited by tourists and Latter-day Saints in great numbers, who 
will stand in reverence in such hallowed spots. On this farm, and 
probably in the very house on it, the first Sacrament was admin- 
istered by the Prophet, after those present had gone through the 
formality of organizing the Church in accordance with the laws 
of the State of New York. 

The late President Seymour B. Young spent years of his life 
in trying to gather sufficient funds to erect on the Temple Block 
here in Salt Lake City a. memorial to those who came across the 
plains with hand-carts, people who came mainly from England, 
Scotland and Scandinavia. With these companies were a few 
wagons, carrying some of the people's heavy belongings, and also 
carrying food. The remainder of their effects was placed in hand- 
carts, which were pulled for a thousand miles or more across the 
plains, where the only road was the trail made by the wagons that 
had gone before. A beautiful monument in memory of these brave 
people is now cast in enduring bronze and is placed in the front 
entrance to the Bureau of Information. Do not go home until you 
have looked at it, thought about it, and seen how the artist has 
depicted the sufferings of the Latter-day Saints, showing the pathos 
of it, showing the indomitable spirit that brought these people 
across the plains. 

One of the great Christian churches has held a celebration in 
the United States, during which special stress was given to the 
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Because of statements found in 
the Bible, this Church declares in its doctrines that when the wafer 
or bread and the wine are blessed they are actually transformed into 
the. body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Such instances as 
this show 'how important it is that the Latter-day Saint", should 
have prophets and apostles who may receive the word of the Lord 
in this day and properly interpret the instructions given in former 
days. 

The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is one of the most solemn 
services that the Latter-day Saints hold. In these latter days,- the 
first Sacrament was administered in the home of Father Whitmer, 
as stated before, according to instructions contained in section 20 of 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the book of Doctrine and Covenants. This Sacrament was insti- 
tuted by Jesus Christ on the eve of his crucifixion. 

Shortly before his death he had raised Lazarus from the dead. 
It had become known in all the region round about that he had 
done this, and thousands of people who were gathering for the 
Passover heard of it. His enemies, the Pharisees, chief priests and 
scribes, were afraid of his popularity. He visited the temple and 
the voice of the Father was heard acknowledging him to be his 
Son. The following day he visited the temple again and drove out 
the money changers,, and that was the last time he entered that 
sacred building. He resided with his friends in Bethany, where a 
feast was held at the home of Lazarus. The day following, Wednes- 
day, he gave his disciples private and final instructions in some 
secluded place on the Mount of Olives. On 'Thursday he asked his 
disciples to prepare for the feast, and no doubt that remarkable 
ceremony was carried out in the style customary to the Galileans, 
for all the disciples of Jesus were Galileans, with the exception of 
Judas Iscariot. The supper being over, he took off his outer gar- 
ments, girded himself with a towel, and washed the feet of his, 
disciples. Peter objected, but when his Master told him that if he 
did not do this he would have no part or lot with him, the impulsive 
man said, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." 
After that, he gave his disciples some advice and encouragement and 
uttered that (wonderful prayer contained in the 17th chapter of 
John. And then he brake bread and blessed it and gave it to his 
disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is my body; as oft as ye meet do 
this in remembrance of me. Then, after this had been partaken of 
by those present in the room, he blessed the wine and said, Drink, 
for this is my blood which is shed. No doubt the disciples par- 
took of this solemnly and remembered his injunction that as oft as 
they should meet they should do this in remembrance of his suf- 
ferings and death. 

He left no ritual, he did not say how the religious ordinances 
of the new Christian Church, composed of his followers and be- 
lievers, should be carried out. It is presumed that he expected they 
would carry out the old Jewish services, but in addition to this He 
said, in effect : As oft as ye meet, partake of the emblems of my: 
body and blood in the shape of bread and wine, and do this in re- 
membrance of me. Evidently he gave to his disciples the true form 
of prayer which he desired them to repeat when blessing the bread 
and the wine, and that same prayer has been given to the Latter- 
day Saints and is contained in section 20 of the book of ■ Doctrine 
and Covenants. 

No Latter-day Saint can keep alive in his heart the testimony 
of Jesus Christ and live the gospel unless he partakes of the Sac- 
rament of the Lord's Supper frequently, with clean hands and a 
pure heart, remembering the purpose of this Sacrament is to remind 
us of the death and sufferings of our Lord and Master until he 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



77 



comes again. We Latter-day Saints should go to our meeting- 
places regularly and in the most solemn manner center our thoughts 
upon the great sacrifice made by our Lord and Savior; and we 
should not partake pf the bread and the water unthinkingly or 
carelessly. This partaking of the Sacrament should be done on 
the Lord's day, for on that day the Lord has said we should go to 
his house and partake of his Sacrament. 

May the Lord bless us that we may sense our responsibilities 
and privileges as Latter-day Saints, I humbly pray in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

My brethren and sisters: The great inspiring idea of this con- 
ference to me has been the admonition of Christ : "Rise up and be 
God's child." God created man in his own image, and the divine 
within man teaches him the truth and value of character and right- 
eousness based upon a supreme faith in the Father of us all. The 
Latter-day Saints hold sacredly to the fundamental teachings of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In all their history they have 
believed that Christ is the sure guide to the way of life. This was 
true of the brave souls who crossed the plains in the very early 
days and made their way to Zion here in the tops of the mountains. 

The handcart immigrants mentioned by the previous speaker 
suffered untold hardships, not for the purpose of obtaining wealth 
and power, but fundamentally for the glorification of God and 
bringing to pass his divine purposes. May I just add a thought 
or two more concerning the handcart pioneers. Like their other 
brethren and sisters who came to Utah in the days of the old trail 
by ox-team and on foot, they did a great deed ; and the result of 
their work stands ineffaceable and beyond forgetfulness. They 
had strong characters and unyielding courage. They came to work 
out their destiny. Religious freedom was one of their motives, 
and they possessed a very fine and lofty courage, and are to 
be reverently admired by all the people of this state. They put 
above all things the possessions of the mind and the heart. When 
they achieved their purpose, through much tribulation and suffer- 
ing, they opened their doors to the honest in heart, and told them 
to enter. In the law of progress, these pioneers stand forth as 
_ exemplars of certain great principles, which never can grow old. 
They set character first ; and reverenced intellectual and religious 
achievement. 

President Brigham Young saw this wilderness country in radiant 
vision, and the unconquered soil was a symbol of spiritual regeneration. 
And what did those pioneers of yesterday, and the Saints of today stand 
for? It is the gospel of Christ Jesus which speaks to us with so much 
power that it cannot be mistaken. It is a revelation of the meaning and 
responsibility of life. It involves great and illuminating ideas and truths 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that if mankind will work for them, the security of the race in peace 
and understanding will be assured. If we take a general view of 
Christ's teachings we will find that they emphasized the truth 
of the Kingdom of God and its coming; that he taught the Father- 
hood of God and the infinite value of the human soul, and .that 
out of his teachings grow the higher righteousness and the com- 
mandment of love. Louder and more confident voices proclaim 
these truths today, because in the infinite goodness and mercy of 
God his divine Priesthood has been restored, and man has again 
been made free to find eternal life. 

It is religion, the love of God and neighbor, which, gives life 
radiancy ; and in this divine feeling we realize better the meaning 
and aim of life. The knowledge of the meaning of God's Kingdom 
grows steadily and silently in the heart of the man who grows in 
faith and allows his soul to be illumined by the spirit of Christ our Lord. 
This Kingdom of the Master can be understood only from within. While 
the Kingdom of heaven is to come to us, it will be understood only 
by our spiritual natures. Every doctrine that he taught was a 
message of the Kingdom. 

God placed a value on the human soul, and taught that it is 
capable of endless spiritual and intellectual development. The 
Glory of God is intelligence; so intelligence is the glory of man. 
This glory is the Spirit of truth, which "leads man into all truth." 
The soul is man perfected, and a man perfected is one who knows 
not only truth, but is "a man of the truth." 

What a divine duty the gospel of Christ imposes upon you and 
me ; the duty to develop our spirits and intellects to the highest 
degree and to their infinite possibilities. Then there is the higher 
righteousness and the commandment of love. When Jesus was 
asked what the great commandment is, he replied : "Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy mind * * * and thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself." This is a sphere of ethical thought that is peculiarly 
expressive of the gospel of Christ. It is in this sense that Jesus 
combined religion and morality. The higher morality depends 
upon the conception of Christ's teachings, and the developing of 
the simple faith in God. No system of ethics has ever bettered 
this system of the Master, and the pure Christian virtues are the most 
secure force today to heal the sins and ills of the world. The world 
cannot be far from religious feeling. Religion is a natural out- 
growth in man. When man began to think and feel and wonder, he 
had longings to find out the infinite. So he naturally came to God, 
and God blessed him with divine power. "Wherever there is man, 
there is religion." My friends, we cannot be much until we have 
touched the infinite religion of spirits. Step by step we must rise 
to the demand of religion, and set before us the aesthetic ideals of 
Christ, our Lord, and abide by his thought that the love of God is the 
abhorrence of evil. Jesus had a great loving world purpose. There

cannot be true victory in life until every activity of man — economic, 
political, social, ethical, and intellectual — be influenced by the divine pur- 
pose of Christ, our Lord. That is victory. 

I must not speak longer. May God help us to see the greater 
laws of righteousness ; may he strengthen our testimonies from 
day to day. May we lift up our thoughts to him, and know that 
life and light come as we approach God. It was a mighty sage 
who wrote : "God ever works with him who works with God." 
The religion of Christ has a personal appeal to us all. "Let the 
wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and 
let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him ; and 
to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Amen. 

The choir sang, "God is our refuge and strength." 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder Orson Allen of the 
Ensign stake. 



SECOND DAY 

MORNING SESSION 

The Tabernacle was comfortably filled, both on the lower floor and 
in the galleries, when President Heber J. Grant, on Monday morning, 
10 o'clock, October 4, 1926, announced that the congregation would 
sing, as the opening hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Following the spirited singing, Elder George H. Brimhall offered 
the opening prayer. 

A sacred soprano solo was sung by Pearl Kimball Davis^ entitled, 
"Eye hath not seen." 

> 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

I have enjoyed greatly, my brethren and sisters, the addresses 
and the music of this conference. My soul has been fed. I always 
delight to know that I belong to an organization that speaks with 
authority, and I glory in the fact that those who stand at the head of 
this great Church exercise the right of their authority. May I add 
to President Grant's remarks that whenever we sing the hymn, "We 
thank thee O God for a prophet," we have in mind Joseph Smith, the 
prophet of the restoration, and also the living prophet whom we sustain 
and uphold, and who guides us, under God's inspiration, in his day. 

THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK 

Perhaps the most impressive thought that comes to me as I look 
over these vast congregations of Latter-day Saints and recall all that 
they represent in social and economic conquest and in rich spiritual 
living, is that all this has come out of a very simple beginning. A lad, 
seeking for truth, cried in the darkness for light. Out of that simple, 
humble beginning, has come this mighty work. In my reading I turn 
most frequently to the Prophet Joseph Smith's own story of his first 
vision, and I return invariably refreshed and strengthened, inspired 
and thrilled, by that simple story. Joseph Smith, not yet fifteen years 
of age, in the midst of contending religious opinions, set out to find 
the truth. To God, the .author of truth, he stated his desire and the 
Father, in his graciousness, in his mercy, gave to the boy that for 
which he asked. 

THE FIRST VISION A LESSON TO ALL 

It seems to me that this Church has been given no greater lesson — 
one that should be remembered by the Church by -all people and by 
every individual. Men cannot live'by untruth or near truth. Spiritual 
contentment is won only when one has the full truth, or the truth 
just as fully as it may be available to him. Out of such individual 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



81 



desire and search for truth has come this great body of people, men 
and women, who know for themselves — they 'having gone to God in 
their search — that this is the truth. In this Church and kingdom we 
stand Upon individual testimonies of the truth. We depend not upon 
the prophet, great though he may be, who guides the Church at this 
time, or upon any other man, but we, having a witness of the spirit, 
know for ourselves that this is the truth. Out of such training, desire 
and high knowledge has come a people the like of which has not been 
known before upon the face of the earth — a kingdom of priests and 
priestesses such as the prophets of old dreamed about and wrote about. 

TRUTH DEFINED 

In one of the great revelations given to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, now known as Section 93, there is a splendid discussion of 
truth. In that section there is a comprehensive definition of truth. 
"Truth is knowledge of things as they are and as they were and as 
they iare to come." 

ALL TRUTH ACCEPTED 

It is a happy claim, and may I say a proud claim on the part of 
Latter-day Saints, that they accept all truth, no matter whence it comes, 
or what its nature may be, whether it be scientific, philosophical or re- 
ligious. If it be the truth, we accept it, and know that there is a place 
for it in the great plan of truth, known as the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
We Latter-day Saints welcome the great advances of these latter days. 
The remarkable conquests in pure and applied science : the telegraph, 
the telephone, the radio, the airplane, all the marvels of this day, we 
accept gladly and have no quarrel with them. Whenever the chemist 
discovers, as a few months ago, an element that had not been known 
before, we Latter-day Saints welcome that new knowledge, for we 
recognize that another step toward the ultimate conquest of nature, and 
of the universe, has been taken by man through the inspiration and 
good will of our Heavenly Father. When the astronomer tells us that 
a new star has been found in the high heavens, we are glad that more 
truth has come to us and therefore greater power. We support those 
who, in the laboratory or in the field, as earnest and honest searchers 
after truth, are seeking to unravel the mysteries of this great universe. 
As a Church we support such endeavors and sustain those who labor 
in the search of truth, no matter what the truth may be. 

RELATIVE VALUE OF TRUTH 

While Latter-day Saints understand that all truth is from God, 
and is desirable, and will be ours in time, yet we also know that all 
truth is not of equal value to humanity. Some knowledge is ,chiefly 
of physical help. It makes possible houses and roads and automobiles, 
and it feeds the body, thus making it easier for us to live on this 
earth. Another type of knowledge feeds the mind. Literature, art, 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and many other branches of knowledge contribute chiefly to the up- 
building of man's intellect. While we accept all these things, grateful 
for physical conveniences, glad to have the opportunity of mental 
development, yet Latter-day Saints understand that the truth of the 
greatest worth to humanity is that which controls and shapes human 
actions, that which interprets to us our relationship to God, our Maker, 
and to our fellowman; that which lays before us the great plan of 
salvation and explains why I am here, whence I came, where I am going 
and what I must do to conform to the greater laws of life. Such knowl- 
edge becomes the greater truth. Men frequently fail to understand 
the relative value of truth, and, therefore, set things that minister only 
to the physical world upon high pedestals, and place low the truth that 
deals with man's eternal journey, and with his eternal relationship to the 
greatest Being in the universe. It would not be quite wise or consistent 
for any one of us, no matter what views he may hold, to say that men 
of the- type of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, of Moses, Elijah and John 
the Baptist and of other notables who knew little about the great dis- 
coveries of the last hundred years, were not so great in stature before 
God and before men as we are. They did possess the higher and more 
valuable knowledge and they were seekers also after the lesser knowl- 
edge; and in our day, were they here, they would stand as we do, 
lovers of all truth, but with a clear understanding, that some truth.? 
minister to man's greatest and others to his lesser needs. 

RELATIVE VALIDITY OF TRUTH 

Not only do Latter-day Saints distinguish carefully between the 
greater and the lesser truths, but they also recognize that not all 
truth has the same validity. We cannot accept all knowledge as being of 
equal certainty. Some knowledge I know to be absolutely certain, some 
appears to be true, and some I hope may be true. The man who looks 
through a microscope into the infinitely small is limited in his search 
for knowledge by the power of that instrument. He can go no further. 
The man who looks through a telescope into the starry heavens must 
guess at the things that hang just beyond the reach of the instrument: 
and the man who builds a theory out of observed facts builds only 
a ladder, a scaffolding, by which he hopes to rise into that greater truth 
for which he seeks. Therefore, Latter-day Saints are careful to ex- 
amine the validity of the truths set before them. We make the satis- 
fying claim that the truth of greatest validity, that of greatest certainty, 
is the truth that has come from the mouth of God by revelation to his 
children in this and in every age through the history of the world. Is 
the microscope a great instrument for the gaining of knowledge? Is 
the telescope a great instrument for the obtaining of knowledge? If 
they are, then man himself, with his immortal spirit, may be able to 
touch the unseen forces of life, to learn from the spirit of the Al- 
mighty, who is the greatest revealer of knowledge. Through the spirit 
of man God may speak with greater power and with greater con- 
viction than through any man-made instrument. In this Church we 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



83 



stand firmly, before all the world, upon the doctrine that that which the 
Lord has revealed to his children directly is of the highest value and of 
the greatest validity. Upon revealed truth will be built, as the years 
go on, the whole structure of truth. 

READ SECTION 93 

I delight to know that I can build in this manner the philosophy of 
my life ; that I can thus accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, the existence 
of Almighty God, my relationship to him, and his words given to his 
prophets at various times in the history of mankind ; and that beginning 
with such knowledge I can accept, step by step and fact by fact, all 
knowledge and all truth as they come through any channel here on 
earth and in the hereafter. I would suggest to all Latter-day Saints that' 
they study section 93 of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, in which 
the truth, our eternal quest for it, its meaning, and the fundamental 
nature of the truths of heaven, are beautifully set forth. 

I am grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ. I thank God for the 
possession of it. I pray God to be with us and bless us, to be able to 
search out truth continually, to live it, to accept it, to make it a part 
of our lives, to grow in it !daily, and yet to understand in our search 
clearly and reasonably the limitations placed upon us so that we may. 
not be carried away by those who do not understand the full truth, 
and, having made a wrong beginning, may lead us to an incorrect end. 

God bless us and be with us continually, I pray, in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

It is not expected, brethren and sisters, that any new doctrine or 
revelation will be brought to the people at this time. 

WHERE THE WORD OF THE LORD IS FOUND 

The word of the Lord is to be found in reasonably full measure 
in the standard works of the Church — in the Bible, in the Book of 
Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. 
Any man or woman who can master these sacred books, so to speak, will 
be fully informed as to the purposes of the Lord. 

When further scripture, or revelation, is needed for the guidance of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it will be given by the 
Lord through the President of the Church who is the prophet of God. 

A GREAT MYSTERY EXPLAINED 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation, to 
all who believe, to the Jews first and also to the Greek. The doctrines 
of the gospel are set forth in the scriptures in simple language, and in 
great plainness ; but, strange to say, the natural man cannot comprehend 
them, for the apostle tells us in I Corinthians, 2: "But the natural 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God ; for they are foolish- 
ness unto him : neither can he know them, because they are spiritually 
discerned." 

"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of 
man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, 
but the Spirit of God-" And thus does the apostle explain a great 
mystery. How beautiful this explanation is, how simple, how direct — 
that the things of man are to be comprehended by the spirit of man, 
that the things of God are only discerned by the Spirit of God. 

NO SINGLE PRINCIPLE OF THE GOSPEL WILL INSURE SALVATION 

In the gospel there are many doctrines, all of which are neces- 
sary to a plan of salvation. If any one of the doctrines is separated 
from the others — for they are all closely connected and are to be 
taken as a guide — that doctrine will come short of insuring salvation, 
it will lose its power. Take for instance the principle of faith. It 
seems to be the moving principle of action in almost all things. The 
Apostle Paul says of it in Hebrews 11 : 

"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word 
of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do 
appear." * * * 

"By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land : which the 
Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 

"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about 
seven days. * * * 

"And what shall I more say?" the apostle observed,, "for the time would 
fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of 
David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: Who through faith subdued 
kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of 
lions, quenched the violence cf fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of 
weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies 
of the aliens." 

WORKS MUST ACCOMPANY FAITH 

You will see by this principle of faith that it is a doctrine of 
mighty power, but if it is separated from the gospel principles and taken 
as a single guide it will be lacking as a means of salvation- James said : 

"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith and I have works : shew me 
thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my 
works." 

Faith without works is dead, being alone. 

WHAT ARE SOME OF THESE WORKS? 

So it would seem that works must accompany this mighty principle 
of faith. What works are there which are related to it and essential 
to salvation? One of them is repentance. It is said that without faith 
it is impossible to please God, and I think we may say also that without 
repentance it would be impossible to please him. He is a holy being, 
and if we expect to come into his presence we must become like him.

John, the Baptist, cried repentance in the wilderness. Jesus preached 
the doctrine of repentance. It was the burden of his mission, and so 
it is the burden of our mission. 

REPENTANCE 

There is another very important principle that follows repentance, 
and involves the question of works. That principle is baptism. Peter, 
on the day of pentecost, warned the people regarding this important 
matter. They were pricked in their hearts. They wanted to know 
what to do. He said : "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the 
name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive 
the gift of the Holy Ghost." Thus it became necessary that the repentant 
believer should receive this vital ordinance of baptism. But the ordinance 
itself is not sufficient if administered with water only. Baptism is dual 
in its nature. It has fwo very important phases. This was brought out 
with great clearness by the Savior who, in conversation with Nicodemus, 
said : 

"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." 
And then further he said : 

"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter 
into the kingdom of God-" 

So that baptism represents a very important work and is closely 
associated with faith and repentance. 

BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST 

The other mighty companion principle that was emphasized by the 
Savior, and is so widely neglected in the world today, is the baptism of 
the Holy Ghost. How beautiful, how important, how imperative it is ! 
I fancy I hear somebody say: "Baptism of the Spirit? What does that 
mean? We have not been taught such a principle. It is not in our 
church ; we have not seen it in any of the other churches. What do you 
mean by baptism of the Spirit?" Well, Jesus said to his apostles, as 
he breathed upon them : "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." That was the 
baptism of the Spirit, which is sometimes referred to as baptism by fire 
and the Holy Ghost. When the aposles laid their hands upon converts 
and blessed them and said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," 
they did actually receive this divine Spirit, the Spirit of truth which 
was to be to them a special gift from heaven, to enable them to com- 
prehend the word of God, to discern things of a spiritual nature, to 
bring to their minds the remembrance of things past, things present, 
and to show them things to come- What did John, the apostle, say in 
respect to this matter? He said : (I John 5 :7-8.) 

"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the 
Word, and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one. 

"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and 
the water, and the blood : and these three agree in one."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THREE WITNESSES IN HEAVEN, THREE ON EARTH 

Three great and important witnesses in heaven and three upon the 
earth. This doctrine is put forth in a little greater clearness in the 
Pearl of Great Price, which shows that the ordinance of baptism is a 
profound doctrine of the gospel, and is essential to salvation. Let me 
read a few words to you, my brethren and sisters : 

"And the Lord spake unto Adam, saying: Inasmuch as thy children are 
conceived in sin, even so when they begin to grow up, sin conceiveth in their 
hearts, and they taste the bitter, that they may know to prize the good. 

"And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are 
agents unto themselves, and I have given unto you another law and commandment. 

"Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must 
repent." 

The doctrine of repentance is here greatly emphasized : 

"Or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing 
can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man 
of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, 
even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time. 

"Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely 
unto your children, saying : 

"That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, 
and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, 
which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born 
again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed 
by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified 
from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life 
in the world to come, even immortal glory." 

Thus these three witnesses are mentioned with emphasis — the 
Spirit and the water and the blood. 

"For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, 
and by the blood ye are sanctified ; 

"Therefore it is given to abide in you ; the record of heaven ; the Comforter ; 
the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which 
quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things ; that which knoweth all 
things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and 
judgment." 

FULL PLAN OF SALVATION REVEALED TO THE SAINTS 

Thus we have in the gospel of Jesus Christ these important doc- 
trines which, in connection with many other doctrines, constitute a 
complete and full plan of salvation ; and this plan has been delivered to 
the Latter-day Saints- We have rendered obedience to these saving 
principles, we have accepted them in our lives and have shown our faith 
by our works. 

The Lord bless you, my brethren. and sisters of the Church 
strengthen you in faith and prepare you for all things that may come to 
pass in the providences of the Lord, I humbly. pray, in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I think I may say without question that all men are or ought to 
be candidates for the blessing of eternal life and celestial glory, 
seeking to know what is necessary to be done in order to obtain 
this boon and blessing, and then doing all in their power to ac- 
complish that end. 

ETERNAL LIFE AND CELESTIAL GLORY 

The gospel teaches us what is the meaning of eternal life and celes- 
tial glory and how it may be obtained. My understanding of it is that in 
order to obtain eternal life and celestial glory, we must receive all the 
ordinances of the gospel, keep all the laws and commandments of God 
and be willing to consecrate to his service our lives, our time, our 
talents, and our substance, as far as may be required for the build- 
ing up of the Church and kingdom of God upon the earth, and the 
establishment of righteousness, looking to the salvation of the 
souls of men and women. 

HOW TO GET FAITH, THE MOVING CAUSE OF ACTION 

To meet this obligation we must have great faith, for faith is 
the moving Cause of all action. It is the first principle of revealed 
religion and the foundation of all righteousness. It is a gift from 
God. How are we then to obtain this blessing, for faith is indeed a 
blessing from God to those who enjoy it? We must try to live in 
his favor, and when we are living righteous lives, according to our 
conception of what is right, being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, 
virtuous, and conscientious, the Lord will help us to that blessing 
as to all other blessings, for all blessings cometh from God. The 
Savior said "to search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have 
eternal life, and they are they which testify of me." The scriptures of 
the Old and New Testament and also modern scripture, the Book 
of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price, all 
testify, not only of the Son, but of the Father and the gospel plan. 
We ought to search the scripture. I believe it is a great weakness 
of the membership of this Church that we do not search the scrip- 
tures more than we do, because I am sure if we would do so we 
would have more faith, and the requirements made upon us by the 
gospel would be easier for us to comply with. The Lord has said 
also to his servants that faith cometh by hearing the word, and so 
we preach and so the scriptures teach, "how beautiful are the. feet 
of them that bringeth glad tidings and publisheth peace." The as- 
sistance of the Lord and the gift of faith cometh from him, ,by the 
inspiration of his holy Spirit, to those who are thus seeking honestly 
for truth and light. We must have faith in order to meet the re- 
quirements of the gospel necessary for obtaining eternal life. So I 
speak as do my brethren, that the Latter-day Saints and all who 
hear may be led to an investigation, to the obtaining of faith, to the 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



engagirlg in good works, to the meeting of all of the requirements 
of the gospel that they may obtain that boon and blessing of eternal 
life and celestial glory. 

AN APPEAL PERTAINING TO FAITH AND RELIGION 

Now I desire, my brethren and sisters, to make an appeal to 
you, as the appeal is made to me, in regard to these matters, per- 
taining to our faith and religious life. The young people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have adopted as their 
slogan for the ensuing year : "We stand for an individual testimony 
of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith." The story 
that Joseph tells of his experience when he was a boy fourteen years 
of age appeals to different people in different ways. Some who 
are more credulous, perhaps, than others, and whose minds are not 
biased, who are not prejudiced by things which have been said 
against Joseph Smith, against this people and against this work, 
receive more readily the testimony of Jesus and evidences of the 
truth of this work. Others will not give a serious thought that 
they might understand these things. 

CONCERNING JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET 

I want to refer to something that appeals to me, and I think it 
should appeal to all of us concerning the story of the boy Joseph 
Smith. We are told in the scripture that know.n unto God are all 
things, even the end from the beginning; and also we are told that 
the Lord doeth nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants 
the prophets. The scriptures contain the things of God as he has 
revealed them to his prophets. The scriptures declare an apostasy 
to take place in the Church, and they also declare a restoration, when 
all things that have been spoken by the mouths of all the holy 
prophets since the world began would be restored. There could 
be no restoration had there not been an apostasy. Historians tell 
us very minutely of how an apostasy did take place. The thing 
that men and women of the world, religionists, ought to have been 
looking forward to is a restoration of the gospel, which was to be 
in the last days. It was to be a gospel dispensation of the fulness 
of times. 

In connection with these statements of the scripture, I have in 
mind what the Lord revealed to his servant Abraham. He showed 
unto Abraham certain intelligences, spirits of men, and told Abra- 
ham that they were some of his noble ones whom he had chosen to 
be his rulers, and said he : "Thou, Abraham, art one of them. Thou 
wast chosen before thou wast born." Now the kind of ruling that 
Abraham did is the kind of ruling the Lord had in mind, servants 
of the Lord and servants of the people, and it is most natural to my 
mind, that the Lord, looking forward to the establishment of his 
Church, and the restoration of the everlasting gospel in this the 
Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, in preparation for the second 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



89 



and glorious coming of our Lord, would reserve one of the greatest 
and noblest of these noble ones whom he showed to Abraham, to 
head his work, to be his mouthpiece, to be his prophet, to restore 
the gospel, to establish his Church, and to do all things, that are 
necessary in this the dispensation, at least in the starting of this 
great work. And it seems reasonable, too, my brethren and sisters, 
in the light of the scriptures that he should choose a boy fourteen 
years of age for this work, for we read in the scripture : "Ye see' 
your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, 
not many mighty, not many noble, are called ; but God hath chosen 
the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God 
hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things 
which are mighty, and base things of the world and things whic! 
are despised hath God chosen : yea, and things which are not, tc 
bring to naught the things that are. That no flesh shall glory 
in his presence." To me it seems most consistent, the time being 
ripe and the Lord desired to restore the gospel, that he should raisi 
up one of those noble spirits, take him in young boyhood, educate 
him and prepare him for the mighty work that he had to accom- 
plish. So I believe that the life's work of Joseph Smith will prove 
this to be true. The Lord did take him in hand, and from the time 
Joseph had his first vision of the Father and the Son, every step 
taken was in the narrow way, forward, and he never had to recede 
from a position he had taken or a principle he had taught. Besides, 
inasmuch as he had this mighty work to do of standing at the head 
of this dispensation, it was right and proper that he should have 
a correct conception of God the eternal Father and of his Son, 
Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, for the faith of all intelligent 
beings is centered in God. In order to have a perfect faith such 
as will lead one to endure all that is necessary for him to endure 
in this life, and especially when called to so high a calling, he 
must have a correct conception of God, and of his Son Jesus 
Christ. And this he could not obtain from the religious creeds ; 
for example, in the great Church of England of which my grand- 
parents on my mother's side and other ancestors for generations 
were members, and were brought up in that faith. The first article 
of that religion reads : 

"There is one living and true God, everlasting, without body, 
parts or passions ; of infinite wisdom, power and goodness, the 
Maker and Preserver of all things visible and invisible, and in the 
unity of this Godhead there are three personages of one sub- 
stance, power and eternity, the Father, the Son and the Holy 
Ghost." Three personages, one substance, nobody. What kind of 
a being would answer that description? That is the kind of ai 
God our parents and our grandparents were taught to believe in 
and to worship. It is a marvel, when Joseph Smith came forth 
with this story of his vision and the declaration that the Father 
and the Son were separate individuals, glorified, immortal beings, 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



and exalted, stating that they had appeared to him and had told 
him that these religionists had gone astray, and that he was going 
to restore his true gospel, that our parents accepted the story and believed 
in it? The scriptures are replete with evidence that God is as Joseph 
Smith declared that he appeared unto him. Not only that, but men who 
arc not tied down by the creeds of the world have been frank in their ad- 
missions and conclusions, endorsing the scripture, which is an endorse- 
ment of the declaration of Joseph Smith. For instance, here is Henry 
Ward Beecher, one of the greatest preachers that the world has known 
outside of the true Church of Christ. He said : 

"I am compelled to say that I must form an ideal of God through his 
Son Jesus Christ. Christ is indispensable to me. My nature needs 
to fashion the thought of God, though I know him to be a Spirit, 
into something that shall nearly or remotely represent that which 
I know. I hold before my eyes a glorious form, therefore; but 
after all the glory, whatever may be the nimbus and the effluence 
round about it, it is to me a glorified form of a glorified man; and 
I therefore fashion to myself out of the spirit that which has to me, 
as it were, a divine presence and a divine being; namely, a divine 
man." 

THANKFUL FOR THE HERITAGE THAT HAS COME TO US 

Are we not thankful for this heritage that has come to us, we 
who have been born in the Church and have been taught the doc- 
trine of the gospel of Deity, and without prejudice we have been 
able to receive the doctrines taught by Joseph Smith, for not only 
did he teach us of the personality of the Father and of the Sbn, but 
the Lord revealed to him also the personality of the Holy Ghost, the 
other personage of the Trinity, that personage whose spirit may 
dwell in our hearts if we are prepared to receive him, and thus we 
become the temples of God, which we should keep most holy. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S WORKS PROCLAIM HIM A PROPHET OF GOD 

Now I see my time is about gone ; therefore, I will bring my 
remarks to a close by saying this, that the works of Joseph Smith, 
including the restoration of the gospel, the establishment of the 
Church and kingdom of God, all in fulfilment of the predictions of 
the Prophet, and the correcting of false doctrines and teachings, 
in fact all his works declare him a prophet of God by the rule which 
the Savior laid down, that we should know them by their fruits, 
and also by the logic used by the Apostle Paul to the Romans, 
speaking of the Deity, even his eternal power and Godhead are 
understood by the things which he made. Joseph Smith by his 
accomplishments is known to be a prophet of God, and I do know 
hirn to be such, and this work to be the work of God. I bear this 
testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

FIFTY YEARS OF SERVICE 

There is nothing that I enjoy more, in the way of public gatherings, 
than the General Conferences of the Church. The present occasion 
has for me a special, personal interest, in that it marks a distinct epoch 
in my life. Fifty years ago this very month, at the General Conference 
in October, 1876, I was called upon my first mission, to preach and 
teach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I have been preaching 
and teaching it ever since, both by tongue and pen. 

THE CITY OF WILLIAM PENN 

My field of labor, during the fore part of that mission, was the 
state of Pennsylvania, and at the city of Philadelphia a World's Fair 
was in progress, similar to that which is now being held there. It was 
the Centennial Exposition. The United States was a hundred years 
old, and the city of its birth was celebrating the event in befitting style. 

It was about four o'clock on the morning of a bleak November day 
when I landed in the City of Brotherly Love. I had sat up all night 
on the train from Chicago, not having sense enough to hire a sleeping 
berth — nor dollars enough, either — and as a result I felt somewhat 
"rocky." I had no sooner alighted upon the platform than a dapper 
voung fellow stepped up to me and said : "Where would you like to 
go?" 

"To the North Pennsylvania Depot," was my reply — that being the 
point where I was to take a train for the northern part of the state. 
T had no desire to visit the Fair, not being in a sight-seeing mood, but 
only intent upon reaching my destination as soon as possible. 

"Jump into my hack," said the young fellow, with the air of the 
spider to the fly, "and I'll take you where you want to go." 

"How much will it cost?" I inquired. 

"Three dollars." 

"Three dollars for taking me from one depot to another!" 

"It's several miles from here," he explained. 

"Where is the street car?" 

"Oh, there's no street car running at this hour." 

At this juncture another fellow came forward, and with a look of 
"brotherly love" on his countenance repeated the question put to me 
by his "pal" : "Where did you say you would like to go ?" 

"To the North Pennsylvania Depot." 

"Better go with the young man," he philanthropically (or Phila- 
delphically) advised. 

Still I hesitated, and was then offered a two-thirds discount. 

But just at that moment I saw a policeman standing a few rods 
away, and remembering a word of counsel given me before leaving 
home, to the effect that I was not to trust every Tom, Dick and Harry 



02 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who might offer to serve me, but apply for information to someone in 
uniform, I pushed past the two fellows who were bent upon fleecing 
me, and approaching the officer inquired: 

"Where is the street car to the North Pennsylvania Depot?" 

"Right around the corner, sir," said he. And sure enough, there 
it was. T got aboard, paid one dime, and saved two dollars and ninety 
cents by remembering and acting upon that word of wise counsel. Such 
was my introduction to the City of William Penn. 

It is something of a coincidence, interesting to me if to no one 
else, that as I enter upon another half century of service — all of which 
I do not expect to spend in the United States, nor in any other place 
this side of the Spirit World — another great Exposition, the Sesqui- 
centennial, is in full blast at the famous old town. 

THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 

One hundred and fifty years ago, on July 4, 1776, the represen- 
tatives of the Thirteen United American colonies, which up to that 
time had acknowledged allegiance to Great Britain, met in Philadelphia 
for the purpose of declaring those colonies free and independent. They 
put forth the immortal document known and revered as the Declaration 
of Independence, the preface to the Constitution of the United States, 
which the Lord has declared in our day to have been established "by 
the hands of wise men" whom He "raised up unto this very purpose." 
The signers of the Declaration were fifty-six in number, and some of 
the sentiments to which they subscribed their names are as follow : 

"We hold these truths to be self-evident — that all men are created 
equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable 
rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that when- 
ever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is 
the right of people to alter or polish it, and to institute a new govern- 
ment, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers 
in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and 
happiness." 

"The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of 
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object, the estab- 
lishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this, let 
facts be submitted to a candid world." 

Then, after enumerating those acts of usurpation and tyranny, the 
Declaration closes thus: 

"We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of 
America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme 
Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name 
and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly 
publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of right ought 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all 
allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between 
them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. 
* * * And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance 
on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each 
other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." 

AN ACT OF HEROISM 

These men were not Latter-day Saints — but they deserved to be. 
They did not bear the Priesthood, nor did they have the fulness of the 
gospel, with the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost. They were not 
members of the Church of Christ— they had no opportunity to be, for 
it was not then upon the earth. Yet there was something within them 
that made them willing to imperil their lives, not for personal profit, 
not for self-aggrandizement, but for freedom and justice and the 
rights of man. 

Their act was heroic, thrilling. Even to read about it almost 
brings the tears to one's eyes. One of those men, after signing his 
name and laying down the pen, said: "Now we must hang together, or 
we shall all hang separately." And this was no exaggeration. Had 
they failed, they would have been executed as traitors and rebels. It 
was their success that saved them, and God gave them that success. 

JEFFERSON AND ROUSSEAU 

Thomas Jefferson was the author of the Declaration, though 
some of its phrases were current in that day — common property. Jef- 
ferson, heaven-inspired, breathed into them the breath of life and made 
them live forever. It was a glorious achievement. 

"All men are created equal." This phrase is Rousseau's — he whose 
pen kindled the fierce fires of the French Revolution. It does not 
mean, of course, that all men are equal in intelligence and capacity, any 
more than they are equal in stature or in weight. But all have equal 
rights to life, to liberty, to the pursuit of happiness, and are entitled 
to equal opportunities for possession and promotion. 

That is America's doctrine, and it is God's doctrine, too — yet to 
be emphasized when Zion's children, the pure-in-heart, become equal 
in temporal as in spiritual things, and are of one heart and mind, "every 
man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an 
eye single to the glory of God." 

AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN IDEALS 

"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the 
governed." That also is God's doctrine — the doctrine of common 
consent, exemplified at every Church, stake or ward conference, where 
the names of the presiding authorities are regularly placed before the 
people, to see whether they will sustain them as their leaders and 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



teachers. This they manifest by giving or withholding their consent. 

Compare this doctrine with the notion once prevalent in European 
as in Oriental countries, that the king or hereditary ruler of a nation 
was the owner of that nation, the proprietor not only of the land, but 
of the people living upon it. They all belonged to him and he might 
dispose of them as he saw fit, not being accountable to any human 
power for his actions. When a reigning princess married the monarch 
of another realm, all her dominions and all her subjects went with her 
as part of the bridal dowry. 

Such was the case when the Netherlands, largely Protestant in 
religion, passed into the possession of the Catholic king of Spain, who 
forthwith undertook to convert his new subjects by force, using for 
that purpose his pillaging and slaughtering armies. The Stuart kings 
governed England as if it were their personal property, and the contro- 
versy that arose brought forth a Hampden and a Cromwell, and cost 
King Charles the First his head. He had "lost his head" a little while 
before. The German Kaiser habitually referred to his people as "my 
Prussians," and even in democratic England the king, according to 
the custom of centuries, still speaks officially of "my armies," "my 
navies," "my government." 

A wonderful and startling change was wrought when men arose 
upon these Western shores who dared to say and maintain: We, the 
people, are the true sovereigns. We choose our rulers, and they are 
our servants, not our masters, and are accountable to us for the manner 
in which, they govern the commonwealth and administer the laws 
enacted by our representatives for the general welfare. 

LINCOLN AND JOSEPH SMITH 

That is the American idea, "government of the people, by the 
people, for the people," as Lincoln expressed it in his famous Gettys- 
burg speech. 

And nothing proves more conclusively that Joseph Smith, God's, 
prophet, was a real and true American, than his reply to one who in- 
quired of him how he managed to govern a people made up of so many 
different nationalities, with all their varied languages, customs and 
traditions. Said the Prophet: "I teach them correct principles, and 
they govern themselves." 

The United States is a Republic, in which the people are recognized 
as the one source of power. The Church of Christ is a Theo-Democ- 
racy, in which God speaks and the people say *' Amen." It is the 
Church of God and his people— the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

THE MISSION OF AMERICA 

Were I to say that the founders of this Nation builded better than 
they knew, few if any would question the statement. But if, in addition 
to that, I should voice my conviction that this great Government was 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



95 



established purposely to favor the coming forth of the Church of 
Christ in this dispensation — the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times — 
many would deem my declaration presumptuous and even preposterous. 
Great movements are generally so regarded in the beginning. 

It' was "presumptuous" in Columbus to pit himself against the 
learned ignorance of his age, and proclaim the earth round, when publir 
opinion held it to be square and flat or shaped like a cheese. But his 
"presumption" led to the discovery of the Western Hemisphere and the 
founding of the mightiest nation of modern times. It was "presumptu- 
ous" for the American colonies to declare their independence and array 
themselves against the militant might of the British Empire. But 
diey succeeded, and their "presumption" was swallowed up in victory, 
amid the thunders of the world's applause. In like manner it may look 
presumptuous for a little handful of people, numbering only half a 
million all told, to claim that a nation originally of three millions and 
now of one hundred and ten millions, was founded for the express 
purpose of furthering their God-given mission of preparing the way 
before Messiah's second advent. But when the Kingdom of Heaven pre- 
vails, and Christ is reigning in person over a glorified planet, such a 
claim will not be considered presumptuous, preposterous, nor at all 
out of the way. 

All great builders build better than they know. Some realize in 
part, but others not at all, that they are instruments of Deity, used for 
carving out his sublime and beneficent purposes. 

ALEXANDER THE GREAT 

Passing by the patriarchs, the prophets and the apostles of ancient 
times — all of whom helped to prepare the way for this last and greatest 
of the gospel dispensations ; and dismissing with a word such characters 
as Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus — the former referred to in sacred writ 
as the Lord's "servant," and the latter as his "anointed" — let us take 
as an example Alexander the Great. 

When I was a child I was taught to sum up this great man's career 
by saying: "He conquered the world, but could not conquer himself, 
and died a drunkard at the early age of thirty-two." But, I have since 
learned that Alexander did something more, which is not often referred 
to — I don't know why", since it is quite as important as a dissertation 
on the wine cup and the evils of intemperance. Alexander's conquests 
carried the Greek language as far as the borders of India, and that is 
the language into which the New Testament was afterwards translated. 
Thus the Macedonian conqueror paved the way, not consciously, but as 
an instrument of Providence, for the subsequent promulgation of the 
gospel. While building for himself an empire that was destined to 
perish with his passing, he helped to lay the foundations of the King- 
dom that shall stand forever. 

Dean Farrar, in his Life and Work of St. Paul, says : "The 



96 



( i E XERAL CONFERENCE 



immense field covered by the conquests of Alexander gave to the 
civilized world a unity of language, without which it would have been, 
humanly sneaking, impossible for the earliest preachers to have made 
known the good tidings in every land which they traversed." 

McCabe the historian dilates upon the same fact as follows: 
"Alexander was no vulgar conqueror, and his title of Great does not 
rest simply upon his conquests. * :;: :|: Wherever he went he left 
the Greek language and some portion of Greek culture, as a priceless 
legacy to the countries through which he passed. This universal spread 
of the Greek tongue was all powerful in drawing the nations of the old 
world into a closed and more intimate contact with one another. Greek 
became the language of commerce as well as of the court. At a later 
period the Hebrew Scriptures, translated into Greek, were made ac- 
cessible to the whole world, and the way was thus paved for the mission 
of him of whom these Scriptures testified," 

"God moves in a mysterious way, 
His wonders to perform." 

rome's unconscious service to christ 

Dean Farrar again: "The rise of the Roman Empire created a 
political unity which reflected in every direction the doctrines of the 
new faith. * * * The gospel emanated from the capital of Judea ; 
it was preached in the tongue of Athens; it was diffused through the 
empire of Rome; the feet of its earliest missionaries traversed the 
solid structure of undeviating roads by which the Roman legionaries — 
'those massive hammers of the whole earth' — had made straight in the 
desert a highway for our God. Semite and Aryan had been unconscious 
instruments in the hands of God for the spread of a religion which, in 
its first beginnings, both alike detested and despised." 

THE DIVINE PURPOSE 

In due time came Columbus, impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to 
cross the mighty waters surging between European and American 
shores. To what end? To prove the earth round, and reach India by 
sailing west? Yes, that was Ms motive. But the "Divinity that shapes 
our ends, rough hew them as we will," had a higher purpose in view, 
to which the comparatively small objective of the Genoese explorer 
was but tributary. 

The unveiling of a hidden hemisphere, the discovery of the Land of 
Zion, the predestined theatre of wonderful events in the last days, 
events connected with the winding up of the Lord's work upon this 
planet — the Land where the New Jerusalem is to rise, unto which 
Christ will come as King of kings, to usher in the reign of peace and 
right. This was God's purpose, accomplished through Columbus. 

The lovers of liberty who followed in his wake and were actuated 
by the same Spirit, as a further preparation for the great Latter-day 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



97 



Development founded upon this North American continent a nation, 
the mightiest on earth, under whose protecting aegis, the constitutional 
guarantee of religious freedom, the Church of God came forth, to be 
nurtured unto the complete fulfilment of its destiny. 

ISRAEL AND THE GENTILES 

Did the American patriots who framed and signed the Declaration, 
who established the Constitution and laid the foundations of this mighty 
commonwealth, realize that they were bringing to pass the prediction's 
of American prophets and the words of Jesus Christ concerning the 
Gentiles upon this land ? No ; for the record of those divine utterances 
was yet slumbering in the earth, awaiting the set time for coming 
forth. Nor do the Gentile nations of today realize that with then- 
ships and railroads and other means of transportation and communica- 
tion, they are helping to gather scattered Israel in fulfilment of ancient 
prophecy : "They shall fly upon the shoulders of the Phillistines toward 
the West." 

THE GLORIOUS FUTURE 

Columbus built better than he knew. Wyclif fe, Luther, the reform- 
ers, explorers and conquerors all, as well as the founders of this Nation, 
did likewise. And even the Latter-day Saints, with all their knowledge 
of divine plans and purposes, revealed from heaven, to enable them to 
execute another phase of God's "marvelous work and wonder," have 
no adequate conception of its future greatness and glory. 

Nor is it necessary that we should have, at this time. Well for us 
if we diligently discharge the duty of the present hour, and patiently 
bide the time of Him whose omnipotent and unerring hand is guiding 
the Cause of Christ to its glorious consummation. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you in this con- 
ference of the Church, and to be associated again with , my brethren 
and sisters, and with my family, after our absence for nearly a year 
in South America. To me this has been indeed a wonderful conference 
gathering. I have been very much interested, and my faith and 
testimony have been strengthened in the instructions and teachings 
that have come to us from those who have spoken. 

I have been led to reflect that we are indeed a distinctive and a 
wonderful people, and that there is nothing like our organization and 
our institution anywhere else in all the world, so far as I have been 
able to come in contact with things in the world. 

Our trip into South America brought to my attention many, many 
things that were new to me. It seemed that we were in another world, 
and I observed the practices and the customs of the peoples of the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



countries where we went with a desire to learn and to see things from 
their viewpoint. We came in contact with people who believed dif- 
ferently religiously. I will say in regard to them that I encountered 
a sincerity that is very commendable, upon their part, in the faith that 
they have in God, as they understand him, and in their religion, or 
their gospel, as it is taught to them, and as they have believed in it, 
and their fathers before them for many years. But I will say that 
after this review I came back with the conviction stronger than ever 
in my mind that we are a people apart from the world, and although I 
have seen much that is good and much that is commendable in 
the religions and in the practices of the people of the world, I had in my 
heart a spirit of thankfulness which I cannot express, that my lot has 
been cast with a people who know that we have the truth of the ever- 
lasting gospel restored to us, that there is no uncertainty in our minds, 
that we can go forward with confidence and work out our salvation 
in our Father's kingdom, knowing that we are on the right track. 

It has been to me a source of joy, my brethren and sisters, to 
bear my testimony of the restoration of the gospel to the people of 
South America. As I listened to Elder Ballard's report of our trip, my 
mind was led to reflect upon the saying of the Savior, wherein he said : 
"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not." 1 
have had joy that is unspeakable in associating with little children in 
these foreign nations, and my heart has gone out to them. We asked 
them if they belonged to any church and invariably they say : "Yes." 
I have asked them, "What do you believe? What are your teachings? 
Do you pray?" And brethren and sisters, that which is commonplace 
with our children, taught to us from infancy, is lacking in the lives of 
these other children. I wish that each one here could see the faces 
of those little foreign children light up when we carry over to them 
the things that seem most common to us. When we taught them 
how to pray, when we taught them how to sing, when we rehearsed 
to them the stories of the Savior, and the great love he had for mankind, 
and the great works that he did among the children of men, we found 
their eyes wide open and their mouths agape, light in their countenances 
and joy manifesting itself from the depths of their souls, for the truths 
we were able to teach them. And they have said : "We have never 
known these things." It is remarkable to have the opportunity of 
carrying them to our Father's children who have been left in spiritual 
darkness through the systems in which they believe. Then, too, the 
children are not all small as pertaining to the affairs of the kingdom 
of our Father in heaven. The adults are children. W,e find them as 
such, and it has been a joy to me, my brethren and sisters, to be able to 
assist in teaching these adult children of our Father in heaven the 
truths they confess to us have brought the greatest joy that they have 
felt in their lives. I recall the people that Elder Ballard referred to 
yesterday, when they first came to our gathering, two Italian men 
came first, out of curiosity, I think. They had been in the United 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



99 



States a little while, many years ago, and they learned that we Americans 
were holding services in their vicinity. They came to our meetings, 
but they knew nothing about our religion. They knew nothing about 
the Bible- They wished to get the scriptures, and we obtained them foi 
these men. After attending our meetings for some time, and hearing 
us try to teach the children to pray in Sunday school, one of the men 
came to me and said : "Can you get me a prayer book, so that I can 
pray, too?" I explained to him, as best I could, that we do not pray 
out of books, but just like a child would ask its father for what it 
wants, we ask our heavenly Father for the things that we alone 
know that we need. "Well," he said, "I have been a member of a 
church all my life, but I have never been taught to pray that way. I 
must confess to you that I don't know how to begin. Won't you men 
do me the favor to come to my house some night when I am home 
from work and teach me and my family how to pray ?" It was one of 
the greatest opportunities that has ever come to me in my life, my 
brethren and sisters. I went with him, and we knelt around his family 
altar, s with his wife and children and with the other man whose family 
was left back in Italy, and who is struggling hard to get means to bring 
them over there. We were able to teach them how to pray, how to 
ask a blessing upon the food, and to thank God for those commonplace 
blessings that we always thank him for, and think very little about tht! 
great blessing that we have in knowing how to do those things. 

I wish you could see how that man's faith grew. I wish that you 
could realize and visualize as we did, who were there, how things seemed 
to open up and unfold to him and his companions in that home. Before 
we left there, he said : "I am willing to forsake all you say is wrong, 
for I have an evidence and a testimony that has come to me that you 
have brought the truth into this land of South America." 

"Well," I said, "prepare yourself, quit your tobacco, and do a 
number of other things, and when the proper time comes these elders 
that are left here will admit you into the Church of Jesus Christ oi 
Latter-day Saints, through the door of baptism." Just before leaving 
El Paso I had a letter from Elder Sharp, who labored with me in 
Mjexico City, and who is now in South America, stating that those two 
men, a boy fourteen years of age, and the wife of one of the men, had 
come into the Church through baptism, and he said to me : "Brothei 
Pratt, I never have seen so much joy shine in the faces of men and 
women in all the wide world as there is in the lives of those people 
since they have joined the Church. This dear brother said to me: 
'I would rather lose all I have, and give my life, than to lose faith in the 
gospel that has been brought to us in this land by you missionaries'.' 
"Suffer little children to come unto me," the Savior said, and we as a 
people who have his authority have a very great responsibility, and an 
obligation to carry to the many millions of our Father's children in 
the world the tidings of which they are ignorant. 

I agree with Brother Ballard that my conception of our Father's 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



children has been enhanced and widened, in my contact with Latin 
people. I was prejudiced against them in a degree. My contact with 
them, in association with the Lamanite people in Mexico, made me so. 
They were the conquerors of the people. They had brought them down 
to where they are. I confess that I had a prejudice against them, but 
that prejudice has all been removed, and I feel happy that I can include 
them among our Father's children who are heirs to salvation, through 
the gospel that he has restored through Joseph Smith. And as our last 
speaker said, I am willing to agree that even the conquest of Mexico 
and the conquest of Guatemala and Central America and Peru, and the 
rest of South America, at the hands of those ruthless Spaniards who 
brought so much misery, and who have brought so much suffering in 
the wake of that conquest might, after all, be overruled for good, for 
at least it has prepared a way through which we can reach those people 
by having given to them a common language, the Spanish language, 
where before innumerable tribal languages existed that would have been 
almost ■ impossible for us to acquire in order to preach the gospel 
to those people. I am grateful to the Lord for the participation that 
I have had in opening up this new mission. I am desirous to continue 
to serve in any capacity where I may be called to labor. 

I leave with you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I know 
that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ, and I know, as well 
as I know anything in all this wide world, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of God, and that he was raised up to restore and to establish this 
great gospel in this day, age and dispensation in which we live, I know 
that if I live faithful and true to the teachings of this gospel, I will 
work out for myself a salvation and an exaltation in the celestial king- 
dom of our Father in heaven. I know that this is true for you and 
for my family, and for me, and for all whom I love. I know that if 
it is preached to the people of the world who know it not, and they 
accept it, it will result in the same to them, for this gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation unto all who believe it ; and those who believe it 
will obey it. The Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and help 
us all to serve him to the end, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

After the meeting this morning I was informed that hardly any 
of the audience heard what Brother Widtsoe said. Yesterday we had 
a very large machine here to emphasize what we were saying, and the 
one we have today lis not so good, so ,far as the sound is concerned. 
It was suggested that if I move this machine in front of me you 
could hear much better. Did my voice sound louder the last minute? 
(Answer from voices in the audience: Yes, yes.) 

We will ask the speakers to face the machine and maybe that will 
help. Somebody sent word that they were not hearing Brother Claw- 
son. He then raised his voice and we all heard him, so I understand. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 101 



The choir and congregation sang, "O say what is truth ?" 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder George E. Browning, of 
the Weber stake. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AETERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

Promptly at 2 o'clock the opening hymn was announced, and the 
congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder William F. Webster, of the Wayne 
stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the 
day of salvation." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I very much desire that the few moments I occupy may be profitable 
to you, and to that end I ask an interest in your faith and prayers, that 
my mind may be touched by the power of the Lord to say those things 
that he would have you hear. 

We have had much in the way of instruction. Many delightful 
discourses have been delivered here. We have been edified under the 
influence of the Spirit of the Lord. I feel grateful to be here. I 
rejoice with you that we are permitted to meet under such favorable 
conditions and to enjoy those things which our heavenly Father would 
have us hear. 

GREAT PRIVILEGES ENJOYED 

Today throughout the world there are millions of our Father's 
children who would give all they possess if they could be present to 
hear the instructions that we have received here. There are millions 
who have no conception of the purposes of our heavenly Father in 
placing them here upon the earth, yet we have been so favored that we 
not only have the instructions that were given to ancient Israel, but 
we have information that was given to us in this latter day in addition. 
There is no doubt in the mind of a Latter-day Saint who has received a 
testimony of the divinity of the mission of Christ our Lord. That is 
fundamental to us in building our hope for eternal life. We believe in 
God the Eternal Father and we believe that Jesus Christ was the 
manifestation of God in the flesh, his Only Begotten Son; and we 
believe in the Holy Ghost and the power that it manifests unto those 
who seek to do the will of our Father in heaven. This belief is funda- 
mental with us, and it leaves us in the position of children of God. 
We are the children of our heavenly Father. He is the Father of our 
spirits.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OUR PRE-EXISTENCE 

We lived before we came here and our birth into this world was 
the reward of having kept our first estate. When we were born we 
received a physical tabernacle without which we could not be exalted in 
the presence of our heavenly Father. It was necessary for his Son Jesus 
Christ to be born into the world in order that he, too, might have a 
tabernacle like unto the one that his Father has. We dwell here upon 
this earth realizing that we are indeed the children of God, knowing 
that he prepared this earth particularly for those who dwell upon it, 
that he has placed upon it those things that are necessary to sustain 
life and make all men and women happy, as far as the creature comforts 
of life are concerned. We should take advantage of the opportunities 
he has given us so abundantly. 

PURPOSE OF OUR EARTH LIFE 

We are placed here and instruction has been given us. We are 
informed that we will not be held responsible for the sin of Adam, but 
that we will be held responsible for our own sins. The atonement of 
Jesus Christ removed from us the responsibility of atoning for the 
sin of father Adam, and he has made it possible for us to live here 
upon the earth, and in due time, if we take advantage of our oppor- 
tunities, we will be prepared to be resurrected from the dead when that 
time shall come. There is no doubt in the mind of a Latter-day Saint 
as to the purpose of our earth life. We are here to prepare ourselves 
and develop ourselves and qualify ourselves to be worthy to dwell in 
the presence of our heavenly Father. We must learn to overcome our 
passions, our evil tendencies. We must learn to resist temptations- That 
is why we are here, and in order that we may more perfectly do that 
the gospel has been restored to the earth, and we have been made par- 
takers of it, and we have the strength that comes to us as a result of the 
power of the Holy Ghost. We not only have the resistance of an 
ordinary individual, with the limitations that such an individual has 
who has not a knowledge of the truth — we have equal resistance with 
him, and in addition the resistance which comes from knowing the 
truth and knowing the purpose of our being. 

SCRIPTURE STUDY IMPORTANT 

Now how important it is, with that understanding, that we 
phould study the scriptures, that we should search the word of the Lord. 
The Savior said, "Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye 
have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me." With that 
understanding we are not left as the world, but we have been warned 
by the Redeemer of mankind and we have been told just what we 
must do. We must have faith in God, we must repent of our sins, 
because while we are in a sinful condition we are in no way prepared 
to enter into the celestial kingdom, and we are informed that if we 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



103 



cannot keep the celestial law we cannot abide a celestial glory. The 
gospel has been restored in these latter days to prepare- men for the 
celestial kingdom. This gospel has not- been given to qualify men for 
any other kingdom, but has been given to us to prepare us that we 
may dwell upon this earth when it has been celestialized, when our 
Redeemer will dwell here and he will be our lawgiver and our king. 

CARE TO BE EXERCISED IN EVERY-DAY LIVING 

Knowing these truths, how careful we as Latter-day Saints ought to 
be to live every day of our lives that we may be influenced by the power 
of the Lord, and that we may be able to turn aside from those things 
that have a tendency to break down our power to earn the celestial 
kingdom. The fact that we have been baptized into the Church is not 
sufficient. The fact that our names are on the Church records is 
not sufficient. The Redeemer himself has said that "not every one that 
sayeth unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, 
but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." That is 
well defined, therefore we cannot drink with the drunken, we cannot 
debauch our lives, we cannot be dishonorable in our dealings with our 
fellowmen and gain celestial glory. We must keep the commandments 
of our heavenly Father. We are told in other scripture that those 
who do not keep the commandments of God will forfeit their right 
to the blessings of the celestial kingdom. If we had been left to 
speculate on these matters, if we had been left without suitable infor- 
mation to prepare us for this life and to make preparations for the life 
to come, perhaps we might be indifferent and excuse ourselves as the 
world does. They do not understand, but for those who have been made 
partakers of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days there is 
no excuse if we are not living a righteous life. We have been fully 
taught, we have observed the effects of righteousness upon the lives of 
others. We have had the assurance that by living the commandments 
of God happiness will be our portion here, and that this will be the 
foundation upon which we will build for eternal happiness. 

DUTIES OF TEACHERS IN THE CHURCH 

Throughout the stakes and wards of this great Church there are 
men whose duty it is to teach these principles. We send into the world 
missionaries by thousands to proclaim this gospel. There is no charge 
made for this service, it is offered to the world, to the whole human 
family without money and without price. It is so important that people 
shall understand this gospel that our heavenly Father sent his Only 
Begotten Son into the world to teach it, and he died that we might live, 
that we might be resurrected from the dead. And in order that there 
might be a well defined pathway to the celestial kingdom he organized his 
Church and set in it the officers that were necessary — apostles, prophets, 
pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc. These were the officers that were 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to be maintained in the Church. One of his disciples is recorded 
as having said that these are to remain in the Church until all shall 
come to a unity of the faith. Why is it necessary that we come to 
a unity of the faith? It is because there is only one true faith, there 
is only one true gospel, and if we partake of some other gospel, if we 
devote our lives to work for some other god, then has the adversary 
taken advantage of his opportunities and destroyed for us the benefits 
that our heavenly Father intended that we should have. So the gospel 
was restored, and we are informed what we are required to do. Not 
only must we be identified with this Church by faith, repentance, bap- 
tism, and the laying on of hands, for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but we 
must live every day of our lives in such a way that we will be earning 
the reward of celestial glory. The man who violates the Sabbath day 
loses the Spirit of the Lord, and forfeits this companionship. The man 
who violates the rules and regulations that govern the Church forfeits 
that sweet influence that would lead him eventually into the presence 
of our heavenly Father. Knowing that, how careful we ought to be to 
teach our boys and girls, and to teach our neighbors the things that 
God has intended that they should know. And not only teach by word 
of mouth but exemplify our teachings in the lives that we lead. 

MESSAGE OF THE CHURCH MUST BE PROCLAIMED TO ALL 

There is a wonderful group of men and women in this Church, 
each one of whom has come out of the world, or has been born to 
those who have come out of the world. It is not a popular thing to 
be identified with this Church, but in various parts of this earth, in 
various nations of the earth, where the gospel has been taught, it has 
been preached by men possessing the same authority as that possessed by 
the disciples of old, men who had the right to declare in the name of the 
Lord that this is the latter day, that our heavenly Father is preparing 
for the second coming of his Son Jesus Christ. That message must 
be proclaimed in all the world before the end comes, and that duty- 
has been laid upon the membership of this Church, and to that end, 
in order that men might do it properly and under proper direction, 
the authority of the Holy priesthood has been conferred. Men have 
been ordained and set apart to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
they leave their homes and their loved ones and they travel for years 
among the children of men and divide with them that glorious truth 
that leads to eternal life in the celestial kingdom of our heavenly Father. 

A GREAT OBLIGATION IS OURS 

What manner of men ought we to be in the darkness that sur- 
rounds this earth, in the uncertainty that exists everywhere, as to why 
we live and where we are going? Our heavenly Father has taught 
this gospel to us in great plainness in this day, and we are told by 
one who lived centuries ago, and it is recorded in the scriptures, that 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



105 



"a wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein." We have that 
information that they possessed, and in this latter day there have been 
added to it the testimony of the Book of Mormon, the testimony of 
Joseph Smith and the revelations that the Lord gave to him, supplement- 
ing the things that we already possessed, adding to the information that 
God had given to the children of men, to the end that we might be pre- 
pared when our Redeemer shall come to dwell here upon this earth. 

Therefore, my brethren and sisters, a great obligation rests upon 
us. We have received this knowledge and we may possess it only ou 
condition that we keep the commandments of God. A man may know 
as he knows that he lives that Jesus is the Christ. He may know that 
this is the gospel which is the power of God unto salvation ; but if he 
transgresses the laws of God, if he becomes evil in his life, his mind 
may become darkened and he may turn away from that faith that points 
directly to the celestial kingdom, and spend his time along by-ways that 
will only lead him eventually into sorrow and distress, and that will 
mean that he has failed of his opportunities. 

THE GREAT NEED OF FAITH AND GOOD WORKS 

With that obligation resting upon us, what a wonderful thing it 
is that we are able to declare that we know the truth. It is not that 
we reason it out by the power of intellect alone- A man of his own 
thinking cannot find out God. We must keep the commandments of 
the Lord, we must follow the teachings of our heavenly Father, we 
must Jive in such a way that the whispering of that still, small voice will 
come to us and will indicate to us the truth. 

Today as I realize the need of faith, when I think of the 
multitude of our Father's sons and daughters who are in dark- 
ness, I realize that each of us ought to be putting forth every 
possible effort to carry this message forward if possible here at home 
and abroad. To that end we have been given divine authority, so that 
when an elder of this Church goes into the world he does not go to 
be instructed of those who have been educated in the seminaries of 
learning necessarily, but he goes with the information he may possess. 
He may have a trained mind, he may possess the learning that he has 
obtained in our great universities, but the thing that he possesses that 
is important to the world when he goes out to teach is a knowledge that 
God lives, a testimony of the divine mission of Jesus Christ; and to 
that end we have been called and chosen and set apart. And as a 
result of that wonderful gift from our Father in heaven, he expects 
us not only to say to others : Keep the commandments of the Lord, but 
he expects us to keep all of his commandments and live according to the 
laws that he has given to govern his Church. For that purpose we 
are called together upon the Sabbath day, in our quarterly conferences, 
and our general conferences. All these meetings are intended to keep 
us in touch with that intelligent Spirit that will interpret for us the 
things that are necessary for us to know. 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OUR DUTY TO RAISE A WARNING VOICE 

Now today, assembled as we are, if we were like all other de- 
nominations, we might seek the Lord and receive his blessings, because 
every man that does good in the world receives a blessing; we might 
have all the cardinal virtues and make them our own, but without the 
power of God and the authority of the holy Priesthood it is not possible 
for men to attain to the celestial kingdom. And, knowing that, how 
gladly we ought to give of our time and our means and of the power 
that the Lord has bestowed upon us to raise not only a warning voice, 
but a teaching voice, a voice of love, a voice of kindness, a voice of 
instruction to the children of men, and deliver our message in such 
a way that they will be constrained to listen, and that they will be 
anxious to know whereof we speak. Our heavenly Father has made it 
possible for all normal people in this world to know the truth if they 
will. He has made it possible for every man and every woman to 
receive the gospel if they will. We have our agency. Herein is the 
condemnation of man, because that which is the truth has been plainly 
manifested from the beginning. Knowing the truth how anxious we 
should be to disseminate that truth, how gladly we should give of the 
powers that we possess to do the good that our heavenly Father would 
have us do. We strive for the things of this earth that perish and 
by and by we leave those things behind, but if there has been burned 
into our souls a desire to serve God and keep his commandments by 
living our religion and teaching it to his children, then we are laying 
up for ourselves eternal riches of which no one can rob us. 

This testimony has come to me. I know that God lives. I know 
that Jesus is the Christ, and I know that this is the latter day. He 
loved the world, he restored the gospel and he sent divine personages 
here upon this earth to renew the gospel and confer the divine authority 
that was necessary in order that the mission that we had given to us 
here in the world might be rounded out and properly fulfilled. 

OUR SERVICE SHOULD BE FAITHFUL 

Now, brethren and sisters, these are the facts. This is our mission, 
this is our opportunity, and the Lord has promised us in return for 
availing ourselves of this opportunity that we shall have eternal life 
in the celestial kingdom, honor and glory throughout the ages of 
eternity. When we go to our various homes how anxious we should 
be that our houses be in order ; how pleased we should be to lead our 
families along the pathway to eternal life ; how grateful we should be 
to the Lord that he has given us this information, and as a result of it 
we ought surely to be an example to all the world. I pray that that 
Spirit which will enable us to serve faithfully may be with us, that 
that desire to do good may overcome the temptations that are placed 
in our way, and that, wherever we go, others observing our good works 
may be constrained to glorify our Father who is in heaven. This is 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



our Father's work. It is not a militant work, but it is a work of love, 
and with the help of our heavenly Father let us make it what he intends 
it should be— the glory of the earth and the means, for that is what it 
is, for the salvation of millions of his children who have not yet heard 
it, by reason of the faithfulness of our lives. 

That peace may abide in our hearts, that the testimonies that we 
have already received may remain with -us and be added to by reason 
of righteous lives, and that in the end, when we have finished our 
mortal lives, we may be found worthy to receive the reward of a 
permanent home in the celestial kingdom of our heavenly Father, in 
company with those we love, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that the Spirit of the Lord may 
direct what I may say this afternoon. There have been so many good 
things pass through my mind while the conference has been in progress, 
that it almost seems, at this present moment, that everything I ever 
thought of has been in the past. 

I am very grateful for the testimony that has come to me through 
my experience in the work of the Lord, that it really is his work and 
that it is not a work of man, nor any set of men, but that it is a won- 
derful work established in the earth for the bringing about of the 
Lord's purposes concerning" his children upon the earth. 

REALITY OF THE MISSION OF JOSEPH SMITH 

I have met a few people who have not yet a full understanding oi 
the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. They declare that it seems 
to be a myth or something that they cannot comprehend, something 
that does not seem a reality. But to me, ever since I was a small 
child and had the privilege of hearing the testimony of my parents and 
the teachers of the Church, the mission and life's work of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith have been wonderful realities. I picture certain import- 
ant instances in the life of the prophet which seem to be more impres- 
sive than other instances. For example, the occasion of his annual 
visits to the Hill Cumorah, and in fact the first vision of the Angel 
Moroni. Up to that time all of the artists and the scientists and the 
teachers of the world pictured to us that an angel was either a woman 
or a child. But here a man appears declaring himself to be an angel 
of the Lord, and coming directly from the presence of the Lord in 
answer to this boy's prayer. Joseph said that he was frightened at 
first. Well, I think most of us would be just a little frightened. 1 
fear that I would be more so than I am now. This angel declarec 
that he was a man who once lived upon this earth, and that he ha<, 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



come with a glorious message to declare to this young man, who had 
desired to know the truth. In all the anxiety of his heart and the 
earnestness of it, he had gone to his parents and friends and to the 
ministers, who were teaching religion so-called, and he had not found 
satisfaction. He did not find that which satisfied his heart, until 
finally he went to the Lord and received a satisfaction that was won- 
derful beyond our power at times to appreciate. For the Lord, our 
Father, and his Son Jesus Christ descended from heaven to answer 
the boy's question concerning his desire for the truth, and this was 
a reality, not a fancy or a dream. 

Many people desired and attempted to destroy that testimony and 
that conviction which came to that boy's heart. But he said that he 
knew that God knew that he had seen it, therefore, he could not deny 
it, it was to him a reality. It was a part of his life and he could not 
change it and be honest with himself nor with the Lord. In the great 
anxieties that followed the years in his great mission, to fulfill the 
great destiny of his life, he was visited upon many occasions by other 
heavenly messengers, and they, too, were a reality and not just myths, 
or dreams, or fancies. 

REALITY OF THE BOOK OF MORMON 

After this angel, called Moroni, had explained to the boy during 
that whole night many important things pertaining to his mission, he 
showed him the Hill Cumorah, in which were deposited the plates from 
which was translated the Book of Mormon. This reality was of such 
a character that the next morning, or perhaps about noon time, this 
young man went to the place called the Hill Cumorah, because he had 
seen it in vision the night before and that early morning with such 
completeness and such plainness that he went directly to the place 
which was shown him in the vision, and where the plates were depos- 
ited. And with some kind of an instrument cleared away the re- 
maining earth that covered the stone which covered the box; and, 
after he had removed the covering of the stone box which con- 
tained the records, like any curious youth or man, he reached for- 
ward in an attempt to take from the sacred box its contents, when, to his 
astonishment, he heard a voice forbidding him, and telling him that the 
time had not yet arrived for him to take these sacred treasures, and 
that he must further prepare himself by a course of waiting and prep- 
aration until such time as he might prove himself worthy of this great 
responsibility. 

This incident brings to me a feeling of the greatest reality. An 
angel we sometimes think of as being mystical, visionary and difficult 
to understand in appearance. But this was a reality, a person who 
could give instructions and talk as one man talks to another. 

And other instances of this character have so impressed me with 
the reality of the mission and instruction of the Prophet Joseph Smith 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



109 



that it is today a part of my very being. I believe it with all my heart, 
and the instructions and the great mission that have come through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith to the children of men in these the latter days 
are to me one of the greatest realities that come to us, and I believe in 
them with all my heart. 

TESTIMONY OF THE KINDNESS AND REALITY OF GOD. 

The principles of the everlasting gospel which have been pro- 
claimed to us during this conference until the Latter-day Saints have 
been very well instructed pertaining thereto ; and the faith and de- 
votion of men and women who are earnestly and sincerely striving 
to carry out those instructions and so to live that they may en- 
joy the blessings which the Lord has prepared for them — to me these 
are a wonderful testimony and reality of the kindness and mercy of 
the Lord. I am very grateful for the association that I have enjoyed 
laboring with the servants of the Lord, going about from stake to 
stake, from ward to ward, and conference to conference, doing what 
little I have been able to do to keep the work going and to encourage 
others to go on with it. 

THE REALITY OF THE WORK OF THE PATRIARCHS. 

I was very much impressed yesterday morning, and in fact during 
the whole day's services yesterday, when the house was packed to over- 
flowing, men and women standing in the doorways and in the aisles. 
I do not know just how many were present, but I made this compari- 
son : In just the few brief years that I have been sustained by the people 
as one of the general authorities, I have been instrumental in the 
hands of the Lord in administering blessings of the Lord to more 
people than were in the tabernacle yesterday morning. Of course 
that was not all at one time because that would be like speaking to 
them all at once. But during the years that have passed, since the 
conferences and the Church have sustained me as one of the general 
officers, 16,006 people have had blessings recorded in my office. 
That gives you just an idea of the reality of this work. Throughout 
the stakes of the Church men have been called to assist in this im- 
portant work, and I desire to bear further testimony relative to the 
responsibility that has come to these men as well as the responsibility 
that has come to me, for their commission is of the Lord just the 
same as mine. Their commission is a reality and it is of the Lord, 
just the same as the commission that has come to these other brethren. 
In their calling it is just as important as my calling is to me in my 
place, because "it is the work of God, it is not the work of man. Their 
commission is through the priesthood of God, and it is just as import- 
ant in their place as my work is in my place, and I would like to en- 
courage the Latter-day Saints to give greater honor to the men who 
bear the Priesthood at home. I do not want to discredit anything 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that I might do, because I have a testimony that my work is important. 
I did not always have that testimony. There was a time when I doubt- 
ed it, but the Lord in his kindness has banked up testimony after 
testimony around me until I believe I can almost sympathize with 
the great Patriarch Job, because he was banked up all around with 
blessings and with testimonies. I hope I shall not have to endure what 
he passed through in order to prove the realities of those testimonies. 
I am perfectly satisfied with them as they are, and I hope they shall 
be strengthened through my further devotion to the work. 

PRIESTHOOD SHOULD BE HONORED. 

I should like to encourage all men who bear the Priesthood to 
honor it because it is of God ; it is a reality and a power that is not 
given without a purpose to men. I have faith that the Priesthood 
of God has been given to men for service, to act in the name of the 
Lord to do his work ; and when they fail to serve they fail to get his 
blessing. So, I desire that the members of the Church will honor 
those men who are given this important office in the stakes of Zion, 
as well as honoring all other men who bear the Priesthood, from the 
president of the Church down to the least and last officer, because I 
am satisfied, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this is the work of 
God. and that these men who sit before me and those who sit upon 
the stand today, who are called to be officers and leaders in the Church, 
are men endowed by a power that is not found anvwhere else in the 
world, because it is the power of God that has come to men through 
the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith and those who have 
succeeded him. 

A PRAYER TO BLESS THE CHURCH AND ITS MEMBERS 

I am very grateful that only in a few short stens I sm able to 
trace back, throusrh the lives of those who have received this Priesthood, 
that power which has been given to me. I was ordained to the Dower 
T hold todav by the president of the Church, the prophet Toseph 
F. Smith. He was ordained by the president of the Church, Brigham 
Young. President Young was ordained bv Oliver Cowdery, who was 
ordained by the Prophet, who was ordained bv Peter. James and John 
and they were ordained by the Savior himself. And so within a very 
few, short steps I am satisfied, beyond the shadow of doubt, that the 
Priesthood of God is given to men to function for the Lord, and that 
his holy purposes may be accomplished. In humility, with the faith 
that these realities have developed in me. and with eratitude for the 
testimonies I enioy, I pray the Lord to bless the Church, all of its 
officers, all of its members, and all of those who are taking part 
in this great work, from the greatest to the least. I pray that peace 
and the testimony of this truth may burn within your hearts, that the 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



111 



conviction of its worth and honor may help you to live so that you 
may obtain the glorious blessings that have been predicted and pro- 
nounced upon you through your faithfulness. I bless you all, my 
brethren and sisters, that the enjoyment of the truth may be your por- 
tion; and that, through your faithfulness, you may overcome every 
barrier that may come in your pathway to serve the Lord and to keep his 
commandments ; and that you may triumph in your efforts to bring 
about the holy purposes of God. I pray that these blessings may 
be upon all the officers and members of the Church, whether they 
be gathered or scattered. I pray that the time will soon arrive when 
the Lord will come and accept the work that is being done by this 
faithful people, and that they may grow and increase in faith and in 
principle, until they shall accomplish his work, and we shall enjoy the 
blessings which the Lord has prepared for us as his faithful children. 
I pray for these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo, "Come unto me," was sung by Mrs. June Marley. 
ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and purple robe, and 
Filate saith unto them, Behold the man !" 

THE WORLD NEEDS MEN 

My brethren and sisters, when Pontius Pilate used these words, 
he directed attention to a perfect man. The world needs men, 
men of character, God-fearing men. "The world needs men, true' 
men who cannot be bought or sold, men who will scorn to violate 
truth, genuine gold." 

What is the end and purpose of religion, "swaying the lives 
of men the centuries through?" The Latter-day Saints answer in 
the words of the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph, that 
the end and purpose of true religion,, which is the work of God, 
is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." 

WHAT IS THE CROWNING GLORY OF MAN ? 

And what is the crowning glory of man in this earth so far as 
his individual achievement is concerned? It is character — char- 
acter developed through obedience to the laws of life as revealed 
through the gospel of Jesus Christ, who came that we might have 
life and have it more abundantly. Man's chief concern in life 
should not be the acquiring of gold, or of fame, or of material 
possessions. It should not be the development of physical prowess, 
nor of intellectual strength, but his aim, the highest in life, should 
be the development of a Christ-like character. "In the destiny of 
every mortal being," says Phelps, "there is an object more worthy 
of God than happiness. It is character, and the grand aim of man's 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



creation is the development of a grand character. A grand char- 
acter is by its very nature the product of a probationary discipline." 

FOUR PICTURES OF IMPORTANCE AND BEAUTY 

There are four pictures upon which I always love to look. 
Three are imaginary, one is real. The first of these is the picture 
of Christ before Pilate when that Roman official said to the 
angry mob, "Behold the man !" As he said it he pointed to Jesus, 
crowned with thorns, bearing upon his shoulders the purple robe. 
He pointed to one at whom the angry mob sneered, condemned 
as a felon and blasphemer, and yet when he said, "Behold the man !" 
he described one who was perfect in character, who was conqueror 
over weaknesses and temptations, and who could say, as he did to 
his fellow workers, "Peace be unto you! I have overcome the 
world." He is our pattern. 

The other picture is Christ in his youth. Have you not 
admired the paintings of the best artists who have tried to picture 
purity and strength in that young boy of twelve years? I have, 
and I never look upon one of the choicest of these without feeling 
that I am looking upon one who is the embodiment of youthful 
strength, vigor and purity. 

The third is the picture of the boy who, as Hawthorne describes 
him, looked upon the great stone face, and, while thinking of the 
ideals and virtues characterized in that great work of nature, de- 
veloped those same virtues in his own life. 

The fourth is a picture in real life, a youth whose clear eyes 
picture the strength of young manhood and the purity of the life 
he has led. What more beautiful thing can one see in nature than 
that? We love beauty in womanhood, we also love beauty and 
strength in young manhood, and that strength and beauty come 
as a result of true living. 

THE GREATEST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD FOR CHARACTER-BUILDING 

I am grateful this afternoon to be associated with you in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the greatest organ- 
ization in the world for the building of character ; an organization 
which is striving to bring to pass the end and purpose of true 
religion, which is the immortality and eternal life of man. This 
earth life is the probationary state through which every soul must 
pass. By overcoming difficulties and temptation, and by rendering 
service to others, each may develop toward the Christ character 
as he revealed it among men. It is a glorious ideal ; it is inspiring. 

TWO WAYS IN WHICH CHARACTER IS BUILT 

There are two ways in which this character is built in our 
Church. One is positive. In that positive development we ask 
young men and young women to participate in the various organ- 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



113 



izations and the quorums of priesthood. Fathers and mothers, do 
we realize what this means in the development of the character of 
our boys and girls? I have just time to suggest that we go from 
this conference this October with a determination to unite with 
the officers and teachers in these associations in helping them to 
win the interest of our children who participate in these organiza- 
tions — the Primary, the Religion Class, the Sunday School, the 
Mutual Improvement Associations and the Relief Society. I wonder 
why more of our young girls do not join the last named organiza- 
tion, and not leave it entirely to our mothers. But, it may be, that 
the younger women's time is occupied with these other associations 
up to their taking the responsibility of the home. These organiza- 
tions, however, with the seminaries and the Church schools, are but 
auxiliaries in this great organization of character-building. They 
are but helps to the priesthood. No youth in the Church who 
reaches the age of twelve should be excluded because of un- 
worthiness from membership in the Deacons' quorum, and that 
membership should signify a clean life, a prayerful life, faith in the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. Every bishop should ask the boys of his 
ward what their attitude is in regard to these things before he 
ordains them to the priesthood. So throughout the Teachers' 
quorum, and the Priests' quorum. That is but a glimpse of the 
positive means of character-building, bringing our children to 
Christ. 

Now there is alongside these positive means a negative means. 
All through life the Latter-day Saint child is asked to refrain from 
indulgence in things that will tend to weaken character. He is 
asked to keep the Word of Wisdom, he is asked to keep himself 
pure and unspotted from the sin of immorality. That is a wonder- 
ful thing, and especially when the community sentiment in the 
Church upholds that teaching. 

TOBACCO A GROWING EVIL 

There is a growing evil, I fear it is growing in the Church, to 
which I wish to call attention, and ask all these forces to co- 
operate in overcoming, in assisting the youth to resist. I refer 
to the evil of cigarette-smoking. Smoking is, an indulgence which 
tends to weaken manhood and womanhood and to undermine char- 
acter. I have always felt that, and I have wondered recently 
•if thinking so much about it I have not become extreme in my con- 
demnation of the habit. With the view of checking myself I took 
occasion recently to read another book setting forth the supposed 
benefits of cigarette-smoking. It was written expressly to prove 
that cigarette-smoking is not injurious. I tried to be fair as I read 
the two hundred and some odd pages, and I stand today more firmly 
convinced than ever that the cigarette has no defense, particularly 
among youth. The habit is wasteful, but worse than this, it does 
undermine the character of youth and leads to greater evils. The 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



very man who writes so carefully and, as he thinks, so logically 
in the defense of that habit has this to say about its indulgence by 
youth : "It is agreed that the only possible harm that might result 
from over-indulgence in tobacco must come from the nicotine that 
is a natural compound of all tobacco, and man very quickly im- 
munizes himself to the effects of nicotine." This is an acknowl- 
edgement that there is something against which the body must be- 
come immune. The writer continues : "Yellow fever, as every 
one knows, is a horrible and deadly disease, and yet a man who has 
once had it may regard it ever after with the calm indifference 
which an ordinary man regards nicotine." 

I like the comparison. The use of nicotine should be looked 
upon just as we look upon yellow fever. No one will expose him- 
self to that disease merely for the sake of becoming immune. It 
is too great a risk, so sane persons prefer to keep from it entirely. 
That is the pruper attitude also toward the use of tobacco; and 
that is just what the author quoted desires regarding his own boy. 
Says he : 

"I do not believe that growing boys or girls either should use tobacco in 
any form." Bear in mind, fellow workers, this is written by a man who tries 
to prove the beneficial effects of the cigarette. "My own boy," he continues, 
"has now reached the time in life when habits are easily formed. That is the 
age when there naturally arises in him the desire to imitate his elders by 
smoking. Realizing this I persistently urge him, as well as all other lads over 
whom I' believe I may have some influence, to refrain from the use of tobacco 
during their tender years, and quite as persistently do I advise them to refrain 
for the same period from too much meat and from the use of strong spices, 
cocoa^ tea and coffee. But the best of all arguments against the smoking of 
cigarettes by minors seems finally to be the fact that such simoking is unlawful 
in most states of the Union. For my part I wish it were unlawful in every 
state." 

It is unlawful in the State of Utah. And besides these evils 
mentioned by this advocate of smoking for older ones, there is this 
moral danger that youths who participate in smoking frequently do 
it surreptitiously without the knowledge of their parents, thus add- 
ing to it an element of dishonesty, and dishonesty is one of the 
most disintegrating elements in character-building. 

WHAT OUR HOMES SHOULD ESTABLISH 

Our homes should establish the fact that the boy who indulges 
in cigarettes is not contributing to his advancement and growth 
in the Church and Kingdom of God, neither preparing himself for 
his responsible place in society. Today leading business men and 
leading firms throughout the country discriminate in their choice 
between the boy who smokes and the boy who does not smoke, 
favoring the latter always, and in many cases refusing absolutely 
to employ the young man who has contracted the habit of the cigar- 
ette. That is only from an economic standpoint. 

We as Latter-day Saints have a stronger reason and one that 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



115 



points directly to the strength and growth of the character of our 
boys and girls. We heard the opening address of this con- 
ference, from the President of the Church who read the word of 
God to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that tobacco is not good for man. 
The statement is not qualified in any way. Scientists have demon- 
strated it; men who have tried to disprove it have failed, and we as 
a people stand committed to that command of God. Keep the 
habit of smoking and the use of tobacco in any form out of the 
lives of our boys. Resistance of the appetite will react upon the 
character and strengthen it. Just because a man has developed the 
habit is no justification for his continuing it. Just because some 
men may become immune (granting this man's argument), from 
the ill effects, that is no justification for its use in the priesthood of 
God. 

FATHERS AND ELDERS SHOULD BE WORTHY OF IMITATION 

Fathers and elders have the obligation of setting an example 
worthy of imitation to the youth. Boys want to look upon you 
as men. Their ideals incorporate in your life all the Christ-like 
attributes, as near as you can develop them, which Christ had when 
the Roman governor pointed to him, saying, "Behold the man." 
Remember, even though you have the habit, overcoming it will 
make you stronger. 

"It is easy enough to be virtuous 
When nothing tempts you to stray, 
When without or within no voice of sin 
Is luring your soul away. 
But it is only a negative virtue 
Until it is tried by fire, 

And the soul that is worth the honor of earth 
Is the soul that resists desire." 

God bless our boys and our girls ! May they stand out in clear, 
distinct manhood and womanhood to the admiration of all who see 
them, bearing witness that the power of the gospel, as revealed to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith in this dispensation and as being preach- 
ed throughout the world by two thousand of these young men and 
women, is indeed the power of God unto salvation, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

My beloved brethren and sisters : I do not expect to present any- 
thing that is new, in fact we have not heard anything that is new during 
this conference, but we have heard the simple truths of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, which have been from the beginning and which never 
grow old. I trust that what I may add may find a response in your 
hearts, that I may leave some impression that will abide with you 
when you return to your homes.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



god's marvelous work 

As I have listened to the most excellent testimonies and instructions 
that we have received during the sessions of this conference, my mind 
has turned to a prophecy given hundreds of years before the birth of. 
Christ, by one of the prophets of Israel: 

"Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with 
their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far 
from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men": 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this 
people, even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise 
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." 

Thus prophesied Isaiah, speaking of these latter days- The Lord 
by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the year 1829, before 
the organization of the Church, declared that this time was at hand, 
and that he was about to commence his great and marvelous work 
among the children of men. I think it is a great privilege to have 
the opportunity to live in the world when this work is established — this 
marvelous work which is recognized not only by those who have come 
into the Church, but by many who are not in the Church. I look upon 
the kingdom of God. or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
as being the corner stone of this great and marvelous work which the 
Lord was to perform. And as I look over this vast assembly into the 
faces of men who hold the Priesthood, it is impressed more deeply 
upon my mind that there is great significance in this organization, and 
in this Priesthood which has been restored for the salvation of the 
human family. 

WE LIVE IN A MOST WONDERFUL AGE 

We are living in a marvelous age, a most wonderful age. The 
Lord is fulfiling his purposes very rapidly, both among the Latter-day 
Saints and among the peoples of the earth, everywhere. I am fully 
convinced that the time is now here that was also spoken of by another 
of the prophets, who said : 

"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon 
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men 
shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions : 

"And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will 
I pour out my spirit." 

GREAT MODERN INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES 

Of course, it was those who held the Priesthood and who were 
members of the Church, who had made covenant with God, that should 
prophesy and see visions, 'but the Lord was also to pour out his Spirit 
on others beyond the borders of modern Israel. 

I remember sitting in a meeting some thirty or more years ago 
when that meeting was being addressed by one of the members of the 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH ' 117 



Council of Twelve Apostles, who has long since departed this life. 
In the course of his remarks he made a statement that impressed me and 
which has stayed with me since that time. It was to the effect that the 
time would come when men would communicate from city to city, con- 
versing without the aid of the telephone or intervening wires. As I 
pondered over it I thought: Of course, that time will come, but it 
cannot come until after Christ comes again, and his truth shall have 
been acknowledged over the earth during the Millennium. Then 
such great power will be exercised, but even then it will be granted 
to those who are in the Church and to no others. I have lived, however, 
to see the fulfilment of that prediction. I am witnessing it now, as 
no doubt many are who are listening to these services throughout the 
land, for the voice of the speaker is carried abroad in each instance, 
how far I do not know- The voice is heard and recognized, perhaps a 
thousand miles away, and the words leave their impression on the mind 
of those who are listening almost the same as if they were sitting in 
the presence of the speaker, as you are doing. I think this is very 
wonderful ; and yet, this great discovery did not come through revelation 
to a member of the Church ; it was not sent through one who holds the 
Priesthood, but it came through one not of the Church but who was 
inspired of the Lord to give this great blessing to the world. So with 
many other things, the automobile and the airplane as means of trans- 
portation; the talking machine and all of these great discoveries that 
have come through scientific research, they have come, most of them, 
outside of the Church. Yet I maintain that had there been no restor- 
ation of the gospel, and no organization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, there would have been no radio ; there would have 
been no airplane, and there would not have been the wonderful dis- 
coveries in medicine, chemistry, electricity, and the many other things 
wherein the world has been benefited by such discoveries. Under such 
conditions these blessings would have been withheld, for they belong 
to the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times of which the restoration 
of the gospel and the organization of the Church constitute the central 
point, from which radiates the Spirit of the Lord throughout the world. 
The inspiration of the Lord has gone out and takes hold of the minds 
of men, though they know it not, and they are directed by the Lord. 
In this manner he brings them into his service that his purposes and 
his righteousness, in due time, may be supreme on the earth- 

INSPIRATION AND THE GREATER ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE THE 

CAUSE 

Now let me say •^briefly that I do not believe for one moment 
that these discoveries have come by chance, or that they have come 
because of superior intelligence possessed by men today over those 
who lived in ages that are past. They have come and are coming 
because the time is ripe, because the Lord has willed it, and because he 
has poured out his Spirit on all flesh.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I know it is quite generally believed that the people living now 
are more intelligent than were those who lived in former ages. I 
cannot accept this view because, with the understanding I have of 
the restoration of the gospel and of the dealings of our eternal Father 
with his children from the very beginning, I know that he would not 
choose and send into this world inferior intelligences to stand at the 
head of his work. We are informed that in the councils that were 
held in the heavens, when tests were made, the spirits of the men, then 
living in the pre-mortal state in the presence of the Father and the 
Son, were chosen to stand upon the earth in the various ages of the 
world's history to hold particular positions of responsibility because of 
superior intelligence manifested in the spirit world. I am satisfied with 
the thought that among these spirits there was none greater, except the 
Savior of the ,world himself, than the one who was called to stand 
at the head of the human family. So it is not because of greater in- 
telligence, but because, no doubt, of the greater accumulation of 
knowledge together with the inspiration that comes from the Lord as 
he grants it unto men, that we receive the benefit of these blessings. 
The time has come for the Father to gather together in one all things 
in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, that the 
fulness of his work may be consummated. For this reason we are 
seeing and enjoying the great advantages of our time. The prophets 
anciently, I am sure, spoke of these marvelous events that should 
come to pass in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. 

HAS THE RACE PROGRESSED INTELLECTUALLY? 

I have before me an excerpt taken from a lecture delivered on the 
9th day of February, 1925, before the Philosophical Society of Great 
Britain, by Avery H. Forbes, a member of that distinguished body. 
Discussing the question, "Has the race progressed intellectually?" 
he makes this comment: 

"That information, knowledge, facts, have vastly increased is undisputed, 
but that the increase is favorable to the moral nature, or even to the worldly 
wisdom, is yet to be shown." 

He then quotes the following from Alfred Russell Wallace, one 
of the noted scientists of the past century : 

"The great majority of educated persons hold the opinion that we are more 
intellectual and wiser than men of past ages, that our mental faculties have 
increased in power, but the idea is totally unfounded." 

HAS THE RACE MADE MORAL PROGRESS ? 

Then, discussing another problem, "Has the race progressed 
morally?" Mr. Forbes concludes that it has not, but on the contrary, 
with the greater knowledge that has been imparted and the greater 
power to act, men have used these agencies for the creation of greater 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 119 



crime. However,- they have had the means within their hands to 
benefit mankind and to bring about increased righteousness- I think 
his conclusion is in perfect harmony with the revelations of the Lord 
to his people. 

WHERE MUCH IS GIVEN MUCH IS REQUIRED 

In conclusion, I want to call your attention to this fact, that 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who have 
received the greater light and have made greater covenants to serve 
the Lord, are under the necessity of keeping those covenants and 
commandments in righteousness and humility. We are living in perilous 
times, notwithstanding the remarkable wonders and accumulated knowl- 
edge of the present age. This is a day of ungodliness and increased 
iniquity and men everywhere are paying little heed to the command- 
ments of the Lord. These evil conditions which confront us tend to 
lead us from the path of truth. As members of the Church we have 
greater opportunity, because of modern revelation and the Priesthood, 
to serve our fellows and to teach them the ways of eternal life. Let 
us remember the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

"For of him unto whom much is given much is required ; and he who sins 
against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation. 

"Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and 
inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become trans- 
gressors ; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law." 

I would like to present all of this revelation, but you may read 
it yourselves. It is found in section eighty-two of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. I will, however, read one or two more verses : 

"And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you 
may understand my will concerning you ; 

"Or, in other words,_I give unto you direction how you may act before me, 
that it may turn to you for your salvation. 

"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what 
I say, ye have no promise." 

The man who has received the truth and yet will not walk in 
it deserves the greater condemnation. A member of this Church who 
will indulge in the use of tobacco, who will violate the Word of Wisdom, 
who refuses to pay his tithing, to keep the Sabbath day, or who iri 
any other way will not hearken to the word of the Lord, is not loyal 
to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I was thinking, when Brother Rey L. Pratt was speaking of his 
labors in South America, how certain Italian brethren came confessing 
their sins and in humility forsaking them — giving up everything 
in the world for the gospel's sake because they had found the truth, 
how characteristic that is of those who receive the gospel out in the 
world. Yet, here at home in the stakes of Zion, in the shadows of 
Temples, are to be found those who are numbered with the Church who 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



will not keep the commandments of the Lord. Some of them have made 
covenant in holy places, and yet they do not value the truth ; they do 
not value the teachings of the servants of the Lord and they will not 
walk in the knowledge which they possess, much less by every word 
that proceeds forth from the mouth of God- These shall receive the 
greater condemnation. Oh how I wish all who live in the stakes of Zion 
could get the same spirit of humility and faith that is manifested by these 
humble converts out in the world. What a power we would be for 
righteousness. May we seek for it, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
our Lord. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I made a memorandum to speak of the statue which has been 
completed and installed in the Bureau of Information, commemorat- 
ing one of the most remarkable incidents in the history of the Church ; 
namely, the migration to these valleys of men and women in this 
great cause, pulling handcarts and bringing their blankets with them. 
Brother Knaphus has done himself proud in producing this small 
statue, which can be seen in the Bureau of Information building. Some 
of the most heroic and self-sacrificing pioneer work that was ever 
done by those coming to the valleys is accredited to the people who 
came in the handcart companies. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel." 
The benediction was pronounced by Elder C. Alvin Orme, presi- 
dent of the Tooele stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., October 5, 1926. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

On Tuesday morning, October 5, 1926, the conference re-convened. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 
The congregation sang the hymn, "O ye mountains high." 
Prayer was offered by Elder Lewis R. Anderson, of the South 
Sanpete stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "How firm a foundation." 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
Eastern States Mission 

Section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants is a composite revelation, 
by which I mean that it is a revelation that was not written at one time 
on the part of the prophet who received it. It consists of a number 
of brief revelations, received at sundry times between the publication 
of the Book of Mormon and the organization of the Church on the 
6th day of April, 1830. And these revelations were given, for the 
most part, in the upper chamber in the home of Father Peter Whitmer, 
at Fayette, Seneca county, New York state. 

In the first part of this section is the following statement : 

"After it was truly manifested unto this first elder," [meaning the prophet 
Joseph Smith] "that he had received a remission of his sins, he was entangled 
again in the vanities of the world ; 

"But after repenting, and humbling himself sincerely, through faith, God 
ministered unto him by an holy angel, whose countenance was as lightning, and 
whcse garments were pure and white over all other whiteness ; 

"And gave unto him commandments which inspired him; 

"And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before pre- 
pared, to translate the Book of Mormon." 

And, of course, under that inspiration, not only to translate the 
Book of Mormon, but also to send it forth into the world. By these 
same commandments, "which inspired him," he also obtained the res- 
toration of the holy Priesthood; and by the same inspiration he or- 
ganized the Church, and from time to time received communications 
and the visitation of angels which fed the inspiration that had come 
upon him through the commandments of God, until at last he achieved 
that magnificent work which we now know as the restoration of the 
gospel, and the establishment in the earth of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, with its divine mission and commission to 
proclaim the gospel in all the world, and bring salvation unto the 
children of men. 

What I desire more especially to call your attention to this morning 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is this statement: "And gave unto him commandments which inspired 
him"; and under which he achieved all this great work that I have 
briefly outlined. Latter-day Saints, you have these same command- 
ments. Why may not we obtain, also, if not in the superlative degree, 
yet in rich degree, the same inspiration that the prophet of the Lord 
derived from these commandments? I would like to give an illustra- 
tion of how these commandments and the visitation of heavenly beings — 
how the events, these fundamental events in which the Church of 
Christ had its origin — inspired the prophet ; and perhaps we may learn 
from that illustration the lesson of catching the same inspiration.. 
First, let me remark, however, concerning a great principle which 
statesmen recognize, for the principle is expressed in a number of our 
state constitutions, and quite prominently in the constitution of our 
own state, to the effect, that "a frequent recurrence to fundamental 
principles is essential to the maintenance of liberty" ; and so, in like 
manner, a frequent recurrence to the commandments God has given, 
and the great events which have produced God's great latter-day work 
— frequent recurrence to those things cannot do otherwise than to give 
birth to a beautiful white light of inspiration in the souls of those who 
indulge in this recurrence to the commandments of God. 

While the Prophet Joseph was in seclusion, in 1844, he issued 
letters of instruction to the Saints who were just beginning to carry 
on the work of redeeming the dead ; and from- his place of conceal- 
ment he threw a flood of light upon the necessary steps to take in 
perfecting the operation of that great work which had but recently 
been introduced in practice to the Church. It is in section 128 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. I suggest you read all of it, I will only read 
part of it. In the course of writing that inspired instruction, the 
prophet gives an ecstatic review of some of the events out of which the 
Church grew into existence ; and see what comes of it, I pray you : 

"Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of 
gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the 
earth ; glad tidings for the dead ; a voice of gladness for the living and, the 
dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the 
feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion : 
Behold, thy God reigneth ! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of 
God descend upon them ! 

"And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah ! Moroni, an 
angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets — the book to be 
revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette,. Seneca county, 
declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book ! 

"The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil 
when he appeared as an angel of light ! The voice of Peter, James, and John 
in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome 
county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys 
of the kingdom and of the dispensation of the fulness of times! 

"And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, in 
Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the 
travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! 
And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



123 



and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all 
declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty 
and glory and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept 
upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding 
forth that which is to come, confirming our hope ! 

"Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause ? Go forward and not back- 
ward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your heats rejoice, 
and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead 
speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, 
before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their 
prison; for the prisoners shall go free. 

"Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye 
seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King ! And ye rivers, and 
brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of 
the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, 
moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for 
joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And 
again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our 
ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life ; king- 
doms, principalities, and powers !" 

David, in the Psalms, has not equalled that ecstasy. I know of 
no passage in human literature that rises to the grandeur and sub- 
limity of these thoughts of our Prophet as he reviews the command- 
ments of God and the great events in which the work, of which he 
was the prophet, seer and revelator, had its birth, and its growth, and 
its development. It is generally accorded that the imagery of our 
National Anthem, America, is splendid. A verse or two runs as 
follows : 

"My native country, thee, 
Land of the noble, free, 

Thy name I love : 
I love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills ; 
My heart with rapture thrills, 

Like that above. 

Let music swell the breeze, 
And ring from all the trees 

Sweet freedom's song; 
Let mortal tongues awake, 
Let all that breathe partake ; 
Let rocks their silence break, 

The sound prolong !" 

That is regarded as very splendid imagery, poetry. I wish some- 
times our congregations in this house would sing it more frequently, in 
our conferences. While this is regarded as fine imagery, how tame in 
comparison with that more splendid imagery that stirred and inspired 
the soul of our Prophet when he contemplated the commandments of 
God and the facts in which this work had its origin and which I have 
just read to you. Well, Joseph Smith drew inspiration from that 
contemplation and from the commandments of God he received. And 
it is important that from time to time we gather in these conferences 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and have our minds refreshed with these things, because in these 
general conferences we do make frequent references to these things — 
we have frequent recurrence to fundamental facts in which our Church 
had its origin There is something real in this frequent recurrence to 
fundamental principles, just as real are they as when we partake of the 
holy Sacrament, the symbols of our salvation; the broken bread and 
the water representing the broken body and the shed blood of our 
Lord. By partaking of these symbols in remembrance of him, though 
they are material things, this bread and this water, although they are 
but words that make up that most splendid prayer of consecration, yet 
they evoke in the soul a spiritual power that is as palpably food to 
the spirit of man as is the material food that he partakes of to 
strengthen 'his body from day to day. So it js in contemplating these 
commandments of God and the great events in which our Church had 
its origin. They do impart a spiritual uplift, they do give impetus to 
the spiritual forces, and raise to higher levels the ideals of the Saints. 
They lift the Saints above the normal, and draw them close into 
fellowship with God. The volume and quality of faith are renewed, and 
are made to blaze forth with a clearer light, with greater warmth, that 
carries the Saints 'through the trying affairs of life, over all the dis- 
appointments of it, and makes faith triumphant in their souls. 

I rejoice that we may have access to these sources of inspiration. 

By the way, many of you doubtless have read Victor Hugo's account 
of the street gamin, Gavroche, I think, was the name. He was with 
a band of insurgents attempting a revolution in Paris, and chancing 
to overhear that the ammunition of the insurgents was giving out, he 
took a soldier's haversack, crept over the breastworks of the insurgents, 
and under the screen of the smoke in the streets, went from corpse to 
corpse of the soldiery whom the insurgents had shot down, and whom 
their comrades had left dead in the street, gathering the unfired 
cartridges from their belts. As he went he sang his defiance to those 
who were firing at the barricade, and at him. Sometimes a bullet 
would strike a dead man with a cold thud. "Ah," he would say, "they 
are killing my dead for me;" Then again a bullet would strike fire 
from the pavement, but there was nothing that could daunt 'the young 
gamin. He went from corpse to corpse, gathering - ammunition and 
singing his defiance. Presently a bullet truck him and he fell to 
the pavement, but not to remain there. The touch of the pavement 
seemed to give the gamin life, and he arose to renew his defiance. 
The touch of the pavement seemed to give the inspiration of life to 
him, as touch of the earth seemed to give vigor and strength to 
Antaeus, the wrestler of old mythology, who was invincible so long as 
he could keep contact with the earth. So with Hugo's gamin and tha 
pavement— touch of it seemed to renew his life. So let it be with us 
when we touch the commandments of God, may they impart to us 
light and power and inspiration that shall renew our strength. As the 
aerie to the eagle; as the bugle to the war horse; as sight of the flag 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



125 



to the patriot, and the drum-beat to the soldier, so let frequent re- 
currence to the commandments of God, and to the great events in 
which our Church had its origin give inspiration and spirit life to us. 

I rejoice that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
gradually gathering into its control the sacred places where great his- 
torical events happened. I am sure that it will tend to intensify our 
remembrance of those events. I remember the effect the general con- 
ference of the Eastern States mission had upon our young mission- 
aries — the conference that was held at the Hill Cumorah in 1923, 
celebrating the one hundreth anniversary of the revealed existence 
of the Book of Mormon. I noticed the effect on a group of mission- 
aries only a few days ago of a visit to the Memorial Cottage and the 
monument that mark the birthplace of our prophet. It seemed to 
inspire them with confidence and faith in what they had heard of 
him. I rejoice that we have these places. I rejoice that [we have 
the Joseph Smith Farm, the farm on which the prophet toiled in 
his boyhood, and where some of the important revelations of Gqd 
were given to him. I never visit that place but what I feel that I am 
living in the atmosphere of the great events that took place there. 
The most uplifting, sanctifying and glorifying inspiration that I have 
ever experienced has been in the Sacred Grove where the Lord ap- 
peared unto him who was to become the New Witness for God in 
the dispensation of the fulness of times. I am' happy in the oppor- 
tunity of visiting that place and of receiving the sacrament of the 
Lord's Supper there, from time to. time. I rejoice that recently, acting 
under instructions from the First Presidency, we were able to secure 
the place where the Church was born, the house in which, as I now 
believe, the Church was organized. I know that that is disputed, and. 
that a house is referred to about one hundred feet or more from the 
house that now stands, that was destroyed, and is said to be the old 
Whitmer home and occupied by the prosperous Whitmer family during 
the time that the Prophet Joseph was a guest at their home, and in 
which he organized the Church. We now have a complete abstract of 
title with the name of every man and woman through whom the title 
has passed; and I think we shall be able to patiently investigate the 
matter until we arrive at the absolute truth as to whether or not the 
house now standing there is the old Peter Whitmer home. If that 
is not the house, we don't want to hold forth to the world that it is; 
but if it is really the home of the Whitmer family, where these revela- 
tions in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants were given at sundry 
times, and where the Church was organized — if really we have that 
house, what a treasure it is ! And what an inspiration it will be to 
the Church to be conscious of the fact that we do possess it. It 
was to this home that the Prophet Joseph, his wife Emma and Oliver 
Cowdery were brought by David Whitmer from Harmony, Pennsylva- 
nia, and were received as guests ; and where the Prophet completed the 
translation of the Book of Mormon. As soon as it was completed, the 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prophet, by messenger, sent the glad word to his parents living at 
their home in Manchester township, and they with Martin Harris im- 
mediately repaired to the Whitmer home, where the prophet took the 
step necessary to obtain the testimony of the Three Witnesses. That 
testimony was received in a grove that then existed either on or near 
the Whitmer farm. They had prayer in the morning at the Whitmer 
home, for the Whitmer family were devout Christian people. Old 
father Peter Whitmer was a member of that strictest of sects, the 
Presbyterians. He was a sincere and good Presbyterian and followed 
the practice of prayer at his family altar. The day after the arrival of 
the prophet's father and mother and Martin Harris, as they completed 
prayer that morning, the Prophet Joseph walked across the room, and 
speaking directly to Martin Harris, he said in effect : Martin Harris, 
you must repent. You must humble yourself before the Lord this 
day as you have never done before, and get a forgiveness of your sins ; 
and if you will do this you shall, with Oliver Cowdery and David 
Whitmer, obtain a view of the plates from which the Book of Mormon 
is translated. 

Shortly after breakfast the four named went out into the woods, as 
I have said, and there supplicated the Lord with- the result that they 
beheld the plates and the engravings thereon, and they heard the voice 
of God proclaim that the translation was true and he commanded them 
to bear witness of it to all the world. 

In my interview with David Whitmer, in 1884, as he went over 
this ground, led by my questions, when we came to this part of it he 
said to me that in the progress of turning the leaves, or having them 
turned by Moroni, and looking upon the engravings, Moroni looked 
directly at him and said : "David, blessed is he that endureth to the 
end." When David Whitmer made that remark it seemed to me rather 
a peculiar thing that he should thus be singled out for such a remark, 
and I remember reporting it as such to President John Morgan, then 
president of the Southern States mission. I stated to him the peculiar 
feelings I had when I learned that from the lips of David Whitmer; 
but the subsequent history of these three witnesses led me to conclude 
that there was indeed a hidden warning in the words of the angel to 
David, "Blessed is he that endureth to the end." And it is rather 
a sad reflection that of these three witnesses he was the only one 
who died outside of membership in the Church. I wonder if Moroni 
was not trying to sound a warning to this stubborn man, that perhaps 
whatever his experiences and trials might be, that at the last he, too, 
might have been brought into the fold, and might have died within 
the pale of the Church. 

Well, the foregoing mentioned incidents are the sacred associa- 
tions connected with the Whitmer Farm in addition to the fact that it 
was the place where the Church of Jesus Christ was organized, and 
the First President of the Church sustained under the title of the first 
Elder of the Church, with Oliver Cowdery as the second Elder in 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



127 



the Church. I feel satisfied that we are going to get added inspiration 
from the fact that we own our birthplace and our cradle. I would 
like to point out some other things, but time will not permit, except 
to say this : There are those who undertake to say that Joseph Smith 
was a fallen prophet, and that in the latter years of his life he marred 
his mission, and that he was a fallen prophet. A fallen prophet! 
What ? And yet, give a sunburst of inspiration like that which I have 
read to you here from the Doctrine and Covenants, given in 1842? 
Out upon it ! It could not be true. He who voiced that reverence for 
God, and had that exalted spirit awakened within him by contemplating 
the early scenes of his mission — as I have read to you — is no fallen 
prophet. His life ended en crescendo. It grew richer, it grew greater 
as it neared its close. His nearness to God was emphasized more in the 
closing years of his life than ever before. The revelations that he gave 
increased in power and magnificence. And so, too, in his discourses, 
they grew in magnificence and power as he proclaimed God's great 
and mighty truths in the last few months of his life. The Saints of 
God who witnessed the inspiration of God upon him, come to us 
with testimonies of his increasing power as a Prophet of God in the 
latter years of his life. Joseph Smith was no fallen prophet, nor could 
he be and give such evidence of inspiration both in the revelations 
he received, and in the great sermons that he delivered near the close 
of his life, such as the King Follett sermon, and other great discourses. 
I rejoice in this evidence of the inspiration of our prophet, the grandeur 
of his work and the evidence that we gather of the truth of it from 
these things we have considered. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

It has been a number of years since I have followed Elder Roberts 
in the pulpit. The first time I ever saw President Roberts was in 
Chattanooga, Tennessee. The first time I ever heard him preach the 
gospel was in Burk's Garden. I confess, at that time and for a con- 
siderable length of time afterwards, I was always awe-struck, and 
almost beaten into silence when asked to follow him in his public 
addresses. But I am thankful to the Lord that I have gotten over it, that 
I no longer feel that way. It has been a fight all my life to follow men 
who have great ability and who were greatly blessed as public speakers. 
My lesson came to me in this way, that I discovered that no man was 
ever created that could reach all the people at one time, and I figured 
that there must be some poor soul with bowed head who was dis- 
couraged and disheartened to whom I might, through the blessings of 
the Lord, and under the influence of his holy Spirit, give a word of 
cheer ; and it has proved to be true, for I think now of several occasions 
— three distinct places, I remember at the present moment, at different 
times when persons met me on the street disheartened. 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



They had fallen by the way; they saw no way out- of their diffi- 
culties, and were in a suicidal condition. For the first one who came 
to me in that condition I had no answer. I did not know what to do. 
"Why didn't you go to your bishop? Why did you come to me?" 
"Brother Kimball, I heard you preach, and I thought there might be a 
chance." In those cases I went to the Presidency of the Church, and 
that is where I learned the great magnanimity and the charitableness 
and bigness of the Presidency of the Church. In each of those cases 
I was used as an instrument. They never asked me the names of 
the young men, they simply wanted me to take up a labor with them, 
and if they repented I was authorized, not by the bishop nor the 
president of the stake, in those particular cases, but by the Presidency 
of the Church, and the young men were baptized, they were confirmed, 
and they were started out to serve God and as far as I know7 in each 
and every case, they made good. 

I remember one young man, highly cultured and educated in the 
University of Utah. I will never forget that young man, no matter how 
long I live. It was at the time of the World War, and he had been 
unfortunate. I did not know him; I never saw him before. He came 
to me in great distress. I went to the Presidency and that young 
man repented, and he was baptized and confirmed. He went into the 
war, became a lieutenant, and the last I heard of him— he wrote me 
several times — his letter stated : "I know God forgave me, for I have 
felt the influence of his holy Spirit in the army, that has brought me 
joy and peace and happiness." - 

So that I feel to encourage the priesthood of God. We never know 
how much good we do when we speak in the name of the Lord. I don't 
believe, I can't believe, that I ever converted a man in my life, but 
I have taught the truth, I have preached the gospel, and my voice 
has been heard from Canada to Mexico, more times than one. I was 
in the General Board of the Young Men's Association for thirty years, 
and I have never had greater joy or greater happiness than in lifting 
up my voice among the rising generation. How much good we do, 
as I stated before, no man knoweth. I claim that every man fills his 
niche when he is called of God and set apart and ordained to an office. 
He may not fill it in the way someone else fills it, but if he is a man of 
courage he will fill it in his own way, under the influence of the holy 
Spirit. 

I have no apology to make for my origin. I was told once that 
my trouble was, I was trying to be like my father. Well, thank God 
I can try to be like him a little, but I was too young, when my father 
died, to remember his mannerisms and his method of speech. 

My brethren and sisters, in conclusion I want to lift up a danger 
signal to the rising generation. In doing it I' want to be very careful 
the way in which I express it, so I shall attempt to read it, although 
it is against my grain to do so. In our great city with its wonderful 
streets, I can't but think of the danger that menaces the people. 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

We see your red lights, we see your green lights, and the officers of 
this city are doing everything in their power to protect the people, but 
the people do not pay any attention to the signals — some of them do 
not. There is nothing else annoys me so much as for a man to run 
on to me with one of those great, powerful machines, and just before 
hitting me, honk his horn. My legs go right from under me. I 
can't even hit a trot, and the feeling I have is that he is saying: "Get 
out of the way, we are coming." I got that the other night on First 
North street here. I can see only one way at a time, and then I am 
not quite clear, but I had to see four ways that night. Here came 
two machines around that corner, with these cars all parked right 
up to the corner, and they tried to beat each other through and caught 
me in the center. The only thing that saved my life was my being thin. 
I am not trying to be funny, I am trying to be serious. Now all these 
danger signals with your yellow marks — I have stood there and watched 
the lights, listened to the bell, and yet last year, if I remember right, 
the automobiles killed over twenty thousand people in the United States, 
one-half, perhaps, as many as were killed in the World War — referring, 
of course, to the American soldiers. Now I don't want to get killed. 
What I am worried about is that they might not make a good job of it 
I would hate to be maimed and crippled for life through the careless' 
ness of men and women. Now I want to set up signals that are a 
hundred thousand times more important than dodging autos : 

IMPRESSIONS AND REFLECTIONS 

Shall we be brave, courageous men, standing upon the secure heights 
of virtue and righteousness where God's sun shines, and preach the 
truth and cry repentance unto this people? 

This great country, America, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, 
is Zion, North and South America, the pure in heart. It would seem 
to me that this great responsibility rests almost entirely with the young 
men and women of this generation. 

The question naturally arises : What is the trend of the times for 
the modern sons and daughters of Zion ? Riches and culture, ease and 
luxury. Everything is money and money is everything. 

The Golden Key unlocks all doors, that is, it prys them open. 

Plenty of money entitles you to anything and everything, honor, 
society and emoluments. The rising generation, who are poor, look 
upon this pleasure-loving people with envy and a yearning for worldly 
things, and as the spirit of the age in which we live takes hold of them, 
they assert their individual independence and break away from what 
is called "old fogy ideas, old bigotries, old superstitions," and go 
recklessly wild, at sixty miles an hour, claiming what is termed the 
"new Liberty of the twentieth century," and run daringly into forbidden 
pastures Today all over America we see everywhere amongst the 
rich and poor, the cultured, educated and ignorant, the indications of the 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sensual tendencies of the age, forgetting for the moment the degradation 
and destruction to which such a life leads. 

No single instance can be given as evidence that unlawful sensual 
pleasure can be indulged in without paying for it a thousand times in 
pain and remorse. 

"The danger signals are set up at the gate of the garden of sensunl 
pleasure, and the angel stands with his sword of flame, and no man, 
woman, youth or maiden enters unsmitten of him." "In the path of 
sensuality in all its multiplied forms our heavenly Father has placed 
barriers mountain high to stop us and frighten us back from ruin, 
disease and degradation." 

As wealth increases in any country and with any people, the 
tendency to sensuality, through the many temptations of ease, idleness 
and gratification of ones appetite, the elevation of fashion, style and in 
living beyond a certain point of safety and security, is the cause of the 
downfall of hundreds of thousands of God's children. 

"That 'money devil', if not used in doing good, is the lion right across the 
highway of our future, standing, teasing, menacing — just at the forks of the 
road, to lead us to ruin and unhappiness. If the roofs could be lifted off the 
palaces of the rich, what sights might not be seen, what skeletons in the closets, 
what sorrows, what shams, what sights." — Watson. 

If we open our eyes to the danger that menaces the rising genera- 
tion, life would seem to be a very dangerous sea, if we take note of the 
ruined thousands that strew its shores. 

We therefore cannot look upon death as a great sorrow and 
calamity, when it involves no stain of honor and no loss of character. 
We wisely conclude the hand of Providence is in it and good must come 
out of it and we are comforted. 

When we contemplate and think of our young men and women 
with their bright hopes of love, of truth and purity, of honor, of 
manhood and womanhood, of genius and talent, of all goodly gifts 
from God, of mind, of all sweet affections, and aspirations, gone down, 
blotted out and spoiled, we cannot feel otherwise, be as hopeful and 
cheerful as we may, that life is dangerous unless we are guided and 
influenced by the holy Spirit and directed by steady hands, by men 
and women as teachers of virtue, truthfulness and happiness, who are 
not afraid to speak in the name of the Lgrd. 

The fruit of religion manifests itself in the lives of men. By 
their fruits ye shall know them. There can be no deception by men 
who love God and keep his commandments. We are one and all God's 
children. He created us and he never created a failure, and he created 
you. 

Men are that they might have joy. Happiness is the object and 
design of our creation and will be to the end of our existence if we 
pursue the path that leads to it. This path is virtue, uprightness, 
faithfulness, holiness. To keep God's commandments we must know 
them. To know them we must read the scriptures and reoent and 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



131 



be in tune with the holy Spirit and he will lead us into all truth and 
show us things to come. I promise you that you shall hear a voice 
behind you saying, this is the way, walk ye in it. 

Remember this always : Temptation somewhere in the life of all 
finds us, as this life is a testing time. Therefore, watch and pray and 
ask God to leave us not in temptation but deliver us from evil, as 
temptation is ever lying in wait and in a thousand forms is temptation 
repeated. 

There is divine wisdom in praying always and avoiding the very 
appearance of evil. 

There is very little use of preaching religion or morals, or honesty, 
virtue and truthfulness to those whose motives and tendencies all point 
toward vice and sensuality unless they repent and sin no more. These 
wild, reckless, dissipated young people will not come to us, we must 
reach out a helping hand and go to them. 

This great change for the uplift and betterment of this great 
country — Zion, the pure in heart — rests very largely, almost entirely, 
with the home and the parents. 

We must, for the safety of the youth of Zion, come back to Jesus 
Christ's religion and its spiritual forces. We must teach the gospel of 
repentance and forgiveness which has made men's and women's lives 
happier, tasks lighter, judgment steadier, as it truly comforts the discon- 
solate, forgotten sinner, and makes to them a clear life of virtue, love 
and happiness. 

No child of God can escape Christ's religion, intelligence and 
knowledge, of the right kind, walks ever close to religion. 

My conclusion is : There is just one great, big, life-and-death duty 
of the parents of children, the Church and the State, and that is, to 
keep every boy and girl under proper schooling and give to them 
"love, pleasure, work and worship." 

You good people and parents living in the country, on your farms, 
I plead with you not to send your children to cities where the beautiful 
spirit of things God created perish. 

Let them live in the open, in the beautiful valleys, on the moun- 
tains, in God's sunshine, near streams, rivers, and trees and let his 
Spirit teach them of the things of God. 

My testimony, brethren and sisters, in all confidence, is that I know 
this work is true. I have tested it out. I have found God. I' am a man 
of weakness ; I am a man full of faults ; but God knows I have given 
him the best effort there was in me. i' know God lives, that Jesus 
Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world ; and when men 
have tempted me to deny this — which they have tried to do — I have 
talked to some of them, learned men, I have talked to doctors, I have 
talked to young men who have gone out and filled missions, come home 
and got education, and they have tried to burn all my bridges behind 
me ; but, thank God, I had a testimony, and I knew ! I have told them : 
"in what you offer me there is no happiness." If any man can prove 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to me that Joseph Smith is not a prophet of God, he has taken every- 
thing; he has burned every bridge behind me. I never saw the Prophet, 
but I have heard my father often talk about him and I have read his 
revelations and his prophecies, as a witness for God, and I know they 
are true. He is a prophet of God. I sustain the Church and uphold 
the hands of the priesthood as best I know how. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I earnestly hope that I may enjoy the spirit of the Lord while 
I sta'nd before you. It seems to me that anyone who has made himself 
at all familiar with the history of the world must be deeply impressed 
with the fact that God has been over all, that he has directed the des- 
tinies of his children here upon this planet. Notwithstanding this, 
however, he has given unto them their free agency, for he has decreed 
that men shall be free from the very beginning. 

The Lord asked his servant Job : "Where wast thou when I 
laid the foundations of the earth? * * * when the morning stars 
sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" 

Modern revelation has made it plain what this occasion was. The 
proclamation of God's plan of salvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
in which the free agency of man obtains. In order to carry out this 
plan it was necessary to create this earth where God's children might 
receive bodies of flesh an4 bone and, the recollection of their spirit 
life being withheld from them, and with a knowledge of good and 
evil, they might be proved whether, in the exercise of their free agency, 
they would "do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall com- 
mand them." The creation of a world land redeeming it from the 
fajll, which was also contemplated, required the service of One en- 
dowed with Godlike power and the Lord said: "Whom shall I send? 
And one answered like unto the Son of man: Here am I, send me." 
Father thy will be done and the glory be thine forever. But Satan 
also came, even Lucifer, a son of the morning and said : Behold here 
am I, send me, I will be thy son and I will redeem all mankind that 
one soul shall not be lost and surely I will do it ; wherefore give me 
thine honor. "And the Lord said : I will send the first." And Satan 
rebelled against God and was cast down and many followed after him. 

Thus it was that the First Born in the spirit, and the Only Begotten 
in the flesh, became the great champion of human liberty from the very 
beginning, and throughout all the history of the world. 

Let us for a few moments contemplate some of the things that 
have transpired in the history of the world, the rise and fall of great 
empires, the mighty battles for human liberty which have been fought. 

Who cannot see the overruling hand of Providence? When 
Miltiades, the hero of the battle of Marathon, with a small army of 
9,000 men defeated and put to rout 100,000 Persians, 6,000 of whom 
fell upon the battlefield with ja loss to the Greek army of only 192, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



133 



who can doubt that they were aided and upheld by an Almighty power 
directing the destiny of mankind? The freedom of the world was 
hanging in the balance. Which shall prevail, Asiatic despotism and 
superstition, or the new freedom and civilization? And ten years later, 
Xerxes, with the largest army ever mustered in the history of the world, 
until the great world war, invaded Greece but was held at Thermopylae 
for days by Leonidas and his brave 300 Sparitans ; every one of whom, 
however, died in defending the country rather than surrender, thus 
bringing upon themselves a fame and glory that shall endure as long 
as time shall last. 

Then Themistocles, commander of the naval forces, learning of 
the Persians, final passage through the pass at Thermopylae on their 
way to Athens, boarded the inhabitants of that city on his ships and 
conveyed them to Salamis, and then with his 350 war galleys attacked 
the Persian fleet of 1,200 ships which had already sustanied severe 
losses and had been thrown into confusion by the violent storms which 
they encountered on the sea. Again the Persians were put to rout and 
sustained a loss of 200 ships. In the following year the land forces 
continued to fight until September, when the Athenians and their 
allies with an army of 70,000 men, under command of Aristides, fought 
the final battle at Plataea and on the same day the combined naval 
and military forces of the Spartans, Athenians and their allies under 
Prince Pausanias defeated the Persians by land and by sea at and 
off Mt. Mycale, just opposite the Island of Samos. Who can read 
of these thrilling and soul-stirring events without a sincere feeling 
of gratitude to the Greeks for the great service they rendered to man- 
kind in the great cause of human liberty, and who can doubt that they 
were guided and upheld by an overruling Providence, whose cause 
is our cause, even the cause of Liberty. It does not detract from the 
honor due to the Greeks to say that God used them as instruments in 
his hand to further his divine purposes. Surely Providence is over 
all. History is replete with illustrations : the conquests of Alexander, 
the great; we heard yesterday how through him the Greek language 
became the language of his empire and became the medium of pub- 
lishing to the world the gospel of Jesus Christ which is the truth that 
shall make men free indeed. 

Not always have the victories of great men been based upon the 
principles of righteousness ; nevertheless the purposes of the Almighty 
cannot be defeated, for he overrules in all, and often "moves in a 
mysterious way his wonders to perform." 

Shall I mention Julius Caesar, Napoleon Boneparte and Gustavus 
Adolphus, the "Lion of the North," Luther, Melanchton and Zwingli, 
and the other great reformers? Time will not permit, but in the 
achievements and victories of each and all of these great men, one can- 
not but see and recognize the Divine purpose in breaking the chains 
of superstition, intolerance and slavery, and leading mankind out of 
the darkness that covered the earth and the gross darkness in which 
the people were benighted. 

Was not the great Columbus inspired of the Lord to cross the 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



unknown seas and discover the western world? What a wonderful 
stride in the cause of human liberty ! America, a choice land above all 
other lands, withheld during the many centuries of the past to become 
a place of refuge for the downtrodden peoples of the old world, to 
become the habitation of free men where no kings shall oppress or hold 
the reins of government, as the Nephite prophets have foretold, and 
how literally have their predictions been fulfilled ! 

Then came Washington, the father of his country, who fought the 
revolutionary battles which gave us our national independence ; Hamil- 
ton, the constructive genius of the constitution of our country, and 
Jefferson, that great champion of the rights of men, who wrote the 
Declaration of Independence and inspired his fellow-countrymen with 
love for the principles of human liberty. 

Another mighty champion arose in the coming of Abraham Lin- 
coln, the great emancipator, who broke the chains of slavery and fought 
that these precious principles for which our revolutionary fathers had 
fought "might not perish from the earth." And later still came 
Woodrow Wilson, who, when the freedom of the world was in im- 
minent danger, led the forces of America in the greatest conflict that 
the world had ever known, that it might be made safe for democracy. 

Great and mighty are these men of America. How our hearts 
swell with patriotic pride when we contemplate their achievements. Let 
us then honor them, and let me here say that we honor them most 
when we say, as all Latter-day Saints do say, that God raised them 
up and inspired them with his holy Spirit for the futherance of his 
great cause, the cause of human liberty. Let us not think even for a 
moment that liberty is the gift of any government or any nation. Oh, 
no ! Life and liberty are our inalienable rights and were vouchsafed unto 
us in that primeval council when our great champion, even Jesus Christ, 
said : "Here am I, send me" for he came and organized this earth as 
a dwelling place for the children of God, for you and me: 

To live and to be free, 
To worship God alone 
As conscience guideth me, 
As my own heart is prone ; 
For these are rights God given, 
He gave them all to me, 
They emanate from heaven, 
E'en life and liberty. 

This is the thought that comes into my mind when I contemplate 
the history of the world, that Providence is over all. 

This human liberty for which these mighty men, to whom I have 
alluded, have struggled, great and glorious though it is, is after all only 
a measure of civil liberty. There is a greater freedom to which we 
should aspire ; for, let it be known that even in this great and glorious 
republic, the greatest one that ever existed upon the face of the earth, 
where the greatest measure of human liberty is meted out to our 
Father's children, in this land of the free and home of the brave, we 
are not free. "The whole world lieth in sin and groaneth under dark- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



135 



ness and under the bondage of sin," but the truth that emanated from 
God, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, that was proclaimed in that 
primeval day shall make us free indeed if we will only receive and 
obey it. And who have been the champions of this greater freedom? 
First and foremost of all was the Redeemer of mankind, he that was 
in the beginning. He came in the meridian of time and ministered the 
law of liberty and freedom among the children of men. Many others 
have been sent, other great and noble ones, but I shall not take the 
time to enumerate them all but there was Abraham, whom God chose 
among the great ones, for he knew him before he was born and chose 
him to become the father of the faithful. And there was Moses, to 
whom the Lord gave the perfect law of liberty, even the gospel of 
Jesus Christ which is the higher law. But the children of Israel were 
not prepared for that great law of liberty, that higher law, and the 
plates upon which it was engraven were broken. Mpses went up into 
the mount again and returned with the law of carnal commandments, 
that the people might repent of sin. It was the gospel of repentance ; 
"Thou shalt not kill ; thou shalt not commit adultery ; thou shalt not 
steal." These great commandments have been thundered down to us 
through all the ages from Mount Sinai, and are still in force among 
the children of men. Why? That they might be liberated from the 
bondage of sin. 

At all times these champions of liberty have been opposed by that 
arch enemy of God, even Statan, that rebelled against God in the begin- 
ning, and those who followed after him, and, as always, through human 
instrumentality, they killed the prophets, they persecuted the saints, they 
crucified the Savior of the world and put to death his apostles, those 
mighty men of God who preached his gospepl in all the then .known 
world, and transmitted their testimony in holy writ for the generations 
which were to come. Surely power was given unto Satan to make war 
with the Saints and overcome them as John the Revelator tells us. 

The darkness that followed these tragic events has been rightly 
called the dark ages, and was only partly dispelled by the great re- 
formers who were, however, not reformers but protestants who made 
effective protest against the darkness and tyranny that held the world 
in spiritual bondage and most abominable idolatry. 

All these, together with the discovery of America and the founding 
of our glorious republic under the guiding hand of Providence, were 
the necessary preliminary preparations for the restoration of his 
glorious gospel and the setting up of his Church and kingdom upton 
the earth, never to be thrown down nor given to another people ; where 
the perfect law of liberty shall be supreme and mankind shall be liber- 
ated from the bondage of sin, and Satan shall be bound for a thou- 
sand years during the great millennial reign of peace when Christ shall 
be ouif king and subdue all enemies under his feet. 

Therefore God raised up another champion of human liberty even 
Joseph Smith the great prophet of the latter days, to usher in this 
glorious dispensation, the climax of which, not yet _ attained, shall be 
the second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But Satan, not yet bound, came again. I presume he will con- 
tinue to come until the great battle will be fought on the field of 
Armageddon. So he came in the days of Joseph Smith through whom 
the gospel had been restored, and the Church of Christ had again been 
established on the earth. Through the human instrumentality of a 
cruel mob, he was murdered in cold blood, another prophet of the living 
God ; but not until those principles which have within them the power 
of God unto salvation, the principles that liberate mankind from the 
bondage of sin, had been established among the Saints of the latter 
days. Let us then carry on the work so well begun until its final con- 
summation. Let us rejoice in the assurance which we have of its final 
triumph. And may our hearts be filled with gratitude to our heavenly 
Father that he has fought our battles and will lead us on to victory 
if we will do our part. And let us put our trust in him and have an 
abiding faith that "Providence is over all." This is my earnest prayer 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Come let us anew our journey pursue." 
The .benediction was pronounced by Elder J. Berkeley Larson, 
president of the Shelley stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



CONCLUDING SESSION 

On Tuesday afternoon, October 5, 1926, the concluding session 
of the ninety-seventh Semi-Annual Conference was held in the Taber- 
nacle. All the seats in the main hall and galleries were comfortably 
filled. 

President Heber J. Grant presided, and at 2 o'clock announced that 
the congregation would sing, "Earth with her ten thousand flowers." 

After singing, prayer was offered by Elder Wallace Calder, presi- 
dent of the Uintah stake of Zion. 

The Congregation sang, "Do what is right, the day-dawn is 
breaking." 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

President of the California Mission 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that during the short time I 
occupy this position I may be sustained by your faith and sympathy 
and by the blessing and inspiration of the holy Spirit. I feel that it 
is a very important thing to stand in this pulpit, and claim the attention 
of so large a number of people. I am very thankful for the oppor- 
tunity and feel it is a very great honor. 

I am glad to be able to say to this congregation that in the 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



137 



California mission we are still endeavoring, to the best of our ability, 
to bring to the attention of the people of- that mission the wonderful 
work of the Lord. We. continue to bear testimony concerning its 
restoration and the manner in which it was brought from heaven to 
earth, and to testify concerning the divine authority which has always 
been essential for man whenever the Lord has had a message to de- 
liver to the inhabitants of the earth. 

We number in missionaries in California about 140, a little more 
than 40 of this number being lady missionaries, and the remainder being 
as a rule young men, 'most of whom were ordained elders in the Church 
as they received their call to go abroad as representatives of the work of 
the Lord. • 

I have been thinking, during this conference, particularly when 
Elder Orson F. Whitney was talking to the people, of the long ago in 
my own missionary experience- I went out forty-five years ago in 
company with Brother Orson F. Whitney and a few other brethren 
who were called at the general conference to go to Great Britain and 
to other sections of the European mission. I have a most distinct 
recollection of reading, in a little journal that I kept while on that 
mission, words that had been written during the first few days of my 
missionary labors. I was sent into the county of Ayre in Scotland 
and my lot was cast with a coal mining community. Of course, the 
experience that I had at the beginning of my ministry was something 
altogether strange and new to me. When I was released to return home, 
as I was packing up, that little journal that I kept accidentally opened 
before my eyes, and I read a statement to this effect: "Here I am, 
far from my home and people. God help me-" Those words told the 
story. I certainly felt that I was a stranger in a strange land. I 
wondered whether it would be possible for me to continue in that 
community as a representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints for the period of time that usually falls to the lot of a 
missionary. In those first few days I did not feel that it would be 
possible, and yet, thanks be to God and to his marvelous providences, 
and I trust and believe to the help and light and companionship of 
the holy Spirit, I was not only enabled to remain in the mission field 
during the allotted time, but I found during that period that wonderful 
joy which is spoken of by missionaries who have endeavored in their 
weak and humble manner to expound the doctrines of the gospel, in- 
viting men and women to an investigation of the message revealed by 
the Lord our God. I have thought of that period during these con- 
ference proceedings. I have had the pleasure of meeting with many 
missionaries who have labored in California during the past few days ; 
and I am happy to say that these missionaries with whom I have met 
have expressed the feeling unanimously, I think, that they would be 
very happy indeed if opportunity could be given them, and financial 
conditions were favorable, to return again and take up their missionary 
work. 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It gives me pleasure to report to the fathers and mothers who may 
be in this congregation that so far as the California mission is con- 
cerned, we feel that we have been abundantly blessed of our Father 
in heaven during the past six months. The missionaries of the mission 
have had better health during that period than during any similar 
period of my ministry as president. We have had but very little 
sickness. We have not had any serious illness among the missionaries, 
and we feel to praise the name of the Lord our God for his blessings 
unto us. 

It is a satisfaction to be able to report that we are a little stronger 
in numbers, a little more firmly rooted, throughout the California mis- 
sion at the present time, than we were six months ago. There are a 
few more branches in the mission; there are a few more Mutual Im- 
provement organizations ; there are a few more Sunday schools ; there 
are a few more Relief Societies ; and there are a few more Primary 
associations in the mission than were there at our last general con- 
ference. We feel encouraged in the work that has been entrusted into 
our hands- I am glad to say that we are a united band of men and 
women. There is no ill feeling in the ranks of the missionaries ; they 
are all earnest and active and willing to play their part, ready to respond 
to any demand that is made upon them to go and come as they may 
be directed by proper authority, and they are giving the very best that 
is in them to establish the work of God and to spread the message 
of truth among the people with whom they are brought in contact. 
They are not mighty men. They are not wonderful or strong men, 
but they are just the kind of men and women spoken of in the holy 
scriptures, when the inspired apostle made the declaration : "For ye see 
your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not 
many mighty, not many noble, are called : But God hath chosen the 
foolish things of the world to confound the wise." We feel that we 
are thus called- 

The missionaries feel that they need the help of Almighty God, and 
I think it is a good thing to have that feeling, to realize that they have 
been called to a labor that requires greater qualifications, greater power 
than men and women are possessed of naturally. The missionaries 
have that feeling, and yet it is wonderful the labor they perform, the 
zeal they manifest, the faith they develop as they labor in striving to 
preach the gospel of the Redeemer of the world. For they do make 
the discovery that they are in very deed the servants of God, and we 
try to impress that upon their minds. I believe devoutly in the doctrine 
that has been advocated during this conference, that is, that the Lord 
God of heaven has promised that there will be great things follow the 
testimony of his servants ; that after they have delivered their testimony 
to the inhabitants of the earth that testimony shall be backed up by 
the Lord God of heaven, with the vivid lightnings, with the thunders 
of heaven, with the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds, until all things 
shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them with fear because 



Elder Joseph w. McMurrin 139 

of the things that will come upon the inhabitants of the earth. I believe 
it, my brethren and sisters, and I try according to my power and 
ability to impress upon the missionaries that they are in very truth the 
servants of the Lord our God, and that they have been clothed with 
authority from on high, that whether men recognize and respect that 
authority or not, the Lord God is conscious that he has called them to 
his ministry, and I believe with all my soul that he will magnify them, 
maintain them in their service, and that he will finally bring to pass 
all that he has spoken by the mouths of holy prophets in relation to the 
latter times. 

I hope the men of Israel who are before me feel the responsibility 
that rests upon them in connection with the delivering of the gospel 
message to the inhabitants of the earth. For if God has spoken the 
truth, and we know he speaks only the truth, the world is famishing for 
the truth and power which brings salvation to the inhabitants of the 
earth. Men who have received this divine authority by the coming of 
holy angels, who brought back to mortal men the power and authority 
that had been lost from the inhabitants of the earth, owe something to 
the children of men. I hope that this call, which has been made again 
during this conference for men of experience to go abroad in the 
preaching of the gospel, will meet with a hearty response, that each man 
will feel that it means me, and not think it is my neighbor, and that all 
who hold the Priesthood will be anxious to play their part. 

I feel that I am under obligation to lift up my voice in proclamation 
of these principles that have been revealed, for in the mercy and 
providences of God some man found my own parents, and other mem- 
bers of the MjcMurrin family, in far-off Scotland, and through their 
teachings and testimonies and the help of God they were brought to 
believe the truth and came to this land; and in this land, the land of 
Zion, I was given birth. I praise God for that. I want to render to 
my fellowmen in some degree some such service as has been rendered 
to my own people. I am under obligation to make proclamation of the 
gospel, and every one of you is under obligation to play your part. 
He that is warned shall warn his neighbor, is the commandment of 
God in the revelations that have been given in our own time- Let us 
believe the scriptures. "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for 
whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap. For he that soweth 
to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to 
the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be 
weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." 

When I look into the faces of my companion mission presidents, 
I feel that it would be presumptuous on my part to take more of this 
precious time. I glory in -my membership in the Church of Christ. 
I have proved" to my own full satisfaction that it is the Church of 
Christ. "My doctrine," said the Redeemer, and that was all the 
Sons of God could say— "my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." 

I have tested that promise and doctrine, and I have had made 
manifest to me that this man who has been spoken of, Joseph Smith, 
was raised up by the Lord our God to reintroduce among men the 
doctrines of the everlasting gospel. It has brought joy unspeakable to 
my soul. In like manner, in fulfilment of the promise made in the 
closing declaration of the Book of Mormon, I have had made manifest 
to me, not through my father, not through any president or bishop, or 
apostle, but by the power of the Holy Ghost, that the Book of Mormon 
is the word of God, and I hope every man and woman in this congre- 
gation has that same knowledge, that same understanding, that it is a 
true, wonderful, glorious record of the ancient inhabitants of the land. 

God help us to stand for the truth, and not to be led away by the 
whims and doctrines of men that would blind us and rob us of our 
salvation, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen- 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We would like to hear from .many of our brethren. We will ask 
Brother Richard C. May to be our first speaker, and Brother Elmer F. 
Taylor to follow him. These are the only brethren presiding over stakes 
who have not either prayed or spoken in conference since 1919, except 
those who have been appointed during this year. Following these 
brethren we would like to hear from Brother J. Wyley Sessions, who 
has returned from South Africa. Brother O. B. Peterson, who has 
returned from Tahiti ; Brother Mark V. Coombs, from Tonga ; Eugene 
J. Neff, from the Hawaiian Islands, and Russell H. Blood from the 
French mission. 

ELDER RICHARD C. MAY 

President of the Minidoka Stake 

Brethren and sisters : I wish to extend the love and sympathy and 
good fellowship of the people of the Minidoka stake to the presidency 
and all the general authorities and all the people of this Church. This 
is an experience that I have never before had. I remember many years 
ago, when just a mere boy, of sitting in a little country meeting house 
and school house combined on a Sunday when the home missionaries 
came to the ward. And as those brethren sat up on the stand and in their 
turn talked to us, I thought to myself, what wonderful looking men. 
I wonder if that opportunity will ever come to me. And from that 
time to this present moment I have tried to do my duty in the Church, 
have tried to help to build up the kingdom of the Lord to the best of 
my ability, and I thank him from the depths of my heart for the 
opportunities that have come to me in helping to carry on this work. 
I thank him that I was born of goodly parents, and I thank him that in 
the home of my parents I have the first time to hear either of them 



ELDER RICHARD C. MAY 



141 



speak disparagingly of any of the authorities of this Church, and that 
teaching has been inculcated into my system until I would be afraid 
to raise my voice in criticism of any of these, the Lord's anointed. I 
hope and trust that while I sojourn in the earth I shall be privileged 
to do the best I can in bringing souls unto Christ and helping to build 
up his kingdom here in this earth, and I will give to him the praise and 
the honor and glory, forever and ever. Amen. 

ELDER ELMER F. TAYLOR 

President of the Young Stake, in Colorado and New Mexico 

My brethren and sisters: I have enjoyed this conference, all but 
one thing, and that is I have had a dread and fear that I might be called 
to this stand, and up to the present time I have managed to avoid meet- 
ing the President of the Church. I wanted to take a back seat, so 
to speak. But I am not ashamed, my brethren and sisters, to stand 
up and bear my testimony. I am glad to be here. I have never enjoyed 
myself before in my life like I have done during the sessions of this 
great conference. This is my first experience in this pulpit and I have 
only been in this building about six times in my life. My father drove 
the second wagon that came into this valley and told me the story of the 
pioneers, and I have a love for this country, for this state, and when 
I crossed the line into Utah, I said in my heart, "God bless Utah." 
That is the way I feel in regard to this part of the country, this part of 
the Lord's vineyard. But I have been down on the San Juan river 
almost forty years of my life. We are having a struggle down there, 
but there is no better land in the United States than we have in that part 
of the country. We do not need any money, but we need about a 
thousand more good, faithful Latter-day Saints who are not afraid of 
work to build up that country. 

I want to say a word or two in regard to the picture that I now 
see before me, that I have been viewing this afternoon. Not having 
had a chance before to go before the general authorities of the Church 
and speak to the twenty-six men who stand at the head of this great 
organization, I say to all who v are here today, and all who are listening 
in, that in my judgment, and it is my faith, they are the best men upon 
the face of the earth. As I said to a friend of mine some time ago, 
we are not naturally better than the people of the world, but the Church 
that we are members of, and the kind of work that we are engaged in, 
are the making of . us, and will make of us the best people upon the earth. 
I thank the Lord for having the opportunity of having had as guests 
in my home the men who represent the presidency of the Church, who 
come down from time to time to visit with us in our conferences. We 
welcome them there, and all the members of the General Boards. 

I do not desire to take any more of this precious time, but I thank 
the Lord for the privilege of speaking to you today, and do so in the 
worthy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Sessions presided in South Africa for six years, and 
labored about a year trying to get there. 

ELDER J. WYLEY SESSIONS 

Former President of the South African Mission 

Trembling though I am, laboring with only half a voice, feeling as 
humble as |I ever have felt in my life, yet my heart is filled with 
gratitude for the privilege of bringing to you, my brethren and sisters, 
the greeting of your brethren and sisters from the most distant branch 
of the Church on this great globe. As I bear my testimony to you, I 
desire to bear the testimony and represent the saints of that goodly 
land of South Africa. They have never seen a member of the general 
authorities of the Church. In our mission we have never been blessed 
with the presence of one of these men, but time after time I have heard 
those people in that land arise to their feet and bear witness that they 
know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that they know that 
President Grant is a prophet of God, and I am authorized by them to 
bring that message to you. 

Brethren and sisters, how we have longed to see you here and to 
meet with the Saints in these general conferences, but we were too far 
removed. I want to say to you that fourteen to fifteen thousand miles 
separated from you was not a great enough distance to separate us from 
the same good spirit that has prevailed during this conference, and as 
the general conferences have been held every year about this time, we 
arranged so that some of the conferences in the mission would be held 
at the same time as you are holding the general conferences here. I 
have felt time and time again that the Lord was blessing us with the 
same spirit that you have here. 

I would like to say one thing to the fathers and mothers who have 
sent sons to Africa, and those who have them there now, and those 
perhaps who will have sons go there. South Africa is not the country 
that was described by Theodore Roosevelt on his hunting expeditions. 
We saw no jungles ; we saw no wild animals ; we were not eaten up by 
cannibals, nor injured by them. The Union of South Africa is a modern, 
thoroughly up-to-date government. We do not move quite so fast 
there, and we do not live at quite the same tension you do here, but it is 
a fine, up-to-date country, and there we have a host of friends. Oh. 
brethren and sisters, if you could only realize and understand how those 
people really appreciate your humble boys. If you knew how their 
hearts swell with gratitude to you, and their prayers go up in your 
behalf for the sacrifice that you are making to send your sons there, 
and that it may not be too great a sacrifice for you—if you knew all 
those things I am sure you would respond more readily than you do. 
How we need help down there ! There are thousands and thousands of 



ELDER J. IVY LEY SESSIONS 



143 



good people in that land who need the gospel. There are lots of 
hardships. We often hear of the terrible financial condition of the 
European countries, and of those in other parts of the world # but it seems 
to me as I have traveled about in Africa and in Europe that the greatest 
starvation is for these precious truths that we have right here, which, 
as President McMurrin said, we are enjoying because somebody's son 
or somebody's daughter went into the mission field and somebody 
supported them. 

My brethren and sisters, let us respond to these things, and when 
your sons are called to South Africa — I know full well the expense 
is great — let us send them there, let us go without some motor 
car, or the last model at least, for I have seen so many motor 
cars that I do not think any of us need to go without them here. But 
let us go without the last model in order that we may send our sons 
to South Africa and to the other missions. The Lord has sent a very 
choice man down to that country to preside now. I know your boys 
will be protected and cared for, and they will return a blessing 
to you, and be a blessing to that land. I have heard you pray that the 
Lord might hasten the day when his purposes shall be consummated, 
yet here we sit sometimes and we are not helping the Lord in con- 
summating his purposes. 

As I have looked into the faces of the people in the congregations 
of the Saints in Africa and Europe where I. have been, I have almost 
felt to pray, Lord, stay the time until we shall have called to us these 
people who are here standing in darkness, not realizing how completely 
they need the gospel, not knowing its value and its blessings. And yet 
there are just as good hearts burning in their bosoms, longing for and 
needing the gospel, and we stand charged by the Lord God of heaven 
to deliver that message, and I hope and pray that as long as I live 
I shall not get away from the choice spirit that attends the missionaries. 
I want the missionary spirit disseminated through the wards and stakes 
of Zion, and my humble prayer is that the Lord will fill us all with a 
desire to deliver this great message to the people who need it so 
much, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Brother O. B. Peterson spent three and a half years in the 
Tahitian Mission upon his first mission and presided there for three 
years on his second mission. 

ELDER O. B. PETERSON 

Former President of the Tahitian Mission 

We have heard the scripture quoted to us this afternoon, my 
brethren and sisters, to the effect that it is the weak things of the 
earth that are called. I feel that is particularly applicable to me at 
this time. To say the least, however, it proves to me that the 1 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



oft-heard statement, that opportunity comes but once to every man, 
is not correct. I remember that my name was called out at our 
last general conference, but, owing to the fact that I was not 
properly informed as to my privileges in connection with my work, 
I stayed on the job and consequently was not present. I felt, how- 
ever, that I would have another chance; not that I have anything 
special to say, but I deem it an honor to stand in so renowned a place, 
for here have stood the prophets and apostles and servants of God 
in the dispensation of the fulness of times; and to me at least, if 
there is any difference among them, they are just a little more than any 
of the prophets and apostles of the Lord in any previous dispensa- ' 
tion. It is my testimony that they have the same authority, the 
same priesthood and the same office and calling; that they are 
inspired by the same spirit ; and, in addition to that, they are the 
ones who are called to lead, counsel and instruct us. The others are 
just a matter of history. 

My lot as a missionary was cast among the more humble peo- 
ple of our Father's children ; but a more loving people, a more 
lovable people and a more hospitable people you could not find in 
any other place throughout the world. We often wortder how it 
is that our young people can leave their homes and loved ones 
here in the valleys of the mountains and go out into the various 
parts of the world, to people with habits and customs so absolutely 
different to those to which they have been accustomed, and to an 
environment altogether at variance with anything they had known 
before; compelled to learn languages that seem at first to have no 
meaning whatsoever; yet, in a remarkably short time, they are able 
to apply themselves in work ; they are able to adapt themselves 
to the peculiarities of the people ; they soon learn the languages, 
and are able to be really instrumental in the hands of the Lord in 
spreading the gospel among his children. It is my testimony that 
the reason for this is the spirit of service that dwells within their 
hearts — it is the missionary spirit. 

The Tahitian Mission, wherein I had the pleasure of laboring, 
as has been said, for six and a half years, is somewhat different, 
I think, from most any other mission of- the Church ; but I can 
say it is just as good as any other mission in the world. Our' 
missionary work there, to a very large extent, demands that we 
travel upon the sea in small ships — twenty-five, thirty and forty- 
ton sailing vessels and gasoline schooners. Our mission covers a 
radius of more than a thousand miles, reaching from the island 
of Tubuai, which was the first island in the Pacific ocean to receive 
the gospel in this dispensation, to the Tuamotu archipelago in the 
north. Our branches are scattered over this thousand miles with 
a separation of from fifty or sixty miles to four hundred miles,, 
and we are compelled to travel from one island to another in order 
to meet with our Saints. Owing to the few missionaries we have 
and to the absolutely undependable means of travel, we are unable 
to maintain constant contact with them; and, naturally, they ret- 



ELDER O.B. PETERSON 



145 



rograde a little. But t'hey respond readily to the work of the mis- 
sionaries. 

One of our young men, who just recently returned from there, 
was laboring on the island of Tubuai. He had been for ten months 
Avithout any word from home. It had been six months since his 
folks had heard from him. Upon the arrival of President Alma 
G. Burton, he was called to headquarters with his companion; but 
it so happened that the ship on which they were to sail was con- 
demned by the government officials, precluding the taking of any 
passengers aboard. In order to get away, however, in response to 
the call of the mission president, they were compelled to resort 
to strategy ; and after the vessel had left the island and gotten about 
five miles at sea, these two young men got into a native canoe 
and were paddled five miles through the open sea in order to catch the 
boat and go to headquarters. That is just an example of some 
of the things we do in the Tahitian mission in the course of our 
gospel labors there. But I want to testify, my brethren and 
sisters, that the words of Nephi, wherein he said that the Lord 
does not require us to do anything except he provides a way, 
is manifested repeatedly there, and the protecting hand of the Lord 
has been over us ; and, in spite of the little dangers at times to 
which we are exposed, we never fear ; and,, in spite of the fact 
that the Tahitian mission was the first island mission opened in 
this dispensation, we have never had a missionary die in the serv- 
ice either from sickness or accident. 

I should just like to relate a little incident to show the extent 
to which the missionary spirit plays its part in our work. We 
had a young man who was of a rather backward disposition and it 
was very difficult for him to learn the language. For his good, 
we gave him a transfer to the California mission. He finished his 
mission there and received an honorable release a year ago this 
Fall. He paid us a visit on his way home, and last April during 
our general conference he called on us again. He said to me : 
"You know I have been back to California since my return home. 
Upon my arrival home last Fall," he continued, "I was dicontented 
and dissatisfied. It seemed that I had lost something valuable in 
my life. It seemed that the people at home were different, the 
work was different and I could not content myself. Conse- 
quently I determined to go back to California, where I had en- 
joyed myself so much." 

So, he went back to his mission field ; he traveled over the same 
ground which he was wont to travel as a missionary; he met the 
same people, but he confessed, "I was disappointed, I did not seem 
to find the same feeling and conditions that I experienced while 
laboring there as a missionary ; and I decided that the reason for 
it was, that the purpose for which I had gone the first time was 
for the sake of serving others in behalf of the gospel, and the sec- 
ond trip was for my own pleasure ; and I found that it makes a dif- 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ference." He said, "I determined to go home and apply the same 
spirit of service, the same missionary spirit, at home that I had 
applied in the mission field, and I am now contented. I find that 
the people at home are just as congenial, and friendly, and the 
work is just as interesting. 'The trouble was I had not applied 
myself in the spirit of service at home, as I had done in the mission 
field, and this, I learned, had been the cause of my supreme joy 
and happiness there." 

I think I have taken my share of the time, my brethren and 
sisters. I appreciate the privilege of standing here and bearing 
my testimony, and expressing these few thoughts. I have been 
buoyed up in my faith during the sessions of this conference ; and 
I pray that the Lord will bless all of us, that we might ever be firm 
and steadfast, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Brother Mark V. Coombs spent three and a half years in Samoa 
and six years in Tonga. 

ELDER MARK V. COOMBS 

Former President of the Tongan Mission 

I feel very timid, my brethren and sisters, in mingling my 
humble testimony with the wonderful testimonies that have been borne 
before me. For the few moments that I occupy this position, I do ask 
that my testimony might be prompted by the Spirit of the Lord, that 
I might be able to say something to you and put before you some of 
the problems with which we have been confronted in Tonga. 

While Brother Sessions says that South Africa is the most distant of 
the missions, I believe that Tonga is the most isolated. We think we 
are mighty lucky if we can get a letter home and a reply to that letter 
inside of five months, and we never get a letter any more than once 
a month. When our newspapers reach us they are so stale that the 
only items we read are the sermons that have been spoken from this 
stand, or other instructions by the presiding brethren. 

Now Tonga is only a small place. It is a tiny mission, possibly 
one of the smallest, and you have not heard much of Tonga. But 
there are some mighty good people there, people whom I have learned 
to love. The Tongan mission is situated about seven hundred miles 
eastward of Fiji; that is, about seven thousand miles from here, not 
"out where the West begins," but where the West ends. The sun rises 
first in Tonga, in 1922-23 we performed the first baptisms that were 
performed throughout the world in those years in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We got up in the morning and performed 
these baptisms in the east, for the sun rises first there. We are seventeen 
hours ahead of the time in Salt Lake City. 



ELDER MARK V. COOMBS

We have about fourteen inhabited islands with a population of 
about 25,000 people. If missionaries were sent according to our popu- 
lation we would have but few, but due to the scattered condition of the 
islands we feel that we ought to have between twelve and fourteen 
missionaries constantly in the field, but we do not get them, and we do 
not get them because it seems to me there is a certain feeling among 
the parents in Zion which causes them to discriminate against our 
island missions, particularly Tahiti, Samoa, and Tonga. They figure 
that those island missions are so far isolated and that there is no 
medical attention ; sanitary conditions are supposed to be poor, and 
these dear sons have to make so many sacrifices that they do not 
want t'hem to go there. They would prefer possibly that they go 
to Great Britain, to some of our American missions, or to Australia, 
and possibly, while they are doing missionary work, hunt up a 
little genealogy. That is all well and good, but it appears to me to 
be just a little bit selfish. It appears to me that it" should not make 
much difference where you give your service. The thing is, are you 
giving the service? t The souls of those Tongan people are just as 
valuable as the souls of our ancestors who have gone before us, just as 
precious in the eyes of the Lord as the souls of people who are of a 
different complexion. *I learned to love those people. I made a few 
sacrifices, which I do not count as sacrifices, but I count them privileges, 
and the people made many sacrifices for me. They went without food 
that I' might eat ; they took clothes from their own backs and gave 
them to me. They have given me their last horse. They have given me 
the last vegetables from their garden; when they had practically nothing, 
they saw to it that I and mine had plenty. So because of these close 
associations I have learned to love those people. And they did not 
only make those sacrifices for me, but they have made them for every 
elder who has been in the Tongan mission. 

It was my privilege to be in Tonga when Brother McKay visited us 
in 1921. At that time there were quarantine regulations existing and 
it did not appear that he could visit us, but the Saints were back of us, 
and we exercised our faith and prayers, and with a lot of coaxing on 
my part, we finally prevailed upon Brother McKay to stop over in 
Tonga. I went with him as far as Samoa and thoroughly enjoyed my 
visit there. While Brother McKay was there, mingling with those 
people, a beautiful spirit prevailed. And then it appeared that the 
Spirit was bound to call him from there and that he was not going to 
Tahiti or Tonga, neither he nor Brother Cannon. Finally, in one way 
or another, he sent Brother Cannon on to New Zealand and he remained 
with us in Tonga. I believe those few days that Brother McKay was 
in Tonga were the happiest days of my life. The Saints congregated 
there, not being able to understand one word he said, but understanding 
through the Spirit, and I want to assure you that many of our most 
stalwart converts were made after his visit in Tonga. The influence 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that sprang up in Tonga after Brother McKay was there is something 
that I cannot describe. It seemed that after his visit some of our 
problems began to melt away and we began to find a way to solve them 
and to deliver our message better to that people 

I had been there but ten months at that time. One of Brother 
McKay's first remarks to me was, as we walked down the street one 
day, "Well, Brother Coombs, I see you have not very many friends 
here," by which I understood he referred to the Europeans. So I set 
myself to the task right there of making more friends and winning my 
way into the hearts of the Europeans' in that nation, in order that we 
might present the gospel to them. We were blessed with some splendid 
elders. I' have often said that had President Grant given me the choice 
of all of the elders in Zion, I think I 1 could not have chosen better men 
than we had at that time, when we had to fight popular opinion in order 
to be able to prolong the life of the Tongan mission. In 1922, conditions 
got so warm and persecution so hot there that the government enacted 
a measure which prohibited the entrance of any more "Mormon" mis- 
sionaries into Tonga, at least the law read that no more "Mormons" 
could enter under a penalty of a five hundred dollar fine and possibly 
imprisonment and deportation at the end of the term of imprisonment. 
I went to the .Chief Justice and told him that it was not fair, and that 
it did not agree with their own constitution. He said, "Mr. Coombs, 
I happen not only to be the Chief Justice, but I am also the attorney. 
We do not want you 'Mormons' here." I said, "Why don't you want 
us here ?" "Well," he said, "that is not your business. We don't want 
you, that is all. You are undesirable citizens." After a little diplomacy 
and talk, I 1 found out why they did not want us. The one cry at 
Tonga at the present time is, one church. Tonga, you know, is the 
smallest government in the world that is not supporting a foreign 
parliament. They are not interfered with even by England. They 
were afraid that "Mormon" elders might stir up a spirit of disunion. 
They wanted every native there to belong to the Free Church or to 
the Wesleyan Church, and they were going to try to do away with all 
other religions, and their first gun was aimed at the "Mormons." We 
worked untiringly for two years, and at the end of that time I had the 
satisfaction of convincing those people that their viewpoint was wrong. 
We made numerous calls upon the Chief Justice and also upon the 
ministers and convinced them that their viewpoint was wrong, and by 
means of faith and prayer and our works we got them to repeal those 
measures in 1924. Now we can have all the elders that we can prevail 
upon the First Presidency and parents to send us in Tonga. And we 
need them. We need them badly, in fact. The people there need the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. They have been imposed upon, they have been 
exploited, and it seems to me the time has come that they should get 
the gospel in its simplicity and purity, and I count it a privilege to have 
labored among those people. I love them, and I am proud that I have 
associated with them. 



ELDER MARK V. COOMBS

Not long ago I had a little experience something like the one 
related by President Peterson, where we had to travel in our little 
sail boat of only nine tons, and I weathered a three days' hurricane to 
go to Vavau to conference with Brother Cahoon and his wife. Brother 
Cahoon is now the mission president down there. We were in sight of 
land with our sails ripped to pieces, and were buffeted by waves which 
were twenty or thirty feet high, and we could not make the harbor. 
The captain of that boat was one of our priesthood, a priest, and a 
splendid fellow, by the name of Jone Kogaika. I had told him that 
I had an appointment in Vavau for conference, and I was invited to 
go in his boat free of charge, and there were many others aboard the 
boat. During the time that we were buffeted about we were all sick. 
Our food was exhausted, our water was gone, and we had no means 
of getting into the harbor because our sails were ripped. I said to the 
captain, "Jone, let us turn around and go back to Haapai." I said, 
"Simply turn around and the wind will drive us back to Haapai, and 
we will get there in five or six hours and there we will be in perfect 
safety among those protecting reefs." He looked me square in the 
eye and said: "Didn't you tell me you had an appointment for con- 
ference next Sunday at Vavau." "That is what I told you, Jone." 
He shook his fist and said: "Well, the Lord being my helper, I will 
get you through." He got us through. We thought we were going 
down, and we didn't care if we did go down, we were so sick. I had 
had a wonderful blessing before going out there by President Penrose, 
and he promised me that I would go in safety on land and on sea. 
When things got so furious I forgot the blessing for the time being, 
and said to Jone that we should turn around and go back. But he 
had the faith I should have shown, and he got us through. 

Now that is only one instance. Another man, Pita Afu, while 
I was visiting Tonga in 1914, a high chief, or one who should have 
been a high chief, (he had not yet been appointed a high chief) accepted 
the gospel, and invited the elders to establish the work in his 
village. The king of Tonga, hearing about it, became quite in- 
censed, and made a special trip up to Vavau to interview Pita, and 
said to him, "What is this I hear about you ? Why are you associated 
with those 'Mormons,' such an unpopular sect ? I' wish you would 
leave them alone." He took Pita upon a high eminence where he could 
overlook the beautiful harbor of Vavau and all the lower islands, and 
pointedvto them and said: "Pita, if you will renounce 'Mormonism,' 
I will make you a present of all of these islands down here for your 
inheritance, for your sons who follow after you." Pita looked him 
square in the eye and said : "With all due respect to your majesty, 
you have not enough land in all Tonga to induce me to leave the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

Now these are only a few testimonies, only two instances showing 
the kind of people among whom your sons are laboring. They are 
blessed and favored when they receive a call to go to that land.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Tonga is not the best mission of the Church, but there is none better. 
Every elder who returns home contends that his mission is the best, and 
so it is. If it were not, then that elder was not doing his duty. It 
was a pleasure to me to get a letter not so long ago from Brother 
Widtsoe, who had heard one of our missionaries make his report, and 
he said something like this in referring to this young elder's testi- 
mony: "His testimony rang as true and clear as the tone of a silver 
bell, Brother Coombs. I am sure that the Tongan mission is not only 
doing its full duty to the Saints there, 'but it is developing to a full 
degree the elders who are laboring there." And the same holds true of 
those other islands which are discriminated against by the mothers 
and fathers. They develop to a full extent the elders who are laboring 
there. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I know that God lives. I support these 
brethren whom we have lifted our hands to support, our presiding 
brethren, in the offices they hold. The gospel is dear to me, and I' am 
looking forward to the time when I might be favored with another 
call to go down among the people of those south seas, for I am still 
quite young — whether t to Tonga, or to Samoa, or anywhere, it matters 
not, for I love those Lamanitish people. 

;Just one more word about our Tongan mission. Possibly our 
brethren from New Zealand think the New Zealand school, the Maori 
Agricultural College is not supported by the other missions. But Tonga 
is supporting the Maori Agricultural College at Hastings, New Zealand. 
At the present time I think we have about fourteen or fifteen of our 
young men down there in New Zealand attending that college. Another 
thing, the captain of the classes and the class leaders are Tongan boys, 
and since our Tongan boys have gone there the leaders of that college 
and the graduates who have graduated with honors have been Tongans 
every time. So you see the Tongans are a bright people and they 
have good souls worth saving. 

May God bless you, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

Brother McKay suggested that I tell you how far those boys 
travel to get to that school. Tonga is only 1800 miles from New 
Zealand. These boys go down to school at their own expense and 
earn their own way while they are there and pay their own expenses 
back. Two of them have recently graduated with honors and they are 
teaching in our schools in Tonga. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Brother Eugene Neff spent several years in the Hawaiian Islands 
on his first mission, and presided, as I remember it, for somewhat 
over three years on his second mission. He doesn't appear to be present. 
Brother Blood, I believe, is at the University of Utah. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, that the time is short and 
very precious this afternoon. I rejoice with you in the testimonies and 
instructions that we have received in this conference, because they are 
true and are for the welfare of all the people of the Church, and for all 
mankind. I rejoice in the fact that we are living in the dispensation which 
has been spoken about frequently in the sessions of this conference — 
the dispensation of the fulness of times, the last great dispensation of 
the gospel which the Lord has to give. This dispensation has been 
looked forward to in the past. The Apostle Paul foretold this time 
when the Lord should gather together in Christ all things that are in 
heaven and in the earth. It is the time preparatory to the coming 
again of the Savior — the Lord Jesus Christ — to reign this time upon 
the earth in peace and in glory. He came nineteen hundred years 
ago in humility and sorrow to accomplish the atoning work that was 
before him to do. 

History repeats itself, we are told, i't appears to me that there 
is a comparison between the dispensation of the meridian of time and 
this dispensation, in the sense that as the Savior had to have a fore- 
runner at that time in the person of John the Baptist to prepare the 
way for his coming, in this dispensation there has come a forerunner; 
not one who should be able to prepare the way directly for the Savior 
and to see him upon the earth, but one who should prepare the way 
in the establishment of this dispensation, that the work might "grow 
and the purposes of the Lord be accomplished in preparation for his 
great coming, when he shall come to reign during a thousand years. 
I rejoice that there has been restored in this dispensation that divine 
authority which the Prophet Joseph Smith received — that authority 
which had been lost from the earth for many hundred years. After 
the dispensation of the meridian of time, with the work which the 
apostles had carried on, the men and women who had accepted the 
gospel gradually apostatized from the truth, and the authority was lost, 
As the Prophet Isaiah declared, "The earth also is defiled under the in- 
habitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the 
ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant." 

That was the condition which prevailed for centuries during the 
dark ages ; and then came the beginning of the dawn during the 
renaissance and the reformation. Men began to look forward to a 
greater time when truth and the fulness of the gospel should come to 
the earth. I am reminded of a statement made about the year 1600 
by a man who was the leader among the Puritans who came to 
America. It is said that John Robinson, the pastor of the pilgrims, an 
old man of great vision and piety, who was left behind when the 
pilgrims sailed for America, charged them when they left Holland, 
"If God reveal anything to us by any other instrument of his, be as 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ready to receive it as ever we were to receive any truth by his ministry," 
for he was very confident that the Lord had more truth and light yet 
to bring forth out of his holy word. 

There were many such people who were looking forward to the time 
when the fulness of truth should be restored. And so when the gospel 
came and missionaries were sent out to various parts of the world, 
there were, such as in England, communities or congregations of people 
who were prepared to receive the truth in its fulness. I' rejoice in the 
fact that this divine authority, the Priesthood of the Son of God, has 
been restored ; whereby every man who is prepared and is worthy, who 
seeks to live in accordance with the principles of the gospel, may have 
the privilege of receiving this power and of laboring for the welfare 
of the Church, for the spread of the gospel, for the bringing together 
of all things in Christ, and for the accomplishment of his purposes. 

I rejoice that we are possessed of this truth with regard to divine 
authority — which is very different from that which is called priesthood 
or ministry in the world — that the Lord has given to us opportunity 
whereby all men, as was the case in the previous dispensation, might 
be commissioned to labor for the welfare of others. I rejoice in the 
fact that from the time of the organization of this Church the leaders 
who have had the responsibility as watchmen upon the towers have 
declared the words and the will of the Lord and have warned the 
people, and that warning has been carried from them to others who bear 
the Priesthood, and through them to others, who have direct watchcare 
in the wards and branches ; and thereby the people have been built up 
and strengthened and enabled to resist evil and temptation. If all 
the world would accept these truths, if all the world would accept the 
warnings with regard to the evils which do and which shall exist, and 
would accept wisdom and be willing to receive and to follow these 
instructions through the light that comes to them or that can come to 
them, the world would be very much better for it, and the time would 
be ripe muc'h sooner for the coming of the Son of man. 

The Lord can give unto us light only as we will receive it. Only as 
we open the windows and doors of our houses can the sunlight enter in 
and cleanse and strengthen and bring life and light to that house and 
overcome unhealthfulness. And so only as we open the windows and 
doors of our souls to the holy Spirit can truth enter in and strengthen 
and develop us and make us more healthy spiritually. This is the 
message which the authorities of this Church have had and have today 
to bring to the people everywhere, not only to the Latter-day Saints; 
primarily, of course, to them, but to all mankind : That if they will 
resist and overcome evil and temptation, if they will accept and obey 
this gospel, they shall grow in the knowledge of the truth, they shall 
develop those qualities that will make them better men and women, 
they shall increase in the spirit of love for their fellowmen, they 
shall enjoy true happiness, and be prepared to meet the Lord. 

I pray that the Lord will help every one of us to sense our oppor- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



153 



tunities and to listen and render obedience to the instructions that come 
to us. They are for our welfare, not for the welfare of any other 
human being, but for us individually. Every commandment of the' 
Lord is for our development and progress and growth. The Lord will 
hasten the time when we shall promote and develop the spirit whereby 
we shall be able to live as of one heart and of one mind. May that 
time soon come and may we cultivate unity and love and peace and 
joy, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo, "My Redeemer and my Lord," was sung by Mrs. Joseph 
Haycock.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

THE LABORS OF PRESIDENT JAMES E. TALMAGE 

I wish to say that we hear from time to time very favorable reports 
regarding the work being accomplished by Brother James E. Talmage 
as president of the European mission, and also as president of the Brit- 
ish mission. He has succeeded in getting many communications into the 
papers in Great Britain, setting forth the faith of the Latter-day Saints, 
and he is accomplishing a very remarkable and splendid work while 
presiding in that far-off land. He has the constant faith and prayers 
of the Presidency, Apostles and Presiding Patriarch in their weekly 
meetings in the temple. 

THE SAINTS REQUESTED TO APPLY SCRIPTURE 

I desire to read the words of the Savior, which I would like the 
Latter-day Saints to apply to the teachings of the servants of the Lord 
who constitute -the authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ, and who 
are promulgating his teachings and his sayings and calling people to 
repentance. I feel that these words should find lodgment in the 'hearts 
of those who have listened to the wonderful testimonies that have been 
borne : 

"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I 
will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock : 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock. 

"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 

"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon the house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it." 

A BLESSING FOR PRIESTHOOD AND AUXILIARY WORKERS AND THE SAINTS 

I desire to extend 'my blessing to all the men and the women jwho 
preside in all the stakes of Zion throughout the Church, in all the mis- 
sions, in all the wards, in all the quorums of the priesthood and in all 
the auxiliary organizations. I am convinced beyond the shadow of a 
doubt that there cannot be found in any part of the world men and 
women giving so unselfishly of their time, of their talents, and of the 
best that is in them, for the salvation of the souls of men. I am sat- 
isfied that there are no other people who are devoting so much of their 
time, of their money, of their thoughts, and of their very being for the 
advancement of God's work at home and abroad, as are the Latter-day 
Saints. And with all the power that God has given me, I desire to bless 
the men and the women who are thus giving their time and thought 
and are setting examples that are worthy of the imitation, not only 
of those over whom they preside, but of all men. Every man and woman 
who is laboring for the salvation of the souls of men and keeping the 
commandments of God is entitled to be blessed, and I pray God that his 
blessings may come to them. 

I rejoice in the remarkable and splendid testimonies that have been 
borne, during our conference, under the inspiration and by the light 
and power of God, and I pray that these testimonies may find lodgment 
in the hearts of the people, and that they will remember that those who 
obey the (Lord and keep his commandments are building their house 
upon a rock, and those who fail to do this are building their house upon 
the sand. 

May the God of heaven bless us and be and abide with us until we 
meet again in six months from now in general conference, is my 
prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemed and 
Savior. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "The .time is iar spent," and the bene- 
diction was pronounced by Elder E. Frank Birch, president of the 
Tintic stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned for six months. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by 
B. Cecil Gates ; accompaniments and interludes on the great organ 
were played by Edward P. Kimball, Tracy Y. Cannon, Alexander 
Schreiner and Frank W. Asper. Stenographic reports were made in 
the Tabernacle by Frank W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson, 
and in the Assembly Hall by Frederick G. Barker.

"Restoration of the Gospel" 

By OSBORNE J. P. WIDTSOE 

"This book prepared by Elder Osborne J. P. Widtsoe, dealing with 
the important subject of the Restoration of the everlasting Gospel, 
should be read and its contents carefully considered by those who are 
seeking after truth. It treats the Restoration clearly, and places before 
the people many things that have not been generally considered here- 
tofore. It will be a means of strengthening the faith of the youth of 
Israel and will impart information that is invaluable. May the spirit 
of truth accompany the work and rest upon all those who diligently 
read it with a desire to learn of and profit by the Restoration of the 

Gospel! " Joseph F. Smith, Jr.

S WHAT DID JOSEPH SMITH KNOW ABOUT SCIENCE? 



Read: 



Joseph Smith as Scientist 

By JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

"In the life of every person, who receives a higher education, in or 
out of schools, there is a time when there seems to be opposition be- 
tween science and religion; between man-made and God-made knowl- 
edge. The struggle for reconciliation between the contending forces 
is not an easy one. It cuts deep into the soul and usually leaves scars 
that ache while life endures. There are thousands of young people in 
the Church today, and hundreds of thousands throughout the world, who 
are struggling to set themselves right with the God above and the world 
about them. It is for these young people, primarily, that this book has 
been written."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and their counselors, and numerous other prominent officers represent- 
ing the quorums of the Priesthood, also general, stake, and ward officers 
of the auxiliary organizations of the Church. 

Mission Presidents as follows were in attendance: B. H. Roberts, 
Eastern States ; John H. Taylor, Northern States ; Samuel O. Bennion, 
Central States; Charles A. Callis, Southern States; John M. Knight, 
Western States; Joseph W. McMurrin, California; Brigham S. Young,

The Tabernacle was filled to capacity and numbers were standing 
in the side aisles of the main floor and in the galleries. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Elder Adam S. Bennion, superintendent of Church schools, offered 
the opening prayer. 

A sacred solo, "Open the Temple Gates," was sung by Jessie 
Evans. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice again at having the opportunity of meeting with the Saints 
in General Conference. It is a very inspiring sight to see this large 
Tabernacle filled to overflowing, and people standing, at the first 
session. 

THE RADIO 

The exercises of today and throughout the conference are to be 
broadcasted; and it is estimated that in the neighborhood of a million 
people will be able to hear all that is said, provided they are listening 
in during the conference sessions. The radio is one of the most mar- 
velous inventions man knows anything about. To have the voice 
carried for thousands of miles seems almost beyond comprehension. 

LET US SERVE GOD WITH ALL MIGHT, MIND AND STRENGTH 

I rejoice in the remarkable and wonderful growth of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ in our day. Over a year before the Church 
was organized a short revelation was given through the Prophet 
Joseph, directed to his father. It reads as follows : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children 
of men. 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the serivce of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless 
before God at the last day. 

"Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work; 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in 
his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but 
bringeth salvation to his soul; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 3 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." , 

If there is any one thing more than another that I desire to im- 
press upon the hearts of the Latter-day Saints it is that we should in 
very deed serve God with all our might, mind and strength, that we 
may keep pace with the progress of his work here upon the earth. 
This very audience here today, the immense auditorium filled to over- 
flowing, testifies more eloquently than any language of mine regard- 
ing the growth of the Church of Jesus Christ. When I recall the 
revelations that were given to the Prophet Joseph prior to the organ- 
ization of the Church foretelling the growth and the accomplish- 
ments of the work of God here upon the earth, it is one of many 
testimonies to me regarding the divinity of this work in which you and 
I are engaged. 

OUTSTANDING EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE CHURCH 
IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS 

I believe the Saints will be interested in knowing something of 
the progress in various ways that has taken place in the Church since 
we last assembled here. Within a few weeks after the April con- 
ference it fell to my lot to go East and to hold meetings in Denver, 
of the Western States mission, in Independence, Kansas City and St. 
Louis of the Central States mission, and later to visit Omaha in the 
Western States mission. I had the privilege of speaking in all of 
these places. Also meeting with and instructing our elders. I found 
a wonderful spirit of loyalty on the part of the Mission presidents, of 
the elders, and of the lady missionaries in all of these places. I re- 
joiced exceedingly in visiting with them. I came in contact with a 
number of influential men, some of whom attended our services. Sev- 
eral of them afterward expressed their pleasure in having heard some- 
thing regarding our faith that was new to them. The great majority of 
mankind pay little or no attention to the message of the Latter-day 
Saints, but many pay a great deal of attention to the things of a detri- 
mental character that are published against us. Today men of intelli- 
gence, men of thought, and men who are studying, in seeing the won- 
derful progress of the work of God here on the earth, are beginning to 
realize that there must be something good in it, considering the class 
of people that are attracted to it. 

I had the pleasure of playing a game of golf in Kansas City, 
and learned that the title to part of the very ground upon which we 
were playing originally stood in the name of the Bishop of the "Mor- 
mon" Church. I also learned that a large proportion of Kansas City 
stands upon ground once owned by the Latter-day Saints. The title

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to much of it has never passed, and the only title people today have to 
a portion of that great city is by possessing the ground. In tracing the 
abstracts back they find that the title originally was in the name of 
the Bishop of the "Mormon" Church. We all remember with gratitude 
the wonderful courage and manhood of General Doniphan in sav- 
ing the life of the Prophet Joseph. Part of our holdings in that sec- 
tion of the country — thousands of acres, as I remember it — was turned 
over to Doniphan as a fee for legal services. The price of those lands 
then was very insignificant, but I was assured that the very land 
turned over to General Doniphan is today worth more than ten mil- 
lions of dollars. 

After returning from visiting the Western and the Central States 
missions, in June, I went East and visited the Northern States mission, 
the Canadian mission and the Eastern States mission. I had the priv- 
ilege for the first time of visiting Montreal, in Canada, and of attend- 
ing one of the sessions of the Rotary Club in Toronto. The work in 
all of the missions I have visited since the last conference is pro- 
gressing in a splendid way. 

Since our last conference, President Anthony W. Ivins and Elder 
Richard R. Lyman have visited the Hawaiian Islands with members 
of their families. The work there is progressing splendidly. Our 
sugar plantations there are progressing more satisfactorily at the 
present time than for many years past. 

New chapels are being erected in many of our missions. A site 
for a new chapel has been purchased on one of the principal streets 
in Washington, D. C, and we expect to erect a place of worship there 
that will be a credit to the Latter-day Saints, and worthy of that city 
of beautiful churches, wonderful public buildings, and palatial resi- 
dences. We hope to have a building there that will be as much of a 
credit to us at Washington as our magnificent office building is to 
us here — not as expensive, of course, but in every respect worthy of 
the Church of Christ. 

Brother James E. Talmage has been chosen to preside over the 
European mission. Elder David O. McKay will have been in that 
mission two years by the time he leaves it. Previous to his being 
called there, he and Brother Hugh J. Cannon spent a year in traveling 
around the world, visiting nearly all of the missions in the world. 
Therefore we felt it was only fair to him to allow him to return to 
his mountain home without staying the usual three years that the 
brethren spend in England. 

We have sent considerable sums of money to the Norwegian and Danish 
missions for final payment on meetinghouses purchased years ago. We have 
purchased a fine large meetinghouse at Rotterdam. There has been erected a 
splendid meetinghouse at Honolulu ; and others are now authorized in the 
Hawaiian Islands. We have secured a long lease of farming lands for the 
Tongan mission, not being able to purchase and get title there. 

The baptisms in the missions during the past six months number 3,156, a 
very decided increase over the average in years past. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Two new stakes have been organized since our last conference, namely, the 
Grant stake, taken from the Granite stake, and the Minidoka stake, a part of 
the Blaine stake. 

Twelve new wards have been organized during the past six months. 

A large number of new meeting houses are being erected in Zion. I 
believe more building is going on at the present time in the various stakes of 
Zion than for many years past. 

We have ordered a monument to be erected at the grave of Martin Harris, 
in Clarkston, Utah. 

A new home is being provided for the Lamanites located near Cedar City, 
in order that they may be more comfortably situated. 

Successful conventions of auxiliary organizations are in progress at the 
present time all over the Church. 

Quite a number of seminary buildings have been erected by the Saints in 
various parts of the Church. 

There is a large and increased attendance at the Brigham Young University 
and our other Church schools. 

A very remarkable increase is noted in the attendance at all of our temples. 
The Manti temple has been overhauled, and extensive repairs made there, making 
it very much more comfortable and convenient than in the past. The repairs 
being made at the Salt Lake temple are now all completed. Rapid progress 
is being made in the erection of the Arizona temple. 

We have decided to erect on this block a monument in honor of 
the Three Witnesses (perhaps we will include the Eight Witnesses), 
to be located in the rear of the statues of Presidents Joseph and Hyrum 
Smith. The design has not yet been decided upon ; but we will endeavor 
to have something that will be as attractive and as creditable, and that 
will preach the wonderful message proclaimed in the Book of Mormon 
as effectively as the Sea Gull Monument preaches the wonderful 
deliverance wrought by the Lord in the days when the crickets threat- 
ened to destroy everything. Undoubtedly some of the inspirational 
passages of the Book of Mormon, also the fact that these three wit- 
nesses declare that an angel of God came down from heaven and laid 
before their eyes, that they beheld and saw the plates of the Book 
of Mormon, and the engravings thereon, and that the voice of the 
Lord commanded them that they should bear record of it, with other 
incidents that proclaim the divinity of the Book of Mormon, will be 
features of the monument. 

We are pleased to note that there is an improvement in the sup- 
port of our foreign newspapers. There are many faithful, diligent 
Latter-day Saints who, having embraced the Gospel in foreign lands 
at an advanced age, cannot read the English language, and it is a great 
comfort and blessing to them to have some of the sermons, messages, 
and news, regarding the work of God published in their own language. 
We bespeak for these papers the loyal patronage of those of foreign 
birth. Young men who have prospered here in the things of this 
world should be willing to assist in circulating at home and abroad 
the word of God through the papers published in the mother tongue 
of their parents. 

We have been called upon during the past six months to part with

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



one of our loyal stake presidents, — President Andrew Kimball. It 
fell to my lot to have the privilege of going- to Thatcher, Arizona, and 
attending the funeral, at which there was a wonderful outpouring of the 
people, showing their respect and love for their president. It was a 
source of satisfaction to me to have the opportunity of paying a tribute 
of love and respect to him at the services. 

We have to announce the death of Sister Elizabeth C. McCune, 
who, in connection with her husband, presented to the Church some 
years ago the magnificent McCune mansion on upper Main street, 
the name of which has been changed since the death of Sister McCune 
to The McCune School of Music and Art. We hope at no far distant 
date to have a portion of that building devoted to the fine arts in the 
form of beautiful paintings and sculpture. There are two magnificent 
pieces of sculpture there now, probably the finest in our state, which 
were presented with the mansion at the time it was given to us. 

I believe this covers the activities of the past six months that I 
thought would be of interest to the people. Of course, you will realize 
that if I were to enter into detail regarding these activities I could 
occupy not only the entire time of this morning's session with interest 
to the Saints, but even longer. 

On my way home after attending the funeral of Brother Kimball, 
in Arizona, I stopped for a few days in California, and the work in 
the California mission is progressing in a very favorable way. 

THE DIVINITY OF JESUS CHRIST 

There is one thing that I desire to refer to, and a part of one 
of the revelations that I desire to read. There are no revelations in 
the Doctrine and Covenants that have made such a profound im- 
pression upon my heart and my mind as the one known as The Vision, 
recorded in the 76th section, and the one known as Prayer and 
Prophecies, given in Liberty Jail, and to be found in the 121st section. 
I rejoice every time I read the wonderful testimony of the Prophet 
Joseph and Sidney Rigdon as contained in The Vision. When bishops 
over large churches in England announce that Jesus Christ was not 
the Son of God ; that he was not divine, but merely a great moral 
teacher ; when men who are ministers deny the divinity of Christ and 
are being tried for their lack of faith, I rejoice in reading the testimony 
of these two men, and never read it but my heart swells with gratitude 
to God : 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is 
the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds . are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

I rejoice that the Church of Jesus Christ is founded upon the 
first great vision that was enjoyed by the boy Joseph Smith over one 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

hundred years ago. He declared that he saw two heavenly beings, 
whose glory and grandeur were beyond the power of man to describe 
and that one of them addressed him and pointed to the other and said : 
"This is my beloved Son, hear him." There cannot be any doubt in 
the heart of a Latter-day Saint regarding Jesus Christ being the Son 
of the Living God, because God himself introduced him to Joseph 
Smith. It is a fundamental truth of the Church of Jesus Christ in our 
day that Joseph Smith was and is and ever will be a prophet of the 
living God ; and with Joseph Smith recognized as a prophet of God, 
and the testimony in our hearts of that fact, there will never be any 
schism, so to speak, in the Church of Christ. Any individual who 
does not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Redeemer 
of the world, has no business to be associated with the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This Church is, as I read to you 
it should be, a marvelous work and a wonder. There is nothing like 
it in all the world, because Jesus Christ, the Son of God established 
it, and is the head of it ; because Jesus Christ manifested himself to the 
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, and to others; and because God, in 
answer to prayer, has given to people all over the wide world where 
the Gospel has gone, an individual knowledge and testimony regarding 
the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. 

A PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSIVE COMPARISON 

Never have I been more profoundly impressed with the power 
and blessing of God than I was when I visited Nauvoo upon my 
recent trip East. Three quarters of a century ago there were twenty 
thousand prosperous Latter-day Saints in that city, with a magnificent 
temple. Today there is not a single stone left of the temple where 
it was once erected, and the population has dwindled to about one 
thousand people. Men have told me that the site of the City of Nauvoo 
is one of the finest, if not the finest, to be found upon the great 
Mississippi river, yet to get there now you have to cross the Mississippi 
river in a little tub of a steamer, on the deck of which there are but 
five chairs, and as there happened to be six in our party one of us had 
to stand ; and there are cities with thousands of inhabitants on the 
Mississippi and on the Missouri that have grown up since that was 
the great city of Illinois. When I contemplate all these things and 
then come home and gaze upon the Temple of God in the eastern 
part of this block; when I look at our office building, at the Utah 
Hotel, and at the magnificent bank buildings in our city ; when I think 
of the prosperity of the Saints, with beautiful temples, not only in 
Utah, but in Canada and in the Hawaiian Islands, as well as one in 
course of construction in Arizona ; when I think of all the accomplish- 
ments of the work of God, my language utterly fails me to speak in 
just praise of all that has been done. When I realize the condition of 
the place from which we were driven, the lack of prosperity and of 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



success in that country, I thank God that we are located here in these 
mountains. I feel that the very persecutions and troubles through 
which we passed prepared us and educated us and strengthened us 
as a people for greater things. Perhaps the very finest residence, 
with one exception, to be found today in Nauvoo is the one erected 
by Erastus Snow. They told me that it was erected by Lorenzo Snow, 
but I have since been informed that the people there were mistaken, 
and that it was erected by Erastus Snow. One of the fine dwellings 
there was built with stones taken from the Temple Block. 

I rejoice in the testimony of my own dear mother, also in the 
testimony of Aunt Emmeline B. Wells and scores of men and women 
who were present upon that memorable occasion, after the martyrdom 
of the Prophet Joseph, when Sidney Rigdon endeavored to be ap- 
pointed as guardian of the Church. I rejoice in the wonderful mani- 
festation that was given to the people there, including my mother and 
other relatives of mine, when the mantle of Joseph Smith fell upon 
the Prophet Brigham Young, and he, Brigham, stood there and talked 
as with the voice of Joseph, his face being illumined and in appear- 
ance like unto the face of Joseph. The sheep knew the voice of the 
true shepherd. And from that day to this, of the hundreds who were 
present on that occasion, nearly every one has lived and died faith- 
ful and true to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, loyal supporters of the 
Prophet Brigham Young and his successors. 

HOW TO EXERCISE THE POWER OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

I desire to read part of the wonderful revelation given to the 
Prophet Joseph in Liberty Jail. Remember, though he was chained 
in that prison, the Lord Almighty could and did speak to him, and 
gave to him a revelation that I commend here today to every Latter- 
day Saint. I particularly commend it to every man presiding in the 
stakes and wards of Zion, and in the various missions throughout the 
world. If we exercise the power of the Priesthood of the living God 
as he tells us in this wonderful revelation to exercise it, then there 
never can be and there never will be any just complaint made against 
the Church of Jesus Christ, because of the use of the Priesthood that 
has been restored again to the earth. It is when men do not follow 
the teachings and the revelations given of God to us through his 
prophet that mistakes are made. This revelation declares that by 
incarcerating the Prophet Joseph men could not rob him of the inspira- 
tion of the Living God, which revealed to him these wonderful words 
in that prison. Starting with verse 33, I read : 

"How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 

"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers 
of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled 
only upon the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, or vain ambition, or to exercise con- 
trol or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any 
degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the 
Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priest- 
hood or the authority of that man. 

"Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, 
to persecute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

"We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of 
almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will 
immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul with- 
out hypocrisy, and without guile — 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou 
hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy ; 

"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly ; then shall thy 
confidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine of the priest- 
hood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth ; and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
forever and ever." 

I feel that I cannot close my remarks with anything better than 
this wonderful revelation given to the Prophet of the living God. 

god's blessings invoked upon the church and nation 

I pray God's blessings to be upon the Latter-day Saints all over 
the wide world. I pray for those who stand as the General Authorities 
of the Church. I pray for those who preside in the stakes and the 
wards and the branches, and in all parts of the Church, from Canada 
on the North to Mexico on the South, and for those who preside and 
labor in the various missions all over the wide world. I pray for the 
people of the world; not only for the Latter-day Saints, but I pray 
God's blessings upon every loyal, patriotic man and woman that is 
endeavoring to do right, and to uphold the laws of the countries where 
they reside. I pray God's blessings upon the President of these United 
States of America. I thank God for the loyalty and the patriotism 
of the Latter-day Saints. I thank God that we believe that the con- 
stitution of our country was given to us under the inspiration of the 
Living God, and that the Lord supported George Washington and the

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



patriot fathers of this country. I pray that God will inspire us to 
continue loyal and true to him, to our country, and to its institutions ; 
and that we may in very deed preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ by our acts; that, as we grow in years and increase in under- 
standing, we may grow in the power and ability to live the Gospel, 
that our example of integrity, of honesty, of loyaltv to God and 
country may inspire others to investigate the message of life and 
salvation. 

CLOSING TESTIMONY 

Before sitting down, I bear my testimony to you and to all the 
world that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the 
world, the Savior of mankind, the Creator of heaven and earth ; that 
Joseph Smith was his prophet, the instrument in his hands of establish- 
ing again the Gospel of life and salvation. That we who have that 
knowledge may live the Gospel is my prayer, and I ask in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

My brethren and sisters, I am very happy to have the privilege of 
again meeting with the Latter-day Saints in a General Conference. 
I did not have this privilege six months ago, and I have felt the loss 
which is sustained by every member of this Church who does not 
participate in the spirit and the exercises of these great gatherings. 

A TESTIMONY OF JESUS 

I bear witness to the testimony borne by President Grant this 
morning. I say with him that I know that God lives, that Jesus Christ 
is the Son of God, and that Joseph Smith was the prophet of these 
latter days, called to restore the eternal gospel of Christ. I am happy 
in the possession of this truth ; and I ask for nothing more than that 
the Lord may so help me to live, day by day throughout the years 
that may remain, that I may retain this testimony and be willing to 
(bear it to all who may care to listen. 

A REMARKABLE AGE OF THE WORLD 

Yesterday morning, before I left my home, I picked up a paper 
which is circulated in this country by the hundreds of thousands of 
copies. I turned to the editorial page, and to my surprise saw a state- 
ment by the editor to the effect that what this great country needs 
today, these great United States of America, is a close of Voltaire. I 
suppose he meant by that a dose of atheism. That statement has re- 
mained in my thoughts, because it seems to be another evidence of the 
fact that after these many centuries of light, of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, many in the world, even among professed Christians, are unable 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE

or unwilling to accept the truth of the gospel, or the existence of God. 

This is a marvelous age. It is clear to all who follow the events of 
the day, and who note the great steps of progress from month to month, 
that this is in many respects the most remarkable age that the world 
has known. The air above us, the seas, the solid earth, the whole physi- 
cal universe, all seem unitedly to bow before man, to his acquired 
power over the natural forces of the universe. Today, man is able 
to do things that in clays gone by were conceivably done only by God. 
Yet, as I read the editorial in this famous newspaper, an old thought 
came back to me, that the airship, the steamship, the telephone, the 
radio and all the other marvels of this age, are but as the clothing of 
the body, but as instruments to be used by man. By means of these 
great inventions and discoveries, great gifts of God to the people of 
these latter days, it is possible for the righteous man to accomplish 
righteousness more widely and more speedily, but it is equally true that 
by means of these great modern developments the wicked man may do 
wickedness much more easily and much more comprehensively than in 
the days gone by. The discoveries with which we conjure in this day 
have not touched the mainspring of human character, have not shaped 
or reshaped human conduct. Something deeper than material con- 
quests relates itself to human conduct, to that manner of life, which in 
the end makes the world great or small, good or bad. A knowledge of 
God, and faith in his word have ever been the determining force in the 
making of the character of a man or a nation. 

MAN HELPLESS WITHOUT GOD 

If the world needs atheism, at this day, then the faith of this 
poor world of ours must concern itself entirely with man's own 
powers. Take God away from the earth and man has left only that 
which his own powers may produce, and he must become a worshiper 
of his own power. Centuries of human experience, and the events of 
every day, demonstrate the utter inadequacy of man's unaided power 
in winning human happiness. Life becomes full and rounded only as 
the forces beyond man are accepted and used by him.. Man is help- 
less without God. 

A GREAT INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL CONTROVERSY 

Such thoughts have been brought home to us especially during 
the last twelve months by a great intellectual and spiritual controversy, 
among honest people, which has shaken this country, and which is 
spreading across the seas into other countries, the result of which will 
probably appear much more important when history is written than 
the great wars and political contentions of the day. The modernists 
who already have been discussed from this stand say that they believe 
in an Almighty God, but declare that they are unable to believe in 
the virgin birth of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. They declare 
themselves unable to accept as real the miracles of Christ as recorded 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in Holy Writ. They say that, above all things, they cannot believe 
that man after death may be brought into a life again, to live forever 
as a personal embodied being. These doubts are before them, as they 
say, because man is not able to understand how such things may be 
done. 

These people, however good and sincere they may be, are engaged 
in an old pastime; they limit God and try to make him great only as 
man is great. They say in substance that God can do only that which 
man himself is able to do, or only that which can be understood by 
man. This limitation has been attempted before ; it is not a new thing. 
It is surprising how, in this latter day, in this greatest civilization, we 
return, over and over, to such age-old controversies. I have no doubt 
that in the days of Adam men differed as do these modernists and 
others of today, with respect to the nature and character or the exist- 
ence of God. 

It seems curious to me that a man can say that he believes in a 
God who is the author of life, of the unfathomable mystery of life, 
and in the same breath can declare that he cannot believe that God is 
able to cause the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ. It is difficult 
for me to understand the mind of a man who believes in a God who 
has raised the bottom of the sea into mountains, and has made the 
mountain-tops into sea-bottoms, and yet cannot believe in the possibility 
of the miracles of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is still more 
mysterious to me how, in this modern day, men may say that they 
believe in a God who has made this great earth out of eternal elements 
and indestructible forces, but that man, the sum of creation, the most 
marvelous product of God's handiwork, upon this earth, is a transitory 
being, to be laid down in the grave, and if he ever emerges, to be" 
merged quiescently with the forces of the hereafter. 

DANGEROUS TO LIMIT THE POWERS OF GOD 

I am inclined to think, though I recognize that these seekers after 
truth are honest and desire to do the right thing in their seeking after 
truth — I always desire to give them credit for that — that there is no 
great difference between the modernist of today and the idol wor- 
shiper of the past. Heathen nations have set up a god to produce 
rain, and another to produce crops, and in a dry year of small har- 
vests they have slapped the ears of both gods. It is dangerous to 
limit in our thinking the powers of God, to allow ourselves to say that 
God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, the Founder of truth, 
is limited simply because we are limited in our understanding. It 
leads men to unbelief and atheism. 

i 

SOMETHING, HOWEVER, TO BE SAID FOR THE MODERNIST 

Yet, brethren and sisters, I would like to say that there is some- 
thing to be said for the modernist, because, after all, he has broken 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



13 



away from the unacceptable traditions of the past. What has the 
fundamentalist, his brother, to give him? Just a short time ago I 
met two priests of a church well known in the world, who explained 
to me at great length that God is a person, yes, but a person who fills 
the whole universe in person, and who, at the same time, in person 
complete and whole, is in every human heart. That is beyond my 
understanding. This summer I met a minister of another church well 
known in the world, who explained to me that God made matter out 
of nothing, and then, having made sufficient matter out of nothing, 
he proceeded to build an earth from the matter so created. I cannot 
understand that. A few weeks ago, a member of another Church 
wrote to me and said that God was in the beauty of the rose, in the 
melody of a song, in the tenderness of a mother's heart; and that was 
all there is of God. No wonder people break away from such con- 
ceptions. No wonder that we have modernists breaking away from 
fundamentalists. The fact of the matter is that in this day with re- 
spect to the existence and character of God the blind are leading the 
blind. 

A FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE 

Among the great doctrines revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
none is greater or more fundamental, as has been explained today by 
the living Prophet of today, than that God is from everlasting to 
everlasting ; so far as we can understand without beginning and with- 
out end ; the Father of our spirits, who in so far as he deals with 
human life may be understood by us, and who understands us because 
we are his children ; a God whose glory is intelligence, and whose work 
and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. 
There is no need for us of this Church to become fundamentalists or 
modernists or to set up new theories as to divinity, for God has re- 
vealed himself so clearly in these latter days that, with respect to our 
human life, every one of us may understand to a sufficient degree the 
nature of God and his relationship to the human family. 

THE LORD HAS DECLARED HIMSELF IN ALL GENERATIONS 

I rejoice in such truths. T rejoice to know that God in person 
came down to commission the boy, Joseph Smith, with prophetic 
power in these latter days. As President Grant has stated here today 
there is no doubt in our minds about the reality of the First Vision of 
Joseph Smith. Every religion is built upon a conception of God. The 
Lord, knowing this, has declared himself in all generations. The 
first statement in Holy Writ makes it clear that man must understand 
the true God and must not worship false gods nor set up gods for 
himself. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" — 
Almighty God, not blind forces, made the earth and the heavens above. 
Later on, out of the thunders and lightnings of Sinai, the first com- 
mandment was : "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." And 
on the back of the statue of Joseph Smith, in this square, you will 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



find as a great fundamental message, that "It is the first great prin- 
ciple of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God." 

ALL SH4.LL BOW BEFORE THE ONE TRUE GOD 

The people of the earth are gradually beginning to understand 
the truths respecting God, though they are unwilling to abide by them. 
I read in a recent magazine — I clipped out the verses because they 
seemed so applicable to our belief — a verse which reads something 
like this : 

"We serve no God whose work is done, 

Who rests within his firmament. 
Our God, his labors but begun, 

Toils evermore, with power unspent." 

And so, the truth of this latter day work is filtering in among the 
nations, and filling the hearts and souls and understandings of men. 
After a while I have no doubt that all shall bow before the one true 
God, the one who made the heavens and the earth, and who has 
spoken throughout all these ages to his children, even if obedience is 
not shown him. 

It is possible to know God. There are thousands in this Church, 
there have been hundreds of thousands, who are and have been able to 
bear witness to that. There are hosts of people, who, in this Church, 
have sacrificed all for the love of the gospel, separated from their 
kindred, met the hardships of pioneer life, sacrificed all worldly ambi- 
tions, and then, at the close of life, have testified fearlessly that God 
has been good to them, that throughout their lives, in all their sacrifices, 
they have been simply carrying out the great purposes of Almighty 
God, that they have been engaged in the cause of truth, that they know 
of a certainty that God lives, that he has spoken in these latter days, 
and that it is good to be in his work. These testimonies from the 
thousands who have borne them become one great shout to heaven 
that God may be known, and that this work is a work of truth. A 
knowledge of God is the need of this and of every land. To know 
him and to serve him is the certain way to human happiness. 

WE REST UPON THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST 

There is no other gathering on the face of the earth such as we 
have here this morning; such a great body of men and women who 
see alike and think alike. We rest ourselves upon truth, the simple 
truth, the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are willing to live by that truth, 
and if necessary to die for it. I am deeply grateful that I know this 
truth; that God, in his mercy, brought it to my mother and to me. I 
praise God for it every day of my life. I know that you do the same. 
May the Lord be with us and make us strong in his cause. May we 
grow in a knowledge of God and his desires with respect to us, and 
be willing always to sacrifice whatever may be required of us for his 
great cause, I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

It is indeed a pleasure and a great privilege to be present here 
this morning, and to stand before this great audience and bear testi- 
mony to the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. I trust that 
the Spirit of the Lord will direct the few remarks which I may make. 

Listening to the revelation which was read by our President this 
morning, and which was given by the Lord to a kinsman of mine whom 
the Lord gave responsibility in the early history of the Church in this 
dispensation, I was touched with the simplicity of the words of our 
Father to a great grandsire of mine — counsel and advice which is good 
today for the souls of men. Without referring to the whole revelation 
I should like to refer to one of the remarkable paragraphs in that im- 
portant and wonderful revelation. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, broth- 
erly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence." Do you know 
of any advice or counsel that is not contained in those words? There 
is one word which may be implied but is not said — no Latter-day Saint 
can receive the blessings of the Lord without honesty. We must be 
honest with ourselves, honest with our neighbors, honest with our God, 
and then we are entitled to his blessings, to the confidence of our neigh- 
bors, to the confidence and fellowship of those who are around us. 
These words of counsel are applicable to all of us as members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

In visiting among the people, as it is my privilege, I have dis- 
covered that the Lord has been very kind to us as a people. We 
have struggled through this year which has beer. 1 and is known to us 
as one of the dry years, when we have not had sufficient rain and 
moisture for our needs in many cases ; but in the kindness of the Lord 
conditions have been brought about which have brought us to a very 
happy condition, for there are none among us who are suffering to the 
extreme. True there have been many losses, true we have not accom- 
plished all that we might have done ; but the Lord has been merciful 
and I wish to acknowledge his hand, not only in behalf of myself, but 
in behalf of the people and of the Church, and I praise the Lord in 
your behalf that He has been mindful of and merciful to us as a people, 
as individuals and as an organized Church. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is organized for 
the last time. It is the kingdom of God that has been set up in the last 
day never more to be thrown down nor given to another people. It is 
that organization which was made plain to the great king of Babylon 
through the instrumentality of the Prophet Daniel; that in the last 
days the God of heaven should set up a kingdom likened unto a stone 
cut out of the mountains without hands, that should smite the great 
beast which the king saw and break it in pieces, and this stone should 
roll forth and fill the whole earth. The Church of Jesus Christ of 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Latter-day Saints is that kingdom of God which has been set up never 
more to be thrown down nor given to another people. It has not 
come from men of earthly power or from any earthly or man-made 
organization. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 
neither father nor mother in the earth, for it has not come out of any 
organization in the earth. It has corne in the manner predicted, as 
a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, for the power, the keys, 
the authority and all the privileges that come to us to serve in the name 
of the Lord have come from heaven, through heavenly powers and 
heavenly messengers. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know with 
all the powers that I have to know, that these heavenly messengers 
did come to the Prophet Joseph Smith and did restore to the earth 
all the keys and powers of authority which are in the Church today, 
and that men are called upon to bear the Holy Priesthood which is the 
power to officiate in the Church for the Lord, to do his work, to 
bring about his marvelous work on earth in these the last days. I 
bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that the power and 
keys of authority to officiate in the name of the Lord for the salvation 
of the souls of men both for the living and for the dead are in the 
Church today. I have seen their marvelous power made manifest. I 
know that this power rests with the authorities of the Church as they 
are at present constituted the prophets, apostles, pastors, evangelists, 
teachers and other men who are called to bear this important responsi- 
bility, to bring about the mighty purposes of God in these the last days. 
I thank the Lord for this testimony. I know it is the truth and I 
praise the Lord for his kindness and his mercy in bestowing upon his 
children this plain truth, so that we are not in doubt. We: do not 
wander in our minds, but we know, like little children, that we have 
a father, and a .mother in heaven, and that we have our loved ones 
there. We know that if we are true to the teachings, counsels and 
instructions that are given unto us ; that if we are honest and virtuous 
and faithful, and patient, and diligent, and practice all these other 
qualities that belong to Latter-day Saints, we shall receive the bless- 
ings of the Lord, we shall find that happy clay in the hereafter when 
we shall be associated with our loved ones, and with the men and 
women whom God has honored, who have gone before us. Certain 
powers are in the Church today which, if we are faithful in receiving, 
will bind us together in families, in the links of brotherhood and father- 
hood forever: we will claim a natural relationship, to our fathers and 
our mothers, and to our brothers and sisters, not for this life only, but 
for all eternity. These are the keys and the powers and the blessings 
that will come to us if we will only live worthy lives and be obedient 
to the teachings and counsels which come to us from our merciful 
Heavenly Father. 

Now brethren and sisters, as a servant of the Lord, in humility I 
pray God to bless you, and say unto you that he will bless you. He 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



17 



will continue to bless those whom he has called to preside in this great 
and important work, from the President of the Church to the least and 
last one who is or who may be called ; whether to labor at home or 
abroad ; for this is God's work and not the work of man or men, and 
it will roll forth even as Daniel declared when he interpreted the great 
king's dream that it should in time fill the whole earth. 

May God bless you in your homes, may he continue to be mind- 
ful of you in your labors, that you may be honest with him in all of 
the possessions and blessings that came to you, that you may remember 
the Lord — whether in poverty or wealth, it matters not. The Lord will 
require only a certain amount from each of us. Let us be true and 
honest and faithful to the end. I pronounce upon you, my brethren 
and sisters, and upon the Church, the blessings of the Lord, the bless- 
ings of Jesus Christ, for this is his Church, and his blessings will con- 
tinue with his Church and with his people. I pray that his mercies may 
continue to attend us, and for his spirit to inspire those who speak and 
pray and sing, and take other parts in this conference, that we may 
be encouraged and built up in our faith to return to our homes and 
abiding places after this conference, inspired and blessed and com- 
forted and sustained to serve God and keep his commandments, and 
work out his mighty purposes according to his will as it has been made 
known to us, and may the peace and blessing of the Almighty be upon 
you all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Elder Orson F. Whitney, will be our next speaker. We all 
rejoice in the recovery of Brother Whitney's health. On account of 
being in Europe for some time, he has not had many privileges of speak- 
ing to us. He will occupy the balance of the time. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

THE MARVELOUS WORK AND WONDER 

Seven hundred years before the birth of the Savior, a Prophet oi 
God upon the Eastern hemisphere proclaimed the coming forth of a 
marvelous work and wonder. The reason for its coming forth was 
given by the Lord through that Prophet as follows : 

"Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with 
their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and 
their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: 

"Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people, even a marvelous work and wonder: for the wisdom of their wise 
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be 
hid,"— Isaiah 29:13, 14. 

The angel Moroni, who appeared to Joseph Smith on the night 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the 21st of September, one hundred and one years ago, cited this 
prediction, among others, as relating to the Lord's work in latter days. 
He identified those words of Isaiah with the movement which the 
world now calls "Mormonism." 

FUNDAMENTAL FACTS 

And what could be more wonderful, more marvelous, than the 
basic facts upon which "Mormonism" rests ? — beginning with the appear- 
ance of the Father and the Son to a boy fourteen years of age, announcing 
the opening of a new Gospel dispensation ; then the coming of an 
angel to reveal the hidden past and future of the American continents, 
as set forth in that ancient record, the Book of Mormon, containing 
also the fulness of the everlasting gospel ; the coming of another angel, 
John the Baptist, to confer upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery 
the Aaronic Priesthood, which holds the keys of the ministering of 
angels and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; the 
visitation of three other heavenly messengers, the Apostles Peter, James 
and John, delivering the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood, the 
power to bestow the Holy Ghost upon those baptized in the right 
manner and by the proper authority. By virtue of these priesthoods this 
Church was organized, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
(April 6, 1830), and thus was lifted the ensign for the gathering of 
scattered Israel, the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that they 
might be ready to meet their God and King, who is coming to reign 
literally upon the earth. Subsequently came Moses, to restore the keys 
of the gathering, to authorize the assembling of the House of Israel ; 
then Elias, repeating the promise made to Abraham, that in him and 
in his seed should all the nations of the earth be blessed — a promise 
fulfilled in the coming of Christ through the lineage of the Hebrew 
patriarchs, and in the dispersion of Israel among all nations, so that 
the [blood that believes, that has faith in ' the true God, might be 
sprinkled over the world, and that out of every nation under heaven 
might come in the last days some of the chosen people, to build up Zion 
on this goodly land and prepare the way before the glorious coming 
of the Lord. Finally the Prophet Elijah, who- holds all the keys of the 
Priesthood, appears and confers upon Joseph and Oliver "the keys to 
turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the 
fathers," in order that a link might be welded between the living and the 
dead, between the present and the past, and a work done that will 
eventually unify and bring together all things in Christ, both in heaven 
and on earth. What could be more marvelous, more wonderful than 
this? And yet the wisdom of the world passes it by as a thing of 
naught. 

WORLDLY WISDOM'S ATTITUDE 

Wise and gifted men will come into the midst of God's people ; 
they will praise the industry, the thrift, the honesty and uprightness 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



19 



of the Latter-day Saints ; but they seem to have no conception of the 
more glorious features of the Lord's Work. They praise Brigham 
Young as a colonizer, as a builder of cities, as the founder of a common- 
wealth; but they know nothing at all about Brigham Young as a 
prophet, seer and revelator. Agriculture, mining, and other tempor- 
alities, things of earth and time, they appreciate ; but they take no 
cognizance whatever of spiritual things, things pertaining to heaven 
and eternity. 

Horace greeley's visit 

Many years ago a famous and prominent personage came to Utah. 
It was in the days of the stage coach and the pony express, before the 
transcontinental railroad had crossed the country, before there was 
even a telegraph line between the Missouri and the Pacific. He was 
the founder and editor of a great newspaper — the New York Tribune. 
His word was more influential than that of the President of the United 
States. Whatever Horace Greeley said was accepted by the American 
people almost as the word of God. He came here and spent a week 
or more, had several long interviews with President Brigham Young, 
and after returning East wrote and published a book entitled "Across 
the Continent." In it he praised the "Mormon" people for their 
sobriety and industry. He did not believe that they were robbers and 
murderers, as he had been told. They were sincere and honest, he said, 
and had done a wonderful work in peopling the waste and redeeming 
the desert. But he had not a word to say concerning the glories of 
our religion. Why was it ? 

A CATHOLIC COMMENT 

I bear in mind another noted visitor, a great scholar, who came 
here many years after the advent of the railroad. I became we 1 ! ac- 
quainted with him, and we had more than one conversation together. 
I admired his vast erudition. He seemed to know all about law, litera- 
ture, science, philosophy, and had a dozen languages at his tongue's 
end. He said to me one day: "You Mormons are all ignoramuses. 
You don't even know the strength of your own position. It is so 
strong that there is only one other position tenable in the whole Christian 
world, and that is the position of the Roman Catholic Church. The 
issue is between Mormonism and Catholicism. If you are right, we 
are wrong. If we are right, you are wrong. And that's all there is to 
it. These Protestant sects haven't a leg to stand on ; for if we are 
right, we cut them off long ago as apostates ; and if we are wrong, they 
are wrong with us, for they were part of us and came out of us. If 
we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter as we claim, there 
was no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism ; but if we have not 
that succession, such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary and Mor- 
monism's position is the only consistent one. It is either the per- 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



petuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the 
gospel in latter days." 

I replied : "Doctor, I agree with you in almost everything that 
you have said ; but don't deceive yourself with the notion that we 
'Mormons' do not know the strength of our own position. We know 
it better than you do ; we know it better than any other people can 
know it. We have not all been to college; we cannot all speak the 
dead languages, and we may be ignoramuses as you say, but we know 
we are right, and we know that you are wrong." I was just as frank 
with him as he had been with me. 

Now what was the position of this learned man? He could not 
see into the heart of "Mormonism," with all his learning, his dead 
and living languages, his knowledge of science, law and literature. 
He could not comprehend this great problem. Why? Because God 
Almighty had said concerning him and bis class : "The wisdom of their 
wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men 
shall be hid." He thought that Joseph Smith had stumbled upon 
something of which he did not know the true value. A greater mistake 
was never made, a grosser error never committed. Joseph Smith re- 
ceived his knowledge, his power, and wisdom from on High. He 
did not stumble upon it ; it came by divine revelation, and he knew, 
better than anyone else, the strength of the "Mormon" position. 

AN EPISCOPAL VIEW 

Years later I formed the acquaintance of a bishop of the Episcopal 
Church, a very worthy and scholarly gentleman, whose untimely, ac- 
cidental death in this city we all deplored. He remarked to me on 
one occasion : "If Joseph Smith, at the outset of his career, had made 
the acquaintance of the Episcopalians, he never would have sought 
any further for spiritual light. But instead, he came upon the Method- 
ists, the Baptists, the Presbyterians ; and their conflicting creeds and 
claims bewildered the boy, compelling him to look elsewhere. Now if 
he had only become acquainted with Episcopalianism, which has an un- 
broken succession of authority all down the centuries, he never would 
have gone to the trouble of organizing another church." Such was this 
wise man's opinion. "Mormonism" was to him only one more broken 
off fragment of the ancient Christian faith. He could not grasp the 
idea of its being the ancient Christian faith restored. 

AN ABSURD THEORY 

But I think the shallowest and vainest attempt to explain away 
Joseph Smith and "Mormonism." was made by a learned man who 
was applying for a Doctor's degree from Yale University. He 
wrote a thesis, as the basis for his application, taking Joseph Smith 
and "Mormonism" as his subject. And all that he could say concern- 
ing this marvelous work and wonder, was that a boy named Joseph 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



21 



Smith, being an epileptic, had fallen in a fit and imagined that he saw 
the Father and the Son ; imagined that he beheld angels ; imagined 
that the heavens were opened to him and that he received communica- 
tions from Above. 

Think of it ! Here is a great Church organization which challenges 
the admiration of intelligent men all over the world. I wish I had 
time to describe it, even hastily — but you know it. This Church was 
once compared to the German army, in the excellence and perfection of 
its organization. That was when Germany had an army — but of course 
no comparison is possible between the work of God and the work of 
man. This Church is conceded to be a most superior organization, and 
"Mormonism," as you all know who have studied it, is replete with 
doctrines of beauty and sublimity, unequaled anywhere — full of science, 
full of poetry, full of philosophy, full of truth. And yet this wonder- 
ful scheme of religion and this unparalleled system of government, 
all sprang from the disordered brain of a fourteen-year old boy who 
had fallen in an epileptic fit ! There are some things that do not need 
answering; they answer themselves. This is one of them. 

THE REVEALING SPIRIT 

There is only one way to comprehend God and the things of 
God, and the Apostle Paul struck the keynote when he said : 

"Eye liath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart 
of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 

"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit 
searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 

"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man 
which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the 
Spirit of God."— 1 Cor. 2:9-11. 

And that is why the Spirit of God is given to every man, woman 
and child who joins the Church of Christ. We have received that 
Spirit as a gift from God, because we have done His will. Therefore 
we "know of the doctrine." We have had faith, have repented of 
our sins, have had our sins washed away by baptism, and have re- 
ceived the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. That is the key to the 
situation. 

Why couldn't Horace Greeley see what you and I see in "Mor- 
monism?" Why couldn't Dr. Reiner see it? Why couldn't Bishop 
Spalding or Mr. Riley see it? Because they were without the Spirit 
that comprehends the things of God. And we, without that Spirit, would 
be just as short-sighted in our views, would make just as many mistakes 
as do other men in relation to the Lord's work. It is not our smartness, 
not our native intelligence that enables us to understand these things. 
We have come out from the Gentile world. We have their blood in 
our veins. We are no more intelligent than they, naturally ; but we 
have received something that they do not possess ; that is the whole

solution. The credit is not to us ; it is to our Father in Heaven, who 
has given us this precious gift, the power to comprehend him and 
his purposes, and rightly interpret his word. 

ST. JOHN INTERPRETED 

Suppose we should open the Bible at the first chapter of St. 
John, and read : "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was 
with God, and the Word was God, * * * and the Word was made 
flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory." And then read 
a little farther on: "No man hath seen God at any time." Who can 
interpret that? Evidently "the Word" means our Savior, in whom 
dwelt "the fulness of the Godhead bodily." He was God in the flesh, 
and many men saw him; and yet John says, or is made to say: "No 
man hath seen God at any time." Who can interpret it? Who can 
explain the apparent contradiction? 

THE FATHER AND THE SON 

True, it might be shown that when John said : "No man hath 
seen God at any time," he was referring, not to the Son of God, but 
to God the Father. This is evident from the text (1:14, 18). But 
even here the same difficulty arises; for Adam had seen God, Enoch 
had walked with him, and he had appeared to Abraham, Moses, 
Aaron, and others, long before "the Word was made flesh" and was 
called the Son of God "because of the flesh." Joseph Smith saw both 
the Father and the Son, but the wise world rejects his testimony, 
and most believers in the Bible adhere to the dead letter of John's 
declaration, (which may or may not have been correctly transmitted), 
unheeding the divine admonition : "The letter killeth, but the Spirit 
giveth life." 

a "mormon" boy's wit 

One of our "Mormon" boys out on a mission was confronted with 
this question. He had just been preaching that the Father and the 
Son appeared to Joseph Smith, when a voice rang out : "No man hath 
seen God at any time," The boy had his wits about him. "Of course 
not," said he, "God is a business man — you can't see him at any time; 
you have to make a special appointment with him." (Laughter.) He 
answered a fool according to his folly, but that of course is not the 
explanation. 

MOSES EXPLAINS 

Read the Book of Moses. That mighty man of God had an 
experience of which Joseph Smith's was almost the exact counterpart. 
He wrestled with Satan, and was delivered from darkness. He saw 
God, and tells how he saw him, in these words : 

"Now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but 
my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld ; for I 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



23 



should have withered and died in his presence ; but his glory was upon 
me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him." 

THE SPIRIT SIGHT 

That is what John meant when he said : "No man hath seen God 
at any time." And that is what Paul meant, in saying: "Eye hath 
not seen, nor ear heard." It means that no man with his natural eyes 
can see God in his glory. He must use his spirit eyes, the eyes with 
which he "walked by sight" when a spirit in the spirit world, the eyes 
that he saw with before coming to earth and receiving his natural eyes. 
In this second estate, where we "walk by faith," we are not permitted 
to use at all times our spirit sight. But now and then the Lord chooses 
one from among men, and gives him that rare privilege. The power 
of God comes upon such a one, transfigures him, opens his spirit eyes, 
and constitutes him a seer in the highest sense of the term. Such a 
man was Moses. Such a man was the brother of Jared, such a man 
was Nephi, and such a man was Joseph Smith. There have been many 
such men. They have seen God actually, literally, but it was with 
their spiritual and not with their natural eyes. "The natural man is 
an enemy to God ;" the natural eye cannot behold him, the natural ear 
cannot hear him. But the spirit eye can behold him, and the spirit 
ear can hear him. With the Spirit of the Lord upon us, we can see 
and comprehend God, so far as he chooses to make himself known. 
This is the great differentiating feature between the Latter-day Saints 
and those who have not received the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

God grant us the power to retain this precious gift, which com- 
prehends all things, which explains the past, the present and the future, 
shows us where we came from, why we are here, and where we are 
going when we leave this life, making manifest the things o'f God, 
both of time and of eternity. May we keep the fire burning - , the 
lamp lit, which the Lord has lighted within us, to lead and guide us 
into all truth, Amen. 

President Heber J. Grant gave notice that a free concert will be 
held in the Tabernacle this evening, to which all are invited. An ex- 
cellent program of singing has been arranged. 

The congregation sang, "Do what is right." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Byron O. Colton, president 
of the Roosevelt stake of Zion. 

The meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant announced at 2 o'clock that the choir 
and congregation would sing, "O say what is truth ?" 

After the singing, Elder Franklin S. Harris, president of the Brig- 
ham Young University, opened the meeting with prayer.

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

I am dependent this afternoon upon the Lord and the faith of 
the congregation for what I shall say. We had a very excellent 
meeting this morning. I trust that the Lord by his spirit will continue 
to be with us. 

A CONUNDRUM 

I have in my hands an article entitled "Happiness," written by 
Bruno Lessing. I will read a few lines of said article. 

"Many a philosopher has propounded the conundrum, What is 
the object of life? Why have we been placed upon this planet, to 
struggle along for a few years and then to die ? Has a beneficent Provi- 
dence some scheme which we cannot fathom?' This conundrum has 
not yet been answered." 

THE ANSWER 

In reply to these words I may say that the conundrum here 
spoken of has been answered, and that a beneficent Providence has 
some scheme which we are able to fathom in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory solution of this great and important question, "What is 
the object of life?" We must necessarily hark back to the pre-existent 
state of our spirits. I know that this will seem to be a strange doctrine 
to many — the pre-existence of our spirits — but the scriptures are replete 
with references to this important subject. We are living here now. 
We lived before we came here. Let me submit a scripture or 
two bearing upon this subject : 

Hebrews 12:9: "Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh 
which corrected us, and we gave them reverence : shall we not much 
rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?" 

Numbers 16 :22 : "And they fell upon their faces, and said, O 
God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt 
thou be wroth with all the congregation?" 

Ecclesiastes 12:7: "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it 
was : and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." 

WE WERE THE CHILDREN OF GOD IN THE SPIRIT WORLD 

Now, brethren and sisters and friends, as a matter of fact, and as 
these scriptures which I have read, and many other scriptures, indi- 
cate, we existed before we came here and belonged to a great family 
of spirits in heaven. We speak of our Father in heaven. Jesus said, 
When you pray, say, "Our Father which art in heaven." We were his 
children in spirit, in heaven, and suffice it to say we also have a mother 
in heaven. There were parents in heaven — parents and children.

THE PURPOSE OF THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 

Let me say to you that when the earth was organized and rolled 
into existence, the Lord had a great and glorious purpose in view, and 
it was that these sons and daughters in the spirit world should come 
down to the earth and inhabit it. Now the first great creative act 
in the beginning of the world indicates the importance of this subject. 
We read in Genesis 2:7: 

"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and 
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living 
soul." 

MAN'S CREATION 

What a wonderful, marvelous statement this is. Think, my 
brethren and sisters, what it signifies! We learn from this passage 
that man could only develop into a perfect soul by taking a body. 
Perhaps that passage might be better understood if it were rendered 
in a little different way but with the same meaning — The Lord God 
formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils 
his spirit, and man became a living soul. It is the spirit which is 
the breath of life. And so man never did develop, and never could 
have developed into a perfect soul without the body. And thus we 
begin to get an insight into the purpose of life. The Lord said in 
one of the revelations to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, section 88 : 

"And the spirit and the body are the soul of man. And the 
resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul." 

REDEMPTION THROUGH THE GOSPEL AND TPIE RESURRECTION 

So that we get the impression from these scriptures that when 
man comes into the world, as we have done, he begins almost from the 
first to look forward to the redemption of his soul through the resurrec- 
tion. And how may this redemption be accomplished ? The answer 
has a bearing directly upon the object and purpose of life. Surely no 
man can be redeemed except he will obey the commandments of God. 
I take it that redemption means that we are redeemed from sickness, 
disease, trouble, sorrow and sin ; and that can only be brought about 
through obedience, as T said, to the commandments of God. These 
commandments of the Almighty are set forth in the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and if men reject the gospel how can they hope to come into 
the Church and kingdom of God, and be saved and redeemed? 

You will remember doubtless the conversation between Nicodemus 
and the Savior, when Nicodemus came to him privately by night, in 
order possibly to get further light and information. He confessed 
that he knew the Savior was a prophet because of the great works he 
had done. The Savior made what might seem to be a peculiar answer. 
He said: "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom 
of God." That was very confusing to Nicodemus. He could not 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



comprehend such a statement. He wondered how it might be. Could 
a man return to the spirit world and then be born again? In answer 
the Savior said, amplifying his first statement : "Except a man be 
born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of 
God." 

Now, brethren and .sisters, a rejection of the gospel is a bar, -an 
absolute bar, against any man or woman entering into the kingdom 
of God. 

The importance of the body, and we have been emphasizing that 
thought very considerably, is greatly emphasized by another revelation 
given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, section 93 : 

THE PURPOSE OF man's LIFE 

"For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and 
element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; 

"And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. 

"The elements are the tabernacle of God ; yea, man is the taber- 
nacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God 
shall destroy that temple." 

Now you see how directly this passage refers to the object of 
life, the very purpose of life. In securing a body, we are at once 
put upon the line of progress that leads to exaltation and glory. We 
could not do this in our spirit state, but the opportunity is before us 
here, because the Lord tells us that the body of man is composed of 
eletment, that spirit and element inseparably connected receiveth a 
fulness of joy, or a fulness of happiness. Happiness is the very thing 
that this writer is dealing with, and that is how it is to be obtained. 

THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST 

How beautiful, how wonderful, is the gospel of Jesus Christ ! 
What marvelous light is thrown upon our lives in mortality through 
the scriptures that we have. The question might be asked : How is 
it that philosophers and wise men, many of them, reject this light, 
reject the principles of the gospel? The answer is: Because they are 
not spiritually minded. These things can only be comprehended and 
fully understood by the Spirit of God, and not otherwise. And so 
vital is this question, so important to our welfare and happiness, that 
the Savior delivered this tremendous charge to his apostles after the 
crucifixion ; he said to them : "Go ye into all the world, and preach the 
gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned," or condemned, which 
means the same. So that those who turn away from the light and 
who reject the gospel, be they the learned or the unlearned, men or 
women, they are under condemnation, and, of course, will not attain 
to a fulness of happiness, to complete and perfect joy. Their wings, 
so to speak, will be clipped and they will come short. Now is it any

27 



wonder, my brethren and sisters, that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, in which is to be found the gospel in its fulness, 
should send it message to the ends of the earth by our elders? 

OUR DUTY TO CARRY THE GOSPEL MESSAGE TO THE WORLD 

It seems to me that it is our bounden duty, that the responsibility 
which was placed upon the apostles in early days rests now also upon 
the apostles of latter days and also upon the elders of Israel, to carry 
this message to the world; and as we have received the light freely, 
we are to give it to others freely. We cannot escape the responsibilty. 

Standing before you this afternoon, I solemnly testify that this 
work in which we are engaged is the Church and kingdom of God, 
that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was and is his Prophet, 
and the instrument in the hands of God in founding his Church upon 
the earth in these latter days. This is my testimony, and I rejoice in 
it. I glorify the Lord, and I am striving, and I hope to be able, to 
live the religion which has come to me, which is so perfect in all of 
its principles, and in the organization of the Church. Brethren and 
sisters, the Lord in heaven bless you and sustain you and strengthen 
you for your duties, and guide you continually, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I desire to read a portion of the 86th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, the same being a communication from the Lord Jesus 
Christ to the Prophet Joseph Smith, — and the address is made to all 
the Saints and elders of the Church. 

PROMISES TO BE FULFILLED IN OUR DAY 

The Lord admonishes the Latter-day Saints to have faith and 
confidence in the former promises made by the prophets of old, and 
gives us an assurance that we are living in a day when these great and 
precious promises are to be fulfilled; and the language which I now 
quote is as follows : 

"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood 
hath continued through the lineage of your fathers — 

"For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid 
from the world with Christ in God — 

"Therefore your life and the Priesthood have remained, and must needs 
remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things 
spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began. 

"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto 
the Gentiles, and through this Priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel. 
The Lord hath said it." 

How great and wonderful is this promise, that through this 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Church and this Priesthood shall be restored ultimately all that has 
been predicted and prophesied of concerning the great things God would 
do for men; and that these things are to be fulfilled and realized in 
our time. The Latter-day Saints are a people with a mission and a 
destiny, and we have not forgotten, I am sure, by the presence of this 
vast assembly, that we are still pursuing our destiny. We did not 
aspire to it, the Lord appointed it unto us, and the fulfilment of these 
promises surely can be and shall be realized in the Lord's own due 
time, and through his providing. 

THE PEOPLE, PLACE AND PLAN IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT 
OF THESE PROMISES 

Three things seem to me to be essential in the accomplishment of 
these wonderful promises : The Lord must have the right kind of 
people to do his work ; he must have them in the right place, and they 
must have the right plan. I said the Latter-day Saints are a people 
with a mission, they are entitled to that mission. 

THE DESCENDANTS OF JOSEPH THE RIGHT PEOPLE OF PROMISE 

I was thrilled not long ago when I read an article appearing in 
one of our national magazines. The author was discussing the ques- 
tion: "Are the Jews the Chosen People of God?" He denied them 
the right to claim for themselves and their posterity all the blessings 
pronounced upon all the sons of Jacob, but limited their blessings to 
their own particular line— the tribe of Judah. After tracing the 
history of the Jews and the several tribes of Israel the author con- 
cludes : "If we could find in the earth somewhere today the descend- 
ants of Joseph, we would find the chosen people of God," because the 
blessings of Joseph were so much greater than the blessings of his 
brethren that you will recall they despised him and were jealous of 
his blessings, and sold him into Egypt; but the Lord was with him 
and raised him up and made him mighty to become the deliverer of his 
father's household. I say, when I read that statement my soul thrilled 
with a new sensation of gratitude to God that I live to see the day 
when Joseph's children are being gathered again, and realize that the 
Latter-day Saints are of Joseph, children of his favored son, Ephraim, 
gathered "one of a city and two of a family," a few from the midst of 
the nations of the earth, whither they have been scattered, and brought 
to the land of Zion. The Lord has selected and picked them. They 
were chosen spirits before they were born. He knew them in the 
spirit world. He held them in reserve to come forth at the right time. 

GOD HAS GATHERED THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACE 

He has brought them to the right place. Joseph's blessings were 
to obtain above the blessings of his progenitors, even to the utmost 
bounds of the everlasting hills. It is no chance circumstance that we 
are here. Notwithstanding all the drivings, the sorrows and distresses, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



29 



at Nauvoo and Missouri, the difficulties in gathering the Saints from 
the Old World — these were but God's providences in gathering his 
people to the right place. 

I was deeply impressed with the statement made not long since 
by a man who has been gathering statistics of an eminent character, 
wherein he calls attention to the fact that while the United States is 
but seven percent of the world's land, and has but six percent of the 
world's population, nearly one-half of the world's natural wealth is in 
the United States of America. This surely is a choice land above all 
other lands. And then, as I thought of our habitations in these moun- 
tains, I feel a confidence in the statement that taking a survey two 
hundred miles from this city in either direction, and circumscribing a 
district within that radius, there may be found more natural wealth 
than in any other like territory in any other portion of this choice 
land. We are not only in the right nation, we are in the right part 
of that nation. 

I used to think about it while laboring as a missionary in the 
Northwest, for there was some thought, evidently, in the mind of 
the Prophet at one time that he might go to the northwest country, for 
he offered the services of the Latter-day Saint men to man the mili- 
tary posts along the old Oregon Trail. Tie said, "we can render this 
service cheaper than any one else since we expect to be in that country 
when we have concluded our service for the government." But the 
measure was defeated. You remember the discussion brought out the 
statement of Daniel Webster to this effect: "What do we want with 
this vast wilderness of shifting sands and cactus, prairie dogs, etc." 
He said he would not vote one dollar from the public treasury to bring 
the Pacific Coast one mile nearer Boston than it was at that time. 
And another senator said in the same discussion that he would not 
give a pinch of snuff for all the Rocky mountain country. And yet 
it was through the inspiration of the Almighty that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, almost at that time, said that the Saints would continue to 
suffer and be driven to these mountains, and many should live to see 
them become a mighty people. God's providence has been over the 
gathering of the Latter-day Saints to this place. This is yet the place 
. for the Latter-day Saints. 

HOW TO SECURE A PERMANENCY IN THE RIGHT PLACE 

A very significant thing is that as you read the history of the 
past, the peoples who have survived have been the owners of the soil 
and the tillers of the land, and the keepers of flocks. By natural 
inclination it is the occupation of the majority of the Latter-day Saints; 
indeed, it was the natural occupation of the majority of the children of 
Israel in ancient times, to be the tillers of the soil and the keepers of 
flocks. While you Latter-day Saint brethren on the farms have had 
a trying time, be ye patient and do not desert the very foundation of our 
independence in this country — the farm. Better days for you will 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



come if you can weather the storm, and you will preserve not only 
for yourselves but for the Church a permanency that is essential in 
working out this great problem. We are in the right place, and yet 
while this vast wealth may be here it is not easily accessible and can 
only be had with much labor, much patience and persistence. I doubt 
if there is another section in all the world that would call forth more 
physical strength, greater faith, patience and endurance, with a long- 
range vision of waiting and laboring to reach the destiny, than in 
these Rocky mountains. Lofty mountains, an inspiration! Clear 
streams of water, health-giving! Pure air, every setting is here to 
develop the finest physical race that has ever graced this footstool of 
God. The Lord brought the Latter-day Saints to the right place, and 
we are engaged in the right business to make us the kind of people 
the Lord wants us to be. 

THE RIGHT PLAN REVEALED TO GATHERED JOSEPH 

And then we have the plan revealed, as you heard this morning 
from our President, by the visitation of no less a personage than the 
Lord Jesus Christ himself. It is his plan, and it contemplates a solu- 
tion of every problem that now vexes this distressed world. The 
Lord saw the needs of this hour, 1924, more than a hundred years ago, 
and he provided for it a plan, and those who follow it shall survive, 
and those who do not accept the plan shall be shaken ; for this is a time 
when all that can be shaken will be shaken, and that shall stand which 
God has planned. I said that the plan contemplates a solution of all 
the problems that now vex us, and I am thinking of political prob- 
lems. I thought of it this morning as one of the brethren was speaking. 
I shall not be surprised if this shall be the last national campaign that 
we shall conduct in this country with the two great parties that have 
so long obtained here, arrayed one against the other. I tell you that 
the day is coming that the Prophet Joseph Smith predicted, when 
the Constitution shall be in peril, when it shall be necessary for the 
men of all parties who stand for the Constitution and law and order, 
to stand together, or this thing that we hold so sacred and dear, that 
our fathers established, cannot be preserved. Now the Latter-day 
Saints, by reason of the fact that they have been taught that God estab- 
lished the Constitution of the United States, adhere to it as earnestly 
and devotedly as to any other of our principles of faith and belief. 
By reason of the training we have received we are on the side of the 
Constitution,, on the side of law, on the side of order. In the training 
and discipline that has come to us in the keeping of the Word of Wis- 
dom, in the payment of our tithes and offerings, God was but prepar- 
ing us to meet the emergencies of this hour. It is his plan, and we 
shall succeed if we adhere to it being led successfully through all the 
difficulties; and directed safely to that goal and haven, our natural 
heritage, the realization of all these sacred promises that have been 
made by all the prophets since the world began. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



31 



HOWEVER WE MUST ADHERE TO OUR STANDARDS 

I tell you Latter-day Saints, however, that we need to adhere to 
our standards as never before in the history of this Church, because 
sin is rampant. Self-indulgence is the key word of the hour in the 
world, and I confess that I tremble and fear when I see the things 
that men boast of as the evidence of our high civilization, being really 
the very things that brought the ruin and the destruction of empires 
that have long since perished. I say it is a time when we need to 
adhere to our standards, to protect ourselves against the waves of sin 
and immorality that shall come in from the world. And yet I have no 
fear, if we shall be true to his plan for in it is our redemption and 
our salvation. 

WE HAVE AN INSPIRED INTERPERTER FOR THE PLAN 

I am grateful that we not only have the plan, but we have an 
inspired consulting engineer, an inspired man who can and does re- 
ceive from time to time, the word of the Lord for this people in 
interpreting that plan, so that we never come to difficulties in under- 
standing the plan. If we are in doubt, we know where to go, and we 
do receive the continual inspiration of the Lord for the government 
and guidance of his people. Behold, the plan is unfolding under the 
guidance of God's inspired servants. And each hour shall find God's 
provision adequate for that hour's need, if this people shall only -listen 
to the voice of the servants of the Lord, whom he has appointed to 
lead and guide and interpret his plan and purpose. Through obe- 
dience I am as sure as that I live that we shall see realized and ful- 
filled all of these wonderful things that the Lord has promised shall 
come. Though exiled, as many have been, driven from their homes, 
and much like Joseph, if not sold into Egypt, banished into the wilder- 
ness where it was thought they might perish, yet that which happened 
to Joseph shall yet happen to his Saints in latter days. Into the place 
God has led us, under the training he has given us, under the plan he 
has provided, he is preparing this people to become the saviors of 
the whole house of Israel, not to feed them physical bread, but the 
bread of life, that will be more essential and necessary for the world's 
salvation and preservation than any other kind of bread. These things 
I am as sure as that I live shall come. 

LET US KEEP THE GREAT VISION BEFORE US 

I pray God to bless us, that we shall keep the vision of it before 
us and be working towards it, and see in the practical things that we 
have been given in each of these commandments the Lord has revealed 
for the government and guidance of our own lives. It is after all a 
bigger thing than merely yielding obedience to the Lord's wishes ; for 
he must have had an object, and that object is to fit and prepare us 
to meet the emergencies of this hour, to succeed in weathering the 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



storms, and to come through — the salt of the earth, the light of the 
world ! The power to do it is here — not only the plan, but the power 
and right to execute it in the bestowal upon men of the holy Priesthood. 

God bless the Priesthood and his Church for the comfort and 
salvation of all flesh. May God speed the day that we shall be pre- 
pared to take those steps. The Lord is waiting for this people, and 
for the world to bring to pass his righteous purposes, and if we shall 
prepare ourselves, he is ready and willing to lead us to our glorious 
destiny ! May he grant it unto us who now live, if not in our day, 
in the day of our children, or our children's children — but it shall come ; 
whether to me, whether to you, I cannot say, but it will come to those 
who are true to the truth ! Many may fall away, lose the faith, but 
those who stand true and faithful shall be victorious, and they shall 
be the recipients of all these great things. God speed that day I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

( Of the First Council of Seventy ) 

When Abraham Lincoln was a child, residing in the wilds of 
Kentucky, his prayer was: "Lord, bless father, bless mother, bless 
sister, bless everybody. Teach me to read, and write. Watch over 
Honey and make him a good dog, and, Lord, keep us all from being 
lost in the wilderness." 

Lincoln himself, brought up under much the same circumstances 
as Joseph Smith the Prophet, so far as living in the wilderness was 
concerned, tells us that in his boyhood days there were many bears and 
other wild animals in the woods. No doubt he knew of his grand- 
father having met his death by an arrow shot by an Indian in ambush, 
and how his father, Thomas Lincoln, had avenged the death of his 
father. 

It is something to have a laudable ambition to learn to read and 
write ; but it was of the last verse, in the child's prayer, that I was 
going to speak — guidance in the wilderness, not only in the literal 
wilderness, in the woods, but also in other wildernesses in life that we 
encounter. The children of Israel received guidance in the wilderness, 
and they needed it, for we learn that although they might have dry 
passage across the Red Sea, although they might be guided by the 
pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, and have their 
thirst quenched by the water which flowed from the rock, at the touch 
of Moses' rod ; although they might be fed on manna, yet they were 
ready to engage in idol worship, framing the golden calf in imitation 
of Egyptian idolatry. Miriam, the sister of Moses, was outside of the

she brought upon herself by rebellion against her great law-giving

brother Moses, and ten of the chosen twelve who went down to spy 
out the land of promise were unworthy to live, notwithstanding their 
training in the wilderness. The Lord has been very good to those 
whom he has sent into the wilderness. Abraham, who was called 
from Ur, of the Chaldees, into a new land, was promised blessings 
and received them just as his posterity were promised blessings — bless- 
ings to Jacob, meaning, I suppose, his posterity whom the Lord found 
in the wilderness and led in the wilderness, and guided, and who were 
precious to him as the apple of his eye, so the scriptures inform us. 

And then there was the guidance of modern Israel in their wander- 
ings in the wilderness. And it isn't a bad training, these wilderness- 
instructing experiences that men may have, that the Latter-day Saints 
have had — guidance as they passed from the Missouri river to Utah, 
guidance no doubt to the citizen soldiers called the "Mormon" Battalion 
in their march through the wilderness, an event being celebrated by the 
State of Utah just now in the erection of a suitable monument, to cost 
some two hundred thousand dollars to properly commemorate the march 
in the wilderness and the behavior of these men upon that march. 

But as I said, it is not particularly of the guidance in the wilder- 
ness, the physical wilderness, that I wish to speak, although that is of 
importance, and we have experienced much of it, as indicated by the 
maps prepared by the Smithsonian Institute and exhibited in the north- 
west, showing the trail-blazing done by the Latter-day Saints from 
New York to Oregon, and also to Southern California. 

There are other wildernesses, as indicated by the remarks of the 
brethren this morning. We have the commercial wilderness, the fin- 
ancial wilderness, that men are groping in, and need guidance in, for 
them to devise ways and means that are honorable in the sight of all 
men for the support and education of their families. There is the 
intellectual wilderness in which there is danger of men losing their 
bearings. When I think of Abraham Lincoln having all together only 
twelve months of schooling, and that scattered over a period of nine 
years, and then of what a wonderful English scholar and philosopher 
he became, I think it is a reproach to some of the present generation 
who have such splendid opportunities for education and who make so 
little use of them. It takes our young people sometimes some months, 
or some years, to get their bearings again after they have gone through 
the education which is given to them by the current system of education 
that prevails in our land. If our educational system is what it should 
be, and our home training is what it should be, how comes it then that 
there is such lawlessness in the United States? Some one professing 
a knowledge of the statistics upon the subject has designated the 
United States as one of the most lawless nations in the world. If we 
can rear such characters as the prophet Joseph Smith and his brother 
Hyrum, and Abraham Lincoln, who^ was born only a little over three 
years after the prophet was born, by proper religious instruction in the 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



home and by divine guidance, then we may well pay greater attention 
to the things which will produce such men. 

I think it was a great slander upon Abraham Lincoln when his 
partner published that Lincoln was an infidel. I think nothing could 
be farther from the truth. In a large work entitled The Soul of 
Abraham Lincoln, written by one who carefully considered the sub- 
ject, proof is given that Abraham Lincoln was of a strongly religious 
nature. His own words as quoted by one of his biographers, Mr.. 
Holland, are as follows : 

"I know there is a God, and that he hates injustice and slavery. I see 
the storm coming, and I know that his hand is in it. If he has a place, a 
work for me — and I think he has — I believe I am ready. I am nothing, but 
truth is everything. I know I am right, because I know that liberty is right; 
for Christ teaches it, and Christ is God." 

If we would have the sort of a world that the author would have, 
who was quoted by Brother Widtsoe this morning — a dose of atheism 
— we would have the sort of a world pictured by Carlyle in one of his 
chapters entitled, "The Everlasting No," in which he uses this language • 

"Thus has the bewildered wanderer to stand, as so many have done, 
shouting question after question into the sibyl cave of destiny and receive 
no answer back but an echo. It is all a grim desert, this once fair world 
of his, wherein is heard only the howl of wild beasts, or the shriek of 
despairing, hate-filled men; and no pillar of cloud by day and no pillar of 
fire by night any longer guides the pilgrim * * * The whole world is 
like thee, sold to unbelief, their old temples of the Godhead which for long 
has not been rainproof, crumble down, and we ask now, 'Where is the God- 
head ? Our eyes never see him.' " 

A doubt-filled world is the picture given, where no faith exists 
and where atheism prevails. 

The explanation of attributing infidelity to Lincoln is given 
by the author of the book, The Soul of Abraham Lincoln. He suggests 
that it was the contention of the different denominations, many of 
which were mentioned this morning by Elder Whitney, that may 
have distracted Abraham Lincoln, just as we know at about the same 
time it distracted the Prophet Joseph Smith and led him to prayer and 
to the truth. 

I am very grateful to the Lord for his guidance to the pioneers in 
their wanderings in the wilderness, and in their settlements in the 
valley, and that the great landmarks have been given to us for our 
educational system, and for our theological learning and religious train- 
ing. We are in the happy position of being able to sail between the two 
extremes of the fundamentalist and the modernist, being able to sail be- 
tween Scylla and Charybdis, so to speak, without striking the rock on 
the one hand, or being drawn into the whirlpool on the other. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to appreciate all that the 
restoration of the gospel means to us, and all that the guidance by the 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



35 



Priesthood has meant to us and to our fathers, and will mean to our 
prosterity, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

"I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me, 
Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me, 
I tremble to know that for me he was crucified, 
That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died. 

"I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine, 
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine; 
That he should extend his great love unto such as I, 
Sufficient to own, to redeem and to justify. 

"I think of his hands, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt; 
Such mercy, such love and devotion, can I forget? 
No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy-seat, 
Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet. 

"Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me, 

Enough to die for me ! 

Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me !" 

Last Wednesday morning I had the great pleasure of speaking 
to the temple workers, and this song was sung by two of the sisters. 
Perhaps it was the surroundings, perhaps it was the sweet voices, but I 
never before heard it when it impressed me so ; and I thought to myself 
how wonderful ! how wonderful ! And that expression may be made 
by any member of this Church when contemplating the work of God, 
beginning with the creation of the world, for it was wonderful. The 
great plan of the Father, the plan of life and death is all wonderful ; 
and it seems to me that a man must have lost all devotion, all respect 
for power on earth or in heaven when he takes the position that there is 
no God, that we come to this earth by chance, that the earth was 
created by chance, and then that we are here the same as any other life, 
be it plant or animal. I cannot understand any man whose thoughts 
run in that channel. 

Then how wonderful is the regulation of the universe, causing 
the seasons to come and go. Mankind can depend upon them, but 
man has no influence over them ; all is directed by a higher Power. 

I often think of the organization of the Church ; how wonderful 
it is ! It was referred to this morning as being compared with the 
great German army, when Germany had an army. There is no such 
comparison, for one is of man, the other of God. One was organized 
for destruction of life, the other organized for the salvation of men's 
souls. I feel grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the plan of life and 
salvation. I never forget to thank my heavenly Father that I was born 
a member of the Church. I never forget to thank him that that birth 
came through a mother and a father who have acknowledged hirri as 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the King of kings and Lord of lords, and had a testimony that "Mor- 
monism," if you please, is his divine Church. I never forget to thank 
him that I was born under the holy covenant, and I know as I know I 
live, it has had a great influence upon me in my every walk of life. 
I care not what it may be, business of any name or nature, things 
pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ, I acknowledge to my heavenly 
Father that I have been benefited more perhaps than I am entitled to 
by having been born under the everlasting covenant. 

What a wonderful thing is this government of ours ! How blessed 
are we that we live under a form of government such as ours. I am 
one who believes that there is no other form of government in all the 
world in which "Mormonism," so-called, could have been established. 
The religious liberties granted are necessary for the people to live the 
gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness. It required just such a form of 
government as ours. And when I see, as I think I see, the least move 
upon the part of men claiming to be citizens of this government to 
destroy the very foundations upon which it stands, to cut from the 
Constitution of the United States, that which gives and is the bulwark 
of our liberty, 1 feel that every man and every woman should lift their 
voices, if necessary cry aloud, against any such action upon the part 
of any clique or group of people. I thank God for America. I thank 
him that I was born under the Stars and Stripes. I thank him for the 
Constitution of the United States. I thank him for the laws and for the 
institutions created under the Constitution of the United States; and 
I shall continue to pray with all the fervor at my command to the over- 
ruling God of nations in the world to preserve the Constitution of our 
country, to preserve our country from those without and from those 
within : America, the most blessed of all lands in the world. 

Brother Ballard just referred to the fact that nearly one-half of 
all the natural resources of the world are found in our America, held, 
as I have often said, in the hollow of God's hand for ages, that liberty 
may be planted here and a free government established, that would 
be an ensample to all other governments of the earth. When I see 
that there is the least inclination on the part of any one to destroy 
even a part of the Constitution of the United States, II shall bitterly 
oppose it. I have no reference now to the few amendments to the 
Constitution that have been made, they were incidental to the great 
document itself, and to the principles upon which it was founded. When 
it comes to destroying the fundamentals, then action must be taken, 
and the only action that can be taken, is by the people themselves. 
Power is in your hands, the power is with the people of the country, 
and I trust, as I believe with all my soul, that the opposition will never 
be successful, and the Constitution will remain intact in its funda- 
mentals forever. 

My brethren and sisters, of all the blessings that I have received 
from our heavenly Father, and they are many, and I acknowledge them, 
there are none so dear to me as the fact that I know that Jesus is 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



37 



the Christ and that God lives, the fact that I am a member of his 
Church, that I know it was organized by revelation, that it is a power 
for good in the world, that if the principles of the gospel were acknowl- 
edged and adhered to by the peoples of the world, this world of ours 
would be a better place for God's children to live in. "Oh, the sweet 
joy this sentence gives : I know that my Redeemer lives." God bless 
his work, God bless his people. May our heavenly Father watch 
over our nation, that it may have a powerful influence with all other 
nations of the world, making them better places for people to live in. 
Hasten the day when the gospel shall be preached to all the peoples of 
the earth. Hasten the day, O Father, when thy work will be under- 
stood by the peoples of the world, and the honest in heart, wherever they 
may be, will acknowledge the truth of the same. God grant it, I 
ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

If we can say that during this conference the principle of man's 
pre-existence has been established by scriptural proof, we can also 
say that the principle of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of 
man has been proved. 

THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST ORIGINATED IN HEAVEN 

Understanding the true relationship of man to his Maker, we 
are better able to appreciate the scriptural reference to the love the 
Father has for his children. We read that, "God so loved the world, 
that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him 
should not perish, but have everlasting life." In this scripture we 
learn that God so loved his children that he made provision for their 
salvation. This is the end our Father has in view. All else is but a 
means to this end. The Prophet Joseph Smith has left of record this 
statement, "At the first organization in heaven, we were all present 
and saw the Savior chosen and appointed, and the plan of salvation 
made, and we sanctioned it." The truth of his statement is fully sus- 
tained by scriptural proof. It is clear that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
had its origin in heaven before the world was. "We believe that 
through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obe- 
dience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel." 

THE RESTORATION OF THE GOSPEL 

The gospel has been upon the earth at different periods of the 
world's history. After the death of the Savior and his disciples there 
was a general departure from the truth, so that when Joseph Smith 
had his vision of the Father and the Son, he was told that the churches 
were all wrong and that he should join none of them. He was 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



informed by an angel from heaven that God had a work for him to do, 
and that his name should be had for good and evil among all nations. 
By the gift and power of God unto him, Joseph Smith has given unto 
the world the Book of Mormon which gives an account of the former 
inhabitants of this American continent, and contains the fulness of 
the everlasting gospel as given by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants. 
Other angels appeared to him and conferred upon him the Priesthood, 
with power and authority to establish the Church of Jesus Christ 
upon the earth, and to preach the gospel in all the world, administering 
the ordinances of salvation to those who are prepared to receive them. 
Thus the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has been restored to earth 
in these last days, line upon line, and precept upon precept, in ful- 
filment of the holy scriptures, with authority, keys, powers, gifts and 
blessings, the same as were in the primitive Church. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 

It is our responsibility to preach this gospel of the kingdom in all 
the world for a witness unto all nations before the end shall come. It 
is the responsibility of the world to accept the message which we have 
for them. To them it becomes as a savor of life unto life or of death 
unto death. On this point I will read to you from the Book of Mor- 
mon as follows : 

"Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they harden their 
hearts against the Lamb of God. For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of 
God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the children 
of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on 
the other — either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or 
unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blind- 
ness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also 
into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the cap- 
tivity of the devil, of which I have spoken." — I Nephi 14:6, 7. 

MANY LACK COURAGE TO JOIN THE CHURCH 

There are thousands of people within the stakes of Zion, and in 
the world, who have become convinced of the truth of "Mormonism" 
but who, for one cause or another, have not become members of the 
Church. 

A short time ago, I heard of a man joining the Church who had 
lived among our people for nearly forty ye&rs. He stated to some of 
his friends that he had for many years been a "Mormon" at heart. 
When asked why he had not earlier joined the Church, his reply was 
that he lacked the courage. This represents a class of which there 
are many. Some who believe do not join because of the cost, others 
because of what people would think and say, and still others because 
the standards of the Church are too high. 

Some years ago while in England I was visiting a family of 
Saints, and an elderly sister was telling me how she, and her hus- 
band recently deceased, had, during his life time, entertained a great 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



39 



many Latter-day Saint missionaries. I asked how she accounted for 
the fact that under such circumstances her husband had never joined 
the Church. Her reply was that he had never been invited to join. I 
wonder if there are those among us who are Latter-day Saints at heart 
but are waiting for an invitation to become members. We invite all 
men to repent <and yield obedience unto the laws and ordinances of 
the gospel that the atoning blood of our Savior may wash them clean 
and prepare them for salvation. 

QUALIFICATIONS FOR BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH 

As qualifications for baptism into the Church, I will read to you 
a paragraph from the Doctrine and Covenants as follows: 

"And again, by way of commandment to the Church concerning the 
manner of baptism — All those who humble themselves before God, and 
desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, 
and witness before the Church that they have truly repented of all their 
sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a 
determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works 
that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their 
sins, shall be received by baptism into the Church." 

The gospel is the law of life as lived by the Savior. It made him 
what he was and is, and it is designed to make us like him and to save 
us with him. It is the highest possible standard of life — the straight 
gate and the narrow way. 

When the rich young man came to' the Savior and asked what 
good thing he might do that he might have eternal life, he was told 
to go sell what he had, and give to the poor, and come follow him of 
whom it was said that he had nowhere to lay his head. We are told 
that the rich man went away sorrowful ; and the Savior said : "A rich 
<■ man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven." On another 
occasion the Savior made use of this expression: "So likewise, who- 
soever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be 
my disciple." 

Those who embrace the gospel have as their object the obtaining 
of eternal life, which is the greatest gift of God to man. No sacri- 
fice should be considered too great in order to attain eternal life, and 
there is no other way to obtain it. 

THE SPEAKER'S TESTIMONY 

As a witness for the Lord, I testify that God the eternal Father 
lives, an immortal and glorified being, after whose image and likeness 
man is created and made, male and female, being born sons and daughters 
of God. He is a being having a body of flesh and bones and spirit. 
He has created all things through his Son Jesus Christ. The earth is 
his, and the fulness thereof, and all blessings, spiritual and temporal, 
come from him. 

I also testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God the eternal 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Father, that he is the first born of the Father in the spirit, and the 
Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, that he is the Savior and 
Redeemer of the world, that he was scourged and crucified, and that 
he died and was resurrected and ascended to heaven where he sits 
upon the throne of the Father at his right hand in glory. I know that 
my Redeemer lives. 

I bear testimony also that I do know that Joseph Smith, the 
founder of this work, was a divinely inspired prophet of God, and 
that those who have succeeded to the Presidency of this Church, each 
in his time, has been inspired of the Lord for his particular work and 
responsibility; that President Heber J. Grant, no less than his pre- 
decessors, is inspired of the Lord, and under his presidency the work 
is prospering and is becoming more and more a marvel and a wonder 
to the world. It is the work of God and not the work of man, and 
no power can stay its progress. The purposes of the Almighty will 
be accomplished, and all who will, shall be saved, and all honor be 
to the Father through his son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Redeemer. 
Amen. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I hope I may enjoy the favor of the Lord while I stand before 
you here this day. I rejoice in the testimony of the gospel that has 
been restored to the earth through the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

When Nephi, one of the ancient prophets, began his historical 
record he used these words by way of introduction: "Having been 
born of goodly parents," and thereby he made it plain that he honored 
his parents — his father and his mother. He deemed it a blessing to 
him that he had thus been favorably born into this world. And I 
wonder how far the sons and daughters of Zion appreciate the won- 
derful advantage that has come to them by having been born of goodly 
(parents. 

In the Young Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement 
Association they have adopted as their slogan for this year the com- 
mandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother." To what extent are 
the children of the Latter-day Saints obeying that commandment, that 
commandment which God wrote with his own finger upon the tablets 
of stone, and which was delivered by the prophet Moses unto the chil- 
dren of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, the son of Isaac who was the 
son of Abraham — the children of Israel, whom God loved and desig- 
nated as his very own, the chosen people of God? We, who have 
embraced the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ are the children of 
Abraham. What a splendid heritage and advantage it is to come 
through that noble lineage. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



41 



How do we know that we are of Israel ? It is the blood of Israel 
that recognizes the voice of the true Shepherd : "My sheep hear my 
voice and follow after me but a stranger they will not follow," said 
the Savior of old. It has been declared by the Prophets of God, it has 
been sealed upon our heads by the patriarchs when we received our 
patriarchal blessings. Our lineage has been declared by the inspiration 
of the Lord to his servants the Patriarchs, and that we have believed 
in the gospel is further evidence of that fact. Why should the 
believers come through that lineage? I believe with all my soul that 
in our pre-existent state we were chosen to come through that lineage 
because of our fidelity in the world before this one, in our first estate, 
and the advantages that have come to us, who have accepted the word 
of the Lord and who have received the testimony of the truth of the 
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, have come to us because of our 
fidelity and faithfulness to the will of God before the foundations of 
this earth were laid. Abraham was among the great and mighty ones 
in that primeval day, when the great plan of life and salvation was first 
proclaimed to the children of God, the day that we read about in the 
scriptures, "when the stars sang together, and all the sons of God 
shouted for joy." 

It is to that day that I now refer, when Abraham was known to 
God as one of the great and noble ones; and when he came upon the 
earth the Lord still loved him and gave him a marvelous promise, 
and told him that through him and his seed all the nations of the earth 
should be blessed. We now live in a day when the descendants of 
that great patriarch are being gathered into the fold of Christ. We 
belong to one of the branches of that great family. Abraham had a 
son who was a son of promise, Isaac. Isaac had a son whom they 
called Jacob, and Jacob's name was changed to Israel, and from him 
came the twelve tribes of Israel. One of these tribes was the tribe of 
Joseph. It is through this lineage that the Latter-day Saints have 
come. Do we appreciate the wonderful privilege that comes to us 
by having been born of these goodly parents, that we have inherited 
from them that faith that enables us to accept the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ? No matter to what extent that posterity may have been 
scattered throughout the nations of the earth, it is through this lineage 
that the truth shall be accepted and preserved and heralded in the earth. 
It has been through that lineage that the scriptures have been handed 
down from generation to generation, that the knowledge of the true 
and living God has been preserved among mankind, land it is through 
that lineage that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ shall be promul- 
gated among all the nations of the earth, and every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people shall be blessed through the seed of Abraham in 
fulfilment of the promise that was made by God unto that great man. 
I hope it will not sound egotistical if I declare, in the language of the 
poet, that indeed 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"We are the true-born sons of Ephraim, 
Who, with us, that can compare? 
We are of the royal house of Joseph, 
That bright and glorious morning star." 

This is our declaration, and we have been sounding it for miany 
years past. It is written in our very souls. The House of Israel is 
being gathered from the nations of the earth, and we, being the chil- 
dren of Abraham, have a wonderful obligation resting upon us to 
see that all nations are blessed through our being and coming of these 
goodly parents. It should, however, be remembered that God is no 
respecter of persons and therefore the gospel must be preached to every 
creature and those that believe and obey it shall be saved and further- 
more those who reject it, even though they may be of Israel's blood, 
will surely have to take the consequences. 

I rejoice today that I have been born of goodly parents, that I 
have been born under the new and everlasting covenant. I rejoice 
in the work that is being accomplished by the Latter-day Saints in the 
building of these great temples wherein work may be performed for 
the living and for the dead; and while I remember those who imme- 
diately are responsible for my birth upon this earth, my heart goes back 
throughout the generations that have passed, and gone, until I con- 
nect and link myself up with the great household of God through 
Abraham his servant, and I believe with all my soul that there must 
be a welding link between each of us and those that have gone before 
until we shall indeed become members of that wonderful family that 
was chosen in that primeval day to come through his lineage, through 
the lineage of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is the heritage of the 
Latter-day Saints, and our destiny is to fulfil these obligations, to 
carry the gospel to all the inhabitants of the earth, that they mlay 
hear the truth, and that the honest in heart among every nation shall 
be gathered into the fold of Christ and brought under the new and 
everlasting covenant which is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that the 
family may be united in that welding link that shall connect us, for 
without them we cannot be saved, and without us neither can they be 
saved ; and it is essential that this work shall go on. For what man or 
what woman would rejoice or be happy if he could not be associated 
with his own kindred ? What man or what woman would feel that 
he was enjoying a blessing in the world to come if it were not in the 
association of his father and his mother? What parent could possibly 
feel that heaven would be heaven to him unless he could be associated 
there with his own children? What is true of these immediate con- 
nections is true of those that have gone on before. Our fathers and 
our mothers would never be happy nor f eel that they could be exalted 
and saved in the kingdom of God unless they could be associated with 
their fathers and their mothers. And so it will be until we connect 
ourselves and reunite in that one great family, the family of God, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

united together with that welding link under the new and everlasting 
covenant. 

May we appreciate our heritage and the blessings that have come 
to us by having been born of these goodly parents, I humbly pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The audience has no doubt noticed the absence of President Charles 
W. Penrose. Brother Penrose was taken very sick a little over a week 
ago, but I am pleased to announce that he is very much better, that he 
intended to come here today, but we felt it was much better for him to 
n:st today and tomorrow, and we hope that he may be with us on 
Sunday. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

Benediction was pronounced by M. Howard Randall, president 
of the Morgan stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., Saturday. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

Promptly at 10 o'clock Saturday, October 4, 1924, President Heber 
J. Grant opened the meeting by announcing that the congregation would 
sing, "High on the mountain top." 

After singing, Elder William M. Waddoups, President of the Ha- 
waiian Temple, offered the opening prayer. 

Eva Aird sang a solo entitled, "The Hour of Hallowed Peace." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Truly those who are assembled in this house this morning have 
reason to be grateful for the blessings by which we are surrounded. 
A more beautiful morning could hardly be desired, and the weather 
conditions are so delightful, that we must all feel uplifted. The privilege 
we have of meeting our friends from all parts of the Church is a 
blessing that I am sure is greatly appreciated. 

OUR DUTY TO ASSIST IN PERPETUATING LIBERTY 

In this day when strife is everywhere apparent, when there is 
contention between individuals of various parties, it is pleasing to me 
as a member of the Church to know that our heavenly Father is inter- 
ested in us, and in our government. We are fortunate in having our 
agency. The Lord has blessed each of us with intellect and has of- 
fered to direct our thoughts if we will approach him in a proper manner. 
The mind of man is affected by good and by evil influences, and there 
are in the world those two powers that have been active from the begin- 
ning. Knowing that we may be directed by proper influences as 
members of this great Church, and as citizens of this wonderful govern- 
ment, surely we will not depart from the advice and counsel of our 
heavenly Father and follow those teachings that will lead us to des- 
truction. Knowing that the Lord prepared this land that it might be 
a haven of liberty for those who dwell here, and understanding that he 
desires a continuation of those conditions that the builders of this 
republic contended for, we who are members of his Church ought, in 
every possible way, to assist in perpetuating that liberty that means so 
much for the children of men. 

THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OF THE LAND TO BE SUPPORTED 

We find in the Doctrine and Covenants that the Lord gave to his 
people a revelation on August 6, 1833, (Doc. and Cov. 98.) That 
seems to me has a bearing on conditions as they exist in our country 
today : 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

"Verily I say unto you my friends,. fear not, let your hearts be comforted; 
yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything- give thanks; 

"Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into 
the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testa- 
ment — the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted. 

"Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable cove- 
nant that they shall be fulfiled; and all things wherewith you have been 
afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith 
the Lord." 

When that revelation was given, our people were being harassed 
and annoyed by those who did not accept the revelations of the Lord 
to us, and their lives were made almost intolerable by their fellow 
citizens, but they claimed the blessings of our heavenly Father, and in 
this revelation he assured them that their prayers had been answered, 
and that the fulfilment of his promise to them for their faithfulness 
would be certain. They at that time were living at Kirtland, Ohio, 
where the first temple was erected in this dispensation, to the glory 
of our heavenly Father. He said to them regarding the laws of the 
land : 

"And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is 
my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I com- 
mand them. 

"And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that prin- 
ciple of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, 
and is justifiable before me. 

"Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my Church, 
in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land; 

"And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this 
comcth of evil." 

In other words, if we fail to sustain the constitutional law of the 
land we have transgressed the will of our heavenly Father. 

"I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and 
the law also maketh you free. 

"Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. 

"Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, 
and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise what- 
soever is less than these Cometh of evil." 

WE SHOULD. NOT BE LED A STRAY BY FALLACIES 

In these days of confusion, when the Constitution of our country 
is assailed, by those who have no understanding of the purpose of 
God regarding this great country, it behooves those who do under- 
stand to consider seriously and faithfully, the benefits that will flow 
to us by honoring and sustaining the government that was reared 
under the direction of our heavenly Father. 

We are a peculiar people in many ways, and in this particularly 
are we peculiar, in that we believe that the constitution of the United 
States was inspired by our heavenly Father, and he has told us that 
he raised up the very men who should frame the Constitution of the 
United States. Knowing that, we should not be led astray by the 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fallacies of individuals whose selfishness inclines them to attack that 
which our heavenly Father has prepared for the people of this land. 

A DECLARATION OF BELIEF REGARDING GOVERNMENTS AND 
LAWS IN GENERAL 

In a very early day in the Church our people promulgated their 
attitude with reference to the law of the land and the purpose of govern- 
ment. I believe I will take time this morning to read it to you. It is 
found in the Doc. and Cov., sec. 134; and in the History of the Church, 
Vol. 2, p. 247: 

"A declaration of belief regarding governments and laws in general, 
adopted by a unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835, with 
the following preamble: That our belief with regard to earthly govern- 
ments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood, 
we have thought proper to present at the close of this volume our opinion 
concerning the same." 

And this, is what our people subscribed to in conference assembled : 

"We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of 
man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, 
both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of 
society. 

"We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws 
are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free 
exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection 
of life. 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and 
magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer 
the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice 
of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. 

"We believe that religion is instituted of God: and that men are amen- 
able to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious 
opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; 
but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in pre- 
scribing rtiles of worship to bind the conscience of men, nor dictate forms 
for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain 
crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress 
the freedom of the soul. 

"We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective 
governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and 
inalienable rights by the laws of such governments: and that sedition and 
rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be pun- 
ished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws 
as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at 
the same time, however, holding' sacred the freedom of conscience. 

"We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and 
magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the 
punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and 
deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by 
anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of 
regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; 
and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for 
faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker. 

"We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



47 



bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise 
of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in 
justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, 
so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious 
opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy. 

"We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according 
to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the 
breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according 
to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that 
government in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and 
tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing 
offenders against good laws to punishment. 

"We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil 
government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed 
in its spiritual privileges, and the individtial rights of its members, as citizens, 
denied. 

"We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their 
members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of 
such societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good stand- 
ing; but we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try 
men on the right of property or life, to take from them this world's goods, 
or to put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical 
punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their 
society, and withdraw from them their fellowship. 

"We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all 
wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of prop- 
erty or character infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but 
we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, 
and property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroach- 
ments of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot 
be made to the laws, and relief afforded. 

"We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, 
and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the 
world; but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither 
preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their 
masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to 
be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the 
lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and 
dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be 
held in servitude." 

NO ONE A GOOD MEMBER OF THE CHURCH WHO REFUSES 
TO SUSTAIN THE LAW OF THE LAND 

I felt that on this occasion, and at this time, when there is so 
much unrest in our land, that I would like to read to you what our 
people conceived to be their duty to the government under which they 
lived. We still believe that there is only one way whereby we may 
enjoy peace and happiness, and that is by observing the constitu- 
tional law of our land, and by sustaining that constitutional law 
that was inspired by our heavenly Father at the inception of this 
great government. There are those who are misguided in the belief 
that they may organize groups and take into their own hands the punish- 
ment of those who have differed from them in their ideas of religion 
or government. We may well understand that men who do that come 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in conflict with the orderly system that our heavenly Father has de- 
creed should govern the children of men. So, as Latter-day Saints 
in these times of unrest we may know that no man is a faithful member 
of this Church, in good standing, who refuses to sustain the law of the 
land, and who lends himself in any way to break down that organized 
system of laws that has been prepared for the good of the com- 
munity. The Lord directs that we seek after good men and great men, 
and that we pray for and sustain them in order that the laws that are 
enacted for our government may be such as he would be pleased to 
indorse. This people may go on exercising a power for the blessing 
of the children of men in this land that will be felt from shore to shore, 
and from border line to border line. I am grateful that I belong to a 
Church that has been directed by our heavenly Father to observe 
the constitutional law of the land. I am grateful that those men who 
have led this Church have been inspired by the Lord to teach obedience 
to law. I am thankful that on the eve of a great election, when we 
are to choose those who will preside over the destinies of the nation 
and the states, that we have the word of our heavenly Father that we 
should select good men, and honorable men, and that the franchise 
that we are blessed with shall be exercised in the interest of orderly 
government, and in the interest of the perpetuation of a system of 
laws that shall continue peace and contentment and satisfaction to all 
who dwell in this land. 

THANKFUL FOR THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY 

This is God's work that we are identified with. He has established 
his Church in this latter day. He has blessed us with the opportunity 
to seek him in prayer, and, if we are humble, he will lead us to do 
those things that will make for righteousness and for contentment in 
life. Today, let us feel as we go from this delightful conference that we 
will draw near unto the Lord, that we will honor him and honor the 
Government that he has prepared for us, under which we live and in 
which he have part in protecting. 

This Church is our Father's work. It is the advocate of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and this government is established by the will of Jesus 
Christ and is a part of his plan whereby men may enjoy liberty 
and freedom, and where all faiths and beliefs and doctrines may enjoy 
liberty and be amenable to the law of the land ; and where no group of 
individuals may array themselves against the rights and privileges 
of their fellows. I thank my Father in heaven, for the knowledge 
that he loves liberty. I thank him for the blessings that he has given 
to us of peace and happiness in these everlasting hills. I am grateful 
for my companionship with men and women such as are assembled here 
today, and such as you represent throughout this great land. That the 
Lord may help us that we may be worthy of our birthright, that we 
may live such pure and holy lives that the adversary will have no power

to tempt us, or direct us into evil paths, and that we may listen to the 
whisperings of that still small voice, to which all good men are en- 
titled, and know that voice when it shall come to us, for it will point us 
the way of peace and happiness and eternal life, is my prayer, and that 
God may grant it to us all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church 

I have listened with a great deal of pleasure and appreciation to 
the remarks that have been made yesterday and today. They have 
been a source of joy to my soul, and I appreciate most sincerely this 
opportunity of being present to listen to the words of life, of counsel, 
and of advice that have been given already and will yet be given during 
this conference. 

This vast congregation is unique. It is composed not of delegates 
whose expenses have been paid by organizations that they might come 
to attend these sessions, but is made up of Latter-day Saints who of 
their own free will have assembled in this great building for the pur- 
pose of worshiping God and for the purpose of being blessed and 
inspired by truth and a fuller understanding of the Gospel. They 
have assembled from places all the way between Canada and Mexico, 
as far southeast as Georgia, northeast up to New York and vicinity, 
from Chicago and from such western states as California, and from 
points as far west as the Hawaiian Islands. They have gathered here 
for the purpose of listening to words of inspiration and of being 
encouraged in their holy faith. So. in that respect, this gathering is 
unique ; and I am thankful and glad that I am privileged to be one 
who is here. 

While Brother George Albert Smith was speaking I thought to 
myself, "What more am I thankful for than those things which he 
has expressed this morning?" I am thankful, as I believe we all are, 
for the blessings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; for the kind and tender 
mercy of our Father in heaven in giving us the privilege in these latter 
days of hearing and embracing the truth, as revealed from our heavenly 
Father to his servant the Prophet Joseph. I am thankful, and I think 
that we all are thankful, for this goodly land, for this land choice 
above all other lands, protected by two mighty oceans from Old World 
hatreds and feuds, this land where there can be developed the highest 
civilization the world has yet seen. I am thankful that the Lord has 
so abundantly blessed his people. Though adversity brought that Pio- 
neer band here, he himself placed them in the center of this great 
country, in the valleys of these great mountain ranges, where wealth 
and peace and comfort prevail ; and how different we find the world 
to be when we leave these vales and these peaceful towns and villages 
of the Latter-day Saints, and how glad we are to get back again. I 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



am thankful that the Lord has reserved this land as the place in which 
his mighty purposes were to be brought about, that the Gospel was 
restored in a land where liberty prevails. These happenings were not 
haphazard ; they did not come by chance. The Prophet Nephi saw in 
vision the very man who would discover this land and prepare the 
way for the coming of the great stream of the House of Israel into 
this country, which has been occupied, and is still being occupied and 
deve'oped, by that mighty race of Israelites scattered as they were 
years ago, and remaining so until the sound of the Gospel message 
came to them. 

I am thankful, too, for the peace that prevails among us as Lat- 
ter-day Saints ; for the happiness and comfort which abide about us ; 
for the well-fed and well-clothed people; for the comfortable homes 
and beautiful surroundings of the farms and the property which the 
Lord has permitted us to acquire that we might use it to his honor 
and glory. It was with joy, too. that I heard this morning the reading 
of the statement made by the Prophet Joseph concerning our rights 
and privileges ; and I am thankful that among the fruits of the Gospel 
is the demonstration that people can live in harmony and in peace. 
While one Latter-day Saint committing a felony would be one too 
many, yet there is no community in this world where less crime is 
committed and where there is less need for courts of justice and order 
than in the communities where our people are thickly settled. Such 
are the results of obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I am 
indeed thankful for it. 

Another thought concerning the progress and development of the 
work of God : The Lord has given us the light of the Gospel, and a 
part of the responsibility of continuing his great work rests upon us. 
As I said to Bishop Nibley this morning, the Lord has placed upon the 
Latter-day Saints three great duties. One is that they shall save them- 
selves ; another, that they shall warn the world : and the third, that 
they shall redeem their dead ; and nearly all we do in this Church is 
fundamentally based on one or more of these three propositions. 

I have been thinking concerning our personal salvation, the de- 
velopment of our spiritual life, increased devotion to duty in our wards 
and stakes, the higher and better family life; for after all family life 
is the basis of all the development of this Church. We are an aggre- 
gate of families organized into branches and wards and stakes and 
missions, and we need development in the home, the basis of all our 
growth and improvement. I would like to see scripture reading in 
the homes, and family prayers carefully attended to, that the spirit 
and idealism of the Gospel of Jesus Christ might be instilled into us 
in the home, for that is where we will save ourselves and our children. 
In this Church the Lord has placed the priesthood to act as his agents, 
that whatever they perform, in righteousness and under the proper di- 
rection, will be binding on this earth and in the heavens. This priest- 
hood has been graded into various orders, each with very specific and 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



51 



well-defined duties, and the Lord called and appointed two of the 
orders of this priesthood for the very purpose of looking- after the 
home life of the community. The Lord shows this in Section 20, that 
famous and wonderful revelation given a short time before the Church 
was organized, and he placed upon the priests and teachers these duties : 

"The priest's duty is to preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and 
administer the sacrament, 

"And visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally 
and in secret and attend to all family (duties. * * * 

"The teacher's duty is to watch over the church always, and be with and 
strengthen them: 

"And see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with 
each other, neither lying, back-biting, nor evil speaking; 

"And. see that the church meet together often, and also see that all 
members do their duty." 

The Lord did not intend that it should be left entirely with the 
priests and teachers. In section 107, he says : 

"High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right 
to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the presidency, in 
administering spiritual things, and also in the office of an elder, priest (of 
the Levitical order), teacher, deacon, and member." 

So, it is plain that the Lord has placed some responsibility upon 
every Latter-day Saint holding the Priesthood, and one of the greatest 
of these responsibilities I have just mentioned, that of developing the 
spiritual life of the Latter-day Saints ; and it is a privilege to be called 
by the bishopric of a ward to labor in the ministry over a few families, 
to visit with them, to teach them, as the Lord says, and to be their 
counselors. It is an oportunity that comes to but few. It is the only 
organization in the Church by which the Lord has provided that 
those laboring in it shall go into the homes and teach the Saints their 
duties. I believe, my brethren and sisters, that we should take seriously 
our duties in this respect, feeling the weight of responsibility and real- 
izing that the spiritual development of this Church, the upbuilding of 
family life, and the guiding and training of the youth of Zion depend 
so largely on the twenty thousand men and boys who are laboring in 
the ministry as Ward Teachers. 

I believe the time has come when the young men called to hold 
the offices of priest and teacher should accompany older men. and I 
believe that these older men should be responsible for the spiritual 
training of the boys placed in their charge. This reminds me of the 
incident I have heard our President tell concerning that rugged Scotch- 
man, Hamilton G. Park, a man whom I loved and revered, for I lived 
in the same stake as did he and learned to know and appreciate him. 
President Grant was called to labor as a teacher with Brother Park, 
and the President has often told of the times they have gone visiting to- 
gether to the homes of the Saints in the Twelfth-Thirteenth ward, of the 
inspiration and encouragement he has received from that staunch Lat- 
ter-day Saint who never deviated from his duty, Hamilton G. Park. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That same opportunity of helping to train the youth of Zion comes 
to you and to me, my brethren and sisters. I believe we would be" 
derelict in our duty if, when young boys are called to labor with us 
older men, we did not instil into their hearts by testimony, by good 
conduct, by righteous living, a love of the Gospel, and a love of truth, 
so that they will be able to say, as President Grant has said about 
Hamilton G. Park, that we have been a source of encouragement and 
inspiration to them. 

I believe that the development of this Church in the stakes and 
wards will evolve largely around the home. You remember that a 
lawyer sent to the Lord at one time and said to him : "Master, which 
is the great commandment in the law ?" and the Lord told him : "Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all. thy soul, 
and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And 
the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 
There must grow among the Latter-day Saints a greater love and spirit 
of neighborliness among us ; a co-operative spirit, with a desire to 
help one another in commercial and in other forms of business life ; 
a willingness to be kind and considerate and helpful to our neighbors. 
This spirit prevails among us to a greater degree than anywhere else 
in the world. Every Latter-day Saint has need for the faith and help 
of his neighbors. Their lives and our lives will be benefited by their 
good conduct and by ours. 

So I appeal to my brethren and sisters that we go home with the 
determination that our home life shall improve where necessary ; that 
our spiritual life shall be developed through laboring in the ministry ; 
that we will serve the Lord with all our hearts, with all our might, 
with all our minds, and with all our strength, that his great work may 
,grow, that it may never be said of us that if we had been better men and 
women the work of the Lord might have progressed just a little faster. 

The Lord bless you and me and help us to appreciate the oppor- 
tunities of today. The Lord bless us with a desire that we make the 
best use of today. Yesterday has gone ; tomorrow we may never see. 
May we grasp our opportunities and make the most of them, so that 
our Father may say to us, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant : 
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over 
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The Lord bless 
us, and help us to keep these facts and ideals before us all the days of our 
lives, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the California 

Misdon 

It is a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be present 
in this great conference of the Latter-day Saints. It is a great privilege 
also to have the opportunity of occupying a few moments in this 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



53 



session of the conference. I have rejoiced very greatly in listening 
to the instructions that have been imparted, and in partaking of the 
spirit of the testimonies that have been borne from the lips of the Lord's 
servants who have been called to address the people. I am happy 
in the work that has been allotted to me to labor as a missionary in the 
California mission, and I am glad to say that my companions in that 
mission, as a rule, are at the present time in the enjoyment of good 
health They manifest an anxious desire to magnify their callings 
and discharge the responsibilities that have been placed upon them by 
virtue of their appointment as missionaries and representatives of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The missonaries are 
very largely young men and young women who have not had very 
much experience in Church responsibility. It is, however, universal 
that when they come to the mission headquarters, they come with a 
full determination to try to play the part that may be allotted to them 
to the very best of their ability. They are ready and willing to go 
wherever they may be appointed ; and it has been a source of constant 
wonder to note the manner in which they come to understand the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of the gospel, and acquire the ability to expound 
them. It has been a source of very great joy to me to be associated 
with the missionaries of the California mission, and I am sure that their 
hearts are touched and pricked by the power of God, and that they 
do believe, with just as great fervency as their fathers and mothers 
believe, in the truth of the restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

We try to encourage men and women to believe that the Lord 
our Godj as has been declared during these services, has manifested 
himself again to the children of men, that he has revealed anew the 
doctrines of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that he has con- 
ferred upon men, by the sending of holy angels from his presence, 
the authority that is necessary not only to expound understandingly, but 
to administer legally and properly the saving ordinances of the gospel. 
We try to impress upon the minds of these young missionaries that 
without that divine authority that was bestowed upon the head of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, at the opening of this dispensation, there can- 
not be any salvation. Salvation is obtained through obedience to 
the doctrines of the gospel, and no man can teach those doctrines and 
administer those ordinances, except he be called of God as the Scriptures 
teach. We [try to impress upon them the truth of the doctrine set 
forth by one of the old prophets when he made the statement that we 
must go to the law and to the testimony, and if we speak not according 
to that word there is no light in us. I believe, and I am satisfied my 
companions believe, and the Latter-day Saints who reside in the mission 
believe, that there has been committed to this people a great and im- 
portant message, and that that message has been committed to them in 
fulfilment of the promises made by the Lord our God long ago. For our 
Father in heaven declared by the mouths of holy prophets, in ages 
long gone by, that in the latter days the Lord God of heaven would 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



set his hand to accomplish a marvelous work and a wonder. He de- 
clared that truth by the mouth of the Prophet Daniel when the king's 
dream was interpreted, and he declared that the dream was certain 
and the interpretation thereof was sure. We believe therefore we are 
to go to the law and to the testimony to discover the will of God and 
the doctrines of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

While we find many people in the mission who profess to be be- 
lievers in the law of God, and who apparently are quite sincere when 
they make such declarations, we discover that when we read from the 
law of the gospel and the doctrines that were taught by the Redeemer 
of the world and his apostles whom he commissioned to teach the in- 
habitants of the earth, that they do not believe, as they claim to 
believe, in the messages found in the holy scriptures. We believe that 
we place in the hands of all men the key to prove the falsity of the 
religion we are representing, if it be not true, from the fact that we say 
that it is the old gospel restored anew ; and the inhabitants of the 
earth have in their hands the record that contains the doctrines of that 
gospel, as they were taught by an inspired ministry in the meridian 
of time. And I am happy to say that it is not the experience of the 
missionaries in the California mission that men come to them with the 
word of God in their hands, and call to their attention doctrines that 
are being taught that are not in harmony with the law of the Lord. 

We believe and teach that there is but one gospel ; and that 
seems at times not to be very palatable to many people with whom 
we come in contact. It seems popular in the feelings of men and women 
today to feel that there are many systems of religion which will carry 
them back into the presence of God, to be approved ; and we do not feel 
that it is our privilege to delude people with any intimation that if they 
will continue in good living, being good citizens and good neighbors, 
all will be well in the life to come! We do feel that responsibility rests 
upon us to bear testimony to the things that the Lord our God hath 
wrought — and that is, the restoration of the authority to speak in 
the name of Jesus Christ. When we speak by that authority we teach 
only the doctrines that have been given by the Redeemer of the world 
by which men are to be saved. We feel in our hearts that, "we are not 
ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salva- 
tion." We are under obligation to our Father in heaven, and to his 
Church here upon the earth, to expound those doctrines and to de- 
clare to the inhabitants of the earth that there is but one gospel, and 
that, though we or an angel from heaven or representatives from any 
religious denomination on the face of the earth, preach not the doctrine 
and the gospel that was taught by the ancient apostles, the curse of 
God will be upon us. We believe, my brethren and sisters, that the 
beginning of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is just as it is de- 
clared by St. Mark, that the forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ taught 
the beginning of that gospel, when he taught men the gospel of re- 
pentance and the gospel of baptism for the remission of sins. We be-

lieve that in this age of the world, just as in that age of the world, 
men reject the counsel of God against themselves, not being willing to 
receive the principle and ordinance, given by the Lord our God, that 
initiates them into the Kingdom of God and that makes them members 
of the Church of Christ. 

You know that, in the gospel according to St. Luke, the declaration 
is made that the people who would not receive the ordinance of bap- 
tism, that was being administered to the people by John the Baptist, 
rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not thus bap- 
tized. We are trying to impress upon the minds of the people that there 
is necessity in this age of the world to hearken to those doctrines, and 
that it is of the greatest importance that they shall put away from 
them the follies in which men have believed and in which they are 
believing today, and that they shall receive the truth which has been 
made manifest by the revelations of the Lord our God. We are trying 
to convince men that the authority of which we speak has always been 
essential and necessary in the accomplishment of the purposes of our 
Father in heaven. Whenever God has had a message for the inhabit- 
ants of the earth he has raised up men who have been clothed with 
power from on high and who have been commissioned by the voice 
and commandment of God (o carry to the children of men the message 
that the Lord has for them. God has always operated through his 
chosen servants, and by them he has made known his will to the peo- 
ples of the earth in all past dispensations. 

We 'are trying to convince men and women of the truth and the 
fulfilment of the promise made by the Almighty through the lips of 
an inspired apostle regarding a great event in the latter time — for so 
he did promise. The angel told John, "Come up hither and I will 
show thee things that shall be hereafter" — not things that were trans- 
piring then, in the meridian of time, but things of importance that 
would transpire in the future history of the world. So says the law of 
God, the law and the testimony. We invite men, whatever their re- 
ligious persuasions may be, or whatever their expectations may be, to 
remember that if they speak not according to the law and to the 
testimony it is because there is no light in them, and the law and the 
testimony given by God through the mouth of an inspired Apostle is that 
in the latter times another angel should "fly in the midst of heaven, 
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the 
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, say- 
ing with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the hour 
of his judgment is come." So says the law. Let who will dispute it, let 
who will denounce it, and oppose it, it is the law and word of God, 
and we are under obligation and responsibility, in this great dispensa- 
tion of the fulness of times, to bear witness that God is true and that 
the promises that have been made by him in ancient times, through 
his inspired ministry, are being fulfilled; and to bear record that the 
very heavens and the earth may pass away but the promise of God in

relation to the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the latter 
times cannot pass away without fulfilment. 

We are joyful in bearing witness, wherever we have opportunity, 
that we have been made acquainted with that message, thus revealed, 
and that the angel, promised by the Lord our God, has come to the 
earth; and upon the head of the Prophet Joseph, by holy beings, the 
authority and power and the commandment and direction of the Lord 
our God were given for the establishment of the great work to which 
we have given our allegiance. We call men's attention to the manner 
in which this work was introduced by an innocent boy falling upon 
his knees and pleading with the Lord for information, that his soul 
might be saved. Who is there that can find fault with the boy ap- 
pealing to God in this manner, and the answer that was given of our 
Father in heaven ? Men do not believe it, but we not only believe, but 
we know, that in answer to that prayer our Father in heaven and our 
Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, made answer, and made the declara- 
tion that the time had come, that was spoken of by the holy prophets, in 
relation to the work of the latter times. That knowledge has come into 
our souls. It has gladdened our hearts. It has filled us with a desire 
and a determination to clear our skirts of the blood of all men, and to 
bear witness that God has sent his hand to accomplish that work, and 
that the work will be accomplished. May the Lord God help us to 
play our part therein, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church 

I am thankful this morning, my brethren and sisters, in having 
this opportunity of meeting with you in conference, in having fellow- 
ship with you and with these my brethren whose lives are devoted to 
the service of the Lord. I rejoice in the opportunity I have of labor- 
ing with you and of trying in my humble way to further the cause of 
the Lord. I sincerely pray that while I shall stand before you this 
morning he will bless and strengthen me that I may speak words of 
counsel and bear testimony to you of his goodness which will be 
acceptable unto him. 

Many good things have been said to us during this conference' 
thus far. I was thinking this morning, and I have been thinking for 
a number of weeks, in the few moments I have had when I could 
think of things other than those things which come to us in the regular 
course of business — I have tried to think of something that would be 
well to say to this congregation. I have gone home weary at 
night, after having had a strenuous day, and upon awaking in the 
morning, I have thought and read and studied, and I have been 
bewildered in the thought of approaching this task. Not that the task 
is burdensome to me, but that, as I serve, the field of service opens 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

up so broad and appears to me so big, I wonder if I will ever be 
equal to it! 

When Brother George Albert Smith was speaking of the govern- 
ment of the United States, my mind turned to the government of the 
Church. How well has God provided for the government of his 
Church, and for the training of his children. My particular duty in 
the Church does not take me especially to the outsiders; that is, to 
those who do not believe as I believe ; but my labor is more particularly 
with the members of the Church, the Lesser Priesthood, which holds 
the keys of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel, which 
gospel is the gospel of repentance, and baptism, by immersion, for the 
remission of sins. One of the first commandments given by God to 
Adam was that he be baptized and that he teach his children to be 
baptized. Adam asked: "Why is it that men should be baptized?" 
and the Lord's answer was that, "all men must repent and be bap- 
tized by immersion for the remission of sins in the name of mine Only 
Begotten, the only name under heaven by which man might be saved." 

This preparatory gospel is the field of service in which I am called 
to labor, and I rejoice in it. As I labor, from day to day, I see in it 
great responsibility. I wonder sometimes if we who hold the Priest- 
hood of the living God fully realize what it means to us to be so blessed. 
I recall that so far as we have record, this Lesser Priesthood was held 
anciently only by mature men. In the beginning of the Church this 
/Priesthood was conferred upon men, but the Lord to my mind has 
clearly shown that it was not intended that it should be held only by 
mature men, but its real purpose, to my mind, is to prepare men for 
service in this Church. Men who enter the Church in their mature 
years should gain their experience through the Lesser Priesthood. Boys 
who are just entering into their ministry should gain their experience 
through this Priesthood, which holds the keys of the ministering of 
angels and the preparatory gospel. You will recall that the keys of 
the ministering of angels are given to prepare for service. It is a 
preparatory work. This is clearly shown in section 20 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, in which the Lord has defined the duties of the 
Priesthood. The Priest's especial duty it is to be with the Church 
' — and I take it where the Lord said, "to be with the Church," he 
meant those who are faithful, those who are diligent, those who are 
humble and striving earnestly to keep the commandments of God. 
The duty of the Priest is to be with them, to preach, teach, expound, 
exhort and baptize, and to see that they pray vocally and in secret. 
The duty of the Teacher is to be with the Church ; not those who are 
indifferent, not those who are antagonistic, but those who have faith 
in God and desire to help their fellowmen in their desire to learn of God 
and his purposes. In this office, the duty is to see that there is no 
iniquity in the Church, no evil speaking, no backbiting or fault-find- 
ing, but to see that the members meet together often and do their, duty. 
The duty of the Deacon is to assist the Teacher and the Priest when- 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ever occasion requires. To me, my brethren and sisters, that means this : 
Although in the beginning this Priesthood was conferred upon mature 
men, to my mind it has been given for the purpose of developing young 
men, or boys, as they grow and begin to gain knowledge, which knowl- 
edge is only of value to them as they can make use of it through 
service. 

So I take it, the Lord intended that in the Church, when fully 
established, young men should have opportunity to serve along with 
the older men. So it has been decided by his servants that young men 
might have this opportunity. The Deacons are ordained in their 
tender years; no fixed time in which they should be ordained. This 
should be measured by their ability to serve, and their desire to serve, 
that they may gain experience in this work, this ministry in which out- 
ward ordinances are the field of labor. They are put to work passing 
the sacrament, running errands, acting as messengers doing a hundred 
and one things they can do, to help impress upon them the import- 
ance of service, and the importance of their position in the Church. 
After a few years of such service, under proper guidance, they step 
into the next field of labor, that of the teacher, where it is their duty 
to see that there is no iniquity, no evil-speaking, backbiting, or fault- 
finding. Can you conceive of any work that might come into the 
life of a boy at the age of fourteen or fifteen years that will bring to 
him greater protection than to have a knowledge of the fact that it is 
his duty to help keep the Church clean spiritually and physically? 

And I take it, it is his duty at this age to visit the homes of the 
members, for his duty is with the Church, those' who sympathize with 
him and know something of his problems, and have a desire to help 
him in his struggle in life. Think what it would mean to him to enter 
the homes of the members of the Church to teach these things, and in 
return receive the blessings of the members of these households. Then, 
after years of service in this work, under the guiding hand of wise 
men, he steps into the office of Priest where he learns to preach, teach, 
expound and exhort, not among those who are unfriendly and who do 
not believe as he believes, but among those who sympathize with him, 
those who realize, to a certain extent, the task that is before him and 
those who, guided by the Spirit of God, reach out a helping hand to lift 
him over that rugged road and help place him firmly upon his feet in 
the service of God. 

This is a work, my brethren and sisters, depending upon no one 
individual, every one who holds the Priesthood and all who hold the 
Priesthood combining together in service to carry on the work of the 
Lord. This is a wonderful opportunity we have, and I am wonder- 
ing if there isn't more we can do unitedly to carry on this great work 
of the Lord, to see to it that the young men in the Church are better 
prepared for the rriinistry when the time shall come for them to be 
called to go into the world to preach to those who are unfriendly and

do not believe as we believe. Let me call your attention to a parable 
given to us by the Savior : 

"And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will 
return from^ the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may 
open unto him immediately. 

"Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh shall find 
watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them 
to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. 

"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, 
and find them so, blessed are those servants. 

"And this know, that if the good man of the house had known what 
hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered 
his house to be broken through. 

"Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour 
when ye think not. 

"Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, 
or even to all? 

"And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom 
his Lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of 
meat in due season? 

"Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find 
so doing. 

"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that 
he hath. 

"But and if that servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming; 
and shall begin to beat the men servants and maidens, and to eat and drink, 
and to be drunken; 

"The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for 
him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and 
will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. 

"And that servant, which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, 
neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. 

"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall 
be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall 
be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will 
ask the more." 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that we may be found faithful 
and diligent to the end, that when the time shall come for us to be 
called by the Master we will be found worthy of an exaltation with 
him. May God so bless us. I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Eastern 
States Mission 

Through President Joseph W. McMurrin you have heard a report 
from the shores of the Pacific. I feel myself particularly happy to be 
able to follow him so nearly by making something of a report of the 
work of the Lord from the Atlantic seaboard, so that you may hear 
this morning, and in this same meeting a report from the shores of 
the sea west and a report from the shores of the sea east of the land of 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Zion. I too can report that the health condition of the missionaries 
in the Eastern states is very fine, and also that the spiritual health of 
our mission is splendid. That thing we used to speak of in the army 
as the corps d 'esprit is most excellent in the Eastern States mission. 
At the present time there are no doubt many more Latter-day Saints 
on the shores of the Pacific than there are on the shores of the 
Atlantic. Perhaps if our missions were to be judged as to its success 
by the number of baptisms, there might be considerable discouragement, 
for acceptance of our great latter-day message is rather slow on that 
tier of states that constitute the Eastern States mission of our Church. 
It is only proper to say, however, that the slow progress of our work 
is not due to any lack of effort or earnestness of purpose on the part 
of the missionaries who represent the work of the Lord in that place ; 
and, in order that you may have data on which you may form your 
judgment as to that, I am going to read as rapidly as I may an account 
of a few of our activities. I did hope that I should be able to have 
in my hands, before I made this report, a compiled report for the last 
nine months, closing with September. That report, however, has not 
reached my hands yet, so I am going to take our report of the month 
of August, from which you can form some judgment as to the activities 
of the representatives of the Church in the Eastern States mission: 

Through the month of August we had 129 missionaries in active service. 
The number of hours spent in tracting, by that number of mission- 



aries, was 18,924 

Hours visiting saints, of course for purposeful labor, 9,547 

Hours spent in attending meetings 4,491 

Hours visiting investigators, teaching them the gospel at their firesides 4,186 

Hours spent in gospel conversations 14,659 

Hours devoted to study by this body of (129) missionaries 8,443 

Number of families visited 35,594 

Number of investigators visited 1,890 

The number of gospel conversations in the month, of this body of 

missionaries 28,087 

Number of Books of Mormon sold, for the month 197 

Other books distributed 527 

Tracts distributed 43,105 

Pamphlets distributed 26,942 

Hall meetings held 394 

Cottage meetings held 205 

Open air meetings held 303 

Making a total of meetings in halls, cottages and open air, for the 

month of August 902 



Perhaps you will be disposed to agree with me that these figures 
represent a great volume of missionary activity. 

Now I am almost loath to read the next item because the numbers 
are so small, but I feel that we are not responsible for the smallness 
of these numbers, so you must have it with the rest. Out of all this 
effort, and perhaps very much effort that preceded the month of 
August, we only had thirty baptisms. You see we have to put forth a 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



61 



ton of effort in order to get an ounce of results ; but, thank God, we 
did put forth the ton of effort. And then, if we count the value of 
souls, as God counts them, perhaps we had great reward for our efforts. 
The Lord in this new dispensation of the gospel has made it known that 
the value of a soul is great unto God. One of the elders in an early 
day of the Church was told that if he should devote his whole life to 
the ministry, and should save only one soul, yet great would be his 
joy with that one soul in heaven. 

During the last six months, nay during just the last month, 
September, we have completed and dedicated two chapels in the Eastern 
States mission; one in Baltimore, Maryland, and one in Fairmont, 
West Virginia. These two, with the chapel that was dedicated last 
January in Charleston, West Virginia, makes three chapels within 
the past two years that we have built and dedicated to the Lord in that 
land, at an aggregate cost of about $54,000. One third of the amount 
in the case of the West Virginia chapels has been raised by the sub- 
scriptions of the Saints and their friends in that land. I have been 
tempted to believe, that perhaps the establishment of chapels in the 
Eastern States mission marks progress in the development of the work 
of the Lord on the Atlantic seaboard of the land of Zion. It rather 
indicates that we are approaching that time when we shall establish 
permanent stations in that part of the land, when we shall carry to 
the people the institutions of Zion, not only the regular Church organiza- 
tion as expressed in branches, but our Sabbath schools, Mutual Im- 
provement associations, Primary associations, Relief Societies and all 
those helps in government which can, as I believe, be made mighty 
agencies for reaching the lives of the people in those communities; 
using not only the testimony of the missionaries, but likewise the testi- 
mony of the institutions of Zion in bringing men to a knowledge of 
the latter-day word of God. 

I believe that this note of permanency given to our work in the 
Eastern States mission means a return to the vision and purpose that 
were in the mind of the Prophet Joseph in the last conference that he 
held in Nauvoo, April 1844. At that time many of the Saints felt 
that the ideas about the establishment of Zion in Jackson county had 
been somewhat disrupted, and certainly postponed. The Prophet, to 
reestablish confidence in the minds of his people concerning Zion, and 
in the promises which God had made concerning Israel, enlarged 
their vision about Zion by calling their attention to the fact that it was 
not circumscribed by the lines of Jackson county, nor by the 
lines of the State of Missouri, but under a very burst of 
inspiration from God, he made known that the whole land 
of America, North and South, was the land of Zion ; and that God's 
purposes concerning Zion (sometimes also called the land of Joseph), 
contemplated larger things than the brethren had so far dreamed of. 
He announced at that conference that the whole land of America — this 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"land choice above all other lands," was Zion ; wherever the elders went, 
and could find those who would receive the testimony which they bore, 
they were at liberty to establish "stakes of Zion" through their ministry 
in all parts of the land ; and he specifically named the city of Boston 
as a suitable place for a stake of Zion, and New York as a suitable 
place for a stake of Zion, also I think Philadelphia. President Brig- 
ham Young, following him at the conference, in his remarks declared 
that the prophet's announcement was a "sweepstakes" in giving this 
larger vision of what would constitute Zion. Well, of course, the 
martyrdom of the Prophet, the expatriation of the Latter-day Saints 
from the United States, and their journey to these mountains, post- 
poned, for a time, the things contemplated at that time by the Prophet 
Joseph. Perhaps, as a community, we were to learn what we some- 
times find out as individuals, namely, that the farthest way around is 
often the nearest way home. It was necessary that these decades, between 
themartyrdom of the Prophet and now, should pass. The history that we 
have written in our exodus to these western lands, the establishment of 
stakes of Zion here — and the growth of the Latter-day Saints into a 
great and united community, where they could accumulate means, and 
experience, that would enable them to take possession of their larger 
inheritance throughout the land of Zion, were necessary. But now, 
strengthened as we are, experienced as we have come to be, may we not 
lift our vision to comprehend the larger purpose of God in the gathering 
of Israel out of the world to the whole land of Zion, and the redemption 
of it through stakes of Zion bein^ established east as well as west? For 
I do want to claim for the Eastern States that they constitute just as 
acceptable regions in which stakes of Zion can be established as are to be 
found on the Pacific shores of the land of Zion. And when we sing, 
"America," that great American anthem — "My country 'tis of thee, 
sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing" — we want to have a larger vision 
than the State of Utah affords; or that any other state affords. We 
want to include in our thoughts every part of the land that is under 
the protecting aegis of the Constitution of the United States, which 
God established, by raising up inspired men to lay the true founda- 
tions of civil liberty in the world. So, too, when we speak of Zion and 
God's purposes with reference to the gathering of Israel, and the 
establishment of Zion, we want to have a larger vision than these valleys 
of the Rocky Mountains afford, splendid and glorious as they are to 
us, and dear to our affections, for they are not the whole of Zion, nor 
even the center of Zion ; and to those who understand aright, never were 
thought upon as more than a resting place for Israel while preparing 
for greater possessions, including these. We want to remember, Latter- 
day Saints, that Zion, her center place, the center city of Zion, where 
God's house, The Temple of temples is to be erected, has not been 
moved out of her place. It is still where God declared it to be, near 
Independence, Jackson county, Missouri, in the center of the land. 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



63 



The center as to these United States of America, midway be- 
tween "the sea east and the sea west;" midway between our 
boundary line on the north and our boundary line on the south ; 
and, strangely enough, when contemplated with reference to the old 
North American Continent — the land of Eden, as well as the land of 
Zion — contemplated with reference to the whole continent ; midway, the 
Panama region and the far North beyond the Hudson Bay ; and as 
already I have told you, about equal distance between the west sea 
and the east sea. Well, Zion has not been moved out of her place, and 
God's decree must be fulfilled in relation to the establishment of Zion 
itself, as well as the stakes of Zion. We want to keep that within the 
range of our vision. 

I am happy to say to you that in the East, no less than in the West, 
we are making proclamation of this same gospel to which President 
Joseph McMurrin bore such splendid testimony. We had made the 
keynote of our ministry in the Eastern States : "The Lord hath 
spoken!" We open with Isaiah's text: "Hear, O heavens, and give 
ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken !" And from that starting point 
we, too, develop the message of the new dispensation of the gospel. 
Not a new gospel. We have no new God to present to the world ; no 
new Redeemer to offer; no new plan devised for man's salvation, but 
"the everlasting gospel." That gospel which was formulated and 
agreed upon by the children of God, even before the foundations of the 
earth itself were laid ; being that covenant of eternal life which 
God, who cannot lie, promised (Titus 1 :2-3) before the foundation of 
the earth itself were laid. We are preaching this new dispensation of 
the old gospel ; and your sons and your daughters in the east-lands, 
O Latter-day Saints, are faithful and true to the dispensation of that 
gospel committed unto them. God grant that they may continue true, 
and that we may be able to impress upon the hearts of the children 
of men that God has again spoken from heaven, and is reestablishing 
his Church in the earth, I pray, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 

President Soren M. Nielsen, of the North Sanpete stake of Zion, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock p. m., October 4, 1924, President Heber J. Grant, 
who presided, announced that the congregation would sing, "We thank 
thee, O God, for a prophet."

After the singing, Elder Wayne H. Redd, President of the San 
Juan stake of Zion, offered the opening prayer. 

Pearl Robbins sang a solo entitled, "The Song of Ruth." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

IN A GREAT PESENCE 

I stand in a great presence. Surrounded by the First Presidency 
and the General Authorities of the Church, confronted by those who 
are appointed and set apart as administrators of the Lord's work in 
the stakes and wards and missions of the Church, and in the midst of 
other Saints of the Lord, it is not surprising that one should feel the 
weight of the responsibility of attempting to deliver a message which 
shall be compatible with the Spirit of our Father and acceptable to 
these men and women. I am always awed in this great building at one 
of our general conferences. There devolves upon one such a tre- 
mendous sense of responsibility as to make one crave more than under 
almost any other circumstances, the guidance and the promptings of 
the Holy Spirit, and I sincerely trust that that which I may say may 
ring true to my brethren, and with the remarks and the testimonies 
which have been heretofore given. 

A COMPARISON 

Some few years ago, through the courtesy of Brother Snroot, 1 
had the privilege of attending the second plenary session of the great 
Disarmament Conference which was held in the city of Washington, 
where representatives of great nations of the earth met to consider 
plans for the limitation of the armaments and military operations. I 
remember distinctly that upon that occasion I was deeply impressed 
with the importance of the great subject to be discussed, and with the 
dignity of the men who came to represent the various countries. I 
saw such men as Balfour of England, the great ex-premier, Ex-premier 
Briand of France, and the notable Kato of Japan, and other dignitaries, 
standing in that assembly representing and speaking for their peoples ; 
and I was rather overwhelmed with the transcendent importance of 
these men and the occasion. But I have since thought that as we gather 
together here in the semi-annual conferences of the Church, such con- 
ferences as that which I attended, and which so impressed me, had 
no more and greater significance and deep meaning to the people of 
the world than do these assemblies. Those men met to represent the 
nations. We meet to represent God and his work in the earth. We 
come together to hear the voice of his prophet and to feel the flow 
of his Spirit course through our beings, to stimulate us to higher 
endeavor in his mighty service, and to give us vision of the great 
work he designed we shall accomplish as his representatives here on 
the earth.

HERE ONLY MAY BE HEARD THE WORD OF GOD 

I am aware that it always seems a highly presumptuous thing to 
make the statement that here only may be heard the word of God 
through his living oracles. In a sense it is embarrassing to make that 
statement, either to ourselves or to the world. We are, however, con- 
strained to make it, because God himself hath said it, and we do but 
our duty in proclaiming to the children of men that here with this 
comparably small people is to be found the word of God, delivered 
to the people of the world, under the only authority existent upon 
the earth at this time. 

A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY 

When I contemplate the tremendous responsibility that devolves 
upon us as a people in the assertion and the statement that we so make, 
I tremble lest we may not measure up in highest degree to the fulness 
of the Lord's expectations of us. I say, I stand in a great presence, 
in the presence of my brethren of the Priesthood. May I not safely 
conclude, as well, in the presence of my living God ? Is it unreasonable 
to think that after having caused his Church to be established and 
set up in the world as he has done, that he is "listening in" at these 
conferences, and that "listening in," he likewise gives inspiration and 
direction to those who undertake in his name to represent him and to 
speak his word to the assembled Saints? 

REVERENCE FOR GOD ESSENTIAL TO THE PEACE OF MANKIND 

I have long been persuaded that a definite, conscious, genuine 
reverence for God is essential to the peace and joy of mankind, and 
I know likewise that no wholesome reverence for the Lord will ever 
come except there be an understanding and comprehension of him. 
It follows, too, that there may never be a full understanding of him, 
his personality, his powers, his attributes, unless men live his com- 
mandments and do his will. To some, that seems to be a very para- 
doxical situation, not to be able to understand the Lord without keep- 
ing his commandments, and not to be able to keep his commandments 
unless we understand him. But it is the true condition under which 
we must come to a realization and testimony of his truth, his supremacy, 
his Fatherhood and his great and wonderful power. I do not believe 
that in this great country of ours which has been so lauded during this 
conference, there will ever be a satisfactory upholding of the Con- 
stitution, a decent conformity to laws and statutes and ordinances un- 
less there be at the basis of all patriotism and loyalty to country, a deep- 
seated conscious reverence for the God of the land. It may seem to 
some of my fellow citizens an almost fanatic view to take that 
religion is so inseparably associated with the inception of this 
great government and its existence as to form an integral part of the 
loyalty and devotion of true citizens of the State ; but I assert it never- 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



theless. I believe America to be a Christian country. I believe the 
principles which are set forth in her fundamental laws to be derived 
from, consciously, the Savior of the world. His precepts, his prin- 
ciples of truth and living, have been set forth by the founders and 
the fathers in our laws and statutes; and America, in order to con- 
tinuously and satisfactorily fill her great mission as a mighty nation, 
must conform to those fundamental laws and principles of truth, in 
my humble judgment. Reverence for the Lord does not bring forth 
the class of men and women who ,today assail the fundamental laws 
of this land. They who are designated as the Reds, the Anarchists, 
those who are inimical to our established institutions, I venture, could 
they all be found out and analyzed, would not be men who love God 
and who revere his name and who acknowledge his power and his 
supremacy in the earth. The loyal citizens in this country, in my 
humble opinion, are to be found .among the God-fearing, God-loving 
people jvho still trust him and honor him, who recognize his great 
providence in the inception and growth of this mighty country; and 
when reverence for God fades and gives way, loyalty, patriotism, de- 
votion to country, will likewise vanish. 

OUR COUNTRY AND OUR CHURCH COMMAND OUR ALLEGIANCE 

And this is the thought that primarily I would like to give today : 
that our Country and our Church so command our allegiance and our 
whole-souled devotion that we have no time, no excess energy to 
devote to other and extraneous purposes which in any sense might be 
concluded to be, in the least degree, inimical to the interest of either 
Church or Country. Every Latter-day Saint finds within the Church 
so many opportunities for the expression of his service, his good will, 
and his love for his fellows that he need not go beyond the organ- 
izations and agencies of the Church to find places where he can 
expend his time and his energy and his money for the uplift of 
mankind. 

I do not mean to imply that certain co-operative efforts on the 
part of people engaged in similar lines of endeavor are not desirable. 
I believe in co-operation, for the stimulation of our markets and other 
economic advantages. I believe in the protection of our trade and in 
the safeguarding of our institutions by proper kinds of co-operation ; 
but I maintain that a man who divides his allegiance and his energy 
and his endeavor along many lines will usually fail to accomplish any- 
thing very significant in any one of them. I believe that the old 
message which has come to us for years and years past, to confine 
our endeavor to the spreading of the gospel, to the teaching of its 
principles, to the people, to the building up of our country, to the 
sustaining of those great institutions which have been inspired to safe- 
guard liberty, equity, and justice in the earth, comprehends about all 
that any man may give to people, country or church. 

I regard it as unfortunate that there should arise in the midst of 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



67 



the people of the country institution after institution claiming the 
allegiance and devotion and energy of the citizens of our country, and 
in some measure at least winning them away from the one true ob- 
jective which, in our case, is the establishment of the Lord's work and 
the maintenance of principles of righteousness and justice in the world. 
Any man who bears the Priesthood of God has the power to serve 
mankind. Indeed, others who do not bear it have a power to serve 
mankind, but not in the same effective way. They cannot perform the 
ordinances, the great and helpful things so indispensable to the hap- 
piness and joy of men. But they who are endowed with this .holy 
.Priesthood, who are so favored of God as to share a portion of the 
power by which he himself rules the world and ministers to man are 
entitled to go forth in his name and do his work, and that work com- 
mands their whole thought, time, and energy, their devotion, their 
love and their loyalty. I am conscious of the fact when I say this, 
that, engaged as we are in promoting the great work of the Lord, we 
have numerous secular — if I may use that word — duties to perform. 
We are engaged in financial endeavor and enterprise. We seek to 
build up the country in one way. and another; but every true Latter- 
day Saint does all this with an eye single to the glory of God, con- 
secrating, dedicating and devoting all his time, talent and energy to 
the great purpose of building up the Lord's kingdom. He does that 
even in the accumulation of his own private means and property, be- 
cause in his heart there is a disposition to devote that property and, 
if need be, all that comes into his possession, to the establishment of 
our Father's work. 

AN APPEAL FOR UNDIVIDED SUPPORT 

My brethren and my sisters, too, I appeal for your undivided 
support for the great work which finds itself in prosperous condi- 
tion as reported by the President of the Church, and by the brethren 
who have spoken. We have reason to feel encouraged, but our safety 
and the eternal progress of the work depends upon our continued 
vigilance, upon our steadfast devotion and upon giving to this work 
the utmost of talent and thought and study and prayerful considera- 
tion. I know that the work will receive that kind of consideration. I 
have faith and confidence in my brethren. Personally, I am grateful 
for their association. When I contemplate the fact that my lot is cast 
with the men in whose midst I now stand, I raise my voice to God in 
thanksgiving and in gratitude for that blessed privilege. As I move 
about among the Presidents of Stakes, and the Bishops of Wards I 
ever say to myself: where else could I be thrown into such good 
company? where I could meet such good, honest, upright, noble men 
whose contact with my life lifts me up and builds me every time I meet 
them and go among them? God bless the men who preside in and 
direct the destinies of the people of the stakes and the wards, and the 
missions; and God let his choice blessings rest upon the man who, 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



under God, directs the destinies of the Church. I pray for him, I 
uphold him, and I sustain him, and I know that God gives his word 
through him. I testify to this, and I appeal, my brethren and sisters, 
for your undivided support, your devotion, your whole-souled loyalty 
to the great institutions of the Church and of our beloved Country, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

President of the First Council of Seventy 

My Brehren and Sisters : I heartily endorse the remarks that have 
been made at this conference. The speakers have given to the con- 
gregation ideas of helpfulness and encouragement, and with all my 
heart, I echo the sentiments of the last speaker in regard to the Pres- 
ident of the Church and those associated with him. 

Today we see evidence of the truth of that prophetic utterance 
made by the prophet Joseph Smith on the 12th day of August, 1842, on 
the banks of the Mississippi river, in the little town of Montrose, — that 
the Saints would finally be driven from city to city, from state to state, 
and finally from the United States into the midst of the Rocky Moun- 
tains where they would become a great people. I am sure today that 
this prophecy is being fulfilled; that is, the clause referring to the 
greatness of the people. There is no evidence of lack of loyalty to the 
cause of truth by many thousands and tens of thousands of Latter- 
day Saints. The testimonies received when the door of baptism was 
entered seems to have been lasting, and to have increased in power 
from the time of the faithful seekers after truth joining the Church 
until the present day. 

The prophet himself desired to know of his relationship with 
the heavenly Father. He went to the Lord, as the scripture designated 
to him, and prayed for light and knowledge and for wisdom ; and in 
response to his prayer, the Father and the Son appeared to him and 
gave to him knowledge of their personality ; and his vision and the 
testimony of it has never been successfully contradicted, although for 
fourteen years after the call came to him as a prophet of God, he 
saw nothing but tribulations and trials. There were in conflict with 
him many leading religious men, men of influence, seemingly, with 
the world at large. He had all this to face. Finally, as the end drew 
near, his faith did not fail him, but when he bade farewell to his family 
and to his friends as he met them on that memorable 23rd day of June, 
on his way to Carthage, he exclaimed, and it was an exclamation that 
came from a full heart : "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, yet 
I have a conscience void of offense towards God and man." We are 
the recipients of blessings through the evidence and call given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. We are in receipt today of all the great 
prospects that he predicted, and realizing that in the near future 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 



69 



there are many more blessings for the Latter-day Saints, that we still 
have a controversy with the world, and that we must maintain our posi- 
tion as a religious body, led by the inspiration of the Lord through his 
prophets. All these considerations should not be taken from our minds 
and memories, but we should be in deep consideration how each indi- 
vidual can lift himself out of any slough of unbelief, of carelessness or 
neglect of duty, and how, at the same time, we can uplift our fellow 
men. The gospel has to be preached to the ends of the earth, to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people, that all may hear the glorious 
sound that shall bring to them redemption from sin, redemption from 
darkness, redemption from ignorance, and place in their hearts and in 
their minds a knowledge of God, a knowledge of his gospel, and a realiz- 
ing sense of the weight of truth that shall bring them not only salva- 
tion here in time, but salvation and exaltation in all eternity. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice today to stand before you and 
bear my testimony. Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God ; and 
since his day there have stood in his place prophets led and inspired 
by the spirit and power that characterized his leadership in the four- 
teen short years of his ministry as a prophet of God. I say fourteen 
short years, because he accomplished so much during that little time 
that it would have needed in some persons more than double the time 
to accomplish what he accomplished, excepting they were like him, in- 
spired by the Spirit and power of God. After his call came, he devoted 
his life, his time, and his energy to the organization of the Priesthood 
and the quorums of the Priesthood, and when he saw a time approach 
that there was a necessity for organizing again other quorums, after the 
Church was organized some five years, the quorum of the Twelve Apos- 
tles and the quorum of the Seventies were chosen and ordained under the 
supervision and under the hands of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I look 
over the quorums of the priesthood and study them somewhat, and I 
am satisfied that he performed a perfect work in his ministry in 
organizing these quorums, and others of the priesthood, as has been 
remarked here today. The Saints are governed and directed and held 
together by these organized quorums, and by the power of God which 
attends their administration. 

I testify to you today of the clean life and elegant conduct of my 
brethren who preside over the Church. I have known them all since 
they were boys, and I testify that no better men can ever live upon the 
face of the earth, no better Church organization has ever existed in 
the Church, than exists today. 

May the Lord continue to bless his people and give them a desire 
to be more perfect and more willing and constant in their service to 
him and to the world at large, and I pray that the blessing of life and 
the blessing of health and peace may be upon all, and upon your loved 
ones at home, those who have come from distances ; and when the 
conference is closed, I pray the Lord to see you safely home without 
accident or hurt, and the blessing of peace to rest upon us all, and the

Spirit of God to move upon us in directing our labors. I ask and pray 
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

In the words of an old prophet: "I will say of Jehovah, he is 
my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust." I have that 
feeling, that conviction burning within me. I have faith in God the 
eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ. I have been taught these 
things all my life, from my earliest childhood ; and for forty years 
nearly, including my foreign service, I have been teaching that God 
is our Father, that we are the offspring of the living God; and I 
believe it. 

I met a Gentile friend — I suppose he is my friend, he has always 
been friendly — a business man, the other day. He said very pleasantly 
to me: "Kimball, I do not believe you have got any religion. I do 
not think you believe what you preach." And I laughed. I learned 
afterwards that he was a "Catholic, and I guess he judged me by 
himself, because I do not think he is a good Catholic, so he hasn't got 
any the best of me. How could he tell from the outside of a man 
whether he has religion, or, call it faith in God and in the gospel of 
Jesus Christ? That can only be discovered by the life we lead and 
by the spirit that is within us. 

If there is anything in the world that I appreciate, it is the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have no desire to 
live with any other people. I occasionally go away with the consent 
of the brethren, but I am always anxious to come back. In March 
of this year I was in San Francisco, and I became lonesome and 
homesick. I think it was on the 6th of March that I preached to the 
people of the Latter-day Saint branch in San Francisco. When I 
finished, the presiding officer said : "Brother Kimball, if you preach 
another sermon like that about Utah, all the people will leave." That 
makes clear how much I think of Utah and her people. "I am not 
given to flattery, when I do not mean it, and I do not simulate an 
affection that I do not honestly feel." 

As far as the brethren of the authorities are concerned, there has 
been no president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
that I have known so thoroughly and well as President Heber J. 
Grant. I have traveled with him through the Southern States, all 
through the south to Mexico. It took us two months before we 
returned. I have slept with him. We were on very friendly terms 
in those days. There were not so many stakes, and we became very 
well acquainted. I have known President Grant and heard about 
him from his earliest childhood, for my mother was a very dear 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 



71 



friend of his mother's, and I have been in their home when I was a 
child. My own father, Heber C. Kimball, took him as a child, and 
stood him on a table and said : "He will be an apostle," and it came 
true. Yes, I sustain President Grant with all my heart, for I realize, 
in part at least, what a great responsibility rests upon him. 

I met a horny-handed son of toil the other day near the Church 
Office Building. He was a Scotchman, and said : "Brother Kimball, 
will you shake hands with me?" I said: "Yes, and be tickled to 
do it." 

"Would you like to hear how I came to join the Church?" 

"Yes, I would like to hear it, for I was born in the Church. I 
never knew anything else." 

Then he told me his story. Little did that man know how he 
stimulated my faith just through that little friendship and testimony. 
As we stood there one of the brethren passed, in fact it was President 
Grant. My back was to him and I did not see him until after he 
got by. This Scotchman said : "Brother Kimball, as unbelievable as 
it is, I pray for that man twice every day of my life, and he did not 
speak to me." 

"Well," I said, "he did not see you. President Grant cannot 
stop to shake hands with every man in all Israel and do anything else. 
You keep on praying, for he has a great responsibility resting upon 
him, for when he speaks in the name of God it is not his own word; 
it is the word of God. God is his dictator, and he must be guided 
and influenced and blessed with the Holy Spirit in order to direct 
this great people." We ought to pray for the brethren ot the 
authorities, as we sustain them as prophets, seers and revelators. 

Brethren and sisters, I have a conviction burning within me, some- 
times, like a living fire. There are a lot of things I do not know, 
but I know some things. I have paid the price. I have eaten the 
bread of adversity. I have drunk the water of affliction, and I have 
found God. I have told you that before. I have found God, and he has 
answered my prayers. I have heard that still small Voice — we call 
it a Voice — spoken to me not infrequently, and whenever I have fol- 
lowed it I was right. So that I can say with you that I am blessed in 
all my ways, because the Father gives to me of his Holy Spirit to 
guide and direct me in every situation, if I am humble and contrite 
in spirit and in truth. 

Brethren, when I think of this gathering, we do not call this a 
Round-Up. I attended a Round-Up on the Fair Grounds and almost 
lost my life when that grand-stand with three or four thousand people 
on it burned down, in ten minutes. My brother Elias and I happened 
to be on the topmost seat, because it was the cheapest. We were about 
the last to get out. I said : "Elias, the Lord is with us again. Praised be 
the name of the Lord." I tried not to be frightened, but you ought to 
have seen inside of me before I got off that stand. The Lord is 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with us in this gathering of the Saints. If you will stop to think for 
a moment of this building, it is faith-promoting. I helped to haul 
sand here, with other Kimball boys, every Saturday, to lay up these 
rock pillars. I was but a boy. I followed my father around the 
temple many times when I was a young boy. These buildings and 
grounds are faith-promoting, and it is wonderful to me the things that 
have been accomplished by this people, as recounted by President Grant. 
I enter the temple twice a week, and as I walk around it I have often 
wondered if President Young and Heber C. Kimball, and others of 
the pioneers, can picture what has been accomplished. I have been in 
Central Park, New York, years and years ago. I saw in this park 
million dollar bridges. I have been in Golden Gate Park time and time 
again, in San Francisco. I was in Denver a short time ago. They have 
twenty-four parks in that one city. But I want to tell you that to 
me, there is not a place on God's green earth like this place right here. 
I thank God that the brethren take good care of it. No cleaner, 
sweeter place is to be found anywhere in the world than right here. 
It is part of the vision that Brigham Young saw. Think of the 
temple! When Brigham Young struck his cane in the ground and 
said : "Right here we will build a temple to our God ;" it was in the 
time of their poverty when they were so poor that father came along 
when the men working on the temple were soaking their bread in 
the stream- of water. Father said : "To you it will be the sweetest 
bread in all your life." It took forty years to build that temple. I will 
never forget when it was dedicated. I was in the Southern States 
where they were driving us like wild animals, and we took our lives 
in our hands. I heard that prophet say when the temple was dedicated, 
as I was here on a visit : "From this time forth the hearts of the children 
of men will be softened towards us." I stand before you as a witness 
of the softening of the hearts of the people in the south. See what 
has been accomplished. At one time Elder Elias Kimball had 
five hundred and fifty elders in the south, and during his presidency 
he handled seventeen hundred and fifty elders, and only two died out 
of that great number of elders, exposed as they were. You cannot 
tell me that God does not answer their prayers. You cannot tell me 
that he does not protect us when we trust in him. I tell you, brethren, 
there never has been a time — I can say this as truthfully as I have 
ever spoken in my life — when I have had a doubt in my heart that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet. That thought has never crept into me. 
I believe in the Prophet Joseph Smith. To me he is a prophet. His 
prophecies have been fulfilled. Pie was a great architect, and God 
directed him, and Brigham Young came here as a great builder, and 
through the efforts and unity of the people, the great mission of this 
Church has been partly fulfilled. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I pray the Lord to bless you and be 
with you. You are a blessed people to rally around and come together 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 73 



as you do to these great conferences, and your stake conferences; be- 
cause I know, even if you forget all that is said, it stimulates faith, 
and God knows we need it. I pray the Lord to bless the authorities 
and everything pertaining to Zion. For the past year I have been 
working like a Trojan to love my enemies. I am making slow progress, 
but if I can live a little longer I will make it yet. The Lord bless you, 
which I pray for in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be able to attend this 
conference and to partake of the Spirit of the Lord that has been 
manifested in each session. I earnestly pray that the Lord may direct 
me to say that which is best at this time. 

There is no doubt in my mind concerning the divine mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restoration of the gospel. I know 
that its principles harmonize with holy writ. The great migration to 
the West, led by Brigham Young under the direction of the Lord, and 
the establishment of the people of the Lord, in this part of the earth, 
is pointed to as a great achievement by hundreds of thousands of peo- 
ple who visit our country ; many often remark to me that they have 
never seen anything like it. It is truly a great achievement ; it is some- 
thing that could not be done by man alone ; the Lord was at the helm, 
as he is today. But the great thing that appeals to me is the principles 
involved in this great latter-day work. While sitting in my seat during 
this conference I have been led to think of the many times that I have 
heard the principles of the gospel discussed from this stand, and of the 
many sermons I have read concerning the doctrines taught from the 
days of Joseph Smith by elders of Israel everywhere. Not only have 
they been preached, but they have been printed and circulated in all 
parts of the earth. Surely people who desire to know the truth must 
pay some attention to a clear exposition of principles of truth. 

Before the time of the revelations to the Prophet Joseph, there 
was not taught, so far as I know, anything concerning the ante-mortal 
state of man. In fact it was repudiated and is today. Very few people 
believe it, yet it is in harmony with holy writ. It was one of the 
principles of the gospel, in the days o-f Adam. It was one of the prin- 
ciples of the gospel, in the days of Noah, and in the days of Abra- 
ham, and in the days of Christ. It has never been changed, it cannot 
be changed. How can men then successfully assail the Church which 
preaches scripture as it is taught in holy writ dating back even to Adam 
our Father. What are men going to do with the scripture that the 
Lord spoke to Jeremiah when he said : 

"Before I formed thee I knew thee ; and before thou earnest forth 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations." 

How can men say there is no truth in the gospel as we teach it, 
if prophets of old have taught it? How are they going to answer the 
gospel that was taught by the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ? What 
is the answer to the principle taught by Paul, to the Corinthians, when 
he asked those Jews who were in a controversy concerning the resur- 
rection of the dead — the Sadducees and the Pharisees who had become 
converted to the doctrines of Christ, but who evidently were discussing 
the resurrection, and even doubting it : "Else what shall they do 
which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are 
they then baptized for the dead?" 

This doctrine also, and all the principles which the Lord revealed 
to Joseph, have stood the test for nearly a century of time, and there 
has never yet been a set of men, with all the learning that the institu- 
tions of the world have been able to give them, who have successfully 
assailed the principles of truth as they have been taught. Can you 
find anything like it in all the history of the world? Investigate the 
organizations of men called churches and learn if they have closely 
followed the scriptures. They are changing their doctrines constantly, 
because they have no real fountain head to deliver unto them the truth. 
But the monument of truth that this Church has erected as an instru- 
ment in the hands of God must certainly stand for or against the 
human family, or that part of them who come in contact with it. 

If I were going to investigate any organization, business or other- 
wise, I most certainly would look at the foundation principles, the by- 
laws of the institution ; I would investigate the strength of the institu- 
tion. And the great majority of men look at material things in that 
way, but they appear to be blinded, so far as the investigation of the 
gospel is concerned. It is easy enough, evidently, to go to church and 
listen to the teachings of men, and take it for granted that they are 
true. They have not thought of having an individual testimony. They 
take it for granted that they are saved ; they have not learned the 
principles which are involved in the great thing called life through 
which salvation is obtained. 

But when men and women come in contact with the history of 
this great Church, not only its organization and its establishment, but 
the eternal part of the Church, they must give unto the Lord their 
allegiance sooner or later, for after all a Church that has shown a steady 
growth every year, a Church which has taught the same principles 
and believed them from the very beginning, must surely draw the 
sober-minded men and women of the earth, the honest in heart, toward 
it. That is the great mission of the Church in the earth, as the Lord 
established it through his servants in these the last days. There can 
be no question as to the validity of the doctrines of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

Why is not the doctrine of baptism for the dead being taught in 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



75 



the great churches of the day? Why is it that men and women do 
not know anything about the pre-existent state of spirits? Because 
they are not guided by divine leadership, they are not able truly to 
interpret the principles of the gospel. Happy is the man or woman 
who becomes acquainted with the principles of the Gospel here in 
mortality and is able to assume the position of a child of God, enjoy- 
ing free agency, with a knowledge that this is God's work, and that 
we can only return to him in the way in which he has ordained. 

I am not at all fearful as to the success of God's work in the earth. 
If there is any man or set of men or individuals who question it, they 
need only to investigate without prejudice the gospel of Jesus Christ 
as recorded in the holy scripture. And the very thing which brings 
them into communication with these principles will lead the honest in 
heart into the Church of Jesus Christ. . There can be no other way. 

I am not fearful at all of the success of this Church ; it will go 
on until it has finished its mission, until the honest in heart in all 
the world shall have heard the gospel of our Redeemer. I do not know 
how many will accept it in this life, I do not know how many will 
accept it in the spirit world, but I do earnestly believe that those who 
stood for the great Jehovah, and who worked faithfully with him in 
that great conflict with Lucifer, those who held his power and who 
labored under his presidency and direction, who were faithful unto 
the trust, and who were counted as of the chosen blood as they 
are counted here, will, in time, be gathered out, and those who did not 
and do not shall not have the privilege of knowing the Lord ; it is 
very doubtful if they will ever have the privilege of returning unto 
him unless it may be through repentance as the gospel has provided. 

I am not ashamed, as Paul has said, of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
It is the power of God' unto salvation. It is the power by which 
miracles are wrought. It is the power by which God can and does 
communicate to man. It is the power by which men may know the 
Lord and hear him and feel his presence, just as surely, and with as 
much certainty as they did in the day of their primeval childhood, when 
they walked by sight and not by faith. The work of God will prevail, 
truth will prevail. There is no reason why any man with sober mind 
should doubt the principles of the gospel taught by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There can be no failure to it, I care 
not what the world may think, or what men may think. Individuals 
may fail, but the Church of Jesus Christ is founded upon facts, it is 
founded upon revelation, and upon true principles that have been in 
the earth since the earth was peopled, under the direction of Adam, 
our Father in the flesh. And in this dispensation it is the word of 
God, and the Church is the organization of God. It will stand when 
others fail. It will be in the earth to meet the Redeemer when he comes 
to claim his people. I know that his Priesthood is in the earth, and 
that holy men are in this Church presiding over it. I know the Church 
has a prophet in this day, just as surely as it ever had in any dispensa-

tion of the gospel, and it will not, nor can it go. astray. At times it 
may be hindered in its growth, but it will eventually triumph, and the 
principles involved in it will become the common knowledge of the 
honest in heart in all the world. 

I pray the Lord to bless us. Israel will prosper, and the Church, 
through its ministry, will grow. The results of our work as elders 
in the earth are being felt daily. Thousands and thousands of people 
are being led into the waters of baptism. They are found in every 
part of the country, and the country is filled with honorable people 
who, in their hearts, desire to know the truth. It is hard to be weeded 
out from the convictions that have surrounded them, planted there by 
father and mother and a long line of progenitors, but when they hear 
the truth and study it, they accept it. I believe that the Lord provides 
for the restoration of his family according to their faith and as they 
prepare themselves and are qualified as a result of their faith to come 
into this Church, they come into it and become members of it, and 
begin to work for it. That is the history of it, and it shall not change 
till the end shall come. 

I pray the Lord to bless us, in the name of Christ. Amen. 

ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 

Assistant Church Historian 

I hope, my brethren and sisters, that I may have the Spirit of 
the Lord to be with me in the few remarks that I may make this after- 
noon. This is the first time that I have been called upon to speak 
at a general conference, and I certainly feel the need of the aid of 
your faith and prayers, my brethren and sisters, and of the Spirit of 
the Lord. 

I rejoice that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I am proud of my parentage — of my father and 
of my mother. I am proud of the teachings that they gave to me in 
my youth, and I only hope and pray that I may always be faithful 
to the teachings of my beloved parents. I have a testimony that the 
gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that this is the work of God, that the 
men who stand at the head of this Church are men of God, that they 
have the Priesthood, that they are called and chosen in this day to 
lead God's Church, and I pray that the Lord will bless them always 
with health and with strength, that they may carry on this great work, 
the leadership of which has been given to them in this dispensation. 

As a young man I have often wondered if the youth of Zion 
really and truthfully appreciate the wonderful privilege they have 
of working in the Church of God, if they really have faith in the 
doctrines and principles that are set forth by this wonderful Church 
of ours. I consider it a great privilege to work in the Church of God, 
and I desire always to work in it. 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND

I have often wondered if we have the faith in the truth that is 
necessary for us to have, in order to stand when trials and tribulations 
come upon us. I wonder if I could stand if the same trials and 
tribulations should come upon me that have come upon those who have 
passed to the great beyond. When trials and persecutions were 
heaped upon the prophet and upon the leaders of this Church, it took 
faith, my brethren and sisters, to stand in those perilous times. In the 
times of Kirtland, in those dark days when apostles, some of them, 
were leaving the Church, apostatizing, because the evil one had gained 
power over them. Then such men as John Taylor, wonderfully brave 
and courageous, stood forth and testified to the people that it was 
through Joseph, the Prophet of God, that they had been taught the 
truth; it was through him that they had received the power of God 
to perform the ordinances of life and salvation, that he had shown 
them the way of eternal life, and he asked them why they were going 
back upon these wonderful truths. Even the man who converted 
John Taylor in Canada was being affected by the many things that 
had been said. John Taylor met him and said to him that the gospel 
was the same now as when he had preached it in Canada and that it 
did not make any difference what man might do, yet the gospel of 
Jesus Christ was true. Thus Brother Taylor testified to him, and that 
man, be it to his honor, returned again. He had not left the Church, 
but he returned again to his full fellowship and died a faithful member 
of this Church. That same man, President John Taylor, died away 
from home, away from the love of his dear ones. In a letter written to 
his children and to his friends gathered in the Gardo House on the 
first day of November, 1886, he pleaded with his children and with 
his wives to live true to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He 
thanked the brethren for being present upon his birthday and celebrat- 
ing that day in his honor. He gave up his life for the testimony of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ which he knew to be true. 

When the Prophet Joseph was in Carthage jail, Willard Richards 
and other men were there with him. On the day of the martyrdom, in 
talking to some of these men, the Prophet Joseph wanted them to leave 
Carthage jail. He knew what would be his end. It may be true, my 
brethren and sisters, that in the heat of battle we are willing to give up 
our lives for a thing that we hold dear, but this man, Joseph Smith, 
knew for some years previous to the time that he was martyred that 
he should give his life for the testimony that he had received. In a 
letter written to John C. Bennett in 1840, Joseph Smith, in describing 
Nauvoo, said to him that if their enemies would leave them there long 
enough Nauvoo would become one of the most beautiful cities upon the 
banks of the Mississippi. In a meeting held in April, 1842, in talking 
to the Relief Society, Joseph Smith said that he would not be with 
them very long. He said that the people of the world would hear his 
voice only for a short time. On the 6th 'day of August, 1842, when 
he uttered that wonderful prophecy concerning the people coming into 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



these Rocky Mountains, he did not say "I will go with you," but he 
said : "You will go into the valleys of the Rocky Mountains." When 
incarcerated in Carthage jail he realized that the end was near, and 
he desired that his brethren should not remain with him there. He 
tried to get Hyrum to leave him, but that faithful brother would not 
go. He asked Willard Richards to go but Willard turned to him and 
said : "Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with 
you. You did not ask me to come to Carthage — you did not ask me 
to come to jail with you, and do you think I would forsake you now :" 
But I will tell you what I will do, if you are condemned to be hung 
for treason, I will die for you." That was the faith of that man — 
willing to sacrifice his life for the Prophet of the living God. 

We are not called upon, brethren and sisters, to sacrifice our 
lives for this gospel, but are we willing to sacrifice a little of our 
time in our block teaching, in our High Council work, in Sunday 
schools and in other opportunities that are given to us to serve God? 
Are we willing to go into the homes of the Saints and preach unto 
them the gospel of Jesus Christ? Are we willing to lay our all upon 
the altar of God, if necessary, and if called upon to do so? I firmly 
believe, my brethren and sisters, that if Joseph Smith at the last 
moment even, had said to the people that he alone was responsible for 
this Church, that he alone was responsible for the coming forth of the 
Book of Mormon, that they would have ceased their persecutions 
against him and would have heralded him as one of the greatest men 
that had ever lived. They would have considered the Book of Mor- 
mon as the greatest piece of literature that had ever been given in the 
English language. I firmly believe that, my brethren and sisters. 
But because he was true and faithful to the testimony that God had 
given unto him, that he had seen God, that he had seen Jesus Christ, 
that angels of the living God had come to him and had given unto 
him the keys of the dispensations that they held, making him the 
prophet of the dispensation of the fulness of times, they ridiculed the 
Book of Mormon, they made fun of him, and finally took his life. 
But what an example of courage and bravery he has given to the 
world, dying for the testimony that he knew that the work he had 
founded was the work of God and not of man. 

I am thoroughly converted, my brethren and sisters, to work, work 
in the Church of God, to do the things that are required of us ; and I 
believe then that the Lord will bless us with health and with strength 
to carry on his great purposes. Men in these days in which we live 
have also shown themselves to be courageous to the faith that comes 
to them as children. My own father, when he was a boy not more 
than fourteen years of age, was an elder in the Church of Jesus Christ, 
preaching the gospel to the people in his native land, Denmark. On 
one occasion he went into the home of a certain rich man. This man 
thought a great deal of him and offered him the greatestest temptation 



ELDER A. WILLIAM LUND 



79 



that could be placed in the path of my beloved father — that of an 
education. He offered to put him in school, to educate him and to 
make him the heir of all he owned if he would renounce "Mor- 
monism." But that boy, having the faith and testimony of Jesus 
Christ, refused to give up the pearl of great price. He had found 
the truth, and he lived faithful always to that testimony that was 
given to him as a boy. On his death bed, the last words that he gave 
unto his children were that they should remain true to the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. I only hope we all may be true to this wonderful 
gospel. I know that the Priesthood of God is here upon the earth, 
that the keys of this Priesthood are vested in the President of this 
Church, Heber J. Grant. I know him to be a prophet of the living God. 
When I came to England as a missionary, President Grant was the 
President of the European mission. I was appointed to labor in the 
Newcastle conference. There was a certain woman living in one of 
the towns in that conference who was afflicted with deafness, and she 
desired that President Grant should administer unto her. He did 
not have time, because of other conference appointments, to go to 
the town where she resided, but he promised the elders that if they 
would administer to that woman that she would be healed ; and I bear 
you my testimony that his words were fulfilled, that the elders did 
lay their hands upon the head of that woman and she received her 
hearing. These things, my brethren and sisters, are faith-promoting 
to me. They testify to me that the Spirit of God is with the men who 
are. at the head of our Church. The Priesthood of God is the greatest 
thing that has been given to us. In it is the greatest and most glorious 
opportunity given to young men to exercise authority in the saving of 
souls. And no matter what may be said, I bear you my humble 
witness that these men do hold this Priesthood and are the leaders of 
the Church and Kingdom, of God. May God bless you, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DON C. RUSHTON 

Former President of the Australian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, it is the greatest event of my life to be 
called upon to stand here before you and bear my testimony to the work 
of the Lord, as I have taken part in it in the different parts of the 
world where I have been called to labor. I feel very timid and humble 
today, in facing this great audience, for I have not been accustomed 
to meeting with so many people at one time, but I do feel very grateful 
to the Lord for the splendid opportunity we have had of meeting in 
this conference and of listening to the testimonies of those who have 
been chosen to lead this people. 

I have been out in the land of Australia for about four years at 
this time, and three years some time back, laboring with an excellent 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



people, a people who have many of the virtues and good qualities that 
are found among the races in the different parts of the world. They 
are principally from the British Isles, having gone over to Australia, 
a very fruitful land, a land capable of supporting many millions of 
the world's inhabitants ; but it has not been consecrated, seemingly, by 
the Lord. I was listening to the testimonies of Brother Roberts and 
Brother McMurrin today, in explanation of the work which is being 
done on this continent, and of the testimony that had been given of the 
consecration of this land in the early days by the prophets, inspired of 
the Lord, and of how these prophecies have come to pass and been 
fulfilled, and I thought of the land of Australia. It seems that that 
land has no great destiny for the children of men. 

There are no traditions about its early inhabitants. When Captain 
Cook discovered the land he found there a dark-skinned race of people. 
They were estranged to all other races, it seems, resembling, to some 
extent, the African, but yet not like them. They were different from 
any of the other races that he found upon the South Pacific islands, 
and he considered the land at that time was not inhabitable for the 
white man. It lay in that condition for many years, until England 
took charge of it, and that country began to send over their offenders 
to that part of the world, political transgressors. Men and women 
who were not in favor, altogether, of the royalty of the English 
government were sent over, and left in the country of Australia. It 
is a great continent and is as large as the United States. Our work 
there is greatly divided. The nearest conference we have to Sidney, 
the headquarters, is six hundred miles, and the farthest one away is 
three thousand miles, so that we have to travel six thousand miles to 
visit the conference in West Australia. We have about eleven hun- 
dred members of the Church in that land divided into six conferences, 
including the Island of Tasmania. 

This great country has only a population of about seven million 
people. It is capable of supporting twice that many, but for some 
reason the people are not going there. The government of Australia 
is doing everything it can to induce men to come there, but they 
will not come in sufficient numbers ; while this country of America 
is doing everything it can to stop them from coming here. So we 
observe the great difference. Australia is a fruitful land, and one 
where conditions are better than they are in nearly any other part 
of the world, but the country cannot get population sufficient to supply 
the demands, while America, crowded with people to some extent, can- 
not keep them out. 

Brethren and sisters, the words and the blessings of the prophets 
are sure to come to pass. I was thinking of the blessings which pre- 
vailed at the time when Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau. You remember 
how Jacob bought Esau's birthright, and in order that he might attain 
to the blessings, he had to deceive his father, Isaac, but he deceived 



ELDER DON C. RUSHTON 



81 



him and obtained the blessing, and that blessing came to pass. Again, 
when Jacob was blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, he crossed his hands 
when blessing those two sons, and while Joseph tried to remove his 
father's right hand and place it on the head of Manasseh, Jacob said, 
"No." All of these blessings came to pass, and while some of us 
think that it was not altogether fair that Jacob should obtain the 
blessing, yet it was pronounced upon his head by the prophet, a man 
authorized of God, and sent of God, and it came to pass. And so it 
was with Jacob when he blessed the sons of Joseph. He blessed them 
that they should inhabit this great land that we are in, and the Lord 
has sanctified it by his prophets; and so we find it today the best land, 
a land where everyone wishes to come, a land where everyone desires 
to remain, a land where those who have lived here and go away always 
wish to return again — in fulfilment of the prophecies which have 
been made and the blessings which have been given by God. 

We find that the land of Australia has no great destiny, and be- 
cause of that, perhaps, the people of the world are not going there. 
But there is a great people living there, a people who are susceptible 
to the gospel, a people, however, whose minds have been poisoned 
against the truth by the stories which are circulated, and by the false- 
hoods which have been told ; but whenever we have opportunity to 
remove these falsehoods, to show the light that God has given to the 
world and the gospel plan, and to get men to investigate our message, we 
have found friends. They do not always receive the gospel. You 
know it requires quite an effort to receive this gospel, because one has 
'to give up a few things of the world ; but we have a great many 
friends in Australia, and the government is friendly towards us. 

We undertook to erect a Church there a little over a year and a- 
half ago. When we began building, the ministers of the neighbor- 
hood in which we were going to locate the Church were very much 
alarmed, and they got up a huge petition among the people of the 
neighborhood and the ministers all over the city of Melbourne, a city 
of a million inhabitants, against the "Mormon" people erecting a 
Church in Melbourne ; and so an investigation was entered into by the 
government. They called upon us to furnish the evidence of what we 
intended to do when we had that temple as they called it, erected, for 
they think that the Latter-day Saints do not build anything but temples. 
Of course, we had to produce the evidence of what we believed in, 
and what would take place at this building after we had succeeded in 
erecting it, and as a result we presented the gospel before the govern- 
ment of Australia, and we preached the gospel to them. They read 
our gospel publications, they read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine 
and Covenants, and the Articles of Faith, and some scientific works 
by some of our leaders, and those who have written the message of 
truth to the world in this day ; and as a result they told us to go ahead 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and build our Church, they did not see any objections whatever. I 
also had the pleasure of explaining to them the fruits of our gospel 
wherever our people go. I asked them to investigate what had taken 
place in Canada where our people had gone and colonized. I asked them 
to investigate the conditions which prevailed at one time when the 
"Mormon" people lived in Mexico. I asked them, the question if it 
should not be right and proper that we might be able to found such 
colonies and a people who loved liberty and who lived the laws of 
good government, and who upheld industry, and who lived a temper- 
ate, moral life. I asked them if Australia could be injured by a class 
of people of that kind, and they said : "We want that class of people." 
I said : "You will find them among the Latter-day Saints, and if 
you desire further information, come and learn what our purposes 
are and what our people are wanting to do for the world." So it was 
not difficult for them to see our position. I also told them that we 
had been there for forty years or more preaching the gospel, and that 
we had brought into their country thousands of pounds of money 
from our own country, for we all pay our own expenses, and we have 
never asked Australia for one cent of money. I asked them if there 
was any other set of ministers in all their land who taught the gospel 
and paid their own way and brought their money into that country? 
They said : "Why, from a business standpoint you are the most useful 
men and the best m'en we have in the country." And so they told 
us to go ahead and erect our Church, and we did, and we have erected 
two others since then, and the Lord is opening the way and removing 
the prejudice. We have had a hard fight with the picture films. They 
sent pictures all through that country maligning this people, and we 
had to meet them, and did meet them and succeeded in removing a 
great deal of the prejudice. 

Time will not permit me to go on further telling you any more 
at this time, but I pray that the Lord will pour out his Spirit upon 
this people. I know that he will if we will live the gospel. I know 
that the prayers of these men who have been called to lead Israel are 
answered. I have seen it demonstrated many times. The elders that 
come into the field, upon whose heads the authorities of the Church 
have laid their hands, have those blessings fulfilled to the very letter, 
and the Lord is with them ; The Lord is inspiring and leading and 
directing this great work. 

Now, brethren and sisters, may the Lord continue to bless us, 
and bless the world that they may hear the gospel, that the predictions 
that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world may 
soon come to pass ; for the time of the end is drawing near. May the 
youth of Zion arise, and may they hold forth and hold up to the 
high standard of their noble sires. May we still hold up that great 
example of righteousness and industry and honesty and fidelity which 
they demonstrated and which has made this people what they are today, 



ELDER DON C. RUSHTON

and made possible this great gathering of this conference, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I doubt very much whether President Penrose will be with us 
tomorrow. I feel in my heart that it will be wisdom for him not to make 
the attempt. We all know his marvelous and wonderful will power 
and his determination to be with us, but in view of his weakened condi- 
tion I almost feel that it would be tempting Providence for him to be 
here tomorrow. He sent word that he expects to be hereybut I am 
in hopes he will change his mind. We have him in mind as we sing 
this magnificent hymn. Few men in all the world have written any- 
thing finer in our day or in any other day than the many splendid hymns 
that Charles W. Penrose has written :

The congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 
Elder William D. Hanks, President of the Union stake of Zion, 
pronounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

On Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, October 5, 1924, all seats in 
the Tabernacle were occupied and every available standing space was 
filled. Many were unable to gain admittance. All the aisles in the 
gal'eries and on the main floor of the building were occupied. Barratt 
Hall was provided with a radio, and in the Assembly Hall there was an 
overflow meeting at which Elder John M. Knight, president of the 
Western states mission, presided. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." 

The conference was opened by prayer by Elder Joseph R. Shepherd, 
president of the Logan Temple. 

The hymn, "An angel from on high," was sung by Mrs. Mary 
Ellsworth and Mary Lindsay and the choir. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Parley P. Pratt has written more inspirational hymns for the 
Latter-day Saints to sing than any of the other of our poets ; and 
there are few, if any, of his hymns that touch my heart more than 
this wonderful hymn to which we have just listened, so beautifully 
rendered by our sisters and the choir. It was written by inspiration, 
and, to my mind, if we omit the last verse, the wonderful prayer, con- 
tained in this hymn, is marred and lost. There has never been any 
doubt in the minds of the Latter-day Saints that Jerusalem will be 
rebuilt and re-established, and the prediction contained in this last verse 
is in prospect of being fulfilled. From the day that the British army 
rode into Jerusalem a change has come. We believe absolutely in 
the inspiration of this hymn, and that every word of this last verse will 
be fulfilled: 

"Lo, Israel, filled with joy, shall now be gathered home, 
Their wealth and means employ to build Jerusalem; 
While Zion shall arise and shine, 
And fill the earth with truth divine." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

THE OI.D PATHS AND THE GOOD WAY 

"Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old 
paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your 
souls. Eut they said, We will not walk therein. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 85 



"Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the 
trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. 

"Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. 

"Hear, O earth : behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit 
of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my 
law, but rejected it." — Jer. 6:16-19. 

My brethren and sisters, I stand before you this morning as Elder 
Stephen L. Richards said that he did, yesterday, awed in the presence 
of this great congregation of Latter-day Saints, and in the presence 
of God, our Father who, I know is here by his Spirit. I feel de- 
pendent upon him, dependent upon you, and the exercise of your faith 
in my behalf, to help me during the few moments of time which I 
expect to occupy. 

THE PATHS OF THE LORD 

The way, or path, to which the scripture which I have read refers, 
is the path, or road, in which the Lord desires, and has always desired, 
that his people shall walk. 

THE TRAILS AND PATHS OF MEN 

Roads made by men thread the world. They have many begin- 
nings, and some of them intricate and devious windings before the 
end is reached. Some of them are broad and easy to follow, and - 
converge into other like roads, along which, multitudes constantly travel, 
multitudes who appear to be striving for the same objective, a destina- 
tion which the history of the past shows but few reach. In the begin- 
ning these roads were mere trails. Men knew the direction in which 
they wished to travel, the destination which they desired to reach, 
but no one had traveled the road before them, no trail had been 
blazed, there were no markers to follow, and they went blindly on, 
often to disaster, and sometimes to death. 

In their effort to reach the Pacific coast, less than one hun- 
dred years ago, people perished from thirst, when there was water 
in abundance near. No one had been over the road before them, and 
they perished in the deserts of sand, because there was no track to 
follow. 

Today no man would attempt to reach Utah from Santa Fe 
by the route traveled by Cardenas more than three hundred years ago, 
we have learned that the Grand Canyon of the Colorado interposes 
an insurmountable barrier, a barrier which cannot be crossed, but 
know that there are other trails which make the passage of the great 
canyon and river possible. No party of travelers would attempt to 
reach the Pacific Coast by the route followed by the company of 
emigrants who perished in Death Valley, in 1849. 

The impassable barriers, and relentless death traps have become 
known, the roads and trails have been charted, and the wayfarer, 
knowing his danger, avoids them. 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The roads built by man are constructed to satisfy the demands 
of his environment. Over them he carries his commerce, they bring 
into close relationship remote communities and add greatly to his 
pleasure, convenience and comfort. They have become so well de- 
fined that they may be traveled with perfect safety and confidence, 
for from the starting point to our destination the way is plainly marked, 
though it take us to the other side of the world. 

ONE ROAD WHICH MEN HAVE NOT DESIRED TO FOLLOW 

There is one road which the great majority of mankind have 
never, as yet, cared to follow, notwithstanding the fact that the destina- 
tion to which it leads is more desirable than any other. Since the 
earliest period of the existence of man, so far as we have record of his 
existence, the way has been plainly marked, and the destination to 
which the road leads well understood, but men have said, we will 
not walk therein. 

Since the beginning of time, as we count it, men have shown 
by their works, that from the influences and teachings of the remote 
past, the conviction has prevailed that birth into this life is not the 
beginning of the existence of man, nor is death the end of it. The 
people of the world, whether civilized or savage, so far as my per- 
sonal observation and study enable me to judge, have always found 
some outward means of expression, by which their faith in the in- 
visible is shown. It may be by worship of the forces of nature, the sun, 
the moon or stars, or they may bow down to images of wood, or stone 
or gold. In whatever form, this worship is but the expression of faith 
in the intangible forces in which man believes, and to which he ac- 
knowledges his debt of allegiance and service. 

PERPETUITY OF PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENT DEPENDENT 
ON RELTGIOUS FAITH 

I know of no great nation of antiquity which did not have, in con- 
nection with its system of civil government, a code of ethics which 
embraced in its doctrines, and had for its purpose, the ends which 
we moderns seek in the. various forms of religion which we believe 
in and practice. The perpetuity of the various forms of government 
which prevailed was dependent, as all governments are, entirely upon 
the ethical, or religious faith and practice of the people, for, if we are 
to judge by the history of the past, without the higher ideals of 
ethical life, applied in the administration of civil affairs, no nation 
can long survive. 

The earth on which we dwell was designed by the Creator to 
be the home of man; and, for the benefit and blessing of his children, 
the Lord plainly marked the path, or way in which they should travel. 
He taught them that, being the Former of the universe, and Father 
of the spirits of all men, holding dominion over the earth, and all that 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



87 



pertains to it, that we, in appreciation of the blessings which we enjoy, 
should acknowledge our obligation to the Giver, by obedience to bis 
will and reverence to his laws. 

We know that our sojourn in this life is but transitory, that we 
must pass from mortality, and the Lord has taught us that by observance 
of certain simple laws which he has given, or by traveling in the road 
which he has marked out we may find our way back into his presence, 
where, if our conduct in mortality justifies, we will be crowned with 
glory, immortality, and eternal life. 

We have but limited knowledge of the hand-dealing of the Lord 
with the ante-diluvian people, but sufficient is preserved to show that, 
notwithstanding the fact that he sent prophets among them, who warned 
them of the judgments to come, because of their transgression, they 
refused to listen, the result being that when the flood came they 
perished in their sins. 

One would suppose that the dreadful experience through which 
these people passed would have been sufficient to have impressed the 
sons of Noah, who were among the survivors, that they never would 
have forgotten, but it was but a short time after they became established 
on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris when they had so far for- 
gotten their obligation to the Lord, their Father and deliverer, that in 
his anger he confounded their language and scattered them abroad 
on the face of the earth. 

A GREAT EVENT, AND A MIGHTY PURPOSE FORETOLD 

It was at this time that an event occurred which was of great 
importance to us, we people who are permitted to live in this, the 
greatest dispensation of the history of the world, in this land which 
is choice above all other lands. Foreseeing that the people of Babylon 
and Nineveh would not repent of their wickedness, and return to his 
service, the Lord took a small company from the great tower which 
was in course of construction, and under the leadership of inspired 
men brought them to this land which we now occupy. 

That knowledge of the redemption which was to come to the human 
family through the infinite atonement which would be made by Jesus 
Christ was possessed from the beginning by the people of the world is 
plainly shown by the scripture, and is particularly emphasized in the 
revelations which have come to the Church in our day. In order that 
this great truth might not be lost sight of, the Lord has, at various 
times, and in divers places, manifested to his servants, either by 
dream or vision, or by personal appearance the importance and in- 
dispensable necessity of faith in it. It naturally followed that with 
the renewal of the old covenant, with the small body of people, whom 
he designed to bring to a new world, he should again make clear to 
them this great truth, by which their lives were to be governed, either

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for their blessing or condemnation, and this he did to the brother of 
Jared, under the following circumstances: 

THE GREAT TRUTH MADE CLEAR BY REVELATION 

While engaged in prayer the voice of the Lord came to him, as 
follows : 

"Believest thou the words which I shall speak? 

"And he answered; Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for 
thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie. 

"And when he had spoken these words, behold the Lord showed himself 
to him, and said : Because thou knowest these things thou art redeemed from 
the fall ; therefore ye are brought back into my presence ; therefore I show 
myself unto you. Behold I am he who was prepared from the foundation of 
the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. In me shall all 
mankind have light, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my 
name; and they shall become my sons and daughters. 

"And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for 
never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created 
after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after 
mine own image. 

"Behold, this body, which you now behold, is the body of my spirit; and 
man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear to 
thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh." 

RESULTS OF AN ANCIENT WARNING UNHEEDED 

By this we see, my brethren and sisters, that more than two 
thousand years before he manifested himself in the flesh Christ showed 
himself to this man, that a witness might be had among the people 
of his existence and future ministry among men. Before this people 
reached the American continent the Lord warned them of the conse- 
quence of disobedience, and made known the conditions upon which 
they were dependent, either for success or failure, after their arrival 
here. Let me read: 

"And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea 
in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth, even unto 
the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the 
Lord God had preserved for a righteous people. 

"And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, 
should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when 
the fulness of his wrath should come upon them. 

"And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land that 
it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve 
God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come 
upon them.- And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are 
ripened in iniquity. 

"For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; where- 
fore he that does possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is 
the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity 
among the children of the land, that they are swept off. 

"And this cometh to you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees 
of God, that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W . WINS 



89 



fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God 
upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it 
shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." 

It is sufficient at this time to state that, notwithstanding this 
admonition, and the many manifestations of the power and mercy of the 
Lord, which were had .among them, the Jaredites refused to walk in 
the way that the Lord had marked out, went into transgression, and 
finally, through war and contention, ceased to exist as a nation. 

More than one thousand years after the Jaredites were led away 
from, the tower of Babel, the Lord again brought a small colony of 
people from the old world, this time from Jerusalem, and established 
them in America, a people known, and referred to in the records which 
they kept, as the Nephites. 

To them the Lord repeated the promise which he had made to the 
Jaredites : He would lead them to a choice land, which should be 
their inheritance, and great prosperity would attend them on one con- 
dition, namely, that they should be devoted to the God of the land, 
who is Jesus Christ. The doctrine of the atonement was revealed to 
them, and after his resurrection the Redeemer appeared, and organized 
his Church among them. For two hundred years after the organization 
of the Church the Nephite people enjoyed a great degree of peace, 
prosperity and happiness, but like the Jaredites before them, they re- 
fused to walk in the old paths, and when the prophets whom the Lord 
raised up warned them that the road in which they were traveling 
would lead to' disaster, and that the way of the Lord was so plainly 
marked that a wayfarer, though a fool, need not err, they said, We 
will not walk therein. When the watchmen said, Hear the sound of 
the trumpet, which calls you back to the old way, they said, We will 
not listen. Disobedience resulted, as it always has, in loss of the birth- 
right which the Lord had given them, and the destruction of another 
nation which might, if obedient, have continued until the present. 

MODERN DISCOVERY OF AMERICA 

This brings us to another epoch, or dispensation, of greater im- 
portance to us, to the world at large, than any which has preceded 
it. Another period of one thousand years had elapsed. When the 
Lord inspired Columbus to sail away from 1 Spain, and directed him 
to the shores of the New World, the first step had been taken in 
the opening of the greatest gospel dispensation which the world has 
ever known, a dispensation looked forward to by the prophets of old, 
in which the Lord said that he would consummate his work, and 
prune his vineyard for the last time, when the wheat was to be garnered, 
and the tares bound in bundles, and burned. 

By natural means, as the Lord always operates for the accomplish- 
ment of his purposes, means so simple that the thoughtless and un- 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



believing do not see the manifestation of his power, he brought the 
Puritans from the old world to New England, the Dutch to New York, 
the English Cavaliers to Virginia and the French to New Orleans, 
a combination of races which, paradoxical as it may appear, was just 
calculated to give us the composite America who made the United 
States of America what it is, the greatest nation of the world today. 

Inspired men have been raised up, who have given us our form 
of government, and the code of laws by which we are controlled, the 
best ever evolved by man, so far as we are able to judge. The Lord 
has strengthened the arms of the patriots who have defended us against 
the assults of all those who have come up against us, and delivered 
us until today, from those who would have torn us asunder. Against 
all opposition, I sometimes think almost against ourselves, the Lord 
has brought us to our present condition, until this nation, like a city 
set on a hill, has become the light of the world. 

ARE WE TO PROFIT BY PAST EXPERIENCES? 

I have gone hastily over the history of the past, which brings us 
to the present, to us the most important period of the world's history, 
because it is our day, the day in which the conduct of world affairs, 
with which we are directly associated has been entrusted to us, when 
we are to prove whether or not we are to benefit by the experiences of 
the past, avoiding the pitfalls into which our predecessors have fallen, 
and profiting by the markers which they have placed along the road 
which leads to happiness and success, while we avoid those which the 
experience of the past teach us inevitably lead to disappointment and 
failure. 

ALL INSTITUTIONS AND INTERESTS DEPENDENT ON THE STABILITY 
OF GOVERNMENT 

The welfare of the Church, and every other interest and institution 
of our country is dependent upon the stability of our civil government, 
by which our every interest is controled. There is nothing which we 
call our own, not even our lives, which is not subject to its demands. 
However much we may resist or say we will not, it compels sub- 
mission. 

Our government can be no better than its citizenship, since the 
men who frame and execute the laws are chosen from among the body 
of the people, and consequetnly reflect the character of the majority 
of the electorate. 

IT IS TIME WE TAKE NOTE OF THE SIGNBOARDS OF HISTORY 

Has the time come when it is worth while that we pause and 
carefully examine ourselves, when we should take note of the sign 
boards which history has placed along the road which we are traveling? 
Is it worth while to inquire whither this road leads? To listen to the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



91 



pleadings of those who have gone over it before, and know the death 
traps which are scattered all along the way, or shall we go blindly 
on ignoring the experiences of the past, until chaos shall come to us 
as it has come to those who have occupied this choice land before ? 

I have gone back over the road which leads to Babylon and 
Nineveh, to Thebes and Memphis, to Tyre and Sidon, to Greece and 
Rome, and all along the way have seen these words of warning blazed 
in the tree-trunks, and cut into the face of the rocks — Beware of lack 
of faith in a living God. Beware of selfishness, of personal ambition, 
of pride, of love of power and dominion, of disregard for the honor 
of men, and the virtue of women, for the end of this road is dis- 
appointment and death. 

I believe that every soul present desires the perpetuity of our 
government. It would be a source of sorrow to know that there is 
a person here who is not willing to give his all that this desired end 
may be achieved. If this is to be accomplished we must avoid the 
road which those who have gone before have followed. I fear, as I 
contemplate our present condition, that some of the paths in which we 
are walking, if we continue to follow them, will lead us into the broad 
road from which few turn back, once they have entered into it. 

OUR NEGLECTS AND SERIOUS TRANSGRESSIONS 

Our reverence toward our Father and God is not manifested in our 
lives as it should be. Instead of honoring his holy name, as we should, 
we openly and unblushingly profane it, notwithstanding the fact that 
he has told us that we should not take his name in vain, and that he 
who does so will not be found guiltless. 

We are told that only the simple minded and uninformed believe 
in or practice the doctrine of prayer, and this world-old command 
of the Lord, this principle which opens the gates of heaven, and brings 
us into communion with the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, 
has been almost entirely eliminated from the American home, and is 
no longer regarded as a necessary, or even proper part of our public 
school system. 

We loudly acclaim our devotion to, and love for American ideals, 
and pose as patriotic, law-abiding citizens, while the very men who 
enact our laws, and are appointed to enforce them, too often violate 
the law, and the trust reposed in them, as if they were exempt 
from that which they require others to obey. Our trusted agents who 
have the management of our public affairs, too often prove themselves 
to be rouges and swindlers by uniting with the men whom they profess 
to detect and prosecute, to rob us of that which, they are employed to 
protect. 

Men, profound in their knowledge of the law, too often use their 
great learning, not to uphold and magnify the law, but to pervert it, 
and find means by which we may avoid its just requirements. Self

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



confessed criminals, guilty of the most heinous crimes, premediated in 
their execution, are turned loose upon defenseless, law-abiding com- 
munities, to continue their criminal practices upon those whom the 
law is designed to protect. 

IN THESE TRANSGRESSIONS WE ARE TRAVELING THE BLAZED 
TRAILS TO DEATH 

We are rapidly converting the Sabbath day, which should be 
observed as a day of rest and devotion, into one of pleasure, rather 
than worship. Are we becoming lovers of pleasure, rather than lovers 
of God? If so, we are traveling in one of those blazed trails which 
lead to death, rather than life. 

GOD HAS REVEALED HIS WAY; WILL WE WALK THEREIN? 

I bear this witness : That in the age in which we live the Lord has 
again revealed himself to man. He has again marked the road in 
which we should walk. It is the old way, and the voice of the pro- 
phets of the Lord has been heard calling upon the people to walk in 
it for nearly one hundred years. The sound of the trumpet has been 
heard, but men have said, We will not walk in the road marked out, 
neither will we listen to the sound of the trumpet which calls us back 
from the broad road which we are following. 

GOD'S PATH, DECREE AND WILL REVEALED. WILL THE PEOPLE HEARKEN ? 

The decree of the Almighty regarding this land is in force today, 
as it was in the days of the Jaredites, and the Nephites. It is an ever- 
lasting decree, and we, as other peoples who have occupied this choice 
land, must be governed by it or suffer the consequence. Let me con- 
clude my remarks by reading briefly from the Book of Mormon. 
This is the scripture of the American continent, the destiny of this 
land is outlined in it as in no other book. The road, or way, is plainly 
marked, no one need err who will follow the blazed trail. It is a 
straight and narrow way, but easy to follow, notwithstanding the 
many cross roads which intercept it. All of the danger points have 
been charted, and the way of safety plainly shown. 

The man who sealed up this record, and through whom it came 
to us, said : 

"And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth — that if the day cometh 
that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be 
because of unbelief. 

"And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case. * * * 
1 exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that 
ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; And 
the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, 
which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even 
as one speaking out of the dust? * * * And God shall show unto you, that 
that which I have written is true. 

"And again I would exhort you that you would come unto Christ, and 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



93 



lay held upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean 
thing. * * * 

"And now I bid you all farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of 
God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth 
triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great 
Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

My brethren and sisters, I suppose one could never grow old 
enough, at least I never expect to, to get entirely over stage fright. 
This is the third day that I have been sitting before this congregation, 
not knowing at what hour I might be called upon; and when one has 
gone through that experience for two or three days the stage fright 
becomes accentuated. 

It is recorded of Thomas Carlyle, who could not do his thinking 
if there were any great noise about, that he had a neighbor, a lady, 
who kept some chickens ; and the crowing of the roosters was a 
source of annoyance to him. He sent a kind letter to his neighbor and 
offered to buy the chickens so that he might kill them. She refused to 
let him have them, and said : "Besides I don't see why they bother you. 
The roosters crow only at stated intervals." He replied : "Yes, madam, 
that is true; but you don't know what I suffer waiting for them to 
crow." 

I am indeed awed in the presence of this great multitude. My 
soul is subdued before this wonderful gathering, this splendid con- 
gregation, composed of men and women who are among the choicest 
of the earth. To stand before you and try to counsel, advise, or 
instruct is a responsibility which makes one feel his own insignificance. 
Except I have the Spirit of the Lord to assist me, I can be of little 
service in this position. I pray, therefore, for your sympathy and 
faith, and for the assistance of that same Spirit which has been given 
to the speakers of this conference up to the present. 

I listened with deep interest to President Grant's report of the 
various activities and work of the Church — its growth and all its splendid 
affairs of which we heard in the opening of our conference. The 
building of temples and their maintenance and operation take a sub- 
stantial part of the means of the Church. Here we maintain the Temple 
and these beautiful grounds. I hope you will not fail to walk around 
this block and see if you can get out of it a thrill such as has come 
to me during the last week, as I have looked upon its beauty and have 
thought of the pleasure that it must afford to the visitors within our 
gates. All this is kept up at the expense of the Church, and it costs 
a good deal of money. The free organ recitals, given every day 
to the strangers — and to those of our home people, as well, who choose 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to go — are paid for by the Church; as also is the care of the organ, 
the upkeep of this building and these grounds, and it all costs quite a 
sum of money. 

Then, there are further expenditures for the building and meeting- 
houses, as the President called to our attention, and as Brother Rushton 
from Australia told us yesterday. They are spending considerable 
means for this purpose down in Australia; and we were also told 
by President Grant of large sums of money being spent for the building 
of places of worship in Sweden, in Norway, in Rotterdam, and in the 
cities of the eastern part of the United States. President Roberts 
told us of the chapels that have been built in Baltimore, and at other 
places in his mission; and, indeed, over all the face of the earth — 
in practically all of the civilized world, we may say — these activities 
of the Church are being conducted, and it takes a large, a very large, 
amount to carry them on. 

Where does all this money come from? It is the tithes you pay, 
and I pay, that the people of this Church contribute year by year. I 
am in a position to announce to you, and I feel it my duty to do so, 
that the means you pay, the money you contribute as tithing, all that 
comes into the hands of the Trustee-in-Trust, is expended in a judicious, 
wise, and righteous way; and only in the interests, the best interests, 
of the building up of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I am in a position to know this, and I testify of it to you this morning. 

My brethren and sisters, the question I want to put to you, and 
to myself also, is this : Have you and I done our share in this respect? 
Are we doing our full duty in assisting in the building up of this work? 
Are we helping to keep missionaries in the field? Is it our means that 
help to extend this work in the wonderful way that it is being ex- 
tended ? If not, then this spiritual power, this force, has not yet gripped 
you and me sufficiently to make us know that our duty is to pay our 
tithes— the full amount the Lord requires — and to do it when the means 
come into our hands ; not to wait until the end of the year, because then 
we may not have it. It is true that we are instructed to make settle- 
ment annually, paying one-tenth of our interest, and we should see 
that it is paid annually, and make our settlement annually ; but the 
time for us to pay our tithes and to contribute to this work, to help 
it grow and to be partakers in it, not only in words, but in deeds as 
well, is when we have the money in our hands, when it comes to us. 
I know that I was brought up strictly in respect to this matter, for 
my good old mother did not wait until she made ten pounds of butter 
before one pound of it was paid to the bishop. We had no money in 
those early days, but we gave butter, eggs, potatoes, wheat and hay — 
all that the earth produced. She did not wait until she got ten pounds 
before she paid one. No, she paid it from among the first, to get 
the tithing debt off her hands. If there were a dozen eggs, or two 
dozen, or five dozen, the tithing, and a little more than the tithing, 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



95 



went to the bishop at once. So I say, that this is a good example for 
me, and a good example for you. When the means come into our 
hands, let us pay our tithing then and not wait, perhaps until the 
means have been dissipated. 

This Church, with its varied activities, tends to build up the com- 
munities in this country. Our Chamber of Commerce, in Salt Lake 
City, is asking for seventy-five thousand dollars in donations — what 
for? To advertise Utah. And what is the purpose of advertising 
Utah? To bring settlers here to make homes and to build up the 
communities. Well, that is a good thing. I contribute to that, as do 
many of you who live here. But this Church has two thousand mis- 
sionaries, or about that number, in the field all the time, who are 
preaching this gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and who are winning 
souls to it. While they do not encourage those people to come im- 
mediately to Utah, or to this country, yet, as soon as these converts hear 
about the Temple of the Lord, as soon as the Spirit of the Lord and ihe 
spirit of this work get into their hearts, the spirit of gathering is there, 
and you cannot hold them back, whether they are in Germany, or 
Switzerland, or Norway, or in the United States, or wherever they are. 
They want to come to Zion, and our difficulty is to keep them from 
coming too quickly. Now, if it is a good thing for the country and for 
the city that we spend money to bring people here, isn't this Church 
one of the best institutions for the merchant, for the business man, 
and for other interests? For the people that we bring here are of a 
class who want to build and own their own homes, and who do that 
very thing. In a little while they are established on the land, and they 
make the best of citizens. 

It is safe to say that the means we spend every year in beautifying 
this block contribute more to the renown and glory of Salt Lake City 
than almost all the money that is spent elsewhere; and this money is 
contributed by you Latter-day Saints ; it comes from your tithes ; and 
it is good advertising; it is good work. We should not be ridiculed 
for it ; we should rather be commended for it and blessed for it. This 
conference gathering every six months brings thousands of people here. ' 
I wonder whether that is not a good thing for the merchants and the 
business interests of this city. I wonder how these merchants would 
like to have our conferences suspended for a time. You would hear 
something other than criticism if this were clone. You would hear a 
plaint and a wail go up ; so I point out to you, and to the people of this 
State, and to our friends who are not of our faith, that the activities 
in which we are engaged make for the building up of the communities, 
and are a good business proposition in the line of material advancement 
and the betterment of communities, apart from the spiritual benefits 
which we know we receive. All this wealth of means which you con- 
tribute to the Church is expended, as I have said, in the building up of 
the community. This is truly American. 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I rejoice this morning with all my heart that I am a member of 
the Church — this American Church that owes no allegiance to any 
foreign power or potentate, the only real American Church worthy of 
the name. It is American through and through. It was established by 
true-blooded Americans of Pilgrim stock, the best Americans from 
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and the surrounding New 
England states. Such men were the founders of our Church. It is 
American in ideals, American in thought, American in every activity 
connected with it, American in its desire to bless and benefit the people. 
There is not any other church that can claim anything like that. This 
is verified by the men who sit here on this stand, President Grant, 
- George Albert Smith and others, and by those who came before them — 
President Ivins, Elder Smoot and the Clawsons and Whitneys, 
Richards and Lymans — all sons of the American Revolution and leaders 
of this people. They are of the truest blooded American stock that can 
be found in this nation. I would like to have these things pointed out, 
and to let the world know that we are doing some good, that we are 
building up the country, and that the money which comes in as tithes 
is being righteously and properly expended for the advancement of 
the Kingdom of God. 

Again I say, have I done my share? Have you done your share? 
You alone can answer your part of that question. Some of us have 
not. I doubt if I have. We can do a little better; we can do a little 
more. We haven't done quite enough, for this is a great and good work. 
Check up on yourselves and see where you stand. This work cannot 
be conducted merely by preaching. It takes means to do all these 
things that the President has pointed out and that I am trying to re- 
hearse to you, and there are so many, many more, and it takes means 
to do them all. The thought I want to leave with you is this: Have 
we done our full share? If not, why can't we try to do it? for the 
work is just beginning. In all truth, I can say that in its growth and 
development it has scarcely started yet. Let me read from the Book 
of Mormon. In chapter 14 of I Nephi, which I shall not take time 
to read through, there is a reference to the very hymn we sang, written 
by Parley P. Pratt. When you go home read this 14th chapter of 
I Nephi. Among other things that the angel of Lord showed unto 
Nephi was this : 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb 
of God, that it descended upon the saints of the Church of the Lamb, 
and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon 
all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and 
with power of God in great glory." 

Scattered everywhere is this people, building churches, as has 
been pointed out, in the East, in the West, and on the Islands of the 
Sea. It means permanency for the Saints. There will be branches 
of the Church throughout the world. In 1906 I had the pleasure of 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



97 



visiting the Old Country, in company with our late beloved President 
Joseph F. Smith. In the city of Bern, in Switzerland, we held a 
Priesthood meeting one night, at which the power of God was richly 
and truly manifest. President Serge F. Ballif was there and is a 
witness to what I say. Joseph F. Smith said : "Not only will we have 
churches here, but in this land of Europe we will have temples of the 
Lord built here and there, all over the land." That was his prediction. 
I believe it. I believe in this vision of Nephi ; that he saw our people 
scattered in small communities all over the face of the earth. The 
Church of God is permanent. We must build these churches. I have, 
said all along that this Church can spend its money to no better ad- 
vantage than in building meeting-houses in which the people may gather 
together and worship, for this establishes the Church and lends per- 
manency to its operations. 

I see that my time has expired. The Lord bless you, brethren 
and sisters, bless this work, bless his servants, and may we open our 
hearts and say in our heart of hearts, in our very soul: "Yes, I will 
do my share, my full share. I must not miss the opportunity. This 
work is too good, it is too great. The Lord has made me a partaker 
of it, and now shall I be miserly and withhold my assistance?" 

I think it is Brother Golden Kimball who tells the story of his 
father's owning a beautiful horse. Tithing was paid with horses, 
cattle, sheep, and everything obtainable in those days. The hcrse 
Brother Kimball had was a very fine one, and he said to the boys : 
"I believe I will turn that horse in for tithing ; pay it to Bishop Hunter." 
The next morning one of the boys paraded the beautiful animal around 
and wanted to keep it, but President Kimball said: "See here, ycu 
take that horse right down and pay it in for tithing, before my heart 
puckers up." 

Now let us do our share willingly and loyally, before our hearts 
pucker up. God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Charles W. Penrose is hearing everything that is going 
on here this morning, a radio having been installed in his room, and 
he is thoroughly enjoying the morning service. 

Brother David O. McKay, in Europe, is well and happy but 
slightly disappointed that he is soon to return home. He is thor- 
oughly enjoying his missionary work, and I am sure that he would 
really like to remain there until Spring. 

You have probably heard of the great Columbia Basin Irrigation 
Project, the largest contemplated by the United States, up to date. 
Brother Richard R. Lyman has been requested, by the government 
officials, to be present there as one of the consulting engineers, hence 
his absence from this conference. He wrote that he would get excused,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



if possible, but we wired him that we did not care to disappoint his 
associates, and that he was at liberty to remain. He is with us today 
in spirit, and it is a source of sincere regret to him that he is not 
present. 

One of the most remarkable and splendid hymns that we have is 

this : 

"School thy feelings, O my brother, 
Train thy warm impulsive soul." 

This hymn was written by President Charles W. Penrose, at a 
time when he was falsely accused by his brethren, after laboring in the 
British mission for ten long - years without purse or scrip. Upon 
completing his mision, as I understand it, and when he was about to 
go home, these false reports or accusations were made against him, and, 
as he has told me, the Lord gave to him that night, for his own 
consolation, the thoughts of this very wonderful poem. I shall not 
take time to read, or for us to sing, the entire hymn, but I will ask 
the choir and congregation to arise and sing the first verse ; and when 
you go home be sure and read it all. lie sure and get it into your 
hearts. Be sure and make it a part of your lives, and this conference 
will not have been in vain, even if you have heard nothing' else or 
received no other lesson here. It was the favorite hymn of President 
Francis M. Lyman, and he lived his life in perfect accord with the 
teachings of his favorite hymn : 

School thy feelings, O my brother, 

Train thy warm, impulsive soul; 
Do not its emotions smother, 

But let wisdom's voice control. 

School thy feelings; there is power 

In the cool, collected mind; 
Passion shatters reason's tower, 

Makes the clearest vision blind. 

School thy feelings ; condemnation 

Never pass on friend or foe, 
Though the tide of accusation 

Like a flood of truth may flow. 

Hear defense before deciding, 

And a ray of light may gleam, 
Showing thee what filth is hiding 

Underneath the shallow stream. 

Should affliction's acrid vial 

Burst o'er thy unsheltered head, 
School thy feelings to the trial, 

Half its bitterness hath fled. 

Art thou falsely, basely slandered? 

Does the world hegin to frown? 
Gauge thy wrath by wisdom's standard, 

Keep thy rising anger down. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



99 



Rest thyself on this assurance: 

Time's a friend to innocence. 
And that patient, calm endurance 

Wins respect and aids defense. 

Noblest minds have finest feelings 

Quiv'ring strings a breath can move, 
And the Gospel's sweet revealings 

Tune them with the key of love. 

Hearts so sensitively moulded, 

Strongly fortified should be, 
Trained to firmness, and enfolded 

In a calm tranquility. 

Wound not wilfully another; 

Conquer haste with reason's might; 
School thy feelings, sister, brother, 

Train them in the path cf right. 

The choir and congregation sang, "School thy feelings, O my 
brother." 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

"For he taught them as one having authority and not as the 
scribes." 

THE WORDS OF THE BRETHREN 1 RING TRUE 

I have listened with great interest to the remarks that have been 
made by my brethren at the various sessions of this conference. I 
know that their words have rung true, that they have been accom- 
panied with power, with authority, that they have penetrated the hearts 
of the people, and that we have gone from this building at the close 
of each service rejoicing, and bearing witness, one to another, that 
the truth has been declared; and, I believe, with the determination of 
making it more thoroughly a part of our lives when we depart from 
this conference. Truly we have heard the word of the Lord, and it 
has been spoken in power. The counsel, the advice, the instruction 
have been given unto us in authority. There has been no discordant 
note, no uncertain sound, but everything that has been said has been 
said with the conviction of the truth, and we rejoice. 

THE TRUTH GROWS BRIGHTER WITH USE 

Yet nothing has been said that is new. There has been no new 
revelation, no presentation of something that we did not understand, 
nothing that we have not previously been taught, and which had 
previously found a place in our hearts, for the truth endures forever. 
It is always new, it grows brighter with use. We love it the more 
we come in contact with it, which is not the case with falsehood. 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



In one of the revelations given in the early days of the Church, 
the Lord said, speaking of one of the ordinances of the gospel ; that 
he revealed "a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which was 
from the beginning." Those words are very significant. It is new 
because truth does not grow old, and yet was from the beginning, and 
hence must endure through all time, and through eternity; for that 
which is true must remain. 

COMMOTION AND UNREST IN THE WORLD 

Throughout the world today, as we have already been informed by 
a number of the speakers, there is commotion and a spirit of unrest ; 
and the people, many of them, feel that it is something to their credit 
to hold radical views, to consider themselves to be progressive, and 
to make attack upon things that have stood land have endured through- 
out the ages. This tendency is not alone found in the political world. 
It is found in the world of education, of religion, of government, of 
business and everywhere. Men are departing from the well-worn paths, 
no matter how good they are, and feel that conservatism, is a reproach ; 
that it is the duty of man to do away with that which is old, or which 
has been established, and find something that is new. We stand prac- 
tically alone in the world, yes, absolutely alone in the world, represent- 
ing the truth of the living God, declaring to all men the principles of 
eternal truth which do not change. The gospel of Jesus Christ is not 
new in the sense in which the world looks upon things as being new, 
for it has endured through the ages, not merely since the days of the 
advent of the Son of God, but from the beginning of the world, for 
the plan of salvation was prepared for the benefit of man, and declared 
unto him in the beginning. These principles do not change, they can- 
not change, they must endure immutably through all time. 

The Christian world may be divided into two camps, one bitterly 
opposing the other ; one calling itself the progressive or modernist 
division, the other calling itself the fundamentalist division. They 
may think they are founded upon the truth of the gospel as it has been 
established. But we stand for the revelations of God as they have been 
revealed in this dispensation, known as the dispensation of the fulness 
of times, unchangeable, immutable, enduring forever, because they 
are eternal. 

AN ABIDING KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST BRINGS PEACE 

If there is any one thing that brings joy and peace and satisfac- 
tion to the heart of man, beyond anything else that I know of, it is 
the abiding testimony which I have, and which you have, that Jesus 
Christ is the Son of God. That is a truth that cannot be changed. 
Men may attack it ; they may ridicule it ; they may declare that he is 
not the Redeemer of the world, that his mission was not true, or that 
its purpose, through the shedding of his blood, was not to grant unto 
all men the remission of sins on condition of their repentance. They 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



101 



may refuse to be'.ieve in the resurrection from the dead, or even that 
Christ himself came forth, as the Scriptures declare, after he had 
been put to death by his enemies ; nevertheless the truth remains. He 
did die for the sins of the world, he did bring to pass redemption from 
death, he did grant unto men the opportunity of repentance, and re- 
mission of sins through their belief and acceptance of the principles 
of the gospel, and of his mission. These truths are fundamental, they 
shall endure ; they cannot be destroyed no matter what men may say 
or think. Furthermore, the mission of Jesus Christ teaches us that 
there was a time when man departed from the truth, when transgression 
came into the world, and man, through his agency sinned, or violated 
a law, which brought death upon the world. For Christ came to atone 
for sin, to bring again the restitution of life, of peace, of happiness, 
through the things which he suffered. Now anything which is con- 
trary to that is not true. 

THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST FUNDAMENTAL 

I bear witness to that which was said by President Grant at the 
opening session of this conference, that there is no place in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the man who does not accept, 
without reservation, the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, who does 
not believe that his mission in this world was to redeem, to restore, to 
grant again unto man the privilege, through his faith, through his 
repentance, and his worthiness, the opportunity of coming back again 
into the presence of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. If 
there are within the Church those who have these so-called modernist 
tendencies, who deny the miracles of Christ, the miracles of the scrip- 
tures, the doctrines known as the gospel of Jesus Christ, who cannot 
accept him as the Redeemer of the world, then they should repent of 
their sins, for it is within the power, and it is the privilege of each 
individual member of this Church to know the truth for himself, 
through the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost. There need be 
no doubt, no uncertainty, in regard to this matter. The Lord has 
taught us these principles in modern revelation. He declared them 
while in his ministry upon the earth. 

JESUS DECLARED HIMSELF TO BE THE SON T OF GOD 

I know that there are those who make the statement that Christ 
did not declare himself to be the Son of God during his ministry. 
To the contrary, that was the claim he made from the beginning 
of his ministry, and which has been repeated in the revelations that 
have come unto us in this dispensation, one of which I shall read : 

"Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is from all eternity to all 
eternity, the Great I Am, even Jesus Christ — 

"The light and the life of the world ; a light which shineth in darkness and 
the darkness comprehendeth it not; 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"The same which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine 
own received me not; 

"But to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even 
so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons. 

"And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth 
me ; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me. 

"And this is my gospel — repentance and baptism by water, and then cometb 
the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showetli 
all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom." 

TESTIMONY THAT JESUS IS THE CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD 

Those words are true, absolutely true. I bear witness of this fact 
because I know it ; you know it ; and so we stand firmly planted on 
the rock of truth, bearing witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
the living God, and that through him comes redemption from death, 
which passes upon all men irrespective of their belief or their unbelief, 
their acceptance or their rejection of his mission, and also through 
him comes redemption to man from sin on condition of his repentance, 
and endurance to the end. 

May we be faithful and true in the discharge of every duty and to 
the truth which God has revealed unto us, and endure in righteousness 
to the end, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I failed to mention in my opening address that the following 
presidents of stakes have been appointed during the past six months: 
James A. Christensen, North Sevier stake. 
Harry L. Payne, St. Joseph stake. 
Albert H. Belliston, Juab stake. 

I also forgot to mention the fact that we have established, since 
our last conference, a French mission with Russell H. Blood as the 
president. I take it for granted that he is a son of ITenry TT. Blood- - 
I do not know it, but his signature resembles Henry's writing. 

I also failed to mention that we now have a total of ward ;, stakes, 
missions, conferences and branches, of 1,959, or 41 lacking of 2,000. 

Announcements were made by President Heber J. Grant that 
the Sunday School Union would hold their semi-annual conference 
in the Tabernacle this evening at 7 o'clock ; also that a special Priest- 
hood meeting would be held on .Monday morning at 10 o'clock in the 
Assembly Hall. 

An anthem, "The Almighty," was sung by Jessie Williams and 
the choir. 

Elder George A. Little, president of the Oquirrh stake, offered 
the closing prayer, and the conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 



An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the As- 
sembly Hall at 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, October 5, 1924. 

Elder John M. Knight, president of the Western States mission, 
presided. 

Music and singing were furnished by the Seventeenth ward choir, 
of the Salt Lake stake of Zion, Hyrum J. Christensen, chorister ; Tracy 
Y. Cannon, organist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Prayer was offered by Elder David R. Lyon, bishop of the Ensign 
ward, Ensign stake. 

The choir sang, "He died, the great Redeemer died." 

ELDER JOHN Q. ADAMS 

Former President of the Samoan Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, if I display just a little unusual 
nervousness this morning, it is due to a combination of circumstances 
over which I possibly have no control. I have yet to meet with the 
individual who f eels as much at home here in this position as he does 
in his own home. Also in eight and a-half years of missionary expe- 
rience in the Islands, I had three opportunities of addressing an audi- 
ence in my own language. Then, coming to this meeting, we had the 
sad duty of bearing a half-dead lady to St. Mark's hospital, and left 
one gentleman with the spark of life just flickering between this world 
and the next, the result of an accident when a large car went into the 
ditch. Imagine the condition of a person in this frame of mind, who 
has these conflicting emotions. 

I have one thought and hope and desire in my mind, and that is 
that I may still retain a sufficient portion of the Spirit of God that 
what few moments I shall occupy, and what few words I express, 
I may leave you a testimony that I know that above all things and 
beyond all things the gospel of Jesus Christ and its accompanying 
spirit supersedes everything in the world. In order that I should feel 
entirely at home now, I should desire that this house should be trans- 
ferred into a Samoan house — for that is where I spent the eight best 
years of my life — with you sitting on the floor; that before each one 
of you should be a Bible, a Book of Mormon, and Songs of Zion, in 
the native tongue, after the order of a mounted piece of artillery. If 
I should refer to a passage of Scripture, you would not give me time 
to find that in my own Bible, but the first person to find it would 
read it for me. The people always have the Word of God at their 
fingers' tips. In the fractional part of a second the audience can find 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



any passage of scripture in the Bible. It is not often that we can find 
cobwebs upon the books that we have down there, for people are 
using them all the time. 

I do not know that I should refer to any statistics this morning, 
or give you any report that bears very much on figures ; those things we 
get enough of in the daily walks of life. But the mission is pro- 
gressing under the able direction of President Butler. If I could bring 
to you the spirit of the mission field, so that you can feel the spirit that 
your sons and daughters possess who have gone out from your roofs 
to take the gospel out, I shoidd feel satisfied with my effort. They 
are probably gathered together at this hour in conference. I am won- 
dering if you know the conditions of those people attending their con- 
ference session today. The way you came here, there were hardly 
any of you who did not come thirty miles an hour in an automobile 
or on the interurban, overflowing with convenience and comfort ; but 
possibly half the congregation there will have walked between 75 and 
100 miles to attend conference, on the largest island of the group. 
They take a couple of baskets woven from the leaf of the cocoanut 
tree ; in those baskets are their clothes for conference, possibly a little 
food — because some of those lava stretches are 30 or 40 miles in extent, 
with no houses or drinking water. In tramping over those rough lava 
trails for three or four days, carrying their clothing, books, etc., they 
reach conference, and when they reach conference they feel in their 
hearts that they have come for something, and after they have left 
conference, they feel they have attained that objective, and back they 
go over those rough trails to their homes, carrying the spirit of the 
gospel; partaking of the influence of the gospel, having been fed the 
bread of life, and all keyed up and prepared to run another six months. 

You and I, with all of these modern conveniences and luxuries, 
possibly get a little careless, and do not realize and appreciate what 
God has given us. I think we hardly appreciate the gospel as our 
own people out in the world do. It is not a difficult matter there for 
us to get 90%, of our 3,000 membership in the Samoan mission, to 
attend to their duties. If we do not have well up toward 90% in 
attendance at Priesthood or Relief Society meetings, or other auxiliary 
organizations, and Sabbath meetings and Sunday schools, we feel that 
we are slipping; we begin to look at what is wrong — if it is with us or 
with them. Here we do not find the percentage nearly so large. I 
want to bear you my testimony that the more we do in this Church, 
and the greater the inconveniences that God puts us to, the more we 
appreciate it in the end. It is not the young man who is left a legacy 
of a million dollars who appreciates the meaning of that; it is his father, 
who accumulated that fortune by the sweat of his brow. And just so 
it is in a spiritual way. You and I will have to get in and work, before 
we get a full appreciation of what the gospel means. 

The thought strikes me that I should read a little clipping this 
morning, that I think is almost prophetic. When we left for the 



ELDER JOHN Q. ADAMS 105 

mission field five years ago, this had just been published in one of 
the newspapers. One of the most noted correspondents, William T. 
Ellis, received an assignment from some big newspaper syndicate to 
go to the Near East and ascertain the conditions that obtained there 
at the completion of the War. He met with all the notables in a military 
and governmental way, and these few paragraphs are what he has writ- 
ten with reference to that : 

"It was but a few clays ago that the sultan of Turkey, himself the accepted 
spiritual head of 200,000,000 Moslems throughout the world, told me of his 
yearning for a prophet to come from God to lead aright the stumbling feet of 
the world. In this he was but one of a dozen with whom I have conversed 
since leaving New York harbor — a much decorated British general in a high 
administrative post confessing himself baffled unless there shall arise a great 
spiritual leader for the race ; Venizelos, the one man who is Greece's greatest 
asset, speaking wistfully of a spiritual rebirth; another, a romantic figure from 
the desert, a hero and a champion, talking not of battles, but of whence and how 
we may expect a new interpreter of the Eternal ; another a powerful and wealthy 
business man with whom I dined in Paris, freely declaring that the social tangle 
of the times cannot be unraveled unless there shall come a clear Voice calling to 
the spirits of men, 'This is the way, walk ye in it;' others, American officers in 
France, ripened by their own great deeds musing upon the possibility of a 
Personality who may merge the distracted and divergent minds of men into 
one common purpose of good will ; still another himself a soldier saint, troubled 
in soul, because in his America there had arisen no great spiritual leader to call 
in prophet tones the nation back to God." 

Never heard of Joseph Smith, I presume ; had never heard that 
there are prophets in this day and age, as once on a time ! 

"It would be less than honest journalism, did I fail to report that amid 
the welter and turbulence and discordance of world politics which is my pres- 
ent assignment, I find among thoughtful men of every creed and country a 
decided note of spiritual wistfulness and expectancy. We are too serious now 
for the mercenary and mechanical methods of a noisy evangelist, uttering 
only safe and remunerative sensationalism ; we want a man from some P'atmos 
who can say, 'Thus saith the Lord.' " 

W onderful ! Nothing more prophetic within the lids of the P>ible 
than what was uttered by that man, in ascertaining the ideas, hopes, 
and aims, and ideals of the grelat thinking men of the world at the 
present time ; conversed with the Sultan of Turkey ; conversed with 
men high in government circles in different nations of Europe, and 
high in different walks of life in other avenues, and came to this con- 
clusion: that unless a man comes who can say, "Thus saith the Lord," 
we will still be groping in the darkness ! 

We Have such a man, we have such an office, such power, and 
such authority. We have one who is able to say, "Thus saith the Lord." 
The proposition before the small, limited force of missionaries in this 
age is to get that message before the people. In doing so, various expe- 
riences come to them. It is a difficult task. You recollect that the 
Savior — Deity himself — dwelling upon the earth here in the flesh, 
ministering for something like three years among the children of men, 
only succeeded in bringing to the light a few in number. The vast, 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



untold millions did not hearken to his message. And so it is in this 
dispensation. 

But those whom the gospel reaches are transformed, in some 
fashion, so that the world recognizes there is a difference. They can 
tell a "Mormon" boy and girl in the Samoan Islands las far as they can 
see them, we are told. One fine evening, seventeen years ago, a group 
of "Mormon" boys and girls from our school village, at Mapu Saga, 
with President William A. Moody leading, went into the harbor of 
Pago Pago in a row boat. Tied to the wharf of the American Naval 
Station, there lay a United States gunboat. President Moody was 
struck with the spirit of inspiration and said to the boys and girls, 
"When we get under the stern of this vessel, begin singing the song, 
'One day nearer home,' and we will see what effect it has." As these 
boys' and girls' voices rang out over the placid wlaters of the harbor, 
officers and men came to the rail of their vessel and peered down. 
They ascertained that it was the "Mormon" boys and girls coming 
down from our school village up the coast. We had scarcely reached 
our conference headqularters at the head of the harbor when a man 
from the ship, sent by its captain, who is usually a man high in Amer- 
ican naval circles, came and said, "Will you see that these boys and 
girls come on our ship and sing tomorrow?" We had seventy-five 
boys and girls who were walking down the coast, in addition to the 
rest, and we seized that opportunity, and President Moody and others 
of us were taken into the officers' quarters and dined with them as 
the boys and girls gave a program in English. Without exception they 
were clean and pure, externally and internally, and the effect upon those 
men was almost electrical. And numbers of those men, who remain 
three and four years, time and again bore testimony in this fashion, 
"We don't know your boys' and girls' names, but as far as we can see 
the faces of those boys and girls we know that they are 'Mormons.' 
Their faces fairly shine with a different sort of intellectual expression." 

What effect does this gospel have upon people, when we purify 
ourselves, when we strive like the Saints out in the world? There 
is a wonderful transformation comes over them. We have in the 
Hawaiian Islands, where Brother E. Wesley Smith labored, a colony of 
Samoan Saints, numbering more than sixty. By the way. Brother 
Smith and I, although I feel that we have always known each other, 
never met until a short time ago ; nor Brother Knight and I. We 
were laboring out in the mission field and became acquainted through 
correspondence. In the Hawaiian mission field now, there is a man 
from Samoa, with his wife and seven children. Upon the completion 
of the temple at Laie, our people seemed to be seized with an intense 
desire to accumulate enough of this world's goods to go to the temple, 
and we called some of our men and women there. We said to this 
man, Aulelio, "It is 2,500 miles, which is a long ways off, but if you 
can secure enough to go there, go and take your wife, and go as soon 
as you desire. This man had labored as a missionary for twenty 



ELDER JOHN Q. ADAMS 



107 



years, without pay, something that people of the world cannot realize 
or appreciate. Of course, he could not accumulate much, but through 
the blessings of God, he was able to sell his home and sell his rolls of 
matting that he used for chairs and bedding, and everything in the 
world they owned, four or five head of cattle, and ducks and chickens, 
and managed to scrape together $600 or $700, took the entire amount 
to buy their passage, and they are now in Laie, working for the salva- 
tion of the vast numbers of Samoans who have preceded them to the 
other side of the veil. Would you and 1 do that? Until the time 
comes that we would, we will never be in the position of the Saints of 
the world. It is a difficult thing for me, twelve miles north, to come 
here and do work in the temple. But if we had to travel 2,500 miles, 
and sell all that we have in the world, so that when we returned home 
we would have no roof over our heads, no worldly possessions what- 
ever, as if we were just born into the world, but our faith so ripened 
and we should know God so thoroughly — if we were in possession of 
that spirit, then we should be in the position that these people are. Do 
not wonder why 90% attend their duties ; do not wonder why, when 
the elders return from the mission field, they have a little different 
spirit than before they went, or after they have been home a few 
months. 

I bear you my testimony in conclusion that the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the one true system through which you and I shall or may 
attain to perfection, or at least as near to it as our heavenly Father 
demands of us, because he has said that we should be perfect as he is 
perfect. It is the only medium through which we can attain to ever- 
lasting happiness. 

I shall refer you, last, to a gentleman who went out to the South 
Sea Islands on board a pleasure yacht two years ago, just to show you 
what the conception of the world is of "Mormonism." This gentle- 
man is a man who has made millions in the steel industry, who at the 
conclusion of his life, in that avenue, has gone down to California and 
spends the winters cruising out on his own yacht in the south Pacific. 
He came to our mission headquarters one morning. We were aston- 
ished at first. We had in our keeping a Samoan lady of royal birth. 
She had once been a favorite in the family of the renowned Scotch 
author, Robert Louis Stevenson, who searched the world over to spend 
his last days in a place of absolute quiet and peace, where he might 
write as he desired. He passed away in the early nineties just back of 
Apia, and his body now rests on the top of Vaea Mountain, on his own 
beloved estate. This lady, Laulii, was one of the reigning belles of the 
islands then. In her later years she and her husband went to Frisco 
and were there for twenty-one years. She was received in exclusive 
society circles there, and was the author of a book dealing with her 
island people. Upon returning to Samoa her husband died, and half 
a dozen years ago she joined the "Mormon" Church. Sometime later 
she was stricken with an insidious complication of diseases, one of the 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



afflictions being cancer, and we took her into "Mormon" Mission 
Headquarters, and my wife was ministering to her in our little humble 
home for several months, as she hovered between life and death. This 
gentleman in question was hunting her. He had letters of introduction 
to her from Mrs. Field of New York, a daughter of Robert Louis 
Stevenson, and herself had lived in the island with her noted father. 
He was told at the wharf that Laulii was up at "Mormon" head- 
quarters. To make a long story short, as he left our little porch he 
drew a cigarette case from his pocket and said, "Mr. Adams, there is 
no need of offering you this, because I know you people don't partake 
of this." I said, "You haven't had much to do with us — " to which he re- 
plied, "Three or four weeks ago we were in Tahiti, and we came across 
two or three of your elders there, and we were in port in one of the dim- 
inutive island lagoons. While we were there a vessel came in and after 
being in port a few days, there were something like $7,000 that they had 
squeezed out of these natives in this one small village, and away the 
vessel went to another island, and so it goes from one island to another 
upon which that church in question is established. You 'Mormon' 
people, instead of taking money away from these islanders, as this 
other organization has done, sustain yourselves, do not draw any salary 
from your Church ; and upon offering those elders in Tahiti tobacco, 
they refused it; and wherever I meet a 'Mormon' elder I shall not 
insult him by offering him tobacco." And he further said, "Mr. Adams, 
will you please tell me something concerning your work, what there 
is about your Church that seems to distinguish it from all others? 
I shall always advocate it, and wherever I go in the future, and 'Mor- 
monism' is the topic, and the people are pelting you with epithets, I 
will say that in 'Mormonism' I have discovered the true Spirit of 
Christ, more nearly than in any other church organization on earth." 

This man had turned in disgust from all the churches, knowing 
that they did not exhibit the Spirit of Christ. He left us and went 
down to the Tongan Islands, and thence on to Fiji. We received a 
very fine letter from him, when he got to California, and the result 
is that they are going to erect a monument to this good woman. She 
had later passed away in our home. Think of it ! He said that he had 
discovered in the "Mormon" Church more nearly the Spirit of Christ 
than in any other church of his experience. Well, we know that. My 
testimony is to that effect, and I leave it with you in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

My dear brethren and sisters, I hope and pray that I may have an • 
interest in your faith and prayers, that the Spirit of the Lord will 
direct my remarks as it has done the remarks of Elder Adams.

We will transfer our thoughts from the extreme tropical climate 
to a northern climate, in which I have been laboring. It was very 
difficult to get into Sweden on my recent last mission, owing to the 
fact that there were technicalities regarding the signing of passports. 
After being refused passport visas at Chicago, New York, and Wash- 
ington, we decided to go on to England and try there. President 
McKay took us down to the office of the Swedish Consul, at which 
place, after no difficulty whatever, we received our passports and 
continued our journey to Sweden. After arriving in Sweden we felt 
that everything was all right and we would be permitted to fill our 
missions without further hindrance ; but, to our surprize, after having 
been there only a few days we were politely informed that our pass- 
port visas had been cancelled and that not only we but all the elders 
in Sweden were to leave at once. How sad and heavy-hearted we 
felt at this news. But we had faith in our heavenly Father, and we 
believed that he would assist and help us in every way; so we used 
every means possible to obtain the proper signatures to our passports. 
It was of no avail. I personally petitioned three times to the King of 
Sweden in order to get a pass endorsed but the third time my pass 
was returned, and I was told by the chief of police, or rather his repre- 
sentative, that our presence was not wanted longer. Still we did not 
feel that we could give up, and we used every means possible to remain 
in that country. We employed the services of an attorney, and when 
we explained what we had done, he said, "Gentlemen, there is nothing 
else to do but for you to leave this country and go back to your 
homes." We were glad that we had used every means that even he 
could employ, though we still thought there was one more way, and that 
was to rely on the Lord. We called a fast. By this time two or three 
weeks had passed, and the word had gone to England and America 
that we were finding it difficult to remain in the Old country. I am 
sure that the prayers to the Lord from you people were answered in 
blessings to us. We felt your prayers and your faith. I bear testimony 
to you today that it was through the faith and prayers of our brethren 
and sisters, both at home and abroad, and through the blessings of 
our heavenly Father that the hearts of the officials of that government 
were softened to some extent, so that we were permitted to remain 
and complete our missions. 

This was in fulfilment of a prophecy and blessing pronounced 
upon our heads when we left for our mission field. President George 
F. Richards gave me a blessing in which it was promised that I should 
go to Sweden, perform an honorable mission, and after having com- 
pleted that mission, return to my home. I never stressed the prom- 
ise so much, until I had been in the mission field nearly two years. 
Then I thought of my blessing, and that part in particular which per- 
tained to my staying there until my mission was completed and ful- 
filled. Truly I thanked God for a prophet and for prophets, whom 
we have in the Church to lead, guide, and direct us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The Swedish mission is in a flourishing condition, considering 
the shortage of missionaries. We had but nineteen missionaries in a 
country that has about six millions of people. The elders were united, 
they were good men of various occupations in life ; men who had come 
into the field, leaving their homes, families, and their all to preach the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. They found joy and pleasure in their labors. 
We found many friends in that good country ; so many that we 
could not fill the appointments with the few elders at hand. We went 
into the Arctic Circle, the country of the midnight sun, where we were 
met with open arms by both Saints and non-members. Many opened 
their doors and asked us to be guests in their home. We were pleased 
to bear our testimonies to them and tell them of the revealed gospel of 
Jesus Christ. ' 

I am impressed to tell you of a letter I received. It contained, in 
brief, the following account. A certain man, who lived near the Arctic 
Circle, had been reading in Revelations, the 14th chapter, 6th and 7th 
verses, where it speaks of an angel that should come to the earth with 
the everlasting gospel. He had taken this to heart and was ready to 
receive the message of that angel. But where to find him or anything 
regarding the visitation of angels to the earth, he did not know. So 
he went to a neighboring town and visited every book store, asked 
the clerks of the book stores for any book that would tell him of the 
visitation of angels to the earth. Of course they could not, but he 
persisted : "I must find something that will give me light on this 
subject." In an old second-hand store he asked concerning the min- 
istration of angels coming to earth in these days. Me was told that 
those days are past. But just as he was leaving the clerk said, "Just 
a moment ; I believe I can give you some information regarding this. 
T have seen a book with the picture of an angel printed on its front 
page," referring to the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and 
Covenants in which a representation of the Angel Moroni is found 
in the Swedish editions. After making some inquiries they finally 
obtained our headquarter's address at Stockholm. The letter of in- 
quiry, in part, told this story : "Please send one of your representatives, 
a missionary, to my home as soon as possible, because I want to hear 
of this angel, I want to hear of the gospel of Jesus Christ, because I am 
sick both in body and mind but more concerned about my spiritual 
welfare than that of my body." You can imagine the thrill that came 
to us when we read this letter, and how we longed to get there and 
preach the gospel to this man. I sent President Mathias Erickson, 
who was on his third mission in Sweden, a noble man and a wonder- 
ful defender of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to visit this man. When 
he arrived he was received by the man and bis wife with open arms. 
Pie remained with them some days, and had the privilege of baptizing 
the man into the Church and confirming him a member. And today he 
is a happy man. 

Brethren and sisters, the people are strong, stalwart, kind and 



ELDER ISAAC P. THUNELL

good-hearted. Every one of us missionaries are more than grateful 
for the kindnesses shown to us. Among them are many of the blood 
of Israel, and I am proud to have been born in that country, and thank- 
ful to God that the elders visited my parents and that they received 
the gospel. The gospel is being extensively preached everywhere in 
that country. I had the privilege of filling a mission there in 1907-8-9, 
and the interest is greater now than then. A wave of spirituality has 
come over the people, and they are longing to hear more of religion. 
New sects are arising and new churches are springing up. But we 
need not go astray, for we have a prophet to lead and guide us aright. 

While in Sweden I read a pamphlet published by a certain asso- 
ciation, telling of a meeting held in Gothenburg, at which about 300 
Lutheran priests attended, and the substance of this pamphlet was 
that one of the Lutheran priests got up and said, "Ladies and gentle- 
men (for there were a few ladies present also, as guests of these men), 
we are assembled to discuss the vital things of our religion, but I 
want to tell you that we are each and every one of us hypocrites. We 
cannot follow Christ if we follow the rituals of our Church." And 
then he went on to enumerate what they had to teach, what they had 
to pray for, whether they wished to do so or not. He said, "No matter 
how obnoxious we may seem to the public and the people, no matter 
how much they hate our doctrine or what we teach, we cannot change 
it, nor can we change our positions as did the Savior of mankind. If 
the people did not treat him kindly in one place, he would move to 
another and teach the people there. But we are planted down in one 
parish and cannot move, even if we want to. The religion that we 
are teaching is inadequate." 

One of the leading ministers of that country stood openly in a 
meeting and said that he did not believe in God. "There is no living 
God," he said. And his ideas conform to the modern ideas of today 
that Jesus Christ is not the Son of God but the son of Joseph. That 
was his thought, and he expressed it openly, and yet on Sunday he 
preached the doctrines and creed of the Church. 

I attended a meeting where an atheist spoke. "Can religion save 
the world? Religion has not made any progress in the last two 
thousand years; it has not made people better." A discussion was 
held after, and I had the privilege of saying a few words. I said, 
"Yes, religion can save the world, if it is a religion revealed from God 
our heavenly Father, founded upon truth, founded upon revelation. 
It can save the world both spiritually and materially. I related the 
message of the restored gospel to the Latter-day Saints and I was 
proud to bear my testimony that this message had brought people from 
all over the world in unity together; and that though from different 
nations, and different tongues, they were welded together in one 
Church, where unity existed. A majority of these people own their 
own homes, and spiritually, financially and materially the gospel of 
Jesus Christ is saving them. We are blessed with all of these things. 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We know that the gospel of Jesus Christ will persist. I fully agree 
with President Grant in what he said in his opening speech, that a 
marvelous work and a wonder has been brought to the world. It is 
a saving gospel — the true Church of Christ. 

I have often thought and wondered, brethren and sisters, how 
Job felt when the Lord spoke to him from the whirlwind ; and John 
the Revelator, on the Isle of Patmos, when he heard the voice of the 
Savior. It pierced him, through body and soul, you might say. I 
had a thrilling experience yesterday, standing in the store in which 
I am employed, listening to the conference sermons through the radio. 
All at once I heard a prophet's voice, one that we all know, President 
Heber J. Grant call out my name, saying that if Elder Isaac P. 
Thunnell and Elder A. , William Lund are in the audience, they will 
please come to the stand. There was a thrill went through me, and 
it made me think, and I have thought a great deal about that ever 
since. We have been told, brethren and sisters, that a still small voice 
will dictate to us what we should do and what we should not do ; we 
have been told that if we live perfectly, this voice will not fail us. 
Sometimes we do not live as perfectly as we should do, and therefore 
we lose the spirit and communication with this voice. We must place 
ourselves in harmony with the Lord, because he can and will give us 
inspiration if we seek for it. 

This is a marvelous work and a wonder that the Lord has begun 
upon the earth, and I am willing with you, brethren and sisters, to 
work with all my might for the furtherance of this great work in the 
earth. I have often thought about the vision of Isaiah, who saw in 
vision the tops of the mountains, the everlasting hills, where the 
Llouse of the Lord should be established. I have said to myself, how 
wonderful it must have been for him to look into the future! 
I have come to the conclusion that the Lord kept this spot of earth 
for the Latter-day Saints, that they might here in peace and plenty 
rejoice together with one another over the blessings that he had pre- 
pared for them. For centuries the Lord has caused the rains and 
snows to fall in the mountains so that the most precious soil from the 
hills would be washed down into the valleys. Our cities are built 
in the shadow of the hills, whence the rich soil has been washed down 
for centuries. The Lord knew where to send us. He prepared this 
land for centuries before we came here. Let us appreciate our bless- 
ings to the full. 

I bear my testimony that I know the restored gospel is true. 
I have had many testimonies through the Spirit of the Lord of its 
divinity. I am willing with you to go forward from this day on to 
help to further the work of the Lord in the world. I ask the bless- 
ings of the Lord upon each and every one of us, that we may live 
by the inspiration of his Spirit and enjoy its blessings at home even as 
we did in the mission field, and we shall, if we live for it, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER E. WESLEY SMITH 

Former President of the Hawaiian Mission 

Thus far, during conference, I have been thrilled, and I would 
that the preceding speakers had continued on in their splendid endeavor 
to give us those thoughts that are faith-promoting. I feel rather weak 
in standing here. It is my desire, however, to be blessed with the 
Spirit of God, that I may be able to speak forth words pleasing and 
beneficial to all present. We have listened attentively to the previous 
speakers concerning the good people of far-of f Samoa, and the splendid 
Saints in the land of Sweden, now may I bring you back again to the 
land of the Pacific, to Hawaii, the land of my birth. I naturally feel 
a love for the good people in the "Paradise of the Pacific." It has 
been my good fortune to spend practically a third of my life in the 
mission field, the happiest time and the most blessed in my life. 

I desire to give just a brief report of four years' work there while 
I presided over that mission, that you may know your sons and 
daughters called to the mission field under the inspiration of God are 
bringing forth good fruit into the fold of Christ, that his work is 
growing and being magnified among the people. In harmony with 
President Adam's statement, "Mormonism" is printing itself upon the 
good people throughout the world. "By your fruits you shall be 
known." We can preach with far greater power through example — the 
way we live and act — than we can by word of mouth. 

Dr. Sullivan, an anthropologist of renown in the United States 
Government service, having spent many years in America, and in 
Mexico among the Indians, visited in the Hawaiian Islands, studying 
the people, under the direction of the Pauahi Museum, trying to learn 
where the Polynesian peoples came from, spending $50,000 a year in 
research work along this line. I had the privilege of going with Dr. 
Sullivan around the islands. He paid our people a splendid compli- 
ment. Starting out on his journey, he wrote to me saying, "I am 
unable to get the information from the natives that I desire ; they seem 
to be timid about giving it." Other ministers had served with him, 
but they did not understand the natives, not knowing their language, 
and thus I went with him and some of the elders. They were not 
timid in the least; knowing that it was the desire of the elders of the 
Church that they give this information, they were free and open, did 
not hesitate, and he marveled about the influence the "Mormon" elders 
had over the natives. He said, "The moment I go into a home here, 
I can tell whether they belong to your Church or not." "How can 
you tell?" I asked. He said, "Because they seem to be superior; their 
home life is better, there is a sweeter atmosphere there. You people 
have been very wise, going among this glorious race, selecting the 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



choicest of the people; for I find that the choicest people in the land 
of Hawaii belong to your Church." 

"Mormonism" made them thus ; it was not the work of the elders, 
but the inspiration of God that filled their souls. The principles of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is what has magnified the 
people, both there and in Samoa and the rest of the world. 

Oftimes I have read of how the gospel should be preached, how 
it should be declared, from the housetops. I could not understand it. 
In my mind I pictured standing upon some building and crying out to 
the people. But who could hear ! until the invention of the wireless ? 
Soon after my return from the Hawaiian mission, I labored here upon 
the temple block, meeting with the tourists, a delightful work, I assure 
you. I had the privilege of attending a service in the Tabernacle that 
was radioed out at the time of President Harding's visit here, and in 
relating this to the tourists' to show how, if we were in tune we may 
hear, one woman spoke up and said. "I heard that message away off 
in Louisiana ;" another heard it in California', another in Mexico. A 
third party said. "We were out motoring that night, and returned too 
late to get that message, though we had a radio instrument in our 
home," consequently they missed it. A young man, several days later — 
a marine passing through from California made this statement — "We 
heard the choir sing, we heard the organ, and the remarks of President 
Harding, down in the waters of Japan." Pie said, "I had the privilege 
of being stationed with the Pacific Squadron, and on board our vessel 
we heard that message clearly, and how happy I am this day to stand 
in this building near this great organ and testify to you that I heard 
that clearly away down in the waters of Japan !" The Prophet Joseph 
Smith as a boy, being in tune, like unto the delicate instrument of the 
radio, and thus under that influence, went out into the woods to pray, 
and communed with God ; the heavens were opened and he conversed 
with Deity. If man is able to communicate through the radio crying 
out from the house tops and having his voice go round the world sev- 
eral times in a second, then it is not impossible, truly, for God to 
speak to his children when he deems it wise and necessary. 

In the Book of Mormon the parable of the fig tree conveys a 
beautiful thought. I love to read it, for it is full of the inspiration of 
Nephi. Inspired through the revelation or vision given to his father, 
Lehi. he desired to understand the things that his father had seen, believ- 
ing that the Lord was able to make them known unto him — he sat ponder- 
ing in his heart and was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, into 
an exceeding high mountain, and- there was revealed unto him the 
workings of God, the coming forth of the gospel of Jesus Christ again 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith. In that vision he saw the people gathered 
in the tops of the mountains ; he saw the missionaries going out in the 
isles of the Pacific to gather in again the fruits of those tender 
branches that had been taken away from the mother tree, from the 
colony of Nephi, and planted out in the land where they could not be 



ELDER E. WESLEY SMITH 



115 



molested, where they could not have intercourse with other people, 
where the true blood of Israel could be preserved. And thus we find, 
out in the Pacific islands, the Polynesian people, the true blood of 
Israel coursing through their veins. 

The civilization of the Hawaiians before the advent of the whites 
had reached a high degree 1 , considering the limited opportunities ; and 
when the mssionaries came, the people as a whole threw off idolatry 
and accepted Christianity. Today, in education, in virtue, in cleanli- 
ness, the Hawaiians compare favorably with many peoples of both the 
old and new world, while in hospitality no people are their superiors. 
They recognized the voice of the shepherds. Today it is impossible to 
find a Hawaiian who is not a staunch Christian, though they do> not 
all belong to our Church, to our faith. The missionaries laboring in 
the islands during the four years, I was there accomplished a most 
splendid work — and I am delighted to say the elders now are doing 
even a better work. There are approximately 13,000 Saints in the 
mission, twelve organized conferences, over fifty Sunday schools fully 
organized; also Mutual Improvement organizations, Relief Societies, 
and Primaries. This will give you an idea of how favorably the 
Hawaiian mission compares with some of the largest stakes in the 
Church. During the four years we baptized 1,438, blessed 1,387 chil- 
dren, and ordained 457 to the Priesthood. The last year I was there 
we had 2,426 tithe payers. 

The traditions of the islands are beautiful and in harmony with 
the scripture. We find the Hawaiian people today educated; I doubt if 
you can find any that cannot read or write, and they love the scriptures. 
Like unto the Samoans, they are very apt in finding scriptural passages 
and in memorizing the word of the Lord. Time will not permit me to 
go into detail much, but I would like to read just a little extract taken 
from the history written by King Kalakaua, showing forth some of 
the beliefs in the creation, the flood, and Abraham, showing how they 
have in that tradition carried on, from father to son, and so on down 
for generations, the history of their forefathers, proving in one way 
the origin of this glorious people. In this book King Kalakaua states: 

"A trinity of gods exists, named Kane, Ku, and Lono. These created the 
heavens and the earth, the sun, moon, and stars. From their spittle they 
created a host of ministering angels. In creating man, Kane formed his body 
■cut of red clay mixed with spittle while Lono formed his head out of whitish 
clay brought from the four quarters of the earth. Then the breath of life 
was breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul, and was called 
Kumuhonua (meaning the foundation of the earth). Afterwards from his ribs 
a woman was created called Keola-Kuhonua. The pair was placed in a beauti- 
ful paradise called Paliuli. Among the angels was one, Kanaloa, the Lucifer, 
who, when man was created demanded adoration from him. This was refused 
by Kane, whereupon Kanaloa resolved to create a man himself, who would 
worship him. He formed a being in the exact image of Kunuhonua, but was 
unable to breathe life into him. Repeated attempts bringing failure, he re- 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



belled, and resolved to destroy the man created by Kane. In the form of a Moo, 
or lizzard, he crept into the garden of Paliuli and there caused Kumuhonua and 
his wife to do something which angered the gods, and they were driven out. 
The story of Cain and Abel is also found among the Hawaiians in the three 
sons of Kumuhonua, one of whom, Laka, slew his younger brother." 

The Hawaiians, in their tradition of the flood said that, 

"Nuu at the command of the Gods built a boat and with his wife and 
three sons entered therein, taking with them a male and female of every living 
creature. When the waters subsided the gods came and released Nuu and 
his family, who on leaving the boat found that they had rested on a mountain 
overlooking a beautiful valley. Nuu offered sacrifice to the moon mistaking it 
for Kane. Kane became angry because of this and descended upon a rainbow 
and there reprimanded Nuu, and Nuu repented of this, and in token to show 
that his repentant spirit had been accepted and he had been forgiven, Kane 
placed the rainbow in the skies as a token." 

A man by the name of Ktt Pule, representing Abraham, is also 
related by this king: 

"He was ten generations removed from Nuu. He went to the South with 
his wife and slave woman. Ahu. Here he established the practice of circum- 
cision, and was the grandfather of Kuni-lau-a-mano, whose twelve children 
became the heads of twelve tribes, from one of which the Menehune, or 
Hawaiians sprang." 

Now we know through the tradition, and through history given 
to us in the Book of Mormon, that the generations of Lehi came forth 
from the loins of Joseph through Manasseh and Ephraim. The tra- 
dition speaks of how they traveled to the promised land under the influ- 
ence of God, how they peopled this land, grew to' be a marvelous race, 
and then, as is recorded in the 63d chapter of Alma, some of the 
people entered one of the boats built by Hagoth, traversed out and 
were lost in the mighty deep — according to the historians' record in the 
Book of Mormon, but not so in harmony with the traditions of the 
Hawaiian people, which are that God in his mercy planted that tender 
branch out in the Pacific Islands. And now he is bringing them back 
again, and they are producing fruit that is gladdening his soul. 

I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. My whole being 
is thrilled with this testimony, and how happy I am that I have been 
blessed with goodly parents, and that thus far in my life I have been 
able to walk in that straight and narrow path. I sincerely trust and 
hope that the influence of heaven may be upon me, that I may con- 
tinue in God's service, that I may be magnified in his good works, that 
I may keep the faith as long as I am permitted to live upon the earth. 
I know that the Prophet Joseph was called of God through inspiration, 
that he was in tune with the Spirit of God, and I know that all who 
have been chosen to lead his great work have been inspired by that 
same spirit. May God's choicest blessings be upon President Heber 
J. Grant, his counselors, and all associated with them, is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



117 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

President of the Northern States Mission 

You will remember that when Joseph Smith, the prophet of God. 
went unto his heavenly Father to inquire as to which church was right, 
that the Son of God, speaking to him, told him that none of the churches 
were right, and that all the creeds were an abomination in the sight of 
God. I was talking to a man the other day, and he said, "Why, on 
the face of the thing, your church is wrong, because God is not speak- 
ing to his people, his sons and daughters upon the earth, and condemn- 
ing them and placing them in a position where they are declared all 
wrong in the sight of God." 

I am wondering how many of us, the Latter-day Saints, are trying 
to minimize the importance of that message. It is rather a hard saying, 
I will admit; but it is the word of God, the eternal Father, in these 
latter clays, declaring that only the Church that he organized is the 
Church and kingdom of God. God is merciful to his people, to his sons 
and to his daughters, and he would give every one an opportunity of 
coming back into his Kingdom ; and his relation to his people has 
always been one of kindness, and sympathy toward his children. "Peace 
on earth, good will to men," is the message of God, the eternal Father, 
unto his children upon the earth. "Go ye out into the world and preach 
the gospel of Jesus Christ," is the message to his servants, that all 
mankind might see and understand this gospel of Jesus Christ. He 
has also told us to go out and contend against no one, but preach 
the gospel of Jesus Christ and him crucified. That is the kind of mes- 
sage, that God has for his sons and his daughters ; but when it comes 
to the churches of the world, God has placed his mark, and told us that 
only the Church of God is right, and all of the others wrong. In all 
sympathy, in all kindness, and recognizing the sincerity of the people 
of the world, the fact stands out, that there is only one Lord, one faith, 
and one baptism. 

A member of the Church rather wanted to minimize that great 
message of God to Joseph Smith; he said, if God had only said it in a 
little more gentle way ; if he had only made some kind of an explanation, 
so that it might have included all the world, it would not have made 
us so unpopular in this world today. Do you want popularity ? Do 
you want to stand out and be loved and pushed along by men who feel 
that you, with all the rest, are right and can get back into the Kingdom 
of God, following only the way that they may desire to follow? We 
enjoy being loved; we want to be popular because of our honesty, our 
good will, our fellowship for the good things that are done by the 
people of the Church, but when it comes to being popular, as far as 
the gospel of Jesus Christ is concerned, I hope and trust that the men 
and women, the boys and girls, will stand out for the faith of their 
fathers and feel in their hearts that God, in his mercy, in order that 
his children may be saved, has given us the gospel of Jesus Christ ; and 



118

that it is by it, and by it only, that men shall enter into the Kingdom of 
God the eternal Father, whether they belong to this Church or any 
other church, but all must come into this Church, embrace this gospel 
of Jesus Christ ; and all the men and women who belong to it must 
live lives of usefulness and of righteousness, and serve God through 
all the days of their lives, if the)' would enter into the celestial king- 
dom of God. 

Why minimize the gospel of Jesus Christ? Why try to put away 
some of the things that are so essential to the salvation of mankind? 
Why, a man, a brother of the Church, told us a while ago that in some 
churches they have the gift of healing, and, said he, "Surely God is 
placing the stamp of approval upon that church, because people are 
being healed ; and God through their faith is healing them." No 
church that is founded only on the gift of healing, is Christ's church, 
and God will not recognize any church except the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. The same man said, "Other churches 
have the gift of tongues, and surely God puts his mark of approval 
upon these churches, because of the speaking in tongues." No church 
can stand with only the gift of tongues as a foundation. God will not 
give any church as a church the gift of tongues, or faith, or healing, 
and stamp or mark it with his approval, as being his Church, or a part 
of his Church in these latter days. O, there are good people, men and 
women of faith, who, because of their faith, receive blessings at the 
hands of God, for some special purpose, for some reason, but as a 
church, never so long as the Church of God stands; for if he does, 
then we who represent God's Church are on the wrong road and cannot 
enter into the Kingdom of God, in the way we are going, but will have 
to find some other way. I admire men and women who stand out and 
believe in the truthfulness of the Church of Jesus Christ to the ex- 
clusion of all others, at the same time recognizing the good lives and 
the good works of all the children of our eternal Father. 

May the Lord bless us and guide us and help us to understand 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to play fair with it. Let us not excuse 
it, let us not minimize what we have. We have nothing to be ashamed 
of, but, all in all we have something to be grateful for and thankful 
for. that God in his mercy, through his Spirit, has enabled us to see 
and understand the gospel which has been given unto us in these the 
latter days. And may the Lord bless us, help us, and be with us, in this 
our life upon the earth, that it may be lived worthily, that eventually 
we may find a welcome in God's kingdom, I humbly ask. in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

President of the W estern States Mission 

I have been very much impressed, my brethren and sisters, with 
the reports and testimonies borne in our hearing this day. You have 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



119 



listened to men who have labored . in the South Seas and to one who 
labored in the land of eternal snow. Their testimony is to this effect, 
that the gospel message has found lodgment in the hearts of the peo- 
ple and that there is no controversy among them with respect to the 
fundamentals of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Reference lias been made to the wonderful progress that is going 
on in the world ; our transportation facilities, our development in the 
arts and sciences, and our modern means of communication ; the radio 
being especially mentioned. 

It was my good fortune during the summer months to speak twice 
over the radio broadcasting station of the W O A W, at Omaha, 
Upon the first day of June I had the pleasure of speaking, and as a 
result of that service, received letters from eight different states from 
people who had "listened in." I wish the time would permit me to 
tell you of some of the messages that were sent to us. One man in 
Wisconsin, after greetings of a personal nature, had this to say : "I 
listened to your discourse. It was a regular old fundamental sermon." 
Then he made the remarkable statement, to which I call your attention. 
Said he, "I am a student of science. I believe in evolution. There 
is no such thing as supernaturalism. There is no such a thing as the 
beginning of nature. There is no such a place as heaven, no such a 
place as hell. God is not a personal being. Jesus Christ is not a real 
character. Christian theology is not true. Education is, the only 
salvation for this world. Yet I respect every man who does right." 

I was not surprised in receiving such a message, because almost 
daily we come in contact with men and women who entertain such 
views — that Christian theology is not true, that Jesus Christ is not a real 
character. My observation has convinced me that many of our mod- 
ern preachers are responsible for this condition. As Elder Taylor has 
pointed out, they are not teaching the wo>rd of God. They have a form 
of godliness, but deny the power thereof. The Eord declared, as he 
has stated, that their creeds were an abomination in his sight. I do 
not wonder that thinking men are withdrawing themselves from these 
creeds and long established notions and are seeking inspiration from 
another source. 

I have in my hand a clipping taken from the Denver Post. It 
purports to be an account or a report of an article written by Mr. 
Rupert Hughes, who is a magazine writer of some note in this country. 
He gives his reasons why he has left the Church. Says he, "I quit 
going to church because I came to believe that that which is preached in 
the churches is mainly untrue, or unimportant, or tiresome, or hostile 
to genuine progress and in general not worth while. Staying away 
from the church puts me with such an enormous majority that it 
carries no distinction. Nowhere does the increase 1 of Christianity keep 
pace with the population. Recently in New York a pastor read the 
Apostles' Creed to a large congregation, and asked everybody who be- 
lieved it to stand up. Not one present arose." How different with 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Latter-day Saints! Were I to read the articles of our faith and 
ask all who believed them to stand up, this vast audience would arise 
to a man. 

One thing that impresses me is this thought, the Latter-day Saints 
must be forever the champions of the divinity of Christ's mission, and 
ever be his chief defender in the world. I have little patience with 
agnostic Christians, who accept a salary for preaching to please their 
congregations, and who do not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ's 
mission, and who are doing all in their power to eradicate belief in 
him from the minds and hearts of the people who look to them for 
guidance. You go among them and propound the same question that 
Jesus of Nazareth asked of the Jews in his day, "What think ye of 
Christ? Whose Son is he?" and I am sure that you will be astounded 
at the number and the uncertainty of the answers that you will receive 
from them. One will say to you, "He is a prophet sent of God." 
Another will say, "He is the ideally perfect character." Another will 
tell you that he is the greatest of all moral teachers. But you press 
them for something more definite; ask them, "Is he divine? Was he 
God ? Is he God ?" and they will tell you, some of them:, "We do not. 
know," "We cannot tell," "We cannot concern ourselves with difficult 
theological questions." Some of them more honest than the rest will 
tell you outright, "No he is not God ; he is not the Son of God, and 
he never claimed to be, in any of his well attested sayings." They 
will tell you that he was a man in every sense of the word, with 
not only a human body but with human intellect and will, and that he 
bore the same relationship to the human family that you and I bear to 
that family. 

They tell you that Christ never claimed to be the Son of the liv- 
ing God. Did he? It would take a long time to point out the many 
evidences that are contained in the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, 
and Luke. Some one will tell you if you quote the gospel of St. John 
that that is not well authenticated ; that it cannot be considered as 
historically true. Let me read to you a definite message of the Savior : 

"And the high priest arose and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing;" 
What is it which these witness against thee? But Jesus held his peace, and 
answered nothing. And the high priest answered and said unto him, * * * 
* Tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God? Jesus said unto him, 
Thou hast said: * * * * Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting 
on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds, of heaven, Then 
the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what 
further need have we of witnesses? * * * * Ye have heard his blas- 
phemy; what think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death." 

Blasphemy was the final indictment against the Christ. He was 
either a blasphemer or the Son of God ; take your choice. It matters 
not what we think, nor what we believe about him. 

I believe it to be a matter of measureless importance that we know 
who Jesus Christ is. He declared in that wonderful prayer, recorded 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



121 



in the 17th chapter of John, "This is life eternal, that they might know 
thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." It 
is life eternal to know him, and he was particular to impress that mes- 
sage upon his immediate followers. 

As he walked in the streets of Csesarea Philippi, he abruptly 
turned to his disciples and said to them, "Who do men say that I, the 
Son of man, am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the 
Baptist: some, Elias ; and others, Jeremias ; or one of the prophets." 
Then he turned to his disciples and said, "But whom say ye that I 
am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not 
revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." He had 
told them before that no man knoweth the Son, but the Father ; neither 
knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the 
Son will reveal him. 

I see the time has expired. Just one of the thoughts that comes 
to me I would like to express, and that is this : The Lord told the 
Prophet Joseph that the creeds of men were an abomination in his 
sight, that they taught for doctrine the commandments of men, that 
they had a form of godliness but denied the power thereof, and I want 
to bear my testimony to you that that is the reason the world is in its 
present condition ; they do not know the Christ, because they have 
denied the only power by which they might know him. Revelation, 
so far as they are concerned, ceased generations ago, and the light of 
truth has not come into their lives ; else they would know, as they 
know they live, that Jesus of Nazareth is the Redeemer of the world. 
You will remember the words of the Apostle Paul, writing to the 
Corinthian Saints, "I give you to understand, that no man speaking 
by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can 
say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." The Latter-day 
Saints are entitled to that blessing ; it has been conferred upon them 
by the laying on of hands. The light of truth has come into their lives, 
and they are enabled to bear witness in sincerity and in truth that 
God lives, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 

Now, in conclusion, let me say that men may temporize, they may 
equivocate, they may argue, they may explain away the divinity of 
Christ's mission, but so long as time endures, the Church established by 
the Master, in the day and age in which we live, and which bears the 
name of the Son of God, will champion his cause and will be the 
defender of his name, and his mission in the earth. 

God grant unto us power to appreciate the blessings of the gospel 
that have come into our lives. He has spoken from the heavens and 
revealed anew the plan of salvation, and blessed is that man and thrice 
blessed that woman into whose life there has come faith in these 
glorious principles, for it brings peace to the soul that surpasseth under- 



122

standing, it removes doubt, fear, and anxiety, and brings a satisfaction 
that cannot be measured in words. 

May God add his blessings, may he sanctify unto us this ser- 
vice; and give us power to keep his commandments, which the old 
prophet declared was the whole duty of man, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "The Song of the Redeemed," Jean Robinson, 
Naoma Thomas, E. Jenkinson and Harold W. Langton in the quartette 
parts. Benediction was pronounced by Elder Lafayette T. Holbrook. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall at 2 
o'clock p. m., Sunday, October 5, 1924. 

Elder Charles A. Callis, president of the Southern States mission, 
presided. 

The Seventeenth ward choir, of the Salt Lake stake of Zion, again 
furnished the singing. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank .thee, O God, for a 
prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Frank Croft. 

A soprano solo by Barbara Evans Atwood was sung, entitled, "I 
Know That my Redeemer Liveth." 

ELDER HILTON A. ROBERTSON 

Former President of the Japanese Mission 

My dear brothers and sisters, it is with a great deal of pleasure 
and gratitude in my heart that I am able to be present at this con- 
ference today, this being the first time that I have had the opportunity 
of attending a general conference in Salt Lake City for three years 
and a-half. While I am happy to be here today and have the op- 
portunity (which I know it is) of speaking to you, it came as rather 
a surprise to me. 

I have had the privilege, together with my wife, of spending three 
years and a half in the land of the rising sun, Japan. In that time 
I have spent some of the most happy days of my life. I have gained 
a stronger testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ than I ever had 
before. It is worth more to me than all in this world, and I am 
happy to make any sacrifice which is necessary for the furtherance of 
such a cause throughout the world, be it in Japan or any place in the 
world. 

I thought it might be well, inasmuch as the Japanese mission has 
closed, to give a report of the work which has been done there during 
the past three years and a-half and to tell of some of my experiences, 



ELDER HILTON A. ROBERTSON 



123 



through the earthquake, which happened a little over a year ago. I 
have only fifteen minutes, so I will rush through hurriedly and explain 
some of the conditions which are there. 

The Japan mission, as you know, was opened about twenty-three 
years ago, in 1901. In that length of time there have been eighty- 
eight missionaries spend from two to eleven years. Brother Stimpson, 
formerly president of the Japan mission, as I understand, has spent 
eleven years in that land — at that time about one-third of the years 
of his life. Brother Alma O. Taylor, who, together with the first 
missionaries to that land — President Grant, Brother Horace Ensign, 
Brother Louis Kelch, spent, if I remember right, something like nine 
years in that land, and translated the Book of Mormon into the 
Japanese language. We have had 137 baptisms in that length of time. 
Some of these members have apostatized from the Church, some of 
them have been cut off, and many of them have been indifferent to the 
message which the missionaries have revealed to them. The mission- 
aries were united in feeling that the Japanese had had a fair chance 
of hearing the gospel, under the limited number of elders which we had 
present. The First Presidency felt that inasmuch as the people were 
anxious, in other parts of the world, that it might be more feasible to 
withdraw the missionaries from that land and take them to other 
parts, where the people were better prepared to receive the message 
of truth. 

Not all of those people who accepted the gospel have gone back 
on it ; we have at least a dozen Saints who could be called such. Those 
people are very desirous of continuing with the work. Their hearts 
are in it, just as yours and mine are. They want to see the work 
progress. They want to do all they possibly can. But you can realize, 
as did the missionaries in that land, that the thousands of dollars which 
were being expended could be better utilized in other lands, and the 
missionaries must be withdrawn until that people is better prepared to 
receive the gospel. I hope that some time in the future the people of 
that land will prepare themselves to accept the gospel, the road, the only 
path to life and salvation. 

We are told in the Doctrine and Covenants that after the testi- 
mony of the servants of God, earthquakes, pestilence, and disease, 
etc., will follow, and I bear testimony to you folks, to the brethren 
and sisters assembled here today, that those things have taken place 
in that land ; I have seen them. On the first day of September, at 
two minutes to 12 o'clock noon, it seemed that the gates of hell had 
swung open on the central part of the Island of Japan. Within ten 
minutes after the elements had shaken that land, fifty-four fires broke 
out. Within twenty minutes, seventy-six fires were burning, and within 
forty-one, eighty-eight fires were burning. Some of those fires con- 
tinued for nearly a week. 

The people, in fleeing from the flames, came to the steel bridges 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



(spanning the rivers and canals, which cut through the heart of the city of 
Tokyo. These -bridges were destroyed by the intense flames. People tried 
to make their escape in every direction, but the flames came ; the heat, 
which was driven by a terrific wind, made them frantic, and thousands 
of them jumped into the rivers ; they rained into the rivers and were 
swallowed up. There was one spot which was held for army purposes, 
about fifteen acres. This was vacant, and the policemen on duty di- 
rected those people to go in there for protection. They took with 
them many of their belongings which they considered precious. These 
caught fire. After the flames had gone down, the actual count was 
32,843 bodies ; so crowded were they in that position that many of 
them were still standing. 

The City of Yokahama, which has a population of about 600,000, 
was entirely destroyed. Buildings by the thousands were wiped out. 

I was not in Tokyo at the time of the earthquake. I was in the 
southern cities. We had just held conference in a city in the northern 
part. Our elders were returning home from that conference to their 
assigned fields of labor. When we reached Tokyo from the north, going 
to the south, on the 29th day of August, we left on the 30th day ot 
August for the southern city. On the first day of September the 
earthquake came. Had we been one day slower in getting to our 
destination, no doubt we would have been in the. earthquake. Our 
missionaries were protected. In all this disaster, which covered thou- 
sands of square miles, not one of our Saints, not one of our investi- 
gators, not one of our missionaries was injured. Our Church building 
in the city of Tokyo was still intact. Plaster and some of the tile 
from the roof had been shaken off, but other than this our mission 
property was safe and we were supplied with food. This to me was 
a great testimony. God will protect those who keep holy his law. 

While some of those people have not done as they should, in 
keeping wholly the laws of God, I realize that he is thoughtful of 
them, and knows what their hearts are. It is hard to live the gospel 
in a foreign land such as the Japanese are living in. Those people are 
not bad at heart; we have friends there whom we hold just as dear as 
any we have in this land, educated people, men who are holding high 
positions, who care nothing for our gospel, yet were kind to us. In 
all our missionary work we were not mistreated. If you went to the 
door of a Japanese home, if they did not want your tract they would 
politely tell you so. We received no persecution. We were allowed 
the privilege of standing on the street to explain the gospel — on street 
corners, where as high as one or two hundred people would gather to 
hear the message, but we were not molested in the least. If any one 
undertook to disturb the meeting, he was hissed out. And so the 
missionaries who are returning from that land, although the gospel is 
not being preached there now, hold many of the Saints and friends in 
high esteem, and we hope that the time will speedily come when those 



ELDER HILTON A. ROBERTSON 



125 



people will wake up and realize the condition which they are in. They 
are prospering financially, and that is where their hearts are turned. 
We hope and pray that those people will realize the position they are 
in before it is too late, that they will turn to the gospel message. 

I am happy and pleased to be affiliated with the Church of Jesus 
Christ. To put it as our late President Woodrow Wilson said, "I would 
sooner be engaged in a cause that I know will some day triumph, than 
be engaged in a cause which will some day fail." And this, I feel, 
is our position, that although our numbers are few today, we shall see 
the time when truth will triumph throughout the world, and that 
we must stand, as Bishop .Nibley said this morning, as guides along 
the highways to protect those tourists who are seeking for truth, who 
will be apt to accept our message. I hope that we will not only go 
as guides, but also be tourists and be willing to take guidance from 
those who understand the road better than we, who have seen or are 
able to see into the future farther than we, who have studied the future 
and know what disregard for the laws of God will do for our people. 

I trust that the Latter-day Saints may realize the strength of their 
position and ever be found willing and ready and doing his will, and 
this is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY Jr. 

President of the Canadian Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters: I humbly pray that during the 
short time 1 shall be upon my feet I may be in possession of a portion 
of the Spirit of our heavenly Father and at the same time have your 
sustaining faith and prayers. I appreciate fully the great responsibility 
that rests upon one who is called upon to occupy a place of this kind. 
This responsibilty is being felt by me more deeply as I proclaim the 
message of truth to the nations of the earth. My testimony is becoming 
stronger as I meet people and have the opportunity of explaining to 
them, to the best of my ability, what this great gospel of Jesus Christ 
means. Indeed, it means the development of the finest and best there 
is in the human soul. It means, when properly understood, to know 
God, which is eternal life, and eternal life is the greatest of all gifts 
of God to man. I am glad to say that in the Canadian mission we have 
a corps of young men and women who are equipping themselves well 
in defending, proclaiming, and teaching the glorious gospel of Jesus 
Christ. Fathers and mothers who may be present here today will be 
pleased to know that there is not a single one, either elder or sister 
missionary, but what is measuring up to the great responsibility that 
has been vouchsafed to them in carrying this message of truth to those 
who are honest in heart. Their attitude is splendid and their testimony 
convincing, and in many instances, penetrating. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Our mission extends from Newfoundland, on the east, to the 
province of Saskatchewan on the west, a distance of about thirty-four 
hundred miles, and when one travels over that distance four times a 
year it requires practically ail of his time; however, my joy has come in 
witnessing the development and growth of our young people, knowing, 
as they do, that they are dealing with the greatest and most powerful 
thing in the world, for this gospel of the Christ deals with the souls 
of men. I believe that there is no thought that is so sacred and great 
as a thought of God, and when we concentrate upon this thought there 
must of necessity radiate from us the spirit of inspiration, of truth 
and love, all of which gives us a bigger realization of the great power 
which belongs to this organization. 

The outstanding feature, 1 may say, of our mission, this year, 
was the visit of President Heber J. Grant, Elders George Albert Smith, 
James E. Talmage of the Council of the Twelve, Bishop David A. 
Smith, Levi Edgar Young, of the Eirst Council of Seventy, and Sis- 
ters Robinson and Taylor, of the Relief Society organization. We 
have been blessed beyond measure in having President Grant and these 
leaders with us. They left their impress upon the people of that land. 
I particularly call to mind the impressions that were made upon the 
people who had gathered together to hear President Grant and his part}'. 
They are still talking of it. President Grant took for one of his sub- 
jects the three witnesses to the Book of Mormon. After his discourse 
we were unable to supply the number who wanted to receive this 
sacred volume. I believe that had we had twice the number of Books of 
Mormon at the meeting we could have easily disposed of them. The 
visit of these leaders of the Church was an epoch in the history of the 
Canadian mission. 

We are meeting with some success among the people of that 
country. They are a law-abiding people. If you were there today 
you would see the absence of moving picture shows, the absence of 
moving trains (except those that cross the continent) on Sunday — 
they observe the Sabbath day, they recognize law and the execution 
of it, they are a fine race of people, and I am- glad that I have the 
opportunity of laboring among them, bearing witness of the divinity 
of this work as it hais come to us through the instrumentality of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I never tire of hearing this testimony because 
I believe that to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God is the 
basis upon which we can build a firm and a substantial testimony that 
will bring us in close touch with God through his Holy Spirit, that it 
may continue to grow and develop within us. To have a testimony of 
the truth of Joseph Smith's vision is to know that God lives, and when 
that testimony is born under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, there 
ovill be a power and a conviction connected with it that will bring 
souls to Christ, and bringing souls to Christ is our most wonderful 
privilege. 

In reading the statement made by Josiah Quincy concerning the 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



127 



Prophet Joseph Smith, I am impressed with the wonderful spirit in 
which it is written. It is outstanding and full of power: 

"It is by no means improbable that some future text book for the use of 
generations yet unborn will contain a question something like this, What 
historical American has exerted the most powerful influence over the 
destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the 
answer to that interrogatory may be thus written, Joseph Smith the "Mor- 
mon' prophet. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men 
now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History 
deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The man who 
established a religion in this period of free debate, who was and is today 
accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emmisary from the Most 
High, such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his 
memory with unsavory epithets. * * * The most vital questions Ameri- 
cans are asking each other today have to do with this man and what he 
has left us." 

I have wondered as I have studied this statement why it was 
that Mr. Quincy was so impressed to write this "pen portrait" of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, along with those of other great Americans. I 
have wondered why it was that he was so impressed with the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and why it was that lie could not be disposed of by 
pelting his memory with unsavory epithets. One must be in sympathy 
with the same feelings that Mr. Quincy had in order to appreciate fully 
the statements that he was inspired to make concerning this prophet of 
God. I believe that you will with me conclude that this was an un- 
usual statement for him to make, but let us not forget he had been 
in company with a prophet of God — one who had seen and talked with 
God and the Christ and. subsequently, other heavenly beings. No 
doubt when the prophet unfolded to Mr. Quincy these powerful truths 
he left him with an extraordinary feeling that he had been in the 
presence of an unusual being, and his judgment was, that in future 
years this prophet would in all probability be ai greater influence on 
his countrymen than any other American. 

This is a significant thing, a wonderful statement when we think 
of it. But when we know that the origin of this great latter-day work 
had its beginning with this great manifestation, to say nothing of the 
many truths that Joseph Smith subsequently introduced into the world, 
we indeed have something that is worth while — something we can con- 
template seriously as Mr. Quincy contemplated seriously years after 
the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

Men who have communed with God in the ages of the world, or 
at leaist in different periods of the world's history, stand today, and 
we reverence them, as prophets and are actuated in our lives by their 
teachings, and so I believe that, as the time comes and goes, the name 
of this man Joseph Smith, together with the great work that he 
accomplished under God will influence men throughout the civilizations 
of the world, and mankind everywhere will be able to' see and feel 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this work as it is unfolded to them, because it is the pure gospel plan 
of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

There was another statement made, concerning the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, by Governor Ford. It will be remembered that when 
Governor Ford wrote the history of Illinois he devoted considerable 
space to the history of the "Mormon" people. There is a great con- 
trast in spirit at least between the statement made by Josiah Quincy 
and that of Governor Ford, respecting the Prophet Joseph Smith. In- 
deed, they are not comparable. Mr. Quincy wrote his statement because 
he was actuated by the spirit of admiration, a spirit that caused him 
to see in the Prophet Joseph Smith an instrument establishing a won- 
derful truth that had been revealed to him, indeed, he seemed to be 
overawed. Upon the other hand, Governor Ford wrote his history, 
that part of it, at least, connected with the Prophet Joseph Smith, with 
a spirit of fear, contemplating, as he did, what might happen in future 
generations. Here is Governor Ford's statement: 

"It is to be feared that in the course of a century, some gifted man 
like Paul, some splendid orator, who will be able by his eloquence to attract 
crowds of the thousands who are ever ready to hear and be carried away 
by the 'sounding brass and the tinkling cymbal' of sparkling oratory, may 
command a hearing, may succeed in bringing a new light into this modern 
Mohamedanism, and make the name of the martyred Joseph ring as loud 
and stir the souls of men as much as the mighty name of Christ, itself." 

I siay that the statements of these two men are not comparable. 
It will be observed that there seemed to have been a spirit of remorse 
come over Governor Ford in writing this remarkable .statement. He, 
too, knew that he had been in the presence of an unusual being or he 
would not have written this seemingly prophetic statement. 

It must, inevitably be that this prophet of God will arise out of 
the mists triumphantly and will be recognized as the great instrument 
through which God operated in establishing the restored gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, in the dispensation of the fulness of time. 

I know, as I proclaim this gospel message to the nations of the 
earth with the spirit of humility, that I can feel the divinity of it. It 
sinks into the hearts of men and women, and as a result, a few of them 
at least, are accepting this great and mighty work that has come into 
the world in this dispensation for the salvation of the human race. 

I remember most distinctly hearing one of our stalwart converts 
say, "When I heard the message of Joseph Smith the Prophet it was 
the most beautiful thing that I had ever heard in all of my life. It 
appealed to me, and as I investigated, day after day for a number of 
years, and as this gospel was unfolded to me. I could see that it was 
necessary for such a personage as Joseph Smith to be chosen of God in 
this day and time in carrying out God's divine purposes. I felt that 
the time had come for the fulfilment of that prophecy made by John 
the Revelator, "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, 
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell upon the

earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying 
with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the hour of his 
judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and 
the sea, and the fountains of waters." I really felt that there should 
be a man to which this message should be delivered, one who would be 
authorized to establish God's great purposes upon the earth. Truth 
is mighty. No truth can pass away. No truth can perish; though 
generations, disappear, it finds its way to the pedestal where it belongs, 
and sheds its rays throughout all of the world. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, beyond my power to say, that 
I have been counted .worthy to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ 
to the nations of the earth. I rejoice that I have a testimony of this 
work burning within my soul, that I know that God lives and that 
Jesus Christ is his Only Begotten Son, the author of our salvation, 
the institutor of the plan whereby you and I can come back, by yield- 
ing obedience to the principles that are in that plan, into the presence 
of God, our eternal Father, to enjoy immortality and eternal life. 

I do humbly pray with all of my soul that God will strengthen us 
in this land, that he will unite his people in the bonds of love and 
affection that we may have our lives preserved in order to perpetuate, 
to the best of our ability, this great and beautiful work. God grant that 
he will lead and direct us by the light and power of his Spirit, which 
Spirit is truth and love and which is the thing that brings into our souls 
eternal joy. May we stand firm and true to the covenants we have 
made, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Cast thy burdens upon the Lord." 

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

While I shall stand before you, brethren and sisters and friends, 
I hope I may be rid of the man-fearing spirit, and that I may be 
guided in what I shall say by the spirit of the brethren who have 
preceded me in this meeting, and the great spirit of this conference. 
The mightiest thing in all the world, brethren and sisters, is a testi- 
mony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We, your brethren, in 
our weakness have been appointed to take charge of the work in the 
various missions of the world, and you have sent to us from your 
households the dearest possessions of your hearts, your sons and 
your daughters. And we, the presidents of missions, are endeavoring 
to implant in the hearts of those boys and girls that most precious 
thing in all the world, a testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and your sons and daughters are receptive to that testimony. 
They come to us sometimes almost ignorant, in their knowledge of 
the things of the gospel, and I say it to the shame of the households 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



from which they come; sometimes they come to us from households 
where the Word of Wisdom is not observed; they come to us from 
households where family prayers are not engaged in; they come to 
us from households of men and women who know the gospel is true, 
but fail in their duty and attendance upon it, and when your boys 
and girls come home to you they will be a reproach to you if you have 
failed in observing the duties that have given them that testimony 
which burns in their hearts like a living flame, if you have failed in the 
things they have been taught in the mission fields. We may think, brethren 
and sisters, that it is a light thing to have a testimony of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, but it is not so. You have been given a responsibility ; this people, 
bears upon its shoulders the burden of proclaiming the message of salva- 
tion to all the world. Is that a light thing? Let us look into our own souls, 
let us study the thing that has been given to us, let us remember we must 
account for these talents — and a testimony is one of the most precious of 
them; God has given you the talent of a testimony of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ and you must render account for your possession of it. Are 
you bearing it in the earth? If you are not, woe to you when you 
shall be arraigned before the bar of God, for he will not hold you 
guiltless for the great heritage that has descended to you from your 
fathers and that God has given you that you may keep it bright, 
that you may increase it, that you may render to him ten-fold, and if 
this responsibility shall be neglected, brethren and sisters, woe be unto 
us. 

Your boys and girls are laboring faithfully in the mission field. 
They have the spirit of their mission. They are endeavoring to search 
out the honest. They go from door to door. They are met with re- 
buffs and insults; sometimes they are turned away with violence, but 
that makes no difference, they continue with a smile upon their lips, 
and light in their hearts, and a prayer to God that he will help them 
to be successful where hitherto they have failed. When they come 
to us in the missions, they find themselves confronted with this great 
question, "Is or is this not what it purports to be? Is this the gospel 
of Jesus Christ, or is it a myth that has been woven from the vain 
imaginations of men?" And they learn, because they have had the 
seed planted in their hearts and it springs into being in the soil in 
which it has been planted, and by the watering, the rains and the 
suns, the clouds, and the storms ; that seed germinates and bears fruit 
in the work those boys and girls are performing, and they are a re- 
buke in some instances to the households from which they came. 
They learn that the authority to administer the ordinances of this 
gospel is in the Church. They learn that God has delegated again 
to men the authority to speak in his name. They learn that these men 
"who occupy positions of prominence and leadership in this Church are 
veritably the leaders of the Church of the living God, that these are 
his prophets, that these are his inspired servants, and you will hear

them plead in the most beautiful of prayers that God will strengthen, 
keep in health, and bless always the prophet of God, Heber J. Grant. 
My heart is softened, it is melted beyond description to hear the wonder- 
ful,- the beautiful, the touching, illuminating, melting testimonies of 
these boys and girls. They learn, that as compared with the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, these other institutions called churches are 
merely houses of cards, that to touch is to see them crumble. They 
learn just as the scriptures teach us, that the gospel of Jesus Christ 
always has, always will have in it the authority to administer in the 
ordinances of God. They read in the scripture that on a certain 
occasion the Lord said to his disciples, "Who do men say that I am?" 
and some said, "O, they say you are one of the prophets ; some say 
you are John the Baptist, risen from the dead." "Peter, who sayest 
thou that I am?" "I say thou art the Christ, the Son of the living 
God." Blessed art thou, Peter, flesh and blood hath not revealed 
that unto thee but my Father which is in heaven; and I will give 
unto you, Peter, the keys of the kingdom, that whatsoever thou bindest 
on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou loosest on 
earth shall be loosed in heaven. If these churches which profess to 
be the churches of the Lord Jesus Christ, are the Church of Christ, 
where is this authority that one time existed in the Church of Christ? 
These boys and girls call their attention to this significant and over- 
powering fact : If you have, and are the Church of Jesus Chirst, 
where is its authority? The Lord said to Peter, Whatsoever thou 
bindest on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou loosest 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven ; your priests, your ministers, your 
pastors who officiate in your pulpits and churches, when they marry 
a couple, say, I pronounce you man and wife until death do you part, 
and under that contract, that association ceases when the grave opens 
it,s portals to either the husband or the wife, but if they had the power 
that Peter possessed, why should death separate men and women, hus- 
bands and wives, fathers and mothers, parents and children? If they 
have the gospel of Jesus Christ, they have the right to bind on the 
earth and it will be bound in heaven. Why don't you exercise your 
authority, if you have it? You say you are the Church of Jesus Christ; 
where is this authority that Christ gave Peter? Why do you say that 
death separates and forever terminates ? So far as we know, according 
to the scriptures at least, these obligations that are formed by men and 
women in the marriage contract — the most important contract in all the 
earth ! That is what your boys and girls are learning. They are 
learning that the authority to administer in the ordinances of the Lord 
Jesus Christ for his Church is here in the earth. They testify of it. 
It is borne in upon their souls, and they know that God has again 
spoken to the world. 

We do not depend alone upon the testimony of these boys and 
girls to convince us that this is the Church of Jesus Christ. The 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world itself is bearing testimony to this fact. I met a man the other 
day in Portland, a learned doctor, a man who had been educated 
in the universities of Germany. He said to me, after learning that 
I was a "Mormon," "Mr. Young, I want to say to you that the 
Church of Jesus Christ is one of the greatest churches in the world; 
in the East we have Mohammedanism, and Buddhism. I, myself," 
said he, "am a Theosophist. In the West we have the great Roman 
Catholic church and the 'Mormon' Church. These are the great 
churches of the world, and sometime the 'Mormon' Church is going 
to occupy a place in the world that the world has not yet accorded it." 
That comes from a man who is a student of religion, although not a 
member of our Church, not a believer in the truth as we teach it or 
as it has been revealed, but an observer who sees things, a man of vision, 
a thinker, a philosopher, a deep student of the affairs of men. 

A short time ago I attended a lecture in Portland of a great 
judge, who came from the East, the chief criminal judge of Chicago. 
He was lecturing on crime and its effect on American society. He 
deprecated the fact that we are having in America so few families. He 
referred with great pride to one of the kings of his former country 
(for he was a Norwegian) who had a family of twenty-five sons, 
another one had a family of eighteen sons ; another had a family of 
fifteen sons. "We have no such families," he said, "in this day; we 
have no such domestic conditions as existed in those days; husbands 
and wives today are not what they were then, when men and women 
understood not only the necessity but the great joy of having families." 
That was among the themes that he developed in the subject which 
he treated. At the close of his address, and he had been introduced 
very eloquently and exhaustively by one of Portland's chief attorneys, 
I made my way to the rostrum, and as soon as I could get his attention 
with one hand I presented my card, with the the other the opportunity 
for him to shake hands with me. He grasped my hand with his right 
hand, and took my card with his left hand, and holding it up, he read, 
"Brigham S. Young." O, and he read it aloud. And you could see 
the bobbed hair and the skull caps just raise, for their ears pricked up 
as high as they would go. "Brigham Young?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Any relation to the great Brigham Young of Utah?" 

"Yes, sir; I have the honor to be one of his grandsons." 

"Do you know," said he, "Mr. Young, that science is proving 
that the product of the 'Mormon' families in Utah are among the 
soundest people we have in America?" 

I said, "Thank you, judge." 

I am glad and thankful and meekly grateful that I have had 
the opportunity of going into the world with your boys and girls. 
Blessed be the parents that have borne such boys and girls! And the 
opportunity to labor with those young men and women has been the 



ELDER B RICH AM S. YOUNG 



133 



most glorious thing in all my life, and I am grateful to God for the 
opportunity that he has given me to proclaim his word in the world 
in the company of such blessed souls as you have sent us. Live up 
to the standards of these missionaries, brethren and sisters, for it is 
a high standard, an exalted standard, and if you measure up to their 
excellence you will be discharging the duties of Latter-day Saints 
and you will not have buried the talent that God has given you, but 
you will present it to him glorious and beautiful when you shall stand 
before the bar of God. 

And that we may be faithful, that we may sense these responsi- 
bilities, that we may measure up to these boys and girls of ours, I 
humbly ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A duet, "An angel from on high," was sung by Jean Robinson and 
Hyrum J. Christensen and the choir. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to enjoy a portion of the Spirit 
of the Lord while I speak to you. In the Book of Mormon the great 
truth is declared that when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, by that power are his words carried into the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men, and without that power the preacher is as sounding brass 
and a tinkling cymbal. 

When President Heber J. Grant, some few years ago, was in a 
great southern city, a minister invited him to speak to his congregation 
in his church. The President accepted the invitation, and at the close 
of his remarks the minister said, "Mr. Grant, I wish that I had your 
earnestness, your faith, and your testimony." It seemed to me that that 
minister voiced the yearning that is in the souls of millions of world- 
weary people — the yearning to know for themselves that Jesus is the 
Christ, the son of the living God. This testimony : 

"Doth not spring from earthly soil, 

Nor from its wisdom grow; 
"lis not evoked by students' toil 

Though years hath crowned with snow." 

This living, personal testimony of the Holy Ghost comes through 
obedience, through faith, repentance, and baptism by immersion for 
the remission of sins. Then upon the converted soul is bestowed the 
Holy Ghost, which gives that soul a personal testimony that this is the 
work of God, and against which testimony the Savior said the gates 
of hell shall never prevail. This people are not priestridden ; they are 
not led around by priests who aspire simply to be leaders. This peo- 
ple have the testimony of the Holy Ghost, and as the sheep know the 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



voice of the shepherd, so we know that these God-given leaders are 
led by divine revelation, and when they speak, the spirit within us 
answers to the spirit within them, and we rejoice in having the counsel 
and instructions of our spiritual overseers. 

The poet, Parley P. Pratt, said in one of his hymns: 

"The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 
Lo! Zion's standard is unfurled. 

The dawning of a brighter day- 
Majestic rises on the world. 

The clouds of error disappear 
Before the rays of truth divine." 

The prophet Isaiah predicted the dawning of a brighter da}'. Pie 
declared that the time would come when people "shall beat their swords 
into plowshares, and their spears into' pruning hooks ; nation shall not 
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." 
I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ was sent into the world to pre- 
pare the way for the glorious second coming of the Son of God. I 
know it is the mission of this Church to preach the gospel to prepare 
the way of the Reedemer of Israel to come and reign as King of 
kings and Lord of lords. And I bear my humble testimony to you that 
this gospel is spreading abroad, that the hearts of the children of men 
are being prepared for the millennial dawn, and the glorious advent of 
the Son of God will come in the due time of the Father, for the signs to 
precede his coming are in the earth. 

A few months ago I was in Norfolk, Virginia. I went through 
the navy yards accompanied by an officer who had joined the Church. 
I saw a mighty battleship that had never been completed, and yet 
workmen were taking it to pieces. That battleship had cost several 
millions of dollars, but when President Harding called the disarmament 
conference and a limitation of armament was agreed upon, this majestic 
man of war was doomed to destruction. Huge pieces of steel were 
lifted out of the battleship, and that steel was bought by a company 
to be used in the manufacture of agricultural implements and tools 
of husbandry. Really, brethren and sisters, I could not help but feel 
that that was a beginning of the fulfilment of the prophecy that swords 
should be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks. The 
poet Tennyson, in one of his poems said : 

"For I dipped into the future, 

Far as human eye could see, 
Saw the vision of the world, 

And all the wonder that would be; 

Saw the heavens fill with commerce, 

Argosies of magic sails, 
Pilots of the purple twilight, 

Dropping down with costly bales;

* * * And there rain'd a ghastly dew 
From the nations' airy navies 
Grappling in the central blue." 

A few weeks ago near Athens, Georgia, ten thousand people as- 
sembled to witness a remarkable demonstration. The United States 
senators from Georgia, the governor of the state, and other state of- 
ficials were there. And what was this demonstration? It was a 
demonstration that "Peace hath her victories no less renowned than 
W ar." Over the cotton fields, acres and acres of cotton fields, there 
flew airplanes, machines that had been built for the purposes of des- 
truction, and these airplanes did rain a "ghastly dew" over the cotton 
fields ; they dusted calcium arsenate, a deadly poison, to destroy the 
boll weevil which has cost the farmers so much, by destroying and 
bringing about a shortage of the cotton crop. And so the Lord is in- 
clining the hearts of his sons to invent machines to assist in the noble 
art of agriculture. 

Brethren and sisters, the Prophet Joseph Smith was raised up by 
the Lord as the herald of Christ's second coming, to preach the ever- 
lasting gospel. In one of our hymns we read these lines; 

"We through the Holy Ghost 
Can witness better things." 

What better things do the Latter-day Saints witness? First of 
all, we witness the restoration of the glorious gospel for the salvation 
of the children of men. We, by the Holy Ghost, know that that 
restoration hath taken place. By the same power we know that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet of God, that upon him was bestowed the holy 
Melchizedek Priesthood, and because of this we witness the salvation 
of the dead in the sacred temples which dot this intermountain coun- 
try. By the same power we know the glories of the resurrection, 
that when Jesus comes in his glory the righteous dead are going to 
be resurrected and the glorious millennium will be inaugurated. These 
are some of the better things we witness through the Holy Ghost. But 
far above all these things — because these things are dependent on the 
Savior — we know that Jesus is the Christ. Let the world say what 
they will — that Jesus is not divine, that his blood did not atone for 
the sins of mankind, that he did not bring about the resurrection ; we 
know, we witness, we testify by the power of the Holy Ghost that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of man- 
kind, and the author of our eternal salvation. Who would not be a 
Latter-day Saint? "To whom shall we go?" said Peter, "thou hast 
the words of eternal life." The words of eternal life are in the glorious 
gospel and the power to officiate for the living and for the dead, thank 
God, is held by the men who lead and guide this people. 

A few months ago I was in a town in Kentucky, attending a con- 
ference. One of our brethren held a position at the waterworks of that 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



city. I said to him, "I would like to go through the plant and see 
how you purify this water." 
"Come along," he said. 

I saw the great settling vats, into which the muddy water of 
the Ohio river was poured, and I saw a vat containing muddy water 
and another vat containing clear water. 

"Now," I said, "Brother, I can see that this water is clear, but 
a hundred Ohio cities empty their filth into this river; though the 
water be clear, there may be germs in it. How do you kill the germs?" 

"Come and see," he replied, and so I went into a great under- 
ground chamber and saw the huge pipes which conveyed the water to 
the city mains, and at distances of about four or five feet I beheld 
doors which opened into cavities in these great pipes. He opened one 
of the doors, and a flood of light came out. He said, "This light 
is the ultra-violet ray, a powerful, penetrating light. When the water 
passes over this light, the germs are killed and the water is rendered 
fit and pure to drink." What a lesson! When men and women are 
baptized, they receive the Holy Ghost, and this sanctifying baptism cf 
the Holy Ghost, that baptism likened unto fire, does cleanse the soul ; 
it kills the germs of sin, it makes people who love God and keep his 
commandments fit subjects to enter into the kingdom of heaven ; for 
I testify and declare unto you that this gospel is pure, that it purifies 
those who live it, and without the gospel no man can ever be pure 
and enter into the kingdom of God. "But if we walk in the light, as he is 
in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of 
Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." So, through faith, 
repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the 
laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, the blood of Jesus 
Christ sanctifies us and saves us, makes us fellow-citizens in the house- 
hold of God. The Lord be praised. 

Centuries ago Elisha said to the Lord, "I pray thee let a double 
portion of thy Spirit to be upon me." This is the Spirit that gives vision, 
the Spirit that shows the things of God unto man. And so, Latter- 
day Saints, with you, I fervently and humbly pray, "Lord, give us a 
double portion of thy Spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ," Amen. 

The authorities were presented as in the Tabernacle and unani- 
mously sustained. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The Restored Gospel." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder W. H. Branch, of the Sum- 
mit stake of Zion. 



CLOSING SESSION 



The closing session of the conference was held in the Tahernacle 
on Sunday afternoon, October 5, 1924, at 2 o'clock. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The choir sang Evan Stephen's anthem entitled, "Hosannah," which 
was first sung at the dedication of the Salt Lake temple. The con- 
gregation joined in singing the verses of the hymn, "The Spirit of God 
like a fire is burning," included in the anthem. 

President Grant announced that the Barratt Hall had been con- 
nected by radio and would accomodate a large number of people. 

The invocation was offered by Elder Thomas E. McKay, president 
of the Ogden stake of Zion. 

A male quartette sang, "The Lord's Prayer." The members of the 
quartette were : August and Henry Glissmeyer, Cannon Lund and 
Hyrum Christianson. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have a message from the radio operator in President Penrose's 
room. President Penrose heard all of the proceedings this morning, 
most of it as perfectly as if he were here on the stand. He was very 
grateful in listening to one verse of his own remarkable and wonderful 
song, "School thy feelings," and tears of gratitude filled his eyes, 
while listening to this, that he could enjoy the spirit and inspiration of 
our meeting almost as perfectly as if he had been here upon the stand. 
Certainly, one of the most marvelous, if not the most marvelous, in- 
ventions to date is radio. 

President Penrose wishes the Saints to know that his testimony is 
as profound and strong as it was when he first embraced the gospel, 
in 1850. 

Brother George Albert Smith has visited President . Penrose, dur- 
ing the intermission, and brings this message from him. He wishes to 
bear his testimony to this audience that Jesus is the Christ, the Re- 
deemer and Savior of the world of mankind, that Joseph Smith is a 
prophet of God, that his successors are servants of the Lord, and that 
his Church is divine and led by inspiration. He is grateful for mem- 
bership therein. He sends love and greetings to all Israel. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

PROGRESS AND SPIRIT OF MISSIONARY WORK 

In the front row of chairs facing this great stand, with its series 
of pulpits, I see a body of men each of whom has been called to a very 
responsible position in the Church. They are the presidents of mis- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sions. We have been privileged to hear from a few of them, as also 
from two others, they being members of the First Council of the 
Seventy, as well as mission presidents for the time being. These men 
are the directing officers in the army of missionaries laboring in the 
world. The report you have heard from them, and such as you hear 
from conference to conference, and the many individual reports you 
receive from your sons, your daughters, your husbands, who are mem- 
bers of this army, bear witness to you that the missionary work is 
progressing as well as it ever has been progressing and possibly better 
than in any earlier time. 

The vicissitudes of the recent years of warfare have brought 
many people to a state of reflection. Many who have been careless 
and indifferent have been led to consider what this life means in relation 
to the life that lies beyond. Many whose ears have been dull are now 
listening intently for the radio message that shall satisfy them ; and 
it comes sometimes in a very unexpected way, and by unlooked for 
means. This, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, would 
not, could not be what it is were it not for our missionary system. 
Nearly, or quite two thousand missionaries are now in the field, as 
you were told this morning, and many are going and some few re- 
turning. I may s'ay continuously. Scarcely a week passes unmarked 
by the setting apart of a new company of missionaries, who go out 
commissioned to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the nations of 
the earth. 

I am well aware of the fact that some people take a little umbrage 
at what they think is presumption on our part in sending missionaries 
amongst them. They think that we should labor as some of the 
churches of the day labor, amongst the semi-civilized people of heathen 
nations, who have not come yet to recognize a knowledge of the Lord 
and Savior of men. We send our missionaries not only to such, but 
also to those who count themselves enlightened Christians. Our mis- 
sionaries go with a message, not with a command. They go in the 
spirit of persuasion, asking only a hearing, a respectful hearing; for 
they have something of worth to present. Our missionary system 
would scarcely be justified had we nothing definite to present, nothing 
mlore than minor differences in ritual or creed such as distinguishes 
some of the great denominations of the day. I would not blame people 
becoming impatient over such relative trifles ; but we have something 
that can be found amongst no other people upon the face of the earth. 
This is no instance of group egotism, it is a solemn fact. 

We proclaim not only that Jesus Christ is the foreordained and 
actual Savior of the race; not only that, but we proclaim that no 
ordinance of salvation can be authoritatively administered except un- 
der his commission, and that that commission is definite and personal. 
Hence these men, young, middle aged, sometimes aged, and in smaller 
number these women, go out to the world with a proclamation that in 
this day and age, strictly in accordance with the predictions of ancient 



' ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



139 



prophets and with the word of the Lord Christ himself, while he was 
in the flesh, he has again spoken, and is speaking from the heavens, 
directing the affairs of the Church that bears his name, the name 
given by him., not taken by any human assumption, but conferred and 
bestowed authoritatively. We do not send missionaries out to assail 
or attack members of other churches, or the sects and denominations 
as organized bodies. We send them out to preach the positive doc- 
trine of the restored gospel, which is the doctrine of the ancient gos- 
pel, speaking thus of the gospel according to the period of its preach- 
ing upon the earth. We are remarkable as a people for this missionary 
work. 

TWO CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE CHURCH 

There comes to my mind at the moment a conversation between 
a bishop of one of the big churches of the day and myself, dating a few 
years back. He had given some study to the plan of organization and 
operation of this Church, and said to me: "There are two features 
characterizing your Church that I would very much like to see in- 
troduced into ours." I said to him: "Bishop, I know what they are, 
but I should like to have the pleasure of hearing you specify them." 
In the same spirit of good will and fellowship he retorted : "Well 
now, honor bright, I will tell you whether you are right or wrong if 
you will tell me which two I have in mind." I said : "They are our 
missionary system and our tithing system." "You are right." "Well 
now bishop, why don't you introduce them into your church if you 
are so desirous of having them as features of your organization?" 
"Well," he said, "frankly speaking, I don't know. I can see some 
difficulties, but they are small, I think they could be removed. Yet 
beyond these there appears to me to be some great obstacle." "Surely," 
said I, "there is. May I express my opinion as to the reason why 
your great church has not introduced these features? 

THE TITHING SYSTEM 

"You cannot introduce and operate the tithing system successfully, 
for the tithe is holy, and none but men who bear the. holy Priesthood 
in fact and not by name only can touch it. The handling of the tithe 
has been provided for in the law revealed from the heavens. It was 
so in the days of ancient Israel. It is so today, and, Bishop, from 
what you have already admitted in our conversation — which to' me has 
been very interesting — you know that you haven't a single priest or 
even a Levite in your church who can touch the tithe with authority." 
Well, we passed on to the other feature: 

THE WONDERFUL MISSIONARY SYSTEM OF THE CHURCH 

"Why can't we have your missionary system?" 
"Because, bishop, if you tried to introduce it the first thing you 
would do would be to make up a salary schedule, so much for the pre- 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



siding officers and so much for the traveling ministers; and in the 
second place the men and women of your church would not respond 
if you called them. You know that." 

I went on and addressed him as I am speaking now to you : Do 
you think for a moment that the thousands and thousands of young 
missionaries, who have gone out and come home filled with the spirit 
of their work, would ever have put their energy into that labor if they 
were working for wage, such wage as men count in the terms that 
bankers use? Do you think it for a moment? We take our young 
men and young women from comfortable up-to-date homes, provided 
with the conveniences of modern life, and send them out, perhaps into 
the woods of the south where they have to put up with what would 
be called rather rough fare, and rather inadequate accommodations. 
They smile at it all and rejoice in the experience and work all the 
harder. I know it, I have been amongst them. I have been with 
every one of these worthy men to whom I have referred, in their 
respective fields, I have traveled with many of them throughout the 
length 'and breadth of their missions. I have met the elders in little 
branches and conferences, and on their individual circuits ; have met 
them in the woods, have met them in the mountains, have met them 
in the towns and on the highways and the byways. I have felt of 
their spirit, and I find there a spirit that no man can ever develop from 
the incentive of money wage. 

Our missionary system is operated as the Lord has directed. These 
men and women go out trusting in the Lord, and beside those who go 
out, I pray you forget not those who remain at home, those worthy 
fathers, those honorable, God-loving mothers and brothers and sisters 
too, who are working, working hard, that they may make up the 
deficiency in means required by their sons and daughters or other 
relatives in the mission field. For, be it remembered, our mission- 
aries accept anything that is offered them as they may need — a meal, 
a coat, a pair of shoes, lodging — any one who offers such in time 
of need finds his offering accepted, and a blessing left with him. 
But not all are willing so to help; and there is a deficit in every 
case, and that is made up by the sending of means from home. Do 
you know, that, reckoning the earning capacity of our missionaries 
at a very low figure, and considering what that means for one to 
three years in the field, and considering also the means they spend in 
traveling to their fields of labor and in traveling within their fields, 
that the sum will total up above the million dollar mark every year? 
They do this because they have the spirit of their calling resting upon 
them. They go out with this definite message to the people, and you 
can give a missionary no greater joy than to listen to him attentively 
while he states his message, and then discuss it with him in a friendly 
spirit. You will find that he does not try to force it upon you. But 
why am I talking to you, in the second person, you Latter-day Saints ? 
You know the missionary does not try to force the gospel upon those 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



141 



people out in the world; he tries to present it to them for their con- 
sideration ever praying that the Lord will bear witness in the heart of 
his hearer or hearers as to whether he is telling the truth or not. 

These missionaries come home after having been brought in contact 
with members of practically all the great religious denominations of 
the world, firmer, if possible, in the truth and in their conviction of 
testimony than they were when they set out. They have had every 
opportunity for comparison, every facility for discriminating judgment; 
and they come home rejoicing in the sure knowledge that has been 
with them, as a companion by clay and by night, all the time they 
have been in the field. Is it not a wonderful work? And it will not 
cease as long as there are souls willing to accept the message. We 
are using the press, and the press is a mighty missionary, but this 
individual labor will continue. I have heard the remark made by a 
few — it is so insignificant that perhaps I should not stop to refer to it — 
by the few who are a little out of harmony with the system, that we 
have outgrown our missionary work, and will have to bring about a 
revolution and supplant it by something better and more up-to-date. 
What is better, what is more up-to-date than the method of a man 
approaching another with the truth, and bearing witness to it in all 
solemnity? And yet with all humility, earnest in his testimony, merely 
asking the other man to listen, the humble missionary continues his 
labor, for our missionaries have a little of the spirit of the fabled 
ancient mariner, they are not at peace unless they can get somebody 
to listen to that which they have to tell them, because they know the 
value of their message. Do you not remember when Andrew recog- 
nized the Christ at the beginning of our Lord's ministry in the flesh, 
how the man tore himself away from that blessed presence and rushed 
off to find his brother Peter to tell him of what he had heard? it was 
so joyous, something so nearly unbelievable. We have found the 
Messiah; come and see for yourself, come and listen. Then the gentle 
Philip heard and he went off to find Nathanael. You know him, do 
you not — that Israelite without guile ? He was impressed with Philip's 
words, and the Lord addressed him by name. Philip and Nathanael 
wondered about it. Then read again about that woman at Jacob's well 
in Samaria. The testimony the Christ bore to her, that he was the 
Messiah sank into her heart, and she hastened back to the village and 
told the people; and they came out, a great flock of them to see and to 
hear. What of Lehi and his vision, in which he found himself pluck- 
ing fruit from a beautiful tree by a stream. He found the fruit 
to be . delicious, and more than merely good in taste ; and his first 
thought was for his wife and children. Tn the vision he saw them at 
a distance, and he beckoned to them, he shouted out to them to come 
and partake. So are the missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints crying to the nations : Oh, come and partake ! This 
is the bread of eternal life. 

The Lord has declared that in this day and age his servants are 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sent out by him, and that he will hold the world accountable for the 
message which they deliver. In the very first section of this volume 
of modern revelation, the book of Doctrine and Covenants, we read : 
"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of 
my disciples whom I have chosen in these last days." That means our 
missionaries, and those who preside over them to direct them in their 
labors ; and the Lord continues : "And they shall go forth and none 
shall stay them; for I the Lord have commanded them." None have 
been 'able yet to permanently stay the voice of the missionary who has 
gone forth with the word of God. True, mobs have quieted them for 
a moment, but they have been able to raise their voices again. Dis- 
turbances have been only local. 

"Behold," saith the Lord, "this is mine authority and the author- 
ity of my servants," and so on in that first section. Read for your- 
selves. 

May the Lord continue to set his seal of blessing and approval 
upon the labor of the missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

I sense very keenly, my brethren and sisters, my weakness in 
standing before you this afternoon, and I sincerely pray that the 
Spirit of the Lord will guide and assist me in the few remarks I shall 
make to you upon this occasion. Truly, this is a wonderful occasion, 
and this is a wonderful sight to look upon the thousands of faces of 
Latter-day Saints who are gathered, who have come for the one pur- 
pose of being built up in their faith, testimonies, and knowledge of 
the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 

I come to you, my brethren and sisters, as one of those whom 
Elder Talmage hais been speaking about, who are engaged in mission- 
ary work among our Father's children in the world who are yet in 
darkness and who have not yet a knowledge of the saving principles of 
the gospel restored in this day and age in which we live. I thank the 
Lord, from the bottom of my heart, that I have been deemed worthy 
of this call, and the greatest desire of my life is to continue to labor 
zealously in the Lord's work, in the service of his children, with a 
desire to bring a knowledge of him, to as many as may be, of those 
children who are now in the world hungering and thirsting for the 
word of the Lord; for truly that prophetic utterance of Amos the 
Prophet is in this day being fulfilled. Men are going to and fro upon 
the earth seeking for the word of the Lord, and, in many instances, 
have not been able to find it. 

I bring to you a message from the mission in Mexico, and I re- 
joice to say that since the day that temporarily we had to withdraw 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



143 



our mission and the missionary labor from the interior of Mexico, I 
found upon a recent visit there that the mission is now in better 
condition than it has been since that withdrawal. Our missionaries 
are free to go and to come in every part of that country to which we 
have been able to extend our mission work, and we are not persecuted, 
we are not harrassed in our labors, but freely we are permitted to go 
forth among the people and teach the principles of the gospel, and 
many are being brought to a knowledge of the truth. We have 
listened to reports of the missionary work that is being done in the 
East and in the West, and in the North, and now I report to you the 
work that is being done in the Southern part of our country, and also 
in the great republic that lies to the south of us, among the people who 
are descendants of father Lehi, known as Lamanites; and I rejoice, 
my brethren and sisters, that the day has come when the gospel has 
been brought to them. I rejoice more, each day of my life, in the fact 
that the Lord has brought forth their record and that we know who they 
are, and that we are not in darkness as to their origin, and that he 
has given a mighty promise of redemption unto those people who are 
of his covenant, whom he loves ; and that through the gospel of Jesus 
Christ which has been restored to us. 

Not many days ago, in the city of Mexico, one of our elders came 
to me and said of a certain man who was at one time an educator in 
Salt Lake City, and who is now excavating in the ruins that are being 
unearthed under the great lava flow that has come down from the 
volcano of Ajusco, and who is delving into the antiquities of Mexico; 
that in conversation with our elder he said : "Young man, I have not 
proved yet that the Mexican people or the Indians of America have 
not come to this country from Jerusalem. I have not proved that 
they are not Israelites." 

My brethren and sisters, since the day the Book of Mormon came 
forth, men inspired from no good source have sought to overthrow the 
Lord's work, they have sought to bring to naught his purposes ; they 
have sought to make out that Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet ; they 
have ridiculed the Book of Mormon and its contents, and that is going 
on even yet today. And this man insinuated to our young missionary 
that although he had not yet proved that the Lamanites were not of 
Israel, he hoped some day that he would be able to' do so. If you will 
read First Nephi IS, you will read there that the Lord revealed to 
his prophets and to us, through this book, that the Lamanites are of 
Israel, and if you will read in Second Nephi 30, you will find that 
the Lord revealed that this book should be restored unto the Gentile 
people, and that many should believe the words of the book that 
should be written, and that it should be taken back to the descendants 
of those who wrote it, and by that means they should come to a 
knowledge of the fact that they were of Israel, that they are of the 
covenant people of the Lord. And I tell you that nothing in all this 
wide world will ever disprove that fact, and everything that has been 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



uncovered in the great excavations that have been made in that land 
to the South of us tends rather to confirm the fact, than to bring any- 
thing to bear that would deny the fact, that this is the truth. And 
so it is, my brethren and sisters, with everything that has been brought 
forth in this day and age in which we live concerning the gospel of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is true ; ridicule, denial, and 
persecution will not disprove the truthfulness of the gospel that has 
been restored to us. I feel it more keenly today than ever in my life. 
I rejoice in the fact that the elders who come into the field, and the 
lady missionaries, the few that come into our field, are imbued with 
this spirit. They come with faith, they come with a desire to serve, 
and they come with a strong testimony that the restored gospel is 
true, and although men ridicule them and ridicule their teachings, they 
become stronger in their faith and stronger in their testimony, and 
the spirit of the gospel permeates their teachings, and many are be- 
ing gathered out from among the people of the world, by believing 
these wonderful testimonies and messages that are being preached in 
the world. 

I rejoice to be able to report to you that the health of the mission- 
aries in our field is good, and that we enjoy our labors in every sense 
of the word. It has been said to us, in this conference, my brethren 
and sisters, that we, among the Gentile nations, who have been gathered 
out by the gospel, are of Israel, that we are descendants of Joseph, 
through Ephraim his son: this is true. I rejoice in this fact, that we 
have in the country where we labor, and in Central America, farther 
south, and in South America, in all those great countries, blood rela- 
tives of ours ; for all of those people, I bear you my testimony, are 
likewise of Joseph of the House of Israel. They are of Manasseh, 
likewise of Ephraim, for there is a sprinkling of that blood also in 
the Lamanite race that inhabits America to the south of us. We have 
heard that the lands of North and South America are the lands of 
Zion. Therefore, I contend that whatever we do, whether it be here, 
among those of us who are gathered out, one of a city and two of a 
family, or whether it be there, where there are nations of the blood 
of Israel — wherever we labor for their redemption, we are laboring 
for the establishment and redemption of Zion. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may go with us, as I pray 
that they may go with the missionaries who go to all the nations of 
the earth; and I beg of you, my brethren and sisters, compassion and 
sympathy for the down-trodden children of our Father in heaven who 
are in those lands. They are laboring under a curse pronounced upon 
their fathers because of their iniquity; but I rejoice not in that phase 
of it, but in the fact that the Lord has promised that through the 
establishment of the gospel in these latter days, the curse should be 
removed and they should be redeemed and become again his delight- 
some people. I look forward to that time with great anticipation, and 
if the Lord should require it at my hands, I am willing to continue 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



145 



my humble labors the rest of my life in striving to redeem and build 
up and bring joy and happiness that only a knowledge of the gospel 
can bring to the people of that land. 

The Lord bless you, and bless all in his service, is my prayer, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

All over the Church today, at this hour, from Canada on the 
North to Mexico on the South, with the exception of the immediate 
vicinity of Salt Lake City, fast meetings are being held in all the wards 
and branches, and men and women are testifying as to their knowl- 
edge, individually, regarding the divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged. These testimonies, as a rule, occupy only a minute or two or 
three, very seldom more than five minutes, and a great many people 
in each of these meetings pour out their hearts in gratitude and thanks- 
giving to God for the knowledge they have, individually, of the divinity 
of this work. I shall call a half dozen men to fhe stand and ask them 
to bear their testimonies regarding the divinity of this work, speaking 
not to exceed five minutes, each one. 

We will start with Canada on the North, Brother Hugh B. Brown; 
and Brother Joseph C. Bentley on the South, from Mexico ; Brother 
Winslow Farr Smith, of this city ; Brother Edward C. Rich of Idaho, 
and Brother Robert I. Burton of Ogden. 

ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 

President of the Lethbridge Stake of Zion 

It is quite fitting that I should speak immediately after Presi- 
dent Pratt, he having represented the Mexican mission, I representing 
the stake of Zion farthest North. The Lethbridge stake comprises 
that section of this great country, from a few miles north of the inter- 
national boundary line, including the North Pole. 

I appreciate the privilege of bearing my testimony to the truth of 
this great work. During the great World War I had the opportunity 
of comparing service in other organizations with service in the Church 
of Jesus Christ. Tt fell to my lot to be the instrument of bringing 
to some of our boys certain favors by way of transfer, or temporary 
relief, or leave of absence, by virtue of authority vested in me as 
an officer in the Canadian army. Upon one occasion I was called 
upon, as I thought, to bring some relief to one boy, I was asked when 
in the city of London to visit a boy whose name I did not know. I 
supposed that he would ask for a temporary release that he might return 
home, as I thought to recuperate; and, feeling the thrill of the power 
vested in me by virtue of the uniform I wore, I went down to that 
hospital with the intention of interceding for that boy, with the powers 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



higher up. When I went into the little room which he occupied he 
extended his hand to me, and instead of addressing me as an officer 
in the army, he said to me: "Brother Brown, I sent for you to ask 
that you intercede with God in my behalf, that I may not die in this 
hospital, but that I may be allowed to return home to my widowed 
mother. Will you administer to me?" When this boy made that re- 
quest at my hands, I could not help making the comparison, great 
though it may be to wear the uniform of the king, I never felt more 
pride in my life in any position than I felt as I knelt by the side of that 
boy, placed my hands on his head, and in the name of Jesus Christ 
asked that his life might be spared. I compared then the authority 
which I held in the Church of Christ with the authority held by men 
in other organizations, and from the bottom of my heart I felt to say : 
"Thank God for this work, and for the Priesthood which we have." 
I went into that hospital a proud British officer. I came out a humble 
"Mormon" elder; and I say to you, my brethren and sisters, that I 
prefer membership in the Church of Jesus Christ to presidency or 
command in any other organization in the world, civil or military. 
I bear testimony that I know this is the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and that it is the truth, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH C. BENTLEY 

President of the Juarez Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters, I am grateful for the opportunity this 
afternoon, of bearing my testimony to this great work of our Father in 
which we are engaged. This seems to be a time of encircling the earth. 
While we have just listened to the testimony of Elder Brown, from a 
Northern stake of Zion, which includes the North Pole, and the testi- 
mony of others from the United States, I represent the 'Juarez stake of 
Zion, which extends from the southern boundaries of the United 
States to the South Pole. 

I want to bear my testimony, especially to my young brethren and 
sisters, of this Church and kingdom of our Father, that I know that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that he was the instrument in the 
hands of our Father of restoring the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and that today, as has ever been the case since the establishment of this 
work, our Father has his protecting care over his people. I remember 
distinctly during the revolution in Mexico when General Villa had made 
his attack on the town of Columbus and was making his way toward the 
"Mormon" colonies, there was considerable excitement, for he was 
killing every American that came in his way, and every Mexican who 
had shown favor to the American people. It was thought that when he 
reached the "Mormon" colonies he would completely wipe them out 
of existence. The American consul in El Paso had told us several 
times to leave Mexico and go back into the United States. As General 



ELDER JOSEPH C. BENTLEY 



147 



Villa was marching toward the colonies the American consul said: "1 
have told those people several times to come out of there, now we will 
see whether a 'Mormon' is made of any different stuff than any other 
American." There was considerable excitement among the Mexican 
people, especially in Colonia Dublan, for General Villa was located 
within a few hours march from that place. There was not a single 
Mexican family that felt safe in residing in that colony. We were 
notified by the officers of the Mexican army that they could give us 
no help. It was evident that Villa was marching toward our colony. 
Our people, under the instruction of those who piesided over them, were 
told to go home and go to bed, and trust in the Lord. That night 
they retired, and we were the only people in that section of the country 
who did go to sleep, but we slept peacefully. During the night Gen- 
eral Villa marched within the borders of our colony and immediately 
turned and ordered his army to go in another direction. A year or 
two later when I happened to be in his army, having been detained on 
one of our trips, visiting the elders, when I was taken into his presence, 
he told me that there had been several occasions when he had our 
people completely in his control. He said : "I could have wiped you 
off the earth, without any trouble, but," he said, "I had no desire to 
do so. I like the 'Mormon' people, I like the 'Mormon' doctrines. 
While this is no place for you people to be doing missionary work at 
the present time, I hope to live to see the day when there will be a 
'Mormon' missionary in every town in Mexico, for," he said, "I like 
you people. I like your method of living under this government." 
General Angeles was present with him, when we bore our testimony to 
him of the divinity of this work, and explained our mission, that we 
were there laboring among them, preaching the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ; and he turned to General Villa and said: "This is a 
wonderful work. They are doing just what we ought to be doing, 
but they seem to be doing it in a much better way and more suc- 
cessfully." 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in this great work of the Lord. 
I am thankful to my heavenly Father that I have been permitted to 
bear a portion of his holy Priesthood and to labor in this great work in 
which we are engaged. May the Lord bless us and help us to keep 
ourselves free and unspotted from the sins of the world, that we may 
accomplish his work, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

President of the Ensign Stake and former President of the Northern 

States Mission 

On one occasion a humble missionary in the Northern states 
rapped at the door of a splendid apartment ; a woman greeted him, and 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he proceeded to present his message. She argued with him ; he pre- 
sented subject after subject, and she raised objection to every point 
that he offered ; but finally, in humility, with somewhat of a feeling 
of defeat, he Said to her : "This thing I know, beyond all doubt, that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith was his 
prophet, raised up to usher in this, the great latter-day work." She 
, said : "That interests me, come in, and let me talk with you." He 
went into her home. All the argument that he had brought forth was 
as naught, but that humble testimony, out of the fulness of the heart 
of a devoted missionary, sank into her heart. She was impressed by 
it, and she listened to the word of the Lord. 

Christ said on one occasion : "He that will do my will shall know 
of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." 
This is a law unto us, the children of our Father. We can know, as 
we know nothing else, that the gospel is true. We can know, for it 
will burn within our being, and God will make it known to us if we 
will but keep his commandments. He has given us the law, he has 
given us the great plan of life. It is a wonderful system, a marvelous 
philosophy. It embraces all truth, and it is so organized and so arranged 
that it matters not how humble we are or how mighty and great, it 
fits our needs; and, by rendering obedience, we can know that it is true. 
Its every principle is true. There is no exception among the principles 
and ordinances of the gospel. Each and every one: has its place. The 
keeping of every law is necessary to exaltation in the kingdom of God. 
If we feel that we are a law in and of ourselves, and feel that this 
principle or that principle is not for us, or for our keeping, we deny 
ourselves one part of the great blessing that God has for us. 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that God lives, 
that this is his work, that at the head of his Church today stands a 
man who bears the Priesthood of Almighty God, one whom God sus- 
tains and whom we should and must sustain, if we would enjoy his 
Spirit. This is the work of the Lord. Its purpose is the saving of 
the children of men. At its head stands the great King, the Lord God, 
the eternal Father. It will go on ; it will fill the whole earth. 

All men will hear its message, and the honest in heart will be 
gathered into its fold. Nothing can stay its progress, it is the work 
of God, and it will go on, for God has spoken it. This is my testi- 
mony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD C. RICH 

President of the Montpelicr Stake of Zion 

I rejoice in the opportunity of having the privilege of bearing 
my testimony here in this great tabernacle. I have: done so many a 
time in cottage meetings, in the Old World, upon the street corners, 
and in the halls, and I am not ashamed to do it here. 

About thirty years ago, I was called to go on a mission. I had 



ELDER EDWARD C. RICH 



149 



heard returned missionaries, time and time again, say that they knew 
that "Mormonism" is true. As a child I was taught that it is the truth, 
and I believed it. When I received that call the impression came to 
me that if I would go into the world, I would know for myself whether 
"Mormonism" is true or not. I have thought since, that likely this 
was the deciding factor that caused me to accept that call to go into 
Great Britain to preach this gospel. I returned in a little over two 
years, convinced in my mind that it is the truth. I have received many 
testimonies to the divinity of this work. One of them came to me 
while laboring as a missionary in the city of Bristol. I might say that 
I had never had any experience, or very little experience, in this 
Church. I neglected the opportunities that came to me, as a child and 
as a young man, to take active part and to participate in it. I have 
rued the time of that neglect, and I have been humiliated, time and 
time again since then, but there was no one to blame but myself. I 
had every opportunity to understand the truth, to study it, and to 
explain it. I neglected that opportunity. 

While laboring as a missionary, with three other elders, we held a 
meeting every Sunday evening in Bristol, and during the week a cot- 
tage meeting. At this particular time the other three missionaries 
were out visiting their friends. The time came to hold that meeting. 
No one was present but myself. I had never presided at a meeting in. 
my life. The time came to start the meeting, but none of the elders 
arrived. I selected a long chapter in the New Testament. I did not 
know what it contained. I read that chapter thinking that by the time 
I would finish it some of my companions would be there and they 
could preach the gospel to the people who had assembled. But none 
of them came. I read the chapter, commented on it for about ten min- 
utes, and dismissed the people. After they had left, the landlady said 
to me : "Elder Rich, that is the shortest meeting I ever attended." I 
said: "It might have been short to you, but it was long- enough for 
me !" 

Years after that I attended a reunion of the Sheffield conference, 
held in the Seventeenth ward in this city. A girl came to me and told 
me that her father, prior to attending that meeting had said : "I have 
been to hear 'Mormon' missionaries ; I have propounded questions to 
them, and they have been answering all of them ; but I have a ques- 
tion tonight that I can ask them and they can't explain it." She told 
me that in my remarks that evening the question had been answered, 
though her father did not present it. I knew nothing of it for years 
and years. I have come to the conclusion that the Lord inspired me 
to pick out this chapter, and in the few comments that I made upon 
it answered this man's question. I believe in the inspiration of God. 
I know that he is leading and guiding this Church. 

Some ten years after that time. I met a man on the streets of 
Montpelier, a friend of mine who received the gospel in Ireland, and 
he said : "Brother Rich, I wish my brother-in-law, who is in the 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



British Isles, could hear this message of salvation." I said : "Where 
is your brother-in-law?" He said: "He is in Sheffield." I said: 
"I have a brother in Sheffield now performing missionary work." I 
sent the address to my brother who called upon this family, by the 
name of Fitnar. They were not interested in the gospel at first. Later 
on they received the message of salvation and today they are all active 
members of this Church, living up to the teachings of the gospel in 
the stake where I preside, and in the settlement where I live. I am 
as confident that the inspiration of the Lord came upon that man 
and impressed him to speak to me in reference to his brother-in-law, 
as I am confident the inspiration of the Lord came upon Columbus, 
and that he was inspired to go out upon the waters. It is remarkable 
that of all the places in the world where my brother might have been 
performing missionary work, that he should be in the very city where 
this man's brother-in-law resided, and that of all the people in Mont- 
pelier this man might have approached on the subject, he should 
speak to me about it. I am sure that it was in answer to this man's 
prayer, that his brother-in-law might receive the gospel. 

Two weeks ago yesterday morning I attended, in company with 
Brother Smoot, who is upon this very stand, a man whom the doctors 
said could not live twelve hours. He was administered to, and today 
is rapidly improving and on the way to recovery. These are some 
of the things that are testimonies to me as to the divinity of this work, 
that it is the work of God and that those who lead and direct its affairs 
upon the earth are inspired of the Lord. 

This missionary system of ours is the greatest thing in the world, 
for it gives individual testimonies to men and women so that they 
know for themselves that this is the work of God, that there is power 
in it, that the Lord is leading and directing it. They go forth and 
perform the duties and obligations that are resting upon them, to warn 
the inhabitants of the earth. In speaking of the signs which should 
precede his coming, the Lord said that there should be wars and 
rumors of wars, pestilence, and plagues, and that this gospel of the 
kingdom should be preached as a witness unto all nations, and then 
shall the end come. May God hasten the day when it shall be done, 
is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ROBERT I. BURTON 

President of the Mount Ogden Stake of Zion 

My brethren and sisters, this is a new experience for me, being 
the first time I have ever been called upon to address a body of the 
Saints in this building. I am filled with awe at the thought of standing 
in the place where so many notable men have stood when addressing 
the congregations of our people. 



ELDER ROBERT I. BURTON 



151 



The other day, as I was speeding westward on a train from 
Chicago, and I crossed the Missouri river and again followed along the 
Platte river, I looked at those bodies of water, and I thought, and 
asked myself the question: "I wonder if this is where the pioneers 
crossed this continent, I wonder if I am. beholding a sight that Brigham 
Young beheld, as he led that notable band of pioneers westward?" 
I then felt assured that their hearts must have been made of noble stuff 
to have made such a journey in order to be able to worship God 
according to the dictates of their consciences. Each time I gazed upon 
the different scenes, I wondered if their eyes had beheld those same 
sights. But here I am upon the stand and in a building that those 
pioneers helped to erect. I know that they were here, and I know that 
their presence has made this building sacred. So I feel overwhelmed 
to stand before you in a place that has been occupied by men of note, 
men whom we love and revere ; and we have in our presence today their 
successors, men whom! we hold very dear to our hearts, men whom we 
support with our faith and our prayers, and with all the energy that 
we possess. I thought also of my mother and how she walked across 
the plains, at least a great part of the distance, in 1848 as a girl nine 
years of age, and how she left the blood stains of her feet upon some 
of those pathways. I thought of my father coming here, in 1854, after a 
long journey from England; how they had run out of water and provis- 
ions, almost entirely, upon the ship, and they had been placed upon 
quarter rations ; how cholera had broken out upon the ship, and many of 
them died and were buried at sea. I remembered all these things, and 
I thought: "Oh, if I cannot remain faithful, and firm and true to 
the gospel as it has been taught to me by my noble parents and by 
those patriots, those noble men and women who came out here as pio- 
neers, then I am not worthy of the blood that runs in my veins !" 

All honor to the pioneers. All honor to their successors, who are 
here in our midst. I love them, I respect them, I honor them with 
all my heart, and I pray God to bless them. I know as surely as I know 
that I stand before you, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living 
God, I know that God lives, and that Jesus Christ is his Son; and 
when I know that, all else in this life matters little to me. I feel, if I can 
be faithful, firm and true to that knowledge, to the end of my days, 
I shall be a most happy and grateful man. 

We have heard today, in song and story, the wonders of the 
latter-day gospel that has been restored to us, and my heart has been 
filled, to overflowing, with gratitude to my heavenly Father that I 
have been permitted to be counted worthy to be one with you. I love 
you, brethren and sisters, and I pray God to bless you and give you 
the spirit of the gospel, give you the necessities of life, give you 
wisdom that you may train and rear your children in the way in which 
they should go, instill into their hearts the precious truths of the 
gospel, and a knowledge of its saving power, for this is our mission 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



upon the earth. May God bless us to this end, I pray, in Jesus name, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In calling on the five speakers who have just borne their testimonies 
to you, I did not do so with any preconceived thought of who they 
were. It so happens that Winslow Farr Smith is the great grandson 
of Patriarch John Smith, and the grandson of George A. Smith who 
has thrilled the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, as his father, the late 
John Henry Smith, has done many and many a time from this stand. 
It happens that Hugh B. Brown is the grandson of James S. Brown, 
one of the great missionaries of this Church, a man that I knew in 
my childhood, and I rejoiced in hearing him preach the gospel here 
at home. Edward C. Rich is the grandson of Apostle Charles C. Rich 
and also of Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter, the man who came with 
money, after selling a fine farm in Pennsylvania and buying some wild 
land at Nauvoo, and presented the remainder of his means to the 
Prophet Joseph, because he was in financial distress. Robert I. Burton 
is the son of William W. Burton, one of the late stalwarts of the Church. 
Joseph C. Bentley is the son of one of those early pioneers who went 
to Dixie — that country which I heard belittled by one of our wealthy 
men who said he would not give his forty acre farm in Davis county 
for the entire Dixie country. Richard Bentley went there and stayed. 
He lived there and pioneered that country, and was one of the loyal, 
true men of the Church. 

We will now hear from one of the brethren that the gospel found 
in a foreign land — President Soren Rasmussen, of the Jordan stake. 

By the way, the world said that by the time grandchildren came 
along this work would perish from the earth. We have heard today 
from one great-grandson. That is a pretty good specimen of its 
perishing. 

ELDER SOREN RASMUSSEN 

President of the Jordan Stake of Zion 

My dear brethren and, sisters, I rejoice exceedingly in the testimonies 
of my brethren. As President Grant has stated, I was born in a 
foreign land. My parents were very kind to the elders, and as a 
consequence many of the missionaries had a home there. I remember 
very plainly, some years ago, while traveling on the road as a com- 
mercial man, I was in the city of Elsinore where I stopped over Sunday, 
and the bishop asked me to speak at the afternoon service. After 
closing he asked me who my father was. I told him, and he said: 
"I thought so, when you spoke. I want to tell you that I called 
at your father's home while laboring as a missionary in the country 



ELDER SO REN RASMUS SEN 



153 



where you lived. We had been in the habit of lodging in your father's 
home. We came there on one occasion and the spare room was taken. 
It seemed that there would be no opportunity for us to stop there, at this 
time, but your father suggested to your mother that they would sleep 
on the floor and the missionaries might sleep in their bed. 

I have often thought, my brethren and sisters, since coming to 
Utah, and since having received the gospel, how greatly I have been 
blessed of the Lord, and I feel to thank my parents, although my 
father never joined the Church. My mother, however, emigrated with 
the Saints ; and I may say this in behalf of my father, he was very 
kind to the missionaries, and that he was ready to be baptized. He 
suggested this to my mother, but she was not yet ready. A few months 
after this transpired, father passed away, and mother soon afterwards 
sold out her business and emigrated to the land of Zion. 

My brethren and sisters, I know that this is the work of the Lord. 
I have enjoyed the spirit of this work, and I feel that the Lord is with 
his servants under all circumstances ; for wherever I have labored, 
whether at home or abroad, I have felt the inspiration of his Holy 
Spirit. I want to say to you that I sustain the authorities of this 
Church with all my heart. May the Lord bless us and help us to be- 
come, more and more, his servants and his handmaidens, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has found con- 
verts in all parts of the world — from the country of the midnight sun, 
Scandinavia, to South Africa, from Canada on the North to Mexico 
on the South, in the far off lands of New Zealand and Australia, in the 
Hawaiian Islands and in Japan, and that the Lord has been so merciful 
that no matter where the message of life and salvation has gone, men 
have received for themselves, individually and not for another the knowl- 
edge of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. One of the 
truest, most loyal and magnificent men that has ever been connected 
with this Church of Christ was the late Karl G. Maeser, from Germany. 
He gave his very life and all the strength, the ability and power that 
he possessed for the advancement of the work of the Lord, and for the 
uplift, educationally, of the youth of Zion. 

We will now hear from Bishop Kasper Fetzer. 

ELDER KASPER FETZER 

Bishop of the Jefferson ward, Granite Stake 

I can indeed say it is a great surprise to me to stand before this 
great congregation. I took quite a pride, a year ago, in seeing my 
son on this stand, when he offered a prayer as one of the Boy Scouts. 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I rejoice in an organization of that kind, because it helps to take care 
of the boys who shall be our future leaders. I rejoice also in bearing 
my testimony that a servant of the Lord came to our country bearing 
witness of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I was then 
a member of the officers force of the German army. I had borne my 
testimony before a military court, and I was ridiculed in my position 
that I should join such an undesirable sect, and they told me that if 
I attended another "Mormon" meeting I should be thrown out of my 
office and punished in jail. I was fined, again and again, for attend- 
ing the meetings ; and here is President Thomas E. McKay who can 
testify to the truth of it. I have been in the forests, joining with the 
Latter-day Saints and listening to the gospel of Jesus Christ; and I 
was fined at one time a hundred dollars and another time was told I 
would be thrown out of my position and punished. But when I was 
called before the court and asked what I would do in the future, I 
told them to decide between themselves whether I should not serve my 
God more than them. At that time they testified unto me, as the 
highest officer and general in that Bavarian army, that if I could learn 
the truth, and the reason why the ministers of the churches there are 
preaching to the people, it would be discovered that it was only for 
the reason of better policing the people of Germany. They have 
assured me that the first minister of Germany has told them that 
there is no truth in religion, but that the Darwinian doctrine is 
paramount and is the truth. But, as I told him, I can say there is 
no evidence that a monkey ever became a man, as far as history goes ; 
that there is no evidence of any progress in that direction whatever, 
and I can't see why I should believe a doctrine of that kind which 
teaches us to go down to the very bottom of animal being, whi'e the 
gospel of Jesus Christ teaches me to go up to heaven. It is so lofty 
that it is impossible for me to detach myself from it. So I told them 
I would take the consequences, and I am glad I did. 

I am thankful that I came here, and I can say to you people that 
your God is my God, your people are my people, and I hope I will 
be worthy, in my weakness, to stay with you and be useful. I have 
tried to show my faith ; and even during the war I told the German 
people whom I presided over that we should be loyal first, as the Doc- 
trine and Covenants says, that the time shall come when freedom shall 
come to every nation through America ; and yet when the President of 
the German nation said : "If freedom shall come to the German 
nation through any other nation, we shall accept it," though it was 
hard for those who were really Germans. They can't say anything 
else, after the truth has come out. than that it was a good thing for 
the German nation to become free of their masters who have made 
them slaves. I know the German people from the ground up, as I 
have been mixing with them, and no one can tell me any different. 
I tell you that I know the German people, and that they will some day 
rejoice that they have been freed, and that now they can progress 



ELDER RASPER FETZER 



155 



more than ever. The world will be made to see that there is a good 
foundation ; not only in science, but also in the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
as followers after the great message which has been given in these 
last days. I have knelt down in the forest of Bavaria and asked God 
in heaven for this, the gospel jyf Christ — the truth which he has re- 
vealed — and I know that I have heard a voice from heaven, though I 
have seen nobody, and I know this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
could not deny this testimony, and many other testimonies I have 
received. I assure you it is a matter of satisfaction to me, and I 
desire my superiors shall feel that my testimony rests upon the very 
foundation, and that is the Spirit of God. I ask God to bless us that 
we may join one another more closely, and that we may help one 
another, and especially that the youth of Zion may step in the foot- 
steps of their fathers as we are all called, is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I desire to express my sincere gratitude and thanksgiving unto 
God for the very rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit, during all of the 
sessions of our conference. I feel that we have in very deed had a 
spiritual feast, that the Lord has blessed us abundantly, and I hope and 
pray that we may all return to our homes in safety; that those who 
are not located here, but have come from other sections of the state 
and from other states, from Canada to Mexico, and from the various 
missions, that we may all go home and carry with us the inspiration 
that has ben manifest during this conference. 

I have nothing on my mind that I desire to say further than that 
I endorse the remarks that have been made, and rejoice in the wonder- 
ful testimonies that have been borne. Particularly have I enjoyed the 
remarks of the last seven speakers who were called upon, who had no 
expectation of being called. All of the other speakers were rather 
inclined to worry, as the Bishop said, knowing that their turn would 
come sooner or later. 

Although I have already borne my testimony I feel impressed that 
I would like to leave with this body of people, once more, my testimony 
regarding the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. I know, 
as I know I live, that God lives, that he hears and answers the prayers 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of those who honestly seek him. I know that Jesus is the Redeemer 
of the world, the Savior of mankind, the Son of God. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and that there 
are thousands and tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints who have 
this knowledge, as perfectly as I have it; that God has revealed it to 
them, that they are not indebted to any man or set of men for this 
light, knowledge and testimony regarding God our Father and his Son 
Jesus Christ, and regarding the divinity of the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the instrument of our heavenly Father and of our 
Savior in restoring again and establishing upon the earth the gospel 
of life and salvation, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, which will 
bring to us salvation, if we are faithful in keeping his commandments, 
and we shall thus enjoy the privilege of mingling with God and our 
Redeemer, and the faithful ones who have gone before, throughout the 
countless ages of eternity. 

The choir sang, "Then shall thy light shine," solo by James Astin. 
The choir and congregation sang the "Doxology." 
The benediction was pronounced by President Anthony W. Ivins, 
and the conference adjourned for six months. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by 
Professor B. Cecil Gates. Professor John J. McClellan played the 
accompaniments, interludes, etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward 
P. Kimball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Taber- 
nacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson; and 
in the Assembly Hall by Frederick G. Barker.
